ABSTRACT
Archeological data recovery was conducted by PBS&J at four burned rock midden sites (41VV1892,
41VV1893, 41VV1895, and 41VV1897) located in the northeastern portion of Val Verde County, Texas, east of the
Dry Devils River. The excavations took place between October 2 and October 24, 2000, and were undertaken on
behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation. The four sites were within the area of potential effect for a road
expansion project along U.S. Highway 277, about 50 miles north of Del Rio, Texas. The four sites were located in
September 2000 during initial clearing of the highway right-of-way preparatory to construction. Emergency data
recovery excavations conducted at all four sites consisted of mechanical excavation of trenches across each of the
six burned rock middens and hand excavation of 50-x-50-cm units at systematic intervals along the trenches.
Approximately 17.5 square meters (m2) (187.5 square feet) was hand excavated at all four sites.
Site 41VV1892 contained a single burned rock midden, roughly oblong in shape, oriented north to south, and
measuring about 17.75 m long by about 10.5 m across. The internal configuration of the midden, as revealed by two
backhoe trenches, suggests that there were at least two "center-focused cooking facilities" at the site. Five
radiocarbon samples dated the use of the first facility to the Late Archaic period, between A.D. 250 and 520, and the
use of the second facility to the Late Prehistoric period, between A.D. 780 and 1190. Charred plant remains
recovered from 41VV1892 indicate, at minimum, the use oflittleleafwalnut during the Late Archaic period and the
use of prickly pear and sotol/yucca during the Late Prehistoric period.
Site 41VV1893 contained three burned rock middens, designated Midden 1, Midden 2, and Midden 3. All
three are believed to originally have been roughly circular in shape. Midden 1 is believed to have originally
measured about 12.75 m across, Midden 2 may have originally been about 9.5 m across, and Midden 3 may have
also been about 12.75 m across. The internal configuration of Midden 1, as revealed by two backhoe trenches,
suggests that there was at least one "center-focused cooking facility" in the midden. The internal configuration of
Midden 2 and Midden 3 could not be investigated since the center of the two middens was outside the highway
right-of-way. A series of AMS dates run on charred plant remains from each midden suggests that all three were in
use during the early part of the Middle Archaic period (2200-3080 B.C.); that Midden 3 continued in use during the
latter part of the Middle Archaic period (1650-1880 B.C.) and the early part of the Late Archaic period (940-1290
B.C.); and that Midden 2 was in used during the latter part of the Late Archaic period (A.D. 530-650) and the early
part of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 1010-1180). The charred plant remains recovered from the three middens at
41VV1893 indicate, at minimum, the use of sotol/yucca, littleleaf walnut, and possibly juniper fruit during the
Middle Archaic, and the use of littleleaf walnut during the early part of the Late Archaic.
Site 41VV1895 consisted of a single burned rock concentration or scatter, roughly oblong in shape, oriented
northwest to southeast, and measuring about 19.5 m long by about 12.5 m across. The concentration was not
mounded and cannot reasonably be called a burned rock midden. No firm evidence of a "center-focused cooking
facility" was revealed at the site by the trenching, although varying densities of burned rocks suggested that the
north central portion of the concentration may have been the location of one or more cooking areas (presumably
containing earth/rock ovens), with secondary burned rock refuse deposited in the southern and eastern portions of
the concentration, where it seemed to form a partial ring or arc of discarded debris. Four AMS radiocarbon dates run
on charred plant remains from 41VVl895 all indicate that the site dates entirely to the Late Prehistoric period,
between about A.D. 1170 and 1460. The charred plant remains recovered from 41VV1895 indicate the definite use
of juniper/cedar wood and sotol/yucca during the Late Prehistoric period; and the probable use of acacia, mesquite,
Mexican persimmon, and oak for wood, and littleleaf walnut for food. Desert hackberry may also have been used for
wood, although only seeds were identified.
Site 41VVl897 contained a single burned rock midden, roughly oval in shape, oriented northwest to southeast,
and measuring about 15.5 m long by about 12.5 m across. The internal configuration of the burned rock midden, as
revealed by a backhoe trench and the horizontal distribution of burned rocks, suggests that there were at least two

111

areas of"center-focused cooking facilities" at the site. One feature was identified within the midden, apparently the
remnants of a partially dismantled earth/rock oven, estimated to have measured about a meter across. A single
radiocarbon sample taken from the old ground surface beneath the midden may date an earlier, "pre-midden"
occupation at the site to the Middle Archaic period, between 1890 and 2140 B.C. Four more radiocarbon dates
indicate that the burned rock midden itself was in use during the latter part of the Late Archaic (100 B.C.- A.D. 650),
the early part of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 790-1000), and the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D.
1280-1400). Charred plant remains recovered from 41VV1897 indicate, at minimum, the use of littleleaf walnut
during the Middle Archaic period; the use of prickly pear, sotol/yucca, and littleleaf walnut during the Late Archaic
period; and the use of sotol/yucca and littleleaf walnut during the Late Prehistoric period.

sample from 41VVl893 consisted of the debitage from
Units 8, 15, and 16 in Midden 1 (n = 260), Units 3, 4,
and 5 in Midden 2 (n = 274), and Unit 19 in Midden 3
(n = 308). The sample from 41VV1895 consisted of the
debitage from Unit 4b (n = 314). Finally, the sample
from 41VVl897 consisted of the debitage from Unit 4
(n = 343). This material was separated into size
categories using nested sieves (> 1 inch, 1-Yz inch,
Yz-~ inch, and ~-Ys inch). The additional variables
recorded for this material included type of debitage
(flake, chip, or potlid), raw material, platform type (hard
hammer, soft hammer, or undetermined), presence or
absence of cortex, and presence or absence of heating.
Appendix L presents the data on the debitage sample
from site 41VV1892; Appendix M presents the data for
site 41VV1893; Appendix N presents the data for site
41VV1895; and Appendix 0 presents the data for
41VV1897.

collected for subsequent analysis. Originally, it was
intended to reserve a portion of the soil samples for possible later matrix analysis, but when it was seen how
productive the flotation was in regard to plant remains, it
was decided to flote all of the remaining soil from the
four sites. The inventory of flotation remains recovered
from all four sites is presented in Appendix Q.
All of the charred plant remains recovered through
either dry screening or flotation from 41VV1892,
41VV1893, 41VV1895, and 41VV1897 were submitted
to the Archaeobotanical Laboratory of the Center for
Ecological Archaeology, Department of Anthropology,
Texas A&M University for identification by Dr. Phil
Dering. His report on this material is included as Appendix A.

Radiocarbon Dating
Following the analysis of the charred plant remains
from 41VV1892, 41VV1893, 41VV1895,
and
41VV1897, suitable charcoal samples were submitted for
radiocarbon dating. The selection of samples for dating
was guided by several considerations. Following Black
and Creel (1997:271), it was assumed that "both stray
and concentrated deposits" of charred plant remains
within a midden were very likely to be functionally and
temporally associated with the accumulation and use of
that midden. In order to increase the likelihood that this
assumption accurately reflected reality, a further effort
was made to select plant remains known or believed to
have been of economic importance to the prehistoric
inhabitants of the Lower Pecos region, such as
sotol/yucca, prickly pear, and walnut shell. Only when
the remains of putative economic plants were not available from a specific context were samples of wood used,
under the assumption that such remains represented fuel
used during cooking activities. This follows the recommendations of Black, Ellis, Creel, and Goode (1997).
Again following the recommendation of Black and
Creel (1997:272), and given the current belief that most
burned rock middens formed over a lengthy period of
time, four to five samples were selected from each midden from different internal contexts, including any identifiable features within the burned rock midden, midden
fill in the center of the burned rock midden (in the area
of the putative central cooking facility), midden fill on
the periphery of the burned rock midden (representing
remains dislodged from the center and discarded), the old
ground surface beneath the center of the midden (possibly representing the earliest use of the midden), and the
old ground surface at the periphery (possibly representing sometime in the middle of the midden's use-life).
Unfortunately, not every provenience could be sampled
in each midden, but most middens could be sampled in
the center and on the edges, or on the old ground surface.
A total of 26 charred plant samples were sent to

Midden and Burned Rock Analysis
The excavation notes, maps, profiles, and photomosaics for each midden at 41VV1892, 41VV1893,
41VV1895, and 41VV1897 were examined and the
physical characteristics of each midden tabulated. These
characteristics include estimated size, morphological
configuration, form in cross section, presence or absence
of central pit, presence or absence of evidence of heating
of the substrate beneath the midden, presence or absence
(and frequency) ofrocks that were thermally fractured in
place, stratigraphic context of the midden, proximity to
potential resources, and environmental location.
Observations of size and angularity of burned rocks
by provenience, made during excavation, were tabulated
for all proveniences within the burned rock middens at
41VV1892, 41VV1893, 41VV1895, and 41VV1897.
These data are contained in Appendix P. Using these
data, varying frequencies of burned rock size were
graphed, and comparative measures calculated for each
midden, including proportion of angularity vs. nonangularity and density of burned rocks per unit volume. Using
density of burned rocks per unit volume, along with
experimental observations on productivity and residue of
earth-oven processing of lechuguilla and sotol (Dering
1999:Table 4), it was possible to generate rough estimates of food energy yield and person-days of available
calories for comparative purposes.

Flotation and Analysis of Charred Plant
Remains
A column of soil samples collected from each midden at 41VV1892, 41VV1893, 41VV1895, and
41VV1897 was floted and the results sorted and tabulated. These samples were processed using a Flotc-Tech
flotation device, and all macrobotanical remains were

and five samples from 41VV1897 (Beta-168045, Beta168046, Beta-168047, Beta-168048, and Beta-168049).
Because of the small size of most of these samples (the
largest sample weighed 700 milligrams (mg), and the
smallest two weighed less than 100 mg, each), and again
following the recommendations of Black and Creel
(1997:272), all were dated using the AMS technique.
This means that all the dated samples from the four Dry
Devils River sites represent discrete samples, that is to
say "samples collected from one specific spot that should
represent a single event" (Black and Creel 1997:272).
The individual results of the radiocarbon analysis are
included as Appendix B and they are plotted visually for
all of the sites in Figure 58, in the final chapter.

Samples of both formal and informal tools recovered from the excavations at each site were examined for
lithic use-wear or polish, utilizing the low power
approach with microscopy generally ranging from 10x40x or less (Odell 1977, 1981). A total of 52 tools was
selected from the four sites (i.e., 13 specimens from
41VV1892, 13 from 41VV1893, 12 from 41VV1895,
and 14 from 41VV1897). The selection of tools to be
examined was designed to sample most of the tool types
present, with the exception of intact projectile points. An
emphasis was also placed on tools that were present in a
spatially discrete area that was not on or in proximity to
the ground surface. As a result of this analysis, some of
the tools were reclassified into other artifact categories
and a new tool type, modified flake, was introduced.
Attributes examined for this study included type,
size, and pattern of flake removals along the edge, edge
rounding, edge crushing, striae, and polish. The object of
the analysis was to identify the general direction of
motion and hardness of material that each tool was used
against. The study was conducted by Ms. Ruth Marie,
under the direction of the Principal Investigator, and the
results are presented in Appendix C.

CHAPTER VI: EXCAVATIONS AT SITE41VV1893

The distribution of the tools at Midden 3 suggests a concentric arrangement of activities (Figure 28). Unit 20,
one of the central units with a high density of burned
rocks, yielded no tools whatsoever. The units to the north
and south of Unit 20 contained various types of bifaces,
including one biface tool and one utilized biface from
Unit 19 and one biface tool and one failed biface from
Unit 21. The units closer to the edge of Midden 3 (with
the exception of Unit 23, which yielded no tools) yielded
both formal tools and expedient unifacial tools. These are
one utilized biface, one modified flake, and one utilized
flake from Unit 18 and one drill and one scraper from
Unit 22. Finally, on the eastern side of Trench 4, across
from Unit 21, Unit 24 contained a mixture of both formal
and expedient tools - one biface tool, two failed
bifaces, one modified flake, and one utilized flake.

Midden 2, all the units excavated along the trench
appeared to penetrate the burned rock midden. The horizontal distribution of burned rocks recorded in the excavation units at Midden 3 (Table 38) shows a similar
pattern to that revealed by the cut through Midden 2. The
two units that seem to be closest to the center of the midden (i.e., Units 20 and 21) show the highest density of
burned rocks (Figure 26). The fact that the density drops
and then rises again in both directions is curious, but it
may be a function of the fact the two end units (i.e.,
Units 18 and 23) had the smallest excavated volumes.

Subsequent to the analysis of the charred plant

were submitted for radiocarbon dating. As noted in
Chapter IV, the selection of samples for dating followed
the recommendations of Black and Creel (1997) and
Black, Ellis, Creel, and Goode (1997). Samples were
submitted for dating to Beta Analytic, Inc., of Miami,
Florida.

Midden 1

Four charred plant samples from Midden 1 at
41VV1893 were chosen for radiocarbon dating (Table 40
and Appendix B). Three of these samples were recovered
from Unit 11, in the central portion of Midden l, while
the fourth came from Unit 7, on the southeastern edge of
the midden 2 (see Figure 14). Of the three samples from
Unit 11, one (Beta-168038) came from what may be the
old ground surface beneath Midden 1 (Zone M-11), while
the other two (Beta-168036 and Beta-168037) came from
higher up in the burned rock midden (Zone M-1), probably from a ring of discarded rocks around a "centerfocused cooking facility." The final radiocarbon sample
(Beta-168035) came from the old ground surface on the
midden periphery (Figure 29). All of these samples date
to the early part of the Middle Archaic period (40001000 B.C.), within about 600 years of each other
(Turpin's Eagle Nest subperiod).
The earliest date, 2890 (2900) 2910 B.C., comes
from the old ground surface on the periphery of the midden, while the three dates from the center of the midden
all cluster close together in time. From top to bottom,
these are 2330 (2450) 2470 B.C., 2280 (2310) 2430 B.C.,
and 2460 (2480) 2560 B.C. It should be noted that the
two upper dates are almost identical at the 2-sigma confidence level (2460-2200 B.C. and 2480-2290 B.C.).
Under the "center-focused cooking facility" model, the

Once again, the distribution of the chipped stone
debitage from Midden 3 differs from that of the burned
rocks in a number of ways (Table 39). Although there is
a high density of debitage in Unit 21, overlapping somewhat with the highest density of burned rocks in Units 20
and 21, the greatest density of debitage is found closer to
the southern edge of the midden, in Units 18 and 19
(Figure 27). Here, debitage densities of over 2,000 pieces
per cubic meter are reached. North of Unit 21, in Units
22 and 23, the density of debitage decreases just as the
density of burned rocks does. The contrast between what
is happening on the northern edge, in comparison to the
southern edge is striking, and is probably related to the
topography of the site. With Midden 3 placed where it is,
on the edge of a slope about a ravine, it stands to reason
that more activities would be located on the more level,
upslope edge of the midden than on the downslope side.
Eighteen chipped stone tools were recovered from
Midden 3, although only 14 came from excavated context. Thirteen of the 18 are bifacial tools (72.2 percent).

youngest dates are expected to occur in the center of the
burned rock midden and to represent the most recent useepisodes, while the material on the periphery would represent the residue of earlier use-episodes. In this case, the
peripheral sample from the old ground surface may date
the initial construction episode of Midden 1. These dates
strongly suggest that Midden 1 at 41VV1893 was constructed and used during the early part of the Middle
Archaic period (the Eagle Nest subperiod), between
approximately 2910 and 2280 B.C.

1000-1600). Whether all of these occupations were
accompanied by burned rock midden construction is not
certain.
The earliest dates from Midden 2 come from the
old ground surface in the center of the profile, 2900
(2920) 3010 B.C., and from the midden fill above it, 2580
(2600) 2850 B.C. Both of these dates are on walnut shell
and are believed to be associated with the construction
and use of Midden 2. This range is very similar to the 1sigma date range for Midden 1 (2280-2910 B.C.), and
suggests that the two burned rock middens were at least
partially contemporary during the Middle Archaic period
(Eagle Nest subperiod). A more recent date, A.D. 550
(600) 630, comes from the old ground surface beyond
the edge of Midden 2 to the north, suggesting an occupation during the Late Archaic period (Blue Hills subperiod). This date is on juniper/cedar wood and does not
necessarily indicate the use of Midden 2 for cooking
activities, but a Late Archaic presence in the same location as Midden 2 is probably not coincidental. The
youngest date from Midden 2, A.D. 1020 (1040) 1160,
comes from the midden fill near the very edge of Midden
2. This date is also on juniper/cedar wood, but its location at the edge of the midden strongly suggests that the
final use of Midden 2 occurred during the Late Prehistoric period (Flecha subperiod).

Midden2
Four charred plant samples were also chosen for
radiocarbon dating from Midden 2 at 41VV1893 (Table
41 and Appendix B). Two of these came from Unit 2, in
the center of the exposed profile of Midden 2; one came
from Unit 4, apparently near the northern periphery of
the midden; and the final one came from Unit 6, beyond
the limits of the midden to the north (see Figure 14). It is
important to remember that the center of Midden 2 was
not penetrated by these excavations, so even the samples
from the approximate center of the exposed profile
probably came from near the edge of the midden. Of the
two samples from Unit 2, one (Beta-168040) came from
the top of the old ground surface beneath the midden
(Zone II), while the other one (Beta-168039) came from
higher up in Midden 2 (Zone M-1), possibly from the
ring of discarded rocks around a hypothetical "centerfocused cooking facility" that was outside the TxDOT
ROW to the west. The third radiocarbon sample (Beta168033) came from near the base of Zone M-I near the
edge of the midden, while the fourth sample (Beta168034) probably came from near the top of the old
ground surface (Zone II) beyond the edge of the midden
(Figure 30). The dates given by these samples cover a
wide range of time and suggest that Midden 2, and the
area around it, may have been in use intermittently from
the early part of the Middle Archaic period (4000-1000
B.C.), to the early part of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D.

Midden3
Finally, four charred plant samples were submitted
for radiocarbon dating from Midden 3 at 41VV1893
(Table 42 and Appendix B). All four of these samples
came from Unit 21, in the center of the exposed profile
of Midden 3 (see Figure 14). As with Midden 2, the
center of Midden 3 was not penetrated by these excavations, so none of the dated samples came from the hypothetical "center-focused cooking facility" that was
probably outside the TxDOT ROW to the west. All of
the dated samples consisted of economic plant remains
(i.e., walnut shells and sotol/yucca fibers) from midden

fill, and are believed to be associated with the construction and use of Midden 3 at various times. Three of the
samples (Beta-168030, Beta-168031, and Beta-168032)
came from separate levels within the lower midden zone
(Zone M-lb), while the fourth (Beta-168029) came from
one level within the upper midden zone (Zone M-la).
Presumably all of these samples came from the ring of
discarded rocks around a hypothetical "center-focused
cooking facility" to the west (Figure 31 ). The two middle
dates (Beta-168030 and Beta-168031) are in reversed
stratigraphic sequence, suggesting some disturbance and
bioturbation, but otherwise the four dates seem to provide a reasonable temporal model for at least the early
part of the history of Midden 3. As was the case with
Midden 2, these samples cover a moderate range of time
and suggest that the lower part of Midden 3 (Zone M-Ib)
may have accumulated during the Middle Archaic period
(4000-1000 B.c.), while the upper part of Midden 3
(Zone M-Ia) may have accumulated during the Late
Archaic period (1000 B.C.- A.D. 1000), and possibly
later.

comes from near the bottom of the midden fill
(Zone M-Ib, 90-100 cmbs), and suggests that the initial
construction and use of Midden 3 occurred during the
early part of the Middle Archaic period (Eagle Nest subperiod). This range overlaps somewhat with the 1-sigma
date range for Midden 1 (2280-2910 B.C.), and suggests
that the two burned rock middens were at least partially
contemporary during the Middle Archaic period (Eagle
Nest subperiod). In contrast, the I-sigma range for Midden 2 during this period (2580-3010 B.C.) shows no
overlap with Midden 3, suggesting that there was little or
no contemporaneity in the use of these two features. The
latter part of the Middle Archaic period (San Felipe subperiod) is represented by a single sample from higher up
in Zone M-Ib (60-70 cmbs), with a date of 1690 (1740)
1760 B.C. This date suggests that Midden 3 continued to
be used when the other two middens at 41VV1893 were
not. As noted above, the distribution of Rabdotus shells
from Units 21 and 22 suggests that there may have been
a hiatus in midden deposition at about 80 cmbs in Zone
M-Ib, a view that seems to be supported by the radiocarbon dates.

DATA RECOVERY OF FOUR SITES, VAL VERDE COUNTY

The final two dates from Midden 3 indicate that the
feature continued to accumulate during the early part of
the Late Archaic period (Cibola subperiod). The earliest
of these two, 1000 (1040) 1120 B.C., came from Zone
M-Ib (70-80 cmbs) and may be out of stratigraphic
order. The other date, 920 (970) 1010 B.C., came from
the base of Zone M-Ia (40-50 cmbs) and suggests that
the upper zone in Midden 3 may date to the Late Archaic
period. The fact that the most recent date from Midden 3
came from 40-50 cmbs strongly suggests that Midden 3
continued in use later than the Cibola subperiod, and was
possibly in use during the Blue Hills and Flecha subperiods, as was Midden 2.

Dart Point Fragment
One unidentified dart point fragment was recovered
from Midden 1 at 41VV1893 (see Appendix I). This
specimen consists of the distal end of what appears to
have been a very well made dart point with straight blade
edges (Figure 32). The extant fragment measures
32.63 mm long, 16.12 mm wide, and 3.7 mm thick. It
weighs 1.6 g. It was recovered from Zone M-I (30-40
cmbs) in Unit 11, in the central area of the midden.
Although it cannot be identified as to type, it resembles
the distal end of a well-made Val Verde point recovered
from 41VVl897, to the south.

Bifaces and Biface Fragments
Of the 17 bifaces recovered from 4VV1893, 6 are
complete and 11 are fragmentary (see Appendix J). Four
were recovered from Midden 1, 1 from Midden 2, and
the remaining 12 were from Midden 3. Of the four
specimens from Midden 1, one is a biface tool, one is a
distal biface tool fragment, one is a proximal failed
biface fragment, and one is a utilized biface fragment.
The failed biface fragment was recovered from 30-40
cmbs in Unit 9, and the biface tool was recovered from
50-60 cmbs in the same unit. The utilized biface fragment and the biface tool fragment were both recovered
from 20-30 cmbs in Unit 11. Both of these units were
located in the central part of the midden and all of the
bifaces were recovered from Zone M-1. The biface tool
from Midden 1 measures 64.62 mm long, 44.83 mm
wide, 17 .12 mm thick, and weighs 43 g. The biface tool
fragment measures 42.8 mm long, 23.29 mm wide,
6.78 mm thick, and weighs 4.6 g. The failed biface
fragment measures 47.34 mm long, 69.88 mm wide,
9.4 mm thick, and weighs 35.2 g. The utilized biface
fragment is 32.56 mm long, 19.19 mm wide, and
8.72 mm thick. It weighs 5.8 g.
The single specimen from Midden 2 consists of a
failed biface fragment from Zone I (10-20 cmbs) in
Unit 6, beyond the edge of the midden to the north. This
failed biface fragment measures 66.31 mm long,
34.75 mm wide, and 9.69 mm thick. It weighs 26.l g.
Finally, the 12 specimens from Midden 3 consist of
five biface tools or tool fragments, five utilized biface
fragments, and two failed bifaces. Biface tools were
recovered from Zone M-Ia (0-10 cmbs) in Unit 19 and
from general surface context within Trench 4 (n = 2),
while biface tool fragments were recovered from Zone
M-Ia (10-20 cmbs) in both Unit 21 and Unit 24. The five
utilized biface fragments from Midden 3 were recovered

burned rocks, lithic debitage, and unwanted tools were

flakes, 2 utilized bifaces, 11 utilized flakes, and 2 failed
bifaces. The two dart points and one failed biface were
recovered from the surface of the site and are of no further concern here. The distribution of the other tools fails
to show any clear patterns (Figure 41). Units 1, 3, and 4
all have a higher frequency of tools in comparison to
Units 2 and 5. It has already been noted that the distribution of burned rocks and debitage suggests that the
southeastern portion of the site represents secondary
deposition. This would include Units 2 and 4, and possibly Unit 3. Unit 1 is outside the burned rock scatter at
41VV1895, and the tools from this unit may represent
material left in an actual use area. Unit 5 may also represent material left at or near an actual use area, although it
is located within the burned rock scatter, as presently
defined.
Based on the distribution of burned rocks, lithic
debitage, and stone tools, the north central portion of the
burned rock scatter at 41VV1895 may have contained
one or more "center-focused cooking facilities" (presumably hearths or shallow earth/rock ovens). Habitation
or activity areas were possibly located to the north and

Subsequent to the analysis of the charred plant
remains recovered from 41VV1895, charcoal samples
were submitted for radiocarbon dating to Beta Analytic,
Inc., of Miami, Florida. As noted in Chapter IV, the
selection of samples for dating followed the recommendations of Black and Creel (1997) and Black, Ellis,
Creel, and Goode (1997).
Four charred plant samples were submitted for
radiocarbon dating from the burned rock scatter at
41VV1895 (Table 63 and Appendix B). Two of these
samples were recovered from Unit lb in the northern
portion of Trench 1, beyond the apparent limit of the
burned rock scatter, while the other two samples came
from Units 2b and 3, in the eastern and central portions
of the burned rock scatter, respectively (see Figure 35).
Although both of the samples from Unit lb came from
Zone I, one (Beta-168042) came from near the old
ground surface (30-40 cmbs) while the other (Beta168041) came from near the present ground surface (1020 cmbs). The dates were stratigraphically reversed,
probably due to bioturbation (Figure 42). The other two
samples both came from midden fill (Zone M-I). The
sample from Unit 2b (Beta-168043) came from near the
eastern edge of the burned rock scatter, while the sample
from Unit 3 came from near the center. Since the burned
rock feature at 41VVl895 was more of a scatter and not
so much a mounded midden, no single "center-focused
cooking facility" was identified, and it is possible that
none exists. Thus, all of the dated samples from
41VV1895 may simply represent the nonstructural residue of earth/rock oven cooking in a number of locations.
Two of the dated samples consisted of the remains of
economic plants, presumably directed related to this
activity.
All four samples from 41VV1895 date to the Late
Prehistoric period (A.D. 1000-1600), although the temporal spread of the dates suggests multiple use-episodes
during that period. The upper sample from Unit lb dates
to A.D. 1230 (1260) 1280, and is very close to the date
from Unit 3 in the center of the midden, A.D. 1200 (1240)
1270. Indeed, these dates are almost identical at the
2-sigma range (see Appendix B). The date from Unit 2b,
A.D. 1320 (1400) 1420, is slightly later in time and does
not overlap with the previous two dates at the 2-sigma
level, suggesting a separate use-episode. Finally,
although the date on the lower sample from Unit lb, A.D.
1420 (1430) 1440, does overlap slightly with the date
from Unit 2b at the 2-sigma level, it may still date a third

(Peck 1991:70, Figure 3.ln) have been taken as index
markers of the Blue Hills subperiod (2300-1300 B.P.)
(Turpin 1991:34, 1995:549). Val Verde points, on the
other hand, are considered to be index markers for the
San Felipe subperiod (4100-3200 B.P.).

CHIPPED STONE ARTIFACTS
The investigations at 41VV1895 resulted in the
recovery of 1,658 lithic artifacts, including 2 dart points
or point fragments, 7 bifaces or biface fragments, 8 deliberately modified flakes, 11 utilized flakes, and 1,630
pieces of lithic debitage (see Appendix G). All of this
material was made on locally available chert.

Dart Points and Point Fragments
Of the two dart points or point fragments recovered
from 41VV1895, both are identifiable as to type (see
Appendix I). A complete dart point is typed as an Ellis
(Figure 43a), while a dart point fragment is typed as a
Val Verde (Figure 43b). Turner and Hester (1993:113)
note that Ellis points are widespread throughout eastern,
southern, and central Texas, and they date them in general from the Middle to Transitional Archaic (ca. 40001400 B.P.). Val Verde points, on the other hand, are
reported to be largely confined to the Lower Pecos, the
lower Rio Grande, and Coahuila, Mexico, and are dated
to the Middle Archaic (ca. 4500-3000 B.P.) (Turner and
Hester 1993:192). In the Lower Pecos region, specifically, Ellis points are reported from Fate Bell Shelter
(Sum and Jelks 1962:187-188), although a more recent
analysis of the projectile points from this site apparently
failed to identify them (Peck 1991). While Ellis points
are not identified as index markers for any particular
period in the Lower Pecos region (Hester 1989b; Turpin
1991, 1995), similar triangular-bladed points with expanding stems, such as Ensor points at Eagle Cave (Ross
1965:45, Figure 10 0-T) and Arenosa Shelter (Dibble
1967:34, Fig. 15a-i), and Form 14 at Fate Bell Shelter

The standard dating for these two point types does
not agree with the date of occupation of 41VV1895, as
given by the four radiocarbon dates from the site (see
Table 63). These strongly point toward a Late Prehistoric
occupation, specifically after A.D. 1200. Apparently, the
occupants of 41VV1895 were reusing earlier projectile
points scavenged from other sites, probably as knives.
The distal end of the Val Verde point is broken off,
leaving only the base intact. The extant specimen measures 24.04 mm long, 20.26 mm wide, and 7 .11 mm thick.
It weighs 3.4 g. The point was recovered from Trench 2

tage (n = 41) was also recovered from the level of Feature 1 in Units 7, 7a, and 7b, as well as one backed blade
and one graver/scraper. In addition, one scraper and two
utilized flakes were recovered from the levels above
Feature 1 in Unit 7 (20-40 cmbs), one Val Verde point
fragment was recovered from below the level of Feature
1 in Unit 7b (50--60 cmbs), and a second Val Verde point
fragment was recovered by flotation from the 10 cm
above the level of Feature 1 in Unit 7c (40-50 cmbs).
The level of Feature 1 in Unit 7 also yielded .6 g of charcoal and 1.6 g of Rabdotus shell (n = 4) from screening.
Flotation samples were processed from Feature 1 and are
discussed in the following sections.

Tabulations for Unit 7 include tools from Units 7a, 7b, and 7c.

The small sample of tools recovered from Zone II
at 41VVl897 is concentrated north of the midden, in the
same area previously identified as having the highest
density of debitage in Zone II (Figure 52). This provides
additional support for the view that at least some of the
material from Zone II represents pre-midden activity at
41VV1897. The relatively large number of cores in this
area points toward primary lithic reduction being of
some importance for this occupation, but little else of
any interest can be suggested at this time.

RADIOCARBON DATING
Subsequent to the analysis of the charred plant
remains recovered from 41VV1897, charcoal samples
were submitted for radiocarbon dating to Beta Analytic,
Inc., of Miami, Florida. As noted in Chapter IV, the
selection of samples for dating followed the recommendations of Black and Creel (1997) and Black, Ellis,
Creel, and Goode (1997).
Five charred plant samples were submitted for
radiocarbon dating from the burned rock midden at
41VV1897 (Table 79 and Appendix B). Two of these
came from Unit 8, in the approximate center of the profile of the burned rock midden; one came from Unit 5,
near the northern periphery of the midden; one came
from Unit 2, beyond the limits of the midden to the
north; and the final one came from the fill of Feature 1 in
Units 7-7a, close to the center of the profile of the midden (see Figure 46). Of the two samples from Unit 8, one
(Beta-168049) came from below the top of the old
ground surface beneath the midden (Zone II), while the
other (Beta-168048) came from the fill of the midden
itself (Zone M-1), possibly from a deposit of discarded
rocks between several "center-focused cooking facilities"
to the north and south. The radiocarbon sample from
Feature 1 in Units 7-7a (Beta-168047) probably comes
from one such "center-focused cooking facility." The
fourth radiocarbon sample (Beta-168045) came from
near the base of Zone M-1 at the edge of the midden,
while the fifth and final sample (Beta-168046) came
from Zone I, near the top of the old ground surface,
beyond the edge of the midden (Figure 56). The dates
given by these samples cover a wide range of time and
suggest that 41VV1897 was probably occupied intermittently from the latter part of the Middle Archaic
period (4000-1000 B.C.) to the Late Prehistoric period
(A.D. 1000-1600).
The earliest date from 41VV1897 comes from the
old ground surface beneath the approximate center of the
burned rock midden. This date, 1940 (2010) 2140 B.C., is
believed to be associated with a Middle Archaic period
(San Felipe subperiod) occupation at the site. Based on

FEATUREl
Feature 1 at 41VV1897 was the only cooking facility identified at the Dry Devils River sites. The fact that
it occurs in a location predicted for a "center-focused
cooking facility" based on the distribution of burned
rocks within the midden lends support to interpretations
that identify similar possible facilities at other sites in the
area. Feature 1 is believed to probably be a portion of the
base of an earth/rock oven, largely destroyed by subsequent redigging.
Feature 1 was initially identified in the Trench 1
profile as several flat rocks, measuring about 25 cm
across and about 40 cmbs (Figure 53). Subsequent excavation of Unit 7 showed Feature 1 to be a layer of flat,
heat-cracked angular rocks, between 40 and 50 cmbs
(Figure 54). Additional 50-x-50-cm units were opened to
the north, south, and east of Unit 7 (designated Units 7a,
7b, and 7c, respectively) in order to clear more of this
feature. Feature 1 was found to extend into Unit 7a, to
the north, and Unit 7b, to the south (Figure 55), but not
into Unit 7c, to the east. It measured approximately 100110 cm north-south by about 50-55 cm east-west, running parallel to Trench 1. Although Feature 1 was present in Unit 7 at a depth of 40-50 cmbs, it was identified
in both Units 7a and 7b at 30-40 cmbs, implying that it
was roughly basin shaped. Thirteen angular rocks,
weighing 3 kg, made up Feature 1 in Unit 7. An additional 16 angular rocks (4 kg) and 11 subrounded rocks
(6 kg) were removed from the Feature 1 level in Unit 7a,
while 27 angular rocks (9.5 kg) and 13 subrounded rocks
(7 kg) came from Unit 7b. A moderate amount of debi-

Comments

burned rocks from the "center-focused cooking facility"
were discarded on the edge of the midden, while the second sample is believed to date activities associated with
the use of the midden beyond its limits. One of these
dates is on acacia wood, while the other is on a sotoV
yucca fiber bundle, strongly supporting its association
with the deposition of the burned rock midden.
The two final dates from the burned rock midden
are believed to document continued use of the earth/rock
oven cooking during the Late Prehistoric period (Flecha
subperiod). The upper sample from Unit 8, from Zone
M-I and possibly associated with discarded burned rocks
from one or more "center-focused cooking facilities"
near the center of the midden, yielded a date of A.D. 880
(900) 980, while the sample from Feature 1, the remnant
of a disturbed earth/rock oven in the center of the midden, yielded a date of A.D. 1290 (1300) 1390. The fact
that Feature 1 was disturbed, probably by subsequent
cooking events, indicates that the midden at 41VV1897
continued in use past the mid-thirteen century, possibly
into the early fourteenth century. Both of these dates are
on sotoVyucca fiber bundles, indicating the continued
use and deposition of the burned rock midden during this
period.

present data, this occupation seems to predate the initial
construction and use of the burned rock midden at
41VV1897, but it could alternatively represent activity
associated with a "center-focused cooking facility" farther to the east, outside of the TxDOT ROW, and thus
uninvestigated. The date is on walnut shell, which elsewhere has been argued to be associated with earth/rock
oven cooking and food preparation.
It is worth mentioning at this point that five dart
points or dart point fragments were recovered from
41VVl897, and that four of these have been identified as
Val Verde points, of Middle Archaic date. Of these four
Val Verde points, three were recovered near the base of
Zone M-I, and one was recovered from the first level of
Zone II below Zone M-I.
Several dates from the Late Archaic period (Blue
Hills subperiod) suggest that the burned rock midden at
the site was under construction by that time. The sample
from Unit 5, at the base of Zone M-I near the edge of the
midden, yielded a date of 50 B.C. (10 B.C.) A.D. 40, while
the sample from Unit 2, from Zone I near the top of the
old ground surface beyond the edge of the midden,
yielded a date of A.D. 540 (580) 620. The first sample is
believed to date the early growth of the midden as

applied to the entire Lower Pecos region, with some
variation (see, for example, Bement 1989 and Hester
1989b), although, in truth, it is not known how widely
this chronology of cultural phases and subperiods can be
applied to the rest of the Lower Pecos region.
A series of 26 radiocarbon dates was run on charred
plant remains recovered from the six burned rock midden
locations at the Dry Devils River sites. In accordance
with the recommendations of Black, Creel, and Ellis
(1997:308), four to five samples of charred plant remains
were submitted from each midden for AMS dating.
Eighteen of these samples (69.2 percent) consisted of
what were believed to be economic plants, that is, plants
important as food resources and possibly prepared in the
burned rock middens. These included nutshells of the
littleleaf walnut (n = 8), sotol/yucca fiber bundles
(n = 9), and prickly pear pad fragments (n = 1). The
remaining 8 samples (30.8 percent) consisted of the
remains of wood, presumably used as fuel in the cooking
process, either in the middens or outside them. These
included acacia (n =I), juniper/cedar (n = 6), and mesquite (n = 1). The samples were relatively evenly distributed among the six middens from the four sites,
including five samples from the single midden at
41VV1892, four samples from Midden 1 at 41VV1893,
four samples from Midden 2 at 41VV1893, four samples
from Midden 3 at 41VVl893, four samples from the
incipient midden or scatter at 41VVl895, and five samples from the single midden at 41VVl897. Discussions
of the suite from each site have been presented in the
previous chapters, and what follows is a discussion of the
four sites as a whole.
Based on the radiocarbon dates, the Dry Devils
River sites were occupied periodically from the middle
of the Middle Archaic period (4000-1000 B.C.) until late
in the Late Prehistoric period A.D. I 000-1600). While
the sites appear to have been occupied periodically, the
dates also suggest that these periodic episodes of use
were clustered and that there was a variation of periodic
use between sites. The distribution of the 26 AMS dates
is presented in Figure 58. For the sake of comparability,
this figure is based on Figure 136 presented in Black,
Ellis, Creel, and Goode (1997). As with the latter figure,
the dates from each of the Dry Devils River middens are
enclosed by dashed line boxes. Each date is depicted as a
horizontal bar showing its intercept with the tree-ringcalibration curve and its 1- and 2-sigma calibrated age
estimates (see Appendix B). The dashed vertical lines
mark the boundaries between the Middle and Late

This chapter is intended to serve as a summary of
the archeological data recovery conducted at the four
Dry Devils River sites, 41VV1892, 41VV1893,
41VV1895, and 41VVl897. The following discussion
refers back to the Research Design, Historic Contexts,
and Study Units presented in Chapter IV. The questions
discussed separately below follow from the critical
research questions posed by Black, Creel, and Ellis
(1997) at the end of Hot Rock Cooking on the Greater
Edwards Plateau: Four Burned Rock Midden Sites in
West Central Texas (Black, Ellis, Creel, and Goode
1997).

Unfortunately, due to the excavation strategy pursued at the Dry Devil River sites, with an explicit concentration on investigations of the middens at the
expense of "the overall site contexts within which
middens occur," our ability to shed light on the first three
questions is significantly greater than it is for the last
three questions. Each topic is discussed individually
below.
WHEN DID THE DRY DEVU,S RIVER
MIDDENS ACCUMULATE?

As noted in Chapter IV, one of the goals of the proposed research at the four Dry Devils River sites was to
attempt to refine our understanding of the prehistoric
cultural affiliations and the chronological sequence for
the eastern edge of the Lower Pecos region. Turpin's
division of the traditional four-period system (i.e.,
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic) into
10 subperiods and 1 phase (Aurora, Bonfire, Oriente,
Viejo, Eagle Nest, San Felipe, Cibola, Flanders, Blue
Hills, Flecha, and Infiemo) is presented in Chapter III.
Each of these divisions is associated with a series of
projectile point types that Turpin feels is characteristic of

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

linked in some fashion to other changes that Turpin sees
going on farther south?
As noted in Chapter III, the Eagle Nest subperiod
supposedly coincides with the height of an extremely
hot, dry period, and is characterized by an increasing
reliance on desert vegetation and fauna. Brown
(1991:123) suggests there was a shift to labor-intensive
processing of sotol and yucca at Baker Cave around 3000
B.C. as a "least-risk response to mid-Holocene environmental deterioration," and that this is evidence of
increased diet breadth, with associated increases in group
mobility, community size, and territoriality. Certainly,
the initial and intensive construction of burned rock middens in the Dry Devils River area after about 3100 B.C. is
in agreement with this point of view. Turpin ( 199 5: 54 7)
suggests that there were several changes in settlement
pattern during the San Felipe subperiod, all linked to the
subsistence economy. First, there may have been a shift
in population toward riverine locations caused by a
dwindling of upland water resources. Second, there may
have been an increase in the number of task-oriented
upland sites involved in the exploitation of upland
resources, at the expense of upland foraging sites occupied by entire bands. The archeological effect that these
suggested changes would have had in the Dry Devils
River area is unclear. An increased occupation in riverine
locations closer to the Rio Grande would not be visible
in this area, and differentiating between "band-occupied"
vs. "task-group-occupied" sites would be difficult. Nevertheless, the data from the Dry Devils River sites do
suggest that changes in settlement pattern were occurring. Perhaps the most significant observation is the
apparent decrease in burned rock middens utilized during
the Middle Archaic period, from three active middens
prior to 2000 B.C. (Middens l, 2, and 3 at 41VVl893), to
one subsequent to 2000 B.C. (Midden 3 at 41VV1893).
This, in itself, seems to indicate a decrease in the exploitation of upland resources in this area during the San
Felipe subperiod.
During the early part of the Late Archaic period,
from about 900 B.C. to about 100 B.C., there is no radiocarbon evidence for burned rock use at any of the Dry
Devils River sites (see Figure 58). This takes up a large
part of Turpin's Cibola subperiod (1200-350 B.C.),
which is supposed to have coincided with a short mesic
interlude during which bison apparently extended their
range southward into the Lower Pecos region. It is possible that the lack of burned rock midden dates from the
Dry Devils River area for this time period is due to these
environmental conditions - conditions that resulted in a
decreased reliance on desert succulents, and the cooking
facilities used to prepare them.
Apparently, this changed after about 100 B.C. The
initial use of the burned rock midden at 41VV1897
apparently came between about 100 B.C. and A.D. 100,
with subsequent reuse between A.D. 450 and 650. The

Archaic periods (1000 B.C.) and between the Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (A.D. 1000).
It is not certain why there was no evidence at the
Dry Devils River sites of any occupation earlier than the
Middle Archaic, but it is possible that upland areas such
as this were not extensively utilized until after the Early
Archaic. It has already been noted that the Early Archaic
period in the Lower Pecos region (7000-4000 B.C.) witnessed the appearance of the full range of Archaic traits
in the rockshelters in the region, including Eagle Cave,
Hinds Cave, and Baker Cave. The deeply stratified Devils Mouth site, at the confluence of the Devils River and
the Rio Grande, was also in use during the Early
Archaic. However, upland survey in the vicinity of Hinds
Cave failed to record any evidence of Early Archaic
utilization, leading Saunders (1986) to suggest that the
more remote upland areas were not used as frequently at
this time as they were in the later periods. It is also possible that burned rock middens did not become a common technology in these upland areas until after the
Early Archaic. A compilation of 141 radiocarbon dates
from 35 burned rock middens in central Texas shows that
all but one date subsequent to 3500 B.C. (Black and Creel
1997:Figure 136). It should also be noted that several of
these sites seem to mirror the occupation histories of the
Dry Devils River sites.
Radiocarbon evidence for Middle Archaic midden
construction can be seen at all three middens at
41VV1893, and Middens 1and2 may be penecontemporaneous (a geological term meaning nearly or apparently
contemporaneous) between about 2950 and 2850 B.C.
and between about 2600 and 2450 B.C., while Middens 2
and 3 may be penecontemporaneous between about 2500
and 2200 B.C. (see Figure 58). After 2200 B.C., Midden 3
apparently continued to be used periodically until the end
of the Middle Archaic, and possibly even into the early
part of the Late Archaic, until about 900 B.C. The only
radiocarbon evidence for Middle Archaic occupation at
any other Dry Devils River site comes from 41VV1897,
where one date falls between about 2150 and 1900 B.C.
As noted previously, there is a moderate amount of evidence suggesting that this occupation may not have been
associated with burned rock midden construction, and it
is somewhat intriguing that it falls in a gap of about 300
years or so (i.e., 2200-1900 B.C.) following what is
arguably a period of intensive midden construction at
41VV1893 and preceding the renewal of midden construction at Midden 3 at that site. This interval coincides
with the end of Turpin's Eagle Nest subperiod (ca. 35502150 B.C.) and the beginning of her San Felipe subperiod
(2150-1250 B.C.). Assuming that there is a real decline
in the use of burned rock middens at this time, and that
the presence of a non-burned rock midden occupation is
indicative of a change in settlement systems and not simply sampling error (both of which are barely justifiable,
admittedly), then it begs the question, are these changes
157

markers for the San Felipe subperiod (2150-1250 B.C.)
by Turpin. It should also be noted that the dart point
fragment from Midden 1 at 41VVl893 is very well made
and resembles the distal end of a Val Verde point. As
noted above, the Middle Archaic occupation at
41VV1897 may not have involved the construction and
use of a burned rock midden, and it does appear to have
been during the San Felipe subperiod. Thus, it is probably no coincidence that four of the six Val Verde points
recovered by the project came from 41VV1897. Unfortunately, three of these four came from levels within the
burned rock midden, suggesting curation and use of earlier projectile points by later peoples, possibly as knives,
or use of earlier cultural deposits to cap later earth ovens,
as suggested by Leach and Bousman (2001). Although
the radiocarbon dates from Midden 1 at 41VVl893 show
it to have been in use during the Middle Archaic, this use
seems to have ended prior to the San Felipe subperiod,
and there is no apparent later reuse to account for curated
later tools on the site. Midden 3, however, was in use
during the San Felipe subperiod and ifthe point fragment
on Midden 1 is a Val Verde point, then it could be associated with that occupation. Alternatively, Midden 1
could have lasted a little longer than the radiocarbon
dates suggest or the point fragment may not belong to a
Val Verde point at all. The final Val Verde point was
recovered from 41VV1895, a site that seems to be firmly
dated to the Late Prehistoric period (see Figure 58). This
point is almost certainly an example of curation and
reuse of an earlier point by Late Prehistoric peoples, and
suggests the possibility that the reuse of the Val Verde
points at 41VV1897 may also date to the Late Prehistoric
period (especially since one Val Verde point was recovered from the Late Prehistoric Feature 1). Before leaving
the Middle Archaic, it should be noted that no Pandale
dart points, reputedly diagnostic of the Eagle Nest subperiod, were recovered from any middens with dates falling in the Eagle Nest subperiod (i.e., Midden 1, Midden
2, and Midden 3 at 41VV1893).
Late Archaic presence at the Dry Devils River sites
is indicated by the recovery of Fairland and Ensor points
at 41VV1892 and by an Ellis point at 41VV1895. Ensor
points are characteristic of the Blue Hills subperiod (350
B.C.-A.D. 650) in the Lower Pecos region; and, while
Fairland and Ellis points are not considered index markers for any subperiod in the region, they generally date to
the Late Archaic in adjacent areas. As noted above, there
is no radiocarbon evidence for occupation at any of the
Dry Devils River sites during the Cibola subperiod
(1,200-350 B.C.), and the apparent absence of Montell,
Castroville, and Marshall dart points from the area agrees
with this. Occupation during the Blue Hills subperiod is
supported by both radiocarbon dates and projectile
points, although not all of the points reputed to be diagnostic of this subperiod were recovered. In addition to
Ensor points, these include Frio, Figueroa, and Paisano

apparent initial utilization of 41VV1892 came between
A.D. 250 and 620, and Midden 2 at 41VV1893 was
apparently reutilized between A.D. 530 and 650 (see Figure 58). This period is analogous to Turpin's Blue Hills
subperiod (350 B.C.-A.D. 650) and reportedly witnessed
an intensification of the traditional "desert life-style" of
the earlier subperiods (see Chapter III). Certainly, the
radiocarbon dating of the Dry Devils River sites supports
a return to the use of burned rock middens in the
uplands, and a return to the utilization of the desert succulents that they were presumably used to prepare.
Additional radiocarbon dates indicate that the midden at 41VV1897 was in use between A.D. 780 and 1000
and between A.D. 1280 and 1400, the midden at
41VV1892 was in use between A.D. 780 and 1190, and
Midden 2 at 41VV1893 was in use between A.D. 1010
and 1180. Finally, all four of the radiocarbon dates from
41VV1895 indicate that the site was in use between A.D.
1170 and 1460 (see Figure 58). This period is equivalent
to Turpin's Flecha subperiod (A.D. 630-1500), most
notable for the introduction of the bow-and-arrow into
the Lower Pecos region. Turpin and her colleagues
apparently do not associate the Flecha subperiod with
any great changes in subsistence economy, although they
do note the obvious changes in projectile points and possible changes in mortuary customs and pictograph styles
(see Chapter III). They do suggest that there may have
been a preference for upland settlement at this time, and
that "the attributes of this phase reflect considerable
cultural mobility, most probably effected by the movements of people rather than diffusion" (Turpin and
Bement 1985:10). In any event, there is implied continuity in regard to upland burned rock middens and the
exploitation of desert succulents, continuity that is supported by the dates from the Dry Devils River sites. All
of the sites in use after 100 B.C. seem to show intermittent utilization, with no significant breaks, right up to the
end of the Late Prehistoric period.
The data recovery excavations at the four Dry Devils River sites provided a small sample of diagnostic
projectile points. In fact, the sample of points recovered
from these sites consists of six specimens from
41VV1892, one from 41VV1893, two from 41VV1895,
and six from 41VV1897 (see Appendix I). About twothirds of these provide worthwhile chronological data of
some sort. At the regional level, the projectile point data
agree generally with the radiocarbon dates. That is to
say, the projectile points from these four sites indicate
prehistoric utilization of the Dry Devils River area during the Middle Archaic, the Late Archaic, and the Late
Prehistoric periods. Unfortunately, at the site level, the
correspondences between the projectile points and the
radiocarbon dates are less satisfactory.
Middle Archaic utilization is suggested by the presence of Val Verde dart points at 41VV1895 and
41VV1897. These points are considered to be index
158

CHAPTER IX:

points, none of which were found. The presence of Fairland and Ellis points, in contrast, suggests cultural relationships to the east, instead of to the south. The Fairland
and the Ensor dart points are both from 41VV1892,
where two radiocarbon dates point to a Late Archaic
occupation between about A.D. 200 and 600, which fits
well with the range for the Blue Hills subperiod. The
Ellis point, on the other hand, comes from 41VV1895,
and is probably yet another example of a curated point
reused during the Late Prehistoric period.
Finally, a Late Prehistoric presence in the Dry
Devils River area is evidenced by the recovery of two
arrow points from 41VV1892. The two arrow points are
both fragmentary and poorly made and could not be
typed, but they presumably would date subsequent to
A.D. 630, during either the Flecha subperiod (A.D. 6301500) or the Infiemo phase (A.D. 1500-1780). None of
the sites yielded radiocarbon dates postdating A.D. 1500,
so these arrow points presumably date to the Flecha subperiod. Radiocarbon dates from 41VV1893-Midden 2,
41VV1895, and 41VV1897 also show occupations during the Flecha subperiod, but none yielded any arrow
points. As a postscript, none of the Dry Devils River
sites yielded any evidence of occupation by Toyah phase
peoples, as redefined by Johnson (1994). No bonetempered plainware pottery, steeply beveled end and
end/side scrapers, Perdiz and Cliffton arrow points, or
two- and four-beveled knives are present in any of the
excavated assemblages. Despite their presence at San
Felipe Springs (41VV444) in Del Rio, there was apparently nothing to draw them into the Dry Devils River
area, or if they were there, they were not making use of
burned rock midden sites. Given the degree of implied
continuity from the Late Archaic in this area, it is more
probable that the Late Prehistoric occupants of this area
were the same peoples who had been here in the previous
period.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

originally annular, and that domed middens are actually
annular middens that have not been recognized as such
due to erosion, disturbance, or inadequate investigation
(Black and Ellis 1997b).
As a result of their study of central Texas burned
rock middens, Black and Creel (1997) define the "classic" burned rock midden as
a circular, mounded accumulation some 1025 m across having a basic annular (concentric)
morphology - a dense ring of rocks surrounding a distinct center and surrounded by a thinning periphery. The center is defined by various
combinations of (1) a distinct surficial depression, (2) circular basin- and pit-shaped, clastand matrix-defined features 1-2.5 m in diameter, (3) overall lower rock density (relative to
the ring), (4) high ash and carbon content (relative to the outer ring and periphery), (5) evidence of repeated cultural (and often biological)
disturbance, and (6) a lower density of most
artifacts (relative to the midden periphery and,
to a lesser extent, the ring). Through time, the
basic structure of the classic burned rock midden is created through a center-focused formational process; debris (rocks, charcoal, ash,
burned soil, decayed organic matter, etc.) is
generated within its center and periodically dispersed outward, gradually forming a mounded
accumulation that is in essence a ring-shaped
debris cone. In other words, we see the classic
midden as a primary deposit built mainly of
refuse generated by activities that took place at
one spot, a designated cooking facility [Black
and Creel 1997:295].
The "center-focused cooking facility" model proposed by Black, Ellis, Creel, and Goode (1997) seems to
apply quite well to most of the burned rock middens
investigated along the Dry Devils River. In those cases
where the center of the midden was penetrated (i.e.,
41VV1892, 41VV1893-Midden 1, and 41VV1897), evidence for one or more "center-focused cooking facilities"
was identified. In those cases where only the periphery
of the midden was investigated (i.e., 41VV1893-Midden
2 and 41VV1893-Midden 3), nothing was found that
was inconsistent with the "center-focused cooking facility" model. Only the burned rock scatter at 41VV1895
did not seem to fit the model, possibly because it was
apparently only in use intermittently for less than 400
years. Thus, it may properly be considered an incipient
midden that, with continued use, would eventually have
achieved an annular or domed form. Nevertheless,
despite three broad trenches cut through the burned rock
scatter, no central cooking facility or central cooking
area could be identified at 41VV1895.

HOW DID THE DRY DEVILS RIVER
MIDDENS FORM?
It was noted in Chapter IV that burned rock middens are the most noticeable type of open-air site in the
Lower Pecos region, consisting of mounded accumulations of burned and fire-cracked limestone fragments that
presumably resulted from cooking activities. It is generally believed that the stones were used as heat conductors
for cooking food in pits or ovens. Reuse of a single pit or
the excavation of overlapping pits in a single location
eventually resulted in the formation of a burned rock
midden. It was further noted that two "types" of burned
rock middens have been historically identified in the
Lower Pecos region - "annular" or "ring" middens, and
"domed" middens. Finally, it was noted that Black, Ellis,
Creel, and Goode (1997) have disputed this "historical"
typology and proposed that most, if not all middens were

159

DATA RECOVERY OF FOUR SITES, VAL VERDE COUNTY

Finally, the evidence from 41 VV1897 strongly
suggests the presence of several rings of discarded
burned rock refuse surrounding at least two "centerfocused cooking facilities," one in the north central area
and the other in the south central area. The southern
facility may have been earlier and, based on burned rock
distributions, may have measured about 2 m across. No
difference in the fine matrix of the putative southern
cooking facility was noted, in comparison to the burned
rocks around it. The northern facility is believed to be
later, based on the presence of the remnant of an
earth/rock oven (Feature 1) associated with it. This
cooking facility is believed to have measured at least
1.5 m across and contained a noticeably lower density of
burned rocks as well as the oven remnant. Like the putative southern cooking facility, no difference in the fine
matrix was noted, in comparison to the burned rocks
around it. Three radiocarbon dates from 41VV1897 are
relevant to this model of midden formation. The oldest
date comes from near the base of the midden, on the
periphery; a more recent date (by about 900 years) comes
from the middle of the ring of discarded burned rocks
adjacent to the northern cooking facility; and the youngest date (about 400 years later than the date from the
ring) comes from the earth/rock oven remnant (Feature
1) in the northern cooking facility. Once again, this supports the view that the material in the burned midden surrounding the central cooking facility accumulated gradually, over a relatively long period of time, and that the
ring represents material removed from the central cooking facility during earlier cooking episodes.

As noted above, the best evidence for the "centerfocused cooking facility" model was present at
41VV1892, 41VV1893-Midden 1, and 41VV1897. The
internal configuration of the burned rock midden at
41VVl892 suggested that there were at least two "center-focused cooking facilities" at the site, a view supported by the distribution of burned rocks and by five
radiocarbon dates. The earlier cooking facility was in the
northern portion of the midden, and consisted of a
roughly circular area of very dark gray to black, "ashy"
soil with inclusions of burned rocks, measuring
approximately 4.25 m north to south by 3.75 m east to
west. This was in turn apparently surrounded by a circular ring of less "ashy," dark gray loam, with a greater
density of burned rocks, measuring about 6.75 m north to
south by 7 .25 m east to west. The two radiocarbon samples date the ring of discarded burned rocks earlier than
the intact fill of the cooking facility, possibly by about 30
years or so, supporting the view that the ring represents
material removed from the central cooking facility during earlier cooking episodes. The later "center-focused
cooking facility" was identified in the southern portion
of the midden and seemed to be characterized by a relatively low density area of burned rock fragments, surrounded by what seemed to have been a higher-density
ring of burned rocks. The shape and dimensions of this
facility are uncertain, but it was probably circular, measuring perhaps 3 m across. This "cooking facility" lacked
the dark, "ashy" soil that was characteristic of the northern one, probably due to the greater degree of bioturbation in this area. The three radiocarbon samples from this
area indicated that the old ground surface was roughly
contemporary with the ring of discarded burned rocks,
which was in turn older than the fill of the putative
cooking facility, by about 50 years or so. Once again,
this supports the view that the ring represents material
removed from the central cooking facility during earlier
cooking episodes.
The internal configuration of Midden 1 at
41VV1893 suggested that there was at least one "centerfocused cooking facility," a view supported by the distribution of burned rocks and dark, "ashy" soil, surrounded
by a "ring" of denser burned rocks measuring about 5 to
6 m across. Based on the distribution of burned rocks,
the central cooking facility in Midden 1 may have measured about 2 m across. A sequence of three radiocarbon
dates from the ring of discarded burned rocks adjacent to
the putative central cooking feature is in rough stratigraphic sequence, with the lowest date being the earliest
and the two upper dates being almost identical at the
2-sigma level. These three dates cover a period of 380
years, at the 2-sigma level. This supports the view that
the material in the burned rock ring accumulated gradually, over a relatively long period of time, probably by
intermittent steps as the central cooking facility was
used, cleaned, and then reused.

WHAT FOODS WERE PROCESSED/COOKED
AT THE DRY DEVILS RNER MIDDENS?
In Chapter IV, it was noted that, generally, burned
rock middens are believed represent the remains of
cooking facilities for the "baking/steaming/roasting of
carbohydrate-rich nuts, bulbs, roots, and pads" (Black
and Creel 1997:300). Floral, faunal, and coprolite
remains recovered from the dry rockshelters in the
Lower Pecos region have shown that subsistence
throughout the prehistoric period in this area was based
primarily on plant collecting, with the most important of
these plant resources being prickly pear and desert succulents, such as sotol and lechuguilla. Excavations of
burned rock middens at Hinds Cave indicate that they
were earth ovens used for the processing of desert succulents (Dering 1977; Shafer 1981). Two more-recent
studies, one by LuAnn W andsnider and one by Phil
Dering, address the topic of food resources utilized in
burned rock middens. W andsnider (1997) conducted an
exhaustive study of potential prehistoric food resources
and their suitability for earth oven cooking in terms of
food chemistry and nutritional value. Dering (1999) examined models of prehistoric subsistence and argues that

cover the bottom with a layer of fuel and stone, and set
the fuel on fire; (2) after the fire has burned down, leaving a layer of hot stones, cover with a layer of moist
vegetation, and the food material to be cooked, and cover
with another layer of vegetation; (3) finally, cover the
entire pit with a layer of earth to seal in the heat and
allow to bake (see Leach and Bousman 200l:Figure 7-3,
for a graphic portrayal of these steps).
In a discussion of what resource was being prepared in central Texas burned rock middens, Black and
Creel ( 1997) list a number of advantages that sotol would
have as a food resource.

the desert plants sotol, lechuguilla, and prickly pear,
processed in earth ovens, are not suitable as stable
resources that might have induced inhabitants toward a
less-mobile, more-sedentary occupation of the Lower
Pecos canyonlands. He demonstrates that the caloric
return per labor expended is extremely low for this
activity, and consumption of food plants and firewood
would rapidly deplete a location's readily available resources. Due to these limiting factors, Dering suggests
that earth oven-processed desert succulents probably
served as a famine food during periods of seasonal stress
rather than dietary mainstays.
Ethnographic accounts from the American Southwest provide descriptions of the use of heated rocks in
baking pits for the preparation of agave by the Chiricahua Apache:

(1) when properly prepared, sotol is tasty and
nutritious providing large amounts of carbohydrates and modest fat and protein values;
(2) where it thrives, it forms dense stands that
represent tremendous resource concentrations;
(3) it is extremely drought tolerant; (4) it can be
processed in relatively large batches in rock/
earth ovens; (5) once baked, it can be dried and
stored for long periods of time; and (6) while it
is apparently most nutritious in the spring just
before it flowers, it can be eaten at any time
during the year, particularly during the winter
during the annual biomass low point. As noted
in Chapter 10, sotol must be baked/steamed for
extended periods of time, making it a prime
candidate for oven cooking [Black and Creel
1997:298-299].

Pits in which the crowns were baked were about
ten to twelve feet in diameter and three to four
feet deep, lined with large flat rocks .... Upon
this, oak and juniper wood was placed, and
before the sun came up was set on fire. By noon
the fire had died down, and on these hot stones
was laid moist grass, such as bunch grass ....
The largest mescal crown was selected . . . they
threw it in and threw in the other crowns after
it. ... After the mescal had been covered with
the long leaves of bear grass and the whole with
earth to a depth sufficient to prevent steam from
escaping (Castetter et al. 1938b:28-29).
The same source also provides a description of agave
baking among the southern Diegue:fio of California:

In support of this likelihood, Black and Creel (1997) note
the recovery of the remains of sotol/yucca from Late
Prehistoric contexts at 41UV86 and 41MS32, in Uvalde
and Mason Counties; from Late Archaic contexts at the
Jonas Terrace site (41ME29) in Medina County; and
from earlier Archaic contexts at the Woodrow Heard site
(41UV88) in Uvalde County (Black and Creel 1997:
299).
Black and Creel (1997) also note the possibility of
prickly pear having been an important resource tied to
the use of rock/earth ovens. In this regard, they state that
"while ripe tunas (prickly pear fruit) do not need baking,
unripe tunas and nopals were sometimes baked by Native
Americans" (Black and Creel 1997:299). In support of
this, it should be noted that prickly pad seeds, pads, and
stems have been identified at several of the sites reported
by Black et al (1997) and at the Jonas Terrace site (Black
and Creel 1997:299).
Dry screening and flotation at all of the Dry Devils
River sites resulted in the recovery of the remains of 15
taxa of plant that were presumably used at various times
by the prehistoric occupants of the region (Table 90; also
see Appendix A). These include 13 taxa of wood that
were presumably used for fuel, and four plants of potential economic importance - prickly pear, sotol/ yucca,
walnut, and juniper/cedar.

In this region, pits averaged six feet in diameter
with nine feet as the maximum. They were dug
in sandy soil and lined with boulders, the latter
often extending high enough on the margin to
form a raised rim . . . after the boulders were
sufficiently heated a matting of agave leaves
were laid. Upon this the agave flower stalks or
crowns were placed, and in turn covered with
another layer of leaves. The charge was then
baked over with sand.... The pits were used
over and over again each season. Due to the
clearing out of the pits and replacement of firecracked boulders with new ones, some pits have
a marginal refuse dump of considerable size
(Castetter et al. 1938b:45).

These, and many other ethnographic accounts (see, for
example, Barret and Gifford 1933; Beals 1932; Bell and
Castetter 1941; Boas 1930; Carlson and Jones 1940;
Castetter and Opler 1936; Castetter and Underhill 1935;

and use of an earth oven for baking-(1) dig a pit and

was described historically as involving heating "in a
kiln" (see Appendix A). Following cooking, the sotol
could be pounded into thin sheets, sun-dried, and ground
into flour. In this fashion, the food could be kept for several months. As noted above, remains of sotol/yucca
were recovered from all of the Dry Devils River burned
rock middens, except one (41VV1893-Midden 2), and
were associated with all temporal subperiods, except the
Cibola (1200-350 B.C.). In this light, it should be noted
that both Midden 2 at 41VV1893, which did not yield
any sotol/yucca remains, and Midden 3 at 41VV1893,
which was the only midden that gave evidence of being
utilized during the Cibola subperiod, yielded the smallest
samples of plant remains and neither was excavated
beyond the periphery of the midden. Thus, it is quite
likely that sampling error accounts for the failure to
recover the remains of sotol/yucca from Midden 2, or
from Cibola subperiod levels at Midden 3.
While sotol/yucca is the most likely candidate for
what was prepared in the Dry Devils River burned rock
middens, nutshells of the littleleaf walnut were the most
common food remains recovered from the sites (see
Table 91). Nutshells were most abundant overall by
weight, they were recovered from all of the middens,
they were present in contexts of all subperiods, and they
were the most ubiquitous plant remain from the flotation
samples overall, as well as from most individual sites
(Table 92). Littleleaf walnut has been identified in
archeological contexts elsewhere in the Lower Pecos
region, and Dering (see Appendix A) notes that walnuts
could have been an important source of needed oil in a
desert environment. Although Black and Creel (1997)
have suggested that nuts and acorns could have been
processed in earth ovens, the evidence is still weak. What
may be more significant is that, in the Sonoran Desert at
least, walnut meat was sometimes mixed with baked
agave (Dering, in Appendix A). The Southeastern Yavapai placed the nut meat on a dried agave cake and
pounded it. The mix was soaked in water and then consumed. Ground walnuts were also added to baked agave
by the Mescalero Apache. Unfortunately, it is not clear in
either case if the walnuts were added at the time the
agave was prepared, or at a later date. The Yavapai case
suggests the latter, while the Apache case could indicate
the former.
The final possible food resource yielded by the Dry
Devils River sites consisted of three juniper/cedar seeds
recovered from Midden 1 at 41VV1893. Dering (see
Appendix A) notes ethnobotanic evidence from the
Southwest for the use of fruit from various species of
juniper, including the western juniper, alligator juniper,
and oneseed juniper, for spices, sauces, and relishes. The
fruits were also boiled and eaten, and could be stored for
winter use after boiling. Apparently, juniper seeds have
been recovered from archeological contexts in the earlier

One prickly pear pad fragment was recovered from
41VV1892 and three prickly pear seeds were recovered
from 41VV1897 (Table 91). Dering (see Appendix A)
notes that prickly pear was a staple of the prehistoric
inhabitants of the Lower Pecos region and that green
prickly pear tunas (fruit) were baked in ovens. Tunas
were apparently gathered in late summer and were eaten
either raw or sun-dried. Green tunas were apparently
baked in pit-ovens and would have contained abundant
seeds. Thus, the three seeds from 41VV1897 could have
come from tunas that were baked in a pit-oven in the
center of the burned rock midden there. Young prickly
pear pads (nopalitos) were reportedly eaten with minimal
cooking, while, more importantly, the larger pads were
reportedly used to line earth ovens to provide moisture
and keep dirt off the baked foodstuffs (Black and Dering
2001). Thus, the prickly pear pad fragment from
41VV1892 could indicate either the use of prickly pear
as a food source, or as cooking furniture for one of the
pit-ovens there.
Sotol/yucca fiber bundles were recovered from all
four of the Dry Devils River sites, although they were
not present in all of the middens (see Table 91). Dering
(see Appendix A) notes that both yucca and sotol were
important prehistoric food resources in the Lower Pecos
region, and were commonly baked in earth ovens for an
extensive length of time to render them edible. The central stem of the plant, called the "heart," is high in both
moisture and carbohydrates and was commonly baked in
earth ovens for 36 to 48 hours in order to breakdown poisonous compounds (Dering, Appendix A). Dering goes
on to note that large quantities of sotol were recovered
from Baker Cave and Hinds Cave, and the processing

been identified include a shift from lechuguilla to sotol
between about 4000 and 2500 B.C., and an increase in
rabbit and fish at this same time (Lord 1984). A shortterm shift to bison exploitation seems to have occurred
around 1000 B.C., presumably related to a mesic interval
that resulted in the expansion of grassland and bison
herds from the southern Plains (Bement 1989:74). After
about 500 B.C., there was a return to more-xeric conditions and the subsistence system returned to a reliance on
desert succulents and deer, rabbit, and fish.
Unfortunately, the data on charred plant remains
from the Dry Devils River sites shed no light on the proposed shift from lechuguilla to sotol between about 4000

levels of Hinds Cave, on the Devils River (Dering, in
Appendix A). Although juniper fruit could have been
used as a food resource at 41VV1893-Midden 1, it is
unlikely that they were prepared in pit-ovens. In summary, circumstantial evidence strongly favors sotol/
yucca as the primary food resource that was being prepared in the burned rock middens along the Dry Devils
River.
While the types of plants being exploited appear to
have remained unchanged throughout the prehistoric
period, particular emphasis on specific resources may
have fluctuated, based on both local and regional factors.
Important changes in the Lower Pecos diet that have

and 2500 B.C., but the implied shift away from desert
succulents around 1000 B.C., and the return to more xeric
conditions with an associated increase in desert succulents after about 500 B.C., can be clearly seen in the Dry
Devils River data, in terms both of the number of radiocarbon-dated samples (Figure 59) and the combined
weight of all samples (Figure 60). Less expected is an
apparent decline in the use of littleleaf walnut through
time (see Figures 59 and 60). Actually, this may be an
illusion created by the relatively large amount of walnut
shells recovered from contexts identified as belonging to
the early Middle Archaic period (Eagle Nest subperiod).
Nevertheless, this potential trend is well worth looking
for at other sites in the Lower Pecos and west central
Texas regions, to either confirm it or refute it.

actual burned rock midden may represent a later component at the site, which was actually in "continuous" use
for a maximum of 1,500 years. Only Midden 2 at
41VVl893 seems to show a real reoccupation of an early
burned rock midden location by a later group that added
to the midden. Midden 2 was apparently in "continuous"
use for a maximum of 700 years during the Middle
Archaic period, and was subsequently reused for another
700 years during the Late Archaic-Late Prehistoric
period (see Figure 58). Apparently, while many central
Texas middens seem to have been used over and over
again for long periods of time (Black and Creel
1997:Figure 133), the Dry Devils River middens had
relatively short, discrete use-lives.
As argued above, the burned rock middens identified at the Dry Devils River sites were almost certainly
the residue of cooking activities, and the location of
cooking facilities. The "center-focused cooking facility"
model, described above, can be applied to most, if not
all, of the middens. Beyond these generalities, there may
have been some differences in the manner in which the
middens functioned within the larger site context. As
noted above, two possible "center-focused cooking
facilities" were tentatively identified at 41 VV1892 - an
earlier one in the north and a later one in the south. The
bulk of the lithic debitage was distributed south of the
earlier cooking facility, and may have surrounded the
later facility.
The bulk of the lithic debitage from Midden 1 at
41VVl893 extended out to the northeastern periphery of
the midden, and was generally associated with the greatest density of burned rocks, suggesting that the depositional dynamics for both debitage and burned rocks was
similar, if not the same. Chipped stone tools were only
present within the midden, suggesting either that all toolusing activities took place on the midden, or that the
tools were deposited there as refuse. With one exception,
all tools were recovered in the same area that yielded the
greatest density of burned rocks and debitage. This mixture of formal tools, expedient tools, and stone-working
tools within a relatively small area suggests a trash disposal area rather than a primary use area.
The distribution of the lithic debitage recovered
from Midden 2 at 41VV1893 was different from that of
the burned rocks, with the greatest density of debitage
present on the midden periphery. Of the small sample of
chipped stone tools recovered from Midden 2, over half
were from well beyond the limits of the burned rock
midden, and outside the area of greatest debitage density.
Taken together, the horizontal distribution of burned
rocks, debitage, and tools, suggests a variety of different
activities occurring around the periphery of Midden 2,
with some debris being deposited on the midden itself
The horizontal distribution of burned rocks
recorded in the excavation units at Midden 3 at
41VV1893 suggests that the core of the midden was par-

HOW DID THE DRY DEVILS RIVER
MIDDENS FUNCTION WITHIN IBE SITE
CONTEXT?

The radiocarbon data from the Dry Devils River
sites indicate that all of the middens were utilized over
hundreds of years. In addition, stratigraphic data from all
of the burned rock middens suggest multiple episodes of
midden deposition and stabilization, suggesting that the
process of midden construction at all sites was one of
gradual aggradation and accretion. Artifact data suggest
that all of the burned rock middens investigated at the
Dry Devils River sites are characterized by multiple
reutilizations with subsequent mixing due to disturbance
and bioturbation. Most of them show multiple peaks in
the vertical distribution of both chipped stone artifacts
and burned rocks, while peaks in the occurrence of Rabdotus shells indicate populations of Rabdotus residing on
the surface prior to construction of the midden, as well as
hiatuses in midden construction. This indicates that most
of the middens were constructed over a significant period
of time.
Despite this, with only two exceptions, midden-use
seems to have been relatively "continuous" or "discrete."
The use of the term "continuous" is not intended to
imply that midden-use was constant, or that the sites
were occupied continually for long periods of time, or
that they were even visited every year. Instead, it implies
that for some unspecified period of time, a specific site
was apparently a constant feature in the social landscape,
visited at whatever interval was most suitable, and then it
was not (see Figure 58). This maximum period of "continuous" use based on 2-sigma radiocarbon intervals
ranged from as much as 1,700 years for 41VV1893Midden 3, to as little as 400 years for 41VV1895. Only
41VV1893-Midden 2 and 41VV1897 showed a pattern
that could be interpreted as later revisitation and reuse. In
the case of 41VV1897, the earlier use of the site (ca.
2300--1800 B.C.) may not have been associated with the
construction of a burned rock midden at all. Instead, the

tially penetrated and was characterized by a high density
of burned rocks. Although there was a high density of
lithic debitage overlapping somewhat with the highest
density of burned rocks, the greatest density of debitage
was found closer to the southern edge of the midden. The
distribution of the tools at Midden 3 suggests a concentric arrangement of activities within the midden periphery. Assuming the central area of Midden 3 was related
to cooking, the biface tools and utilized bifaces surrounding it may have been related to either food processing or cooking, while the scrapers, drill, and utilized
flakes farther away from the center may have been used
in nonfood-related activities.
Site 41VV1895 was characterized by a diffuse,
burned rock scatter, or incipient midden. The highest
densities of burned rocks and chipped stone debitage
suggest that the core of the midden was located in the
extreme southeastern portion of the site. Most of the
chipped stone tools were recovered beyond the core area
to the north and west, in what can be considered the
midden periphery.
The highest density of debitage at 41VVl897
appears to have occurred at the outer edge of the midden
core, and may represent either secondary chipping debris
deposited with the discarded burned rocks, or primary or
secondary deposition unrelated to the discarding of
burned rocks, or both. Most of the stone tools recovered
from 41VVl897 were associated with the core of the
burned rock midden, and may represent secondary refuse
deposits. Nevertheless, the presence of five cores and
two failed bifaces in the midden periphery suggests the
possibility of at least some lithic reduction beyond the
midden core.
Although burned rock middens were obviously
important to the prehistoric occupants of the Dry Devils
River area, they almost certainly did not have the
importance ascribed to them by modem archeologists.
They were, after all, merely cooking facilities, large
cooking facilities to be sure, but cooking facilities nonetheless. The data from the four Dry Devils River sites
suggest that primary living activities were located adjacent to the midden, and that the middens were in fact
probably spatially peripheral to the occupation area.
Whether or not the living activities in the vicinity of the
middens were limited to food preparation, and whether
or not the area was inhabited only while the midden was
being constructed is not known, but probably would have
depended on the availability of other resources in the surrounding area.
As cooking facilities, the burned rock middens
would have been used and then abandoned. The data
from the four Dry Devils River sites indicate that they
were periodically revisited and reused over a discrete
period of time that may have been as long as 1,700 years.
Then they ceased to be used and were generally not visited again, although nearby middens did continue to be

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

used. Why one midden was abandoned and a nearby one
continued in use is not known. While the middens were
in use, they were probably important cooking facilities,
but whether or not they were the only, or even the primary, reason for being at the site is, again, not known,
although most archeologists would probably argue that it
was.
EXPLAINING MIDDEN-TO-MIDDEN
VARIATION
Analysis of the data from each of the four Dry
Devils River sites has resulted in the definition of seven
components that can be compared with each other and
with other sites in the Lower Pecos region. In all cases,
the material from the burned rock midden has necessarily
been lumped together as a single component. In most
cases, these "components" represent hundreds of years of
"continuous" utilization. The single exception is Midden
3 at 41VV18 93, which was apparently utilized during the
Middle Archaic period and subsequently during the Late
Archaic-Late Prehistoric periods, and was thus subjected
to greater mixing of material. In the case of 41VVl897,
two artifact assemblages were defined, one representing
material associated with the burned rock midden (Late
Archaic-Late Prehistoric) and the other representing
material on the older ground surface (Middle Archaic).
All of these artifact assemblages are tabulated on Table
93. The assemblages are divided into five main classes of
tools, including projectile points, formal biface tools,
formal uniface tools, informal utilized tools, and lithic
reduction rejects.
Although sample sizes differ radically, and many
tools are not present in all assemblages, some significant
patterns can be identified. The ostensibly non-midden
assemblage from 41VV1897 stands out in several
regards. It shows the highest proportion of projectile
points (20 percent) and the highest proportion of lithic
reduction rejects (73.3 percent). It also shows the lowest
proportion of informal utilized tools (6. 7 percent) and no
formal biface or uniface tools. The midden assemblages
all appear to be more similar in regard to the proportions
of these five tools classes, although there is still a great
deal of variability.
Although it is admittedly dangerous to generalize
from so small a sample, it is suggested that the differences between the single non-midden assemblage, and
all the other assemblages, is due to site function. Projectile points and lithic reduction rejects are strongly associated with the non-midden assemblage at 41VV1897,
while formal bifacial and unifacial tools, as well as informal utilized tools, are more strongly associated with
midden assemblages. A number of researchers in the
Lower Pecos region have assumed that projectile points
were primarily used in hunting activities, while unifaces
were primarily plant-processing tools (Alexander 1974;

Briuer 1977; Collins 1974; Mcconaughy 1978; Saunders
1986; Shafer and Holloway 1977). Studies of unifaces
from Hinds Cave support the view that they were used to
slice desert succulents (Shafer 1978), while unifaces with
similar polish or wear patterns have been recovered from
burned rock midden sites along the Pecos River in
Crockett County (Moore 1983). In contrast, the sample
of tools from the Dry Devils River sites examined under
the microscope for use-wear did not reveal any sort of
polish or wear that could be linked to the slicing of desert
succulents alone. They did, however, reveal a wide range
of wear types, including cutting and slicing, carried out
on a variety of materials of differing degrees of hardness,
ranging from fresh hide, soft plants, or meat to bone,
antler, or stone. Undoubtedly some, if not much, of this
wear was the result of plant processing, but it also probably included a wide range of other types of activities.
Taking this into account, the pattern evinced by the nonmidden assemblage is probably due to more-limited
activities being carried out at the site. This in tum may
be a function of (1) a shorter occupation, or less :frequent
reoccupations, with concomitantly fewer activities;
(2) heavier reliance on hunting vs. other types of
activities (including plant processing); and (3) morefrequent lithic reduction.
Floral, faunal, and coprolite remains recovered
from the dry rockshelters to the south have shown that

throughout the prehistoric period subsistence was based
primarily on plant collecting (Bement 1989; Bryant
1969, 1974; Riskind 1970; Williams-Dean 1978). The
most important of these plant resources are generally
believed to have been Opuntia and desert succulents,
such as sotol and lechuguilla. This diet was supplemented by animal protein from deer, rabbits, birds, fish,
and lizards (Lord 1984). Burned rock middens excavated
at sites along the Pecos River in Crockett County yielded
few formal tools, but did contain a relatively large
assemblage of lithic debitage, discarded unifacial tools,
burin-struck cores, and burin spalls, with a few projectile
points (Moore 1983), similar to the Dry Devils River
sites. Unifaces recovered from several of these sites
showed polish or wear patterns similar to specimens
from Hinds Cave that were used to slice desert succulents (Moore 1983; Shafer 1978).
Closer to the Dry Devils River, two burned rock
middens were excavated in 1989 in the Devils River
State Natural Area between the Devils River and the Dry
Devils River (Turpin and Davis 1993). Excavations at
the Windmill Midden site (41 VV964) yielded a large
tool assemblage (Table 94). Diagnostic artifacts indicated episodic use during the Early Archaic, Late
Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. At least one uniface with silica sheen was recovered, suggesting that
some processing of desert succulents may have been

undertaken here (Turpin and Davis 1993:Figure 14g).
The nearby Spring Midden site yielded a smaller tool
assemblage but a wider variety of lithic tools (see Table
94). The projectile points from the site indicated Early
Archaic, Late Archaic, and Late Prehistoric occupations
(Turpin and Davis 1993:Table 6). On the basis of these
data, the Windmill Midden site was interpreted as
reflecting task-oriented exploitation of the uplands, while
the Spring Midden site was seen as a typical large campsite in a riverine setting, with a long history of occupation. Test excavations at two rockshelters in the same
area yielded large tool samples with a wide variety of
tool types (see Table 94). Diagnostic projectile points
indicated that 41 VV209 was largely Late Paleoindian to
Middle Archaic in age, while 41VV889 contained material from the Late Paleoindian to the Late Prehistoric
period. In terms of number of tools and range of tools
present, the Dry Devils River sites seem to be most
similar to the Spring Midden site, interpreted as a riverine campsite. The range of wear evidenced by the tools
recovered from the Dry Devils River sites is also more
compatible with multifunction campsites.
Assemblage differences that can be ascribed to
temporal variations are less clear cut. The two assemblages associated with the Middle Archaic (41VVl897-

Non-Midden and 41VV1893-Midden 1) have the lowest
proportions of formal unifacial tools (0.0-6. 7 percent),
the lowest proportion of informal tools (6.7-26.7 percent), and the highest proportion of lithic reduction
rejects (46.7-73.3 percent). In contrast, the two assemblages dated to the Late Archaic-Late Prehistoric interval
(41VV1897-Midden and 41VV1892) show higher proportions of both formal unifacial tools (both at 25 percent) and informal tools (32.7-37.5 percent), with lower
proportions of lithic reduction rejects (15.4-28.1 percent). Finally, what appears to be the latest site in the
sample (41VVl895) has the highest proportion of formal
unifacial tools (28.6 percent) and the highest (save one)
proportion of informal tools (46.4 percent). The only site
with a higher proportion of informal tools is 41VV1893Midden 2, but its sample of tools is only six and held to
be unreliable. Interestingly, the proportion of lithic
reduction rejects at 41VV1895 is lower than it is at any
other site (7.1 percent). This clearly suggests that formal
unifacial tools and informal tools of all types became
more common through time in the Dry Devils River area,
but why this should be the case is not clear. The usewear study conducted on samples of tools from each
midden clearly shows that these tools were used for a
wide variety of activities, and that any individual tool
169

DATA RECOVERY OF FOUR SITES, VAL VERDE COUNTY

often had multiple uses. Moreover, an examination of the
data strongly suggests that the number of tool uses identified is strongly related to the number of tools examined.
Thus, a greater number of tools occurring through time
suggests a greater variety of activities taking place on the
sites through time. Perhaps, as Dering has suggested, the
Lower Pecos economy became more broad-based
through time "in response to a patchy and unpredictable
environment" (Dering 1999:669), and this is reflected in
a greater number formal and informal tools and a broader
range of tool uses.
As noted above, the charred plant remains recovered from the Dry Devils River sites strongly suggest
that the burned rock middens were used to process desert
succulents collected in the area, specifically sotol/yucca.
The charred plants believed to be associated with the
non-midden occupation at 41VV1897 indicate the use of
littleleaf walnut for food, and juniper/cedar and mesquite/acacia for fuel, with no desert succulents. Admittedly, sample size is a problem, but the lack of desert
succulents is suggestive. It may be that the non-midden
sites in general served as hunting, and possibly generalpurpose, campsites. Today, sotol, lechuguilla, and
prickly pear are all found within the Upland Juniper
Shrub vegetational community to the east of the Dry
Devils River sites, while prey animals, such as deer, turkey, javelina, and quail, would have been abundant
within the Bottornland Grassland community to the west
of the sites.
In regard to lithic technology, some differences
have already been noted at 41VV1897, where the sample
of debitage from Unit 4 indicated that the material from
the lowest levels of the pre-midden assemblage were
characterized by less variability in debitage size, and a
preponderance of soft-hammer platforms and cortex
pieces. The samples of analyzed lithic debitage from the
burned rock middens themselves showed little or no
technological differences, from top to bottom. While a
comparison of all assemblages from the four Dry Devils
River sites (Table 95) shows a number of differences,
most of these cannot be definitely linked to period of
occupation. Table 95 does suggest that there may be a
decline in the proportion of large flakes (i.e., flakes
greater than 25.4 mm) through time, from the Middle
Archaic (mean= 22.3 percent), to the Middle-Late
Archaic (10.1 percent), to the Late Archaic-Late Prehistoric (mean= 16.1 percent), to the later Late Prehistoric
(13 percent). Other possible trends in lithic technology
include less reliance on hard-hammer reduction during
the Late Prehistoric period, a decline in cortex flakes,
and less heat treatment. The ratio of hard-to-soft-hammer
platforms may drop from around 2.5:1 to 2.8:1 for the
Middle Archaic to about 1.1: 1 for the end of the Late
Prehistoric. Likewise, the proportion of cortex flakes

seems to drop from a mean of 28.3 percent for the Middle Archaic, to 9.4 percent for the Middle-Late Archaic,
to a mean of20.l percent for the Late Archaic-Late Prehistoric and 20.4 percent for the later Late Prehistoric. At
the same time, the proportion of debitage showing evidence of heating drops from a mean of 47.6 percent to
38.5 percent (see Table 95).
Most of the burned rock middens investigated along
the Dry Devils River by the current project would be
classified as domed middens (Table 96). The two burned
rock middens excavated in 1989 in the Devils River State
Natural Area (Turpin and Davis 1993) were comparable
in depth to the middens excavated along the Dry Devils
River. The Windmill Midden site was relatively shallow
(less than 24 cm), while the Spring Midden site ranged
from 20 to 50 cm thick. As was the case with the artifact
assemblages, the Dry Devils River sites appear to be
more similar to the Spring Midden site in terms of midden thickness. Unfortunately, no data are available
regarding the horizontal dimensions of these two middens.
Comparative data on a sample of 67 burned rock
middens from 18 counties to the east of the Lower Pecos
region show that the burned rock middens at the Dry
Devils River sites are well within the range of variability
for central Texas middens (Decker 1997:Table 119). In
terms of maximum diameter, the Dry Devils River sample falls within 1 standard deviation to either side of the
mean for the central Texas sample (15.29 ± 7.99 m;
range = 5 to 40 m), as it does for maximum height
(.69 ± .38 m; range= .15 to 2 m for central Texas). Several potential central pits, or cooking facilities, were
identified in the Dry Devils River sample. Although their
dimensions could only be guessed at, most also fall
within 1 standard deviation to either side of the mean for
central Texas middens, in regard to both diameter
(2.41 ± 1.11 m; range= 1 to 5 m) and height (.69 ± .41;
range = 0.3 to 1.5 m). The putative northern pit at
41VV1892 is the single exception to this, having a larger
diameter than most of the central Texas pits. The density
of burned rocks in the Dry Devils River sample falls well
below the mean for the central Texas sites (786.61
± 814.94 kg/m3 ; range 124 to 3,747 kg/m3), while in
most cases the lithic artifact density at the Dry Devils
River sites falls close to mean for the middens in central
Texas (1,086.03 ± 4,335.34 artifacts/m3 ; range= 7 to
24,713 artifacts/m3). The only exceptions are Midden 1
and Midden 2 at 41VV1893, with lithic densities well
below the mean for central Texas (it should be noted
here that the lithic densities for the Devils River sites are
probably inflated due to the use of Vs-inch-mesh screen,
rather than 'l4-inch mesh). The form and shape similarities argue for similar overall function, as do the similar
dimensions.

DATA RECOVERY OF fOUR SITES, VAL VERDE COUNTY

WHY DID THE DRY DEVILS RIVER
MIDDENS FORM WHERE THEY DID?

Of all the research questions posed by Black, Creel,
and Ellis (1997), this is perhaps the most difficult to
answer satisfactorily. All of the Dry Devils River sites
were located at or close to the point where the valley
walls met the floodplain of the Dry Devils River. The
uplands to the east of the sites are underlain by the Segovia Member of the Edwards Limestone and would have
provided an almost unlimited supply of rocks for use in
earth/rock oven cooking. An added attraction in the case
of sites 41VV1892 and 41VV1893 was probably the
existence of abundant lithic raw material on the ridge
between the two sites.
Water would probably have been a more limiting
factor in determining site location than stone, however,
and all of the Dry Devils River sites were located adjacent to small drainages or arroyos that exited the uplands
to the east and flowed down into the floodplain of the
Dry Devils River. Today, none of these drainages are
permanent, and they may not have been in the past
either, but they almost certainly provided water on a seasonal basis. Another question that cannot be answered is
how close the channel of the Dry Devils River was to
these sites in the past, and how permanent was its flow.
According to current maps, the river, or one of its tributary channels, is within 100 to 150 m of each site. Today,

most of the precipitation in the area falls between April
and October, with May, June, September, and October
seeing most of this. Some, if not all, of these drainages
would probably have contained water during these
months.
In regard to economically important plants and
animals, all of the Dry Devils River sites are located on
or near the ecotone between the Upland Juniper Shrub
vegetational community on the slopes to the east, and the
Bottomland Grassland vegetational community on the
floodplain to the west. It has already been noted that the
former would have provided sotol, lechuguilla, and
prickly pear, while the latter would have provided littleleaf walnut, as well deer, turkey, javelina, and quail.
Fuel for heating the rocks for the earth/rock ovens at the
sites could have come from both vegetational communities. Plants known to have supplied fuel to the Dry Devils River middens include acacia, agarita, broomweed,
juniper, mesquite, guayacan, and Mexican persimmon,
available in the Upland Juniper Shrub vegetational community, and oak, mesquite, juniper, hackberry, guayacan,
cedar, and walnut, available in the Bottomland Grassland
vegetational community.
All of these considerations probably played a role
in determining the location of the Dry Devils River middens. Whether there were other factors involved in these
choices will probably never be known.
