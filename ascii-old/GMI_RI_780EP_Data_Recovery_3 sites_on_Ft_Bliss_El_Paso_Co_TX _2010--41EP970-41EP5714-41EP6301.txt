13. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES

The Fort Bliss Directorate of Public Works Environmental Division (Fort Bliss DPW-E) contracted Geo-Marine, Inc., (GMI) to
conduct archaeological data recovery at three sites within Training Area (TA) 1B. The three sites examined during this project were
41EP970 (FB 7520), 41EP5714 (FB 12284), and 41EP6301 (FB 12245). Work was performed in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended) and the mitigation of adverse effects to historic properties as defined by the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation’s implementing regulations as set forth in 36 CFR Part 800. The work plan for this project
included the development of a “phased mitigation” strategy that apportioned the funding resources and focus of the project toward the
most productive of the three sites designated for data recovery investigation. The current project was performed in two phases. Each
of three sites was field evaluated during the initial phase (Phase I) to characterize the nature and extent of their cultural deposits. After
the initial characterization in Phase 1, only one of the project sites (41EP970/FB 7520) was found to contain sufficient cultural material
to address the research questions related to Late Archaic and early Formative period technological and settlement organization. This
site contained intact feature remains with associated quantities of surface artifacts to provide a viable sample of artifacts associated with
features. The remaining two sites (41EP5714/FB 12284 and 41EP6301/FB 12245) lacked intact feature remains and significant
quantities of associated cultural materials and therefore could not provide sufficient data to address the questions in the research design.
Mechanical testing on the three sites revealed that the geomorphic integrity had been severely compromised on two of the sites. The
horizontal integrity of all cultural materials on 41EP6301 (FB 12245) had been compromised in the late historic to early modern period
for military training. A large area of the site was bulldozed to create army hull downs and bivouac areas. The geomorphic integrity of
41EP5714 (FB 12284) is also compromised due to deflation. The remains of the single feature on this site are minimal and deflated,
there are few artifacts, and subsurface materials and additional features were lacking.

ABSTRACT
The Fort Bliss Directorate of Public Works Environmental Division (Fort Bliss DPW-E)
contracted Geo-Marine, Inc., (GMI) to conduct archaeological data recovery at three sites within
Training Area (TA) 1B, in the central portion of the Hueco Bolson in far west Texas. The three
sites examined during this project were 41EP970 (FB 7520), 41EP5714 (FB 12284), and
41EP6301 (FB 12245). Work was performed in compliance with Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended) and the mitigation of adverse effects to historic
properties as defined by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation’s implementing
regulations as set forth in 36 CFR Part 800.
As specified in the research design, the work plan for this project included a “phased mitigation”
strategy that apportioned the funding resources and archaeological focus of the project toward the
most productive subset of sites out of the three project sites designated for data recovery
investigation.
The current project was performed in two phases. All three sites were field evaluated during the
initial phase (Phase I) of the project to characterize the nature and extent of their cultural deposits.
Evaluation during Phase I consisted of surface mapping, feature definition, recording of all
surface artifacts, collection of artifacts, and geomorphic evaluation of the depositional units
identified in backhoe trenches and assessment of each site’s potential for subsurface cultural
materials.
After the initial site characterization in Phase 1, only one of the three project sites (41EP970/FB
7520) was found to contain sufficient cultural material to provide data that could address the
research questions set forth in the research design for this project. The remaining two sites lacked
intact feature remains, had limited quantities of surface artifacts, lacked a statistically viable
sample of artifacts associated with dateable features, and their geomorphic integrity had been
compromised. Therefore, additional excavation at these two sites was not warranted and the field
and lab time was reallocated toward the more substantial site, 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Phase II entailed mitigation of 41EP970 (FB 7520). In addition to the surface collections and
mapping performed on all sites during Phase I, Phase II included hand excavations, additional
mechanical excavations, and geomorphic studies, as well as detailed technological studies of
lithic and ceramic items with the ultimate intent of examining the relationship between
technological organization and mobility.
The archaeological research program at 41EP970 (FB 7520) examined variations in prehistoric
settlement and technological systems from the Early Archaic period to the Formative period (ca.
6000 B.C. to A.D. 1400) in the Jornada Mogollon region. How these increasingly varied and
possibly complex systems were manifested in the archaeological record - particularly by variation
in site structure, the density and diversity of material culture, and technological signatures
denoting increasingly restricted territorial mobility ranges - are central to the current research
program.
ix

The investigations were especially productive and provided comprehensive, integrated, and
analytically productive datasets. Overall, the comparative analysis of site structure and
technology at 41EP970 (FB 7520) provides new insights into the changing settlement and
technological systems from the Early Archaic period into the late Formative period. This study
also revealed that several technological changes occurred during this time interval, in addition to
the adoption of ceramic technology.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The results and success of the archaeological research at three sites in Training Area 1B is due to
the combined efforts of numerous colleagues. First and foremost, the staff of the Fort Bliss
DPW-E, including Sue Sitton, Brian Knight, Shane Offutt, Martha Yduarte, and Keith Landreth,
who supported the excavations and proposed research program. I also appreciated Sue Sitton
coming out to see the sites and assist with excavations for a day. Many thanks go to Shane and
David Winnett for keeping us safe out in the field; their assistance is always greatly appreciated.
Sue Sitton was extremely helpful as the Fort Bliss DPW-E point of contact (POC) for this project.
The field crew consisted of Juan Arias with contributions by Cullom, Amanda Hoiness, Tabitha
Griffith, Megan Lunn, and Ashley Mason. This crew maintained a commendable quality of field
documentation. Craig Mollard provided office and logistical assistance during field and
laboratory work. This report would not have been completed without the great assistance of Mel
Landreth who reviewed and edited this document for content. I would also like to extend thanks
to Lora Jackson Legare, who accessioned the artifacts for curation. Formatting of this report was
completed by Sonia Padilla. She always manages to make the reports look really great. Phil
Dering of Shumla Archaeobotanical Services conducted the flotation analysis.
Another thanks to all the great and fantastic crew of Fort Bliss Project 90-11 (Mauldin et al.
1998) who took impeccable and precise notes. Many thanks to the core group of Mark Bentley,
Bruce Boeke, Mike Fisher, Brian McCuller, Martha Sharp, Sue Sitton, and of course Martha
Yduarte who assisted Raymond Mauldin and me.
Lastly, David Kuehn was extremely helpful with this project and countless others. David Kuehn
was always enthusiastic towards all and without whom many of us would never have had at least
a slight window of understanding of the geomorphology of the basin and relationship of
sediments and archaeological remains. Dave trained and inspired many of us. We will truly miss
David and all he contributed to the archaeological community over the years we were lucky
enough to know and learn from him.
Thank you to all!

INTRODUCTION
In May 2009, Fort Bliss Directorate of Public Works Environmental Division (Fort Bliss DPW­
E) contracted Geo-Marine, Inc., (GMI) to conduct archaeological data recovery at three sites
within Training Area (TA) 1B, in El Paso County, Texas (Figure 1.1). Fieldwork began in
September and continued into November of 2009.
Tim Graves served as Project
Director/Assistant Principal Investigator (API) for the fieldwork and Juan Arias served as crew
chief. Myles Miller served as Principal Investigator (PI). The field crew included Juan Arias and
Tim Graves.
All three of the project sites (41EP970/FB 7520, 41EP5714/FB 12284, and 41EP6301/FB 12245)
were originally tested in 1991 (Mauldin et al. 1998, Fort Bliss Project 90-11). Site 41EP5714
(FB 12284) was revisited and evaluated by Lone Mountain Archaeological Services, Inc.
personnel in 2002 (Church and Stowe 2006:I513-I517).
These previous researchers found that the three project sites contained data that could provide
important information relevant to several prehistoric research domains and recommended them as
eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under Criterion D of 36
CFR 60.4.
As specified in the research design, the work plan for this project included a “phased mitigation”
strategy that apportioned the funding resources and archaeological focus of the project toward the
most productive of the sites designated for data recovery investigation. The project was
performed in two phases. Phase I consisted of the field evaluation and characterization of all
three sites, which included mechanical excavations to determine subsurface potential and
geomorphic integrity, identification and documentation of the quantity, type and location of
surface cultural materials, feature definition, and the surface collection of diagnostic materials on
each site. Phase II consisted of data recovery excavations at only one of the project sites,
41EP970 (FB 7520).
During the initial site characterization in Phase I, two of the project sites were found to have
limited potential to contain sufficient cultural materials that could address the research questions
set forth in the research design for this project. These two sites (41EP5714/FB 12284 and
41EP6301/FB 12245) were campsites with limited surface assemblages and feature remains,
which also lacked a statistically viable sample of artifacts associated with dateable features. In
addition, the mechanical testing performed on these two sites and limited hand excavations during
Phase I revealed that their geomorphic integrity had been compromised. It was determined that
additional excavation at these sites was not warranted; the field and lab time for these two sites
was reallocated toward the more substantial project site, 41EP970 (FB 7520).

Chapter 1. Introduction

This site had the highest potential of the three project sites to provide additional data that could
address the project research questions, and 41EP970 (FB 7520) was mitigated during Phase II of
the project. Phase II included extensive hand excavations, and additional mechanical excavations
and geomorphic studies, as well as laboratory analyses involving detailed technological studies of
chipped-stone, groundstone, and ceramic artifacts, with the ultimate intent of examining the
relationship between technological organization and mobility.
Even though a vast amount of archaeological work has been conducted in the past few decades
within the central basins and in mountain landforms of the north central Jornada Mogollon
region, very little is known regarding the variation in site types and site structures resulting from
different types of social and settlement organization. Whether the thousands of hearth and
artifact scatters that have been recorded across these areas resulted from multifamily settlements
or other types of cooperative social groupings is unclear. Nor is it understood whether different
types of site structures reflect changes in mobility ranges or organizational structures, food
sharing, or any number of variations of regional (or extra regional) social, demographic, and
territorial behavior.
The information gathered during this project contributes to the current knowledge and
understanding of the regional prehistoric adaptations and changing settlement and technological
systems from the Early Archaic period into the Formative period (Mesilla phase).
The following chapter (Chapter 2) is a discussion of the physiographic and natural setting of the
project area, including plant and animal resources, water availability, and raw material sources.
Chapter 3 includes a review of the prehistory of the southern Jornada region, and Chapter 4
presents a detailed discussion of the theoretical context and research perspectives for these
investigations. Chapter 5 provides a summary of the field and laboratory methods. Chapter 6
presents the results of the Phase I field evaluation and characterization of all three project sites, as
well as the Phase II data recovery excavations at 41EP970 (FB 7520). Chapter 7 consists of a
discussion of the analytical results of the data recovery excavations and their relevance to the
research issues outlined in Chapter 4 and a summary of the project.
Several appendices are also provided. Appendix A contains the Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) North American Datum 1927 (NAD 27), NAD 83, and World Geodetic System 1984
(WGS 84) site datum locations as well as the locations of the three sites plotted on United States
Geological Survey (USGS) 1:24,000 scale topographic maps. Appendix B contains backhoe
trench profiles and a summary of the geomorphic investigations at all three project sites.
Appendix C presents radiocarbon dating results, Appendix D contains macrobotanical analyses,
and Appendix E contains all feature data. Appendix F presents the faunal analyses and Appendix
G is a CD that contains the excavation database, which includes GPS locations of these
excavations as well as the location of all features recorded on all three sites investigated, and all
chipped-stone, ceramic, and groundstone artifact analyses.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL SETTING
Myles R. Miller
The following discussions establish the physiographic and environmental context of the project
area, with particular emphasis on the distribution of various subsistence and economically
important resources in the vicinity. These discussions provide an impression of the overall
structure of plant and animal communities, water availability, and lithic raw material sources that
ultimately served as contributing factors to settlement location in the area. The discussions are
restricted to the project area and immediate environs. For a comprehensive overview of resource
structure across greater Fort Bliss, the reader is referred to Miller et al. (2009).
PHYSIOGRAPHY
The region of west Texas that encompasses the project area lies within the Mexican Highlands
section of the Basin and Range physiographic province of the western United States and northern
Mexico (Fennemen 1931; Hawley and Kottlowski 1969; Kottlowski 1958). Hawley (1975)
further subdivides the region around the El Paso, Texas/Las Cruces, New Mexico area into a
Bolson Subsection. In west Texas and southern New Mexico, the Bolson Subsection is
characterized by narrow, roughly parallel, north/south-trending mountain ranges and broad
alluviated interior drainage basins, or bolsons (Hawley 1975; Kottlowski 1958).
Major physiographic landforms of the Bolson Subsection include fault-block mountain chains,
intermontane bolsons, and the Rio Grande Valley (Figure 2.1). The regional bolson landforms
include rock pediments along the flanks of mountains, alluvial fan piedmonts, broad alluvial flats
at the distal toe-slopes of fans, and the interior basin floor of fine-grained alluvial and eolian
sediments.
Playa depressions are another feature of bolson physiography, with fan-margin playas serving as
primary water catchment areas. Smaller playa depressions, or bajos, are distributed throughout
the basin floor along north/south-trending fault-line depressions and associated desert floor
ridges. These physiographic features generally correspond to the four principal landforms found
on Fort Bliss as defined by Satterwhite and Ehlen (1980); mountains, alluvial fans, basins, and
major drainage channels or washes. Elevations of the mountain and basin landforms on Fort
Bliss Military Reservation range from 1,200 m (3,900 ft) above mean sea level (amsl) on the
basin floor to 2,690 m (8,829 ft) amsl in the Organ Mountains.
The local manifestation of these regional intermontane basins, known as the Hueco Bolson,
covers an area measuring 80 km by 25 km, and extends from the Texas-New Mexico border
southward into Chihuahua, Mexico. The Franklin Mountains and Sierra de Juarez bound the

western edge of the bolson and the Hueco and Finlay mountains and Diablo Plateau form its
eastern boundary. The Hueco Bolson and the Tularosa Basin to the north actually form a single
continuous graben basin but the two segments have traditionally been subdivided along a series of
fault escarpments near the Texas/New Mexico border. The Hueco Bolson lacks any prominent
drainage to the Rio Grande; it has trapped and aggraded sediments from the surrounding
mountains since late Pliocene times (Seager 1981).
The current project area is situated in the north central portion of the Hueco Bolson, equidistant
from the Franklin Mountains to the west and the Hueco Mountains to the east. The three project
sites are situated on the basin floor on a broad, north/south-trending, desert floor ridge that is west
of a major fault line depression containing several playas. In the immediate project area, the
terrain is generally comprised of sand dunes of various depths that have been stabilized by
mesquite. The elevation of the project area ranges from 1,216 m (3,990 ft) to 1,222 m (4,010 ft)
amsl.
CLIMATE
The climate of the El Paso area and surrounding Chihuahuan desert is currently a semiarid
mesothermal regime characterized by hot daytime temperatures, relatively cooler nights, and low
humidity. Mean monthly temperatures range from a January low of 44° F to a July high of 83° F,
although summer temperatures often exceed 100° F and freezing temperatures may occur during
the late winter months (Johnson 1997; Office of the State Climatologist 1987). Relative humidity
in the area is quite low, averaging from 10 to 14 percent during the winter and spring, and 22 to
24 percent in the fall months (Ruffner and Blair 1987). The growing season for El Paso,
measured as the average interval between the last killing frost of spring (March 8) and the initial
killing frost of autumn (November 12), is approximately 241 days (Office of the State
Climatologist 1987). However, the agricultural and biomass productivity of the region is
primarily tied to moisture availability rather than growing season temperature.
The average annual rainfall in the area ranges between 8 to 11 inches. Precipitation in the region
comes from two major seasonal movements of air masses (Bomar 1983). Winter moisture is
associated with the southerly deflection of polar Pacific air, which delivers generally prolonged,
low-intensity winter precipitation to the area. During the summer months, beginning at the end of
May and lasting through the middle of October, convective cells are formed by the intersection of
moist tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico with local air masses uplifted by intense surface
heating. The resulting summer precipitation is localized, and generally concentrated in short,
high-intensity thunderstorms in the mid-afternoon and evening, often producing substantial runoff
water in arroyo drainages and standing pools of water in playa depressions.
Over 50 percent of the total annual precipitation in the El Paso area occurs in a three-month
period from July through September, with July being the single wettest month (1.60 inches). A
review of accumulated regional tree-ring data from roughly A.D. 620 revealed major prolonged
droughts have occurred in the region at, or around A.D. 700, A.D. 1000, A.D. 1270, and A.D. 1580
(Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997:53). Minor droughts have also been identified at A.D. 1450, A.D.
1640, A.D. 1730, A.D. 1880, and in the early 1970s (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997:53).
Prevailing winds in the El Paso area are from the north in winter, west-southwest in spring, and
from the south during the summer. Relatively strong winds often accompany steep cold fronts or
frontal storm lines moving across the mountains. Although a year-round occurrence, they reach
their greatest frequency during the climax of the dry season from March to May. Consequently,
spring is the season with the highest mean wind velocities, and when dust storms are most
frequent.

FAUNAL AND FLORAL COMMUNITIES
Modern vegetation in the project area is included within the Chihuahuan Desert Biotic province
and is typical of the Lower Sonoran Life Zone (Shreve 1942). A comprehensive list of flora of
the Fort Bliss region can be found in Miller et al. (2009). Vegetation in the central Hueco Bolson
landform consists of the signature Chihuahuan Desert xerophytic shrub community, which is
predominantly composed of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), creosote bush (Larrea
tridentata), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae, also known as Xanthocephalum
sarothrae). Other common plants in the central Hueco Bolson include four-wing saltbush
(Atriplex canescens), soaptree yucca (Yucca elata), Mormon tea (Ephedra sp.), Cheno-ams,
dropseed grass (Sporobolus sp.), and assorted range grasses, forbs, and seasonal herbaceous
plants. Many local plant taxa have been ethnographically documented as important among
historic Native American groups of the southwest United States and northern Mexico, and were
undoubtedly exploited for food, fuel, and medicinal treatments by the prehistoric inhabitants of
the project area.
While the vegetation of the area appears rather homogeneous to the casual observer, substantial
variation exists across the landscape. Satterwhite and Ehlen (1980) identified 22 distinct plant
associations on Fort Bliss. The depth of local soils and their capacity for water retention, the
proportions of constituent gravels, as well as elevation and exposure, condition these vegetation
communities.
The plant community in the immediate project area is within the mesquite-broom snakeweed
association (Whalen 1978:244). This association contains an abundance of honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa) that “forms sizeable hummocks which gives the land its rolling
appearance” (Whalen 1978:248). Between the hummocks, broom snakeweed (Xanthocephlam
sarothrae), soaptree yucca (Yucca elata), and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) are
plentiful. The site area of one of the project sites, 41EP6301 (FB 12245) had previously been
bulldozed. The area of this site contained many common disturbance plants including mat
sandbur (Cenchrus longispinus), coastal sandbur (Cenchrus spinfex), common sandbur (Cenchrus
incertus) and goat head or puncturevine (Tribulus terrestris).
Several studies have provided evidence of substantial transitions in regional vegetation from
Pleistocene to historic times (Betancourt et al. 1990; Freeman 1972; Hall 1999; Van Devender
1990). These studies have identified cyclical periods of increased and diminished precipitation
that resulted in the expansion of grassland or desert-shrub communities. This phenomenon has
been demonstrated in historic times when overgrazing and drought during the latter part of the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries resulted in severe soil degradation and radically altered
vegetation patterns throughout much of west Texas and southern New Mexico; the most visible
change being the widespread expansion of mesquite-shrub communities (Buffington and Herbel
1965; Dick-Peddie 1975; Gardner 1951; York and Dick-Peddie 1969).
Hall (1999:21) has concluded from pollen analysis of plant macrofossils in the region that modern
shrub vegetation was established in the region by 4000 B.P., but remains in packrat middens
indicate that the modern flora may have been present much earlier. Prehistoric vegetation in the
project area undoubtedly differed from present conditions in some respects, most likely in the
relative proportions of grasses and desert shrubs present across the central basin landform.
A variety of fauna is also present in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, many of which were hunted
and trapped by the prehistoric inhabitants of the region. A comprehensive list of fauna in the Fort
Bliss area can be found in Miller et al. (2009) and Sitton et al. (2005:16). Contemporary animal
species found in the general project area include small lagomorphs (desert cottontails [Sylvilagus
audubonii], jackrabbits [Lepus californicus], and coyote [Canis latrans]), as well as a wide

2-4

Chapter 2. Environmental and Natural Setting

variety of birds, rodents, and reptiles. Some of these animal resources may have provided a
variety of uses for prehistoric peoples, including meat, hide and sinew for clothing and coverings,
bone for tools, and marrow for grease. The project area is also a habitat for numerous and diverse
invertebrates such as ants, beetles, centipedes, and arachnids.
WATER RESOURCES
Permanent water sources are not currently present in the project area. Although springs are
present today and have been historically documented in the Franklin, Organ, San Andres, and
Sacramento mountains, no such reference to springs or seeps in the Hueco Bolson has been
found. Eroded depressions in syenite and limestone outcrops, called huecos (thus the origin of
the name for the local mountains and Hueco Tanks State Park), often held pooled water for some
period of time after a rainfall, providing an intermittent water source at the eastern edge of the
Hueco Bolson.
Whether or not the water sources in the project area were more frequent and stable during
prehistoric times is difficult to ascertain, and the frequency and duration of standing surface water
in the area also cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. However, charred spike rush
(Eleocharis sp.) seeds recovered from two hearth features at the El Arenal site (41EP3175/FB
12650) on Fort Bliss, located east of the project area, may offer an important clue (Miller 2007a).
Spike rush grows only in shoreline environments in the presence of shallow, still, ponded waters,
which suggests the presence of a relatively stable water-filled playa in the vicinity of El Arenal
during occupation of the site. This finding indicates that periods of high precipitation combined
with lower temperatures and reduced evaporation rates must have occurred during some
prehistoric time intervals.
SOIL GEOMORPHOLOGY
Climate change through the late Pleistocene to the Holocene attributed to landscape evolution.
Evidence of the dynamic shifts in climate is contained within geomorphic surfaces on Fort Bliss.
Monger’s previous geomorphic studies (1993), defined in terms of both geologic age and
pedologic development, were built on previous works in the neighboring Desert Project area of
Las Cruces studied by Gile and Grossman (1979) and others. General landforms identified within
the project area were limited to the La Mesa Basin floor and the fault complex. Monger (1993)
describes the La Mesa Basin floor as occupying the Hueco Bolson and contains upper fill
deposits known as the Camp Rice Formation (Strain 1966) of which Gile et al. (1981) attribute an
age-range spanning from the early to middle Pleistocene. Fault scarps, associated linear basins,
and downthrown blocks comprise the fault complex (Monger 1993). Soils related to this
landform are variable in age, thickness, and stages of soil development. Monger (1993) notes that
it is common that the trough-shaped basins contain sequences of buried soils.
The dynamic shifts of climate have not only affected the geomorphic surfaces on Fort Bliss, but
also have contributed to the degree of soil development and erosion. This has resulted in
numerous types of soil profiles. Monger (1993) devised four mapping units to group soils in such
a way to reflect deflational and depositional characteristics. These units include:
•
•
•
•

Mapping Unit 1:
Mapping Unit 2:
Mapping Unit 3:
Mapping Unit 4:

Modern Deflational Surfaces
Dunes with Interdune Sheet Deposits
Depositional Areas Composed of Sand Sheets
Areas Where Soil Strata are Modified Little by Wind

Mapping Units 2 and 3 were identified in the current project area. Mapping Unit 2 is a
combination of historical blowsand in the form of dunes with interdune sheet deposits (Monger
2-5

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

1993). This mapping unit has been subdivided into two units according to dune size. Unit 2a
contains dune sizes greater than 1 m high, and Unit 2b contain dunes less than 1 m in height.
Another way to differentiate these two units is by examining associated vegetation. Unit 2a
dunes usually contain wind ripples indicative of active, moving dunes where interdunal
vegetation is sparse. Contrarily, the smaller dunes of Unit 2b (a transitional unit between 2a and
3) are more stable with common occurrences of interdune grasses (Monger 1993). Mapping Unit
3 contains sheet deposits of historical age, which cover areas that have been deflated and areas
with intact soil stratigraphy (Monger 1993).
GEOLOGY OF THE HUECO AND FRANKLIN MOUNTAINS
In subsequent chapters of this report, considerable attention is given to the lithic raw material
types and the procurement of those materials by prehistoric groups. Such procurement has
important implications for mobility and settlement patterns in the Hueco Bolson. Thus, this
section will provide the background needed to better understand the procurement of the lithic raw
materials based on what was recovered during the present investigations.
Hueco Mountains
The Hueco Mountains are a tilted, north/south-trending, Tertiary uplift block of Paleozoic
sedimentary rocks (Freehling 1976; Hardie 1958). Rock strata of Paleozoic and Precambrian
ages are exposed along the flanks of the mountains, with Paleozoic strata dominant along the
western slopes east the project area (Table 2.1). The exposed flanks of the Hueco Mountains are
predominantly sedimentary in composition, but are underlain by massive intrusive igneous
formations that resulted in the uplift of the Hueco Escarpment (Denison and Hetherington 1969).
Syenite porphyry, an analog of the Red Bluff granite and Thunderbird rhyolite formations of the
Franklin Mountains (Barnes 1983), is part of these massive igneous formations and is exposed in
some locations along the Hueco escarpment, most notably at Hueco Tanks State Park, and a
major unnamed uplift just west of Hueco Tanks. This coarse and durable material was commonly
observed in groundstone assemblages identified at sites located northeast of the project area
(Graves and Ernst 2007).

shale, and siltstone, and provided a convenient source of cherts and fine-grained siltstone

materials for the production of lithic tools (Church et al. 1996). Several lithic procurement sites
have been identified in the foothills of the Hueco Mountains that are 13 km east of the current
project area. These sites consisted of dense surface deposits of tested cobbles and primary
reduction flakes distributed over a hilltop and the upper terraces of foothills (Lukowski et al.
1999: 221-223, 230). Two distinct raw materials, a coarse, tan brown chert or siltstone and a blue
gray chert with white inclusions, were present at those locales. These materials were observed in
the chipped-stone assemblages at the sites investigated during the present project. The tan brown
chert or siltstone was the more common material type of the two, although overall these materials
were few in number in the assemblages identified on the current project sites.
Franklin Mountains
The structural geology of the Franklin Mountains has been described by Harbour (1972), Lovejoy
(1975, 1980), and McAnulty (1967). The Franklin Mountains are a tilted, north/south-trending,
Tertiary fault block of igneous and metamorphic rocks (McAnulty 1967). Rock strata of
Mesozoic, Paleozoic, and Precambrian ages are exposed along the flanks of the mountains (Table
2.2). Mesozoic strata are restricted to the southwestern edge of the range. Later Cenozoic
formations include Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial deposits comprising local fan piedmonts
and the fill of the Hueco Bolson (Harbour 1972).

Precambrian Era

Granite, microgranite, diorite

Paleozoic strata range from the Late Cambrian to Pennsylvanian ages (Lovejoy 1980), and consist
of formations of sedimentary limestones or dolomites. Tabular fragments of sandstone from the
Bliss formation were often used prehistorically for grinding tools, and the few varieties of chert
found in the project area are also derived from these deposits, including the distinctive, blackand-brown banded types found in the Rancheria formation (Loudon and Bowsher 1949).
The Tertiary, Paleozoic, and Precambrian deposits exposed along the eastern flanks of the
mountains are of the greatest significance for the study area in terms of prehistoric resources and
2-7

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

local geomorphic landforms. Rocks from these formations, transported downslope by fluvial and
colluvial processes, form the primary constituents of cobble and gravel deposits found throughout
local alluvial fans and arroyos. These deposits were the primary source of materials exploited
prehistorically for the manufacture of chipped-stone and groundstone tools and ceramic tempers.
The majority of cobbles and gravels comprising alluvial deposits along the alluvial fans west of
the project area are derived from Precambrian and Tertiary rock formations.
The raw material composition of artifact assemblages can be directly linked to the proportions of
these materials in local alluvial deposits, which in turn are determined by their proximity to the
original source outcrops and the erosion drainage patterns contributing to the formation of local
fan piedmonts in the western Hueco Bolson (Miller 1988). Alluvial fans below the northern
slopes of the Franklin Mountains include exposures of the Thunderbird rhyolite group, Lanoria
quartzite, and Red Bluff granites. Consequently, these materials are most commonly represented
in alluvial gravel deposits in this region.
Precambrian rhyolites of the Thunderbird Group are another common material represented in
local alluvial deposits. The Thunderbird Group outcrops form the striking red bands visible along
the central and northern slopes of the Franklin Mountains. These formations were originally
classified as rhyolite porphyries although several distinctive volcanic and sedimentary units are
within the formation.
Metamorphic quartzitic rocks derived from the Lanoria formation are common in local alluvial
fan deposits. The Lanoria formation consists of fine-grained and medium-grained metaquartzites
and quartzitic sandstones composed predominantly of quartz grains (McAnulty 1967). The
formation can be seen as several layers of white, tan, gray, and green strata exposed in the upper
central area of the Franklin Mountains and along the margins of Fusselman Canyon.
Of particular significance for studies of prehistoric ceramic resource procurement are the
extrusive Tertiary granite outcrops present along the eastern mountain slopes. The closest of
these outcrops can be seen as rocky prominences situated along the lower foothills to the
west/northwest of Loop 375. These granites weather easily into clays and quartz-bearing arkosic
sands and, together with angular rhyolite pebbles, are one of the primary sources of the coarse
sands and gravels of local alluvial and bolson deposits (Knowles and Kennedy 1956).
Studies of landscape evolution in the El Paso area are few in number, and have primarily focused
on the alluvial fans and valley-flanking terraces west of the Franklin Mountains (Holliday 1983;
Kottlowski 1958; O'Laughlin 1980; Wilkinson and Carmichael 1985). Nevertheless, local
Quaternary alluvial formations can been correlated with a series of Pleistocene and Holocene
geomorphic surfaces identified along the Organ Mountains, 40 miles to the north (Gile and
Hawley 1968; Gile et al. 1981; Hawley and Kottlowski 1969; Ruhe 1964, 1967). As a group,
these units represent several cycles of Late Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial fan constructions
alternating with periods of general landscape stability and concurrent soil formation. The
correlates of two such geomorphic surfaces, namely the Jornada II and Organ
morphostratigraphic units, can be distinguished in the alluvial fans west of the project area.
The piedmont slope deposits are a correlate of the Organ morphostratigraphic unit formalized by
Gile and Hawley (1968) and Hawley and Kottlowski (1969) along the flanks of the Organ
Mountains north of the project area. These formations represent a period of general landscape
instability and sedimentation occurring along the frontal axes of steep mountain slopes and major
canyons. The Organ surface terminates at a point corresponding to the 4,000-ft contour line as
delineated on the North Franklin Mountain USGS quadrangle. Late Pleistocene Jornada II
surfaces are exposed at higher elevations along the Franklin Mountain piedmont slope.

Chapter 2. Environmental and Natural Setting

Radiocarbon dates for charcoal recovered from the Organ unit near Las Cruces, New Mexico
range from 6,500 to 1,100 year B.P. (Gile and Hawley 1968; Gile et al. 1981; Ruhe 1964, 1967).
The age of the Organ unit in the Las Cruces area generally conforms to radiocarbon dates
obtained from several buried hearths at the Transmountain Campus and Castner Range
archaeological districts. Both districts are situated on the local Organ surface. Radiocarbon dates
from hearth features positioned on or under sheet flood lenses at depths between 30 and 50 cm
below the present ground surface range from circa 2850 to 1450 years B.P. (Hard 1983a:4, 56-59;
O'Laughlin 1979:5). These subsurface hearths are considerably earlier than overlying surface
materials that all postdate the tenth century A.D. Evaluating this information in a broader
spectrum of southwestern geochronological studies (Antevs 1948, 1955; Freeman 1972; Hawley
and Kottlowski 1969; Haynes 1968), O'Laughlin (1979:5, 1980:54-59) suggests that the period of
major alluviation in the El Paso area terminated sometime between the tenth and twelfth centuries
A.D

Radiocarbon dates obtained from deeply buried hearths at the North Hills II site, located west of
the project area and situated along the fan-piedmont slopes of the eastern Franklin Mountains, are
consistent with this chronology. Three hearths, representing an Archaic component dating from
800 to 100 B.C., were present at depths of 40 to 75 cm below the present surface. Hearth features
dating to the Formative period were located near the surface at both North Hills I and II. None
were encountered below this depth, nor were artifacts, charcoal, or stained soils found intermixed
within any isolated cobble lenses. Therefore, Formative period occupations along the fan
piedmont are thought to postdate the period of major alluviation - generally agreed to have
terminated at around A.D. 1000 (Miller 1989; O'Laughlin 1979). No clear stratigraphic breaks
between Archaic and Formative soil horizons have been identified. Instead, continual cycles of
alluvial sedimentation and erosion are indicated by the interbedding and variable depths or
locations of conglomerate stringers and soil strata. However, it is evident that a significant
portion of the Archaic period settlement record along the Franklin Mountain alluvial fans may be
hidden below the surface.
Hueco Bolson
A sample survey to collect lithic raw materials in the central basin was conducted in 1991
(Mauldin et al. 1998:78-79). This survey documented the lithic raw materials within nine
transects providing a 4.5 percent sample. The survey recorded 20,429 lithic raw materials in 150
transect recording units that each measured 100 m in length. The Rio Grande gravels recorded
during the study were generally small (less than 3.0 cm in size) Table 2.3 below demonstrates the
raw material types recorded during the study and is reprinted from Mauldin et al. (1998).
This study indicated that certain material types deposited by the ancestral Rio Grande that flowed
through the region were more prevalent. Organ Mountain rhyolites dominated the assemblage,
which is likely a direct correlation of the fact that the river once flowed through Fillmore Pass
and along the eastern flanks of the Organ Mountain range before trending through the Hueco
Bolson. The 1991 study also reviewed the material types of all site assemblages and found a
preference for the finer grained small materials such as obsidian that originate from northern New
Mexico. The percent of non-utilized obsidian nodules within the overall assemblage was less
than one percent of the raw materials but obsidian comprised 8.6 percent of the chipped stone
artifacts among the 6,748 collected artifacts from the intensively surface collected sites of Fort
Bliss Project 90-11 (Mauldin et al. 1998: 80).

The prehistory of the Jornada Mogollon region encompasses several cultural periods and phases
(Table 3.1). The 10 sites included in this data recovery project contain numerous components
that represent occupations from many of these periods. The following discussion of the cultural
history of the region is adapted and modified from a more comprehensive overview by Miller and
Kenmotsu (2004), and has in large part been presented elsewhere (Lowry et al. 2004).

PRE-CLOVIS TRADITION (~50,000 to 10,000 B.C.)
The existence of pre-Clovis occupations in North America, or a "Pre-Projectile Point Horizon" as
it is occasionally referred to, has been the subject of considerable debate since Alex Krieger first
suggested that pre-Clovis lithic traditions (40,000 to 15,000 B.C.) existed in Texas and elsewhere
throughout the United States (Krieger 1953, 1962, 1964).
Claims of pre-Clovis manifestations in the Jornada Mogollon region continue to create a
substantial amount of controversy (Chrisman et al. 1996; MacNeish 1993a; MacNeish and Libby
2003; MacNeish et al. 1993). MacNeish and Libby (2003) claim that a pre-Clovis occupation
exists based on excavations at Pendejo Cave, a deeply stratified rock shelter located on McGregor
Range east of Orogrande, New Mexico. Zones C1 through O exhibited a well-stratified sequence
of radiocarbon dates ranging between 12,000 and ~50,000 years in age. These strata contained
large quantities of Pleistocene faunal material, well-preserved plant remains, and other eco-facts
that were purportedly in association with hearths, stone artifacts, modified animal bones, human
skin impressions, and human hair.
Middle and Late Holocene occupation of the shelter by human groups is not contested.
Arguments for a human presence in the cave during the Late Pleistocene, prior to 10,000 B.C. and
up to 50,000 years in age, are established on less conclusive findings. Claims of pre-Clovis
occupations have been based primarily on the presence of a small quantity of crudely
manufactured stone artifacts, a very small number of bones with fractures or marks that could be
suggestive of human modification, hearth features constructed of stones differing petrologically
and chemically from the limestone rock formations comprising the natural setting of the cave, and
the presence of hair and skin imprints claimed to be of human origin.
An independent evaluation of the site conducted in 1995 by Fort Bliss archaeologists and Tom
Stafford of the University of Colorado resulted in a revised interpretation of the stratigraphic
sequence. In addition, 15 accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon dates were obtained
from rodent pellets collected from well-documented columns in two exposed profiles in the
shelter. The results of this study have not been reported, but preliminary analyses suggest that the
stratigraphic sequence and assumed integrity of the layered deposits may require substantial
reconsideration (Stafford 1995). Extensive packrat middens are present throughout the shelter
and preliminary results of the radiocarbon dating suggest that the degree of disturbance in the
deposits is greater than previously assumed (Stafford 1995).
If proven that valid cultural occupations exist in the lower strata, such findings would contribute
to a reevaluation of pre-Clovis cultures in North America. The series of independent studies
conducted so far, however, do not support the argument for a Pleistocene human presence in the
region.
PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (10,000 to 6000 B.C.)
The earliest conclusively documented evidence of prehistoric human occupation in the Jornada
region occurs during the Paleo-Indian period. Paleo-Indian adaptations have been viewed as a
tradition of small, highly mobile bands with a subsistence economy centered on hunting large
game animals such as mammoth and bison (Judge 1973). The period is subdivided into three
sequential traditions marked by functional and stylistic differences in tool kits that are thought to
reflect changing hunting and settlement adaptations: the Clovis and Folsom complexes of the
early Paleo-Indian period, and the Plano/Cody complex of the late Paleo-Indian period.
Recognition of Paleo-Indian sites in the Jornada region has been accomplished principally
through cross-dating distinctive lanceolate projectile point forms with those found at
chronometrically dated habitation and kill sites in adjacent regions of the Great Plains. Paleo­
3-2

Chapter 3. Review of the Prehistory of the Southern Jornada Region

Indian culture is represented primarily by isolated finds of projectile points and by a small
number of open-air sites located within the Tularosa Basin and Hueco and Mesilla bolsons.
Substantial numbers of Paleo-Indian artifacts have been documented across the Jornada region;
however, the number pales in comparison with the number of sites from later time periods.
Several sites have been investigated, but few have been fully reported. At the present time, no
absolute chronometric dates have been obtained from contexts or features in secure association
with Paleo-Indian materials in the Jornada. The only radiocarbon dates falling within this period
were obtained from deposits of charred material deeply buried in floodplain alluvium of the Rio
Grande Valley north of Las Cruces, New Mexico. The samples were collected during
geomorphic studies of Quaternary surfaces in the valley (Gile et al. 1981) and the deposits from
which the samples were obtained were not described. Additional early dates have been obtained
from Fresnal Shelter, Burnett Cave, and Hermit Cave in the Sacramento-Guadalupe mountain
chain; although in each case, the association of the date and any human occupation or material
culture remains inconclusive (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
The environment during this time is characteristic of the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition:
moist woodlands and continual stream flow in mountains and other high elevation settings and
standing lakes and marshes throughout the interior basins. Evidence from packrat middens
suggests juniper-oak woodlands along with grassland savannahs in the basins during the early
part of the period. Increasingly drier conditions prevailed until 6000 B.C. when woodlands were
displaced by Chihuahuan, desert scrub communities and large game animals became extinct (Van
Devender 1990).
Early Paleo-Indian - Clovis Complex
Knowledge of Clovis occupation in the Jornada Mogollon region has been obtained almost
entirely through rare isolated finds of the distinctive, fluted, lanceolate projectile points
characteristic of the period. However, few Clovis points and even fewer Clovis sites have been
documented (Meltzer and Bever 1995). Two habitation sites of this period have been reported
from the Jornada Mogollon region. Beckett (1983) notes the presence of Clovis tools mixed with
later Paleo-Indian materials at a site in Rhodes Canyon, located in the southern Tularosa Basin of
New Mexico. Weber and Agogino (1997) reported a substantial Clovis occupation at
Mockingbird Gap in the northern Tularosa Basin. The excavators noted the presence of several
suspected living surfaces; approximately one hundred, whole and partial Clovis points were
recovered during the investigations, as well as a substantive quantity of small mammoth bone
fragments. Otherwise, very few artifacts or occupations attributable to this period have been
recorded during the course of numerous professional archaeological surveys on Fort Bliss and
many other areas of the region; it appears that Clovis manifestations are exceptionally rare within
the Jornada Mogollon region. The nature of Clovis settlement types, hunting and subsistence
adaptations, mobility patterns, or technological organization in the Jornada remain almost entirely
unknown.
Early Paleo-Indian - Folsom Complex
Folsom manifestations in the Jornada region are much better known than their Clovis
predecessors. Numerous Folsom points and occupation sites have been recorded during
archaeological surveys. Although they have been found in many topographic zones, including
mountains, alluvial fans, and plateaus, most Folsom materials have been documented near playa
basins, major and minor drainages, and the margins of the Rio Grande Valley, which may
indicate an adaptation of hunting game animals near water sources. Several excavations of
Folsom components have been undertaken during the past decade, including at a site in Fillmore
Pass on Fort Bliss (Stiger n.d.), Boles Wells in the Tularosa Basin (Mauldin and O’Leary 1994),
3-3

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

and Padre Canyon sites 41HZ504 and 41HZ505 in the Hueco Bolson southeast of El Paso
(Mauldin and Amick 1998; Mauldin and Leach 1997). The nature of Folsom tool forms,
subsistence adaptations, and mobility patterns in the region has also been the subject of serious
investigation (Amick 1994a, 1995, 1996).
Due to the absence of stratigraphically ordered deposits, most Folsom components are mixed with
later occupations, making inferences concerning Folsom technological adaptations tentative.
Most analyses have focused on tool forms and debitage attributes characteristic of the period.
Lithic assemblages typically contain very high proportions of high quality, fine-grained materials
including chert, chalcedony, and obsidian. Raw materials such as nonlocal obsidians, Chuska
Chert, Edwards Plateau Chert, and Alibates Chert (Amick 1994b; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004),
obtained from sources up to 450 km away, have been identified in Folsom assemblages from the
Tularosa Basin and Hueco Bolson. The presence of these materials suggests either long-term
population movements or trade with other groups.
Through the analysis of tool forms and detailed studies of raw material types, important insights
into regional mobility patterns of Paleo-Indian groups and functional aspects of their settlements
are beginning to emerge. The common presence of nonlocal raw materials among discarded tool
assemblages suggests that the tools had been manufactured elsewhere and transported to the sites
in final form. Likewise, debitage collections often consist of predominantly local materials,
indicating that the inhabitants were manufacturing tools, or ‘gearing up’ for the next round of
group movement and hunting forays.
Based upon the distribution of distant and local raw material sources, assemblage content, and the
relative scarcity, but large size, of Folsom components in the Jornada region, Amick (1994a,
1996) has argued that Folsom sites in the region were residential or ‘home base’ localities
oriented toward hunting game animals other than bison. This pattern differs from the Southern
Plains where sites were more logistically organized and oriented towards the hunting of bison.
Unfortunately, the nature of any contemporaneous, supplemental foraging activities of Folsom
hunters within the Jornada region is not well understood.
Late Paleo-Indian - Plano and Cody Complexes
A variety of tool traditions have been recognized for the late Paleo-Indian period and are
collectively referred to as the Plano and Cody complexes (Wheat 1972). Meserve, Golondrina,
Angostura, Eden, and Scottsbluff projectile points characterize the period. Isolated Plano/Cody
projectile points and tools are common in the Hueco Bolson and Tularosa Basin (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004). Plano/Cody components are found in many topographic zones, including
mountains, alluvial fans, and plateaus, but most finds have been documented near playa basins,
major and minor drainages, and the margins of the Rio Grande Valley, which also may indicate
an adaptation of hunting game animals near water sources.
One of the largest Paleo-Indian sites in the region, LA 63880, is located 2 km from a large playa.
The site covers 78,000 square meters and consists of four distinct artifact concentrations and
several diffuse scatters. Transverse end scrapers, side scrapers, and bifaces were common and
projectile point fragments were noted. All of the materials were high-quality cherts. Elyea
(1988) describes the site as a base camp rather than a kill site because most tools were worn or
reshaped, suggesting extractive tasks. Based on the low diversity of tool forms and presence of
low-density artifact clusters, Elyea (1988) suggests the site was the subject of repeated
occupations.
Environmental changes during the Early Holocene brought about several changes in human
adaptation at the close of the Paleo-Indian period. The persistent drying trend continued, with a
resultant demise of large game mammals, expansion of plant communities adapted to drier
3-4

Chapter 3. Review of the Prehistory of the Southern Jornada Region

conditions, and constriction of perennial water sources. These changes undoubtedly contributed
to large-scale changes in subsistence strategies, requiring a diversification of the Paleo-Indian
subsistence base, with a greater focus on exploitation of plant foods. Such changes, and
accompanying shifts in settlement and technology, mark the onset of the Archaic period at circa
6000 B.C.
ARCHAIC PERIOD (6000 B.C. to A.D. 200/400)
The Archaic period represents the longest span of human occupation within the Jornada region.
This period is better represented archaeologically than the Paleo-Indian period, with an
impressive array of evidence from rock shelters and open sites found in all environmental zones.
Notable developments during the Archaic period include the first archaeological evidence for
agriculture, the habitation of residential pit house or hut structures, and the widespread use of
rock or caliche in the construction and use of thermal features. An increase in the range of plant
materials utilized, as well as technological changes reflecting the processing of these foods,
indicate a greater diversification of subsistence practices over the preceding Paleo-Indian period.
The Archaic period is characterized as an adaptation based on seasonally mobile, broad-spectrum
hunting and gathering; this characterization is based on data from surveys in the Hueco Bolson
and Tularosa Basin (Carmichael 1986; Whalen 1977, 1978), excavations at cave locales
(Cosgrove 1947), and open-air site excavations (Fields and Girard 1983; Mauldin et al. 1998;
O'Laughlin 1980). Population is thought to have increased throughout the period, leading to
increasingly restricted home-range territories, and ultimately, the adoption of agriculture (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004).
The 6000-year interval of the Archaic period has been conventionally divided into Early (6000 to
4000/3000 B.C.), Middle (4000/3000 to 1200 B.C.), and Late (1200 B.C. to A.D. 200) subperiods
that have been defined on the basis on projectile point styles and stratigraphic data from rock
shelters.
Early Archaic (6000 to 4000/3000 B.C.)
The Early Archaic is one of the least understood time periods of the entire Jornada prehistoric
sequence. Early Archaic occupations have been defined primarily based on projectile point styles
and a few insubstantial deposits or features. The overall number of projectile points does not
greatly outnumber those of the preceding Paleo-Indian period. Few firmly dated Early Archaic
contexts have been identified in the Jornada, and have primarily involved deeply buried features
or rock shelter deposits. However, these deposits have yielded little data concerning subsistence,
settlement, and technology (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Projectile technology emphasizes a change from the lanceolate forms of the preceding PaleoIndian period to stemmed forms such as Jay, Bajada, and Uvalde. Along with the adoption of
these stemmed projectile point forms came a noticeable change in the use of coarser-grained raw
materials for the manufacture of projectiles. Additional technological changes include the
utilization of rock or caliche for heating elements in thermal features and the use of ground stone.
The factors causing such changes are still unknown, although, they may be related to changes in
prey selection and hunting practices, restricted home ranges that caused an increase in local raw
material use, reduced emphasis on tool maintenance and an increase in tool reliability, or a
combination of these factors. Though speculative, the settlement and subsistence of the Early
Archaic can be characterized by an absence of structures, use of larger burned-rock features on
the alluvial fans and other hearth features in all environmental zones, use of artifacts, and changes
in projectile point technology and raw material utilization. These data suggest an adaptation of
seasonally mobile, small band hunter-gatherers (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

Middle Archaic (4000/3000 to 1200 B.C.)
Fundamental subsistence, settlement, and technological adaptations established in the Early
Archaic tend to be maintained through the Middle Archaic, although, they may have become
intensified throughout the latter part of this 2,000-year-long interval. This inferred intensification
of subsistence and settlement adaptations is based on an overall increase in the number of sites
and an increase in feature use based on a significant increase in the number of radiocarbon dates
available for this period. Fifty-one radiocarbon dates are known from sites of this time period in
the Jornada area; the majority of these are from open sites located in the central Hueco Bolson,
Tularosa Basin, and Mesilla Bolson. Middle Archaic sites also tend to be found along drainages,
are generally larger, and contain more features than Early Archaic sites. Such sites also have
more substantial artifact assemblages and clustered radiocarbon dates suggestive of larger social
groups (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Recently, several Middle Archaic occupations have been identified at 41EP155 along the Rio
Grande Valley terrace in east El Paso (Willis and Peterson 2003), at several sites near Old Coe
Lake Playa (Lowry et al. 2003), and at the Orogrande Site I on alluvial fan toe slopes of the
Jarilla Mountains (Railey 2002). The topographic setting of these sites indicates some Middle
Archaic settlements were tethered to permanent and semi permanent water sources and others
were not.
House structures are noted for the first time in the Middle Archaic. House structures were found
at Keystone Dam (O’Laughlin 1980), which has an occupation spanning the period between
2500-1800 B.C. These were small, shallow brush structures or "huts", as termed by Carmichael
(1985), Hard (1983a), and Miller and Kenmotsu (2004). They are shallow (15 to 20 cm), circular
(less than 2-square meters), and have unprepared floors and few internal features, suggesting
short-term occupation. The presence of thermal features and ground stone artifacts at Middle
Archaic sites suggests a focus on plant foods in addition to hunting.
Late Archaic (1200 B.C. to A.D. 200/400)
In terms of settlement, subsistence, and technological adaptations, the Late Archaic - particularly
the latter half of the period - represents a true break in the long Archaic sequence of the previous
4,000 years.
Several technological innovations and changes in settlement adaptations
characteristic of this period presage developments during the Formative period.
An important aspect of Late Archaic settlement is the dramatic increase in sites, features, and
material culture attributable to this period. Basin landforms experience a peak in intensity of use,
although, Late Archaic sites are found in all environmental zones. The diversity and quantity of
artifacts increases greatly compared to preceding periods. The presence of such items as nets,
basketry, atlatls, wood implements, and hide containers is common. Small circular structures are
also common during this period.
Hunting is still a very important subsistence factor, with rockshelter locations near, or in, the
mountains containing sizeable amounts of large mammal bone (e.g., deer), while other locales are
dominated by rabbit species (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Projectile points change to cornernotched and side-notched forms in the latter half of this subperiod. They also become
significantly smaller (marking the introduction of the bow and arrow).
Among the most important developments during the Late Archaic in the Jornada region is the
first conclusive evidence for the use of cultigens. Upham and MacNeish (1993) date the
inception of cultigens at 2500 B.C. based on corn pollen found at Keystone Dam (O’Laughlin
1980). This date should be considered provisional due to the poor preservation of the pollen and
the wide range of 14C dates for the same strata. More conclusive evidence of cultigens comes
3-6

Chapter 3. Review of the Prehistory of the Southern Jornada Region

from Tornillo Shelter (Upham et al. 1987) where a date of 2030-830 B.C. was recovered from
corn, and from Fresnal Shelter (Tagg 1996), which yielded a suite of dates ranging from 1390­
940 B.C. to 1200 B.C.-A.D. 600; beans were dated to ca. 350 B.C.
Cultigen dates from Fresnal and other sites correspond with other early corn dates in the greater
Southwest (ca. 1050-850 B.C.), including southern New Mexico (Tagg 1996; Wills 1988),
southern Arizona (Fish et al. 1986; Matson 1991; Minnis 1992), and northern Chihuahua (Hard
and Roney 1998; Wills 1988). The causal factors for the adoption of cultigens are still poorly
understood. The prevailing view in the Jornada Mogollon region is that domesticates were part of
a large and diverse subsistence base during the Late Archaic and that its addition provided a
stable and predictable resource (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Measures of agricultural
dependence provide contradictory data, with rock shelters containing abundant evidence of
cultigens, while open sites contain none. Analyses of N14/N15 and C13/C12 ratios on human
bones indicate no evidence of a high maize diet. The apparent difference in rock shelter versus
open sites may be a function of preservation, or may be due to seasonal differences in site
occupation.
Because the causal factors underlying the adoption of corn, beans, and other cultigens during the
Late Archaic period are not well known, the origins of agriculture in the Jornada Mogollon region
are best viewed within the larger perspective of developments across the Southwest. Many view
the use of cultigens as part of an increasing diversification of plant foods exploited during Late
Archaic times, one that also provided additional stability, buffering, and/or predictability to the
subsistence base (Matson 1991; Minnis 1992; Wills 1988). Whether or not this process may have
been a cause or effect of increasing population levels, and in turn, reduced territories available for
population movements, is not well understood.
General Trends of the Archaic Period
A general correlation exists between the appearance of cultigens and an increase in the number of
radiocarbon-dated contexts that could suggest a linkage between changing demographic patterns
and the adoption of cultigens. Whether the appearance of cultigens is a cause or effect of
increasing population levels and/or land use intensity as represented by much higher numbers of
dated features and components is uncertain. Projectile technologies undergo several drastic
modifications during the latter half of the Late Archaic and early part of the Formative period.
These include the shift to corner-notched and side-notched forms, a significant decrease in size,
and a much-reduced emphasis on blade modifications. An increase in the use of locally abundant
raw materials for manufacture of projectiles also takes place during this time.
The design and raw material characteristics of these projectile points reflect less intensive
maintenance and reduced durability or versatility. When considered in light of the dramatic
increase in the numbers of radiocarbon-dated thermal features and structures present across
several environmental zones, these changes in projectile technology indicate a more intensive
land-use pattern and a concomitant decrease in either group mobility, in terms of the number and
duration of group moves across the landscape, or perhaps a reduction in territorial ranges
available for exploitation by Late Archaic populations that resulted in a more intensive use of
smaller areas.
A critical research question is whether increasing levels of feature construction, changes in
projectile technology, and occupational intensity represent population growth within the Jornada
region, or reflect extraregional population factors resulting in reduced territorial ranges available
for exploitation. That is, population growth per se may not have occurred, but instead increased
intensification of land use within the region, resulting from increasingly restricted territorial
ranges, took place while population levels may have remained relatively stable. Pronounced
3-7

changes in regional territories and dynamics occurred during, and particularly near the end of, the
Archaic period (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
At a more restrictive spatial scale, or site level perspective, these regional changes should also
have influenced patterns of resource exploitation and land use, as well as various modes of social
organization. Such trends and transitions should be evident in the archaeological record via
changing site layouts and occupational histories.
FORMATIVE PERIOD (A.D. 200/400 to 1450)
The Formative period encompasses several important transitions in settlement adaptations. These
include a relatively rapid succession of changes in architectural form, settlement structure,
subsistence, and technology, including a trend of decreasing mobility coupled with increasing
agricultural dependence and specialization that culminated in puebloan occupations between A.D.
1300 to 1450. These developments have almost universally been perceived in terms of increasing
agricultural dependence. However, evidence from the Jornada region also suggests that
prehistoric populations may have become more agriculturally specialized between A.D. 1300 to
1450.
The Formative period sequence has recently been revised (Miller 2005) and now includes four
subperiods: the Mesilla phase (A.D. 200/400 to 1000), the early Doña Ana phase (A.D. 1000 to
1150), the late Doña Ana phase (A.D. 1150 to 1300), and the El Paso phase (A.D. 1300 to 1450).
In the following discussion, normative characteristics of each phase are presented first, followed
by a more detailed review of specific adaptive trends that occurred throughout the Formative
period. It should be noted that in many instances, adaptive trends crosscut phase boundaries and
that the phase system often masks such variability in the archaeological record.
Mesilla Phase (A.D. 200/400 to 1000)
The Mesilla phase is characterized by the appearance of the El Paso brownware ceramic tradition
with Alma plain as a rare intrusive ware. Other intrusive ceramics (predominantly Mimbres
white wares and other Mogollon wares) appeared in the region after A.D. 600, but were not
common. Painted pottery (El Paso Bichrome) also made its first appearance late in this phase.
Pit houses were constructed during this period (Lehmer 1948), but were generally similar to the
huts of the Archaic period (Hard 1983a). Structures become increasingly formal after A.D. 600.
Sites generally are larger and more numerous, and contain more artifacts than sites from the
earlier Archaic period.
Whalen (1977, 1978, and 1994) uses survey data for the region to propose a site typology based
on site size, number of features, and the presence of ceramics, chipped stone, and ground stone.
Though the characteristics change through time, Whalen (1994) suggests that artifact variety and
site size distinguish residential sites from camps. Mesilla phase sites for all environmental zones
show a slight association between sites and playas in the central basin. Because all types of sites
are found in all zones, Whalen (1994) believes that the subsistence practices of the Mesilla phase
were based primarily on hunting and foraging supplemented by agriculture and that occupation of
the bolson was residential in nature.
Other archaeologists see the Mesilla phase as a continuation of the subsistence and settlement
practices of the Late Archaic (Carmichael 1986; Hard 1983b; O'Laughlin 1979, 1980).
Carmichael's (1986) work in the area differs in some respects from Whalen's (1994), especially in
defining the role of the Hueco Bolson in cultural development. Carmichael (1986) believes that
the basins of the region could not have been the whole area utilized by prehistoric groups. These
basin areas were nonresidential in nature rather than being used by sedentary peoples.
3-8

Chapter 3. Review of the Prehistory of the Southern Jornada Region

Residential sites were probably located outside of the basins, most likely near the Rio Grande,
and were defined as sites containing trash middens.
Hard (1983b) proposes a settlement-subsistence model in which differences in environment
influence choices for seasonal rounds and activities. Hard (1983b) believes that winter and spring
sites were located on the mountain alluvial fans, while the central basin was used for foraging.
The summer and fall seasons saw the central basin used for temporary residences. More recent
work by Mauldin et al. (1998) suggests that Mesilla phase peoples may be characterized as
residential foragers. The central basin and alluvial fans are thought to have been components in a
residential foraging strategy in which groups lived throughout the region as hunter-gatherers.
After A.D. 600, feature-related activities in the central basin drastically decreased. Mauldin and
others (1998) believe that this may indicate a shift in the settlement and subsistence practices of
prehistoric groups to a less intensive, logistical use of the central basin.
In summary, research by Carmichael (1986), Hard (1983b), and Whalen (1994) characterizes the
Mesilla phase population as increasing over the previous Archaic period, utilizing all
environmental zones, and showing trends toward sedentism. Pottery was introduced, and may
have been important for cooking and storage of wild plant resources as well as cultigens. Ground
stone inventories indicate increasing use during this phase. Settlement is thought to have been
seasonal, with huts utilized as summer abodes and deeper pit houses used as winter residences.
Subsistence was based on generalized hunting (rabbits and small game) and the foraging of wild
plant resources. Early in this phase agriculture may have been more opportunistic, with
increasing reliance coming later in order to offset environmental variability that increased the risk
of not having enough food to survive the winter (Wills 1988).
Early and Late Doña Ana Phases (A.D. 1000 to 1150 [Early] and A.D. 1150 to 1300 [Late])
The Doña Ana phase was originally defined by Lehmer (1948) and was further characterized by
Carmichael (1986). Doña Ana phase sites, as defined by Lehmer (1948), are characterized by the
presence of El Paso Bichrome and El Paso Polychrome pottery associated with adobe surface
construction. Debate continues about the ability to distinguish Doña Ana phase occupations
within the archaeological record (see Carmichael 1985, 1986; Hard et al. 1994; Mauldin 1993;
Mauldin et al. 1998; Miller 1989, 1990).
Early Doña Ana phase occupations have been described at the Gobernadora, Ojasen, and North
Hills sites (Miller 1989, 1990; Shafer et al. 1999). These sites have informal pit houses and
burned-rock activity areas. Scarborough (1986) excavated a late Doña Ana phase, pit house
village. Data from this site indicate the use of deep, square-shaped formal pit houses and the
utilization of discrete trash middens, suggesting a more sedentary existence than earlier time
periods. Cultigens such as corn, squash, and beans were recovered, as well as large amounts of
rabbit bone.
One other site from this period has been excavated in the region (Kegley 1980). The site
contained evidence of formal pit structures with plastered hearths, as well as evidence for
changing social organization defined by the presence of a very large pit structure, believed to be a
communal house. Research by Whalen (1977, 1978, 1981) indicates that this period (which he
defined as the Transitional Pueblo period) is characterized by increasing population levels and a
shift of settlement areas to runoff zones located on lower alluvial fans of the Franklin, Hueco, and
Organ mountains.
Overall, the changes that occurred during the Doña Ana phase include the introduction of
polychrome pottery, rapid population increase, artifact changes that included larger manos and
metates, decreased projectile point sizes with larger forms still in use, and changes in intrusive
ceramic types from Mimbres to Chupadero and Chihuahuan wares. The increasingly formal pit
3-9

structures eventually led to later pueblo architecture of the El Paso phase. Another crucial change
that occurred during this time was the shift from a general use of all areas within the region to
concentrated use of specific environmental zones. These areas included the Rio Grande and the
distal alluvial fans of local mountain ranges (transition zone) that are notable for their abundance
of water and arable land for growing cultigens.
El Paso Phase (A.D. 1300 to 1450)
The final and most intensive prehistoric use of the region occurred during the El Paso phase (also
referred to as the Pueblo period). This phase is characterized by an increase in the number of
large and small residential sites, increased artifact densities, and a clustered settlement pattern
(Carmichael 1986; Whalen 1977, 1978), as well as the introduction of small triangular projectile
point forms. Larger projectile point styles are regularly found on the floors of rooms, indicating
the possible continuing use of the atlatl in conjunction with the bow and arrow.
Several excavated El Paso phase sites provide data on subsistence and settlement. Varied
settlement patterns and different structure types are suggested by data from Hot Well Pueblo, a
100-plus room village located near the eastern edge of the Hueco Bolson (Bentley 1993; Brook
1970; Lowry 2005); La Cabrana, a small pueblo located near the Rio Grande (Bradley 1983);
Firecracker Pueblo (O'Laughlin 2001), located on the alluvial fans of the Franklin Mountains; and
other pueblos throughout the region (Brook 1980; Gerald 1988; Lehmer 1948). In addition,
individual surface room structures are a common feature of El Paso phase settlements (Batcho et
al. 1985; Browning et al. 1992; Dering et al. 2001).
Hueco Bolson survey data outline important changes that occurred during the El Paso phase.
Whalen (1977, 1978, 1980), who documented a cluster of large sites along the alluvial fans of the
Franklin and Hueco mountains, suggests that a shift in settlement patterns from earlier phases
may indicate increased use of the lower alluvial fans for farming activities. Carmichael (1986)
documented similar areas in the northern Hueco Bolson that he suggests were established during
the Doña Ana phase. He argues that the sites are part of a larger regional exchange network
related to Casas Grandes in Mexico (Carmichael 1986).
Mauldin (1986) developed a settlement-subsistence model for the El Paso phase based on Hard's
(1983a) work with the Mesilla phase, but assumed more dependence on agriculture. Mauldin
(1986) suggests a division between primary villages and secondary villages. Primary village
locations were near reliable water sources on mountain slopes but populations and intensity of use
fluctuated during the year. Subsistence at these sites was based primarily on agriculture.
Secondary villages, which were located on both mountain slopes and in the central basin near
playas, were associated with late summer residential occupations based on hunting and foraging.
Small sites (e.g., campsites and limited activity sites) were not included in this, or other models of
settlement and subsistence for the region. The debate over the role of agriculture and its
importance to subsistence for this period is unresolved, as is the degree of sedentism.
Thus, the El Paso phase is characterized by peak population levels, diverse artifact assemblages,
use of pit structures, individual surface rooms, above-ground pueblos, and dependence on
agriculture, but not to the exclusion of hunting and foraging. Residential permanency at sites
during wet years and seasonal movement during periods of dryness or lean years is postulated.
Alternatively, a seasonal sedentary lifestyle alternating between the desert floor, alluvial fan, and
riverine habitation may have been the norm.
Adaptive Trends of the Formative Period
As noted by several researchers (Anschuetz 1990; Carmichael 1981, 1984, 1985, 1986; Mauldin
et al. 1998; Seaman et al. 1988; Whalen 1994), the Formative period phase sequence has been
3-10

Chapter 3. Review of the Prehistory of the Southern Jornada Region

based primarily on normative trait lists. Miller and Kenmotsu (2004) provide a more recent
review of technological and adaptive trends that occurred during the Formative period. Many
important changes occurred during this time, including changes in architectural form, settlement
and land use, subsistence, and technology.
Architecture and Settlement
Several important architectural trends and transitions occurred during the Formative period,
beginning with habitation primarily in informally constructed huts and pit houses, then to more
formally constructed aboveground rooms, and ultimately the joining of rooms to form contiguous
room blocks, or pueblos. These changes are thought to be related to decreasing mobility and
increasing agricultural specialization. Recent studies of Jornada Mogollon architecture (Lowry
and Bentley 1997; Miller 1997) suggest four types of structures were present in the region:
informal hut structures, pit houses, individual surface rooms, and pueblo room blocks.
Along with the changes in architectural form, changes in site structure (or settlement structure)
also occurred. Mesilla phase and Early Doña Ana phase settlements often have centrally located
residential areas with two or more huts or pit houses surrounded by activity areas containing
hearths, fire-cracked rock features, pits, and middens. Late Doña Ana phase, pithouse sites, and
El Paso phase pueblo sites appear to have increasingly formalized trash disposal areas rather than
the sheet middens common at earlier sites. Miller (1997) notes the presence of fire-cracked rock
features at Doña Ana phase sites that date later than structures, indicating continued logistical
occupations after the abandonment of residences. Later pueblo room blocks are typically
arranged in a linear fashion, although plaza-style arrangements have been noted. At least one
large room is present at each pueblo site, suggesting communal activities. Large numbers of
extramural features are present including hearths, fire-cracked rock features, trash pits, and
possible storage features. The presence of individual surface rooms during this time may
represent a little-known aspect of Formative period settlement (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Settlement and Land Use
The distribution of features and structures among different topographic and environmental zones
of the Jornada indicates an increase in agricultural dependence and a concomitant decrease in
mobility during certain times of the year. The Mesilla phase is characterized as a dispersed
settlement system with occupations occurring throughout all landforms. Doña Ana phase
settlement becomes more restricted, with most sites occurring on the alluvial fans; and later El
Paso phase settlements are focused on playas and lower alluvial fan areas. Little is known of
prehistoric riverine settlements in the region due to the alteration of the valley floor after the
construction of a lake and dam upstream at Elephant Butte in 1905. This allowed for formalized
farming and irrigation and/or modern urban development along the margins of the Rio Grande
Valley and resulted in poor preservation.
Radiocarbon dates of various feature types indicate an increased construction and use of all
feature types and an increased use of all landforms between A.D. 200 to 650; residential sites
become common in the central basin and on alluvial fans between A.D. 650 to 1000. After A.D.
1000, use of the central basin decrease dramatically (based on the number of recorded features)
while alluvial fan occupation increases, a trend that coincides with the decrease of hut structures
and increase in square pit houses during the same period. Around A.D. 1150, occupation of the
alluvial fan is at its zenith while playa areas are also increasingly occupied; this correlates with
the increase in isolated pit rooms identified in the archeological record. Finally, between A.D.
1275 and 1450, human use of the central basin and alluvial fans decreases dramatically; playa
areas exhibit an increase in utilization and pueblo architecture becomes common (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004). Thus, the settlement system goes from a dispersed, generalized use of the
landscape during the early Formative period (A.D. 200/400 to 1000) to an increasingly
3-11

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

concentrated system that maximizes specific environmental zones in the late Formative period
(A.D. 1000 to 1450). The overlap in settlement use between the alluvial fans and playas during
the late Formative suggests a dual residential settlement system where different activities were
being conducted in different environmental settings.
Subsistence
The most significant change in subsistence during the Formative period is the intensification of
agricultural production. As with most regions of the Southwest, corn (Zea mays) represents the
most common and important cultigen. Other important cultigens include beans (Phaseolus sp.),
squash (Cucurbita sp.), and to a lesser extent, a variety of bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria).
The Mesilla phase has been characterized as a time of low reliance on cultigens; few remains of
cultivated plants have been recovered from these contexts while wild plant remains dominate.
Doña Ana phase sites mirror those of the Mesilla phase, although some increase in the use of
cultigens has been noted. El Paso phase sites contain large amounts of cultivated plant remains,
including corn and beans, suggesting an overall increase in and dependence on agricultural
production. Miller (1990, 1997, and 2002) analyzed macro botanical remains from several
Formative period sites and calculated ubiquity values for various cultigens and wild plant species.
The results of these analyses suggest an overall increase in corn production between A.D. 1150
and 1300, with an increase use of beans evident after A.D. 1150. Equally important is the
observation that ubiquity values for cacti, succulents, and other nondomesticated plants increase
steadily between A.D. 400 to 1300, but fall to less than 10 percent for El Paso phase settlements.
This pattern is also reflected by the regional decline of the use of rock-lined pits or other thermal
facilities (presumably used to process these plant foods) after A.D. 1300. These patterns suggest
that exploitation of these food resources may have intensified during the latter part of the Doña
Ana phase, but decreased as agricultural dependence - or perhaps more appropriately agricultural
specialization – increased (Miller 2002; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Additional evidence of the increasing use of cultigens during the Formative period comes from
analyses of stable isotope ratios on skeletal materials. MacNeish and Marino (1993) suggest
increasing dependence on corn occurs throughout the Formative period, with a peak in the El
Paso phase and a steady decline afterwards. Faunal data, though scarce, suggest a reliance
primarily on rabbit, with few large mammal remains represented in assemblages. Interestingly,
fish has also been documented at La Cabrana, a riverine pueblo located north of El Paso (Bradley
1983) and at a Doña Ana village site just north of La Cabrana (Carmichael personnel
communication).
Some evidence contrary to the increasing reliance on domesticated plants during the Formative
period has been recently documented. Burned rock midden and ring midden features east and
southeast of the Hueco Bolson and burned rock features on alluvial fans of the Franklin
Mountains have been identified that date to the El Paso phase (Kutzko et al. 2003 and Willis et al.
2002). The presence of burned rock thermal features associated with specialized plant processing
that date to the El Paso phase and are located in alluvial fan settings could be indicators of some
need or continued reliance on subsistence items that occur in these settings. In addition, some
small thermal features in the central basin date to the El Paso phase (Graves and Ernst 2007),
indicating some continuing use of that topographic zone as well.
Technology
Sequential changes in architectural form and site structure, settlement patterns, and subsistence
economies during the Formative period are also reflected in the many aspects of the material
culture of the Jornada region. Several changes in technological adaptations also occurred during
this period, including the introduction of ceramics and changes in ground stone, thermal features,
and storage features.
3-12

Chapter 3. Review of the Prehistory of the Southern Jornada Region

In an analysis of radiocarbon date distributions among various types of thermal features, Miller
(1997 and 2002) found that the construction and use of thermal features peaked prior to A.D. 650
and declined until A.D. 1000. Larger features are more common in the archeological record
during the El Paso phase, while the number of rock-lined features increases after A.D. 1000 and
peaks at A.D. 1150 to 1300. One of the most important findings is that the number of burned-rock
thermal features recorded severely decline after A.D. 1300. An increase in the number pits and
trash midden features after A.D. 1150 (Miller 1997) suggests the use of formal trash deposits in
later sites and indicates changes in trash disposal practices from the earlier use of undefined sheet
middens.
The correspondence of changes in the numbers of thermal features and storage pits, coupled with
increasingly formal architecture suggest a major shift in subsistence and subsistence practices.
The current data indicate an increase in the use of cacti during the Doña Ana phase, along with an
increase in formalized housing and storage. After A.D. 1300, the use of cacti and all thermal
features decline drastically; suggesting subsistence practices became increasingly oriented
towards cultigens and agricultural specialization (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
These patterns are also reflected by changes in regional technologies. Analysis of ground stone
assemblages by Hard et al. (1996) identified an overall increase in mano size and increasing use
of trough metates and a decrease in the use of slab metates during the El Paso phase. These
patterns are thought to reflect the more intensive requirements of corn processing. Ceramics,
which make their appearance in the Mesilla phase, remain unchanged through most of the phase.
Around A.D. 1000, the El Paso brownware tradition undergoes significant changes with the
introduction of painted wares (El Paso Bichrome and Polychrome).
The long-lived El Paso Brown type disappears during the later Formative period. Neckless jars,
which were common during the Mesilla phase, decrease in use in the El Paso phase, and by A.D.
1250-1300, neckless jars disappear. Necked jars increase in use in the El Paso phase. An
analysis of ceramic rims by Miller (1997) indicates that Mesilla and Doña Ana phase sites have
highly variable vessel forms, while later sites have very similar vessel types in their assemblages.
Miller (1997) suggests that this is due to a greater range of functional and seasonal occupations
and a generalized subsistence economy by more mobile peoples for earlier periods, and more
uniform vessel functions and less mobile adaptations for the El Paso phase (Miller 1997).
Chipped-stone studies have lagged behind other artifact classes in terms of their ability to provide
corroborative data on changing adaptations. What little data there are suggest little change in raw
material procurement and reductive technologies. Informal core reduction and flake tool
production dominates throughout the Formative period. Some increase in the use of obsidian is
noted in the El Paso phase, but this may be due to shifts in settlement locations where obsidian
nodules were more common.

THEORETICAL CONTEXT AND RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES
Myles Miller
The following chapter presents the theoretical context and research perspectives for the
archaeological investigations conducted during this project. The research design incorporated
issues of technological organization, the spatial and social organization of hunter-gatherer and
agriculturalist settlements, and larger issues of settlement organization (mobility and territoriality)
among prehistoric hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists of the Jornada region. The work plan
ensured that sufficient data was recovered to allow for the evaluation of research questions
developed along these themes, as well as meeting the requirements of the Programmatic
Agreement signed by the Advisory Council, the New Mexico and Texas State Historic
Preservation Offices, and Fort Bliss, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, and
the mitigation of adverse effects to historic properties as defined in 36 CFR 800.
To ensure that the data needed to address the research questions could be obtained, the research
design contained a two-phased mitigation that apportioned the funding resources and
archaeological focus of the project to the most productive subset of sites designated for data
recovery investigations. Initial investigations conducted under the two-phased approach
determined that two of the three project sites did not have sufficient potential to yield information
to address the project research questions and the time and budget allotments were reallocated
toward the remaining more productive project site, 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Originally, the overarching research topic for the project addressed the increasing complexity of
prehistoric settlement and technological systems spanning the Late Archaic period (ca. 1200 B.C.
to A.D. 200/400) through the Mesilla phase of the Formative period (A.D. 200/400 to 1000). This
was based on previous radiocarbon dates and diagnostic artifacts identified on the three sites
listed in the Statement of Work (SOW). The original research topic regarding settlement and
technological systems from the Late Archaic through the early Formative period was expanded to
include the entire span of Archaic period (6000 B.C. to A.D. 200/400) and the Formative period
(A.D. 200/400 to 1450). How these increasingly complex prehistoric settlement and technological
systems were manifested in the archaeological record of the project area - particularly by
variation in site structure, the density and diversity of material culture, and technological
signatures denoting increasingly restricted territorial mobility ranges - were central to the present
research program.
RESEARCH DOMAINS
The design of the mitigation program developed by GMI for this project involved an approach
that is different from most recent studies of hunter-gatherer settlements in the central Hueco
Bolson and Tularosa Basin. Due consideration is given to current cultural ecological and
behavioral ecological theory and analytical method. However, GMI focused more intensively on
4-1

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

issues of site structure, site formation, and inferences of settlement function derived thereof. In
addition, a specific focus on chipped-stone technological organization was adopted. GMI also
considered the archaeological remains in the project area within a wider regional perspective,
viewing demographic and settlement changes within and among the sites as reflecting broader
developments in pan-regional social and territorial networks (see McBrinn 2005) through the
Archaic and early Formative periods.
Accordingly, the current project proposed an approach that focused on patterns of site formation
and site structure and then examined related issues of technological organization and regional
mobility. The presence of residential sites with structures and ceramics and sites consisting of
both isolated and clustered hearths offered a range of site layouts that would be used to evaluate
differing forms of settlement mobility, occupational history, and social arrangements
GMI’s overarching research topic addresses the increasing complexity of prehistoric settlement
and technological systems through the Archaic period (ca. 6000 B.C. to A.D. 200/400) and Mesilla
phase (A.D. 200/400 to 1000) of the Formative period, since these periods are by far the most
common in the central Hueco and Tularosa basins. How these increasingly complex systems
were manifested in the archaeological record of the project area - particularly by variation in site
structure, the density and diversity of material culture, and technological signatures denoting
increasingly restricted territorial mobility ranges – were central to the present research program.
Studies of radiocarbon age distributions among various technologies and landscape components
demonstrate that several technological and settlement changes beyond the mere adoption of
ceramic technology occurred during the Late Archaic period and Mesilla phase transition
(Mauldin 1995, 1996; Mauldin et al. 1998; Miller 2005; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
GMI targeted and focused a research program that would investigate three major themes:
chipped stone technological organization, spatial organization of hunter-gatherer settlements, and
ground stone recycling. The research program built upon findings at the El Arenal Site (Miller
2007a) and a recent mitigation of 10 sites in TA 1B (Graves et al. 2009).
Spatial Analysis and Interpretation of Site Structure and Occupational History
The nature of Late Archaic and early Formative period settlement and land use within the central
basin landforms of the Jornada Mogollon region has been a relatively constant avenue of inquiry
over the past two decades. Despite the amount of work conducted at sites of these periods, very
little is known regarding the variation in site types and site structures formed through different
modes of social and settlement organization. Whether the thousands of hearth and artifact
scatters and isolated hut structures distributed across the central basin landforms – and as
represented among the current sample of three sites - include multi-family settlements or other
types of cooperative social groupings is still unclear. Nor is it understood how different site
structures may reflect increasingly constrained mobility ranges, changing organizational
structures, food sharing, or any number of regional and extra-regional social, demographic, and
territorial changes.
Numerous ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies have observed patterns of artifact
discard areas surrounding primary living spaces and activity areas (Binford 1978; Enloe et al.
1994; Hayden and Cannon 1983; Koetje 1994; Murray 1980; O’Connell 1987; O’Connell et al.
1992; Stevenson 1991; Yellen 1996). The dimensions and densities of refuse scatters vary
according to several factors, including shifting residence, season of occupation, wind direction,
reoccupation, and anticipated and actual mobility (after Kent 1991; Kent and Vierich 1991), but a
recurrent cultural pattern is size sorting among discard assemblages. Larger items and more
hazardous objects tend to be tossed, swept, or otherwise cleaned and discarded some distance
from activity areas or living spaces, while smaller items such as debitage tend to be overlooked
and remain as primary refuse. Therefore, depending on length of occupation and size of the
4-2

Chapter 4. Theoretical Context and Research Perspectives

resident social group, it would be expected that many apparently low-density, peripheral artifact
scatters at Jornada sites may actually represent discard behavior and are intrinsically associated
with the central hearth feature and its immediate activity area. In other words, the isolated core or
broken biface mapped at some distance beyond a particular hearth activity area may in fact have
been associated with the occupation of that activity area.
Thus, a larger spatial scale of reference emerges beyond the limits of the individual hearthactivity area. This larger scale is equally critical to providing a clear understanding of the
function and occupational history of a particular location, in that several of the observable
distributional and discard patterns of the ethnographic record are correlated with seasonal
mobility, duration of occupation, the size of the resident social group, and other important
settlement and social factors. Moreover, it appears that small sites in the central Hueco Bolson
and Tularosa Basin are often conceptualized on the basis of the typical site and living space
dimensions of the !Kung San, G/wi San, and other groups of the arid Kalahari region (Hitchcock
and Bartram 1998; Lee 1976; Silberbauer 1972; Tanaka 1980; Yellen 1996). Living areas among
these highly mobile groups tend to be relatively small compared to groups occupying settlements
of longer duration. In addition, the spacing of houses and living spaces at larger settlements is
often contingent upon kinship relationships, or social distance, among the inhabitants (Binford
1991; Gargett and Hayden 1991; O’Connell 1987; Whitelaw 1983).
Ethnographic studies of contemporary hunter-gatherer and horticultural groups provide
invaluable insights for modeling the spatial structure of prehistoric sites. There is a tendency
among Jornada archaeologists to consider or adopt ethnographic models solely from huntergatherer groups inhabiting arid environments, such as the various ethnic subdivisions of San
bushmen (Lee 1976; Silberbauer 1972; Tanaka 1980; Taylor 1964) or Australian groups (e.g.,
O’Connell 1987; Spurling and Hayden 1984). Of course, these are most appropriate for
application to the semi-arid environment of the Fort Bliss region. However, spatial patterning can
also be detected at hunter-gather settlements in other environmental contexts, such as more
temperate forest and savanna environments (Kent and Vierich 1991). As one example,
ethnographic studies of Efe pygmy settlements identified interesting patterns of residential
structures arranged around communal roasting features, as well as features “owned” by extended
family groups (Fisher and Strickland 1991).
Aside from the classic ethnographic studies, ethnoarchaeological studies have also examined
artifact and material distributions at abandoned hunter-gatherer settlements. Binford (1978,
1982), Murray (1980), O’Connell (1987), Spurling and Hayden (1984), and Whitelaw (1983),
conducted influential studies that examined the behavioral patterns that created repetitive spatial
relationships between features and various classes of material culture. Additional studies have
built upon these initial efforts and applied them to other areas of the world (Enloe et al. 1994;
Hayden and Cannon 1983; Koetje 1994; O’Connell et al. 1992; Yellen 1996), while other studies
have expanded the behavioral perspective to also bring into focus the specific social contexts that
affect the patterning of features and materials, such as kinship and food sharing (Kent 1991; Kent
and Vierich 1991; Stevenson 1991).
The collective effort of these actualistic studies resulted in the identification of a consistent
archaeological signature. Recurrent patterns among hunter-gatherer settlements include hearthcentered activity areas. Depending upon the length of occupation and size of the resident social
group of the particular settlement, hearth-centered activity areas often have repetitive spatial
associations with patterns of site maintenance and trash disposal. Additionally, correlations
between feature and artifact patterning and the sizes of resident social groups and residential
stability (duration of occupation) have been observed. Hearths are typically located in
relationship to shelters and living spaces. The numbers of hearths are correlated with the size of
the resident social group and length of occupation (Kent 1991; O’Connell 1987; Stevenson 1991),
an observation that has important implications for interpreting prehistoric hunter-gatherer

settlements in the Jornada region. The clusters of multiple hearths observed at numerous
ethnographically-documented hunter-gatherer camps are highly reminiscent of the clusters of
hearths commonly encountered at prehistoric sites in the central Hueco Bolson and Tularosa
Basin, and offer important parallels for interpreting site use.
Patterns of artifact discard and loss are associated with hearth-centered activity areas, including
the “drop and toss zones” defined by Binford (1978) and identified at numerous archaeological
campsites (Enloe et al. 1994; Simek and Larick 1983; Stevenson 1991; Timmins 1996; Vaquero
and Pasto 2002). Longer-term or more intensive use of hearth activity areas results in the
accumulation of various classes of debris, refuse, and discarded items. At camps occupied for
longer durations, these areas are cleaned and debris is removed to the perimeter of the activity
area, or what Stevenson (1991) terms the “displacement” zone. There is a selection bias in this
process, in that artifacts removed or tossed tend to be larger or perceived as more hazardous (e.g.,
cores and lithic tools with sharp edges, rotted bone scrap, heating stones, broken groundstone)
while smaller items such as small waste flakes tend to be overlooked and remain as primary
refuse. This creates a clear size sorting among artifact classes (O’Connell 1987). The ultimate
expression of such discard patterns would be the formation of formal trash middens at intensively
occupied residential sites.
In contrast, site maintenance is much less common at temporary camps (Binford 1978; Jones
1993; Yellen 1977, 1996), and thus lesser degrees of size sorting and differentiation among
artifact classes would be expected. This would also result in little or no distinction between
peripheral displacement zones (if they exist at all) and the immediate drop-and-toss zones
surrounding hearth activity areas.
The dimensions of hearth-centered activity areas have been found to correlate with the size of the
resident household group and duration of occupation (Kent 1991; O’Connell 1987; Stevenson
1991; Yellen 1977). The dimensions of activity areas at !Kung San campsites occupied by small
social groups for relatively short periods are significantly smaller than those occupied for longer
periods by larger Alyawara household groups. This pattern tends to hold true in the broader
cross-cultural analysis reported by Kent (1991).
Using the abovementioned ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies as guidelines, spatial
analysis and identification of variable forms of site structure at prehistoric Jornada huntergatherer and horticulturalist settlements may be used to make general inferences regarding the
duration of settlement, size of resident social group, the systemic function and orientation of the
site (i.e., residential forager, residential collector, task-specific collector).
Recent analysis of spatial point pattern distributions at the El Arenal site yielded estimates of site
occupation span that could be integrated into broader analyses of mobility, seasonality, and
technological organization. As illustrated in Figure 4.1, comparisons of the spatial extent of
artifact debris patterns at El Arenal with ethnographically and ethnoarchaeologically documented
patterns resulted in a general estimate that El Arenal was occupied for periods of 20 to 60 days
and perhaps up to 100 days, and was clearly not occupied for brief durations of less than 20 days.
Technological Organization
A relatively substantial assemblage of artifacts was previously recovered from 41EP970 (FB
7520) during the Fort Bliss Small Site Project (Mauldin et al. 1998), including 463 surface and 24
subsurface artifacts. Subsurface artifacts were recovered from test excavation blocks and
additional artifacts were recovered from the site surface and during hand excavations. This site
had excellent potential for analysis of technological organization based on attribute analysis of
the chipped stone collections and was integrated into the analyses performed during the current
project.

The lower red outline denotes extent of non-random spatial debris scatters at El
Arenal, suggesting that occupations at this site were in the general range of 20-100
days.

Based on results from the El Arenal analysis (Miller 2007a), it was expected that Late Archaic
occupations would have more evidence of formal tool production, use, and discard that reflect
logistically-organized hunting forays. Patterns of technological organization would include
evidence for retooling as seen in discard of non-local raw materials during the resharpening or
replacement of worn and broken formal tools. Hunter-gatherer groups with high levels of logistic
mobility apportion periods of down time for gearing up sessions to rejuvenate and produce tools
for anticipated hunts and plant procurement sessions (Binford 1979; Kelly 1988; Kuhn 1994;
Nelson 1991; Sellet 2004; Torrence 1983, 1989).
Among more residentially mobile groups, the production and maintenance of formal tools is often
viewed as a practice of continual “make and mend” sessions (Kuhn 1989; Silberbauer 1981).
Mobile hunters often find themselves in areas where materials are scarce or are of poor quality,
and thus must have tools on hand for whichever task is required. Portable, maintainable, or
reliable (after Bleed 1986; Nelson 1991) tools that can be reworked, rejuvenated, or repaired or
that may serve multiple functions would be best suited for such conditions. Bifacial tools are
often viewed as the most efficient technological option under such circumstances (Kelly 1988).
Such valuable tools requiring use of non-local or scarce materials were often transported back to
residential settlements for repair, recycling, or retooling, with unrepairable items often discarded
and replaced. In contrast, early Formative occupations should have lesser evidence of retooling,
formal tool production and discard, and non-local materials.
4-5

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

The lithic artifact assemblage from 41EP970 (FB 7520) and the other two project sites were
examined for evidence of formal tool production and retooling. One means of recognizing
logistically organized curation and retooling practices is by the presence of non-local materials
among formal or more intensively utilized tool classes and the use of local materials for expedient
tools (Andrefsky 1994; Bamforth 1986, 1991; Brantingham et al. 2000; Kuhn 1991, 1993).
Similar patterns of local and non-local raw material use among formal tool forms have been
identified among several Old and New World contexts. Research on Mousterian and Aurignacian
tool assemblages in Europe has identified similar patterns of tool use and transport (Blades 2000;
Kuhn 1993; Stiner and Kuhn 1992) that reflect different organizational strategies. Wide-ranging
foraging or logistical procurement of game has been linked to increased tool resharpening and
evidence of artifact transport in the form of non-local materials. Conversely, more intensive and
localized occupations are associated with greater use of locally available raw materials and less
intensive use of tools made from such materials. Although the associated patterns of faunal
scavenging versus direct procurement in the Mousterian example were not appropriate for the
present case, the overall pattern of more intensive use of maintainable tools for wide-ranging
logistical procurement does apply.
Early- and middle-stage reduction debitage should consist primarily of local materials, broken
bifacial and formal tools should have higher proportions of non-local and distant materials, and
formal tools should show evidence of intensive use and resharpening. Such evidence should be
present in the debitage assemblage in the form of small waste flakes resulting from resharpening
and maintenance of formal tools and bifacial manufacturing debris (as opposed to core reduction
debris consisting of local materials). Chipped-stone analysis methods used to identify these traits
included measurement of flake size and other attributes indicating bifacial reduction or tool
maintenance (the expectation is the presence of high proportions of small, late-stage debitage).
The analyses documented the formality of bifacial and unifacial tools, the ratios of formal to
informal flake tools, edge wear patterns, and use intensity.
Raw material sources were generically grouped as local (e.g., natural material outcrops in the
Hueco and Franklin mountains several kilometers east and west of the project area), non-local
(e.g., sources in the Rio Grande Valley, the Organ mountains of the western Tularosa Basin, or
Sacramento mountains of the northern basin), and distant (e.g., obsidian from sources in
Chihuahua or Cerro del Medio in northern New Mexico). These raw material groups were crosstabulated against debitage, core, and tool forms, and flake size grades to examine the issues of
retooling, raw material provisioning, and logistical hunting organization based on the model
analysis conducted at El Arenal (Miller 2007b).
Groundstone Recycling during the Archaic to Formative Transition
Ground and battered stone tools were previously collected at 41EP970 (FB 7520; Mauldin et al.
1998). Many of the groundstone tools were recycled as cookstones for use in thermal features, a
very common occurrence at prehistoric Jornada sites across the central basin landforms. The
combined factors of high numbers of groundstone tools and hearth features of good integrity that
may yield chronometric dates indicates that 41EP970 (FB 7520) could provide an excellent
context to study long-term patterns of groundstone recycling.
Miller (2007) and Miller and Burt (2007) have recently proposed that one aspect of Mesilla phase
subsistence involved a greater emphasis on bulk seed processing, similar to that suggested for
later prehistoric periods in the Great Basin (Eerkens 2003a, 2004). The incorporation of ceramic
containers as part of the mobile toolkit of Mesilla hunter-gatherer groups reflects this increased
emphasis on seed collection, storage, and processing via boiling. Temper and compositional
attributes of Mesilla phase brownware assemblages suggest the ceramic vessels were designed to
function as portable and durable containers and cooking tools (Miller and Burt 2007).
4-6

Chapter 4. Theoretical Context and Research Perspectives

Production decisions and temper selection by Mesilla phase potters were designed to satisfy both
the requirements for strong vessels that could be moved from site to site, in addition to having
moderate resistance to thermal fatigue from cooking and boiling. Domestic vessel inventories
appear to have been limited to a small range of functional, transportable pots. The evidence from
Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) studies suggests distant transport of vessels, a finding
corroborated by the results of temper attribute analysis that indicate technological production of
early El Paso brownware vessels were designed as a compromise between strength and thermal
shock resistance, and that this functional compromise may best characterize Mesilla phase
ceramic production.
The increased use of seeds may be considered as a new form of resource exploitation and
intensification that led to the need for ceramic vessels with their distinct storage, containment,
and cooking attributes. Seed processing is well documented both archaeologically and
ethnographically among indigenous groups in the Western Australian deserts and Great Basin of
North America (Cane 1989; Edwards and O’Connell 1995; Eerkens 2003a, 2004; O’Connell and
Hawkes 1981; Smith 1986) and has been suggested as a primary reason for the adoption of
ceramics in the Great Basin (Eerkens 2003b, 2004). Intensification of seed use has been
documented in terms of both broad-spectrum subsistence intensification (Bettinger 1991; Madsen
and Schmitt 1998) and optimal foraging theory (Edwards and O’Connell 1995; O’Connell and
Hawkes 1981).
Noting that the drying trend that occurred during the Archaic to Formative period transition may
have affected water availability and biomass, the use of seeds and accompanying technologies
can be modeled under a diet breadth model as an adaptive response to patchy and uncertain water
availability. Seeds and ceramics represent a form of intensified “mass capture” procurement
technology (Bettinger 1991) that may be considered time and energy efficient (although
providing a reduced caloric return). Such energy-conserving foraging practices may have helped
reduce risk associated with foraging around widely scattered and unpredictable water sources.
The use of ceramic containers for heat retention and transfer during seed boiling may have served
to override the on-site processing needs for groundstone implements, thus resulting in ground
stone items being recycled as cookstone heating elements in stone-poor central basin landforms.
If such patterns hold true, it is expected that groundstone implements recycled as cookstone
heating elements will be significantly more common in hearth features dating to the Mesilla phase
rather than Late Archaic period.
It is acknowledged that the sample of hearths and groundstone items from 41EP970 (FB 7520)
may be insufficient to provide a statistically robust study of technological change. In order to
augment the current study, a literature review was conducted in an attempt to locate additional
dated features with recycled groundstone tools. The results of similar studies were incorporated
in the present analysis. While groundstone assemblages are often reported and described from
various sites, the specific association of recycled groundstone and dated hearth features is seldom
reported. The ongoing studies at 41EP970 (FB 7520) will establish a departure point for future
documentation of the chronology and context of groundstone recycling in the Jornada region.

CHAPTER 5.
FIELD EVALUATION, COLLECTION, AND
EXCAVATION METHODS
Investigation of the three project sites was conducted utilizing a two-phase approach. This
approach was used to better identify which sites could provide scientific information that could
address the research domains set forth in Chapter 4 that are relevant to the greater Jornada region.
The field procedures complied with the stipulations of the Request for Proposals (RFP) and
policies of the Fort Bliss Environmental Division. Fieldwork involved combinations of
additional hand-excavation units around surface features and mechanical excavations. For the
two sites initially examined during the Fort Bliss Small Site Project (Mauldin et al. 1998; Fort
Bliss Project 90-11), field maps and existing collections was obtained from the Fort Bliss
Curation Facility and was incorporated into the analysis of material culture, site maps, and spatial
structure for the project prior to field work and report production.
PHASED MITIGATION STRATEGY
Task 1 of the RFP required the development of a draft Data Recovery Plan for the three
properties that would be capable of recovering and/or documenting archaeological data relevant
to each of the research domains identified in Significance and Research Standards for Prehistoric
Sites at Fort Bliss (Miller et al. 2009). Task 1 further required that the plan include the
development of a “phased mitigation” strategy using funding resources to focus the effort on
site(s) with the best potential for recovering significant data.
In reviewing the site information above, GMI had determined that two sites appeared to have
limited or very little research potential (Table 5.1). These sites had few features and very small
artifact counts that were statistically meaningless for comparative intrasite or intersite analyses of
assemblage variation or diversity. GMI included an initial phase of investigations that would
determine whether these two sites had sufficient research potential to address the research
domains outlined in this research design.

Phase I Testing and Evaluation
Phase I consisted of mapping surface observations of site layout and recording the quantity, type
and location of surface cultural materials and features at all three project sites, and included
surface mapping, collection of surface artifacts, and backhoe test trenching. Once Phase I was
completed, the three project sites were reviewed. A subset of the three project sites were selected
for intensive data recovery excavations in Phase II in consultation with Fort Bliss DPW-E. The
single site selected for more intensive data recovery excavations in Phase II (41EP970/FB 7520)
was chosen because this site had the best potential to contribute data relevant to the project
research questions. The section below outlines the field methods used during both phases of the
project. Because the approach for this project included a phased mitigation that apportioned a
substantial proportion of the total funding resources and archaeological investigations of the
project to the most productive site out of the three project sites, varying assessment strategies
were used at each site.
The first component of the Phase I field investigations after surface mapping involved backhoe
test trenching. Additional surface artifacts were integrated with previous collections to determine
which areas on these sites could truly provide information to address current and relevant
research domains at Fort Bliss and the greater Jornada region. For example, trenches were placed
near the single feature at 41EP5714 (FB 12284) to assess whether a buried cultural surface with
additional features and artifacts was present around this location. These attributes were not
observed, and it was determined after the feature was excavated that the site required no further
investigation.
Similarly, trenches and hand units were excavated to evaluate site 41EP6301 (FB 12245), as well
as the only intact remains of a feature observed at this site. Trenches were examined to evaluate
whether activity areas and other productive cultural contexts were buried beneath the “stable
grassland” geomorphic context of this site. These backhoe trenches assisted in determining that
this site and others in this area represent dispersed and displaced cultural materials associated
with bulldozing activities conducted by the US Army during the Cold War era. The charcoal
stain remains of Feature 1 excavated during Fort Bliss Project 90-11 (Mauldin et al. 1998) and
Feature 4 excavated during Phase I investigations of the current project were identified as the
basal elements of thermal hearths. Backhoe scrapes were also utilized to expose hearths,
although this method tends to remove most of the associated artifact content.
Similar Phase I investigations were conducted at the large site 41EP970 (FB 7520) to determine
what parts of the site have statistically interpretable artifact counts in association with features.
Where meager artifact counts were identified with intact prehistoric occupations surfaces, these
areas still were not recommended for further investigation given the lack of a robust statistical
sample.
The GMI scope of work allocated approximately five days of fieldwork for Phase I investigations
of the three sites and to identify the areas with the best potential to provide scientific information
to address current and relevant research domains at Fort Bliss and the greater Jornada region.
The majority of the Phase I investigations focused on 41EP970 (FB 7520) to investigate the 70
feature locations, identify locations of all previous collections and all newly exposed surface
materials and features. The data from previous collections was integrated with features that
contain the best integrity as identified during Phase I investigations to develop a plan reallocating
remaining funds toward more thorough and productive investigations of specific areas on the
three sites. Before proceeding with any time and budget reallocations, GMI project staff met with
Fort Bliss Environmental Division staff and reviewed the findings and recommendations of the
initial phase of the mitigation program.

Chapter 5. Field Evaluation, Collection, and Excavation Methods

Phase I Site Mapping
Site 41EP970 (FB 7520) was mapped and 100 percent surface collected during Fort Bliss Project
90-11 (Mauldin et al. 1998). GMI staff obtained the project files and artifact collections for this
project from the Fort Bliss Curation Facility and reconstructed the spatial layout of these sites.
Datum points were re-established and grid points were geo-referenced to Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) coordinates using Global Positioning System (GPS) units.
For the other two project sites, GMI archaeologists utilized existing maps and site records to
locate the sites. The initial field procedure was to relocate previously established datum points
within sites and to establish and confirm the spatial boundaries of each site. GPS and Total
Station points were recorded for the site datum, surface collection points, excavation unit
locations, cultural features, natural and modern landscape features, or any other point as
determined necessary by the field archaeologists. All of this information was stored
electronically and downloaded into a notebook computer; differential correction of the GPS data
will be done using the nearest New Mexico base station.
As is typical for multiyear investigations of sites in active eolian environments, the artifact
visibility and site boundary definition can vary dramatically from project to project. Exposure of
two or three artifacts 20 m from previously recorded artifacts can increase the overall area of a
given site by as much as 400-square meters. Conversely, previous surface collection of artifacts
will generally create a situation where site dimensions are dramatically reduced during
subsequent visits because the original artifact distributions are no longer present. These factors
only slightly affected the site area on 41EP970 (FB 7520) in one small area against the western
and southwest margins of the site; otherwise, all site boundaries remained the same as previously
recorded.
GPS data points were also recorded for selected natural and modern features. Extensive dune
sands were documented to identify percent of surface covered on each of the sites. Also
documented were any roads immediately adjacent to, or intersecting sites, and any major
disturbance (e.g., hull downs and motocross trails). The GPS information collected during the
project was stored electronically and downloaded into a computer notebook. Differential
correction of the GPS data was completed using the Texas Department of Transportation Base
Station in El Paso, Texas.
The use of a GPS-based provenience system has proven useful for coordinating various datasets
such as surface collection plots, features, units, elevations, and trench column samples.
Moreover, the availability of geo-rectified Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates
allows these datasets to be plotted on high-quality digital orthophotographic quadrangle (DOQ)
aerial photographs.
PHASE II MITIGATION
Additional archaeological work was conducted at 41EP970 (FB 7520) and areas within this site
that were found to contain sufficient information potential to address the research issues set forth
in this work plan.
Phase II Surface Collection
During fieldwork at 41EP970 (FB 7520), additional artifacts exposed since the original 1990
fieldwork were collected and point-provenienced during Phase I. This data as well as the point
provenience data from the previous assessment of 41EP970 (FB 7520) by Mauldin et al. (1998)
were incorporated into the spatial analysis for this site.

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

At the two smaller sites (41EP5714/ FB 12284 and 41EP6301/ FB 12245), 100 percent of the
artifacts were also collected, even though the items on 41EP6301 (FB 12245) were not in context
due to previous surface sediment displacement. This information was used to generate site maps
showing surface collection distributions, subsurface test areas, and any other relevant
information. All artifacts were subject to appropriate analyses that provided data necessary for
spatial analyses and other research issues discussed elsewhere.
Phase II Subsurface Excavation
The formal Phase II subsurface excavations involved two methods, including manual excavation
of surface features followed by mechanical test trenching and surface stripping (Table 5.2).
Manual excavations of thermal features and areas of high artifact density were conducted first.
This included up to 20 thermal features and 200-square meters of hand-excavated units. The
assumptions for these figures were based upon feature totals and artifact densities presented in the
site documentation. Features exhibiting the highest probability of integrity and associated
artifacts were accorded the highest priority for excavation. The placement and size of excavation
units were oriented toward maximizing feature and artifact recovery, as well as attempting to
clearly identify the spatial associations (or lack thereof) between features and activity areas.
Formal hearth pits were bisected and profiled, and all relevant subsistence and chronometric
samples was collected.

Artifact-bearing deposits and cultural features, including structures, hearths, and extramural pits,
were hand excavated. Excavated sediments will be passed through ⅛-inch mesh screen as
stipulated in the RFP. However, a sample of select units outside of features was also selected for
fine screening (⅛-inch mesh) to investigate whether small tool production and maintenance
debitage is present around hearth features. Hearth pits and other cultural features were bisected
and profiled, and all relevant subsistence and chronometric samples were collected.
The final excavation method utilized backhoe trenches and surface scrapes. Backhoe trenches
provided information for the geomorphic and geoarchaeological investigation of the project area.
Backhoe trenching was performed on all three project sites. The total number of trenches varied
by site (Table 5.3), were between 10 m to 20 m in length, and were excavated to varying depths,
depending on the context and nature of the local stratigraphy. Surface scrapes were reserved for
areas where suspected features were obscured by dune deposits on 41EP970 (FB 7520). The
locations of the surface scrapes were determined by the extent of site area suspected to be buried
under sheet sand deposits.

LABORATORY ANALYSES AND SPECIAL STUDIES
The following section briefly describes the proposed laboratory procedures and special studies
utilized during the project. These procedures comply with the stipulations of the RFP and
reporting policies of Fort Bliss Environmental Division. A standard set of groundstone, lithic,
and ceramic attributes recorded by GMI analysts for all Fort Bliss projects will be used.
Previous Data and Collections from Fort Bliss Project 90-11
All analyses and data presentations (e.g., maps, spatial plots) incorporated previously collected
data from the Fort Bliss Project 90-11 testing program at two of the three project sites (Mauldin et
al. 1998). Lithic, ceramic, and groundstone artifacts collected from surface and subsurface
contexts during this testing program were geo-referenced and combined with assemblage data
newly recovered during the current project.
Spatial Analysis
The fundamental prerequisite for evaluating archaeological site structure involved the spatial
clustering and association of features, artifacts, activity areas, and disposal areas. GMI applied
several statistical models adopted from plant ecology, and geography to evaluate the degree to
which cultural materials were clustered. Several techniques of quantitative spatial analyses in
archaeology have been adopted from the fields of plant ecology and geography (e.g., Clarke
1977; Diggle 1983; Hodder and Orton 1976; Kintigh 1990; Pielou 1969). The specific spatial
analyses methods utilized in this study include those available in Kintigh’s Tools for Quantitative
Archaeology software package as described in his accompanying manual (Kintigh 2002; see also
Kintigh 1990). These included nearest neighbor analysis, Hodder and Okell’s A, local density
analysis, and pure locational clustering (k-means), and the Gettis-Ord G statistic recently applied
at several sites near the present project area (Graves et al. 2009).
Several more recent applications of point pattern analysis adopted from ecology were applied to
the point pattern data from the project area. These include Ripley’s K and L functions (Dixon
2002; Ripley 1976, 1977) and Wiegand and Maloney’s (2004; see also Wiegand et al. 1999) Oring statistic. These point pattern analysis methods can reveal scales at which various material
categories exhibit non-random clustering or separation and thus provide insights into the
dimensions of various activity areas and living spaces. If, for example, variable patterns of
artifact and feature associations were detected, the next procedure was to evaluate the scales or
distances at which such patterns occur using Ripley’s K and L functions and the O-ring statistic.
This data, in turn, was then compared to the ethnographically documented dimensions of activity
areas formed by hunter-gatherer groups with differing mobility patterns.

The ultimate intent of the proposed spatial study was to determine whether or not broad, general,
and consistent patterning was detectible at one or more spatial scales and, whether such
patterning was logically interpretable with reference to the body of ethnographic and prehistoric
research on the spatial arrangement of features, activity areas, and trash disposal areas at huntergatherer settlements. In turn, these provided an additional corroborative dataset, along with
chronometric and other data, with which to interpret site formation processes, site structure, and
ultimately provide some insights into the occupational history of the sites in question (Graves et
al. 2009; Miller 2007).
CHRONOMETRICS, RELATIVE CHRONOLOGY, AND OCCUPATIONAL HISTORY
The primary chronometric research objective was to obtain absolute radiocarbon age estimates
from the project area sites, and, accordingly, a suitable amount of funding was designated for
radiocarbon dating. This included eight standard and eight AMS radiocarbon dates to fully
explore the chronometric variability of the subset of significant sites. For spatial analysis and
reconstruction of site structure and occupational history, and as the foundation of all subsequent
research issues, establishing the temporal order of features and occupations was most important.
Radiocarbon dates are required to demonstrate some degree of contemporaneity or non­
contemporaneity among features both within and between sites. GMI attempted to obtain dates
for many of the sampled features at the three sites. In the case of eroded features, excavation
methods included techniques for the recovery of small charcoal samples for AMS dating.
Ceramic and projectile point types were used as relative chronological indicators, but primarily in
a corroborative role. An important aspect of the analysis of spatial associations of materials
involved statistical comparisons of the distance relationships between radiocarbon-dated contexts
and relative dating materials. For example, projectile point and ceramic distributions were
compared to radiocarbon-dated contexts to evaluate contemporaneity, and therefore the assumed
association, between the artifacts and occupation areas.
Other analyses were conducted on the chronometric and chronological data to further evaluate the
occupational history of sites and occupational clusters. Contemporaneity tests were used to
determine whether radiocarbon age estimates from various features, occupational clusters, and
other proveniences were statistically coeval. One or more of several Bayesian approaches were
used to evaluate likelihood ratios (probabilities) of various combinations of dated contexts, and
general chronometric trends among major provenience areas within 41EP970 (FB 7520). For
example, it was possible to isolate broad site areas having a greater focus of Late Archaic versus
early Formative occupation among the scattered and clustered distribution of features.
CERAMIC, LITHIC, AND GROUNDSTONE ANALYSIS
In light of the potential research issues for this project, it was recommended that lithic
assemblages be a primary focus of analytical attention. Close attention was paid to technological
attributes, tool forms, and raw materials. The Fort Bliss Lithic Source Project type collection on
file at Fort Bliss DPW-E was consulted to identify materials present around the region. A
primary focus of the lithic analysis involved cross-tabulations of raw material types and varieties
against various tool and debitage classes.
Conventional chipped-stone analyses methods and attributes were used to establish baseline data
from which other analyses were also drawn. These included the identification of raw materials,
artifact types, use-wear and modification, size, weight, and the presence of cortex. These data
were then analyzed for purposes of determining origins of raw materials and finished artifacts,
organization of production, trade or exchange, and patterns of discard.

5-6

Chapter 5. Field Evaluation, Collection, and Excavation Methods

The relatively large assemblage of lithic artifacts from 41EP970 (FB 7520) was studied by
applying the lithic technology and settlement models developed by Dockall (1999) and Miller
(1990, 2007). These were premised on a general technological shift noted by Parry and Kelly
(1987) that corresponds to increasing sedentism and decreasing mobility. These models proposed
several clearly and consistently identifiable differences in assemblage content that reflect greater
degrees of residential duration for sites where expedient core technologies dominate. In addition,
Miller’s (2007) more recent model of assemblage formation was applied. This model identified
three dimensions of chipped-stone technology that reflect organizational responses to subsistence
and environmental conditions. The first dimension involved the role of game hunting and
logistical mobility. The second dimension involved the increasing reliance on plant foods, bulk
processing, and domestic tasks that created a need for more durable tools. The third dimension
reflected differences in residential stability that results in more thorough on-site lithic reduction
that affects both the proportions and sizes of cores and debitage. Raw material issues were
interwoven within each dimension, but in a manner that was selective, opportunistic, and related
to anticipated extractive and maintenance tasks. It is proposed that the interplay of these
dimensions influenced technological decisions of the inhabitants of the region and ultimately
resulted in the formation of the chipped-stone assemblages deposited at the sites.
A second study involved a frequently overlooked aspect of lithic studies in the area that involves
the presence and nature of tool production and maintenance debitage at low-density occupations.
The presence of microdebitage, bifacial thinning flakes, and resharpening flakes indicates on-site
tool production or maintenance, and accordingly, the presence of these items indicated some
degree of residential occupation. Raw material types identified among production and
maintenance debitage was compared to those observed among larger lithic types at the site to
determine whether “gearing up” took place (Bamforth 1991; Kelly and Todd 1988; Kuhn 1991).
It was expected that most groundstone specimens would be fragmentary, thus prohibiting
comparative analyses of the size and grinding surface area. Groundstone artifacts were examined
and attributes of type, raw material, texture, metric dimensions, and secondary use were
documented. Numerous studies have demonstrated interesting correlations between groundstone
dimensions and morphology and the changing processing requirements of maize versus nondomesticated seeds (Calamia 1991; Hard et al. 1996; Mauldin and Leach 1994). However, a
fundamental problem in evaluating these models for the project area is the fact that most
groundstone artifacts are fragmentary and therefore cannot provide useful information on size or
shape. Additionally, no whole specimens were recovered during this project.
As reviewed in the research design, groundstone artifacts were frequently recycled for use as
cookstone in thermal features. While this has often been noticed and clearly represents a
fundamental change in the use of thermal features and plant procurement/processing tools,
unfortunately no attempt has been made to monitor chronological trends of such recycling.
Analysis of groundstone recycling during the current project noted whether the item had been
used as hearth stone, and if other evidence of secondary use (cores, hammerstones) was evident.
The chronological context of recycled specimens was an important consideration. Raw material
types used in the manufacture of groundstone specimens were also monitored as evidence of
procurement areas and prehistoric mobility trends, with reference to lithic sourcing issues
discussed by Church et al. (1996). Cookstone materials recovered from thermal features were
examined for the presence of recycled groundstone. Heat fracture, discoloration, and other
evidence of breakage was monitored on groundstone artifacts to verify their use as cookstones.
Ceramic artifacts received less emphasis, given the nature of the ceramic assemblages as
currently recorded at the three sites; however, it is well understood that ceramics represent a
pivotal source of information for sites in the Jornada Mogollon region. Based on the results of
previous survey and testing programs at the project sites, very few non-local ceramics were
expected. Non-local ceramic wares and types were identified, described, and attributes of vessel
5-7

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

form and general temper type was reviewed. Most or all ceramics recovered during the
investigations were small, fragmentary El Paso brownware sherds that lacked diagnostic
attributes of vessel form and decoration.
Several aspects of El Paso brownware technology and preservation have hindered previous
analyses of this indigenous ceramic type, including typically small sample sizes, small sherd
sizes, lack of design elements, non-standardized production technology, and absence of a
comparative collection of whole vessels (Miller 1996; Perttula et al. 1995). A conventional
description of the El Paso brownware ceramic assemblage was provided, including vessel forms,
rim styles, and basic technological attributes (e.g., temper, surface treatment). The distribution of
ceramic artifacts was included in the chronometric and spatial analyses. Measurement of the
thickness and weight of the ceramics recovered was also conducted during the current project.
MACROBOTANICAL AND FAUNAL ANALYSIS
Subsistence studies are among the most critical sources of information for archaeological
research. Unfortunately, given the topographic and geomorphic context of the project area, the
potential for productive recovery rates of botanical and faunal materials was not expected to be
favorable.
Conventional subsistence studies such as macrobotanical, pollen, and faunal studies were
conducted. Standard one and two liter sediment samples (depending on the density and amount
of the fill) were collected from the better-preserved features and five light fractions were
submitted to Dr. Phil Dering of Shumla Archeobotanical Services for analysis of plant remains.
In all, and depending upon recovery rates, inferences regarding prehistoric subsistence may have
to be indirect and necessarily rather vague. In other words, they may, by necessity, have to rely
on second and third order proxy data, as is typically done for many paleoenvironmental studies
(sensu Caran 1998).
Faunal bone was occasionally encountered in the fills of better-preserved hearth features and
residential structures. However, the frequency and preservation of faunal bone and sample sizes
of faunal remains at sites in the area is seldom sufficient enough to allow for any robust analysis.
In addition, faunal assemblages almost universally consist of rabbit bone (Lepus and Sylvilagus
sp.). Specimens recovered from hearth features were submitted to a qualified analyst for
identification of species and evidence of cultural modification as part of the study of logistical
land use and the function of thermal features.
HUMAN BURIALS
Human burials were not encountered at these sites.
ARTIFACT AND DOCUMENT CURATION
All artifactual materials, organic samples, and documentation in the form of field and laboratory
notes or forms, were prepared for curation according to the Fort Bliss curation guidelines.
Laboratory analysis results were maintained on both digital computer media and as paper printout
copies for curation at the Fort Bliss Environmental Division. GIS data was submitted in the
required format. Digital databases of artifact and sample catalogs were also provided. Reports
provided by subcontractors and analytical specialists (i.e., macrobotanical analyst, radiocarbon
laboratory) were placed in file folders and included with the project documentation submitted to
Fort Bliss Environmental Division. All photographs were stored and cataloged according to Fort
Bliss standards.

RESULTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA RECOVERY
INVESTIGATIONS
Tim Graves and Tabitha Griffith
From September through November of 2009, GMI archaeologists conducted data recovery
investigations at three sites (41EP970/FB 7520, 41EP5714/FB 12284, and 41EP 6301/FB 12245)
in Training Area (TA) 1B. The research design for this project incorporated a phased approach to
mitigating the sites, apportioning both archaeological effort and funding resources of the project
to obtaining the most productive subset of data recovered during current investigations. Table 6.1
summarizes the excavation activities performed at the three sites.

During the current investigations, the boundary of each site was reestablished and a new datum
was installed if the original could not be located. Additionally, the level of effort at each site
included:
(1) Collection of 100 percent of surface artifacts on each site;
(2) identification and recording of the locations of surface features;
(3) mechanical excavation of trenches and documentation of the subsurface archaeology and
natural stratigraphy; and
(4) documentation of changes in landforms that may have covered and/or displaced
archaeological materials.
Mechanical excavations in the form of backhoe trenches were performed at all three of the project
sites; backhoe scrapes were used only on 41EP970 (FB 7520), the largest of the three sites.
Manual excavations were conducted at all three of the project sites. Through excavation
activities at the three project sites, a representative sample of archaeological data associated with
major features (such as pithouses and activity areas) and isolated features were recorded.

Previous Investigations
The site 41EP970 (FB 7520) was first identified in 1977 during an initial cultural resource survey
of Fort Bliss (Whalen 1978:156, Fort Bliss Project 76-02). At that time, the site was recorded as
three, small, separate campsites and an isolated groundstone artifact (Table 6.2). Originally, site
EPCM 31:106:3:0884 (FB 7518) was described as a 300-square meter area that contained one
chopper, one mano, lithic artifacts, and groundstone. Site EPCM 31:106:3:0885 (FB 7519) was
previously described as a 200-square meter area that contained two thermal features. The final
site (EPCM 31:106:3:0886/FB 7520) covered a 200-square meter area and was comprised of a
single thermal feature, one scraper and other lithic artifacts.

During the Fort Bliss Site File Rectification Project (Lukowski 1990b, Fort Bliss Project 90-05),
the three sites originally recorded by Whalen (1978) were assigned Fort Bliss (FB) site numbers
(see Table 6.2). The sites were later assigned TexSite trinomial site numbers, and during the Fort
Bliss Small Sites Project in 1990-1991 (Mauldin et al. 1998, Fort Bliss Project 90-11), the sites
originally recorded by Whalen (1978) were revisited, combined and given a single TexSite
trinomial number and Fort Bliss site number, 41EP970 (FB 7520).
At that time, the site was tested and characterized (Mauldin et al. 1998:244-247, Fort Bliss
Project 90-11); surface mapping and subsurface testing identified 70 features, including burned
rock hearths, 10 small stains, and one large stain in a 57,551-square meter area. A total of 32.86
square meters (3.97 cubic meters) was excavated and five features (Feature 2, Feature 27, Feature
29, Feature 43, and Feature 67) were tested (Table 6.3). Feature 2 (a hearth) yielded an Early
Archaic period radiocarbon date of 5,620 ± 80 B.P. (Beta No. 50092) and obsidian hydration
performed on seven specimens resulted in dates from the Late Archaic period to the Protohistoric
period (Table 6.4).
The site was 100 percent surface collected, resulting in the collection of 466 surface artifacts and
24 subsurface artifacts. The artifact collections include 261 chipped stone (debitage, cores,
informal tools), 15 formal lithic tools, 156 ground and battered items, and 58 ceramics during
Fort Bliss Project 90-11 (Mauldin et al. 1998: 386). The 15 formal lithic tools included four
projectile points (three fragments and one complete). These projectile points were typed to
specific components and included one Paleo-Indian midsection fragment, two Middle Archaic
base fragments, and an El Paso phase projectile point style. The presence of El Paso brownware
ceramics further indicated that the site contained a Formative period component. Two bone
fragments recovered from Feature 43 were unidentifiable as an element or taxa, but were
described as burned (Stratton 1998:420). A pollen sample from Feature 2 during Fort Bliss
Project 90-11 11 (Mauldin et al. 1998) identified unidentified conifer wood (Holloway 1998:449).
Site 41EP970 (FB 7520) was described as continuing to have significant data and research
potential.

Current Investigations
In 2009 from September to November, GMI archaeologists conducted data recovery excavations
at 41EP970 (FB 7520), a large, multicomponent prehistoric camp. The area of the site currently
defined by GIS shape file is 56,361-square meters (Figure 6.1) and extends 440-m southeast to
northwest by 260-m southwest to northeast, at an elevation of approximately 1,222 m (4,010 ft)
above mean sea level (amsl). The site is located in the central portion of the Hueco Bolson on the
eastern edge of a broad ridge on the desert floor that trends north to south (see Appendix A).
During the current investigation, cultural material was found just outside the previously
documented site boundary and the site size was adjusted slightly to the southwest.
The previously established datum was no longer present but was extrapolated from the aerial plot
used during site testing in 1991 (Mauldin et al. 1998) and was utilized during the current
investigation to correspond all previous collections and excavations. Thirty-eight of the original
70 features identified on the site were relocated during the current site assessment. In addition to
the 38 previously recorded features, 10 additional surface features and 29 additional subsurface
features were identified and recorded. These newly recorded features were assigned numbers
starting with Feature 71. Five of the previously recorded features and 34 of the newly identified
features were excavated during the current project.
In addition to reestablishing the site boundary, 100 percent of the surface artifacts were collected.
Surface artifacts totaling 346 were collected during the current project. A total of 215-square
meters of the site was manually excavated in 10 excavation blocks. In addition, 89-square meters
of the site were trenched and 334-square meters were scraped with a backhoe. The manual
excavation blocks and the backhoe excavations were placed over site features and in areas with
good integrity in the west central and southeastern portions of the site. The backhoe trenches
were placed in areas that were likely to provide an accurate characterization of the subsurface
sediments and the geomorphic context of the site. The provenience of each collected surface
artifact, features, excavation blocks, backhoe trenches, and backhoe scrapes were documented
using a sub-meter accuracy GPS (see Figure 6.1).
Environmental Setting
Site 41EP970 (FB 7520) is situated within numerous interdunal areas that are between large
coppice dunes. The dunes are 1-m to 2.5-m high and have been stabilized by mesquite and
fourwing saltbush. The site is located 355 m west of a major fault line depression or playa.

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

Vegetation in the site area consists of mesquite, fourwing saltbush, soaptree yucca, broom
snakeweed, and some perennials, in decreasing order of frequency. This flora is categorized as a
basin desert shrub land – coppice (Space Imaging/Geoeye 2000, IKONOS data).
Surface visibility in the site area ranges from 45 to 55 percent. Recent eolian sands (coppice
dunes) cover 45 percent (25,307-square meters) of the site and flora covers an additional 10
percent of the site surfaces. Tracked and other vehicle impacts have impacted 30 to 50 percent of
the site surface. Erosion in interdunal areas ranges from minimal to excessive. Interdunal areas
that have experienced severe erosion are estimated to be 40 cm to as much as 1.5 m below
historic surfaces, as identified from trench profiles and exposures against stabilized dune sheets
within the site.
A dirt road that trends east to west through the northern portion of the site is roughly 9-m wide,
extends 234 m through the site, and impacts 2,106 square meters of the site. Erosion near the
margin of this road is severe and has impacted 7.5 percent of the site area. In addition, an El Paso
Natural Gas line was placed in the south central portion of the site. This disturbance area was
roughly 6-m wide and extended across 159 m of the site, impacting 954-square meters (1.7
percent) of the site.
The surface sediments consist of recently deposited, light brown sand and some brown sandy
loam with a few surface gravel and pebble-sized inclusions. In addition within and near the main
east/west road and at the west end of the site surfaces are eroded down to a caliche dominated
substrate of a light brown to pinkish white sandy loam with a very high density of caliche/calcium
enriched deposits generally reflective of Q1 age sediments. The site area falls within the
McNew-Copia-Foxtrot Complex (Natural Resource Conservation Service 2004). An agricultural
soil survey of El Paso County identified all soils in the area as part of the Hueco Wink
Association (Jaco 1971:24, Sheet 43). The site is located within the La Mesa geomorphic surface
within Mapping Unit 2a as described by Monger (1993) as containing large dunes generally
larger than 1 m in height with interdunal sheet deposits (Monger 1993:37).
Surface Artifact Assemblage
The surface artifact assemblage consisted of chipped stone, chipped-stone tools and
manufacturing items, ceramics, and groundstone (Table 6.5). One hundred percent of the surface
artifacts were collected during a previous project (Mauldin et al. 1998, Fort Bliss Project 90-11).
During the current project, 100 percent of artifacts located on the site surface were collected.
Complete analysis was performed for all materials collected from the site during the previous
(Mauldin et al. 1998, Fort Bliss Project 90-11) and current project.
The chipped-stone debitage artifacts identified on the surface of 41EP970 (FB 7520) during both
projects included flakes (n = 265) and a few pieces of angular debitage (n = 22). The flakes were
primarily found in four major concentrations that accounted for 80 percent of the total number of
flakes found on the surface. The remaining flakes (20 percent) were scattered throughout the site.
The largest flake concentration (46 percent) was located in the northwestern portion of the site
over a 124-m by 80-m area, encompassing Feature 67 at the southern end and Feature 2 at the
northern end. The high density of flake debitage on the surface of this area is likely due to
exposure since this area of the site is heavily deflated.
Numerous lithic tools (n = 127), including both informal and formal tools, were found on the site
surface during both projects. The informal tools include utilized pieces of angular debitage (n =
8) and utilized flakes (n = 63). Formal tools included marginally retouched tools (n = 36) and
bimarginally retouched tools (n = 3), unifacially shaped tools (n = 8), bifacially shaped tools (n =
2), and projectile points (n = 7). All seven of the projectile points were collected; four by

O’Hara (1988:309) and Justice (2002:126), one complete Formative period-style, straightstemmed, obsidian arrow point (CN 128) that resembles a Border Star I (O’Hara 1988:319:203-1)
or a Guadalupe variant of the Livermore cluster (Justice 2002:233), and a Late Paleo-Indian style
(Justice 2002:79) midsection (CN 353).
These four projectile points were located in different areas of the site. The San Jose-type (CN 2)
was located against the west margin of the site closest to recently discovered Feature 79 and
Feature 80. The Bajada-like point (CN 380) was collected out of the roadbed in the northwestern
portion of the site, 7.8 m south of Feature 2. The Formative-style point (CN 128) was collected
from the southeastern portion of the site, close to Excavation Block 8, and the Late Paleo-Indian
style midsection (CN 353) was recovered from the northwestern portion of the site in a highly
deflated area southeast of Feature 5. Three projectile points were collected during the current
project from the surface and one was collected subsurface.
One projectile point (CN 794; see Figure 6.2) was collected subsurface from within Feature 74.
The projectile point is a complete obsidian piece, although its specific form was difficult to
identify. It is likely a small San Pedro-type (Carmichael 1986:95 and Justice 2002:199 Figure
25:18), based on its general form and the recovery of a radiocarbon date from Feature 74 that
dates to the Late Archaic period.

Other lithic tools included cores (n = 30), and angular (n = 12) and rounded (n = 14)
hammerstones. Most of the cores were found in a main concentration in the northwest portion of
the site, the remaining cores were scattered across the sites. The hammerstones were found in the
northwestern, central, and south central portion of the site. Some of the collected tools included
two choppers (CN 577 and CN 782), a unimarginal tool (CN 703), and an agave knife (CN 696;
Figures 6.3 and 6.4).
Groundstone items recovered from the site included one complete mano, mano fragments (n =
53), metate fragments (n = 117), mano/metate fragments (n = 7), indeterminate groundstone
fragments (n = 61), and two anvil fragments (n = 2). The complete mano was isolated on the
western edge of the site, 11 m southwest of Feature 60. One anvil fragment was found in the
southwestern portion of the site and the other was found 3 m southeast of Feature 53. The mano,
metate, and indeterminate fragments were generally found in the northern portion of the site.
Thermal materials on the site were predominately located in the northern portion of the site along
a military access road; many have been reduced to small fragments by tracked vehicles and are
estimated to number over 500 pieces. Most of the fire-cracked rock pieces are small fragments of
groundstone without the remains of a ground surface. Approximately 100 additional scattered
thermal materials were found on the site and are from nearby thermal features or are the remains
of thermal features once present or buried.
Subsurface Artifact Assemblage
Subsurface artifacts were predominately recovered during the current investigations (Table 6.6),
only 25 artifacts were collected subsurface during Fort Bliss Project 90-11 (Mauldin et al. 1998).
The cultural materials recovered subsurface during the current investigations were predominately
within Excavation Block 6 and associated with Feature 74, and from Excavation Block 8. This
clustering of subsurface artifacts generally corresponds with clusters of surface artifacts noted in
this south central portion of the site.

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

Bone fragments were recovered primarily during the current project; all bone recovered was from
subsurface contexts. Only two burned bone fragments were recovered during the previous
assessment of 41EP970 (FB 7520), and these items were from Feature 43 (Mauldin et al. 1998,
Fort Bliss Project 90-11). Forty-nine bone fragments were recovered from subsurface context
during the current project (Appendix F). The majority of the bone fragments (n = 21) were
recovered from Excavation Block 8 but were from the general activity area designated as Feature
81.
Feature 74 contained 17 bone fragments, and the remaining bone fragments were found in
Excavation Block 9 and Excavation Block 14 and were associated with the general mixed
charcoal stain sediments removed from these blocks. The exception was one piece directly
associated with Feature 41 in Excavation Block 14.
Features
Seventy features were identified on 41EP970 (FB 7520) during Fort Bliss Project 90-11 (Mauldin
et al. 1998). All of the previously recorded features, including their original and current
characteristics, are listed in Appendix E. An attempt was made during the current project to
locate these features. Many of the previously recorded surface features (n = 38) were relocated
during the current project. Six of the previously recorded features (Features 41, 44, 51, 55, 56,
and 70) were manually excavated during the current project.
Ten new surface features were identified during the current investigation, and were numbered
sequentially starting with number 71 (Feature 71 through Feature 80). Six of these features
(Feature 72 through Feature 75, Feature 79, and Feature 80) were excavated during the current
project; four (Feature 71, Feature 76, Feature 77, and Feature 78) were not.
Twenty-nine new subsurface features (Features 74.1 through 74.9, Feature 81, Feature 81.1
through 81.5, Features 82 through 90, Feature 90.1, Feature 90.2, Feature 91, Feature 92, and
Feature 92.1) were identified during the current project through hand excavations. Five of the
newly identified, subsurface features (Feature 86, Feature 89, Feature 90, Feature 90.1, and
Feature 90.2) were later identified as natural rather than cultural features. Characteristics of the
excavated or tested features are listed below in Table 6.7.
Previously Recorded Features
Feature 41 was a small charcoal stain feature identified in the east central portion of the site.
Excavation Block 14 was placed over Feature 41 and also uncovered two, small, charcoal stain
hearth features, Feature 88 and Feature 91. Feature 41 was impacted by tracked vehicles and had
been dispersed and deflated. Feature 41 was located in the west portion of the block and was an
80-cm by 70-cm diameter lens of dark charcoal stain sediments. The feature contained a single
indeterminate fragment of burned long bone. A float sample was collected, processed, and
curated.
Feature 44 was identified on the surface as an articulated cluster of burned caliche with charcoal
staining in the south central portion of the site. Intact remains of the feature were exposed
directly beneath the surface. The feature was bisected and entirely excavated. This feature
consisted of 90-cm by 72-cm light gray charcoal stain basin hearth that was oval in plan and
extended 9-cm deep (Figure 6.5). A sample of fill was collected from Feature 44 provided a date
associated with the Mesilla phase of the Formative period (Beta No. 270219, 1580 ± 40 B.P.,
charred material; δ13C = -24.1, cal A.D. 400 to 570, calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C).

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

Figure 6.5. Photograph of Level 1 of Feature 44 on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Feature 51 was identified in the southern portion of the site as a small charcoal stain feature on
the edge of an ephemeral arroyo that flows into a playa. A 16-square meter excavation block
(Excavation Block 13) was located over and south of this feature. Feature 51 was a charcoal stain
hearth that had been truncated by a shallow arroyo. Feature 51 was likely circular and roughly 89
cm in diameter; it was bisected and excavated, all fill was collected. The feature was basin in
plan, extended 11-cm deep, and contained charcoal and a single fire-cracked rock. A sample of
fill was collected from Feature 51 provided a date associated with the Late Archaic period (Beta
No. 270220, 2720 ± 40 B.P., charred material; δ13C = -23.7, cal 930 to 800 B.C., calibrated at 2­
Sigma; see Appendix C).
Feature 55 and Feature 56 were identified as two charcoal stain features on the site surface during
the original recording (Mauldin et al. 1998) of 41EP970 (FB 7520). During the current
investigation, these two features were not visible on the site surface but were buried under an
average of 30 to 50 cm of recent eolian sands. These two features were initially encountered in
BHT 5; BHS 1 was then excavated to uncover these features. A 4-m by 4-m excavation block
(Excavation Block 9) was established over these features and uncovered a small circular hearth
(Feature 55), a dispersed stain (Feature 56), and a brush structure (Feature 92) with an associated
central floor hearth (Feature 92.1). Feature 55 was a circular charcoal stain that was likely an
extramural hearth of Feature 92. Feature 55 was basin in plan, was 42 cm by 39 cm in size, and
extended 10-cm deep. No artifacts were found within Feature 55. A float sample was collected,
processed, and curated.
Feature 56 had been heavily impacted and dispersed by tracked vehicles and likely represented
another thermal feature. The dispersed remains of Feature 56 extended more than 2.4 m by 1 m

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

in size and were a 5-cm thick lens of charcoal stained sediments. The cultural material recovered
from Feature 56 consisted of a single flake. A float sample was collected, processed, and curated.
Feature 70 was a small charcoal stain initially noted on the site surface in 1990 (Mauldin et al.
1998). A 2-m by 4-m excavation block (Excavation Block 12) was established over Feature 70
during the current project and revealed a large charcoal stain feature that extended 3.3 m by more
than 1.5-m east of the block under a mesquite dune (Figure 6.6). A backhoe scrape (BHS 4) was
then excavated beside Excavation Block 12 to remove the dune. Unfortunately, the upper portion
of this shallow pithouse structure was accidently removed by the backhoe.

Figure 6.6. Photograph of Level 1 of Feature 70 on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Newly Recorded Features
Feature 71 was identified on the surface as a 30-cm diameter charcoal stain with five small pieces
of burned caliche in the eastern portion of the site. The feature was trowel tested, extended only
5-cm deep, and lacked charcoal chunks. This feature was not excavated given the lack of cultural
materials recovered nearby, the shallow nature of the stain, and the lack of charcoal to provide a
radiocarbon date.
Feature 72 and Feature 73 were identified on the surface of the site. A 4-m by 4-m block
excavation (Excavation Block 8) was placed over these features and revealed numerous other
features and an activity area present below the modern surface. The block excavation was
expanded to cover a 16-m by 12-m area and revealed Feature 81, Feature 81.1 through Feature
81.5, and Feature 82 through Feature 87. An initial level exposed a dispersed light charcoal stain

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

initially thought to represent structural remains (Feature 81) and defined Feature 72 and Feature
73. Feature 72 was the only feature identified on the surface of Excavation Block 8, and was 8
cm above Feature 85 and Feature 86 and 5 to 13-cm above Feature 82 and Feature 83. The intact
portion of Feature 72 was identified 5 cm below the surface as an 85 cm by 84 cm, black charcoal
stain hearth that was circular in plan. The feature was bisected and basin in profile, extending a
maximum of 24-cm deep. No artifacts were present within the feature fill. A sample of fill was
collected from Feature 72 provided a date associated with the Late Archaic period of the
Formative period (Beta No. 270222, 2740 ± 40 B.P., charred material; δ13C = -24.5, cal 980 to 810
B.C, calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C).
Feature 73 was a large, dark gray to black charcoal stain roasting pit that was oval in plan. The
feature was 1.3-m by 1.11-m in size and was a deep, basin pit that extended a maximum of 39-cm
deep (Figure 6.7). A sample of fill was collected from Feature 73 provided dates associated with
the Middle Archaic period (Beta No. 270223, 3710 ± 40 B.P., charred material; δ13C = -24.5, cal
2200 to 2010 B.C. and 2000 to 1980 B.C., calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C).

Figure 6.7. Photograph of Feature 73 (bisected) on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Feature 74 was exposed below the surface as a large, dark gray charcoal stain that was oval in
plan and extended over a 2.8-m by 2.04-m area. The feature was bisected and identified as
containing a basin-shaped floor with an area of 4.60-square meters that extended a maximum of
23-cm deep and contained a subfloor and surrounding associated features (Feature 74.1 through
Feature 74.9; Figure 6.8 and Figure 6.9).
Excavation of this feature and the surrounding excavation block identified a central floor hearth
(Feature 74.6) and two interior postholes within the brush “hut” structure. One of the interior
postholes was in the east central portion of the structure beside the floor hearth (Feature 74.7) and
the other was in the west central portion of the structure (Feature 74.9; Figure 6.10).

Feature 75 was a small, burned caliche and charcoal stain feature that was excavated in a single
cultural level in Excavation Block 11; all fill was collected although there was not enough
charcoal to provide a radiocarbon date. BHS 5 was excavated north and east of Excavation Block
11. Artifacts found within the feature fill consisted of three flakes. Some scattered charcoal
staining and additional subsurface pieces of burned caliche were uncovered in BHS 5 located just
north of Feature 75, which may represent discard from Feature 75. A float sample was collected,
processed, and curated.
Feature 76 was a scatter of 37 pieces of burned caliche in a 2-m diameter area, located in the
northwestern portion of the site. The feature was situated on a deflated surface that had been
severely impacted by vehicle traffic through this area. The feature lacked subsurface cultural
remains and charcoal stained sediments and was not excavated.
Feature 77 was identified on the site surface as a 30-cm diameter charcoal stain that extended
more than 10-cm deep. The feature was situated on a dune margin in the northeastern portion of
the site. The feature lacked visible charcoal chunks and the stained remains were only the
remains of a feature that had since eroded downslope. The feature was not excavated.
Feature 78 was identified on the site surface as a 1-m diameter dark gray to black charcoal stain
feature on the slope of a dune located in the northeastern portion of the site. The feature
contained charcoal and charcoal stained sediments to a depth that exceeded 10 cm below the
present surface. The feature was not excavated.
Feature 79 and Feature 80 were two small charcoal stain hearth features identified on the surface
of 41EP970 (FB 7520). A relatively large block (Excavation Block 10) was excavated over these
features to expose intact remains and recover any subsurface associated cultural materials (Figure
6.11). The intact remains of Feature 79 were identified 5 cm below the surface as an oval 93-cm
6-21

by 78-cm basin pit that was 18-cm deep. The feature consisted of a dark gray to black charcoal
stain; no subsurface artifacts were found. Only the south half of this feature was excavated. A
sample of fill was collected from Feature 79 provided a date associated with the Late Archaic
period (Beta No. 270225, 2840 ± 50 B.P., charred material; δ13C = -25.6, cal 1130 to 900 B.C.,
calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C). The light fraction was submitted to Shumla
Archeobotanical Services for macrobotanical analysis; results of this analysis is presented in
Appendix D.

Figure 6.11. Photograph showing Feature 79 and Feature 80, Level 1, on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Feature 80 was a slightly smaller charcoal stain identified on the surface northeast of Feature 79.
The intact remains of Feature 80 were identified 3 cm below the surface. Feature 80 was a 14-cm
deep basin pit that extended 63 cm by 45 cm and was oval in plan. Only the south half of this
feature was excavated. The feature fill lacked artifacts. A sample of fill was collected from
Feature 1 provided a date associated with the Late Archaic period (Beta No. 270226, 2640 ± 40
13
B.P., charred material; δ C = -24.2, cal 840 to 780 B.C., calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C).
A 4-m by 4-m block excavation (Excavation Block 8) that was placed over surface Feature 72
and Feature 73 revealed Feature 81, Feature 81.1 through Feature 81.5, and Feature 82 through
Feature 87. Feature 81 was initially thought to represent a structure; however, subsequent
excavations identified this large, light gray, charcoal stain feature to likely represent either an
activity area or dispersed staining from multiple thermal features that were in close proximity to
Feature 81. The cultural fill of Feature 81 extended from a few cm thick to 45-cm deep. The
deepest deposits of Feature 81 were located in the southern portion of the feature where Features
81.1 through 81.5 were located (Figure 6.12). Feature 81 represented occupations associated with
the early portions of the Late Archaic period, as identified through radiocarbon dating of Feature
81.1, Feature 81.3, Feature 81.4, and Feature 83.

Figure 6.12. Photograph of Feature 81.1 on 41EP970 (FB 7520), showing Feature 81.4 and
Feature 81.5 stratigraphically positioned above Feature 81.1.
Feature 81.1 was identified in the southern portion of Excavation Block 8 at the lowest
stratigraphic level of Feature 81. The feature was a hearth that was circular in plan and basin in
profile. Feature 81.1 extended 65 cm in diameter and was 6-cm deep. The feature contained one
hammerstone fragment, two metate fragments, and one indeterminate groundstone fragment, as
well as 12 pieces of burned caliche within the matrix; all were last utilized for their thermal
properties. A sample of fill was collected from Feature 81.1 provided a date associated with the
Late Archaic period (Beta No. 270227, 2840 ± 40 B.P., charred material; δ13C = -24.5, cal 1120 to
910 B.C., calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C).
Feature 81.2 was a 22-cm diameter, light gray charcoal stain hearth that was circular in plan and
basin in profile. The feature only extended 2-cm deep and was the eroded basal elements of a
hearth. No artifacts were present within the fill of Feature 81.2. A float sample was collected,
processed, and curated.
Feature 81.3 was 80 cm in length by 68-cm wide. The feature was oval in plan, cylindrical in
profile, and extended 20-cm deep. The feature was lined with thermal materials along the
western and northern margins (Figure 6.13). The feature contained three metate fragments
utilized for their thermal properties to partially line the pit. Feature 81.3 is a deep roasting pit
consisting of light gray brown charcoal stain sediments in the upper 10 to 12 cm of fill and black
charcoal stain sediment with a high density of charcoal in the lower portion of the pit. A sample
of fill was collected from Feature 81.3 provided dates associated with the Late Archaic period
(Beta No. 270228, 2810 ± 40 B.P., charred material; δ13C = -24.0, cal 1050 to 890 B.C. and 870 to
850 B.C., calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C). The remaining light fraction from this float
sample was submitted to Shumla Archeobotanical Services for macrobotanical analysis; results of
this analysis are presented in Appendix D.

Figure 6.13. Photograph of Feature 81.3 (bisected) on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Feature 81.4 was also identified in Excavation Block 8, but was 9 cm higher than Feature 81.1,
Feature 81.2, and Feature 81.3. Feature 81.4 was at the same stratigraphic level as Feature 81.5
and situated 18-cm west of Feature 81.5. Feature 81.4 was a 7-cm deep hearth that was circular
in plan and basin in profile that extended 40-cm by 36-cm. The feature fill consisted of a dark
gray/black charcoal stain sand with a high quantity of gray powdery ash with large chunks of
charcoal and lacked artifacts. A sample of fill was collected from Feature 81.4 provided dates
associated with the Late Archaic period (Beta No. 270229, 2860 ± 40 B.P., charred material; δ13C
= -23.6, cal 1130 to 920 B.C., calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C).
Feature 81.5 was identified at the same stratigraphic level as Feature 81.4 in Excavation Block 8.
Feature 81.5 was a small hearth that was 40 cm in diameter, 10-cm deep, circular in plan, and
basin in profile. The fill of Feature 81.5 consisted of a black, charcoal laden soil that contained
two pieces of limestone fire-cracked rocks. The feature was not radiocarbon dated, but given its
location at the same stratigraphic level as Feature 81.4, it is likely contemporaneous. A float
sample was collected and processed. This sample was submitted to Shumla Archeobotanical
Services for macrobotanical analysis; results of this analysis are presented in Appendix D.
Feature 82 was identified 40 cm southeast of Feature 83, at roughly the same stratigraphic level
(Figure 6.14). The upper portion of this hearth feature had been dispersed by eolian erosion and
only the lower 15 cm of the feature was intact. This portion was oval in plan, basin in profile,
extended 89 cm by 73 cm, and was 28-cm deep. The feature consisted of light to dark gray
brown charcoal stained sediments with charcoal; no artifacts were found in the fill. A float
sample was collected, processed, and curated.

Figure 6.14. Photograph of Excavation Block 8, Level 2, on 41EP970 (FB 7520) showing the
varying depths of Features 72, 82, 83, 84, and 85.
Feature 83 was identified at the base of Level 1 in Excavation Block 8, but was clearly defined at
the base of Level 2. Feature 83 was a 22-cm deep, basin-shaped pit that was oval in plan and was
94-cm in length and 81-cm wide. The feature was a moderate sized hearth that consisted of a
light to dark gray, charcoal stain; no artifacts were found within the fill. The feature originated
near or at the top of the anthrosol or “A” humic horizon, stratigraphically positioned well above
Feature 81.1 through Feature 81.5. A sample of fill was collected from Feature 83 provided dates
associated with the Late Archaic period (Beta No. 270231, 2810 ± 40 B.P., charred material; δ13C
= -24.4, cal 1050 to 890 B.C. and 870 to 850 B.C., calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C). The
remaining light fraction from this float sample was submitted to Shumla Archeobotanical
Services for macrobotanical analysis; results of this analysis are presented in Appendix D.
Feature 84 was identified at the base of Level 2 in Excavation Block 8. Feature 84 was a 7-cm
deep, patchy dark gray charcoal stain that was irregular to circular in plan and was 70 cm by 60
cm in size. This feature likely represents discard or deflated/dispersed remains from Feature 83
to the west. The only cultural material associated with Feature 84 consisted of a single, small
piece of burned caliche. A float sample was collected, processed, and curated.
Feature 85 was identified in Excavation Block 8 just north of Feature 72. The feature was a large
dark gray charcoal stain with scattered charcoal at the base of Level 2 The feature was defined
13-cm below Level 2 as a 75-cm by 68-cm, deep basin hearth that was 25-cm deep. These
dimensions represented the intact portions of Feature 85. The upper extent of this feature was
dispersed and deflated by eolian erosion. No artifacts were found within the feature fill. A float
sample was collected, processed, and curated.
Feature 86 was identified at the base of Level 1 in Excavation Block 8 as a small, circular, ashy
stain with some scattered charcoal in the upper 10 cm. The feature was 22-cm by 20-cm in size,
was circular in plan, cylindrical in profile, and extended 76 cm below the base of Level 1. The
fill was an ashy type matrix that was identified as a decayed Yucca elata root. A float sample was
collected, processed, and curated.

6-25

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

Feature 87 was the basal elements of roasting pit identified at the base of Level 2 in Excavation
Block 8. The feature was 1.29 m by 1.07 m in size and irregular to oval shaped in plan, with a
basin-shaped profile that extended 12-cm deep. The feature fill consisted of a dark gray brown
charcoal stain with scattered charcoal that contained 16 pieces of burned caliche and no
subsurface artifacts. A float sample was collected, processed, and curated. Although this feature
was not radiocarbon dated, it is likely contemporaneous with Feature 85 and Feature 72, which
were located just south of Feature 87.
Feature 88 was a light charcoal stain hearth located in Excavation Block 14. The feature was an
8-cm deep pit that was 74-cm by 55-cm in size, oval in plan, and basin in profile. Excavations
recovered 11 flakes, one utilized flake, eight bone fragments, and six small pieces of burned
caliche within Feature 88. A sample of fill was collected from Feature 88 provided a date
associated with the early Mesilla phase of the Formative period (Beta No. 270232, 1640 ± 40 B.P.,
charred material; δ13C = -24.7, cal A.D. 330 to 540, calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C).
Feature 89 was a 400-cm long charcoal stain that was 5-cm thick that was uncovered subsurface
in the western wall of BHT 7. Examination of this stain revealed the feature to be due to rodent
activity. The stained material was likely the transported remains from a nearby feature. The
charcoal stain remains within this rodent burrow were not excavated.
Feature 90, Feature 90.1, and Feature 90.2 were all identified in BHT 12. These features included
a dark brown, faint charcoal stain, basin pit feature (Feature 90), a smaller basin pit feature
(Feature 90.1), and a cylindrical pit (Feature 90.2). All three features were within brown sandy
loam deposits identified as Q3 sediment, although no cultural evidence was found in any of the
three features. Float samples were collected, processed, and curated from Feature 90.1 and
Feature 90.2.
Feature 91 was located in Excavation Block 14 and consisted of an oval, dark charcoal stain
hearth. Feature 91 was 80 cm by 63 cm in size, 7-cm deep, and was basin shaped. This feature
was impacted by tracked vehicles and had been dispersed and deflated. A float sample was
collected, processed, and curated.
Features 92 and 92.1 were identified in Excavation Block 9 that was established over previously
recorded Features 55 and 56. The subsequent excavations uncovered a brush structure (Feature
92) and associated central floor hearth (Feature 92.1). Feature 92 was oval in plan and extended
2.05-m north/south by 1.56-m east/west. The feature was 12-cm deep, basin in profile, and
encompassed a 2.56-square meter area. Feature 92.1 was identified in the north central portion of
Feature 92. The floor hearth was 62 cm by 60 cm in size, 13 cm deep, circular in plan, and basin
in profile. Float samples were collected from both features. A sample of fill was collected from
Feature 92.1 provided dates associated with the Late Archaic period (Beta No. 270233, 2810 ± 40
13
B.P., charred material; δ C = -24.0, cal 1050 to 890 B.C. and 870 to 850 B.C., calibrated at 2­
Sigma; see Appendix C).
Mechanical Excavation
Twelve backhoe trenches and six backhoe scrapes were excavated at 41EP970 (FB 7520; Table
6.8) during the current project. The trenches were placed in various areas of the site to explore
subsurface deposits while the backhoe scrapes were placed in some areas to facilitate excavation
of features identified through hand excavations and to determine whether additional features were
present in certain portions of the site (Figure 6.15 and Figure 6.16). Six of the backhoe trenches
were excavated in the southern portion of the site where intact remains of features and the
majority of excavation blocks were located. The remaining six backhoe trenches were distributed
across the northern and central areas of the site.

Backhoe Trench 1 (BHT 1) was located approximately 3 m east of Excavation Block 8 in an area
containing extensive dune sheet sands. This trench was excavated to determine if the subsurface,
cultural bearing deposits identified in Excavation Block 8 continued to the east. The trench was
excavated to a maximum of 1.5-m wide and 1.7-m deep. A buried soil (Q3Ab) was preserved
under approximately 40 cm of recently deposited Q4 sands. Although this horizon lacked
cultural materials, it was thought to be contiguous with the cultural bearing sediments in
Excavation Block 8 and was exposed during the time the site was occupied. Weakly expressed
calcium carbonate filaments were noted in the lower strata of the trench profile; however, no
well-developed calcic horizons were noted.
Backhoe Trench 2 (BHT 2) was located 39 m south/southwest of BHT 1 in another area of very
extensive dune sheet sands. Recent eolian sands were up to 1 m in depth within this trench. BHT
2 was excavated to 1.3 m below the present ground surface (Appendix B)

6-29

Backhoe Trench 3 (BHT 3) was located near the southern end of the site in another area of
extensive dune sheet sands. It was 4.5 m south of Feature 70 in Excavation Block 12. This
trench was excavated 1.5 m below the surface and exposed a buried Q3Ab horizon underneath
recent eolian sands (Figure 6.17). Stratigraphically, this horizon was associated with a cultural
prehistoric occupation noted to the northwest (Feature 70); however, this trench did not contain
any cultural materials.

Figure 6.17. Stratigraphic profile of BHT 3 on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Backhoe Trench 4 (BHT 4) was located 13 m west of Excavation Block 11 in an interdunal area
bisected by a shallow arroyo or ephemeral drainage. The trench verified a lack of cultural
deposits and shallow deposits in this portion of the site, which ranged from 32-cm to 60-cm deep
into (Q1) caliche bearing deposits (Figure 6.18).
Backhoe Trench 5 (BHT 5) was originally excavated in the location where previously recorded
Feature 55 and Feature 56 had been noted (Mauldin et al. 1998, Fort Bliss Project 90-11),
although neither of the features was visible on the surface during the current project. These
features were encounter at 30 to 60 cm below the present surface during excavation of BHT 5 and
excavation was terminated and shifted roughly 5 m west to excavate below the depth of these
features.
The area where Feature 55 and Feature 56 were encountered was then scraped down to the depth
of these features (Backhoe Scrape 1). BHT 5 was excavated to 1 m below the modern ground
surface and did not uncover any subsurface cultural bearing sediment. Potential prehistoric
bearing deposits (Q3) were deep within the dune but shallow at the northern end of BHT 5 within
a deflated interdunal depression (see Appendix B).

Backhoe Trench 6 (BHT 6) was excavated in the west central portion of the site into a dune
located 9 m east of Feature 59 and 10 m south of Feature 64. The trench contained an upper
humic bearing lens above roughly 60-cm deep Q3 BK1 sediment, but no buried cultural evidence
was noted. BHT 6 was excavated to 1 m below the surface and contained a Q3Bk2 deposit at the
base of the trench (Figure 6.19).

Figure 6.19. Stratigraphic profile of BHT 6 on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Backhoe Trench 7 (BHT 7) was located in the southern portion of the site, 10 m north of Feature
44 in another area containing extensive dune sheet sands. This trench uncovered an intact
subsurface cultural horizon within the Q3Ab unit. This cultural horizon was defined by darker
fill, pieces of burned caliche, and scattered charcoal roughly 50 cm below the surface and 50 cm
below the location of Feature 44, indicating stratified deposits of variable prehistoric occupations
are present in this portion of the site as uncovered in Excavation Block 8 to the south (Figure
6.20).

Backhoe Trench 8 (BHT 8) was excavated 5.6 m north of Excavation Block 14, which contained
Feature 41, Feature 48, and Feature 91. This location was in an area that contained dune sheet
sands. This area also contained a thin layer of Q3Ab under a thin mantle of recent eolian sands
above a shallow 35 cm deep Q3Bk1 deposits over more than 25 cm of Q3Bk2 deposits. The
trench was excavated to 75 cm below the surface; no buried cultural material was found in BHT
8.
Backhoe Trench 9 (BHT 9) was excavated 4 m south of Feature 31 in an area that contained dune
sheet sands. This trench was excavated to 80 cm below the surface, lacked recent eolian sands,
and contained a thin, 15-cm lens of Q3A over roughly 45 cm of Q3Bk1 deposits, which were
over more than 15 cm of Q3Bk2 deposits (Figure 6.21).

Figure 6.21. Stratigraphic profile of BHT 9 on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Backhoe Trench 10 (BHT 10) was excavated 22 m west/northwest of BHT 9, in an area of dune
sheet sands located between two deflated interdunal areas. These areas contained Feature 15,
Feature 33, Feature 34, and Feature 63. BHT 10 did contain a thin cultural bearing lens roughly

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

5-m thick below a 20-cm thick horizon of recently deposited, Q4 eolian sand deposits (Figure
6.22). The trench was excavated to 85 cm below the surface and contained a 15-cm thick Q3A/B
horizon under the cultural bearing humic lens that was above a 25 cm of a Q3Bk1 deposit over a
more than 15-cm thick Q3Bk2 deposit.

Figure 6.22. Stratigraphic profile of BHT 10 on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Backhoe Trench 11 (BHT 11) was excavated 11 m north of a heavily utilized, east/west-trending
dirt road that had eroded deeply into caliche bearing sediments. BHT 11 was excavated to 90 cm
below the surface within a large, mesquite-stabilized dune. This trench contained a thin 10-cm
lens of recent eolian sand (Q4) over a 5-cm thick Q3Ab, that was above 45 cm of Q3Bk1 and
more than 20 cm of Q3Bk2 (Figure 6.23).

Backhoe Trench 12 (BHT 12) was placed in the northwestern corner of the site within a heavily
impacted area to expand subsurface investigations near a previously recorded, Early Archaic
dated hearth (Feature 2). The trench revealed a disturbed and altered 10 to 50 cm lens of recent
deposited eolian sands (Q4) over a 10 to 20 cm thick Q3Ab that was above a 5-cm to 20-cm thick
Q3Bk1 horizon (see Appendix B). A light gray, basin-shaped, possible charcoal stain was
identified in the east wall of the south end of the trench, closest to Feature 2 (Figure 6.24).

Figure 6.24. Photograph of BHT 12 showing Feature 90 on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
In additional, a small cylindrical pit and a basin-shaped pit (Feature 90.1 and Feature 90.2) were
also recorded in this trench. These potential features were excavated by hand. None of these
features contained charcoal and all three may have been a result of Feature 2 being scattered and
deflated during alteration of the landscape in this portion of the site by the U.S. Army in the
1940s or 1950s.
Approximately 98 cubic meters of fill were moved during the excavation of these trenches.
Cultural deposits were identified in only BHT 7, BHT 10, and BHT 12. The remaining trenches
lacked cultural evidence. Overall, trenching identified three geomorphic areas within the site.
Trenches near the east margin of the site lacked developed caliche dominated substrate. In
addition, these trenches generally contained thick Q4 horizons over a humic/anthromorphic
horizon over a deep Q3 sediment with only traces of caliche filaments.
The humic/anthromorphic horizons were located in large dune fields. Coppice dunes in this area
constitute less than 20 percent of these dune fields. Interdune areas in this portion of the site have
been deflated to the base of the humic/anthromorphic lens and it is at the base or within this lens
of sediment that cultural features and artifacts were located. It was noted in Excavation Block 8,
located just west of BHT 1, that cultural features were positioned at variable stratigraphic levels
related to the humic/anthromorphic horizon with some near the top and others at the base, often
separated by 20-cm to 30-cm of eolian deposits.
Trenching in the central to western margin of the site identified caliche bearing sediments or
Q2/Q1 sediments at variable depths related to coppice dunes. These sediments ranged from 30
cm to 60 cm below the surface in interdune areas. Coppice dunes and the associated talus slopes
of the mesquite dunes were noted in this area to also contain a thin humic/anthromorphic cultural
lens below recent eolian sand deposits, which were above a moderately thick (40 cm to 1 m) Q3
sediment with increasing calcium carbonate formation with increasing depth below the surface.

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

Intact feature remains were few in this portion of the site and limited to small “islands” within
coppice dunes.
The final geomorphic area of the site is located within a large disturbed portion of the desert floor
in the northwestern portion of the site. BHT 12 was excavated in this area and verified coppice
dunes had been removed in this area. Disturbed eolian deposits are present near the surface and
extend down to a dispersed and disturbed humic lens that may have formed after the area had
been denuded for military training. This cleared area affected only the far western and northwest
margins of the site, although impacts from military traffic are much more extensive and caliche
dominated substrate or hardpan surfaces just above caliche are exposed throughout this portion of
the site.
The six backhoe scrapes on this site included four that were excavated to facilitate hand
excavations (Backhoe Scrapes 1, 2, 3, and 6) and two that were excavated to verify the lack of
additional buried features near hand excavations (Backhoe Scrapes 4 and 5). Data concerning
these backhoe scrapes is listed below in Table 6.9.

Backhoe Scrape 1 (BS 1) was located over previously recorded Feature 55 and Feature 56 in the
southern portion of the site to remove up to a meter of recent eolian sands that had buried these
features since they were first discovered in 1990 (Mauldin et al. 1998, Fort Bliss Project 90-11).
Backhoe Scrape 2 (BS 2) removed up to 30 cm of recently deposited eolian sands south and west
of Excavation Block 8 to assist in the excavation of Feature 81. Backhoe Scrape 3 (BS 3) was
excavated 11 m north of Feature 74 in Excavation Block 6 to facilitate uncovering the edge of the
feature. Up to a meter of recent eolian sands was removed and charcoal stain sediments were
uncovered at the northeastern end of BS 3. However, the stained sediments were dispersed and a
formal feature could not be defined.
Backhoe Scrape 4 (BS 4) was excavated adjacent to Excavation Block 12 to assist in uncovering
the eastern portion of Feature 70. Unfortunately, Feature 70 was beneath a mesquite bush and
was covered by a meter of recent eolian sands. It was difficult to discern the feature’s extent once
the mesquite had been removed due to extensive root disturbance. The scrape extended 13 m
north/northeast of Feature 70. Feature 70 was also difficult to discern since the area had been
extremely bioturbated; however, a faint charcoal stain identified as a hut structure was
documented.
Backhoe Scrape 5 (BS 5) was excavated in an area of interdunal sheet sands north and east of
Excavation Block 11 and Feature 75 to determine if any additional subsurface cultural evidence
was present in this area. The scrape did uncover some scattered pieces of burned caliche roughly
2 to 4 m north of the excavation block, but no additional intact subsurface features or remains
were encountered. Backhoe Scrape 6 (BS 6) removed up to 30 cm of recent eolian sands next to
BHT 12 in the northwestern portion of the site to determine whether faint charcoal stain sediment

identified at the base of Q4 sediments in the east wall of BHT 12 represented intact feature
remains; no feature was found.
Manual Excavation
During the current project, manual excavations on this site were situated where intact feature
remains were observed, generally in the southern portion of the site, with the exception of one
excavation block (Excavation Block 10) in the western portion of the site, one in the central
(Excavation Block 14), and one in the northwestern portion of the site (Excavation Block 15). A
total of 15 excavation blocks have been excavated on 41EP970 (FB 7520). Previously, five
blocks were excavated on the site (Mauldin et al. 1998, Fort Bliss Project 90-11); these blocks
were identified as Excavation Block 1 through 5 during the current project. Another 10 manual
excavation blocks totaling 215.3-square meters were excavated during the current project
(Excavation Blocks 5 through 15). Data concerning each of these excavation blocks are
presented in Table 6.10 and in Appendix B (see Appendix B).
Previous Manual Excavation
The five manual block excavations performed during Fort Bliss Project 90-11 (Mauldin et al.
1998:246) were placed over five surface identified features (Features 2, Feature 27, Feature 29,
Feature 43, and Feature 67). Feature 2 was the intact basal elements of a roasting pit and the
other four were the deflated remains of thermal features. Some of the blocks were manually
excavated in a single natural level and others in arbitrary levels. These excavation blocks were
excavated in 1-m by 1-m grid units rather than 2-m by 2-m grid units utilized during the current
project.
Excavation Block 1 was placed over Feature 2, which was located in the northwestern portion of
the site, in an area altered by the military in the 1940s to 1950s. The excavation forms (Mauldin
et al. 1998) described the feature as exposed on the surface in the lower Q3 sediments, just above
Q1 caliche dominated substrate and extended mainly into the caliche-dominated substrate (Figure
6.25).

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

A total of six-square meters was excavated north and east of Feature 2 where semi-compact to
unconsolidated sediments remained around the feature set into a very compact substrate. These
excavations consisted of a single natural level removing unconsolidated light brown eolian sands
down to a dark brown sandy loam representative of an “A” horizon/humic lens above thin Q3
sediment (0 cm to 34 cm). No cultural materials were present. Feature 2 was radiocarbon dated
Mauldin et al. 1998:462) and provided a date of 5620 ± 80 B.P. (Beta 50092, cal 4690 - 4330 B.C.,
calibrated at 2-Sigma).
Excavation Block 2 was placed over Feature 27, a concentration of burned caliche and firecracked rocks located in the northwestern portion of the site (Fort Bliss Site File Records [1990],
excavation forms; Fort Bliss Project 90-11). The excavation block covered a 12-square meter
area; a fair amount of subsurface artifacts (23 lithic artifacts) and thermal materials (n = 604;
1.0205 kg) were recovered from Excavation Block 2 although no charcoal staining was identified.
Excavation consisted of a single arbitrary level that removed unconsolidated light brown eolian
sands down to and into a semi-compact sandy loam (2 cm to 17 cm).
Excavation Block 3 was placed over Feature 43 in the central portion of the site and consisted of
a 2-m by 2-m area (Fort Bliss Site File Records [1990], excavation forms; Fort Bliss Project 90­
11). This feature was located high on a dune margin, 20 cm below a humic lens, and was
suggested to represent the deflated remains of a hearth. Two unidentified burned bone fragments
were recovered from this excavation (Stratton 1998:420). Feature 43 was a small, 39-cm by 27­
cm oval charcoal stain that revealed an 8-cm deep basin pit. The block was excavated in a single
arbitrary level, initially removing unconsolidated and semi compact sediments down to the top of
Feature 43 (10-cm to 48-cm deep). Two of the units were arbitrarily excavated in a second level
to a similar uniform depth (0 cm to 42 cm) below datum.
Excavation Block 4 was placed over Feature 67 in the northwestern portion of the site and
consisted of a 2-m by 2-m area (Fort Bliss Site File Records [1990], excavation forms; Fort Bliss
Project 90-11). Feature 67 was a small, 50 cm by 50 cm, irregular charcoal stain that was only 1­
cm thick. The feature was described as the deflated remains of a hearth. The unit was dug in a
single arbitrary level (3-cm to 11-cm deep) that excavated through cultural deposits identified on
the surface and lacked subsurface cultural materials.
Excavation Block 5 was placed over Feature 29 in the northwest portion of the site and was a 2-m
by 3-m excavation block (Fort Bliss Site File Records [1990], excavation forms; Fort Bliss
Project 90-11). The block was excavated a single arbitrary level through unconsolidated
sediments and partially into underlying semi-compact Q3 sediments (9-cm to 21-cm). The
excavation recovered a single flake and nine pieces of burned caliche. The feature was a roughly
oval 80 cm by 70 cm charcoal stain that was only 1-cm deep.
Current Manual Excavation
Ten blocks (Excavation Block 6 through Excavation Block 15) were manually excavated during
the current project. Excavation Block 6 was initially a 4-m by 4-m block set up over Feature 74,
which was located in the southern portion of the site (Figure 6.26). An additional 2-m by 2-m
unit was added onto the northeastern portion of the unit to encompass all of Feature 74 as it was
exposed below the surface, thus increasing the size of this excavation block to 20-square meters
The block was excavated a single natural level (2 cm to 64 cm) that exposed Feature 74 in plan
view as an oval, “hut-type” pithouse structure that was 2.8-m by 2-m in size. The pithouse was
then bisected and a single cultural level was excavated, revealing Feature 74 to be 2-cm to 23-cm
deep and basin-shaped, with a central floor hearth (Feature 74.6) and two interior postholes
(Features 74.7 and 74.9). Six postholes (Features 74.1 through 74.5, and 74.8) were identified
exterior to the structure; four of the postholes (Features 74.2, 74.3, 74.4, and 74.8) form a
possible entry into the structure from the east (Figure 6.27).

Figure 6.26. Overview photograph of 41EP970 (FB 7520) showing Excavation Block 6 in
foreground and Excavation Block 8 in background.
A moderate density of cultural materials (6.3 artifacts per square meter) that consisted entirely of
lithic artifacts including a San Pedro-type projectile point similar to one defined by Justice
(2002:199, Figure 25:18) was found in Excavation Block 6. A radiocarbon date obtained from
the floor hearth indicated this structure dates from the Late Archaic period (Beta No. 270224,
2090 ± 40 B.P. δ13C = -22.8‰), cal 200 to 10 B.C, calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C).
Excavation Block 7 was a 2-m by 2-m area placed over previously recorded Feature 44, a 90-cm
by 72-cm hearth. The excavation block was excavated a single natural level removing
unconsolidated sands down to semi-compact brown sands exposing intact remains of Feature 44
(2-cm to 16-cm). Intact remains of Feature 44 were located 2-cm below the surface (Figure
6.28). Feature 44 was bisected and then excavated entirely as a single cultural level. The Level 1
fill of the excavation block contained four flakes and two metate fragments. The feature
contained 275 pieces of burned caliche (4.5 kg). A radiocarbon date from the hearth indicated it
was associated with the Mesilla phase of the Formative period (Beta No. 270219, 1580 ± 40 B.P.,
charred material; δ13C = -24.1‰), cal A.D. 400 to 570, calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C).
Excavation Block 8 was located in the southeastern portion of the site where surface Feature 72
and Feature 73 were identified. Initial natural excavations (Level 1) uncovered a large area with
faint to moderately dark charcoal staining just below eolian sands (Feature 81) and the excavation
area initially set up was expanded to encompass the majority of this activity area/cultural bearing
sediment. The excavation block was expanded to cover a 16-m by 12-m (104-square meter) area
(Figure 6.29). To accomplish this expansion, extensive dune sand overburden (10-cm to 50-cm
deep) to the east and south were removed by mechanical scraping (BHS 2) to assist in exposing
and excavating the activity area (Feature 81). Throughout the excavation block, Level 1 (0 - 25
cm in depth) was excavated through 1 to 3 cm of recently deposited eolian sands into dark brown
to light gray brown charcoal stain sediments (3 - 25 cmbs) in the area of Feature 81.

Figure 6.28. Plan view map of Excavation Block 7 on 41EP970 (FB 7520), showing Feature 44.
Excavation of Level 1 uncovered a portion of Feature 81, and revealed Feature 72, Feature 73,
and Feature 86. Feature 86 was a small, circular, ashy, sand area that was later identified as the
decayed remains of a soaptree yucca.
A second arbitrary level (Level 2) was excavated in the eastern half of Excavation Block 8 (25 60 cm in depth) in an attempt to define Feature 81. Level 2 excavations in Block 8 revealed
Feature 81 as dark brown to dark gray, charcoal-stained sand with scattered charcoal in a 6.4-m
by 5.7-m area. Additional features identified within Level 2 included Feature 82, Feature 83, and
Feature 84 at the northern edge of Feature 81 and Features 85 and 87 further north of Feature 81.
The two other features exposed at the base of Level 1 (Feature 72 and Feature 73) were excavated
as a natural level within Level 2.
A third cultural level was excavated in portions of Excavation Block 8 (Level 3, 0 - 40 cm in
depth) that exposed two additional occupation surfaces and five additional charcoal stain features
(Feature 81.1 through Feature 81.5). These five features were excavated as a cultural level.
However, Feature 81.4 and 81.5 were 8 to 9 cm above Feature 81.1, Feature 8.2, and Feature 81.3
and were identified as later occupation surface. The features identified at the base of Level 2
(Feature 82, Feature 83, Feature 84, Feature 85, and Feature 87) were excavated in their entirety
as a natural level in Level 3.

6-42

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

Figure 6.29. Final plan view map of Excavation Block 8 on 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Overall Excavation Block 8 contained a low density of cultural materials (0.76 artifacts per
square meter; see Table 6.8). The cultural materials were scattered at a low density throughout
the block with the exception ceramics, which were found only in the northwestern portion of the
block. Cultural materials from Excavation Block 8 included flakes, flake debitage, lithic tools,
hammerstones, groundstone, El Paso brownware, burned bone fragments, fire-cracked
rock/burned caliche, and a 1956 cartridge. Radiocarbon dates from the hearths within this
excavation indicate occupations associated with the Middle Archaic period and early part of the
Late Archaic period (Beta Nos. 270222, 270223, 270227 - 270229, and 270231; see Appendix
C).
Excavation Block 9 was a 4-m by 4-m (16-square meter) excavation block placed over an area
where two previously recorded features (Feature 55 and Feature 56) were encountered subsurface
after BHS 1 was excavated. BHT 5 was initially excavated in this area but excavations
uncovered the subsurface remains of Feature 55 and Feature 56 and the trenching was halted.
Feature 55 and Feature 56 were buried by 20 cm up to 1 m of recent eolian sands. Feature 55 was
originally identified as a 42-cm by 39-cm hearth and Feature 56 was a 2.4-m by 1-m hearth.

6-43

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

The hand excavation of Excavation Block 9 involved removal of a natural level of unconsolidated
light brown, recently deposited sands to define Feature 55 and Feature 56 (Level 1, 1-62 cm in
depth). This natural level was evident in the wall of BHT 5. Most of Level 1 was only a few cm
deep, with the exception of the southwestern edge of the block that was 62-cm deep.
A second arbitrary level was excavated (Level 2, 0-8 cm in depth) to further define Feature 55
and 56. Feature 56 was a dispersed (>2.4-m by 1-m) charcoal stain thermal feature that had been
heavily impacted by tracked vehicles prior to the recent investigations and Feature 55 was a small
(42-cm by 39-cm) charcoal stain hearth. Excavation of Level 2 also exposed the remains of a
small (2.05-m by 1.56-m), shallow pithouse (Feature 92) and an associated floor hearth (Feature
92.1; Figure 6.30).

Figure 6.30. Plan view map of Excavation Block 9 on 41EP970 (FB 7520), showing Features 55,
56, 92, and 92.1.
Excavation Block 9 was expanded slightly to the west (1.28 square meters) to define the western
portion of Feature 92. Cultural materials from Excavation Block 9 were present at a low density
(0.29 artifacts per square meter) and included flakes, burned bone fragments, and fire-cracked
rock/burned caliche. A radiocarbon date from the floor hearth (Feature 92.1) provided a date
with associated with the early portion of the Late Archaic period (Beta No. 270233, 2710 ± 40
13
B.P., charred material; δ C = -24.2‰), cal 920 to 800 B.C., calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix
C).
Excavation Block 10 was excavated in the western portion of the site, in an area that contained
surface cultural evidence that extended 51 m west from the main site boundary. The excavation
block was established over surface Feature 79 and surface Feature 80 and extended over 32­
square meters (Figure 6.31). The excavation area was primarily in an interdune area, with the
northwestern edge extending into a coppice dune.
The block was manually excavated in a single natural level (Level 1, 1-37 cm in depth), removing
unconsolidated deposits, and exposing the intact subsurface remains of Feature 79 and Feature
80. Each feature was then bisected and the southern half of each was collected as a float sample.
The density of cultural materials within this excavation block was low (0.22 artifacts per square
meter) and included flakes, and a single tool, metate fragment, and fire-cracked rock.

6-44

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

Radiocarbon date from both the features provided dates associated with the early portion of the
Late Archaic period (Feature 79, Beta No. 270225, and Feature 80, Beta No. 270226; see
Appendix C).

Figure 6.31. Plan view map of Excavation Block 10 on 41EP970 (FB 7520), showing Feature 79
and Feature 80.
Excavation Block 11 consisted of a 2-m by 2-m excavation area placed over a small (40-cm
diameter) burned caliche and charcoal stain feature (Feature 75). This unit was situated atop
some sheets sands that were adjacent to a mesquite-stabilized dune. The block was manually
excavated a single natural level (Level 1, 3 to 13 cm in depth), removing unconsolidated eolian
sands and exposing the intact subsurface remains of Feature 75 (Figure 6.32).
Feature 75 was then excavated in a single cultural level (Level 2) and all fill was collected,
although there was not enough charcoal to provide a radiocarbon date. A moderate density of
cultural materials was recovered (1.75 artifacts per square meter) and included flakes, a tool, a
core, and burned caliche. BHS 5 was excavated north and east of Excavation Block 11. Some
scattered charcoal staining and additional subsurface pieces of burned caliche were uncovered in
this scrape just north of Feature 75 that appeared to represent discard from Feature 75.
Excavation Block 12 was a 2-m by 4-m (8-square meter) area established over previously
recorded Feature 70, a 3.3-m by 1.5-m pithouse. Excavation Block 12 was initially excavated in
a single natural level (Level 1, 3 to 23 cm in depth) that removed unconsolidated light brown
eolian sands and partially exposed Feature 70. At this level, Feature 70 was a faint half circle of
dark brown, charcoal-stained sand. The feature fill extended east outside of the block under a

6-45

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

dune. BHS 6 was then excavated immediately east of Feature 70; unfortunately the backhoe
scraping removed this portion of the feature. A second arbitrary level (Level 2, 2-9 cm) was then
excavated in the eastern half of the block. The margins of Feature 70 were difficult to discern
since the area had been extremely bioturbated; however, a faint charcoal stain identified as
another hut structure was identified (Figure 6.33).

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

Excavation Block 14 was an 8-square meter block situated over previously recorded Feature 41,
an 80-cm by 70-cm hearth (Figure 6.34). The block consisted of one 2-m by 2-m hand unit and
two 1-m by 2-m hand units. The block was excavated a single natural level (Level 1, 1-12 cm),
which removed unconsolidated light brown sand and revealed the subsurface remains of Feature
41 and revealed two new subsurface features, Feature 88 and Feature 91. The two new features
were dispersed charcoal stain thermal features that had been impacted by tracked vehicles.
Feature 88 was a 74-cm by 55-cm hearth and Feature 91 was an 80-cm by 63-cm hearth.

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

A second arbitrary level (Level 2, 0-5 cm) was excavated in the units to further define the three
thermal features. A low density of cultural materials was recovered from the excavation block
(1.5 artifacts per square meter) and included flakes, bone fragments, and burned caliche. Cultural
materials recovered within a 15-m area around Feature 41 included 11 flakes (one utilized), one
piece of angular debitage, one tested pebble, one hammerstone, four metate fragments, three
mano fragments, one indeterminate groundstone, and one worked El Paso brownware ceramic. A
sample of fill was collected from Feature 88, which provided a date associated with the early
portion of the Mesilla phase of the Formative period (Beta No. 270232, 1640 ± 40 B.P., charred
material; δ13C = -24.7), cal A.D. 330 to 540, calibrated at 2-Sigma; see Appendix C).
Excavation Block 15 was a 1-m by 2-m unit located alongside the eastern margin of BHT 12 to
excavate a basin depression of dark brown sand (Feature 90) that was identified in the east wall of
the trench. Surface eolian sands were removed mechanically (BHS 6) to facilitate excavation.
Excavation below the mechanically scraped surface consisted of a single natural level (Level 2, 9­
16 cm in depth) that removed the remaining eolian sands to compact brown sandy loam
sediments. Two small pits (Feature 90.1 and Feature 90.2) located just north of Feature 90 were
identified. No cultural materials were found in the three features. Excavation of Feature 90,
Feature 90.1, and Feature 90.2 revealed that they were the remains of a recent humic lens.
Summary
Site 41EP970 (FB 7520) is an extremely large, multicomponent, prehistoric camp that was
utilized from the Late Paleo-Indian period through the Formative period. Although the datum
from the 1990 site assessment (Mauldin et al. 1998) was not relocated, the original datum
location was projected from the position of grid stakes and was re-established. One hundred
percent of the surface artifacts were collected in 1990 and again during the current project. Ten
block areas were manually excavated during the current investigation, excavating all or portions
of 39 features and 215.3-square meters of the site, and moving approximately 30.767-cubic
meters of fill. Mechanical excavations consisted of 12 backhoe trenches and six backhoe scrapes,
which excavated 463.47-square meters of the site moving 210.45-cubic meters of fill.
Geomorphic investigations at the site included examination of the pedogenic and stratigraphic
profile and drawing of the stratigraphic profile of the trench walls.
The number of artifacts on the surface of the site varied dramatically across the site, with the
highest densities in the northwestern and southern portions of the site. Outside of these areas, a
few pockets of materials were found, but overall artifacts were randomly dispersed across the site.
The overall density of artifacts on the surface was low at 0.015 items per square meter, or one
artifact for every 67.26-square meters. Artifacts collected from the site included 113 ceramics,
484 lithic artifacts, and 241 groundstone. Projectile points recovered from this site include Late
Paleo-Indian period, Middle Archaic period, Late Archaic period dart points and one Formative
period arrow point. All but two of the ceramics recovered from the site were El Paso brownware
and indicate portions of the site date to the Formative period. The remaining two ceramics were
unidentified corrugated wares that likely date into the latter portion of the Formative period.
Fieldwork at 41EP970 (FB 7520) was designed to identify areas of cultural remains that could
provide significant data regarding the prehistory of the region. The cultural material remains
identified on the site were similar to what was reported in 1990 during Fort Bliss Project 90-11
(Mauldin et al. 1998). Features that appeared to contain the highest level of integrity and were in
the best proximity to surface items were selected for excavation.
Backhoe trenches excavated on the sites did reveal that intact historic age sediments are present
but rare, and are generally restricted to dunes scattered throughout the site. Interdune areas are
heavily deflated as identified by the condition of most thermal features on the site. Based on the
amount of sampling performed on features on this site, no further work is recommended at

41EP970 (FB 7520). It is recommended that the investigations performed at this site have been
sufficient to mitigate any adverse effects to this site as defined in 36 CFR 800.
41EP5714 (FB 12284)
Previous Investigations
Site 41EP5714 (FB 12284) was first identified during a survey conducted in 1990 by the Fort
Bliss Directorate of Environment (Mauldin et al. 1998:211, 214; Fort Bliss Project 90-11). Field
notes prepared during this project indicate the site consisted of a 1-m diameter concentration of
25 pieces of burned caliche and five pieces of fire-cracked rock with charcoal stained sediments.
Two pieces of fire-cracked rock were also recorded roughly 15-m to the north of this feature.
The site was later reevaluated by Lone Mountain Archaeological Services, Inc., (Church and
Stowe 2006) and described as a small campsite that included one thermal feature, a tested
obsidian cobble, a flaked stone tool, and a metate fragment within a 45-m by 40-m area (Church
and Stowe 2006:I-518 to I-521). The thermal feature was recorded as a concentration of 77
pieces of burned caliche and fire-cracked rock in a 2-m by 4-m area with a 50-cm diameter
charcoal stain that extended 7-cm deep.
Current Investigations
From September to October 2009, GMI archaeologists conducted data recovery excavations at
41EP5714 (FB 12284), a small prehistoric camp consisting of a sparse artifact scatter and a single
feature. The area of the site defined by the GIS shape file is 1,072-square meters, extending 46-m
east to west by 42-m wide north to south, at an elevation of 1,219 m (4,000 ft) amsl (Figure 6.35).
The site is located west of a broad, north to south trending ridge on the desert floor (see Appendix
A). During the current investigation, no additional cultural material was found outside the
previously documented site boundary and the site size was retained. The previously established
datum was no longer present and a new datum was established in the southern portion of the site,
near Feature 1.
In addition to reestablishing the site boundary, 100 percent of the surface artifacts (n = 8) were
collected. Approximately 1-square meter of the site was manually excavated, since only the
single feature on the site was excavated. In addition, 6.8-square meters of the site were backhoe
trenched. The manual excavation was placed over the site feature and the backhoe trench was
placed in an area with good integrity in the south portion of the site. The backhoe trench was
placed in an area that was likely to provide an accurate characterization of the subsurface
sediments and the geomorphic context of the site. The provenience of the collected surface
artifacts, feature, excavation block, and backhoe trench were documented using a sub-meter
accuracy GPS (see Figure 6.35).
Environmental Setting
Site 41EP5714 (FB 12284) is located within two interconnected interdune areas between large 1­
m to 2.5-m high coppice dunes that are stabilized by mesquite and four-wing saltbush.
Vegetation in the site area consists of mesquite, four-wing saltbush, soaptree yucca, broom
snakeweed, and some perennials, in decreasing order of frequency. This flora is categorized as a
basin desert shrub land – coppice (Space Imaging/Geoeye 2000, IKONOS data). Surface
visibility in the site area ranges from 70 to 80 percent. Recent eolian sands (coppice dunes) cover
17 percent (180-square meters) and flora covers an additional 10 percent of the site surfaces.

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

Tracked and other vehicle impacts have impacted 30 percent of the site surface. Erosion in
interdunal areas ranges from minimal to moderate. Interdunal areas that have experienced
erosion are estimated to be 40 cm to as much as 60 cm below historic surfaces, as identified from
the trench profile and exposures against stabilized dune sheets within the site. The feature has
been eroded and dispersed.
The surface sediments consist of recently deposited, light brown sand and some brown sandy
loam with a few surface gravel and pebble sized inclusions. The site area falls within the
McNew-Copia-Foxtrot Complex (Natural Resource Conservation Service 2004). An agricultural
soil survey of El Paso County identified all soils in the area as part of the Hueco Wink
Association (Jaco 1971:24, Sheet 43).
The site is located within the La Mesa geomorphic surface within Mapping Unit 2a as described
by Monger (1993). Mapping Unit 2a are described as large dunes generally larger than one meter
in height with interdune sheet deposits (Monger 1993:37).
Surface Collection
The surface artifact assemblage consisted of eight artifacts. During the current mitigation project,
100 percent of the site artifacts were collected and analyzed. These items are listed below in
Table 6.11. The mano fragments were associated with Feature 1 and the remaining artifacts were
scattered within the site area (see Figure 6.35).

Mechanical Excavation
One backhoe trench (Backhoe Trench 1 [BHT 1]) was excavated on the site. This trench was
placed in the southeastern portion of the site (Figure 6.36). The trench was 9.05-m in length by
0.75-m wide (6.79-square meters), extended to a maximum of 1.45-m deep; 9.84-cubic meters of
fill was removed. BHT 1 contained up to a 41 cm of recent eolian sand (Q4) over a 40-cm thick
Q3Ab that overlaid 24 cm of Q3Bk1, and more than 19 cm of a Q3Bk2 strata (Figure 6.37). The
deep Q3 sediments found in this trench may suggest that buried cultural material may be present
in the site area, although no cultural materials were found in the trench.
Manual Excavations
A single 2-m by 2-m excavation unit was established over Feature 1. The unit was located on top
of a deflated surface that had been deflated through Q3 sediments onto a hardpan surface.
Therefore, excavations were limited to recovering the burned caliche and fire-cracked rock from
the surface, bisecting the remaining charcoal stain fill of this deflated feature, and collecting all
fill.

Features
Feature 1 on the site surface consisted of a 3.6-m by 2.25-m scatter of burned caliche and firecracked rocks with a circular in plan and a 70 cm by 66 cm, light gray charcoal stain. Excavation
revealed the feature to be basin in profile and 7-cm deep (Figure 6.38). Eighty-five fire-cracked
rocks/burned caliche were recorded with the feature (7.04 kg). Two of the fire-cracked rocks
were sandstone mano fragments from the same mano. All charcoal-stained fill of the feature was
collected as a float sample. A sample of fill was collected from Feature 1 provided a date
associated with the Mesilla phase of the Formative period (Beta No. 270234, 1190 ± 40 B.P.,
charred material; δ13C = -24.6, cal A.D. 710 to 750, A.D. 760 to 900, and A.D. 920 to 960,

Summary
Site 41EP5714 (FB 12284) is a small prehistoric camp that was utilized during the latter portion
of the Mesilla phase of the Formative period. During the current investigations, the site size
(1,072-square meters) was maintained as originally recorded during Fort Bliss Project 01-11
(Church and Stowe 2006). The site datum from a subsequent site assessment (Church and Stowe
2006; Fort Bliss Project 01-11) was not relocated, and a new site datum was established during
the current project near Feature 1. One block excavation area was manually excavated during the
current investigation, excavating the single feature and moving 0.25-cubic meters of fill.
Mechanical excavations consisted of one backhoe trench that excavated 6.79-square meters of the
site and moved 9.84-cubic meters of fill. The mechanical excavation lacked subsurface cultural
material; given the overall deflated condition of the single feature found on the site and the
interdune surfaces, intact cultural evidence is unlikely. Geomorphic investigations at the site
included examination of the pedogenic and stratigraphic profile and drawing of the stratigraphic
profile of the trench walls.
The few artifacts found on the surface of the site were generally widely spaced; only two mano
fragments were found associated with Feature 1. The overall density of artifacts on the surface
was extremely low at 0.0075 items per square meter, or one artifact for every 134-square meters.
One-hundred percent of the surface artifacts were collected and included five lithic artifacts and
three groundstone. Feature 1 was radiocarbon dated and is associated with the latter part of the
Mesilla phase of the Formative period.

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

Although the single backhoe trench excavated on the site did reveal that deep Q3 sediments are
present, no intact associated prehistoric occupation surface associated with the feature were
identified. Most of the site surface is deflated and the interdune areas are extensively deflated.
The site did not contain statistically viable samples of materials, although the few items present
are likely associated with the single occupation represented by the feature. Based on the amount
of excavations performed on this site, and the small size and deflated condition of the site, no
further work is recommended at 41EP5714 (FB 12284). It is recommended that the
investigations performed at this site have been sufficient to mitigate any adverse effects to this
site as defined in 36 CFR 800.
41EP6301 (FB 12245)
Previous Investigations
Site 41EP6301 (FB 12245) was first identified in 1990 as a large (12,382-square meter)
prehistoric campsite that contained a scatter of artifacts and three thermal features (Mauldin et al.
1998:348-350; Fort Bliss Project 90-11). Twelve-square meters was excavated and one feature
was tested. Only the basal elements of the charcoal stain hearth feature remained and did not
provide enough charcoal to radiocarbon date. Obsidian hydration was performed on one
specimen and resulted in a date of A.D. 1253 SD 43 (Stevenson 1998:469). The site was 100
percent surface collected, resulting in the collection of 73 surface items. The surface items
included two pieces of angular debitage, 56 flakes (eight were utilized), one marginally retouched
tool, one unifacially shaped tool, five cores, one complete mano, two metate fragments and five
indeterminate groundstone fragments. Thirty-eight subsurface items were recovered within a
block excavation over Feature 1 and included 33 flakes, two pieces of angular debitage, one mano
fragment, and two indeterminate groundstone fragments. The report stated that the site was
initially assessed as severely deflated, though this was inaccurate (Mauldin et al. 1998:350).
However, a review of the original notes identified large areas of the site that were deflated down
to hardpan and large portions that had been mechanically altered.
Current Investigations
From September through November of 2009, GMI archaeologists conducted data recovery
excavations at 41EP6301 (FB 12245). The area of the site defined by the GIS shape file is 274 m
north to south by 150 m east to west (15,633-square meters), at an elevation of 1,222 m (4,010 ft)
amsl (Figure 6.39). The site is located west edge of a broad playa on the desert floor, in the
central portion of the Hueco Bolson (see Appendix A). Site 41EP6301 (FB 12245) is a large
prehistoric camp. During the current investigation, one cultural item was found just outside the
previously documented site boundary and the site boundary was increased. The previously
established datum was no longer present. A new datum was established in the southern portion of
the site, in the approximate location of the original datum.
In addition to reestablishing the site boundary, 100 percent of the surface artifacts (n = 100) were
collected and plotted with a GPS. Less than 1-square meter of the site was manually excavated in
a single excavation block and 19.17-square meters of the site were backhoe trenched. The
manual excavation block was placed over the only feature on the site that retained some integrity
(Feature 4). The backhoe trenches were placed in areas that were likely to provide an accurate
characterization of the subsurface sediments and the geomorphic context of the site and near
Feature 4. The provenience of collected surface artifacts, features, the excavation block, and
backhoe trenches were documented using a sub-meter accuracy GPS.

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

Environmental Setting
Site 41EP6301 (FB 12245) is located within a large area (180,247-square meter) that had been
bulldozed during the Cold War era. The site area contained at least two hull down areas, and
several caliche pads constructed for bivouac locations were found just outside the site boundary.
The entire site area is deflated and only the basal elements of one feature were identified during
the current project. The site is located 595 m west of a major fault line playa.
Vegetation in the site area consists mainly of dropseed grasses with various sandburs including:
Cenchrus incertus, Cenchrus longispinus, and Centrus spinifex. Additionally, goat head
(Tribulus terrestris), Russian thistle, broom snakeweed, four-wing saltbush and small mesquite
were noted in the site area. This flora is categorized as a basin desert shrub land – coppice
(Space Imaging/Geoeye 2000, IKONOS data). Surface visibility in the site area ranged from 90
to 95 percent. Recent eolian sands (coppice dunes) cover 5 percent of the site surface and flora
covers an additional 5 percent. Tracked and other vehicles have impacted 100 percent of the site
surface. Severe surface erosion, disturbance, and displacement have impacted the site, including
removal of the Q4 and Q3 stratum in most areas of the site.
The surface sediments consist of very thin (less than 2 cm), patchy accumulations of recently
deposited, light brown sand over a very compact exposed surface containing Stage II carbonate
nodules and Q1 soils (near the road bed). The site area falls within the McNew-Copia-Foxtrot
Complex (Natural Resource Conservation Service 2004). An agricultural soil survey of El Paso
County identified all soils in the area as part of the Hueco Wink Association (Jaco 1971:24, Sheet
43). The site is located within the La Mesa geomorphic surface within Mapping Unit 2a as
described by Monger (1993). Mapping Unit 2a is described as large dunes, generally larger than
1 m in height, with interdunal sheet deposits (Monger 1993:37).
Surface and Subsurface Collection
The surface artifact assemblage consisted of flakes, marginally retouched tools, cores, mano and
metate fragments, and indeterminate groundstone fragments. During the current mitigation
project, 100 percent of the artifacts located on the site surface were collected. These items are
listed below in Table 6.12. Detailed analysis of the lithic artifact attributes was not conducted
during the current project given the lack of horizontal and vertical integrity of the artifacts. A
butterscotch colored chert drill (Figure 6.40) was collected on 41EP6301 (FB 12245). The drill
measured 5.7 cm in length, 2.08 cm in width, and had a thickness of 0.59 cm.

Figure 6.40. Butterscotch chert drill (CN 118) collected from 41EP6301 (FB 12245).
A total of 73 artifacts (see Table 6.12) was recovered from the site surface during the previous
site investigation (Mauldin et al. 1998; Fort Bliss Project 90-11). Thirty-eight artifacts were also
recovered subsurface during the previous project from Block Excavation 1 that was placed over
Feature 1. These items consisted of 33 flakes, two pieces of angular debitage, 1 mano fragment,
and two indeterminate groundstone fragments.
Features
Feature 4 was located in the north central portion of the site, just west of a heavily impacted hull
down area. The sediment surrounding the feature was not excavated given that the charcoal stain
remains of the feature were on top of hardpan sediments. Excavation revealed only the basal
remains of hearth were present and the majority of this fill was the leached remains of the hearth
(Figure 6.41). Feature 4 was 52-cm by 47-cm in size and 5-cm deep, and was circular in plan
basin shaped. No cultural materials were present within the feature fill and although a float
sample was collected, it provided only 0.1 grams of charcoal and was not submitted for
radiocarbon dating.

Backhoe Trench 1 (BHT 1) was located on a high dune sandy area that contained some surface
cultural materials and caliche nodules. This trench was excavated in order to determine if
subsurface cultural bearing deposits were present in this area. The excavation revealed
homogeneous brown sandy loam sediment throughout the 1.5-m vertical extent of BHT 1 (Figure
6.43). These deposits are a recent mixture of Q3 sediments that were likely excavated re­
deposited by machinery during the construction of the hull down near this area. The lack of
developed sediments within BHT 1 indicates that the sediments in the site area have been
mechanically mixed and re-deposited.
Backhoe Trench 2 (BHT 2) was located in the central portion of the site, just west of Feature 4.
This trench was excavated near Feature 4, a charcoal stain hearth, to determine whether
subsurface deposits were present. The trench revealed 10 cm of recently deposited eolian sands
(Q4) over a 30-cm thick Q3Bk1 horizon that overlaid a caliche laden Q1 deposit (Figure 6.44).
The upper sediments were repositioned and altered. Nearby Feature 4 was found within the lower
deposits of the Q3Bk1 deposits. No cultural materials were found within BHT 2.
Backhoe Trench 3 (BHT 3) was located in the northern portion of the site within a large dune
field. The trench is described in detail in Appendix B (see Appendix B). Two Q4 sediments
were identified near the top of this trench, indicating recent eolian sand deposits. The upper,
unconsolidated Q4 sand was 18-cm thick, and overlaid semi-compact Q4 sediment that was 23­
cm thick (Figures 6.45 and 6.46). This deposit overlaid 15-cm thick Q3Ab sediment, which was
over compact, 19-cm thick Q3Bk sediment over caliche (Q1). No cultural evidence was present
in this trench. Although Q3 sediments are present in this trench, they are thin and near the basal
elements of Holocene age sediments, and likely predate human occupation of the region.
Mechanical excavations on 41EP6301 (FB 12245) were limited to the three backhoe trenches.
Excavation of these trenches verified that the site was situated within terrain that had been
mechanically altered and that the integrity of the site had been severely impacted. These trenches
all contained sediments that were mixed and had been mechanically removed down to Q3
sediments that likely predated human occupation in the area. Therefore, the site area was not
mechanically scraped. The single feature with intact remains identified during the current project
(Feature 4) represented the deflated basal elements of a hearth

Manual Excavation
Previous excavations in 1990 (Mauldin et al. 1998; Fort Bliss Project 90-11) focused on Feature
1, a charcoal stain hearth, located in the south central portion of the site. One block, Excavation
Block 1, was placed over a surface scatter of 30 pieces of burned caliche and fire-cracked rock
that comprised Feature 1. Excavation Block 1 extended over a 6-m by 3-m (12-square meter)

Chapter 6. Results of Archaeological Data Recovery Investigations

area and was excavated in 1-m by 1-m units. The block was excavated in a single natural level in
the eight western-most 1-m by 1-m units. The remaining four units were excavated in an
arbitrary level. Feature 1 was identified as a basin shaped hearth that was circular in plan. The
feature extended over a 40-cm by 35-cm area and was 5-cm deep. Cultural materials recovered
from the surface of Excavation Block 1 in association with Feature 1 included one flake, one firecracked rock, and 35 pieces of burned caliche.
During the current project, manual excavations on this site focused on Feature 4, a small charcoal
stain hearth, located in the north central portion of the site. A 2-m by 2-m excavation unit
(Excavation Block 2) was established over this feature (Figure 6.47). Excavation was limited to
bisecting and then excavating the remaining fill of Feature 4. All fill was collected, no artifacts
were found. No excavation was conducted outside this feature since the feature was on top of
hardpan sediments.

Summary
Site 41EP6301 (FB 12245) is a large prehistoric camp that remains unassigned temporally given
the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts or absolute chronometric material. During the current
investigations, the site size was generally similar to what was originally recorded during Fort
Bliss Project 90-11 (Mauldin et al. 1998), and encompassed 15,633-square meters. The original
site datum was not located; a new datum was established at roughly the original datum location,
as identified from aerial photographs. One-hundred percent of the surface artifacts were collected
during both the previous and current site assessments.
One block excavation area was manually excavated previously and one was excavated over a
newly discovered feature during the current project. The manual excavations on this site
excavated 12.19-square meters (2.1-cubic meters of fill) during both investigations. Mechanical
excavations were performed only during the current project and consisted of three backhoe
trenches that excavated 19.17-square meters (21.93-cubic meters of fill). No subsurface cultural
evidence was found during the mechanical excavations; excavation of the trenches verified that
6-63

the entire site area had been mechanically altered and the coppice dunes removed to facilitate
military training, likely during the 1950s to 1960s. Geomorphic investigations at the site included
examination of the pedogenic and stratigraphic profile and drawing of the stratigraphic profile of
the trench walls.
The artifacts on the surface of the site were generally exposed by deflation on the ridges of hull
downs. The overall density of artifacts on the surface of 41EP6301 (FB 12245) was low at
0.0111 items per square meter, or one artifact for every 90.36 square meters. Artifacts collected
from the site during both site assessments included 176 lithic artifacts and 35 groundstone, no
ceramic artifacts were found. The site is temporally unassigned since no diagnostic artifacts were
found and the site and features were too deflated to provide adequate samples for radiocarbon
dating.
The three backhoe trenches excavated on the site revealed very shallow Q3 sediments just above
caliche deposits, indicating the site area likely does not contain any intact prehistoric surfaces or
cultural bearing sediments. Features on this site were either entirely deflated and/or dispersed or
were only the basal remains of features. Previous mechanical disturbances have severely
impacted the cultural material and feature remains on the site to such a degree that the site’s
integrity had been completely compromised. Based on this lack of integrity, and the amount of
excavations and investigations performed on this site, no further work is recommended at
41EP6301 (FB 12245). It is recommended that the investigations performed at this site have been
sufficient to mitigate any adverse effects to this site as defined in 36 CFR 800.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSES
Tim Graves, Moira Ernst, and Amanda Hoiness
This chapter provides the results of several comparative studies from the results of the
investigations presented in Chapter 6. These include ceramic, chipped stone, groundstone, flora
macrobotanical analysis, and faunal studies. Using data compiled during these investigations, an
attempt was made to determine site function using spatial analyses and what was known of the
structure of the three sites and the site formation processes that they have undergone. This
research domain is explained in detail in Chapter 4. This chapter starts with a review of the
chronological placement of the sites. This is followed by the analyses and comparative studies of
the cultural features and then the artifacts. These studies begin with the comparison of features
and their morphological characteristics by time period. The artifact analyses starts with a study of
the ceramic analyses, followed by a study of the chipped stone and groundstone artifacts. It is in
this final section that inferences on site function are presented. A summary of the subsistence
information derived directly from flora and faunal analyses and indirectly from the artifacts and
burned rock found at the sites. Finally, information on mobility and territorial ranges is offered
based on the data recovered from the sites.
The assemblage at 41EP5714 (FB 12284) did not comprise a statistically valid sample size (n =
8) and detailed analysis of the assemblage on 41EP6301 (FB 12245) was not conducted because
the items were not considered to have horizontal or vertical integrity, so 41EP970 (FB 7520) was
the focus of these analyses.
CHRONOLOGY
The chronological context for the three sites investigated during this project is the fundamental
basis for subsequent analyses and interpretations. The following discussion presents the
assessment of the chronometric information assembled for the sites. It assesses the radiometric
dates obtained by GMI and during previous studies. Relative chronological indicators such as
ceramics and projectile points are also used to evaluate the chronological placement of sites and
features. Generally, this information indicates that the sites have multiple components ranging
from the Paleo-Indian through the Formative period.
Sixteen radiocarbon dates were obtained from two sites (Table 7.1). A radiocarbon date of A.D.
710 to 960 was obtained from the single hearth feature (Feature 1) at 41EP5714 (FB 12284). No
diagnostic artifacts were present on this site and the site will not be discussed further.
Fifteen of the dates were obtained from 41EP970 (FB 7520), including a date obtained during
Fort Bliss Project 90-11 (Mauldin et al. 1998). The dates are graphed in Figure 7.1 and include
the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods as well as the Mesilla phase of the Formative period.

Early Archaic age estimates are rare from the central basins (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Diagnostic artifacts from 41EP970 (FB 7520) include seven projectile points and El Paso
brownware and unidentified corrugated ceramics.
The dated features from 41EP970 (FB 7520) included: two roasting pits (Features 2 and 73); two
pithouse floor hearths (Feature 74.6 and Feature 92.1); the fill within one pithouse (Feature 70);
and several hearth features. Feature 2, which was a large, deep roasting pit, was dated to the
Early Archaic period and Feature 73, the second roasting pit, was dated to the Middle Archaic
period. Eight of the hearths (Features 51, 72, 80, 81.1, 81.3, 81.4, and 83) and two pithouse floor
hearths (Features 74.6 and 92.1) date to the Late Archaic period. Finally, two hearths (Features
44 and 88) and a shallow pithouse (Feature 70) were dated to the Mesilla phase.
Seven projectile points from 41EP970 (FB 7520) could be typed based on their general
morphological characteristics. The projectile points were typed utilizing multiple references that
included Carmichael (1986), Irwin-Williams (1973), Justice (2002), MacNeish (1993b, 1998),
O’Hara (1988), and Turner and Hester (1999). The oldest was a midsection fragment of a
lanceolate projectile point. This point (CN 353) was recovered from the northwest portion of the
site. Its width, and the fact that the piece had parallel flake scars from the margins to the central
portion, indicates a likely Plano cluster affiliation. Plainview points have dates ranging over a
long period (8289 to 4280 B.C.), but most of the associated radiocarbon dates are older than 7000
B.C. (Justice 2002:83). A Bajada-type projectile point (CN 380) was recovered just to the south
of Feature 2, which was radiocarbon dated to the Early Archaic period. The age of Bajada points
has been placed from 6000 to 3300 B.C. (Justice 2002:123) and matches the radiocarbon age
estimate for Feature 2, verifying the presence of a rare Early Archaic component at the site.
Two San Jose-type points, one from the west portion (CN 2) and one in the far northwest portion
(CN 561) were also recovered from the site. San Jose projectile points generally date from
4500/3500 to ca. 1500 B.C. (Justice 2002:133). A San Pedro projectile point (CN 794)
manufactured of obsidian was recovered from Feature 74 and corresponds with the Late Archaic
radiocarbon date from this pithouse. San Pedro-type projectile points have a temporal range from
1500/1000 B.C. to A.D. 300 (Justice 2002:202); this point also matches the small San Pedro-type
defined by Carmichael (1986:94).

Another projectile point, which was recovered from the surface of Feature 45, was identified as a
Guadalupe type (CN 544). Guadalupe-type points fall within the Livermore cluster as defined by
Justice and date from A.D. 100 to 800 and in some instances as late as A.D. 1000 to 1200 (Justice
2002:231). The final, identifiable projectile point was typed as Formative-style (CN 128). It was
manufactured of obsidian and recovered from the far southern area of the site. The projectile
point has some similarities with the Border Star I as defined by O’Hara (1988:319) and the
Guadalupe variant of the Livermore cluster as defined by Justice (2002:233). O’Hara (1988)
states that the point is likely dates to the Late Archaic, but Justice (2002) puts it as Late Archaic
into Formative period.

7-3

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

Another projectile point (CN 560) was recovered within 3 m of one of the San Jose points (CN
561). It had been heavily reworked, although, it has some similarities to the Uvalde type, which
have been dated to the Early Archaic period (O’Hara 1988:296, 309). The point is complete and
was reworked along one lateral margin. The base is slightly concave, the reworked lateral side is
convex, and this stemmed point is deeply corner notched on one side.
The majority of ceramics recovered from 41EP970 (FB 7520) were El Paso brownware, most of
which were clustered near features that were radiocarbon dated to the Mesilla phase. El Paso
brownware is associated with the entire Formative period (A.D. 200/400 to 1450), but given the
dated features on the site, the sherds likely represent Mesilla phase occupations (A.D. 200/400 to
1000). A few unidentified corrugated wares were also recovered near the eastern margin of the
site. These sherds are likely a form of Casas Grandes plain wares, which have been dated to A.D.
800 to 1450 (Van Pool 2003:75).
Several issues become apparent with the assessment of the chronological periods represented at
41EP970 (FB 7520). First, this site has multiple components and the components are spaced
apart, although, some mixing of items undoubtedly occurred. Based on these investigations, the
site contains components ranging from the Early Archaic period through Formative period, with
the majority of occupations dating to the Late Archaic. Light scatters of El Paso brownware
ceramics were observed in proximity to features dated to the Mesilla phase and projectile points
of certain dated types were found in proximity to features with radiocarbon age estimates of
corresponding age. Second, this site is rare, as few sites with components from the Early Archaic
or Middle Archaic periods have been recorded in the Jornada. Finally, several hearths in Block 8
in the southern part of the site appeared to be situated in stratified sediments. However,
radiocarbon dates from these features fell within the early part of the Late Archaic period and
statistical contemporaneity tests did not identify statistical separation or partition among any two
dates, and thus no clusters of age estimates could be identified, indicating that the series of Late
Archaic dates were generally contemporaneous.
SUBSISTENCE
The interpretation of subsistence at 41EP970 (FB 7520) utilized the cultural material remains,
macrobotanical samples, and faunal remains found at the site. A review of these data can provide
a picture of what activities occurred during different periods in the past. Unfortunately, the floral
remains were extremely limited; faunal material from the site was also limited, although, the
sample was more robust than the floral materials.
Faunal Remains
A total of 49 animal bones was recovered from 41EP970 (FB 7520). The bone specimens were
analyzed using Olsen (1964) for comparison. The pertinent variables recorded during
examination included taxon, element, fragmentation, burning, and calcination. Efforts were also
made to determine if butchering marks could be identified. No microscopes or other tools were
used during analysis of the assemblage because attributes requiring magnification could not be
monitored due to the fragmentary and eroded surfaces of the specimens. The entire assemblage
was highly fragmented resulting in a lack of taxonomic and element classifications; nearly all of
the pieces were small fragments that could only be identified as small-to-medium sized mammals.
Of the 49 bone specimens, three were recovered from Block 2, 17 from Block 6, 21 from Block 8,
two from Block 9, and 8 from Block 14. Twenty-two (45 percent) were found in association with
features (Features 41, 74, and 81). All of the specimens from Block 6 were associated with
Feature 74, one of only two fully excavated pithouses at the site. This assemblage is comprised

7-4

Chapter 7. Comparative Analyses

of 15 indeterminate long bones (three calcined and 12 burned), one calcined proximal ulna of the
order Rodentia, and one burned proximal tibia of the Sylvilagus sp.
Of the 21 bones recovered from Block 8, only one, a calcined, indeterminate long bone fragment,
was associated with Feature 41. Four of the eight bones from Block 14, including an unburned
distal humerus fragment of the Sylvilagus sp. and three burned, indeterminate long bone
fragments, were associated with Feature 81.
The remaining 27 bone specimens include: 11 long bone fragments (seven burned, three calcined,
and one unburned); one burned rib fragment; one unburned, distal tibia of the order Rodentia; and
14 indeterminate fragments (two burned, three calcined, and nine unburned).
The dearth of burned bones in association with the excavated features suggests that during the
Middle and Late Archaic periods, hunting may not have been an activity associated with these
occupations. It may also be that the faunal remains associated with hunting during these time
periods were entirely processed and no remains were left. Another possibility is that there is a
general lack of faunal remains due to processing at the kill site. Although, the recovery of burned
fragments associated with Features 74 and 81, which have been radiocarbon dated to the Late
Archaic period, indicates that there was some processing of area fauna during this occupation of
the site.
Macrobotanical Remains
Light fractions and burned charcoal recovered from 41EP970 (FB 7520) were examined by Phil
Dering of Shumla Archeobotanical Services (see Appendix D). Flotation light fractions were
submitted from Features 74.6, 79, 81.3, and 81.5. No charred seeds or plants remains were
present in the samples. An unknown conifer wood was identified during previous analysis of the
light fraction from Feature 2, but the wood specimens were too small to identify to the level of
genus. Mesquite (Prosopis sp.) and four wing saltbush (Atriplex sp.) were the dominant wood
remains from the Late Archaic period and Mesilla phase samples.
MORPHOLOGY OF HOUSE STRUCTURES
Feature types and morphological characteristics have been presented by some researchers as
specific indicators related to function (Graves and Ernst 2007; Graves et al. 2009; Mauldin et al.
1998; Miller 1996; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Researchers have also noted that functional
variation related to morphological characteristics can be a temporal indicator (Graves et al. 2009;
Katz 1992; Lowry 2005; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The following section investigates the
patterns identified in the structures at 41EP970 (FB 7520).
Two structures (Feature 74 and Feature 92) on the site were radiocarbon dated to the Late Archaic
period; both features were oval shaped in plan. Data on the floor areas has been obtained from 36
of 38 structures dating to the Late Archaic. The average floor area of these structures is 4.47­
square meters with a range from 2.01 to 11.04 square meters. The floor areas of the two Late
Archaic houses at 41EP970 were 4.60-square meters for Feature 74 and 2.56-square meters for
Feature 92, both of which fall within the range of Late Archaic house sizes.
Only one structure excavated on the site (Feature 70) was dated to the Mesilla phase. Data
concerning this structure was limited by the fact that during backhoe trenching, the eastern half,
which was under a coppice dune, was removed. However, the western half provided information
regarding morphology and internal features. Feature 70 was a circular, basin-shaped “hut” that
lacked internal and external features. It measured 3.3 m in length and had an estimated 7.79­
square meters of floor area. The floor was an unprepared earthen floor and it lacked cultural
materials. Feature 70 was somewhat atypical of Mesilla phase structures in that it lacked floor
features and it was slightly larger than average for houses in the central basin.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS FOR 41EP970 (FB 7520)
A total of 1,301 artifacts was recovered from surface and subsurface contexts from the three sites
during this project (Fort Bliss 09-20) and during Fort Bliss Project 90-11. This count includes
chipped stone (n = 859), groundstone (n = 328), and ceramic artifacts (n = 116). However, the
assemblage at 41EP5714 (FB 12284) did not comprise a statistically valid sample size (n = 8) and
detailed analysis of the assemblage on 41EP6301 (FB 12245) was not conducted because the
items were not considered to have horizontal or vertical integrity, so 41EP970 (FB 7520) was the
focus of these analyses.
Ceramics
A total of 116 ceramic sherds was recovered from 41EP970 (FB 7520). This total includes 58
sherds recovered during Fort Bliss Project 90-11 (Mauldin et al. 1998) and another 58 sherds
collected during the current project. Two of the sherds were identified as Casas Grandes
corrugated ware and the other 114 sherds are El Paso brownware.
The majority of identifiable vessel forms were jars. However, the largest sherd was a portion of a
“scoop” reconstructed from three fragments near Feature 70. Ceramic “scoops” ladles have been
identified at other Mesilla phase pithouse occupations and have been interpreted as a tool to help
remove sediments during the construction of house structures and pits (Graves et al. 1994).
Groundstone
Three-hundred forty eight groundstone artifacts were recovered from 41EP970 (FB 7520) and,
with the exception of a single mano, all of the items were fragmentary (Table 7.2). Many of the
fragments were found in thermal features and had been recycled as cookstones. Metate fragments
were the most common form, followed, in order of frequency, by fragments of indeterminate
form, mano fragments, and mano/metate fragments.

As is typical of Jornada groundstone assemblages in the central basin, the items from 41EP970
(FB 7520) had been recycled and reworked in several ways (Table 7.4). More than 68 percent of
the items had been recycled as cookstones in thermal features and nearly 18 percent were
recycled for chipped-stone materials. Some items had been shaped and pecked or otherwise used
as battering tools.

Measurements of mano length and grinding surface have been used as proxy indicators of
agricultural dependence (Hard et al. 1996). In Table 7.5, the measurements for the single, whole
mano recovered during these investigations are compared to the length and grinding surface data
presented by Hard et al. (1996). This sole specimen from 41EP970 (FB 7520) falls within the
average length and grinding surface area of Archaic period manos from the Jornada region.
As is typical for Jornada groundstone assemblages, the collection from 41EP970 (FB 7520)
contained very few (n = 1) whole specimens and had been extensively recycled for use as hearth
cookstones and chipped-stone material. The single complete piece conforms to the model of
smaller groundstone implements for earlier time periods as identified by Hard et al. (1996);
although, complete groundstone size may not necessarily be reflective of time period as much as
the intensity of occupation and resource processing in the central basin.

Chipped Stone
In all, 675chipped-stone artifacts were recovered from 41EP970 (FB 7520). Based on the
research issues for this project, the lithic assemblage was the primary focus of analytical
attention. An examination of the composition of the chipped-stone assemblage can provide
insight into what type of activities were conducted at a site, in the project area overall, and during
specific temporal periods. Analysis of the chipped-stone artifacts involved recording the
following attributes: general artifact type, tool type (if applicable), condition, presence of heat
treatment, presence of pigment, raw material type, percent of cortex, dorsal scar pattern, type of
platform, length, thickness, and specific information regarding cores and tool types (if
applicable). Information documented for cores included the number of platforms and the number

7-7

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

of flake scars. Additional information recorded for tools included the number of edges utilized,
morphology of the utilized edge, length of the edge, the type of wear damage, and the angle of the
utilized edge.
The composition of the chipped-stone assemblage is presented in Table 7.6. The assemblage was
dominated by cores and debitage, but an unusually high proportion (19.8 percent) of tools was
also present.

During these analyses, 23 distinct raw material types were identified within the chipped-stone
assemblage (Table 7.7). This includes 13 varieties of chert that account for 29 percent of the
assemblage. Rhyolite and quartzite from the Franklin Mountains are also common, as is
limestone and basalt. Obsidian is also represented in relatively high numbers.

Mauldin et al. (1998) found that the material types most commonly found on the floor of the
central basin were mainly Franklin and Organ Mountain rhyolites, followed by miscellaneous
granular items that likely also originate from these mountains. All were transported into the
region by the ancestral Rio Grande. All of these materials occur on the desert floor within the

central basin and likely represent opportunistic material collection rather than materials brought
into the area. One way to verify this inference is to identify the sizes of the chipped stone versus
the percent of cortex on the pieces. The higher percent of cortex related to the small size will
verify if these items are Rio Grande deposited gravels or materials brought in from the mountain
ranges on either side of the basin. Certain material types that do not occur within the central
basin include Franklin Mountain rhyolite and ignimbrite as well as Llanoria quartzite and basalt
from the Mundy formation. Materials from the Hueco Mountains include the Hueco Mountain
cherts. Mauldin found that although Franklin mountain rhyolites were commonly transported to
sites on the basin floor and reduced for tools, these materials do not outcrop naturally in the basin,
but rather were obtained from alluvial deposits along the flanks of the Franklin Mountains.
It has been inferred that fine-grained raw materials were preferred for processing animal remains
and medium-to-coarse-grained raw materials were preferred for the processing of plant remains.
Jobson (1986:9-20) found that fine-grained raw materials provide sharp edges and sharp edges
have been associated with the processing of faunal remains. Conversely, Foix and Bradley
(1985) demonstrated that fine-grained materials do not retain an edge if they are used for
processing plant remains, but coarse-grained materials retain a specific edge and have almost no
use-wear damage. There is also a body of data indicating that more mobile groups, such as the
people occupying the region during the Middle Archaic, deliberately selected fine-grained
materials that could be quickly shaped into tools that were important for hunting (Miller 2007a;
Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Parry and Kelly 1987).
An examination of the raw material grain size of the chipped-stone artifacts from 41EP970 (FB
7520) revealed that the assemblage is fairly evenly divided between very fine-to-fine grained (47
percent, n = 314) and medium-to-coarse grained (51 percent, n = 343) raw materials (Table 7.8).
These data indicate that both plant and animal remains were processed at the site. This may be a
reflection of the individual components present on the site and the activities carried out by those
occupants (e.g., Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, Mesilla phase), or throughout its occupation, both
activities were performed at the site.

The recorded flake attributes (percent of cortex, platform type, length and thickness) demonstrate
that the assemblage at 41EP970 (FB 7520) reflects the multiple components present and was not
dominated by primary or late-stage reduction and was composed of both locally available and
distant sources of material. The ratios of flakes lacking cortex (53 percent, n = 226) versus those
with cortex (47 percent, n = 202) are fairly even (Table 7.9). Based on the higher percent of
materials without cortex at 41EP970 (FB 7520), which had multiple components spanning from
the late Paleo-Indian period through the late Formative period, the utilization of locally available
Rio Grande deposited gravels tends to decrease through time. These findings are similar to those
found at other sites in the central basin, where medium- to coarse-grained materials from either
side of the basin become more prominent in the assemblages of later time periods starting with

7-9

the Late Archaic period and increasing progressively through the early to late Mesilla phase
(Mauldin et al. 1998).

An examination of flake platform types within the chipped-stone assemblage provides additional
information regarding the activities carried out at the site (Table 7.10). More than one-half (56
percent, n = 240) of the flakes had a single platform and only 5 percent (n = 23) had multifaceted
platforms. Multifaceted platforms are usually associated with biface production rather than core
reduction (Andrefsky 2004:88; Tomka 1989). These data, in conjunction with the high incidence
of noncortical debitage, indicate that intensive reduction and tool maintenance, rather than
bifacial tool production took place at the site.

The flake length and thickness data support the inference that both core reduction and reduction
and tool production/maintenance activities were carried out at the site (Table 7.11). Flake lengths
at 41EP970 (FB 7520) ranged from 0.03 cm to 10.02 cm and flake thickness ranged from 0.49 cm
to 9.26 cm.

Tool edge data can indicate slight functional differences in tool use and functional orientation at
sites; however, these variables were not recorded during Fort Bliss Project 90-11, so only the
tools recovered during the current investigations are included (Table 7.12). Tools from 41EP970
(FB 7520) had a mean edge length of 3.74 cm, indicating more intensive use which, in turn is a
indication of a residential focus. The tools also had a larger average edge angle (62.2 degrees),
and 61 percent (n = 70) had sinuous cutting edges. These data indicate a focus on cutting larger,
heavier items, as tools with smaller edge angles usually also have higher proportions of straight
cutting edges, indicating a focus on cutting smaller, more lightweight items.

CHIPPED STONE TECHNOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION BY TIME PERIOD
Observing that a wide range of occupational components was represented at 41EP970 (FB 7520)
and that the components were, in a general sense, spatially segregated from each other, we
examined whether or not differences in assemblage composition might be detected between Early
or Middle Archaic period components and Late Archaic period and Mesilla phase components.
The chronometric studies and other analyses had identified an Early Archaic component
associated with Feature 2, Late Archaic occupations associated with Features 74 and 90, and
Mesilla phase components at Features 41 and 70.
Feature 2 was examined because it yielded a rare Early Archaic period date. The area subsuming
Features 55, 56, 92 and 92.1 was investigated to study items associated with a residential
structure dating to the early portion of the Late Archaic period (near the Middle/Late Archaic
boundary). Feature 74 was representative of a residential structure associated with the latter
portion of the Late Archaic period. Finally, the area subsuming Features 41, 88, and 91was
selected as representative of the early portion of the Mesilla phase and Feature 70 the latter part
of the Mesilla phase.
The results of this comparative chronological analysis are presented in Table 7.13. It is evident
from this analysis that lower proportions of flake debitage and significantly higher proportions of
tools are present in the two earlier components. These findings accord well with other studies
suggesting greater emphasis on tool production and maintenance at settlements occupied by
mobile hunter-gatherer groups.

These patterns in assemblage composition are mirrored by differences in raw material types and
textures. The higher percentage of fine-grained raw materials associated with the earlier
components – materials that provide sharp edges that have been associated with processing faunal
remains (Jobson 1986) – indicates that the site may have been used for processing local fauna, as
fine-grained materials are far more common on sites used by more mobile populations (Miller
2007; Parry and Kelly 1987). Although few faunal remains that would support this inference
were found, this scarcity may be due to a combination of factors. Faunal remains are generally
found in association with midden features, which Early and Middle Archaic populations did not
produce, or, due to the high mobility of hunters and gatherers of these time periods, manufacture
and/or maintenance of tool kits did not occur in association with the processing of fauna.
However, the results of the analysis of raw materials from different time periods do not
necessarily bear out this conclusion.
POINT-PATTERN SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM 41EP970 (FB 7520)
Using the ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies reviewed in Chapter 4 as guidelines,
spatial analysis and identification of variable forms of site structure at prehistoric Jornada huntergatherer and horticulturalist settlements may be used to make general inferences regarding the
duration of settlement, size of resident social group, and the systemic function and orientation of
the site (i.e., residential forager, residential collector, task-specific collector). Recent analysis of
spatial point pattern distributions at the El Arenal site (Miller 2007b) yielded estimates of site
occupation span that could be integrated into broader analyses of mobility, seasonality, and
technological organization.

7-12

Chapter 7. Comparative Analyses

The fundamental issue involving the robust detection and interpretation of archaeological pointpattern artifact distributions revolves around whether or not such patterns represent random
distributions, or what is termed complete spatial randomness (CSR). Non-random clustered or
more evenly distributed distributions potentially represent patterned cultural behavior. Most
spatial studies work from the assumption of a null (random) distribution based on a Poisson
distribution of grid points (a Poisson distribution is essentially a variation of a normal distribution
that is derived from small sample numbers [after Ord 1972], such as the distribution of counts of
features within recording cells that usually contain only 1 to 3 features per cell). Distributions
that significantly differ from CSR or other forms of random null models are perceived to
represent various levels of non-random clustering that were created through some action or
agency. In the present case, it would be assumed that the non-random patterning was caused by
some cultural or behavioral factor, although geomorphic factors must also be considered.
Identification of these different patterns and scales of behavior can then be linked to higher order
inferences regarding site formation and site structure.
These are several robust methods for detecting the scale or scales at which various classes of data
exhibit spatial segregation or aggregation. The application of these statistical measures to the
point-pattern data from 41EP970 (FB 7520) can determine the distance interval or scales at which
various classes of data exhibit spatial segregation or aggregation across the landscape. Two
analyses were applied to the point pattern data from this site. The first involved an examination
of the entire surface dataset and all major artifact and feature types to identify global patterns of
spatial aggregation and segregation. Hodder and Okell’s A statistic (Hodder and Okell 1978) was
selected for the preliminary data overview because it is a relatively straightforward calculation
and the coefficients are readily interpretable and not overly influenced by edge or boundary
effects.
This procedure provides global intra-type distance measures that effectively serve as distance and
similarity measures that can be incorporated into other statistical procedures. In the present case,
a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis was conducted on the global intra-type distances.
Multidimensional scaling is a method of data reduction that allows for a relatively simple twodimensional or three-dimensional analysis of multivariate distance or similarity measures.
Multidimensional scaling attempts to detect the structure, or meaningful underlying dimensions,
in a set of distance measures between objects or cases. This is accomplished by assigning
observations to specific locations in a conceptual space such that the distances between points in
the space match the given dissimilarities as closely as possible. In many cases, the dimensions of
this conceptual space can be plotted on a graph for further analysis and interpretation. The MDS
dimensional plot of the distance measures obtained from the analysis of Hodder and Okell’s A
statistic is provided in Figure 7.2 below.
The patterns illustrated in Figure 7.2 are generally similar to those identified using the same
spatial procedure at the El Arenal site (Miller 2007b). Formal tools show relatively close spatial
associations and are separated from other artifact classes and features. Hearths, groundstone
fragments, debitage, and cores tend to be spatially aggregated. The association of groundstone
and hearths may be due to the recycling of groundstone as heating stones. House structures,
ceramics, and hearth features lacking rock or burned caliche heating elements are spatially
associated, although the house structures tend to be segregated from other features and artifact
types. A similar pattern was observed at El Arenal. This preliminary analysis and its similarity
to previous findings at the El Arenal site lend confidence that consistent and interpretable spatial
patterning can be recovered from the surface artifact distributions at 41EP970 (FB 7520).

Hodder and Okell’s A statistic.
The next analysis employs more robust tests of spatial randomness or association using Ripley’s
L (the standardized transformation of Ripley’s K function) and the Wiegand-Moloney O-ring
statistic. These are robust methods for detecting the multiple scales at which non-random
clustered or segregated artifact distributions occur and are less subject to boundary and edge
effects. Ripley’s K and L functions are cumulative. That is, they accumulate point densities at
increasingly larger radii and thus larger spatial scales may be somewhat biased by the “memory”
of patterns calculated for smaller scales (Haase 1995; Wiegand and Moloney 2004).
The O-ring statistic avoids these cumulative effects and thus provides a more accurate and
unbiased estimate (provided that sufficient sample numbers of points are available). The O-ring
function offers further advantages in that it measures spatial randomness at each interval r, while
Ripley’s K and L functions only provide a measure of spatial randomness up to a specified
interval (a multiple of r intervals). In this study, the L function was considered to be
complementary to the O-ring statistic. Due to the large areas of blank space surrounding the
main site area, the spatial analysis has been conducted using a heterogeneous Poisson null model,
which searches for statistical clustering within predefined areas of point densities. This approach
defines a homogenous subregion that excludes blank areas, thus increasing the reliability of the
results.
Clustered distributions are clearly visible at 41EP970 (FB 7520). These clusters are inferred to
represent activity areas. The dimensions of these activity areas may be assumed as analogs to
artifact and debris distributions recorded among numerous modern hunter-gatherer ethnographic
studies (Bartram et al. 1991; Binford 1978; Enloe et al. 1994; Hayden and Cannon 1983; Koetje
1994; Murray 1980; O’Connell 1987; O’Connell et al. 1992; Stevenson 1991; Yellen 1996). If
so, it is proposed that the dimensions of these clusters can be compared against the ethnographic
record to estimate group size and length of occupation at 41EP970 (FB 7520) as was done for the
El Arenal site.
All artifact classes are examined to define the global scale or scales at which all artifacts
aggregate or separate across the site area (Figure 7.3). The spatial radius was set at 1-m
increments. The univariate O-ring statistic identifies a strong degree of clustering at r = 1 and
continued significant clustering at scales of r = 2, 3, and 4 m. Artifacts are randomly distributed

7-14

Chapter 7. Comparative Analyses

at scales of 5 to 7 m and are weakly segregated for intervals of 8 to 14 m. The Ripley’s L
function shows that some degree of clustering occurs up to scales of 4 m. Based on these
analyses, a strong level of clustering is present at intervals of between 1 and up to 4 m.
Compared to El Arenal, there is much less structure at 41EP970 (FB 7520) at larger scales. El
Arenal had additional intervals of spatial clustering and dispersion which appear to be absent in
the present case.

(upper right) distribution of O-ring statistic for all artifacts at spatial scales r = 1 m;
(lower right) distribution of Ripley’s L function at spatial scales r = 1 m.
Light lines denote 95% confidence intervals for spatial randomness derived from a
heterogeneous Poisson null model.
Translating these interval (radius) measurements into areas (a = πr2), it is determined that major
non-random artifact clustering occurs within individually bounded areas of 5 to 50 square meters.
These dimensional measures prove important because they can theoretically be related to the
dimensions of debris scatters and hut or house-centered activity areas documented
ethnographically among several contemporary hunter-gatherer groups. The dimensions of such
house and hearth-centered activity areas have been found to correlate with the size of the resident
household group and duration of occupation (Bartram et al. 1991; Kent 1991; O’Connell 1987;
Stevenson 1991; Yellen 1977). The dimensions of activity areas at !Kung San campsites
occupied by small social groups for relatively short periods are significantly smaller than those
occupied for longer periods by larger Alyawara household groups. This pattern tends to hold true
in the broader cross-cultural analysis reported by Kent (1991).
Yellen (1977:103-106) developed several terms to describe debris scatters at !Kung (Dobe San)
camps. Two of the terms have been most commonly used for comparative studies: absolute limit
of scatter (ALS) and limited nuclear area (LNA). The ALS is an objective term describing the
total spatial limit of all artifacts and features at an abandoned settlement. The LNA comprises the
location of a hut or house structure, exterior hearths, and associated artifact scatter. O’Connell

7-15

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

(1987) uses the LNA to compare his data on Alyawara household size and occupational span
against the !Kung; Bartram et al. (1991) adopt the ALS to measure Kua (Basarwa) camps.
As with the El Arenal site, the cluster dimension at 41EP970 (FB 7520) can be compared to the
size dimensions of Dobe San, Kua, and Alyawara household areas. A high degree of non-random
clustering was observed both among debitage and hearths and among all artifacts at scales of up
to 1 to 4 m in radius, or approximately 5- to 50-square meters in area. It can be assumed on
relatively strong grounds that these clusters, consisting of closely associated groups of artifacts
and hearths, are the equivalent of the LNA spatial dimension. Figure 7.4 compares the spatial
dimensions at 41EP970 (FB 7520) and El Arenal against a plot of area and occupation span for
the ethnographic examples of LNA and ALS. Comparing the LNA data for the Dobe San !Kung
and Alyawara, it is evident that the dimensions of occupational clusters at 41EP970 (FB 7520)
fall within the range of Dobe San !Kung settlements occupied for periods ranging from a couple
days to upwards of 30 or 35 days.

Figure 7.4. Relationship between occupation span and dimensions of debris scatters in modern
hunter-gatherer camps compared to estimated LNA at 41EP970 (FB 7520) and El
Arenal (data compiled from Bartram et al. 1991; O’Connell 1987; Yellen 1977).
Based on these comparisons, an estimate of the occupation span for the many of the proveniences
at 41EP970 (FB 7520) would range from a few days to perhaps as much as 30 or 35 days, but
would clearly not meet the expectations for longer-term settlements of more than 50 days
duration, such as was observed at El Arenal. It must be emphasized that these statements are
intended as a model - or heuristic - estimate of occupation duration for several of the prominent
artifact clusters at 41EP970.

SUMMARY
Archaeological investigations at the three sites in Maneuver Area 1B were completed in
accordance with a research plan designed to investigate issues of site structure, site formation,
and inferences of settlement function derived from each. A subset of these studies looked closely
at the use of thermal features to investigate logistical use of the central basin and how that may
have varied through time. Special attention was given to Late Archaic settlement and land use
because significant components associated with this period were present. To accomplish this, a
specific focus on chipped-stone technological organization was adopted.
GMI also looked at the archaeological remains in the project area within a wider regional
perspective, viewing demographic and settlement changes within and among the sites, as they
reflected broader developments in pan-regional social and territorial networks (see McBrinn
2005) from the Paleo-Indian period through the late Formative period. Accordingly, the focus
was first on patterns of site formation and site structure followed by an examination of the related
issues of technological organization and regional mobility. The presence of a site with structures,
ceramics, and both isolated and clustered hearths offered an opportunity to evaluate forms of
settlement mobility, occupational history, and social arrangements.
The work was performed in two phases. All three sites were evaluated during the initial
fieldwork (Phase I). The goal of Phase I was to characterize the nature and extent of the cultural
deposits at all three sites. Phase I consisted of surface mapping, feature definition, recording of
all surface artifacts, collection of diagnostic artifacts, and geomorphic evaluation of the
depositional units identified in backhoe trenches and assessment of each site’s potential to contain
subsurface cultural materials.
After this initial characterization, GMI determined, in consultation with the Fort Bliss point of
contact, that two (41EP5714/FB 12284 and 41EP6301/FB 12245) of the three sites did not
contain a sufficient amount of cultural material to answer the research questions presented in the
research design. These two sites lacked intact feature remains, had limited quantities of surface
artifacts, and/or lacked a statistically viable sample of artifacts associated with datable features.
In addition, mechanical testing on 41EP6301 (FB 12245) revealed that its’ geomorphic integrity
had been compromised. Therefore, the field and lab time for the two sites was reallocated toward
the more substantial site (41EP970/FB 7520).
Earlier in this chapter, we reviewed the findings of our analyses. When considered together, they
indicate a continued progression of utilization of the central desert basin through time. Site
41EP970 (FB 7520) contains components ranging from the Early Archaic period through
Formative period, with the majority of occupations dating to the Late Archaic. The dearth of
burned bones in association with excavated features suggests that during the Middle and Late
Archaic period, hunting may not have been an activity associated with these occupations.
Although, the recovery of a few burned fragments associated with features that have been
radiocarbon dated to the Late Archaic period, indicates that there was some processing of area
fauna during this occupation of the site.
The chipped-stone assemblage was dominated by cores and debitage, but an unusually high
proportion of tools was also present. It is evident from the analysis that lower proportions of
flake debitage and significantly higher proportions of tools are present in the two earlier
components, indicating greater emphasis on tool production and maintenance. The assemblage
was not dominated by primary or late-stage reduction, was composed of both locally available
and distant sources of material, and was fairly evenly divided between very fine-to-fine grained
and medium-to-coarse grained raw materials, indicating that both plant and animal remains were
processed at the site. Platform data, the high incidence of noncortical debitage, and flake length

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

and thickness data all support the inference that both core reduction and reduction and tool
production/maintenance activities were carried out at the site. This may be a reflection of the
individual components present on the site and the activities carried out by those occupants (e.g.,
Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, Mesilla phase), or throughout its occupation, both activities were
performed at the site.

INTRODUCTION
On October 22, 2009, geomorphic investigations were conducted at three archaeological sites in
Maneuver Area 1B, Fort Bliss, Texas (GMI Project 11013.00.016). The investigations were
conducted by David D. Kuehn, David Kuehn Consulting, El Paso, Texas, under a task order with
Geo-Marine, Inc., Plano, Texas. Kuehn was assisted in the field by Tabitha Griffith, GMI. The
purpose of the research, was to determined the geomorphic context of cultural-bearing sediments
and soils at the sites and to evaluate the likelihood that at any given site the preservation of
systemic context may be sufficient to address a broad range of formulated research questions and
research domains as part of larger, integrated approach needed to manage cultural resources at
Fort Bliss. To this end, field work focused on the excavation and interpretation of backhoe trench
profiles placed within the three site areas. In this manner, the geomorphic work served as an
adjunct to the archaeological site evaluations.

NATURAL PHYSIOGRAPHIC, GEOLOGIC, AND
GEOMORPHIC SETTING
The 11013.00.016 project area is located in the Hueco Bolson portion of the Mexican Highlands
section of the Basin and Range physiographic province. The Hueco Bolson is a prominent downdropped graben flanked on the east and west by mountain ranges and the north by the Tularosa
Basin. These mountain ranges and basins are part of the Basin and Range physiographic
province. The Basin and Range Province is characterized by parallel, northwest to southeasttrending mountain ranges and intervening basins formed by high angle extensional faulting
(Dohrenwend 1987; Hawley and Kottlowski 1969). The province initially formed during the late
Paleozoic and early Mesozoic when late Precambrian and Paleozoic basement rocks experienced
widespread deformation associated with Rocky Mountain orogenic processes (Stewart 1978).
Major extensional faulting within the Basin and Range began between 30 and 35 Ma and
continued locally until the initiation of a second major phase about 17 Ma. The later extension
episode is responsible for the classic Basin and Range structure of high-angle block faulting that
characterizes the region today (Christiansen and McKee 1978; Eaton 1982). Large-scale
extensional deformation generally ended in the Mexican Highlands section between 6 and 4 Ma
(Menges and McFadden 1981), however more local/regional deformation continued well into the
Quaternary, and continues, to a lesser extent, to the present day (Morrison et al. 1981).

The Mexican Highlands section represents the eastern/southeastern most extent of the Basin and
Range and is characterized as transitional between the Sonoran Desert to the southwest and the
Colorado Plateau to the north (Dohrenwend 1987:305).
The survey area investigated in Maneuver Area 1B is located in a basin-floor environment
dominated by eolian sand dunes, sand sheets, interdunal deflationary areas, nearby playa lakes,
normal faults, and fault trough playas. Named stratigraphic units that are temporally and
lithologically analogous to these deposits include the Q1, Q3 and Q4 units of the model
developed by Blair et al. (1990). The Q1 through Q4 model was developed specifically for basinfloor depositional environments.
The Q1 unit was deposited between ca. 50,000 and 250,000 years ago and contains soils with
Stage III to Stage IV carbonates (many nodules to laminar/plugged horizons) and Btk-K-Bk
profiles (Blair et al. 1990). The Q3 unit in the Tularosa Basin was deposited between ca. 100 and
7300 years ago (Blair et al. 1990). Q3 soils are generally poorly developed and exhibit A-Bw-C
or A-Bk-C profiles with Stage I carbonates (Blair et al. 1990). Finally, Q4 deposits are Historic in
age and apply to eolian coppice dunes and sand sheets.

FIELD AND LABORATORY METHODS
The field research was conducted by examining and sampling five backhoe trenches located
within the three site areas. These sites are: FB 7520, FB 12284, and FB 12245. One trench was
placed at FB 12284 (BHT 1), one trench was placed at FB 12245 (BHT 3), and three trenches
were investigated at FB 7520 (BHT’s 1, 2. and 7). The walls of each of the trenches were
carefully examined for soil composition, stratigraphic unit arrangement, and the presence of
prehistoric archaeological materials.
Soils collected from the five backhoe trenches were analyzed using at the GMI Offices in El
Paso, Texas by Tabitha Griffith. Diagnostic attributes recorded at this time included unit and
horizon designation, horizon topography, texture, soil color (moist), soil consistency, reaction to
10% hydrochloric acid, and special features. The analytical criteria used during the analysis
follows those established by the Soil Survey Staff (1990) and the Natural Resources Conservation
Service (2004).

RESULTS OF THE TRENCH INVESTIGATIONS
The three archaeological sites comprising GMI project 11013.00.016 were located in basin floor
environments typical of the Hueco Bolson in far western Texas. Geomorphic landforms common
in such settings include: (1) Q3-aged sand sheet deposits exhibiting various degrees of site
preservation potential; (2) Q3-aged coppice dunes and associated interdunal deflationary areas;
(3) playa lakes of various sizes and potential water sources; (4) possible faults, fault troughs, and
fault trough playas; Soils in the general project area include Q4/C, Q3/A, Q3/Bk. Q2/Btk, and
Q1/2Bkm (Pleistofene-aged petrocalcic); It is the preservation and arrangement of these major
horizons the provides a means with which to evaluate cultural resources potential. We begin with
site FB 7520.

Site 41EP970/FB 7520
Site FB 7520 is a geomorphologically diverse site located near the margins of a small fault trough
in an area dominated by large coppice dunes, primarily shallow interdunal deflated aeas and yet a
great deal of variation with regard to the thickness of Q-aged soils and sediments. The generally
shallow dunes are covered with mesquite, four wing saltbush, and prickly pear cactus. The area
B-4

Appendix B

appeared to have a geomorphic surface somewhat conducive to good cultural resource
preservation. Fort this reason, three backhoe trenches were excavated within the site area. We
begin with Trench 1.

Backhoe Trench 1.
This trench was 9.0 m long by 1.70 m deep. It contained a thick Q4/C, Q3/Ab, Q3/Bw, and
Q3/Bk horizon sequence. The upper Q4 sediments reflect a thick unit of Historic eolian fine
sand(7.5YR 4/6 moist). This massive unit has a maximum width of 0.80 m. The Q3 Ab soil
extended from 0.80 m to 1.39 m below surface. It was comprised of loamy sand (7.5YR 4/3
moist). The Q3 Bw soil extended to a depth of 1.89 m below the surface and was comprised of
loamy sand (7.5YR 4/4 moist). THE lowest soil exposed in BHT 1 at FB 7520 was a Q3 Bk
horizon of sandy clay loam (5YR 4/4 moist). This horizon extended to the bottom of the trench.

Backhoe Trench 2
Backhoe Trench 2 at FB7520 was comprised of a very simple Q4/C and underlying Q3 /A
horizons in keeping with previous geomorphic models for the Tularosa Basin and the Hueco
Bolson.
Q4 in Trench 2 ranged in thickness from 5 cm along the western wall to over 65 cm throughout
other portions of the trench exposure. This brings the thickness of the Q3 Bk horizon in excess of
0.80 m in areas where the horizon has been covered by Q4 coppice dunes, These areas also
correspond to a thin Ab paleosol, or weak, former surface soil that has been cutoff during the
historic period by buildup of the coppice dune. Consequently, by the time much of the fomer
grass-covered sand sheet landform in the site area was lost to erosion, the weak A horizon soil
that was forming since at least Mesilla Phase times, was truncated with the return to more mesic
climatic conditions sometime after the Mesilla, but before the onset of the El Paso phase.

Backhoe Trench 7
Trench 7 cut into a large to medium sized coppice dune revealing Q4 eolian C horizons
sediments, an underlying Q3 Ab paleosol, and a basal Bw/Bk horizon of Q3 sands. The C
horizon dune sediments is comprised of loamy sand (7.5YR 4/6 moist). The dune sands extended
from the surface to a depth of 0.75 m where they were underlain by a thin Ab soil of Q3 age. The
paleosol was less than 5 cm thick and comprised of loamy sand (5RY 4/4 moist). This soil had
weak subangular blocky structure and dry, slightly hard consistence. It was in turn underlain by a
Bw/Bk horizon of Q3 age that extended to the bottom of the trench at 1.35 m. The Bw/Bk was
comprised of loamy sand grading downward to sandy loam 7.5YR 4/4 to 7.5YR4/3 moist). The
Bw had weak structure while the Bk had moderate medium subangular blocky structure. Of note
was the presence of a small thermal feature (prehistoric) exposed in the Bw horizon sediments at
a depth of 1.0 to 1.10 m.

Site 41EP6301/FB 12245
A single backhoe trench was investigated at site FB 12245, a basin floor site that is unusual due
to its lack of developed coppice dunes. The surface geomorphology at this site is classified as a
flat to low-relief sand sheet of Q3 and Q4 age. It is also apparently quite disturbed by Historic
activity such as roads and military maneuvers. Backhoe Trench 3 was the trench that was
intensively investigated at site FB 12245. Trench 3 contained two Historic eolian sand sheet C
horizons, a C1 surface unit with weak soil structure and a C2 horizon that was structureless. The
C1 was sand (7.5YR 4/6 moist) while the C2 was loamy sand (7.5YR 4/6 moist). The lower C2,
B-5

Mitigation of Three Sites in TA 1B on Fort Bliss, El Paso County, Texas

located from 0.20 to 0.45 cm below the surface, was underlain by a thin buried A horizon soil
(Q3 age). The A horizon was 0.18 m thick and comprised of loamy sand (7.5YR 4/3 moist).
This former surface soil was underlain by a Q3 Bk horizon that extended to the bottom of the
trench at 0.85 m. The Bk was comprised of sandy clay loam (5YR 4/4 moist).

Site 41EP5714/FB 12284
Backhoe Trench 1 at site FB12284 exposed a fairly thick sequence of eolian Q4 and Q3-aged
sediments. The Q4 was limited to a surface horizon of small coppice dune loamy sand (7.5YR
4/6 moist). This was underlain by a buried A horizon of loamy sand (5YR 4/4 moist). This Q3
horizon was 0.40 m thick and underlain by Bk1 and Bk2 horizons. The Bk1 was sandy loam
(7.5YR 4/4 moist) while the Bk2 was sandy clay loam (5YR 4/4 moist). These horizons extended
to the bottom of the trench at 1.55 m below the surface.

SUMMARY
Geomorphic investigations at sites FB 7520, FB 11245 and FB 12284 indicate fairly thick Q3 and
Q4 eolian sequences with possible modern surface disturbance. In all three sites Q4, or historicaged eolian coppice dunes or flat sand sheets were present, underlain by Q3 (middle to late
Holocene) sheet sands. The latter are preserved in A, Bk, and Bw horizons and have thicknesses
approaching 1.60 in place. The archaeological potential in the Q3 soils is good for Formative and
possibly Archaic-aged archaeological materials with preservation potential appearing fair to
good. Site FB 7520 is well preserved with the notable presence of Ab paleosols in all three
trenches that were investigated here. The Ab soil was also found at the other two sites, GB 11245
and FB 12284, but its thickness varied. Older Bw and especially Bk horizons were also noted at
all three sites. At FB 12284 two Bk horizons are preserved.

Plant Remains from 41EP970 (FB7520)
Phil Dering, Shumla Archeobotanical Services
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an assessment of the botanical assemblage recovered
from 41EP970. Four flotation samples were submitted for analysis. The data will be utilized to
assess the nature and condition of the plant remains from these sites and provide some evidence
for plant utilization and local environmental conditions.

Methods
Flotation is a method of recovering organic remains from archeological sediments by using water
to separate heavy or soluble inorganic particles from plant parts and small animal bone. The
material floating to the surface is called the light fraction, and this is caught on a fine mesh screen
or strainer. The material that sinks to the bottom is the heavy fraction and it is also caught on a
fine mesh screen. Most of the soil including clay and silt is suspended in water and passes
through the screens and is either recycled or discarded. In this study, the light fractions were
submitted for analysis.
The analysis followed standard archeobotanical laboratory procedures. The volume of the light
fraction is first measured. In most cases up to 100 ml of light fraction from each sample is set
aside for analysis. Then the portion to be analyzed is passed through a nested set of screens of
4mm, 2mm, 1mm, and 0.450mm mesh and examined for charred material, which is separated for
identification. The heavy fraction is also scanned for charcoal, which is set aside for
identification. The results are combined with identifications from each corresponding light
fraction. In the current study I sorted through the entire volume of each light fraction that was
submitted for analysis.
Plant material is sorted into two categories –woody fragments, and seed/fruit fragments including
maize or agave parts when present. Identification of carbonized wood was accomplished by
using the snap technique, examining the fragments at 8 to 45 magnifications with a hand lens or a
binocular dissecting microscope, and comparing the material to samples in the archeobotanical
herbarium. All seed identifications were made using seed manuals and reference collections at
Shumla Archeobotanical Services. Only charred plant material is included in the analysis,
because uncarbonized material is consumed by insects, fungi and bacteria and does not survive
more than a few years in the deposits of open sites.
Up to 25 wood charcoal fragments large enough to be manipulated are examined and identified
from each flotation sample. Fragments smaller than 2- or 3- mm can not be manipulated. They
are usually placed in the indeterminate category. When a sample contains more than 25
fragments, the rest of the material is scanned to make sure that no other taxa are present. Then
the volume of the charcoal is measured and included along with its weight in the report. Wood
charcoal is abundant in the 41EP970 samples. A scan of the entire sample demonstrated that
most of the identifiable wood charcoal is mesquite. The results for each sample are presented in
tabular format.
Disturbance Indicators. Sample content may be affected by various biological disturbance
factors, including insect or small mammal activity, and plant root growth. In an effort to assess
this impact, the amounts of insect parts, termite pellets, gastropods, mammal remains (including
fecal pellets), and modern uncharred seeds are estimated for each flotation sample. These
amounts are reported on a scale of 1-5 (+), 6-25 (++), 26-50 (+++), and over 50 (++++). In this
study lagomorph feces and fresh seeds suggest substantial biological disturbance occurs at this
site.

Results and Discussion
Results of the analysis are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 lists the sample proveniences,
disturbance factors, and total charcoal. Identifications and counts of plant material recovered
from each sample, including the macrobotanical sample, appear in Table 2. Charred plant
material is abundant in the flotation samples. The total charcoal in each sample varied from 6.4 g
to 158.8 g. Disturbance indicators were abundant, and sand, usually absent from light fractions,
was present in one of the samples. Roots and insect parts constituted the majority of the
disturbance indicators, two samples contain uncharred seeds, and one sample contains juniper leaf
fragments.

The most abundant plant material is charred mesquite wood. Other wood types include a small
quantity of saltbush-type wood and a diffuse porous type wood that I could not identify, as well
as unidentifiable charred plant material that lacked diagnostic anatomical features of any type.
Features 79 and 81.5 contain large quantities of mesquite wood charcoal along with a few
fragments of saltbush-type wood. Most of the mesquite wood is heartwood or roots – I did not
see any mesquite thorns, pod fragments, or seeds. Features 74.6 and 81.3 contain moderate
quantities of mesquite with a few mesquite thorns and saltbush fragments.

Conclusion
The four flotation samples contain mesquite wood charcoal and a few fragments of saltbush-type
wood. No charred seeds, agave parts, or other evidence of edible plant remains were noted.
Although charred plant material is abundant in the samples, the analysis does not provide new
information regarding prehistoric vegetation or the economic patterns at 41EP970.
