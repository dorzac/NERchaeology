INTRODUCTION
Texas GSA Holdings, LP, would like to purchase a 2.203-acre tract at 10703 Stancliff Road in
southwestern Houston (Figure 1). The interior of the extant building will be renovated for use by
the Social Security Administration and a parking structure may potentially be constructed. GeoMarine, Inc. (GMI), was contracted by Mr. Ron Moore to evaluate the project area for potential
impacts to cultural resources properties eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP; GMI project # 30576.00.02). Fieldwork was conducted on June 21, 2007, by
Steven Hunt of GMI. Mikel Travisano of GMI served as the architectural historian, and Melissa
M. Green was Principal Investigator for the project.
The project area is currently occupied by the Iglesia Sobre La Roca (Church on the Rock)
Houston. The property consists of a one-story, concrete and glass building with associated
parking (Figure 2). Small landscaped areas surround the building, and a few large trees line
Stancliff Road. Commercial properties are present east, west, and north of the property, and an
apartment complex lies to the south.
The project area is approximately 365 meters (m) north of Keegans Bayou. East of U.S. 59, the
channel is sinuous and is likely part of the original bayou. The stream has been channelized west
of U.S. 59; some straightening is visible on the aerials in the 1976 Soil Survey of Harris County
(Wheeler 1976). On the 2002 USGS aerial photo, the channel is very regular with little sinuosity:
only long straight sections and gentle curves are visible.
The project area is underlain by the Pleistocene-age Beaumont Formation. This formation is
fluvatile in origin and is formed primarily by deposits from stream channels, point bars, natural
levees, and backswamps, while coastal marsh and mud flat deposits make up a smaller portion.
The surface expression of the formation consists of “relict river channels shown by meander
patterns and pimple mounds on meanderbelt ridges, separated by areas of low, relatively smooth
backswamp deposits without pimple mounds” (Bureau of Economic Geology 1992). The
formation is mostly clay, silt, and sand, with mineral concretions, such as clacium carbonate, iron
oxide, and iron-manganese oxide, found in the zone of weathering.
The project area is mapped in the Bernard-Edna complex. The Bernard-Edna complex forms in
broad areas of the coastal plain. It is composed of approximately 55 percent Bernard soil and 30
percent Edna soil, with the remainder composed of closely associated soils such as Addicks, Lake
Charles, or Clodine. Edna soils are found on convex knolls, ridges and circular pimple mounds,
and Bernard soils are found in shallow depressions and in the flat areas between areas of Edna
soil. The typical profile for the Bernard soil begins with a very dark gray clay loam
approximately 15 centimeters (cm; 6 inches [in]) thick. The underlying B horizon consists of
very dark gray clay from 15 to 86 cm (6–34 in) below surface, dark gray clay from 86 to 137 cm
(34–54 in) below surface, and gray clay from 137 to 165 cm (54–65 in) below surface (Wheeler
1976:12–13, 48–49). The Edna portion of the complex begins with a dark grayish brown fine
sandy loam about 25 cm (10 in) deep. The B horizon begins abruptly with a clay horizon from 25
to 112 cm (10–44 in) below surface that is gray in the upper part and olive gray in the lower part.
This in turn is underlain by a gray sandy clay loam with yellowish brown mottling (Wheeler
1976:12–13, 50–51).

METHODS
The Texas State Site Atlas was consulted before beginning fieldwork. One site (41HR564) is
mapped within a 1-mile radius of the project area. This prehistoric site was discovered during the
survey of Beltway 8. The artifacts collected consisted of a possible Ensor point and a flake tool.
The site was associated with a dark soil lens along a drainage channel, but “the site appeared to
be thin and sparse.” Testing was recommended to ‘determine [the] extent of the [the] site and
possible cultural affiliations” (Denton 1985). No National Register-listed properties or State
Archeological Landmarks are shown within the 1-mile radius.
Limited archival research was done for the project area. Two historic highway maps were
located: the General Highway Map of Harris County for 1939 and 1961 (Texas State Highway
Department [TSHD] 1939, 1961). No structures or roads are mapped near the project area on the
1936 map. The existing road net is not shown on the 1961 map. Instead, a graded and drained
road is shown extending northwest from U.S. 59. The project area is on the north side of this
road. A structure is mapped north of the road, but closer to U.S. 59, and four structures are
mapped on the south side of the road. Three aerial photographs were examined for the project.
The aerial photographs in the Soil Survey of Harris County, Texas (Wheeler 1976) were flown in
1972; they show the existing road net in place, but little development. The only building near the
project area is the Chevron building facing Wilcrest Drive. Both the 1995 and 2002 USGS aerial
photographs show the project area as totally developed; all of the buildings within the APE
appear to be present (Terraserver 1995, 2002).
The project area is largely covered by either the building or parking lot, making an archeological
survey infeasible. The architectural evaluation involved not only the project area, but a halfblock area of potential effects (APE) surrounding the project area. All buildings within the
project area or APE were digitally photographed for later examination by Mikel Travisano, an
architectural historian with GMI. All photographs were recorded on standardized forms.

RESULTS
As noted previously, an archeological examination of the property was not feasible due the
extensive development found within. In addition to Iglesia Sobre La Roca, six buildings are
found within the APE. Three of the buildings are only part of larger complexes of essentially
similar buildings (i.e., the Tradewind Apartments and the Chevron campus). Finally, four of the
greenhouses at the Great Western Growers are also included in the APE.
The Iglesia Sobre La Roca is an irregular plan, one-story, concrete and glass structure (Figure 3).
A floor-to-ceiling glass curtain wall wraps around three-quarters of the building starting at the
northeast corner. Placed above the curtain walls are coarse-surfaced, precast concrete panels
functioning as a fascia. The building’s remaining walls are concrete. The primary façade is set
back behind a low concrete retaining wall functioning as an elevated planter. The building is
surrounded by landscaped grounds and a large concrete parking lot. Based on the evidence of the
aerial photographs, the building was constructed between 1972 and 1995. It does not exhibit the
exceptional significance required for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion Consideration G.

southwest from Stancliff Road.

The Great Western Growers nursery is immediately east of the project area. A small
prefabricated office is south of Stancliff Road (Figure 4); the rest of the property contains plants
and greenhouses (Figure 5). Both the office and the greenhouses are less than 50 years in age and
do not exhibit the exceptional significance required for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion
Consideration G.
A two-story office building at 10707 Stancliff Road is immediately west of the project area
(Figure 6). This late-modernist building is a steel frame structure covered with precast concrete
panels. The building is banded by three rows of dark glass, fixed-sash ribbon windows. It is less
than 50 years in age and does not exhibit the exceptional significance required for inclusion in the
NRHP under Criterion Consideration G.
The Tradewind Apartments are immediately south of the project area and consist of several
similar buildings, one of which is illustrated in Figure 7. This two-story multi-unit facility was
built in an eclectic style. The units on the first floor feature brick-surfaced walls and covered
patios. The units on the second floor feature balconies and wood-shingled faux mansard roofs,
which form the walls. These buildings are not present on the 1972 aerial photograph. They do
not exhibit the exceptional significance required for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion
Consideration G.

The True Light Trinity Christian Center is a one-story, dark brown brick building northeast of the
project area (Figure 8), on the north side of Stancliff Road. The building is surrounded by a grass
lawn densely populated with small trees and shrubs. This building also is less than 50 years in
age and does not exhibit the exceptional significance required for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion Consideration G.

A Chevron facility is northwest of the project area (Figure 9). It is composed of three separate
tan brick buildings constructed in the brutalism style. The building’s large glass windows are set
back from the projecting brick walls. Although the building facing Wilcrest Road is present on
the 1972 aerial photograph, the building within the APE was not yet built. That building does not
display the exceptional significance required for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion
Consideration G.

RECOMMENDATIONS
As discussed in previous sections, this portion of Houston did not start to grow until the 1960s.
The existing road net does not appear on the 1961 General Highway Map (TSHD 1961), but was
built by 1972, when the aerials in the Harris County soil survey (Wheeler 1976) were flown. In
addition, none of the buildings within the APE is on the 1972 aerials.

The extensive development that has occurred within the project area precluded an archeological
examination of the property. However, it appears likely that the construction of Iglesia Sobre La
Roca would have extensively disturbed, if not destroyed, any cultural deposits that might have
existed within the project area. Therefore, it is considered likely that the property does not
contain significant, intact cultural deposits.
As noted previously, seven buildings, as well as four greenhouses, are present within the project
area and surrounding APE. The limited archival research undertaken indicates that none of these
buildings was present in 1972, when the aerial photographs bound with the Soil Survey of Harris
County, Texas, were taken. All of the buildings are considered ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP, as they lack the exceptional significance required of buildings less than 50 years in age
under Criterion Consideration G. Consequently, it is recommended that the proposed purchase
and renovation of 10703 Stancliff Road will have no impact upon potentially significant
arecheological or architectural properties.
