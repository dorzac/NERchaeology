INTRODUCTION AND PROPOSED SCOPE OF THE
ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY
At the request of the National Park Service (NPS), Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC
prepared a research design in support of a 2009 NPS Challenge Cost Share Project (CCSP) proposal entitled
“Archeological survey to identify 17th-early 19th Century Caddo sites along El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail in East Texas.” The NPS awarded this CCSP contract to our firm in September 2009.
The archeological survey investigations began in November 2009 and continued intermittently through March
2010 by personnel from Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC. Timothy K. Perttula, Ph.D.,
served as the Principal Investigator for the project, and Bo Nelson served as the Project Archeologist.
The principal objective of the project is to employ archeological survey methods and techniques, in
combination with existing archeological, historical, archival, and map information, to identify significant
Caddo Indian sites in East Texas that were occupied during the late 17th-early 19th century period of use of
the El Camino Real de los Tejas corridor. Our objectives are to (1) obtain landowner permissions to conduct
archeological surveys in key trail corridor areas, (2) conduct intensive archeological survey investigations
of six of the highest site potential areas for Historic Caddo sites based on the available archeological and
historical information, and (3) identify and document significant Caddo archeological resources along and
associated with the El Camino Real de los Tejas routes in East Texas. The result of these actions will first be
the identification of Historic Caddo sites in the immediate vicinity of the trail routes, and that will lead to a
better appreciation of the purpose and history of the El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail. The
second result will be the completion of a document that will summarize current archaeological findings along
the trail, and provide recommendations for future archeological studies along the trail corridor.
In this report, we first discuss relevant archeological and archival/historical information concerning
the historic Caddo settlement in the East Texas region, and in the immediate vicinity of the Camino Real
de los Tejas, followed by a discussion of the various areas we have proposed for archeological survey.
The next section of the report outlines the archeological survey methodology we intended to employ in
the proposed archeological survey areas to locate historic Caddo settlements in the immediate vicinity
of the Camino Real de los Tejas. We also discuss how we intended to handle the recovery, analysis, and
curation of recovered artifacts from proposed private and state land archeological survey areas, followed
by a discussion of the report preparation tasks arising from the archeological survey investigations, and the
contents of the final report.
The heart of the report concerns the presentation of the results of the archeological survey investigations
at several survey tracts along and adjacent to El Camino Real de los Tejas in East Texas. These results
include summarizing the work done at new and/or previously recorded Historic Caddo archeological sites in
those tracts, and discussing in detail the recovered and/or documented material culture remains and animal
bones from these sites as evidence of when the sites were occupied and their nature.

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites
CADDO SETTLEMENT OF EAST TEXAS AND THE CAMINO REAL DE LOS TEJAS:
RELEVANT ARCHEOLOGICAL AND ARCHIVAL/HISTORICAL INFORMATION

The Caddo Indian peoples lived in East Texas from at least as early as A.D. 800 until the late 1830s
(Figure 1). First visited by Europeans in 1542, the remnants of the De Soto entrada (Bruseth and Kenmotsu
1993) described to chroniclers that the Caddo in East Texas lived in scattered but dispersed settlements
with abundant food reserves of corn. The entrada moved along pre-existing east-west and north-south
Caddo trails through East Texas, and from Hasinai Caddo groups in the Neches-Angelina River basins to
Cadohadacho groups on the Red River. The east-west aboriginal trail in most particulars became subsumed
within the later East Texas portions of the El Camino Real de los Tejas first established by the Spanish in the
late 17th century (Williams 2007:Figure 8).
Archeological investigations carried out in East Texas since the early 20th century confirm that Caddo
communities were widely dispersed throughout all of the major and minor river valleys of the region.
The most intensive settlement of the region may have been after ca. A.D. 1400, especially in the NechesAngelina River basin (Story 1995; Perttula and Nelson 2006; Middlebrook 2007). By the mid-1600s, the
Hasinai Caddo peoples of East Texas were referred to by the Spanish as the “Great Kingdom of the Tejas”
because they were considered to be a populous and well-governed people.
When Europeans began to venture into East Texas in the 1680s and 1690s, the territory of the various
Hasinai Caddo tribes became well understood (see Berlandier 1969; Jackson 1999; R. H. Jackson 2004).
The area known to have been occupied by the Caddo in the late 17th century was also called “Tejas” by
the Spanish, while the French called the Caddo in this area the “Cenis” (Figure 2). The Nabedache Caddo
villages on San Pedro Creek were the principal entranceway to the lands of the Hasinai Caddo tribes that
lived in the Neches and Angelina River basins, and one of the routes of the Camino Real—El Camino Real
de los Tejas—came to and through this place from the late 17th to the early 19th century (Corbin 1991;
Cunningham 2006; McGraw et al. 1991).
In historic times, the archeology of the Hasinai Caddo groups is associated with the Allen phase (ca.
A.D. 1650-early 1800s). “The Allen phase is believed to have developed out of the Frankston phase [ca.
A.D. 1400-1650], and more importantly, to have shared the same form of organization, kinds of inter-group
interaction, and settlement patterns” (Story and Creel 1982:34). The groups who during the Allen phase
occupied the Neches (the Rio aux Cenis) and Angelina river basins were direct ancestors of the Hasinai
tribes (see Figure 2) who were living in or near the Spanish missions that had been periodically established
and maintained in the region between ca. 1690-1731, and they continued to live there until the 1830s (see
Jackson 1999:Plate 98).
Story and Creel (1982:32) have suggested that the Allen phase populations were organized in a
“weakly hierarchical structure” analogous to the Hasinai confederacy (see Swanton 1942). Allen phase
components are found in the Neches and Angelina River basins in Cherokee, Anderson, Houston, Rusk, and
Nacogdoches counties (Erickson and Corbin 1996; Middlebrook 2007; Perttula 2005; Perttula and Nelson
2006; Story 1982, 1995). These Historic Caddo sites contain small amounts of European trade goods found in
village contexts, along with a variety of decorated and plain Caddo ceramic wares, triangular and unstemmed
arrow points, elbow pipes, ground stone tools, and bone tools. Most Allen phase sites were apparently
occupied for only short periods of time, perhaps an average of 20 to 40 years (Good 1982:67-69).

Figure 2. Redrawn version of Guillaume Delisle Map, 1702, “Carte de Canada et du Mississippi.” The
Nouidiches or Nabedache lived on San Pedro Creek near its confluence with the Neches River.
Allen phase Caddo communities were apparently composed of many farmsteads spread out over a
considerable distance. In 1687, in the community of Nabedache Caddo on San Pedro Creek in Houston
County (see Figure 2), Henri Joutel noted that:
we took the path to the village where the Indians conducted us to the chief’s hut which was a long
league’s distance from the entrance to the village. On the way, we passed several huts that were
grouped in hamlets; there were seven or eight of them, each with twelve to fifteen huts together
with space between each other and fields around the huts (Foster 1998:206).
Individual Hasinai Caddo families lived in their farmsteads, and a number of farmsteads were organized
into rancherias spread out over about 15-30 leagues (ca. 39-78 miles) of stream valleys and arable lands.
Each rancheria was separated from the others by unoccupied lands and hunting territory (Foster 1998:208).

The Spanish were determined to have effective control of the East Texas lands, thus minimizing the
French influence, and bring missions to the Caddo peoples (R. H. Jackson 2005:22-23, 26; Wade 2008:107113). Between 1690 and 1719, the Spanish established a number of missions among the Hasinai Caddo
in East Texas, with most of them situated in the middle of Caddo communities and along what became
the Camino Real de los Tejas (Figures 3-5). Despite the efforts of the missionaries, the Caddo refused to
congregate in the vicinity of the missions, and no Caddo peoples were converted to Christianity; baptisms
“were administered to [Caddo] people who had died or were dying, half of whom were children” (Wade
2008:112).
These missions included: Mission San Francisco de los Tejas (1690-1693) on San Pedro Creek a few
miles from its confluence with the Neches River; Mission El Santissimo de Nombre Maria (1690-1692)

los Nasonis have been located on the ground through archeological investigations (Corbin et al. 1990;
Perttula et al. 2009). A presidio, Presidio Nuestra Senora de los Dolores de los Tejas (1716-1719, 17211730), was also established in 1716 by the Spanish in what is now East Texas near Mission Concepcion
and one of the Camino Real de los Tejas trail crossings of the Angelina River (see Figure 1). The precise
location of the presidio has never been established, however.
Delisle’s map of 1702 (see Figure 2) shows that the westernmost Caddo groups (the Cenis) were
living on and near the Neches River, west of the Neches on San Pedro Creek. In the 1720s-1750s, the
Hainai Caddo lived to the east on the Angelina River (see Figure 3), while the Nadaco and Nasoni were
in communities to the north and west—apparently above the Camino Real—and a series of Cenis or
Hasinai communities were along the western boundaries of their territory. The San Pedro or Nabedache
Caddo were living east of the Trinity River and west of the Neches River (see Figure 3). At these times,
Spanish missionaries were living in the midst of certain Caddo peoples at Mission Nuestra Senora de los
Nacogdoches and Mission Nuestra Senora de los Ais (see Figure 4). A 1771 map by Jose de Urrutia show
Caddo groups living north and west of these two missions (see Figure 5). The missions at Nacogdoches and
Ais were abandoned in 1772 and 1773, respectively.
Because of the regular outbreaks of epidemics among the East Texas Caddo, especially outbreaks at
the Spanish settlement of Nacogdoches in the late 1770s and early 1780s, Caddo populations declined
precipitously through the colonial era (Table 1). Caddo groups moved their villages, or coalesced into
one village for protection. The Hasinai Caddo groups—the Nacogdoche, Hainai, the Hasinai, the Nadaco,
Ais, and the Nabedache—remained in their East Texas homelands, living in the early 1800s outside of the
Spanish settlements of Nacogdoches (see Perttula 2008a), west to the Neches River, and apparently north of
the El Camino Real (Figures 6a-b). Between about 1836 and 1839, the Hasinai tribes had all been forcibly
pushed out of East Texas, and they either moved to Indian Territory, or farther west in Texas (in the upper
Trinity and Brazos River basins, see Neighbours 1973, 1975).

RESEARCH APPROACH AND METHODS
Areas proposed for archeological survey
The first task of the archeological survey effort on this NPS Challenge Cost Share project was to
identify and contact landowners in selected high site potential areas for Historic Caddo sites in the El
Camino Real de los Tejas corridor in East Texas, and secure permission from them to conduct archeological
survey investigations in areas considered likely to contain intact Historic Caddo sites. Consequently, in
areas that are in the vicinity to the trail corridor, we selected a number of different survey locations to
increase the likelihood that we would be able to secure landowner permission for most, if not all of the,
proposed survey tracts.
These proposed survey areas associated with the El Camino Real de los Tejas trail have been defined
from relevant available archeological (including archeological site databases maintained by the State of
Texas), archival, historical, and map resources that are known to have information on the known or likely
locations of late 17th-early 19th century Caddo sites in East Texas (see also Perttula and Cast 2010). The
selected high site potential areas defined for this Challenge Cost Share are in several different areas in the
immediate vicinity of the routes defined by the National Park Service that traverse the Neches and Angelina
River basins in East Texas.
The first two proposed survey areas are in western Nacogdoches County, in the King Creek, Legg
Creek, and Angelina River valleys. There are a number of known Historic Caddo sites in these stream
valleys (Figure 7a; see Middlebrook 2007). The first proposed archeological survey area is in the King
Creek valley (Figure 7b), in the vicinity of the J. T. King site (41NA15) on the Hwy. 21 route of the Camino
Real (in the northern part of the survey area, adjacent to the 312 elevation benchmark on the south side of
Hwy. 21, Figure 7b), as well as a second and southern NPS-plotted route of the trail that led to the Angelina
River crossing. The J. T. King site is a known early 18th century Caddo hamlet with preserved structures
and other features (Middlebrook 2007; Walker 2009a; Walker et al. 2009; Walker and Perttula 2010).
The David King site (41NA321) is another Historic Caddo habitation site in this proposed survey
area. It is situated 0.85 miles to the south-southwest of the J. T. King site, in the immediate vicinity of the

southern plotted Camino Real de los Tejas route. We expected that there was a cluster of contemporaneous
Historic Caddo hamlets and houses (cf. Foster 1998:206) along this stretch of King Creek.
The second proposed archeological survey area is in the lower Legg Creek valley and the confluence
of the Angelina River and Legg Creek at the southern Angelina River crossing of the Camino (Figure 8).
This same area is in the vicinity of the suspected locations of Mission Purisima Concepcion and Presidio
Concepcion, at least as posited by the historian Herbert Bolton (Figure 9). According to Ramon in 1716,
when he arrived at the place where he intended to establish Mission Concepcion, after crossing the Angelina
River, there were “an infinity of rancherias” that were part of the “town of the Hasinai” (Cunningham
2006:65).
What is known is that there is a very high density of Historic Caddo settlements already identified on
the lower course of Legg Creek (see Figure 7a; Middlebrook 2007), even though past archeological survey
work has not been particularly intensive or comprehensive. Historic late 17th and 18th century Caddo sites
recorded in the proposed Legg Creek survey area includes: Legg Creek #1 (41NA33), Chayah (41NA44),
Legg Creek #5 (41NA47), Legg Creek #10 (41NA53), and Cecil Sparks (41NA54). It is also known that
a flattened copper container, apparently an 18th century Spanish item of trade, was found in the 1930s in
the eastern part of the proposed survey tract, near the 309 ft. elevation benchmark adjacent to the county
road that leads to an Angelina River crossing (see Figure 8), not far from one posited location for Mission
Concepcion (see Figure 9).
An 1806 map drawn by Juan Pedro Walker (see McGraw et al. 1991:Figure 26; Corbin 1991) of
portions of East Texas and the Camino Real (Route to Bexar) depicts the location of several Historic Caddo
(“Tejas”) sites in the immediate vicinity of the El Camino Real de los Tejas corridor (Figure 10). The first
of these ca. 1806 Caddo settlements, and associated fields, is labeled a “Village des Indians Texas.” It is
situated along Arroyo de la Piedra, modern day Beans Creek, a tributary of the Angelina River.
We have selected two proposed archeological survey areas along the lower and middle reaches of Beans
Creek to search for evidence of this ca. 1806 Tejas Caddo village. These archeological survey areas cover
valley margin landforms known to have been preferred for settlement by Historic Hasinai Caddo groups, in
the immediate vicinity of NPS-plotted routes of the El Camino Real de los Tejas (Figures 11 and 12).
The Juan Pedro Walker map also depicts a ca. 1806 Tejas ranchito just east of the Neches River (see
Figure 10) and immediately north of three “Monuments Indigenes.” These three “monuments” are the three
earthen mounds erected by the prehistoric Caddo at the George C. Davis site (41CE19) (Story 2000), now
included within the boundaries of Caddo Mounds State Historical Site.
The ca. 1806 Tejas ranchito is shown on the east bank of Arroyo de los Carritos, also known as Arroyo
de los Cerritos or Mound(s) Creek, at the intersection of two routes of the Camino Real (see Figure 10).
This is present-day Bowles Creek. One proposed archeological survey area is delineated on the east side
of Bowles Creek in the immediate vicinity of two NPS-plotted Camino routes (Figure 13). A smaller
archeological survey area was proposed along the southeastern margins of the alluvial terrace overlooking
the Neches River as this is within the boundaries of the ca. 1806 ranchito and fields, and in the vicinity of
18th century Spanish pottery reported to have been found in this general area (Newell and Krieger 2000:12
and fn26).1

Figure 10. Redrawn version of ca. 1806 Juan Pedro Walker map of the area from San Pedro Creek on the
west to the Angelina River (see McGraw et al. 1991:Figure 26).

Archeological evidence of Nabedache Caddo settlements that were occupied contemporaneously with
the use of the Camino Real are known along San Pedro Creek (see Figures 1-6a), from near the headwaters
to the confluence of San Pedro Creek and the Neches River (Erickson and Corbin 1996; Marceaux
2007:Tables 1 and 2; Perttula 2005, 2007a; Perttula and Nelson 2006, 2007). These include 41HO6 (with
a Spanish cannon discovered there), 41HO64, 41HO65, and 41HO67 on the north side of San Pedro Creek
(Newell and Krieger 2000; Perttula 2005) and across from Mission Tejas State Park; the Plev Cutler site
(41HO1) on a terrace at the confluence of the Neches River and San Pedro Creek; and 41HO91, 41HO122,
Nabedache Blanco (41HO211), and Nabedache Azul (41HO214) within Mission Tejas State Park (Erickson
and Corbin 1996; Perttula and Nelson 2006, 2007).
Mission San Francisco de los Tejas (1690-1693) was also situated on San Pedro Creek (see Figure 10),
apparently astride the Camino de los Tejas (labeled “Ancienne route de Bexar a Nacogdoches). This mission
was established “in the middle” of the Nabedache village along San Pedro Creek (Bolton 1987:41) and
about 2 leagues from the Neches River.
To archeologically identify Historic Nabedache Caddo villages, hamlets, and farmsteads along
San Pedro Creek in the vicinity of NPS-plotted routes of the Camino Real de los Tejas, a number of
archeological survey tracts were proposed in areas along the margins of the Neches (Figure 14) and San

Pedro (Figures 15-17) stream valleys. Given the dispersed nature of the San Pedro villages, hamlets, and
farmsteads from near its mouth to near its headwaters, and the likely fact that Nabedache Caddo sites were
abandoned and relocated on a regular basis every generation, the proposed survey areas are situated along
the margins of the Neches River valley near the Neches River crossing (Figure 14), on the north and south
sides of the San Pedro near Mission Tejas State Park (Figure 15), in valley margin settings near two forks of
the Camino (Figure 16), and in a broad stretch of the San Pedro Creek valley, in areas of upland toe slopes,
alluvial fans, and floodplain rises at the confluence of several smaller tributaries with San Pedro Creek
(Figure 17)
The last proposed archeological survey included several survey tracts in the area of known early 19th
century Caddo settlements on Grass House Prairie on the upper reaches of San Pedro Creek (Figures 18 and
19) where it is crossed by several routes of the El Camino Real de los Tejas. The “Grass House Prairie” was
apparently named by land surveyors and perhaps as well as members of the Republic of Texas militia during
various campaigns against various East Texas Caddo groups (see Smith 1995:138-141), who attempted
to burn out a Caddo village of grass- and thatch-covered Caddo houses there (Bob D. Skiles, May 2009
personal communication). An early account by John Holland Jenkins stated that:
…in 1839 or 1840, [Gen. Edward] Burleson was returning from an unsuccessful Indian campaign
when one of his men proposed leading the way to a village of Tejas Indians, a hostile tribe that
covered their tents or wigwams with grass. Burleson with the main army paid no special attention
to the information and came on home, but twelve or thirteen men volunteered to accompany the
self-appointed guide, anxious for the excitement and adventure as well as the plunder they might
secure…They struck off to burn the village with its roofs of dry grass. On their way, however, while
they were cutting a bee tree, they were surprised and attacked by a large band of Indians (Jenkins
1987:181).
Grass House Prairie, also known as Murchison’s Prairie after the name of an 1840s Anglo-American
settler, is a natural prairie on the north side of San Pedro Creek (see Figure 18). According to Kennedy
(1892:21):
Murchison’s prairie…comprises an area of about two miles square, extending over a greater portion
of the Jose Maria Procella league, and a portion of the northeastern corner of the Stephen Rodgers
headright. Unlike the prairie regions of the southern portion of the county, Murchison’s prairie
does not owe its existence to lacustrine formation. This prairie, which lies somewhat lower than the
surrounding country, appears to owe its prairie origin and general absence of trees to the impervious
nature of the subsoils…trees are springing up and encroaching upon the treeless area. Like the
prairies in the southern portion of the county, Murchison’s prairie will, in a few years, be as well
wooded as the surrounding country.
The proposed archeological survey areas in the Grass House Prairie locality are situated in two different
landform settings. Four are situated along the margins of the San Pedro Creek valley, on upland ridges and
alluvial fans on both sides of the creek (see Figure 19). The fifth is situated alongside and above southwardflowing tributary of San Pedro Creek and two NPS-plotted crossings of the stream by the El Camino Real
de los Tejas.

Proposed archeological survey methodology

The archeological survey methodology we proposed to use on this project consisted of pedestrian
surface inspections, shovel testing, and/or metal detector investigations in key areas within each of the
proposed survey areas. These areas are alluvial fans, terrace landforms, and floodplain rises that would be
identified along the margins of creek and river valleys that are in the vicinity of NPS plotted routes of the
El Camino Real de los Tejas. Previous archeological investigations of Allen phase sites in the Neches and
Angelina river basins has shown that the preponderance of Historic Caddo habitation sites are found in such
settings across the landscape (Erickson and Corbin 1996; Marceaux 2007; Middlebrook 2007; Perttula and
Cast 2010; Perttula and Nelson 2006, 2007; Perttula et al. 2010; Story 1982, 1995; Walker 2009a).
The pedestrian survey work, with two or more archeological crew members, was designed to search out
and identify key areas within the proposed survey tracts to target for shovel testing and metal detector work,
and then to search for surface evidence of Caddo archeological materials. Shovel tests approximately 35 cm
in diameter would be excavated in key survey areas (see Appendix 1), dug in 20 cm arbitrary levels to an
approximate depth of 100 cm below surface, unless the clay B-horizon was encountered above that depth,
and all sediments would be screened through 1/4-inch mesh to recover artifacts at known depths. GPS
readings with a hand-held GPS would be taken at each of the shovel tests,2 and their locations would then
be plotted on site maps that would be prepared at the conclusion of the shovel testing and metal detector
investigations.
Metal detectors were to be used, in conjunction with the findings from shovel tests, in general sweeps
across likely site areas and identified sites, to gain an impression of the kinds of metal artifacts preserved
on the sites (if any), and their spatial location and density. We proposed to use a Prizm III/IV White’s metal
detector on the project, as this machine successfully performed on two recent survey investigations of
Historic Caddo sites on San Pedro Creek (Perttula and Nelson 2006, 2007). The metal detector would be
set at full discrimination range to detect all categories of metal types, and the metal detector coils would
be kept parallel to the ground and as close as possible to the ground. Each shovel test excavated to explore
possible metal detector hits would have a GPS reading to obtain UTMs, so that their locations could be
accurately plotted within the site and within the survey tracts. Meaningful metallic artifacts to be recovered
and documented would be recognizable pre-1830s metal artifacts, including (but not restricted to) handwrought nails, ammunition (lead balls and shot), metal knives, axes, and gun parts, cuprous artifacts (i.e.,
gun side and butt plates, kettle pieces), and horse gear (including ring bits and higas). Any questionable
metallic artifacts were to be collected for more detailed examination to determine if they may be of pre1830 provenance.
Each of the identified sites documented during the proposed archeological survey investigations are
to be recorded with the State of Texas, and we have proposed to obtain a state site trinomial for the newly
identified sites; previously recorded sites would have updated information provided to the State of Texas. This
recordation effort would be done regardless of whether a particular site appeared to be a Historic Caddo site or
not; our efforts on non-Historical Caddo sites, however, would be minimal, being sufficient to establish (given
the limited survey investigations that could or would be conducted on sites) that the archeological materials
recovered from them were not of the relevant temporal or cultural affiliation, or that information could not
be obtained. The information on recorded sites will eventually be posted on the Texas Historical Sites Atlas
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission.

Recovery, analysis, and curation of recovered artifacts
During the archeological survey investigations, we expected to recover temporally and/or culturally
diagnostic artifacts (Allen phase ceramics, particularly Patton Engraved sherds, and European trade goods)
from Historic Caddo sites in the proposed survey areas, along with undiagnostic pieces of lithic debris, animal
bones, etc. These artifacts were likely to be found in both shovel testing and metal detector sweeps, and
perhaps also from eroded surface contexts.
Recovered artifacts were to be bagged by provenience from shovel tests, metal detector hits, and/or
surface contexts, then washed and sorted by material category (i.e., metal, glass, ceramic, etc.). Their analysis
follows the analysis methods specified in Perttula and Nelson (2006:35-36). For recovered Caddo ceramic
sherds, analyses emphasized the acquisition of information on their stylistic and technological character,
focusing on the definition of recognizable decorative elements, paste characteristics, non-plastic inclusions,
surface treatment, and firing conditions for each sherd in the sherd assemblages. The analysis of any recovered
lithic artifacts focused on the identification of the range of chipped and ground stone tools in each site’s lithic
assemblage to characterize stylistic, functional, and morphological attributes of the tools for documenting
local and regional affiliations of the Caddo peoples living at the sites. For the analysis of European trade
goods as to their age and likely function, we proposed to rely on previously published studies of trade goods
found on late 17th to early 19th century Caddo sites in Texas and northwestern Louisiana (cf. Blaine 1996;
Jelks 1967; Perttula 2005). Metal artifact analysis for this project would depend upon comparisons with the
detailed analysis of gun parts, knives, and horse gear completed by Blaine (1996). If any beads are recovered,
their classification would follow Kidd and Kidd (1970) and Perttula (2005:88-90).
Any diagnostic artifacts recovered from proposed archeological survey investigations on State of Texas
lands (see Figure 13) in the Caddo Mounds State Historic Site proposed survey area were to be retained for
analysis and curation at an approved curation facility (we had proposed using the curation facility at Stephen
F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas, when we submitted our research design to the NPS, but the
Texas Historical Commission has required in the Antiquities Permit they have issued for any archeological
survey on Caddo Mounds State Historic Site that any recovered artifacts and records be curated in the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Archaeology Laboratory in Austin, Texas). Artifacts recovered during archeological
survey investigations on private lands—which comprise all of the remaining proposed survey areas—would
be recovered for analysis and documentation, and then returned to each of the private landowner, the rightful
owners of these materials. We proposed to advise the landowners of the benefits to the study of the local
archeology by the donation of artifacts for curation, and if any of the private landowners so request, any
artifacts recovered from their property would also be curated as a direct donation to the curation facility.
Report preparation
The final result of this project was proposed to be a document (the present document) that summarizes
the archeological findings of our survey efforts to identify important historic Caddo sites along specific
areas of the El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail, and the methods and techniques of
archaeological survey that were employed to identify and document those Caddo sites in those areas. In
addition to summarizing our archeological findings, the final report was to present maps of the relevant areas
that were the subject of this archeological survey project, offer recommendations about the archeological
and historical significance of the identified Historic Caddo sites within the trail corridor, and detail future

30

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites

archeological survey efforts that could be conducted to identify additional Historic Caddo sites that may
promote understanding and appreciation of the El Camino Real de los Tejas trail.
The document would also present information on any temporally and/or culturally diagnostic artifacts
found during the archeological survey. We proposed to discuss in the document which identified sites
appeared to be best suited to promoting both the understanding and appreciation of the nature and character
of Historic Caddo sites along the National Historic Trail.
Finally, the draft of the final report would be submitted to the National Park Service for their review
and comment. The Texas Historical Commission and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma are also expected to
review and/or comment on the draft report, which would be provided to them by the National Park Service.
All review comments are to be taken into account in our preparation of the final report.
RESULTS OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY INVESTIGATIONS
This section of the report primarily discusses the archeological survey investigations completed at
Caddo sites of Historic age (i.e., 17th and early 18th centuries) that are in the various survey tracts situated
adjacent to the NPS-plotted routes of El Camino Real de los Tejas that we were able to obtain archeological
survey access. Because of the importance of the George C. Davis site (41CE19) in any study of Caddo
native history in East Texas (cf. Newell and Krieger 2000; Story 1981, 1997, 1998, 2000), as well as its
location immediately adjacent to El Camino Real de los Tejas, we also discuss the archeological findings
from our survey investigations in one small part of that site (that work was done under an Antiquities Permit
issued by the Texas Historical Commission). Those tracts included: the King Creek Tract (see Figure 7b);
the Pike Tract at Caddo Mounds State Historical Site (see Figure 13); San Pedro Creek tract (Tract 15A)
west of Mission Tejas State Park (see Figure 15); the McLean tract south of Mission Tejas State Park
(see Figure 15); and the Lovell tract on San Pedro Creek, halfway between Mission Tejas State Park and
the confluence of San Pedro Creek with the Neches River (Figure 20); this tract was added to the list of
potential survey tracts when permission could not be secured to conduct archeological surveys on Texas
Forest Service property at the George C. Davis site.
In this section of the report, we summarize the topographic setting of the sites, the work accomplished
there, and the character of the recovered and/or documented material culture remains. Other sites found
during the course of the archeological survey investigations, but that are not 17th-early 19th century Caddo
sites, are discussed in Appendix 2 of this report.
George C. Davis Site (41CE19)
Intensive shovel testing was completed on a ca. 2 acre alluvial terrace (270 feet amsl) tract (Pike Tract),
overlooking Bowles Creek and an intermittent tributary to that creek (see Figure 13), at Caddo Mounds
State Historic Site (Figure 21). Areas to the north of the intermittent tributary were on property then owned
by the Texas Forest Service, and survey access was not granted by that agency for this project. The goal of
the archeological survey was to identify the location of a ranchito shown at this location on a 1806 Juan
Pedro Walker map (see Figure 10). Recent archeogeophysical investigations in this area identified portions
of the El Camino Real de los Tejas route as well as a single row of possible Caddo burials (Creel et al.
2004:10; Walker 2009b:109 and Figure 4.15).

All 24 shovel tests in the Pike tract contained prehistoric and/or historic artifacts in a fine sandy
loam A-horizon deposit that ranged from 20-40 cm in thickness (Table 2; see also Appendix 1). In most
of the shovel tests (ST 1-2, 7-24), the A-horizon sediments are a dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) or a very dark
brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) color. ST 3-6, in the southern part of the tract, have a dark reddish-brown (5YR3/4)
A-horizon. The B-horizon sediments are either a dark red clayey loam (10R 3/6) or a dark red clay.

The mean density of prehistoric artifacts in the shovel testing is 7.6 per positive shovel test (ca. 61 artifacts
per m2); all of the shovel tests contain prehistoric artifacts. The most common prehistoric artifacts are lithic
debris (n=101) and plain and decorated ceramic sherds (n=74). The highest densities of prehistoric artifacts
are concentrated in five shovel tests in the western part of the shovel testing area (ST 1, 2, 16, 20, and 24)
(see Figure 21 and Table 2). The historic artifacts recovered in the shovel testing occur only in four shovel
tests; the density is 3.5 per positive shovel test (see Table 2). Three of the four shovel tests with historic
artifacts are in the far eastern part of the tract, not far west of an historic well (see Figure 21).
The Woodland period occupation is a component of the Mossy Grove culture (Story 1990). Here, the
archeological evidence of that occupation consists of three Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified sandy paste
body sherds from ST 6, ST 9, and ST 23 at the opposite ends of the alluvial landform (see Figure 21).
The principal occupation of the Pike tract took place during prehistoric Caddo times, between ca. A.D.
850-1300 (see Story 2000). It is represented by more than 97% of the ceramic sherds found during the

34

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites

shovel testing, two arrow points, and an unknown amount of the lithic debris and fire-cracked rock (see
Table 2).
The one complete arrow point is an early Caddo style Alba point from ST 24 (0-20 cm) (Figure 22a). It
is made from a non-local translucent gray chert, has a parallel stem, a flat base, and square barbs; the point
is unifacially flaked. It is 25.2 mm in length, 14.0 mm in width, 2.9 mm in thickness, and has a 3.6 mm stem
width. The other arrow point is a bifacially worked medial fragment, also made from a non-local gray chert.

The lithic debris is comprised of a mixture of flakes and chips knapped from both local (54.5%) and
non-local (45.5%) raw material sources. The local lithic debris includes: quartzite (n=27/40.7% cortical),
usually heat-treated; petrified wood (n=21/28.6% cortical); Glover quartzite (4/50% cortical, see Perttula
and Nelson 2006); red chert (n=2/1, 50% cortical, including a core fragment); and brown chert (n=1/0%
cortical). Quartzite and petrified wood account for more than 87% of the lithic debris from the Pike tract
from local raw material sources. Cortical pieces of lithic debris are abundant, accounting for 36.4% of the
local lithic debris, indicating that local lithic raw materials were commonly knapped at an early stage of
reduction, where the cortical surface was removed to obtain flakes for tool manufacture.
The non-local lithic debris sources represent central Texas or deep East Texas raw materials (Manning
fused glass, see Brown 1976), available either collected in gravel bars (including Trinity River gravel bars to the
west) or from outcrops. These are: Manning fused glass (n=2/0% cortical); dark gray chert (n=5/40% cortical);
yellowish-gray chert (n=1/100% cortical); gray chert (n=26/15.4% cortical); grayish-brown chert (3/33%
cortical); brownish-gray chert (n=3/33% cortical); black chert (n=1/0% cortical); light gray chert (n=2/50%
cortical); dark gray-white chert (n=1/0% cortical); grayish-white chert (n=1/0% cortical); and a yellow
chalcedony (n=1/0% cortical). Overall, the gray chert represents more than 56.5% of the non-local lithic debris
in the Pike tract assemblage. Approximately 21.7% of the non-local lithic debris has cortical remnants.
The Caddo ceramic sherds (n=71) include 58 plain sherds (one rim, 53 body sherds, and four base sherds)
and 13 decorated sherds, including three rim sherds. The plain to decorated sherd ratio is 4.46, consistent
with an Early Caddo occupation in this part of East Texas; the sherds identified to type are also consistent
with an occupation of this age (see Story 2000; Suhm and Jelks 1962). The decorated sherds include one fine
ware body sherd with a single straight engraved line, and 12 utility ware sherds from vessels decorated with
punctated (n=5), incised (n=6), and incised-punctated (n=1) decorative elements (see Figure 22b). Four of the
incised sherds have parallel lines, ranging from closely-spaced to widely-spaced in orientation (see Figure
22b, middle), another has diagonal incised lines on a rim (Dunkin Incised), and one rim has horizontal incised
lines (Davis Incised). The final utility ware sherd is a diagonal incised body sherd with a row of linear tool
punctations below the incising, probably at the rim-body juncture (see Figure 22b, left).
The punctated sherds include two Weches Fingernail Impressed sherds, including a rim (see Figure
22b, right), and single examples of sherds with fingernail punctated, linear punctated, or tool punctated
decorative elements.
The limited number of historic artifacts recovered in shovel testing of the Pike tract date no earlier than
1820, and most likely date after ca. 1840. This includes: thin (1.2 mm) aqua-colored window glass in ST 10,
estimated to have been manufactured around ca. A.D. 1823.8 + 7 years (1816-1831) (Moir 1987); two cut
nails from ST 11 and ST 16) (1820-1891, Wells 2000); ca. 1830-1860 refined earthenware sherds from ST
10 and ST 11, including a hand-painted rim sherd (cf. Majewski and O’Brien 1984, 1987; Price 1979); and
a sherd from a clear lead-glazed stoneware vessel in ST 10. This particular kind of stone ware would have
been manufactured and used between the 1830s and ca. 1875 (Greer 1981; Lebo 1987).
In summary, none of the artifacts recovered in shovel testing on the Pike tract at the George C. Davis
site can be associated with the 1806 ranchito plotted in this location by Juan Pedro Walker (see Figure
10). Instead, there is evidence for occupations during the Woodland period (ca. 500 B.C. to A.D. 800), a
substantial residential occupation by prehistoric Caddos between ca. A.D. 850-1300, and then in the early

36

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites

to mid-19th century, probably by an Anglo-American family. They testify to the long-term use of the
landform, and probably to the long-term use of the aboriginal trail that crosses the landform and runs to and
from the Neches River crossing of what became known as El Camino Real de los Tejas.
George A. Moore No. 2 (41HO66)
The George A. Moore No. 2 site (41HO66) is an Historic Caddo site on the Lovell tract located not far
east of an NPS-plotted route and corridor of El Camino Real de los Tejas (see Perttula and Cast 2010:Table
3). Alex Krieger originally recorded the site in 1944 during a reconnaissance survey of the lower reaches
of San Pedro Creek. He recovered a number of brushed sherds as well as a Poynor Engraved sherd; this
type occurs in both Late Caddo and Historic Caddo contexts in this part of the Neches River basin (Perttula
2007a, 2008b; Perttula and Nelson 2006). Krieger did not recover any European trade goods at the George
A. Moore No. 2 site, but a wide variety of European goods documented at other Historic Caddo sites on
the Lovell Tract, including a small cannon at 41HO6, glass beads, gun parts, and ammunition at 41HO64, a
Catlinite pipe at 41HO65, and glass beads from 41HO67 (Perttula 2005:86-87). No archeological evidence
of these other sites was detected during the present archeological survey, despite pedestrian survey, metal
detecting, and shovel testing. The area has been extensively disturbed by feral hogs and harvester ants, and
a large well pad and pipeline now bisects the Lovell tract (Figure 23).
The George A. Moore #2 site is on an upland toe slope (230-250 feet amsl) about 40 m north of the current
channel of San Pedro Creek. The George A. Moore No. 2 site covers an estimated 8000 m2 (ca. 2 acres),
based on the surface distribution of artifacts and the excavation of ST 1-9 on the Lovell tract (see Figure 23
and Appendix 1). Archeological deposits range from 20-60 cm in thickness across the site, and they contain
chipped and ground stone artifacts, plain and decorated body sherds (Table 3), and a few pieces of animal bone
(see Schniebs, below). The density of artifacts in the shovel testing is 4.71 per positive shovel test, or ca. 37.7
artifacts per m2. The highest densities of sherds are in ST 1, 2, and 5, near the tip of the landform, while lithic
artifacts are more abundant in ST 1, 3, 5, and 6, in the same general area (see Figure 23).

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites

The ceramic sherds from the George A. Moore #2 site are primarily from brushed utility ware jars,
although the assemblage of sherds is rather small (n=15). Approximately 86% of the decorated sherds
are brushed (parallel brushed, n=9; opposed brushed, n=3), and 80% of all the sherds from the site are
brushed. The plain/decorated sherd ratio (P/DR) is a very low 0.07. These percentages and P/DR values
are consistent with this being an Historic Caddo (Nabedache Caddo) ceramic assemblage on San Pedro
Creek (Perttula and Nelson 2006, 2007). In other known Historic Caddo sites on San Pedro Creek, P/
DR ratios range from 0.32-0.60, and the percentage of brushed sherds among all sherds is 36.4-56.7%.
Finally, brushed sherds comprise 69.2-76% of all the decorated sherds in the Nabedache Caddo ceramic
assemblages. If the proportion of brushing increases through time, such that sites with the highest
percentage of brushed sherds are the youngest in a group of assemblages, and the P/DR value decreases
from older to youngest, then the George A. Moore #2 site is the youngest of the documented Nabedache
Caddo ceramic assemblages (41HO91, 41HO211, 41HO214, and 41HO263, see below and Perttula and
Nelson 2006, 2007).
The other decorated sherds in the George A. Moore #2 sherd assemblage include a body sherd (ST 1,
0-20 cm bs) with opposed engraved lines (untyped), and a parallel grooved body sherd (ST 2, 0-20 cm)
from a Lindsey Grooved jar. This kind of utility ware is a recently recognized Historic Caddo utility ware in
the Neches-Angelina river basin (Perttula et al. 2010).
Grog, bone, and hematite were used to temper the vessels at the site, either as the sole temper, or in
combination with other tempers. Grog was present in 50% of the analyzed sherds, compared to 50% for
sherds with bone, and 60% with hematite temper inclusions. These are much higher proportions of bone
and temper use than has been documented at other Historic Caddo sites along San Pedro Creek (see Perttula
and Nelson 2006, 2007, see below). A naturally sandy clay was occasionally used to manufacture vessels,
represented by 20% of the sherds from the site analyzed in detail (see Appendix 3).
The sherds are from vessels that were fired and cooled in a high oxygen environment (10%);
incompletely oxidized during firing (40%); fired and cooled in a reducing environment (10%); fired in a
reducing environment and cooled in the open air (30%), and one sherd (10%) from a vessel that was fired
in an irregular way, with a lighter core than their surfaces. Aten and Bollich (2002:54-55) suggest that
vessels with this kind of firing may have been placed in a fire with the “orifice [of the vessel] facing into
the fire.” Furthermore, the sherds with cores lighter than the surfaces may have come from vessels where
“after extended firing that burned off all organics, the fire may have been smothered to cause reduction and
darkening of the exterior surface.” It is interesting that the vessel firing practices apparent in the sherds
found at the George A. Moore #2 site are quite different from other Historic Caddo Nabedache sites, in that
the latter are dominated (68-79%) by sherds fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open air (see
Perttula and Nelson [2006, 2007], and the discussion that follows concerning the ceramic sherds from the
Ivie #1 site on San Pedro Creek).
The lithic artifacts from the site are apparently a product of the manufacture of chipped stone tools
during the Caddo occupation of the site, as there is no evidence of an earlier pre-ceramic Archaic or
Woodland period ceramic-bearing occupation. In addition to the lithic debris, there is a single ferruginous
sandstone grinding slab fragment from ST 5 (20-40 cm bs) (see Table 3). The fragment is at least 76 mm in
length and 46 mm in width.

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites

39

Raw materials represented in the lithic debris assemblage at the George A. Moore #2 site include the
following local materials: petrified wood (n=8/50% cortical), quartzite (n=6/67% cortical, including a
core fragment), and Glover quartzite (n=2/50% cortical, see Perttula and Nelson [2006] for a discussion
concerning this distinctive Neches River basin raw material). These raw materials comprise 69.6% of the
lithic debris from the site. Probable non-local lithic raw materials (most likely from Central Texas source
areas or expansive gravel deposits east of the Edwards Plateau) in the lithic debris are: black-white banded
chert (n=1/0% cortical), translucent gray chert (n=1/0% cortical), and gray chert (n=5/0% cortical). These
much rarer tool stones account for 30.4% of the lithic debris sample.

Faunal Remains, by LeeAnna Schniebs
Six faunal specimens were recovered from two levels in two shovel tests (ST 2, 20-40 cm bs and ST 5,
20-60 cm bs) at the George A. Moore Site (41HO66), and three fragments were collected from the surface
of the site. The collection consists of seven large mammal bone fragments, one deer tooth fragment from ST
2, and a small piece of burned turtle shell from ST 5 (20-40 cm bs). The sample weighs 1.7 grams.
Nabedache Azul Site (41HO214)
Shovel testing in the McLean tract, on the east side of the San Pedro Creek valley and just south of
Mission Tejas State Park, identified Historic Caddo archeological deposits in only one area, despite the
occurrence of alluvial rises, alluvial fan deposits, and other landforms considered to have the potential to
contain Historic Caddo archeological sites. This area is the southernmost part of the Nabedache Azul site
(41HO214), a Historic Nabedache Caddo habitation site (Perttula and Nelson 2006:46-54) that is on Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department lands as well as private property. The site is on a colluvial bench (245-250
feet amsl) (Figure 24).
The shovel tests found two plain bone-tempered Caddo pottery body sherds (5.6-5.9 mm) between 0-20
cm bs in ST 4 and ST 5. These are from two separate vessels fired in a reducing environment and cooled in
the open air.
A metal detector was employed during the archeological survey of the McLean tract; previous
investigations at the Nabedache Azul site recovered 18th century lead balls, lead sprue, an iron guncock, a
brass butt plate finial, cast iron kettle fragments, a brass tinkler, possible hand wrought nails, iron knife blade
fragments, a brass trade kettle piece, a hand-forged iron band, an undecorated cupreous button, and various
iron strips (Perttula and Nelson 2006:94-101). However, our 2010 metal detector investigations only recovered
20th century metal artifacts (from ST 1-8)—such as a cotter pin, barbed wire, an iron plow part, a hitch pin,
and pieces of wire. These are a continuation of a concentration of 20th century metal defined near the Mission
Tejas State Park fence line in Perttula and Nelson’s (2006:Figure 26) work at the Nabedache Azul site.
Ivie #1 Site (41HO263)
The Ivie #1 site was located on a wooded sandy natural alluvial rise (240 feet amsl) along the edge of
the San Pedro Creek floodplain (Figure 25). The current channel of the creek lies a short distance to the
east of the site, and there is also a small tributary to the creek just to the south of the rise. The site has been

damaged by recent well pad construction, but shovel testing on the rise documented intact midden deposits
on the area of the rise, as well as intact archeological deposits in one shovel test (ST 24) that are preserved
underneath (40-80 cm bs) the disturbed well pad fill.
Based on the distribution of Caddo artifacts on the surface, and in seven shovel tests (ST 18-24), the
preserved remnants of the Ivie #1 site cover approximately 3000 m2 (0.75 acres). The archeological deposits
extend to at least 80-100 cm bs. The density of artifacts in the shovel tests—principally lithic debris, charred
nutshells, and Caddo pottery sherds—is considerable, at 27.1 artifacts per positive shovel test, or ca. 216.8
artifacts per m2 (Table 4). The highest densities of artifacts are in ST 22, ST 21, ST 19, and ST 23 at the
southern end of the site (see Figure 25).

The Caddo pottery from the Ivie #1 site (n=88 sherds), including six rims, both plain (Figure 26a-b) and
decorated, five base sherds, and 77 body sherds, is primarily tempered with grog (91.8% of the sherds have
some grog in the paste), but 24.5% of the sherds analyzed in detail (see Appendix 3) also have either burned
bone or hematite temper inclusions in the paste; one sherd also has a notable amount of charred organics
in the paste. The different proportions of temper used in vessel manufacture at the site are consistent with
those from nearby Historic Caddo (Nabedache Caddo) sites at Mission Tejas State Park, with the exception
that the use of crushed hematite temper is about 15% higher at the Ivie #1 site than it is at the Nabedache
Blanco and Nabedache Azul sites (Perttula and Nelson 2006:Figure 37 and Table 3).
The sherds are from vessels that were fired predominantly in a low oxygen or reducing environment
(79.5%), with many of the vessels allowed to cool in the open air, leaving thin oxidized bands along either
one or both vessel surfaces (cf. Teltser 1993). Another 14.3% are from vessels fired in a high oxygen or

oxidizing environment, and 6.1% of the sherds analyzed in detail from the Ivie #1 site are from vessels that
were incompletely oxidized during firing. At the Nabedache Blanco and Nabedache Azul sites, the sherds
are from vessels fired in the same way as those from Ivie #1, namely in a reducing environment (68.477.1%), with much lower proportions of sherds fired in either an oxidizing (7.7-13.0%) or incompletely
oxidizing (12.0-13.4%) environment.
Both the temper and firing conditions data from the Ivie #1 sherds strongly suggest that the ceramics
made and used there derive from the same Nabedache Caddo ceramic tradition more fully documented in
late 17th-mid-18th century sites at nearby Mission Tejas State Park. The decorations on the sherds from
the Ivie #1 site, as well as comparable plain to decorated sherd ratios (P/DR), attest to the use of virtually
the same decorative practices on pottery vessels as had been noted at the nearby historic Nabedache Caddo
sites (Perttula and Nelson 2006, 2007), particularly the heavy use of brushed vessels among the utility wares
(Table 5), and similar proportions for most of the other kinds of utility wares (i.e., incised, punctated, and
neck banded).

Sample sizes: Ivie #1 (33 plain sherds and 55 decorated sherds); 41HO211 (24 plain sherds and 70 decorated sherds);
41HO214 (55 plain sherds and 172 decorated sherds); 41HO91 (22 plain sherds and 39 decorated sherds), see Perttula
and Nelson (2006, 2007).

The only substantial difference between these San Pedro Creek Caddo sites is the absence of Patton
Engraved fine ware sherds at the Ivie #1 site (among the four engraved sherds found there), and its ubiquity
at the Historic Nabedache Caddo sites. If the absence of Patton Engraved at the Ivie #1 site is not simply a
product of decorated sherd sample size, but an accurate reflection that it was not made and used there—and
we take the other measurements of very similar decorative methods into account (see Table 5), this would
suggest that the Caddo occupation at the Ivie #1 site dates just prior to ca. A.D. 1650, perhaps from ca. A.D.
1600-1650. Thus, the site was occupied just prior to the historic use of El Camino Real de los Tejas by the
Caddo and European groups.
The fine ware sherds at the Ivie #1 site include two rim sherds and two body sherds. The first rim has
a series of closely-spaced horizontal to diagonal engraved lines that probably encircle the vessel, while the
second rim has both horizontal and cross-hatched engraved lines on it (Figure 27e). Neither rim sherd, both
from the surface (see Appendix 3), can be identified with a known East Texas Late Caddo or Historic Caddo
ceramic type (see Suhm and Jelks 1962).
The first engraved body sherd has a single curvilinear engraved line. The second body sherd is from a
bottle with a large central element that consists of a circle with crossed lines, with curvilinear engraved lines
apparently encircling this central element (Figure 28). This bottle sherd may be from a Poynor Engraved

vessel (see Kleinschmidt 1982:Figures 19 and 20). The Poynor Engraved type is principally found in Late
Caddo (ca. A.D. 1400-1650) contexts in the Neches River basin, but has been found occasionally in Historic
Caddo burial features in the region (Kleinschmidt 1982:Table 19; Perttula 2007b:Table 1).
Utility wares (n=51) from the Ivie #1 site are dominated by brushed body sherds (n=27) from Bullard
Brushed cooking and storage jars. These include 20 body sherds with parallel (or vertically oriented)
brushing (see Figure 27c-d), five with opposed brushing marks, one with overlapping brushing, and one
with vertical brushing.
Five other sherds have brushed and punctated decorations. This includes rim and body sherds (n=4)
with parallel brushing marks that have either rows of circular (Figure 29c) or tool punctates pushed through
the brushing, a body sherd with parallel brushing adjacent to a row of tool punctates.
There are eight sherds from an undefined type or types decorated with punctations. Several (n=4) have
rows of tool punctations or rows of fingernail punctations (n=1), one has alternate rows of crescent-shaped
punctations (see Figure 29d), a rim has rows of circular punctations (see Figure 29b), and one has only a
single punctation on a body sherd.

One of the seven incised body sherds collected from the surface or in the shovel testing of the Ivie #1
site may be from a Maydelle Incised jar. It has a series of broad opposed diagonal incised lines (see Figure
27b). Other decorative elements represented in the incised sherds that may also be from Maydelle Incised
vessels include parallel incised lines (n=2), opposed incised lines (n=2, see Figure 27a), and body sherds
with a single straight incised line (n=2).
There are two body sherds with incised-punctated decorations in the Ivie #1 sherd assemblage. The first
of these has opposed incised lines that are intersected by a row of tool punctations, while the second body
sherd has a single straight incised line adjacent to a zone of tool punctations. The two neck banded sherds
(see Figure 29a) are from La Rue Neck Banded jars that have horizontal crimped or neck banded rows on
the vessel rim.
The lithic debris from the Ivie #1 site attests to the manufacture of chipped stone tools during the
Caddo occupation of the site, as there is no evidence of an earlier pre-ceramic Archaic or Woodland period
ceramic-bearing occupation. In addition to lithic debris, there are three small pieces of fire-cracked rock
from three of the shovel tests (see Table 4).
Consistent with both a Late Caddo as well as an Historic Caddo occupation in the Neches-Angelina
river basin, a single Perdiz arrow point was documented from ST 18 (20-40 cm bs) at the Ivie #1 site. This
point is made from a local petrified wood, has been unifacially flaked to shape, and has slightly downwardpointing barbs (Figure 30). It is 19.6 mm in length, 13.8 mm in width, 2.5 mm thickness, and has a 5.4 mm
stem width.
Raw materials represented in the lithic debris assemblage include the following local materials:
petrified wood (n=26), quartzite (n=28), Glover quartzite (n=76, see Perttula and Nelson [2006] for a
discussion concerning this distinctive Neches River basin raw material), ferruginous sandstone (n=1), and

Figure 30. Perdiz arrow point from the Ivie #1 site (41HO263).

48

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites

red chert (n=3). These raw materials comprise 90.5% of the lithic debris from the Ivie #1 site. Probable nonlocal lithic raw materials (most likely from Central Texas source areas or expansive gravel deposits east of
the Edwards Plateau) in the lithic debris are: light gray chert (n=4), translucent gray chert (n=1), gray chert
(n=4), grayish-brown chert (n=2), white chert (n=1), and yellowish-gray chert (n=2). These much rarer tool
stones account for 9.5% of the lithic debris sample.
Charred hickory nutshells (n=21) and wood charcoal (n=11) are relatively common in the archeological
deposits at the Ivie #1 site, due to the enhanced preservation conditions found in the midden deposits. Their
presence also suggests that there may be pit features or other areas of concentrated charred organic remains
at the site.
Faunal Remains, by LeeAnna Schniebs
Shovel testing at the Ivie #1 site yielded 22 faunal specimens (Table 6). They were recovered from five
levels in six shovel tests. The sample is comprised of indeterminate vertebrate, deer, and large mammal
remains, with a combined weight of 9.7 grams. Eleven pieces are burned.

The bones are highly fragmented, preventing specific identification in most cases; deer (Odocoileus
virginianus) is the only identifiable animal. Few interpretations can be made except that the Caddo
supplemented their diet by hunting, and that deer was the primary meat source; they were hunted in the
wooded edges of East Texas. The presence of cranial elements (antler, tooth fragments, petrous) and leg bones
(metapodial and maleolus) suggests that the bones came from a kill site. Often the animal was killed and
butchered/processed at one location, and the meatier parts of the animal were taken back to another area for

preparation, cooking, and consumption. Further investigations at the site would provide more information as
to the subsistence practices of the Late Caddo populations that lived in the upper Neches River basin, and also
provide a point of contrast with the use and hunting of game animals on Historic Caddo sites.
David King Site (41NA321)
The David King site is an Historic Caddo Allen phase site situated on an alluvial fan (ca. 285-290 feet
amsl) about 200 m west of King Creek, southward-flowing tributary to the Angelina River. The site was
first identified and recorded by Tom Middlebrook and Morris Jackson in February 2009. At that time, and
over a one week period, Middlebrook and Jackson obtained a surface collection from the site, excavated
three shovel tests (ST 1-3), and excavated a single 1 x 1 m unit (Unit 1) near the apparent center of the site,
or at least in the area of the site with a high density of Historic Caddo ceramics on the surface and in initial
shovel testing. The site was in an improved pasture when it was investigated by Middlebrook and Jackson,
as well as during our January 2010 investigations (Figure 31), but there were many gopher mounds scattered
across the landform, a number of which had visible Caddo pottery sherds.

Figure 31. Looking north at the David King site. The King Creek floodplain is to the right in the woods.
In our 2010 investigations, we first excavated 19 additional shovel tests at the David King site
(including ST 23 on the gravelly hill to the northwest a short distance), primarily to better determine
the horizontal and vertical extent of the archeological deposits (Figure 32), but also to define the spatial
distribution and density of material culture remains at this Historic Caddo habitation site. A return visit
to the site, and the excavation of six additional shovel tests (Figure 33), led to an expansion of the David
King site area across an alluvial terrace (280-290 feet amsl) north and east of the alluvial fan. Based on the
distribution of artifacts from surface contexts as well as the recovery of artifacts from the 21 positive shovel

tests (Table 7) in the main part of the site as well as the northern extension, the David King site covers an
area of ca. 22,000 m2 (5.4 acres) and has archeological deposits that are a maximum of 50 cm in depth.

The density of artifacts in the shovel tests ranges from 1-24 artifacts per positive shovel test (see Table
7), with the highest densities (16-24 artifacts per positive shovel test) in ST 5, 7, 13, and 20 (Figure 34), as
well as in ST 32 in the northern extension. The mean density of artifacts (not including animal bone) is 9.73
per positive shovel test in the main part of the site, or ca. 77.8 artifacts per m2, and 8.3 artifacts per positive
shovel test in the northern part of the site (ca. 66.4 artifacts per m2). The area with the highest densities of
sherds, and slightly darker organically-enriched soils, covers about 50 x 30 m in the northern part of the
main site area.
Of the 226 artifacts recovered in the recent shovel testing and surface collections at the David King site,
more than 92% are plain and decorated pottery vessel sherds. There are also chipped and ground stone tools
(n=2, 1.3%), lithic debris (n=10, 4.4%), an unidentified piece of metal in ST 5 that may be a fragment of
a forged nail head (Figure 35), and a small amount of preserved wood charcoal (n=2) and charred nutshell
(n=1) in two shovel tests (see Table 7).
The pottery sherds are divided into plain (n=55) and decorated (n=154) sherds; the P/DR for the site as
a whole is a low 0.36 value, consistent with ceramic assemblages on Historic Caddo sites in the Angelina
River basin (cf. Story 1995; Middlebrook 2007; Perttula et al. 2010). The P/DR on the main part of the
site is 0.27, compared to 0.61 in the northern extension area. This suggests that the main part of the site
may be slightly younger in age than the northern extension, since increasingly lower P.DR values have
chronological implications, with the lowest P/DR ratios occurring in Historic Caddo ceramic assemblages.
The plain sherds include one rim, 52 body sherds, and two base sherds. The decorated sherds are
represented by 11 rims and 143 body sherds (Table 8). The fine wares—sherds from vessels decorated with
engraving and/or red-slipping—comprise 13.6% of the sample of decorated sherds from the David King site,
and the utility wares account for 86.4% of the sample. The majority of the sherds from the site are from vessels
with brushed decorations (as the sole decoration, or in combination with other decorative elements), as these
account for 68.8% of all the decorated sherds as well as 50.7% of all the sherds in the documented sample.

The fine ware sherds (n=21) from the David King site include six sherds from Patton Engraved bowls
or carinated bowls (Figures 36 and 37, top). These include sherds with parallel or straight lines (likely
horizontal in orientation on the rim, see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 59a-b, d-k) with small triangular tick
marks on them (n=3, Figure 34a-b), and two sherds with curvilinear engraved lines with small triangular
tick marks (n=1, Figure 36c and Figure 37). The latter compares favorably with Patton Engraved, var.
Patton (Perttula 2008b:Figure 2), and the sherd with parallel engraved ticked lines is probably from a Patton
Engraved, var. Allen vessel.

The other engraved sherds from the site do not have tick marks on them, and they may be from
currently undefined or unidentifiable fine ware types in the Angelina River basin locale or from those
portions of Patton Engraved vessels that do not have ticked lines (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 59b, d,
h-i, k-l). They include sherds with parallel engraved lines (n=4, among them one sherd with spurred lines),
single straight lines (n=4), opposed engraved lines (n=1), a hatched zone (n=1), and several with curvilinear
lines (n=3). A sherd from the surface has a cross-hatched engraved zone, and this may be an example of
King Engraved, a new Historic Caddo type in the Angelina River basin (Perttula et al. 2010). One fine ware
sherd has a straight excised line on the exterior surface, and the interior surface is red-slipped.
The brushed sherds from the site are represented by parallel (likely oriented vertically on the vessel
body) brushed (n=92, Figure 38b-d; see also Figure 37, bottom row, left), opposed (n=1), and overlapping
brushed (n=2) body sherds and horizontal brushed rims (n=2). The rims are from Bullard Brushed jars, and
it is likely that most of the brushed body sherds are also from jars of this type.
Five body sherds and one rim sherd from the David King site have brushed-incised decorations. One
other body sherd has parallel brushing marks with large circular punctations pushed through the brushing, a
rim sherd has a straight appliqued filet below the lip, and above horizontal brushing on the rim (see Figure
37, bottom row, right), and the last brushed sherd from the site has parallel brushing adjacent to a straight

appliqued fillet. Similar decorative combinations are apparent on Bullard Brushed jars from Caddo sites in
the Neches-Angelina river basin (e.g., Suhm and Jelks 1962:21).
The incised rim and body sherds (n=10) in the ceramic assemblage have simple geometric decorations,
characteristic of the Maydelle Incised type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 52), including parallel lines (n=3),
vertical lines (n=1), and diagonal lines (n=1). Five other body sherds have only a single straight incised line
on them. Punctated sherds are represented by body and rim sherds with a single tool punctate (n=6); a rim
with a row of tool punctates under the vessel lip; another rim with large circular punctations on it; a body
sherd with a row of tool punctates; and another rim with vertically oriented linear punctates below the vessel
lip. The three incised-punctated body sherds in the collection have straight or parallel incised lines adjacent
to a row (or more) of tool punctations (see Figure 38a).
The remaining utility wares at the David King site include two body sherds with either a straight
appliqued ridge or appliqued fillet on them, a horizontal grooved (Lindsey Grooved) rim, and a parallel
grooved body.
During Middlebrook’s investigations at the David King site in 2009, a large sample of plain and
decorated sherds (n=416) was obtained from surface collections, shovel testing, and the excavation of
Unit 1. In combination with the ceramic sherds from the 2010 work, which obtained a smaller sample
of 209 sherds, the summary information on the decorative methods represented in the combining of the
two collections provides a broader and representative sample of the relative importance of the different
decorative methods among the abundant ceramic sherds recovered at the site (Table 9).

The combined 2009/2010 ceramic sample of decorated sherds indicates that more than 88% are from
utility wares, and 11.7% are from engraved fine wares. The P/DR is a low 0.20. Of the utility wares,
sherds with brushing marks comprise 78.2% of all the decorated sherds (most, if not all from Bullard
Brushed vessels), and 66.1% of all the sherds from the David King site (see Table 9). Less important
utility wares have incised or punctated decorative elements, and these are from Maydelle Incised jars and/
or typologically undefined rim punctated jars. Other utility ware types in the assemblage include Lindsey
Grooved and La Rue Neck Banded. The fine wares are dominated by rim and body sherds from Patton
Engraved vessels, and about 6.5% of the fine wares are from King Engraved vessels, a new ceramic type
characterized by cross-hatched zones on rim panels.
Based on a detailed analysis of a sample (29%) of the ceramics from the David King site are from vessels
tempered with grog. This detailed analysis of 62 sherds (see Appendix 3) indicates that 93.6% of them have
grog as a temper (either as the sole temper, or in combination with other temper additives). Almost 33% of
the sherds also have crushed pieces of hematite temper added to the paste, and another 19.4% have burned
bone temper; the proportion of vessel sherds with bone temper is much higher in the northern extension area
(36%) than is the case in the main site area (8.1%). The proportions of bone and grog temper in the ceramic
assemblage at the David King site are comparable to the temper uses documented in the ceramics at two
other Historic Caddo sites in Nacogdoches County—Henry M. and Deshazo—in the Bayou Loco drainage
not far to the south: 83-90.4% grog temper and 9.2-17% bone temper (Perttula 2009:Table 2). At the Spradley
site (41NA206), however, another Historic Caddo site, but located to the southeast in the Bayou La Nana
drainage, bone-tempered pottery comprises 40.3% of the sherds.

60

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites

The David King sherds are from vessels fired in a variety of different ways (see Appendix 3). Firing
conditions indicate that 19.4% of the sherds are from vessels that were fired and cooled in a high oxygen
environment; 11.3% are from incompletely oxidized vessels; 66.1% are from vessels that were fired in a low
oxygen or reducing environment, and then allowed either to cool in the fire (12.9%), or to cool in the open
air (53.2%); and 3.2% are from vessels that were fired in an irregular way, with a lighter core than their
surfaces. Aten and Bollich (2002:54-55) suggest that vessels with this kind of firing may have been placed
in a fire with the “orifice [of the vessel] facing into the fire.” Furthermore, the sherds with cores lighter than
the surfaces may have come from vessels where “after extended firing that burned off all organics, the fire
may have been smothered to cause reduction and darkening of the exterior surface.”
The lithic tools documented at the David King site during the 2010 investigations include a Perdiz
arrow point and a pitted stone fragment. The Perdiz point, made of a local petrified wood, has been
bifacially flaked to shape the point, has serrated blades, a long pointed contracting stem and a rounded base,
as well as downward-pointing barbs (Figure 39). The point is 21.2 mm in length, 14.0 mm in width, 3.4 mm
thick, and has a 3.8 mm stem width. The ferruginous sandstone pitted stone fragment (ST 21, 20-40 cm bs)
has a single 36 mm diameter pit on one surface of the tool.

Figure 39. Perdiz point from ST 5 (20-40 cm bs) at the David King site.
The small amount of lithic debris from the site is dominated by pieces of petrified wood n=6, 60%). One
of the petrified wood lithic debris has a stream-polished cortex, suggesting it was chipped from a piece of
petrified wood gathered in a King Creek gravel bed. The other four pieces of lithic debris are from non-local
sources—most likely from Central Texas sources based on their appearance and color—and they include
single non-cortical specimens of dark gray-white chert, grayish-black chert, a dark gray chert, and gray chert.
The one remaining artifact recovered from the David King site during the 2010 shovel testing is a small,
eroded, and rusted piece of iron from ST 5 (20-40 cm bs). A most optimistic appraisal of this small metal

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites

61

artifact is that it is a possible nail head and partial shank, though it is impossible to determine if it is a forged
or post-1820 machine cut nail.
Faunal Remains, by LeeAnna Schniebs
Six faunal specimens were recovered from the David King site. These small unidentifiable bone
fragments came from two levels in Shovel Test 13. Five pieces were from the first level (0-20 cm bs), and
one fragment was found in the second level (20-40 cm bs). These are probably large mammal remains, most
likely from deer. All of the specimens are burned, and the total sample weighs 0.5 grams.
Wes Wisener Site (41NA336)
The Wes Wisener site is an Historic Caddo, Allen phase, site on an alluvial terrace landform (280290 feet amsl) above the west bank of King Creek. The site is primarily in a well-maintained pasture with
several patches of artifacts exposed in disked areas across the landform. Surface collections and intensive
shovel testing (n=21, ST 37-57, see Figure 33) defined a site area of approximately 20,500 m2, or 5 acres.
The site has 40-50 cm thick archeological deposits buried in Attoyac fine sandy loam alluvial deposits (see
Dolezel 1980:15).
A total of 350 artifacts were documented from surface collections (including surface collections obtained
by Tom Middlebrook and Morris Jackson) and shovel testing at the Wes Wisener site (Table 10). The
majority of the documented artifacts are plain and decorated sherds from Caddo vessels (77.8%), followed by
lithic debris (19%), chipped and ground stone tools (2.9%), and one European glass trade bead (0.3%).

Nineteen of 21 shovel tests at the site had Historic Caddo archeological material remains (see Table 10).
The density of artifacts in the shovel testing is 7.3 artifacts per positive shovel test (ca. 58 artifacts per m2),
with a range of 1-18 per shovel test. There are concentrations of artifacts in three areas at the site: ST 37 at
the northern end of the landform; ST 39, ca. 25 m to the south; and the largest cluster in the middle part of
the site, and including ST 40-45. At its northern end, this area is about 95 m south of ST 39 (see Figure 33).
They may represent discrete habitation areas, and/or the location of Historic Caddo houses and trash deposits.
The pottery sherds from the Wes Wisener site are divided into plain (n=74) and decorated (n=198)
sherds; the P/DR for the site is a low 0.37 value, consistent with ceramic assemblages on Historic Caddo
sites in the Angelina River basin (cf. Story 1995; Middlebrook 2007; Perttula et al. 2010).
The plain sherds include one rim, 71 body sherds, and two base sherds. The decorated sherds are
represented by four rims and 194 body sherds (Table 11). The fine wares—sherds from vessels decorated
with engraving and/or red-slipping—comprise 16.2% of the sample of decorated sherds from the Wes
Wisener site, and the utility wares account for 83.8% of the sample. The majority of the sherds from the site
are from vessels with brushed decorations (as the sole decoration, or in combination with other decorative
elements), as these account for 76.8% of all the decorated sherds as well as 55.9% of all the sherds in the
documented sample.
The fine ware sherds (n=32) from the Wes Wisener site include 15 sherds from Patton Engraved bowls
or carinated bowls (Figure 40a). These include sherds with parallel or straight lines (likely horizontal in
orientation on the rim, see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 59a-b, d-k) with small triangular (n=12), linear (n=2),
or oval (n=1) tick marks on them, sherds with both horizontal and diagonal ticked lines (Figure 40a), and
sherds with curvilinear engraved lines with small triangular tick marks (Figure 40a). The latter compares
favorably with Patton Engraved, var. Patton (Perttula 2008b:Figure 2), and the sherd with parallel engraved
ticked lines is probably from a Patton Engraved, var. Allen vessel.

The other engraved sherds from the site do not have tick marks on them, and they may be from
currently undefined or unidentifiable fine ware types in the Angelina River basin locale or from those
portions of Patton Engraved vessels that do not have ticked lines (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 59b, d, h-i,
k-l). They include sherds with parallel engraved lines (n=2), single straight lines (n=8), opposed engraved
lines (n=3), horizontal engraved lines (n=1, perhaps from a Hood Engraved effigy bowl), and several with
curvilinear or parallel-curvilinear lines (n=3, see Figure 40a).
The brushed sherds from the Wes Wisener site are represented by parallel (likely oriented vertically
on the vessel body) brushed marks (n=145, see Figure 40b), overlapping brushed (n=1) body sherds and
horizontal brushed rims and body sherds (n=2). The rims are from Bullard Brushed jars, and it is likely that
most of the brushed body sherds are also from jars of this type.
Two body sherds from the Wes Wisener site have brushed-incised decorations. One other body sherd
has parallel brushing marks with tool punctations pushed through the brushing, and a second body sherd has
vertical brushing with large crescent-shaped punctations pushed through the brushing. Similar decorative
combinations are apparent on Bullard Brushed jars from Caddo sites in the Neches-Angelina river basin
(e.g., Suhm and Jelks 1962:21).
The incised body sherds (n=6) in the ceramic assemblage have simple geometric decorations,
characteristic of the Maydelle Incised type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 52), including parallel lines (n=4),
opposed lines (n=1, see Figure 40b), and a single straight line (n=1). Punctated sherds (n=6) are represented
by body sherds with at least one row of tool punctates on their exterior surface. The one incised-punctated
sherd, a rim, in the collection has a single horizontal incised line on it, with a row of tool punctations
between the horizontal incised line and the vessel lip.

The remaining utility ware sherd at the Wes Wisener site is a body sherd with a straight appliqued ridge
on it.
The David King and Wes Wisener decorated sherd assemblages are very much the same, suggesting
the ceramic vessels made at the two nearby sites are part of the same ceramic tradition, and surely the
occupations are not separated by much time. The P/DR value suggest that the Wes Wisener site may be a
slightly older Historic Caddo occupation, but the 2010 shovel testing at the David King site produced a
nearly identical (0.36) P/DR value (see Table 9). The fine wares are dominated by rim and body sherds from
Patton Engraved vessels. Of the utility wares at both sites, sherds with brushing marks comprise 76.8-78.2%
of all the decorated sherds (most, if not all from Bullard Brushed vessels), and 55.9-66.1% of all the sherds
from the two sites (Table 12). Less important utility wares have incised or punctated decorative elements,
and these are from Maydelle Incised jars and/or typologically undefined rim punctated jars. Other utility
ware types in both assemblages have appliqued decorative elements.

Based on a detailed analysis of a sample (24%) of the ceramics from the Wes Wisener site are from
vessels tempered with grog. This detailed analysis of 65 sherds (see Appendix 3) indicates that 96.9%
of them have grog as a temper (either as the sole temper, or in combination with other temper additives).
Twenty percent of the sherds also have crushed pieces of hematite temper added to the paste, and another
6.2% have burned bone temper. Almost 37% of the sherds are from vessels made with a sandy clay. The
proportions of bone and grog temper in the ceramic assemblage at the Wes Wisener site are comparable to
the temper uses documented in the ceramics at two other Historic Caddo sites in Nacogdoches County—
Henry M. and Deshazo—in the Bayou Loco drainage not far to the south: 83-90.4% grog temper and 9.217% bone temper (Perttula 2009:Table 2), although the proportion of grog temper is slightly higher at the
Wes Wisener site. The nearby David King site (see above) and the J. T. King site (see Walker and Perttula
2010:Table 11) also have a higher proportion of grog-tempered sherds in the assemblage, but unlike Wes
Wisener, the potters there used bone and/or hematite tempers much more frequently. By contrast to the
Bayou Loco and King Creek Historic Caddo sites, at the Spradley site (41NA206), another Historic Caddo
site, but located to the southeast in the Bayou La Nana drainage, bone-tempered pottery comprises 40.3%
of the sherds.
The Wes Wisener sherds are from vessels fired in a variety of different ways (see Appendix 3). Firing
conditions indicate that 12.3% of the sherds are from vessels that were fired and cooled in a high oxygen
environment; 9.2% are from incompletely oxidized vessels; 77% are from vessels that were fired in a low
oxygen or reducing environment, and then allowed either to cool in the fire (18.3%), or to cool in the open
air (58.7%); and 1.5% are from vessels that were fired in an irregular way, with a lighter core than their
surfaces. Aten and Bollich (2002:54-55) suggest that vessels with this kind of firing may have been placed
in a fire with the “orifice [of the vessel] facing into the fire.” Furthermore, the sherds with cores lighter than
the surfaces may have come from vessels where “after extended firing that burned off all organics, the fire
may have been smothered to cause reduction and darkening of the exterior surface.”
Two projectile points were documented from surface contexts at the Wes Wisener site. The first is a Late
Paleoindian lanceolate fragment made from a non-local dark gray chert with quartz inclusions (Figure 41,
left). The point has a shallow concave base, with a small fluting scar on only one face, and edge and stem
grinding. It is a maximum of 21.1 mm in width, and 7.4 mm in thickness. The second point is a bifacially

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites

67

Figure 41. Projectile points from surface contexts at the Wes Wisener site.

chipped Alba arrow point (made between ca. A.D. 850-1300 in East Texas) with a parallel stem and small
barbs (Figure 41, right). The Alba point is made from a local petrified wood; it is 21.2+ mm in length, 10.0
mm in width, 3.9 mm in thickness, and it has a 5.6 mm stem width.
There are five ground stone tools or tool fragments in the Wes Wisener artifact assemblage (see
Table 10). These include a ferruginous sandstone grinding slab fragment (18.6 mm thick) and a quartzitic
sandstone celt fragment from surface contexts. The celt fragment has been pecked and polished near the poll
end of the tool. Ground stone tools from shovel tests include a metamorphic rock fragment (likely from the
Ouachita Mountains in southeastern Oklahoma) from ST 37 (20-40 cm bs); a flat hematite pigment stone
fragment (23+ mm in length, 28 mm in width, and 25 mm in thickness) from ST 37 (20-40 cm bs); and a
2-sided mano and pitted stone (one pit, 19 mm in diameter and 1 mm deep) of ferruginous sandstone from
ST 55 (30 cm bs). This mano-pitted stone is 98 mm in length, 76 mm in width, and 39 mm in thickness.
A small petrified wood biface fragment was recovered from ST 37 (20-40 cm bs). It has one finished or
retouched edge, and may have been used as a knife or cutting tool; it is 28.0 mm in width and 5.0 mm thick.
Three flake tools made on non-local chert raw materials are also in the Wes Wisener artifact assemblage,
all found in surface contexts. Two are expedient tools with unilateral or bilateral retouching/use wear (light
gray and white chert), while the third is a small end scraper made from a dark gray chert.
Lithic debris is relatively abundant at the Wes Wisener site, certainly by comparison with the nearby
David King site, suggesting that on-site tool manufacture and/or maintenance knapping were an important
activity at the time of the Historic Caddo occupation (as well as during earlier periods, prior to A.D. 1300).

Local lithic raw materials included in the lithic debris are: petrified wood (n=19/31.6% cortical), quartzite
(n=6/67% cortical), red chert (n=2/50% cortical), and a brownish-yellow chert (n=1/100% cortical).
These material comprise 42% of the lithic debris sample from the site. More than 42% of the local lithic
debris has cortical remnants, compared to less than 3% of the non-local lithic debris, indicating significant
differences in knapping strategies for these two classes of lithic raw material. The non-local lithic debris
must have been knapped off of completed tools, probably during resharpening and tool maintenance
activities. The local lithic debris is more a product of the earlier stages of pebble reduction, designed to
remove the pebble cortex, and produce useable flakes for arrow points and flake tools.
There are non-local lithic raw materials also represented in the lithic debris: gray chert (n=14/0%
cortical), light gray chert (n=9/0% cortical), dark gray chert (n=4/0% cortical, including two pieces with
bluish inclusions), white chert (n=7/0% cortical), brownish-gray chert (n=2/0% cortical), yellowish-gray
chert (n=1/100% cortical), and reddish-gray chert (n=1/0% cortical). The non-local lithic debris at the
Wes Wisener site accounts for 58% of the lithic debris sample. The proportion of non-local lithic debris at
the nearby J. T. King site is 59% (Walker and Perttula 2010:Table 23), and it is 61% at the Henry M. site
(Perttula et al. 2010).
The one European trade good at the Wes Wisener site is a round, opaque white glass bead (IIa13 in
Kidd and Kidd [1970:70 and Table 2]) found on the site surface in the vicinity of ST 42 (see Figure 33).
The bead is large, with an 8.0 mm diameter (Figure 42). This type of bead is popular on 18th century Caddo
sites in the Neches-Angelina river basin in East Texas. For example, it comprised about 17% of the large
(n=7646) glass bead assemblage from 41HO64, the Nabedache Caddo site on the lower course of San Pedro
Creek (Perttula 2005).

Faunal remains, by LeeAnna Schniebs
Surface collections and shovel testing at the Wes Wisener site (41NA336) yielded 17 bone
fragments. Nine specimens were recovered from surface collection, and the remainder of the faunal
remains came from five shovel tests in two different areas of the site (see Figure 31). The sample from the
site is comprised of six indeterminate vertebrate, nine large mammal, and two deer bone fragments (Table
13). Six pieces are burned, and the collection weighs 3.6 grams.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC (Austin and Pittsburg, Texas) has conducted
archeological survey field work efforts (including pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and metal detecting)
to identify 17th-early 19th Century Caddo sites along El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail in
East Texas. This work was done under a 2009 Challenge Cost Share Program contract with the National Park
Service.
During the course of the project, we were able to obtain landowner permission to conduct archeological
survey work on five tracts of land along and adjacent to the National Park Service (NPS)-plotted El Camino
de los Tejas route:
•

Pike Tract (Cherokee County; survey done under an Antiquities Permit, because the land of interest
is owned by the State of Texas as Caddo Mounds State Historic Site; the archeological survey
results are summarized here and in a stand-alone Antiquities Permit report, Perttula and Nelson
2010);

•

Area 15A on San Pedro Creek (Mr. Ivie and Weinert landowners, Houston County);

•

McLean Tract on San Pedro Creek (Mr. McLean landowner, Houston County);

•

Lovell Tract on San Pedro Creek (Mr. Lovell landowner, Houston County); and

•

King Tract on King Creek (Mr. David King landowner, Nacogdoches County.

We were unable to obtain landowner permission to access the other tracts proposed for survey in our 2009
Research Design submitted to the NPS.
The archeological survey work began in November 2009, and ended on March 14, 2010. We completed
for each of the tracts pedestrian archeological survey, shovel testing (n=201) on key landforms, and
conducted metal detecting work on those same landforms. The archeological survey work identified a total
of 12 archeological sites in the five survey tracts:
•

George C. Davis (41CE19) (Pike Tract);

•

41HO262-41HO265 (Area 15A);

•

Nabedache Azul (41HO214) (McLean Tract);

•

George A. Moore #2 (41HO66), Gary Lovell #1 (41HO266), and Gary Lovell #2 (41HO267; Lovell
Tract); and

•

David King (41NA321), Wes Wisener (41NA336), and M. L. Wisener (41NA337) (King Tract).

The archeological materials (ceramic sherds and chipped stone tools) documented from these 12 sites
testify that they were occupied as early as the Late Paleoindian period (ca. 10,500-10,000 years B.P.) to as
late as the early 18th century by Historic Caddo peoples (including the Nabedache Caddo and the Hainai
Caddo), during the European use of El Camino Real de los Tejas. Of the eight Caddo ceramic-bearing sites
investigated during this project, probably all domestic habitation sites, 41CE19 (George C. Davis) has a
Formative to Early Caddo component (ca. A.D. 850-1200)—thus being occupied during the aboriginal use
of the trail; 41HO263 (Ivie #1) and 41HO264 (Ivie #2) were occupied during the 17th century, but probably
before sustained European contact; while George A. Moore #2 (41HO66), Nabedache Azul (41HO214),
David King (41NA321), Wes Wisener (41NA336), and M. L. Wisener (41NA337) were occupied from
the late 17th century to at least the early 18th century. Historic artifacts recovered at the George C. Davis
site (41CE19) on the Pike Tract indicate that there was a ca. 1820-1860 Anglo-American settlement in
proximity to an old route of the Camino Real, now known as Weeping Mary Road.
European trade goods found at the sites during the 2009-2010 archeological survey investigations
include a possible forged nail from the David King site (41NA321) and a white glass bead from the Wes
Wisener site (41NA336). Previous investigations at the Nabedache Azul site (41HO214) (on Mission Tejas
State Park lands, see Perttula and Nelson 2006) had recovered a variety of glass beads, gun flints, and metal
artifacts (including gun parts) from metal detecting and controlled hand excavations.
During the shovel test investigations, pieces of animal bone were recovered from the George A. Moore
#2 (41HO66), Ivie #1 (41HO263), David King (41NA321), Wes Wisener (41NA336), and M. L. Wisener
(41NA337) sites; charred plant remains were also found. The recovery of preserved animal and plant

remains, as well as the identification of preserved midden deposits at the Ivie #1 (41HO263), David King
(41NA321), and Wes Wisener (41NA336) sites, indicates that there are well-preserved Caddo archeological
deposits of 17th century to early 18th century age at a number of the sites we have studied in this project
along El Camino Real de los Tejas. Certainly we can expect that such sites will have evidence of houses,
outdoor activity areas, arbors/ramadas and granaries, and trash disposal areas. As such, the results of this
archeological survey, in conjunction with more detailed future studies (i.e., remote sensing and selective
hand excavations) of these sites—or others yet to be located along the Camino Real de los Tejas route in
East Texas—can provide a clear glimpse of the nature and character of Caddo lifeways during the European
use of El Camino Real de los Tejas.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK
It is important to understand the role of the Caddo in establishing and living along El Camino Real de
los Tejas (once an aboriginal trail), and in their interacting with European and Anglo-American explorers,
colonists, and settlers that came into their traditional East Texas homelands, as part of a better appreciation
of the historical significance of the trail. Consequently, it is a prerequisite that the location and distribution
of historic (i.e., post-1680 to ca. late 1830s) Caddo Indian sites relative to the known routes of El Camino
Real de los Tejas—and relative to key European and Anglo-American settlements, missions, river crossings,
etc.—be established with confidence. The archeological investigations discussed in this report represent a
first step in that effort, but the archeological survey effort should be continued this year, and next, along the
various plotted routes of El Camino Real de los Tejas as it crosses East Texas, the traditional homelands of
the Caddo Indian peoples.
Foremost in that continuing archeological survey effort sponsored by the NPS would be to complete
archeological survey investigations of Historic Caddo sites on the various archeological survey tracts that
we were unable to gain landowner permission for on this project, including Legg Creek and the Angelina
(see Figure 8); the lower course of Beans Creek (see Figures 11-12); the Neches River below the mouth
of San Pedro Creek (see Figure 14); various San Pedro Creek tracts (see Figures 15-17); and Grass House
Prairie tracts on the middle reaches of San Pedro Creek (see Figures 18-19). Other key tracts that would
warrant continued NPS-sponsored archeological survey efforts to identify Caddo Indian sites occupied
during the European and Anglo-American use of El Camino Real de los Tejas are the tracts identified by
Cast and Perttula (2010:Table 8 and Figures 27 and A1-39).
Beyond archeological survey efforts to identify Historic Caddo sites that are in proximity to the NPSplotted routes of El Camino Real de los Tejas, certain Historic Caddo sites along the route may warrant
more intensive investigations (i.e., hand excavations in selected areas, such as within a Caddo structure,
geophysical survey) to acquire key information on the archeological character of these sites that can be
communicated to the interested public, the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, and the professional archeological
and historical community. These would be sites like J. T. King (41NA15) (see Walker et al. 2009; Walker
and Perttula 2010) that have readily interpretable archeological features and deposits, and have an
archeological story that can be told.
Finally, the NPS should consider developing and installing interpretive signs or kiosks along the plotted
routes of El Camino Real de los Tejas at selected locations along the route in East Texas where important
clusters of Historic Caddo sites are known. These signs or kiosks can tell the archeological and historical

72

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites

story of the Caddo Indian peoples in East Texas, one highway stop at a time. One such area would be along
Highway 21 at King Creek in Nacogdoches County—where sites such as J. T. King (41NA15), David
King (41NA321), and Wes Wisener (41NA336) mark part of an Historic Caddo community that stretched
for more than a mile along the creek, and where two El Camino-plotted routes crossed the area—or along
Highway 21 where it parallels San Pedro Creek in Houston County. There is abundant archeological
evidence of Historic Nabedache Caddo habitation sites (see Perttula 2005; Perttula and Nelson 2006, 2007)
in this locality. We are sure there are more clusters of Historic Caddo sites like these dispersed across East
Texas in proximity to El Camino Real de los Tejas-plotted routes, and they are just waiting to be discovered
and brought to the attention of the interested public, the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the professional
archeological and historical community, and the cities, towns, and historical associations within East Texas
itself.

END NOTES
1. This particular piece of property was owned by the Texas Forest Service (TFS) at the time our survey
investigations were underway, and it is land owned by the State of Texas. Our Antiquities Code of Texas
permit application to conduct archeological survey investigations on this piece of TFS land was not signed
by the TFS. The Texas Historical Commission (the agency that would issue the antiquities permit) chose not
to process the permit application because they are currently negotiating with the TFS to obtain the larger
tract of land that our proposed small survey tract is situated on. There is no timetable known in which the
land deal is to be concluded, so this part of our proposed survey effort could not be conducted.
2. Following the requirements of the Antiquities permit issued by the Texas Historical Commission for any
archeological survey investigations conducted at Caddo Mounds State Historic Site (see Figure 13), shovel
test and metal detector locations must be located using a GPS system that insures sub-meter accuracy.

Archeological Survey Investigations to Identify 17th- early 19th Century Caddo Sites
San Pedro Creek Tract, Area 15A, Houston County, Texas

Four archeological sites were identified and recorded during the survey of the Area 15A tract along the
west side of San Pedro Creek in Houston County, Texas, namely the Weinert (41HO262) site and the Ivie
#1-3 (41HO263-265) sites (see Figure 25). Because of the strong possibility that the Ivie #1 site (41HO263)
is an historic Caddo site, or at least was occupied sometime during the mid- to late 17th century, and is thus
associated with the European use of the Camino Real de los Tejas, the findings from our investigations there
are summarized in the main body of this report.
41HO262, Weinert Site
The Weinert site is a prehistoric site of unknown age and cultural affiliation discovered during shovel
testing of a sandy alluvial rise (220-230 feet amsl) at the northern end of the Area 15A tract (see Figure
25), about 300 m west of San Pedro Creek. A total of six shovel tests contained low densities (1.17 artifacts
per positive shovel test, or ca. 9.4 artifacts per m2) of prehistoric lithic debris (Table A2.1) in archeological
deposits that are ca. 40 cm in thickness. The site covers approximately 8000 m2 (ca. 2 acres) of the wooded
alluvial rise.

The lithic debris documented in the shovel tests at the Weinert site includes a translucent gray chert
(n=2), a dark gray chert with white inclusions (n=1, probably from a Central Texas source), the local coarsegrained Glover quartzite (n=1, see Perttula and Nelson 2006), a heat-treated quartzite (n=1), and petrified
wood (n=2). The quartzite, Glover quartzite, and petrified wood pieces are from locally available gravels
collected in the San Pedro Creek stream bed.
41HO264, Ivie #2 Site
The Ivie #2 site is situated on a sandy rise (230 feet amsl) at the edge of the San Pedro Creek floodplain
(see Figure 25). The rise is in a maintained pasture, cultivated for winter grasses, with good (40%) surface
visibility. A small tributary to San Pedro Creek is about 50 m to the north.

In addition to numerous prehistoric Caddo artifacts that were visible on the surface of the site, three
shovel tests were excavated on the rise to determine if there were intact archeological deposits preserved on
the landform. Each of the shovel tests had prehistoric artifacts to 60 cm bs (Table A2.2); the archeological
deposits may be deeper, but the water table was encountered at 60 cm bs during the shovel testing. The
density of prehistoric artifacts is moderate: 12.0 artifacts per positive shovel test (ca. 96 artifacts per m2).
The site covers an estimated 4000 m2 (ca. 1 acre).

*dart point, 20-40 cm bs
None of the shovel tests encountered any Caddo pottery sherds, but a contracting stem Gary dart point
stem fragment—diagnostic of a Woodland period occupation dating from ca. 2500-1200 years B.P.)—
was noted in ST 26 (20-40 cm bs) (see Table A2.2). The Gary point was made from a heat-treated local
quartzite. Measurements of the stem width (12.0 mm) and thickness (5.4 mm) suggest that the Ivie #2 point
is an example of a Gary, var. Camden point, the latest of the Woodland period Gary points, estimated by
Schambach (1982, 1998) to date from ca. 1700-1200 B.P.
The seven ceramic sherds (six body sherds and one base sherd) found at the Ivie #2 site are tempered
primarily with grog (crushed sherds or fired clay), with the regular use of both crushed bone and hematite
aplastics (see Appendix 3). The sherds are from vessels fired primarily in a low oxygen or reducing
environment (71%), but two body sherds were from a vessel (or vessels) that was incompletely oxidized
during firing (cf. Teltser 1993). The sherds are apparently from relatively large vessels, based on body sherd
wall thickness values that range from 5.8-10.0 mm; the one flat base sherd is 10.2 mm thick.
Four of the body sherds from the Ivie #2 site are decorated: two with rows of tool punctations (Figure
43a); one with closely-spaced parallel incised lines; and a fourth sherd with parallel brushing marks (Figure
43b). None of the sherds are sufficiently large in size, or on those parts of vessels, that would allow them to
be typologically identified. Nevertheless, the presence of brushed sherds in the small ceramic assemblage
is indicative of a Caddo occupation that could have started in Middle Caddo period times (ca. A.D. 12001400), but it is more likely that the Caddo occupation took place sometime after ca. A.D. 1400. Brushed
utility ware pottery is prevalent only after ca. A.D. 1400 in this part of the Neches River basin (see Perttula
and Nelson 2006, 2007), and is particularly abundant in Historic Caddo Allen phase components. In
Historic Caddo components investigated at Mission Tejas State Park, directly east of the Area 15A survey

tract (see Figure 25), brushed pottery comprises between 53-57% of all the sherds at the Nabedache Blanco
(41HO211) and Nabedache Azul (41HO214) sites.
Lithic debris was common on the surface of the Ivie #2 site as well as in each of the three positive
shovel tests. Materials represented in the lithic debris includes both local—quartzite (n=8, sometimes
heat-treated), Glover quartzite (n=27), hematite (n=1), red chert (n=1), quartz (n=1), and petrified wood
(n=7)—and non-local (i.e., Central Texas) sources. Among the latter are brownish-gray chert (n=1), grayishbrown chert (n=1), dark gray chert (n=3), translucent gray chert (n=2), gray chert (n=2), and light gray chert
(n=2). Local raw materials comprise 80% of the lithic debris from the Ivie #2 site; these raw materials were
gathered from both local stream gravel and bedrock sources, based on cortical pieces having either streamrolled or bedrock-roughened surfaces.
Wood charcoal was also noted between 20-60 cm bs in ST 26 and ST 27 at the Ivie #2 site (see Table
A2.2).
41HO265, Ivie #3 Site
The Ivie #3 site is a prehistoric site of unknown age and cultural affiliation. It was located by our survey
team on a small sandy alluvial rise (230 feet amsl) at the edge of the San Pedro Creek floodplain (see Figure
25); the site, which covers ca. 1500 m2, is currently in a recently cultivated pasture. A small tributary to San
Pedro Creek is about 40 m south of the site.

In addition to two pieces of lithic debris that were noted on the surface of the rise, shovel testing
documented a low density (1.33 artifacts per positive shovel test, or ca. 10.6 artifacts per m2) of prehistoric
lithic artifacts between 0-40 cm bs (Table A2.3). The lithic debris includes pieces of gray chert (n=1), dark
gray chert (n=1), a light gray chert (n=1), petrified wood (n=1), and Glover quartzite (n=2). Lithic debris
of petrified wood and Glover quartzite with a smoothed cortex indicate these pieces are from raw material
gathered in the San Pedro Creek stream gravels.

41HO266, Gary Lovell #1
The Gary Lovell #1 site is a prehistoric site of unknown age situated on a ridge toe slope (270 feet
amsl) overlooking the San Pedro Creek floodplain. The site was discovered through shovel testing (ST 16)
and pedestrian archeological survey, and pieces of lithic debris were observed over a 30 x 40 m area of the
landform (see Figure 23). Archeological deposits in the Kirvin fine sandy loam soils are approximately 20
cm in thickness.
Lithic debris from the site includes a mixture of pieces knapped from local and non-local raw materials
and/or tools. The local raw materials (57% of the small lithic debris sample) include petrified wood
(n=3/33% cortical) and quartzite (n=1/0% cortical). The non-local raw materials (43%) are chert that
probably ultimately originated in Central Texas, but may have been procured in gravel beds of streams east
of the Edwards Plateau, including the Brazos, Trinity, and possibly the Neches River (cf. Girard 1995).
These include gray chert (n=2/0% cortical) and yellowish-white chert (n=1/100% cortical).
41HO267, Gary Lovell #2
The Gary Lovell #2 site is also a prehistoric site of unknown age. It is situated on a natural rise or
alluvial fan (ca. 230 ft. amsl) along the edge of the San Pedro Creek floodplain. A few pieces of chipped
stone were noted on the surface of the landform, and seven shovel tests were subsequently excavated on the
landform (ST 41-47, see Figure 23). Six of them contained archeological materials (lithic debris) between
0-40 cm bs (Table A2.4), and the overall extent of the site is estimated at 100 x 80 m (ca. 2 acres). The
density of artifacts in the shovel testing is a low 1.0 per positive shovel test, or ca. 8 artifacts per m2.

The recovered artifacts include a single expedient flake tool (bilateral unifacial retouch/use-wear)
made from a dark brown chert cortical flake and seven pieces of lithic debris (see Table A2.4). The lithic
debris includes a mixture of pieces knapped from local and non-local raw materials and/or tools. The local
raw materials (43% of the small lithic debris sample) include petrified wood (n=1/0% cortical) and the
distinctive coarse-grained Glover quartzite (n=2/0% cortical) (see Perttula and Nelson 2006). The nonlocal raw materials (57%) are chert that probably ultimately originated in Central Texas, but may have been
procured in gravel beds of streams east of the Edwards Plateau, including the Brazos, Trinity, and possibly
the Neches River (cf. Girard 1995). These include light gray chert (n=1/0) and gray chert (n=3/0% cortical).

41NA337, M. L. Wisener
The M. L. Wisener site (41NA337) was located during shovel testing in the King Creek tract, situated
between the Wes Wisener site (41NA336) to the north (separated from it by a shallow southward-flowing
tributary to King Creek), and some distance north of the David King site (see Figure 33). The site, which
covers approximately 1400 m2, is on a wooded alluvial landform with Attoyac fine sandy loam (0-4% slope)
sediments (Dolezel 1980:15). The current channel of King Creek is approximately 140 m east of the site.
Four shovel tests contain Caddo pottery sherds and sherdlets in archeological deposits that are a
maximum of 40 cm in thickness (Table A2.5). Not including the sherdlets, the density of ceramic sherds in
the shovel testing is a low 3.0 sherds per positive shovel test (ca. 24 sherds per m2). The density ranges from
1-4 sherds per shovel test, with the highest densities in ST 27 and ST 28 along the eastern edge of the site.
The plain to decorated sherd ratio (OCR) is 0.50, comparable to that from the Historic Caddo occupation
at the J. T. King (41NA15; see Walker and Perttula 2010), but slightly higher than P/DR ratios at the
Historic Caddo David King (41NA321, 0.36) site, Henry M. (41NA60, Perttula et al. 2010), or the Deshazo
(41NA27, Fields 1995) sites.

Parallel brushed body sherds from Bullard Brushed vessels comprise 75% of the small sample of
decorated sherds from the M. L. Wisener site; 50% of the sherds from the site are brushed. Both proportions
are consistent with an Historic Caddo ceramic assemblage in this part of the Angelina River basin. One
body sherd (ST 27, 20-40 cm bs) has a single broad parallel incised line. Another body sherd (ST 29, 0-20
cm bs) has a rectangular cross-hatched engraved zone adjacent to two widely-spaced parallel engraved
lines; the orientation of these elements is unknown. This sherd may be from a King Engraved vessel, but
more sherds from this vessel would be needed to make a definitive occupation.
Given the absence of Patton Engraved sherds from the M. L. Wisener site—which is not surprising
given that only eight decorated sherds have been found at the site during our investigations—it is premature
to identify the occupation here as Historic Caddo, Allen phase, in age and cultural affiliation. Its setting
between two other Historic Caddo sites (David King and Wes Wisener), and its proximity to a third (J. T.
King), along this stretch of King Creek (see Figure 33) suggests that the M. L. Wisener was also occupied in
Historic Caddo times.
Faunal Remains, by LeeAnna Schniebs
One unidentifiable large mammal bone fragment was recovered from ST 27 (20-40 cm bs) at the M. L.
Wisener Site (41NA337). The specimen is not burned and weighs 0.2 grams.
