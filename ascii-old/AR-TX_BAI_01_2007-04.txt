ABSTRACT
Between December 18 and 20, 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. at the request of
Chica & Associates, Inc. and on behalf of the project sponsor the Texas Department of Transportation’s
(TxDOT) Abilene District, conducted an intensive cultural resource surveys prior to the construction of
new bridges on US 83 at the Salt Fork of the Brazos River (CSJ: 0032-07-023) and on US 83 at Stinking
Creek (CSJ: 0032-07-030) in Stonewall County. Augmented by shovel testing and backhoe trenching,
investigations discovered one prehistoric archeological site (41SN80) adjacent to the Salt Fork of the
Brazos River study area. No cultural resources were identified at the Stinking Creek project area and no
artifacts were collected during field investigations so there was no curation.

INTRODUCTION
Between December 18 and 20, 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc., at the request of
Chica & Associates, Inc., and on behalf of the project sponsor the Texas Department of Transportation’s
(TxDOT) Abilene District, conducted intensive cultural resource surveys prior to the construction of new
bridges on US 83 at the Salt Fork of the Brazos River (CSJ: 0032-07-023) and on US 83 at Stinking
Creek (CSJ: 0032-07-030) in Stonewall County. The bridge over the Salt Fork of the Brazos River is
approximately 20 miles north of Aspermont, Texas, while the bridge over Stinking Creek is
approximately four miles north of Aspermont (Figures 1, 2.1, and 2.2). Proposed construction at each
location would involve the removal of the existing concrete bridges and embankments in preparation for
new prestressed concrete slab bridges. Additional construction would include the widening and paving of
the 125-foot long approach roadways at the ends of each bridge.
The proposed construction would occur only within the existing variable width (100 to 300 feet) US 83
right-of-way (ROW). At the Salt Fork of the Brazos River, the existing US 83 roadway is 42 feet wide
and consists of two 12-foot wide lanes and two 9-foot wide shoulders (Figure 3). The existing 1935
concrete bridge measures 518 feet long by 50.3 feet wide. The proposed bridge would be 540 feet long by
46 feet wide and accommodate two 12-foot wide lanes and two 10-foot wide shoulders. The proposed
bridge would utilize pre-stressed concrete spans and the 125-foot long approach at each end of the bridge
would be repaved to match the width of the proposed new structure (Figure 4). According to available
engineering plans, no temporary or permanent easements or new ROW will be required for this project.
The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) therefore, measures approximately 790 feet in length (the new
bridge and approaches) and 100 to 300 feet wide (width of existing ROW).
At Stinking Creek, the existing roadway is 42 feet wide with two 12-foot wide lanes and 9-foot wide
shoulders within an existing 153-foot wide ROW (Figure 5). The existing bridge is approximately 103
feet long and 42 feet wide. The proposed bridge would be of similar dimensions and it can be assumed
that repaving would occur 125 feet from each end (Figure 6). The APE for this bridge replacement would
be therefore, approximately 350 feet long (the existing bridge and 125-foot long approaches) and 153 feet
wide, as no new ROW or temporary easements are proposed.
As the proposed construction would occur on property belonging to the State of Texas and administered
by TxDOT, the projects are subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in
Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for
recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any state agency
must identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage
those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Division of Archeology administers the code’s
provisions. Archeological survey must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC
in accordance with the provisions of the code. The current project was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 4351 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.

It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to protect significant cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are federally
funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the
ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by federal
agencies.
The federal regulatory process is described in detail in the ACHP regulations (36 CFR 800) and in the
regulations of the agencies and federal divisions engaged in historic preservation. Protection of cultural
resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site significance as defined
by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the ACHP is the final arbiter of the Section
106 process, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and concurrence by the involved agency
and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by the THC.
Investigations were conducted in accordance with the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA)
among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) among TxDOT and THC. The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological
survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the
Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC
in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was
to identify and describe all cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural
resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as
avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Stonewall County is located in the Rolling Plains ecological region of Texas that is characterized by a
gently undulating to rolling plain. Elevations across the Rolling Plains range from approximately 1,000
feet in the eastern margins of the region to 2,200 feet at the base of the Cap Rock Escarpment on the
region’s western edges (Jordan et al. 1984).
GEOLOGY
The geology of the Salt Fork of the Brazos River project area consists of the Permian-age Blaine
Formation, Pleistocene Fluviatile terrace deposits, and Quaternary Alluvium (Barnes 1993). Pleistocene
terrace deposits consist primarily of gravel, sand, and silt, though cobbles of chert, quartzite, as well as
igneous and metamorphic rock and caliche are common (Barnes 1993). The Blaine Formation consists of
thick deposits of interbedded shale, sandstone, dolomite, and gypsum (Barnes 1993). Quaternary
Alluvium is located in and along the river channel parallel to older, adjacent Pleistocene fluviatile terrace
deposits. In the upland margins overlooking the river valley near the northern and southern ends of the
project area is the Blaine Formation. The Stinking Creek bridge location is also underlain by the Blaine
Formation.
SOILS
Soils at the Salt Fork of the Brazos River are identified as Lincoln soils, eroded, and the Owens-Badland
association. Lincoln soils, eroded, consist of deep, loamy fine sand to fine sand formed in alluvium and
found on floodplains. Adjacent to the Lincoln soils are the Knoco-Badland association soils which are
shallow—3 to 20 inches in depth—sloping to strongly sloping upland soils that formed in shaly clay
sediments. The Badland component of the association is found on eroded escarpments and is composed of
“barren outcrops of shaly and clayey red-bed materials” (Natural Resources Conservation Service
[NRCS] 2006).
Soils within the Stinking Creek APE consist of a narrow band of Colorado soils adjacent to the stream
channel, with the Knoco-Badland association present south of the stream and Clairemont silt loam north
of the stream. Colorado soils are restricted to floodplains and consist of clay loams that formed in loamy
alluviums with depths that can exceed 60 inches. The Knoco-Badland association soils are shallow—3 to
20 inches in depth—and weathered in place from claystone. Rocks and boulders are common on the
sloping soils. Claremont silt loam is found on stream terraces and is a deep silty loam derived from loamy
alluvium (NRCS 2006).
VEGETATION
Stonewall County lies in the Kansan biotic province (Blair 1950). Vegetation is a mixed-grass plain
dominated by little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and
western wheatgrass (Agropyron Smithii). A mesquite-grass association is common and dominated by
mesquite (Prosopis grandulosa), with various species of grama (Bouteloua spp.), three-awn (Aristida
spp.) and broomweed (Gutierrezia texana). Shorter grass species include buffalograss (Buchloe

dactyloides) and various grama grasses. Land use adjacent to the bridge is ranch land and/or cropland,
except for those areas in the adjacent Badlands that cannot support cultivation or significant grazing.
Within the maintained ROW, vegetation consists of short grasses and forbs.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to field investigations, a background records and literature review of site and project files was
conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the THC, and on the THC’s online
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) to provide information on the potential for archeological site
occurrence/density throughout the project area. That review found that there are several previously
investigated project areas and previously recorded archeological sites within a 1,000-meter radius of the
project area.
Located approximately 0.25 mile south of the bridge spanning the Salt Fork of the Brazos River is site
41SN75, which is located immediately adjacent to the western ROW fence on US 83. This site was
recorded by C. K. Chandler in 1988 and described as an early twentieth century, well preserved dugout
house approximately six feet deep. The entrance was open with the other three walls constructed of thick,
flat-laid stones with mud mortar. At the same time Chandler recorded 41SN75, he also recorded historic
site 41SN76—a second early twentieth century dugout house about seven feet deep and situated roughly
0.50 mile north of the bridge and 75 feet west of the US 83 ROW fence.
In addition to the dugout sites documented by Chandler in 1988, the 1936 General Highway Map of
Stonewall County shows two structures in the vicinity of the US 83 crossing of the Salt Fork of the
Brazos River. Approximately 0.25 mile north of the river, the map shows one structure located 100 to 150
feet west of the highway. A second structure is depicted about 0.50 to 0.75 mile south of the river and 100
to 150 feet west of US 83. Although the proveniences of these structures do not exactly match the
locations of sites 41SN75 and 41SN76 as described by Chandler in 1988, given the probable margin of
error with the location of structures on the county highway map, it is possible that these structures were
recorded as sites 41SN75 and 41SN76.
Approximately 0.35 mile north of Stinking Creek on US 83 is 41SN2, Beidelman Ranch site. This
probable bison kill site was excavated by paleontologists in 1939. They belatedly realized that human
occupation has occurred when a Plainview-like point was encountered within a group of bone fragments.
A similar point had been found in a near-surface context previously. By 1945 the site had been eroded
away (Suhm 1960). Roughly 0.6 mile south of Stinking Creek on the west side of the highway is the
Shadle family cemetery. There is no information available on the TASA or in TARL’s records concerning
this cemetery.

CULTURE HISTORY
The project area is located in the southeastern extent of the Southern Plains and the southwestern edge of
the Rolling Plains. This area lacks the cultural syntheses that other regions of Texas have. The most
exhaustive, long term archeological studies in the area were conducted to the north at Lubbock Lake
(Johnson and Holliday 1995) and at Justiceburg Reservoir, now Lake Allan Henry (Boyd 1997; Boyd et
al. 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, and 1994). However, the earliest systematic investigations were conducted
during the 1920s and 1930s by E. B. Sayles (1935) Five broad periods typically define the prehistoric
cultural history of the project area. These include the Paleoindian, Archaic, Ceramic, and Protohistoric
periods (Johnson and Holliday 1995). Earlier chronologies incorporate the Ceramic and Protohistoric into
a single Late Prehistoric period (Suhm et al. 1954). As only prehistoric cultural resources were identified
during this survey, this background is limited to a general overview of regional prehistory.
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The earliest well-documented evidence of human occupation in the region appears in the Paleoindian
period during the Late Pleistocene around 9,500 B.C. at the Blackwater Draw, Miami, and Lubbock Lake
sites (Johnson and Holliday 1995:552). During the Late Pleistocene the environment was humid with
mild winters and summers and the mean temperature was lower than it is today (Johnson 1986).
Grasslands covered much of the plains, and many small streams crossed the countryside (Johnson and
Holliday 1995:552).
Megafauna such as mammoth, Bison antiquus, camel, giant turtle, horse, short-faced bear, giant beaver,
and peccary inhabited this landscape (Hester 1972). The common view is that paleoindians were nomadic
hunter-gathers who followed large game and lacked many semi-permanent or permanent structures
(Johnson and Holliday 1995), but recent evidence suggests that a more diversified and complex lifeway
may have existed. The tool kit from this time included large, intricately worked, fluted, lanceolate stone
points that were probably hafted on a spear-like weapon. These points include Clovis, Folsom, Midland,
Plainview, and Firstview styles.
ARCHAIC PERIOD
As the cooler and wetter climates of the Late Pleistocene gave way to the warmer and drier Holocene,
there were marked changes in fauna and flora of the region. The large mammals vanished from the
landscape, possibly aided by overhunting. In the midst of this dramatic environmental shift, a range of
cultural changes mark the beginning of the long Archaic period (6,500 B.C. to 700–900 A.D.). With the
majority of the large mammals gone and the environment drier, Southern Plains cultures became more
sedentary and dependent on B. bison, which had replaced the larger B. antiquus, and smaller game such as
deer and rabbit. While lanceolate projectile point forms remained in use during the Early Archaic,
stemmed dart points began to proliferate and eventually replace the lanceolate forms altogether. The dart
points were better suited to the lightweight shafts propelled by the atlatl, and the entire toolkit was better
adapted to small game. Ground-stone artifacts found at sites of this age may be indicative of a more
generalized diet containing more plant material.

Population grew during the Archaic despite the changing climates and resource base. Boyd et al.
(1989:44) discuss a number of climatic “shifts” during the Archaic that are marked primarily by drier
episodes. Each shift indicates a potential change in priorities between plant and animal resources. Shift 1
(6,500 B.C. to 4,400 B.C.) roughly corresponds with the Early Archaic of the Central Texas chronologies.
Bison were the most important food and plants less important. Shift 2 (4,400 B.C. to 3,500 B.C.)
correlates with the Hypsithermal, or Drought 1. The Hypsithermal was a global phenomenon during
which warmer, drier conditions and prolonged, severe droughts affected much of North America. During
this time, the parched grasslands and warmer temperatures of the Southern Plains became less attractive
to bison (Johnson and Holliday 1995:526). Bison herds traveled south into the area less frequently, and
people became more dependent on plant resources (Dillehay 1974). Water became critical during the
prolonged droughts of the Hypsithermal. At the Mustang Springs Site, seven wells that date to this time
were documented by Meltzer (1991). Shift 3 (3,500 to 3,000 B.C.) marked a return to more mesic
conditions. Bison returned to the area in greater numbers and once again became an important food
resource.
Between 3,000 B.C and 2,500 B.C, Johnson and Holliday (1995:526) postulate another prolonged hot and
dry period (their Shift 4 or Drought 2) that was less severe than the earlier Hypsithermal. As bison ranged
the cooler northern plains, plant resources again became a dietary staple. Shifts 2, 3, and 4 overlap with
Middle Archaic (ca. 3,500 B.C. to 1,100 B.C) dates from adjacent cultural chronologies. The final climate
shift (Shift 5) occurred between 2,500 and 1,000 B.C. and is once again identified with a reliance on bison
as the primary diet. Shift 5 overlaps with the beginning of the Late Archaic (ca. 1,100 B.C to 600–700
A.D.), during which time the climate stabilized and conditions developed that have remained to the
modern era (Johnson and Holliday 1995:528).
CERAMIC AND PROTOHISTORIC PERIODS
The Ceramic Period (ca. 600–700 A.D. to 1540 A.D.) is denoted by the appearance of two technologies
important to the area: ceramics and the bow and arrow. Arrow points, dart points, and coarse-tempered
cord-marked ceramics were found associated with each other at Deadman’s Shelter. This seems to
indicate that there was a transition between technologies rather than an abrupt switch (Hughes and Wiley
1978). Diagnostic materials for the period are corner-notched Scallorn points and ceramic trade items
from the Mogollon and Puebloan cultures (Perttula et al. 1995).
The Protohistoric period (1540 A.D. to 1750 A.D.) was defined by Johnson and Holliday (1995:530) as
the presence of Europeans in the New World but the apparent lack of European items in the archeological
record. The typical arrow point associated with this time period is the triangular, often serrated Garza
point (Turner and Hester 1999:215). Very little is known about this period, but Hickerson (1994:24)
believes that the area was populated by the Jumano Indians by the time of the Coronado expedition. By
the early 1700s, the Jumanos were eradicated by disease and the Apache, whom they had been battling
with for decades or more (Hickerson 1994). Later, the Apache were supplanted by the Comanche who
controlled the area until the 1870s (Lowry et al. 2002:5).

METHODS
The intensive archeological surveys on US 83 involved surface and subsurface investigations of sufficient
intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of any discovered cultural
resources. Investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the Council
of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983).
Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the PA among the FHWA, the THC,
the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC.
Surface investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey with backhoe trenching and shovel
testing as appropriate by two archeologists systematically examining the ground surface within the APEs
as well as what could be observed on private property outside of, and adjacent to, the existing TxDOT
ROW at both bridge locations. A significant proportion of the soils in the study areas are primarily upland
soils that developed in situ from clayey shale and are not, therefore, conducive for containing buried
intact cultural deposits. However, backhoe trenching was conducted where deep alluvium was present.
Shovel tests were 30 to 40 centimeters in width and excavated with a square-head shovel. All sediments
removed from shovel tests were screened through ¼-inch wire mesh. All appropriate shovel test data was
recorded on Blanton & Associates shovel test forms and plotted with hand-held global positioning system
(GPS) receivers. All field investigations were thoroughly documented with digital cameras. No cultural
materials were collected so curation was unnecessary.
Because of significant erosion, a lack of deep alluvial deposits, and shallow bedrock, backhoe trenches
were not excavated at Stinking Creek. Excavations there consisted of shovel testing the shallow alluvium.
However, trenching was necessary at the Salt Fork of the Brazos River project area. Excavated backhoe
trenches were approximately five meters long, one meter wide, and 1.5 meters deep. All trenching
activities were monitored by archeologists to avoid any unnecessary damage to potentially buried cultural
deposits. Following excavations, the archeologists cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ
artifacts, features, or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units in each trench were recorded
and described in detail on a Blanton & Associates geologic profile form and a photographic record of the
investigations was made. Backhoe trench locations were plotted with hand-held GPS receivers.
Site documentation involved the recording of the horizontal and vertical extent of all archeological sites
identified within the APE. Site data included a description of the site’s environment, cultural materials
noted within the APE, and observations on the continuance of any site that extend outside of the APE. All
recorded sites were evaluated with respect to their eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP (as per eligibility
criteria set forth in National Park Service regulations 36 CFR 60.4.) or for formal designation as a SAL
(as per criteria established in Chapter 26.8 of the Texas Antiquities Code).

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Shovel testing and backhoe trenching on US 83 at the Salt Fork of the Brazos River and at Stinking Creek
revealed shallow very dry, hard, and compacted construction fill or shallow and dry clayey soils truncated
by roadway construction overlying shaley bedrock. Ground surface visibility throughout the project areas
was 50 percent or greater. The following synthesizes the investigations conducted at each project area,
including a description of prehistoric site 41SN80 that was discovered adjacent to the APE at the Salt
Fork of the Brazos project area.
SALT FORK OF THE BRAZOS RIVER (CSJ: 0032-07-023)
In the APE, the Salt Fork of the Brazos exhibits a broad channel approximately 500 feet wide with
typically gently sloping cutbanks except for some moderately steep and dissected areas with exposed
bedrock (Figures 7.1, 7.2, and 8). Surface inspection of the AEP revealed exposed bedrock within the
northeast and northwest quadrants of the project area, as well as within parts of the southwest quadrant
(Figures 9 through 11).
Due to the exposed bedrock north of the river, backhoe trenching was not necessary, so only shovel tests
were excavated there. Shovel Tests (STs) 1–3 contained dry and hard reddish brown sandy clay loam to a
maximum depth of 27 centimeters below ground surface before encountering shale bedrock. Shovel Tests
1 and 2 were located in the southwest quadrant of the APE, with ST 3 excavated north of the creek in the
northeast quadrant (see Figure 6). Because of the presence of deep alluvium within the southeast quadrant
of the crossing, as well as what appeared to be a remnant wedge of alluvium in the southwest quadrant,
Backhoe Trenches (BHT) 1 and 2 were excavated in those areas (see Figures 7.1 and 7.2).
The excavation of BHT 1 revealed three stratigraphic zones between 0 and 200 centimeters below ground
surface (Figure 12). Zone I (0 to 44 centimeters) was dry and hard compacted reddish brown sand and
sandy clay construction fill with modern debris and trash in the upper 20 centimeters. The lower boundary
of Zone I was abrupt and smooth. Zone II consisted of massive very friable yellowish red loamy sand
with a loose granular structure. Inclusions included occasional rootlets and rodent burrows between 44
and 200 centimeters below ground surface. The lower boundary of Zone II was very abrupt and smooth at
200 centimeters where shaley bedrock (Zone III) was encountered.
Similar to BHT 1, BHT 2 contained three stratigraphic zones between 0 and 87 centimeters below ground
surface (Figure 13). From 0 to 30 centimeters, Zone I consisted of hard, dry, and compacted red sandy
clay construction fill with a blocky subangular structure and an abrupt smooth lower boundary. Zone II
was moist very firm brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay that extended from 30 to 87 centimeters below ground
surface. The matrix contained numerous prominent mottles of greenish gray (Gley #2, 10G 6/1) gley, a
hydric soil. Zone II exhibited a very abrupt and smooth lower boundary. At 87 centimeters below ground
surface, excavations hit shaley bedrock and excavations were halted.

Surface and Subsurface investigations within the APE discovered no cultural resources within the APE.
Given the results of the shallow shovel tests and exposed bedrock of the study area, there is little potential
for impacting buried intact cultural deposits during the proposed construction. However, roughly
30 meters north of the northern APE boundary, the survey discovered one surficial prehistoric
archeological site (41SN80) within the existing ROW.
Site 41SN80
This site is a prehistoric surface scatter within the existing US 83 ROW about 40 meters north of the
proposed APE. The site consists of burned rock and chert debitage scattered over an area approximately
40 meters north-south by 30 meters east-west (Figure 14). The site is focused on a prominent ridge that
defines part of the eastern edge of the existing US 83 ROW (Figure 15). Artifacts are eroding down slope
from the top of this ridge, as the surface scatter was observed at the foot of the ridge and extending east
and upslope. The existing ROW fence roughly bisects the ridge from north to south and the artifact scatter
continues east of the fence onto adjacent private property. The southern end of the landform overlooks the
river, while at the northern end of the site there is a saddle that separates the ridge from the main part of
the upland plateau that continues northward. Investigations found no evidence that the site extended north
of the saddle or west of the highway. Ground surface visibility was greater than 50 percent.
Cultural materials consisted of a moderate to low density scatter of burned quartzite, tested siliceous
cobbles, and chipped-stone chert debitage (between 100 and 200 observed specimens) with no discernible
concentration areas. Shovel testing within the planned APE south of the site, in conjunction with the
exposed or shallowly buried bedrock throughout much of the project area, indicated that there is no
potential for intact buried cultural deposits within the proposed APE. Based on those conditions and
excellent surface visibility, no shovel tests were excavated on site. No diagnostic artifacts were identified
on site so the temporal affiliation of 41SN80 is currently unknown. Although no cultural features were
discovered on the site, the presence of burned rock suggests that thermal features had been present.
No part of site 41SN80 is located within the proposed APE. However, part of the site does occupy the
eastern margins of the existing US 83 ROW north of the APE. The ground surface has been very
disturbed and the surface artifacts are certainly in secondary contexts. Given its disturbed surficial context
and its lack of temporal diagnostics and cultural features, it is Blanton & Associates’ opinion that the part
of site 41SN80 remaining within the existing US 83 ROW has very little research potential and would not
provide any new or important information concerning regional prehistory.
STINKING CREEK (CSJ: 0032-74-030)
Stinking Creek is located 16 miles south of the Salt Fork of the Brazos River. In the APE, Stinking Creek
exhibits a relatively narrow channel approximately 20 feet wide with gently sloping cutbanks (Figure 16).
Surface inspection of the AEP revealed reddish clayey soil with fragments of claystone and shale bedrock
exposed on the ground surface across much of the project area, with ground surface visibility about 40
percent (Figure 17). There were no buried or overhead utilities. No prehistoric or historic cultural
materials were discovered on the ground surface within the APE, only modern trash and roadside debris.

Subsurface archeological investigations were initiated with shovel testing to determine the depth of the
alluvial deposits before bringing in the backhoe from the Salt Fork of the Brazos River project area. A
total of eight shovel tests were excavated across the study area, two in each quadrant (see Figure 16). On
the ground surface south of Stinking Creek the study area contains the aforementioned reddish clay soil
with fragments of shale and mudstone/claystone bedrock, which corresponds with the Knoco-Badland
soil association mapped for that part of the APE. The excavation of Shovel Tests 1–4 there revealed
shallow, hard, and dry sandy clay overlying shale bedrock (Table 1). These tests uncovered no cultural
materials.

Shovel Tests 5–8 were excavated north of Stinking Creek and exhibited several clayey strata (see
Table 1). With the exception of ST 5, the shovel tests excavated north of Stinking Creek consisted of two
sandy or silty clay loam strata overlying a sandy clay stratum. Beneath the sandy clay, the basal stratum
consisted of olive brown clay with pieces of eroded mudstone/claystone bedrock. In the northeast
quadrant of the creek crossing, ST 5 consisted of a sandy clay loam stratum overlying olive brown clay
with pieces of eroded mudstone/claystone. Below the basal stratum (32 to 40 centimeters below ground
surface), the third strata consisted of pinkish white caliche and excavations were halted.
Hand excavations at Stinking Creek were sufficient to determine that there are no deep alluvial deposits in
the APE with the potential to contain buried intact cultural resources. Although some recent alluvium was
identified within the APE, it appeared that most has eroded away. Rather, the encountered soils have
experienced significant erosion and have been disturbed by highway cut and fill construction. Further, the
area’s predominately interbedded clay, shale, sandstone, and gypsum geology, as well as shallow clayey
soils, are not conducive for containing intact cultural deposits. Given those conditions, there is little
potential for impacting intact buried cultural resources by the proposed bridge replacement and roadway
improvement construction.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive archeological survey on US 83 at the Salt Fork of the Brazos River and at Stinking Creek
resulted in the discovery of one previously unrecorded prehistoric archeological site (41SN80). The site
was discovered outside of the APE but within the existing US 83 ROW north of the Salt Fork of the
Brazos River. None of site 41SN80 extends south into the proposed APE and would not be impacted by
the proposed construction. No cultural resources were discovered within or near the Stinking Creek
project area. Investigations concluded that the existing US 83 ROW and planned APE at both bridge
locations have experienced disturbances from erosion and roadway construction and maintenance
activities.
Artifacts observed on 41SN80 were in secondary contexts, having eroded down slope from the upland
ridge east of the highway. Those materials have been displaced further by subsequent highway
construction and maintenance. No diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were discovered on site. Given
those conditions, the part of 41SN80 located within the existing US 83 ROW has little research potential.
However, as the part of site east of the ROW could not be investigated, the nature and integrity of those
remains is unknown, as are their significance. It is, therefore, the opinion of Blanton & Associates that the
portions of site 41SN80 within the existing US 83 ROW would not contribute to the site’s overall NRHP
and SAL eligibility if, at a later date, the part of the site east of the existing ROW was determined to be
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or for formal SAL designation.
In conclusion, Blanton & Associates recommends that, as survey efforts discovered no intact surface or
subsurface cultural materials within the proposed APEs at the Salt Fork of the Brazos River and Stinking
Creek that could contribute new or important data to our understanding of regional prehistory, the
proposed construction should be allowed to proceed as planned within the existing US 83 ROW at both
project areas without additional cultural resources investigations. However, if the planned construction or
future construction at both project areas require more workspace or new ROW east or west of the existing
ROW boundaries, then additional archeological investigations in those locations would be necessary prior
to construction. Further, if it is determined that TxDOT requires additional workspace for the proposed
construction within the existing US 83 ROW at 41SN80, Blanton & Associates recommends that
construction could also occur there because that part of the site is disturbed and has little to no potential
for containing intact buried cultural materials.
In the event that previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the
immediate area would cease and the TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental
discovery procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
