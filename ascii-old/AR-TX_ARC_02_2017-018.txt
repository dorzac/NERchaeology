ABSTRACT
The City of Grand Prairie is proposing to widen MacArthur Blvd [otherwise
known as Meyers Road] north of IH 30 in Dallas County, Texas. Site 41DL246,
recorded by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the early 1980s, is in
the area where trenches were dug for the drainage pipes and manhole. The site
was discovered in the western profile of the Trinity River Bank between 90 and
150 cmbs. Burnt faunal material and rocks were noted at the time of discovery,
but no lithics were found. In October 2015, the Texas Historical Commission
requested that the trenching be monitored to determine whether the road
improvements would impact site 41DL246. Halff Associates, Inc., which is
handling the environmental permitting for the project, contracted with AR
Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct archaeological monitoring of the drain
installation. A total of 53.2 meters of trench excavation was monitored on
December 1-2, 9, and 12, 2016. No evidence of site 41DL246 was found during
monitoring, nor evidence of any other deeply buried prehistoric sites. ARC
concludes that construction associated with the MacArthur Blvd. Road
Improvements project will not impact site 41DL246 and it would appear that the
site may have been lost during channelization of the river along this portion of the
road at some point in the last 20 years. Paperwork for this project will be curated
at the Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State University in San Marcos.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Grand Prairie is proposing to widen MacArthur Blvd [otherwise known as Meyers
Road] north of IH 30 in Dallas County, Texas (Figure 1). As part of this widening, drainage
pipes and a manhole are to be placed under the old road surface approximately 250 meters south
of the MacArthur Blvd. bridge and immediately west of the old intersection of MacArthur Blvd.
and a service road for the Grand Prairie Landfill. Site 41DL246, recorded by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in the early 1980s, is mapped in the area where trenches
were dug for the drainage pipes and manhole. In October 2015, the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) requested that the trenching be monitored to determine whether the road improvements
would impact site 41DL246. Halff Associates, Inc., which is handling the environmental
permitting for the project, contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct archaeological
monitoring of the drain installation. Approximately 53.2 meters of trench excavation was
monitored on December 1-2, 9, and 12, 2016.
The cultural resource investigation was required because the City of Grand Prairie is a state
entity and Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7472 was issued for the archaeological survey.
Relevant state legislation includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code,
Title 9, Chapter 191). The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission will review
this report on behalf of the State. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of
1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended
(PL-93-291).
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of
the THC (Council of Texas Archeologists n.d.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and
previous investigations within the study area. A chapter on the research design and methodology
employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL MONITORING OF THE MACARTHUR BLVD ROAD IMPROVEMENTS

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is located on the east bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River, a major
tributary that carries a perennial flow of water. The West Fork has incised a wide floodplain and
reached its lowest base level about 18,000 years ago (Ferring 1986:Figure 4). Since then, the
river has alluviated as aggradation increased. The meandering channel has left behind a series of
sloughs and cut-off meanders which apparently stabilized about 2,000 years ago (Shaunessy et
al. 1994:5). These geological processes have buried a complex web of channel and levee deposits
which span the past 18,000 years.
The study area is mapped atop Quaternary alluvium (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988).
According to the USDA soil survey, soils encountered in this area consist of Frio silty clay,
which are occasionally flooded and composed of very deep, well drained, moderately to slowly
permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium. The A and B horizons of
the Frio series consist of dark grayish brown silty clay that extends from the present ground
surface to approximately 53 inches where it encounters a C horizon of brown silty clay loams
(Coffee et al. 1980:60). However, the project area is located on a border between the Frio clay
and gently undulating and hilly Arents, loamy, to the south (Coffee et al. 1980:Sheets 29 and 36).
Arents is a map unit made up of areas that have been mined for gravel and sand. Because of
mixing during these mining operations, these soils are disturbed and do not have uniform layers.
When fragments of soil layers are encountered, the soil is mainly sandy clay loam, clay loam,
loam, or fine sandy loam in the upper 80 inches.
MacArthur Blvd is located in the Floodplains and Low Terraces ecoregion of the Texas
Blackland Prairies (Griffith et al. 2007:40-41). This ecoregion includes only the broadest
floodplains of the Trinity, Brazos, and Colorado rivers and covers primarily the Holocene
deposits and not the older, high terraces. The surrounding rolling prairie of the West Fork is
surfaced by clay and sandy loams that support cacti, scrub brush, mesquite, and live oak (Griffith
et al. 2007). Remnants of a bottomland hardwood forest occur in the West Fork floodplain and
the prehistoric environment would have provided habitat for deer, quail, dove, rabbit, squirrel,
raccoon and other animals (Jurney 1988; Martin 1988). Elm and post oak were the dominant
trees, along with hackberry, Spanish oak, and elm. Upland tree cover outside the valley was
composed primarily of post oak and blackjack oak (Peter and Jurney 1988).
No consensus has been reached about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North-Central Texas
over the past 11,000 years, though the following described investigations have provided some
interpretations. Research on the paleo-environment of North Central Texas by Ferring (1994a)
examined the Upper Trinity terraces. Ferring believed the Early Holocene (11,000 to 7,500 years
ago) was moister than today, while during the Middle Holocene (7,500 to 4,500 years ago) there
was a dry period, but moist conditions returned to North Central Texas during the Late
Holocene. This interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope analysis
(Humphrey and Ferring 1994). Further refinement of the past environment is described from a
buried archaeological site located in the Clear Fork of the Trinity River in Tarrant County where
soils, fauna, and vegetation indicated that the West Fork Paleosol dates between 2300-1000 years
ago. At that time the environment was cooler and wetter than at present (Hall et al. 2011). As

discussed in recent publications (Benson et al. 2006; Foster 2012), the period of the past four
thousand years has been one of oscillating climate swings every 500 to 800 years. The Medieval
Warm Period correlates with population growth in both Europe and North America between AD
900-1300. For the next three hundred years, a colder and wetter climate that at the present
prevailed and is termed the Little Ice Age. In the Southern Plains of Texas this was a time when
buffalo remains are commonly found in prehistoric sites (Dillehay 1974). The current warm
period began in the mid-1800s.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The archaeological literature lacks a definitive chronological framework for the Upper Trinity
River Basin and North Central Texas. For the purposes of this report, a prehistoric chronology,
based on Prikryl (1990), with an added historic period for North Central Texas is presented
below to provide the reader with a temporal framework for the culture history of the region.
Historic European
Protohistoric
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Archaic
Paleoindian

A.D. 1800 to Present
A.D. 1700 to A.D. 1800 [Historic Native American]
A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1700
A.D. 700 to A.D. 1200
6,000 B.C. to A.D. 700
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

Deep Holocene alluvium has been known to preserve buried occupation surfaces in the region,
both in the Holocene as at the Rough Green (41TR162) (Skinner et al. 1999) and Dalbey
(41DL350) sites and during the Pleistocene such as at the Aubrey site (41DN479) (Ferring
2001). This chapter reviews previous archaeological investigations in the floodplain of the West
Fork of the Trinity River in the Dallas area as they have a bearing upon the potential for finding
buried prehistoric sites in the study location.
Prehistoric Native American settlement in North Central Texas began at least 10,000 years ago
as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points and radiocarbon dated site
deposits at the Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957) and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring
2001). Evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation in the Upper Trinity River is generally limited to
surface finds of Clovis, Dalton, Plainview, Midland, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff projectile point
types (Prikryl 1990; Byers 2003). The most common types found are Plainview and Dalton,
suggesting that this region may have been a cultural hinterland used by both the western
Plainview culture and eastern Dalton culture (Byers 2003). The presence of exotic lithic
resources indicates that these early people traveled a territory where higher quality lithics were
available or the people were involved in a system of raw material exchange. These early people
hunted now-extinct large game, but also foraged off the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from as early as about 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late
as A.D. 700. Archaic populations lived throughout North Central Texas, but particularly along
the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather foods and resources.
Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are artifacts commonly found at
Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic populations continued making and using exotic cherts for dart
points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics, Uvalde Gravels, for
chipped stone tools. Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or ridges that overlook
the Trinity River and its various tributaries. Smaller lithic scatters have been recorded in upland
areas throughout the area. Few Archaic sites have been thoroughly studied.
Prikryl (1990) divides the Late Prehistoric into two phases for this region (at ca. 1200 A.D.)
based on projectile point types and changes in raw material frequencies. Late Prehistoric I is

generally represented by heat-treated quartzite and expanding-stemmed arrow points, whereas
Late Prehistoric II saw an increased use of chert, suggesting an increase of mobility or the
expansion of trade networks. Prikryl (1990) suggests that the climate was drier during the Late
Prehistoric II and bison-hunting appears to have become the dominant subsistence strategy at this
time. There is a marked influence from Plains cultures on lithic tool assemblages found in North
Central Texas dating to this period, with projectile points, scrapers, knives, and drills present
here that are seen throughout the Southern Plains (Prikryl 1990:80). The presence of bisonscapula hoes and a bison tibia digging stick, as were found at the Lewisville site, seems to
suggest an increase in horticulture or, at least, its first appearance. This concept is supported by
the presence of sites along sandy terraces instead of the floodplain area where Late Prehistoric I
sites are found.
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general abandonment of
the North Central Texas area based on an absence of sites with trade goods that might have been
obtained from French, Spanish, or English traders (Skinner 1988). This interpretation is tied to a
general drying trend and attempts to factor in negative information generated by professional and
avocational archaeologists who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region.
There is very little evidence of historic-era Native American occupation anywhere in Dallas
County, although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800s.
Anglo-American settlers in the early 1800s were the first non-natives to settle in North Central
Texas. Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, indigenous inhabitants continued
to maintain a presence in the region. The primary Native Americans in the region during 18thcentury were the Anadarkos, a Caddoan group, who had migrated to the county after the Texas
Revolution and settled in villages along the Trinity River (Campbell 2010; Maxwell 2016). The
Anadarkos were forcibly removed to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma, in 1859.
Dallas County was officially formed by order of the state legislature in 1846. For most of the
history of the North Texas area, the West Fork region has been used as range and crop land
(Handbook of Texas 2010). With the construction of railroads, Dallas became a business and
trading center for the region. After the 1920s, the county became less rural and more urban, as
manufacturing became the primary source of employment (Maxwell 2016). The years of the
Great Depression and World War II accelerated these changes, as the number of farms declined
and defense factories replaced jobs for young people from rural areas. Today, North Central
Texas is a growing area. The expansion of Dallas and Fort Worth due to the ever-increasing
number of industries coming into the area has extended the suburbs and retirement communities
are also on the rise.
Previous Investigations
A review of the Texas Historical Commissionâs Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) yielded one
prehistoric site (41DL246) that was previously recorded as near the current project area, and
three more (41DL426, 41DL427, and 41DL60) were recorded within one mile (TASA 2016).
Additionally, several surveys were conducted near the project area and other prehistoric sites
have been found along the West Fork of the Trinity River. No historic sites have been recorded
near the study area.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL MONITORING OF THE MACARTHUR BLVD ROAD IMPROVEMENTS

Site 41DL246 is referred to as the MacArthur Blvd. site and it was tested in 1984 by staff
members from the Fort Worth District office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The site was
buried in the south bank of the West Fork channel and extends for a distance of 35 meters along
the riverbank. The cultural deposit was described as at least 60 centimeters thick and buried from
90 to 150 centimeters below the present ground surface. Excavation recovered mussel shells,
snail shells, burned bone, and fire-cracked rock.
In 2003, AR Consultants, Inc. recorded a prehistoric site (41DL426) on the north bank of the
West Fork approximately 270 meters southwest of the corner of the MacArthur Blvd bridge
crossing the river (Todd and Skinner 2003). Animal bone, mussel shell, burned rock, and burned
clay were uncovered during trenching. The cultural deposit was noted at a depth of
approximately 112 cmbs with a 20-40 cm thick horizon with no specific lenses or features. The
site was described as likely a small campsite that was abandoned after limited use.
Approximately 0.6 miles north of 41DL246 is 41DL427, a prehistoric site recorded in 2000
PBS&J during the Liggott-Norwood Monitoring Project (TASA 2016). The site is located on a
small rise within the floodplain of Bear Creek and consists of mussel shell and bone recovered
from bore holes at a depth anywhere between 0 to 100 cmbs. Due to the scope of the project,
further testing could not be conducted and no determination of site size could be made.
Site 41DL60, located less than one mile south of the study area, was recorded in 1936 and the
site deposit included mussel shells, projectile points, a âknifeâ [possibly a biface], and probable
deer bones. Little information is available about this site, other than its recorder described the
probable cultural classification as âCaddoan.â
The following described archaeological sites and investigations are farther from the project area,
but may be representative of archaeological potential due to similar settings. Site 41DL180,
approximately 1.2 miles west of the study area, was recorded in 1974 and scrapers, points and
lithics were found on the surface. Site 41DL51 was recorded in 1940 and is located southwest of
the study area based on the presence of mussel shells and flint artifacts. Very little additional
information is available about sites 41DL51 and 180. Upstream on Bear Creek, north of the
current study area, Sue Linder-Linsley (2000) surveyed 78 acres of apparently disturbed land at
Irvingâs Running Bear Park and found no evidence of prehistoric occupation. Downstream, along
a cut-off meander of the West Fork, AR Consultants (Skinner, Kent and Trask 1998) excavated
13 trackhoe trenches but found no evidence of prehistoric occupation. AR Consultants, Inc. also
conducted an archaeological reconnaissance of four areas for the creation of wetland mitigation
banks (Todd and Skinner 2002). Despite intensive investigation, no cultural materials were found
in the survey areas. One site, however, that consisted of mussel shell, fire-cracked rock and bone
that was approximately 100 meters long and 3 meters below the surface, was found eroding from
the bank of the West Fork outside one of the survey areas.
Several other surveys and sites have been conducted along the West Fork, including the Rough
Green site (Skinner and Caran 1997), investigations by the Archaeology Research Program
(ARP) of Mercyhurst College of two recorded sites (41TR141 and 142) east of FM 157 in the
West Fork floodplain (Shaunessy et al. 1994), Ferringâs (1994b) survey of River Legacy Park
that recorded sites 41TR143 through 146, and the recording of 41TR174 by Geo-Marine, Inc.

(Burson et al. 2000). Typical findings in West Fork prehistoric sites have been deeply buried
deposits of mussel shell, animal bone, lithic artifacts, and fire-cracked rock.
The 1920 Dallas County Soil map, the 1936 Dallas County general highway map, the 1958
Dallas 7.5â USGS map, and historic aerial images from 1953, 1968, 1982 and 1989 were all
reviewed for potential historic sites. No historic buildings were observed when evaluating
historic maps and aerial photographs. However, the authors noted that 1953-1989 aerial
photographs show the river as meandering and narrow. Post-2001 aerials show the river as wide
and flowing straight north along MacArthur Blvd. Riprap along the east bank of the West Fork
appears in the aerials post-2001 (Figure 2). These observations suggest that the river was likely
channelized at some point between 1989 and 2001, possibly due to the river encroaching on
MacArthur Blvd as the river naturally began to cut off the meander to form an oxbow lake. Such
channelization would have likely disturbed the natural stratigraphy of the soils and destroyed any
cultural deposits if they were present.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on research conducted prior to survey, two hypotheses were developed. The first is that
there is high potential for encountering prehistoric archaeological sites within the riverâs
floodplain. Construction is occurring within or near the boundaries of previously recorded site
41DL246, which was identified between 90 and 150 cmbs, and there is the possibility of finding
other deeply buried deposits based on other work near the current project area. However, it is
possible that all deeply buried prehistoric deposits have been destroyed in this location by river
channelization in the 90s. The second hypothesis was that it is unlikely that historic cultural
resources would be found in the floodplain as no structures were identified within the project
area on historic maps or aerials and because it is unlikely that such structures would be located in
a floodplain setting. It is possible that trash scatters or isolated artifacts may be encountered, in
part because of the project areaâs location along MacArthur Blvd.
Methodology
Field personnel observed the excavation of trenches with a track hoe. As the trenches were dug,
personnel inspected the walls, floors, and back dirt. Photographs were taken during the
monitoring using a 16.0 megapixel digital camera. The monitored segment was recorded with a
handheld Garmin GPSmap 64st receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the monitoring activities and what
was found. Conclusions derived from the monitoring close the chapter.
Monitoring
A total of two interconnected trenches were excavated totaling 53.2 m (Figure 3). The first
trench ran east-west from the west side of the new location of MacArthur Blvd. to just above the
water table of the West Fork for a total of 28.7 m. The second trench ran southwest-northeast for
approximately 24.5 meters connecting to the second trench at about its midpoint. Both trenches
were approximately 4 meters wide at surface level, but no more than a meter wide at their floors.
Benches were created approximately every 25-30 cm down the walls of the profile. From east to
west, the first trench was excavated to 2-4 m deep. The second trench was excavated to a depth
of 2 m. From east to west, the top 45-50 cm of the initial 15 m of the first trench cut through the
old MacArthur Blvd. right-of-way (ROW). In profile, this was a very dark grayish brown layer
intermixed with gravel (Figure 4). Below the old ROW, the trench revealed a 50-cm thick layer
of grayish brown clay loam. The B horizon was revealed approximately 1 mbs. A similar profile
was revealed in the second trench as it was excavated back into the old ROW (Figure 5).
The western 13.7 m of the first trench were excavated to a depth of 3-4 m. Prior to excavation of
this part of the trench, riprap was removed from along the bank. The top 2 m generally consisted
of mottled grayish brown and brown clay loams with some gravels and 20th century trash
intermixed. This was likely fill related to the construction of the old ROW. A mottled dark
grayish and olive brown deposit intermixed with clear glass was identified approximately 2 m
below the current ground surface in the north profile of the trench approximately 9 m east of the
river (Figures 6 and 7). The mottled nature of the clay and the presence of a clear glass trash lens
at that depth suggests that at least 2 m of artificial fill exists along the bank where it meets the
riprap. This may be the result of river channelization, though it is unclear. The B horizon
underlays this layer and is present down to the riverâs water table. No buried layers or prehistoric
features or artifacts were exposed during the monitoring of the trenches. The glass trash lens only
contained non-diagnostic clear glass which may have been deposited when the river was
channelized and the bank covered in riprap. No evidence of site 41DL246 was found in the
project area.

Conclusions
No sites or dateable features were identified during the monitoring of 53.2 m of the MacArthur
Blvd. Road Improvements project. Additionally, no prehistoric artifacts were found despite the
potential presence of site 41DL246 within the project area. Therefore, no significant cultural
resources are known to occur in the monitored areas and ARC concludes that the construction of
the roadway did not negatively impact any cultural resources. At this time, no further work is
recommended in conjunction with the continued construction associated with the MacArthur
Blvd. Road Improvements near the reported location of site 41DL246.
