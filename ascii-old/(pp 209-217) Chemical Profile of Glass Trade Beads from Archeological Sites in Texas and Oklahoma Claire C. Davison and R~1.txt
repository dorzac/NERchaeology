ABSTRACT
The results of x-ray fluorescence analysis of 18th and 19th century glass
trade beads are presented. A chemical profile that appears characteristic
of the beads is discussed.

Fifty-two glass trade beads from 18th and early 19th century archeological sites in Texas and Oklahoma have been analyzed by x-ray
fluorescence (Table 1). The sites are, in chronological order, Womack,
Gilbert, Vinson, Spanish Fort (Ayers Farm), and Devil’s Canyon;
probable dates for the sites are shown in Table 2. Although the degree
of certainty varies, all are identified as Wichita Indian sites.
X-ray fluorescence, or any other method of chemical analysis, sheds
light on the chemical ingredients of the artifact analyzed. A knowledge of the chemical ingredients can, in turn, serve as a basis for
formulating other hypotheses; for example, hypotheses of artifact
groupings (Davison, Giauque and Clark, 1971:651), trade routes,
points of origin, artifact dating or site dating. For glass trade beads
such studies aim particularly towards the ultimate ability to specify
and date the manufacturing origins of the beads, to recognize all
beads of the same origin-- this may not be apparent visually-- and to
depict the factors that brought them to the archaeological sites. Such
studies are in their infancy, and it was in the spirit of furthering them
that we undertook the present pilot study of beads from Wichita sites.
The present study found that certain chemical features which are
significant from the glassmaking point of view are characteristic of
these beads throughout the time period represented. These four features are consistent with the dating of the beads. They constitute the
chemical profile of the beads and are as follows:
1. Antimony is in use. Antimony (Sb) is a glassmaker’s additive,
used as an opacifying agent and also as a decolorizer. The study of
glass history indicates that this element came into regular use by
glassmakers in about the 17th to 18th century A.D. (Turner and
Rooksby 1962; Neri 1662:82; Kunckel 1756:86). It had been used in
antiquity, but apparently not in the medieval period (Turner and
Rooksby, 1962; Sayre, 1963:263). Before the 17th to 18th centuries, tin
seems to have been the conventional opacifying agent. However, after

antimony came into use, the use of tin did not cease. Thus the presence of intentionally added antimony can aid in dating glass beads,
although in this case the beads were already dated archeologically
and the evidence from antimony merely serves to confirm the dating
of the beads.
Antimony (or tin) may be considered intentionally added in glass
when its concentration is in the tenth of percent range or higher.
Besides being added intentionally, antimony may enter glass through
cullet (scrap glass, which is usually included in new batches). Therefore in an antimony-using tradition one might expect to find that
glasses which do not seem to contain intentionally added antimony
still contain considerably more antimony than tin, and vice versa for
tin-using traditions. By observing the ranges of concentration in
Table 1, one can see which beads probably contain antimony as an
intended additive. Where it may be considered unintended, it is still
usually higher than the tin, which was almost never detected (Table
1).
2. Manganese is used to achieve black. There are several ways to
achieve a black "color" in glass. In these beads the glassmakers
apparently used manganese (Mn) in such high concentration that the
purple color given by this element is dark enough to appear black. If
the black beads are held to a strong light, the purple tint can usually be
seen.
3. Lead glasses occur. Lead (Pb) glasses are one ofthemain types of
glass, containing tens of percent lead oxide. In the lead glasses
analyzed here, the amount of lead was not determined, beyond the
fact that it was very high. It is estimated to be some tens of percent in
the high-lead beads.
4. Bismuth is often present in beads colored by cobalt. Presumably
the bismuth (Bi) is associated with the cobalt (Co) mineral, an association which is not unusual mineralogically. However, the presence of
bismuth is not generally characteristic of most of the glass beads
encountered in the experience of one of us (C.D.) except for the set of
beads here discussed.

Other remarks. The beads were also analyzed for iron, nickel,
copper, zinc, arsenic, rubidium, strontium, and, in some cases,
barium. These elements show no remarkable features comparable to
the four listed above. The iron is usually in the tenths of percent range
of concentration; nickel was rarely detected; copper, when used as an
additive, was in the tenths of percent range of concentration, and
otherwise usually was present in the hundredths of percent range;
zinc was usually present in the hundredths of percent range; arsenic
was often detected in the hundredths of percent range, particularly in
cobalt blue beads but also in various other colors; rubidium was
occasionally detected in the hundredths of percent range of concentration; and strontium was consistently present in the hundredths of
percent range. Trace amounts of barium were noted in some, but not
all, of the black and purple beads.
Sub-periods within the span of some 130 years represented by these
beads are not distinguished on the basis of the present chemical data.
It may well be possible to distinguish sub-periods with chemical
analyses more extensive and precise than these. Sub-periods have
been distinguished on the basis of (a) chronological changes in the
frequency of bead styles and (b) documentary evidence, in another
report (Harris and Harris 1967:156-158).
Of the above four features only two might be detected by the nonchemist bead consumer. These are the use of manganese in black,
which gives it a purplish tint, and the use of lead glass, which makes
the lead glass beads heavier than other beads of the same size. The use
of antimony rather than tin and the presence of trace bismuth are not
detectable by the senses.
It seems likely that the two undetectable features and perhaps all
four reflect the practices of the manufacturers (probably European)

rather than the preferences of the consumers. It is hoped that future
investigations may shed light on whether the chemical profile outlined here may be typical of 18th century glass trade bead production
generally, or may be diagnostic of a particular manufacturing tradition, and to what extent, if any, it may be influenced by consumer
preference.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The x-ray fluorescence analysis reported here was carried out in the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, California. W~ thank the laboratory, particularly Robert
D. Giauque, for making the facilities available.
