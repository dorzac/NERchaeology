ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of two reserve pits at existing well pad sites and a
segment of a proposed gas pipeline on the Eastham Unit of the Texas State Prison
Farm in southwest Houston County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley
Research Associates on September 3 and 15, 2010 under Antiquities Permit 5746
for Navidad Resources, LLC of Tyler, Texas. The total area investigated consisted
of 0.34 acre. One prehistoric site was identified and recorded as 41HO268. This
site is believed to represent a Caddo occupation of a site that was inhabited
sometime after A.D. 1300 and A.D. 1400 as this is the time when such sites were
mostly likely occupied in this part of the Trinity River basin. No diagnostic lithics
were recovered, so the only estimate of a date is based on the ceramics. Because
of the limited data collected due to a narrow pipeline corridor, the east-west axis of
this site is not known. This site appears to have research potential, and it is
recommended that it be avoided by the proposed new construction. If this is not
possible, it is recommended that additional shovel tests be excavated to determine
the site boundaries. Significance testing may be necessary in order to assess its
eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or as a State
Archeological Landmark. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical
Commission, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State
Library, Navidad Resources, LLC, the Eastham Unit, and Brazos Valley Research
Associates. The artifacts and records have been placed in permanent curation at
the Sam Houston Memorial Museum in Huntsville, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
Navidad Resources, LLC plans to begin drilling at two existing well sites
on the Eastham Unit in southwest Houston County (Figure 1). The two well sites
are classified as re-entry wells because they have been drilled in the past, and
the client plans to return to these wells for additional drilling. The only new
subsurface disturbance consists of reserve pits at each well. These pits will be
excavated to a depth of three feet and will be placed within the footprint of the
well sites. The two wells involved are 2-1 (Marr 3) and B-1 (Roundup 1). The
area needed for the Marr 3 reserve pit is 10 feet by 40 feet, and the area needed
for the Roundup 1 reserve pit is 30 feet by 150 feet. In addition, several pipelines
are planned to connect these wells and others in the area. At the time of this
survey, the only pipeline that had been staked was planned to originate at the
southeast corner of the B-1 well and continue to the south. The route of the other
pipelines had not been determined. For this reason, they are not depicted on
any of the maps in this report. Due to the identification of site 41HO268 within
the footprint of the pipeline that is proposed to connect the B1 well with another
well site to the south, this phase of the project has been abandoned until an
alternate route can be found or a decision is made regarding additional work at
the site. The project area is depicted on the USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangle
Sand Ridge (3195-212) (Figure 2). The reviewing state agency is the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division.The original cellblock is still standing,
and it is the subject of the photograph on the cover of this report.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120).
Fenneman subdivides this province according to the age of the geological
formations (Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly
and situated within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an
area characterized by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that
are acid sandy loams or sands. The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather
is considered to be predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Houston County is
39.21 inches. A January minimum temperature of 42 degrees Fahrenheit and a
July maximum temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit combine to produce a
growing season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:180). The altitude varies
from 200-400 feet. At the time of this survey the surface of the reserve pits varied
from being covered with low grass to cleared due to well construction. The footprint
of the proposed gas pipeline was covered in pasture. The entire project area is
located within soils described by the soil survey for Houston County as FreestoneDerly complex, 0-2 percent slopes (Steptoe 2002). Freestone soils are found on
toe slopes, and Derly soils are found on low areas between mounds. In a typical
profile, Freestone soils are moderately acid fine sandy loam that turns into sandy
clay between 21 and 24 inches (subsoil), and Derly soils are moderately acid fine
sandy loam that turns into sandy clay between 12 and 23 inches (subsoil). These
are deep soils that are moderately well drained (Freestone) and poorly drained
(Derly). Flooding is not listed as a hazard particular to this complex. Permeability
is slow (Freestone) to very slow (Derly).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Houston County is
situated within the Northeast Texas archeological study region (Figure 3). Since it
is on the fringe of the area referred to as Northeast Texas, it probably shares some
cultural ties with the adjacent Southeast Texas region. In 1985, according to a
statistical overview published by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al.
1985:114), there were only nine documented prehistoric sites in the county. The
archaeological potential of Houston County is reflected in part by the increasing
number of recorded sites found as a result of numerous cultural resource
management studies. As a result of these investigations, the number of recorded
sites now stands at over 260 (TARL site files). Small and large area surveys have
been conducted in Houston County, and the majority of these did not locate
archaeological sites. According to the TARL site records, 87 archaeological
surveys and related projects have been carried out in Houston County, and only 24
discuss archaeological sites or they resulted in the identification of previously
unrecorded sites. Most of the areas investigated in the county were associated
with oil and gas projects (n=60), and James E. Corbin performed the majority of
these studies. Other projects include two field schools sponsored by the University
of Texas at Austin in 1977 and 1982, water distribution lines, transmission lines, a
fiber optic cable project, the proposed Bedias Reservoir, the Tennessee Colony
Reservoir, a city park, inventories and survey of the Davy Crocket National Forest
and Mission Tejas State Park. These studies date to the 1970s (n=5), 1980s
(n=36), 1990s (n=39), and 2000s (n=4). Most of the early recorded sites were
documented by landowners and amateur archaeologists, and some of these are
potentially significant such as 41HO1 which was recorded by Edward B. Jelks in
1954 as a site containing glass beads, lead bullets, gun parts, arrow points, and
sherds. A second interesting site is 41HO6. Alex D. Krieger documented it in 1944
as a location where a small cannon was uncovered in 1940 during plowing of a field
by the landowner.
The nearest recorded site to the current project area is 41HO83. This site
was recorded by archaeologists from Southern Methodist University in 1976 as a
prehistoric site on a high bluff overlooking the Trinity River to the north on the
Eastham State Prison Farm. The site form contains very little information, but it
does state that the site is on or very near the location that William M. Sorrow
(1973) gives for the town of Santisima Trinidad de Salcedo (1806-1813).
Artifacts recovered include chips, flakes, bone, burned clay, and a possible
hearth that were exposed by a deep erosional cut. The site was determined to
be not significant, and no further work was recommended.

In addition to the three previous studies by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (Moore 2008a, Moore 2008b, Moore and Baxter 2010), our research
only documented one other survey conducted on Eastham State Prison Farm
land. This study was carried out by Timothy K. Perttula (1997) in 1997, when he
surveyed two pastures and recorded sites 41HO183 â 41HO190. The eight sites
recorded consist of seven prehistoric campsites and one historic cemetery
containing two graves dating to 1843 and 1852. Six of the prehistoric campsites
are located on the first terrace above the Trinity River, and the seventh site is
located on a pimple mound. Three of the prehistoric campsites date to the Late
Prehistoric period of Texas prehistory based on the presence of ceramics and
arrow points. Each of these sites is described on the site form as having
potential for being designated as a State Archeological Landmark. No statement
regarding their eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
appears on the site forms. Four of the prehistoric campsites lacked diagnostic
artifacts and could not be assigned to a temporal period. These sites were
considered to be not significant, and no further work was recommended. All of
the prehistoric campsites were found in sandy soils and were examined through
shovel testing and/or backhoe trenching. This investigation was performed south
of the current project area and is depicted on the 7.5â USGS topographic
quadrangle Baker Lake. Also on the Eastham Unit is site 41HO5. This site was
recorded by Mr. and Mrs. Sam Barnes in 1967 based on information provided by
prison guard Lee Runner. Arrow points and pottery were reportedly found in the
area. At this site, a flintlock rifle with flint in place was found in a plowed field.
Other smaller projects in the county have been conducted by private archaeological
contract firms, state agencies, and amateur archaeologists.

CULTURE SEQUENCE
The area referred to by archaeologists as Northeast Texas is often linked
with the prehistoric Caddo by many archaeologists. While it is true that they did
inhabit this part of Texas, there were other non-Caddoan groups there as well.
The earliest indication of utilization of the area is found in the occasional surface
find of projectile points typically associated with the Paleo-Indians. The oldest
point types known for North America are Clovis and Folsom. These points were
used by the first Americans in their pursuit of mammoth, mastodon, and species
of bison that are now extinct. Although not much is known about their diet, plants
and other smaller animals were probably as important to the Paleo-Indians as an
occasional mammoth or other large animal. Sites with in situ deposits dating to this
period are few in number in Northeast Texas and adjacent areas. The San Patrice
point is viewed as a transitional type between the Paleo-Indian period and the
emerging Archaic Period. Unlike Clovis and Folsom points, sites with San Patrice
points are known to occur in East Texas such as 41MQ41 in Montgomery County
(Shafer and Stearns 1975). Descriptions of the projectile point types discussed in
this report are described in Turner and Hester (1985) and Suhm and Jelks (1962).
According to Coleman et al. (1984:11), the Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas
is thought to have lasted about 4000 years (10,000 B.C. to 6000 B.C.). Bryant and
Shafer (1977:20) believe that an emphasis on megafauna exploitation could not
have prevailed in the eastern part of the state because of environmental variation.
They doubt that big game hunting would have been economically sound as a major
subsistence pattern in any of the parkland and woodland areas of East Texas
where the species of big game were probably not dispersed or not present in large
numbers. The Archaic period is generally defined as the period following the
extinction of Pleistocene mega fauna during which small bands of hunters and
gatherers roamed the countryside in search of plants and animals. During this time
the overall population increased as evidenced by a greater number of sites.
According to Dippel (2001:4-2), the Archaic in East Texas lasted from 6000 B.C. to
200 B.C. Duffield (1963) views the Early Archaic as a transitional period from
Paleo-Indian to Archaic times, based on a marked change in technology rather than
subsistence. Coleman et al. (1984) believe that these changes may have been the
result of population increases that produced a greater emphasis on territoriality and
a greater reliance on the inferior local lithic resources. Two projectile point types
commonly found at Archaic sites are Gary and Kent, although others are known as
well. During this time, there was an increase in the population of the local groups,
and two major changes occurred. These were the introduction and use of ceramics
and the bow-and-arrow, and they are the hallmarks of the Late Prehistoric period in
the area. Some archaeologists (Kotter 1981) refer to this time as the Neo-Archaic.
Kotter (1981:33) believes few, if any, changes in subsistence strategies occurred
during this time. The time span for the Late Prehistoric period varies according to
research by different archaeologists. Shafer (1975:9-10) dates this period from the
advent of ceramics (200 B.C.) to the beginning of the Historic period (A.D. 1680).

8

Late Prehistoric sites are greater in number than those of the earlier Archaic
and are found both along mainstream riverine and tributary environments indicating
the same localities that were exploited during the Late Archaic Period were utilized.
Pottery found at Late Prehistoric sites in the area consists of decorated and
undecorated types with undecorated sandy-paste types being the most common.
Other forms of temper include bone and/or grog. Caddo area ceramics were often
elaborately decorated, and these can sometimes be dated. During the early part of
this period, the arrow points known to have been used were Catahoula and Friley.
These sites often contain Gary and Kent dart points as well, and some very small
versions of these types may have been used as arrow points during this transition.
Later, other types (from oldest to youngest) such as Alba, Bonham, Scallorn,
Perdiz, and Cliffton were utilized. Pottery found at Late Prehistoric sites in the area
consists of decorated and undecorated types with undecorated sandy-paste types
being the most common. Sites during this period are typically found on sandy
ridges and terraces in close proximity to a dependable source of water. In some
cases, sites may be found deeply buried in the floodplains of major streams.
Because of the nomadic nature of the Indians in this area, it is difficult to describe a
site as permanent. Many of the same landforms occupied during the Archaic were
utilized in Late Prehistoric times, as evidenced by sites containing components of
both periods. Many of the early projectile points were made from chert that was not
available in East Texas. These points were either brought to the area as finished
specimens or the raw material was used as a trade item. Artifacts of non-local
material believed by some archaeologists to represent âtrade blanksâ have been
found in various parts of the state including nearby Walker County. Later, as
groups became adapted to East Texas, local materials were extensively used, and
these include quartzite, jasper, opal, and silicified wood. These materials were
used to manufacture various tools such as scrapers, knives, awls, and drills.
Flakes were often retouched and used for cutting. The presence of silicified wood
at sites in Houston County is a common occurrence as this was a readily available
local resource.
Caddo sites are found throughout Northeast Texas, and artifacts identified
as Caddo have been found in sites away from their Northeast Texas homeland.
One example is 41BZ102 in Brazos County where Caddoan pottery sherds,
arrow points, and a four-beveled knife were found. From 1684 to 1687, French
explorer Henri Joutel traveled throughout the Southeast and kept a diary of his
encounters with the local Indians (Foster 1998). In this diary, he mentions the
Caddo as a nomadic group who followed the buffalo when possible. Since fourbeveled knives are believed by some archaeologists to have been a tool used in
the processing of buffalo, site 41BZ102 may be an example of this behavior by a
Caddoan group whose main camp was somewhere in Northeast Texas. Joutelâs
diary (Foster 1998) has numerous references to the exploitation of bison by the
Caddo., and his notes document the use of the area between the lower Brazos
and Colorado as a Cenis (Caddo) hunting ground.

9

One of the more impressive aspects of Caddo sites is the presence of
earthen mounds, and these can vary in size and function. The nearest known
Caddoan village and mound complex to the current project area is the George C.
Davis site (41CE19) in adjacent Cherokee County. This site has been the
subject of several studies with the most notable being the first effort by H. Perry
Newell and Alex D. Krieger (1949) in the 1940s and later work by Dee Ann Story
(1981b). The Davis site was a major regional center that was probably inhabited
for 500 years, beginning as early as A.D. 780 according to Story. One of the
mounds was used as a burial place for important members of the village, and the
other mounds supported structures. When the Europeans visited the area in the
18th Century, this site had been abandoned and the local Caddo were residing in
widely dispersed hamlets and villages. According to the diary by Joutel (Foster
1998), one of the main Caddo villages was located on San Pedro Creek in
Houston County. Timothy K. Perttula (personal communication, September 19,
2010) believes that the Caddo stated that the Trinity River area was an area that
was not regularly occupied.
Detailed summaries of Northeast Texas prehistory and adjacent Southeast
Texas have been prepared by various researchers with the most notable examples
being the works by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), Suhm et al. (1954), Aten (1983),
Story, et al. (1990), and Ricklis (2004). William A. Martin compiled a bibliography
for the Northeastern Region of Texas for the THC in 1990 (Martin 1990), and
William E. Moore (1989) compiled a bibliography of adjacent Southeast Texas in
1989. Timothy K. Perttula is one of the leading authorities on the Texas Caddo,
and the interested reader is advised to consult some of his major works. They are
patterns of Prehistoric Lithic Raw Material Utilization I the Caddoan Area: The
Western Gulf Coastal Plain (Perttula 1984), The Caddo Nation: Archaeological and
Ethnohistorical Perspectives (Perttula 1992), Caddoan Area Archaeology since
1990 (Perttula 1996), and The Prehistoric and Caddoan Archaeology of the
Northeastern Texas Pineywoods (Perttula 2004).

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to entering the field, the records at TARL and the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas were checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological
sites in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting
work in Houston County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of
prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. The major report documenting
fieldwork in the area was written by Archeological and Environmental Consultants
of Austin (Perttula and Prikryl 1997). Other reports reviewed include three projects
conducted at the Eastham Unit by BVRA (Moore 2008a, 2008b and Moore and
Baxter 2010).
Field Survey
The area was investigated under the supervision of J. Randy Ferguson with
assistance from Rachel Goings on September 3, 2010 and Christal McMillion and
Jeremy Stewart on September 15, 2010. The current project area was investigated
by shovel tests and a backhoe trench at the Marr 3 (2-1) well site, shovel tests at
the Roundup 1 (B-1) well site, and shovel tests along a portion of the proposed
pipeline. The soil excavated from the tests was screened using Â¼ inch hardware
cloth, and the results of the shovel tests were documented on a shovel test log
(Appendix I). A profile of the trench was drawn in the field along with photographs
of the trench (Appendix II).
The proposed Roundup 1 well is located 180 meters south of Negro Creek
and 3260 meters east of the Marr 3 well site. The size of the reserve pit is 30 feet
by 150 feet, and it will extend to a depth of three feet. At the time of this survey, the
surface had been cleared of all vegetation and consisted of bare earth and gravel
from the well pad. The subsurface was examined by three shovel tests spaced
evenly across the pit (Figure 4). The new pipeline was planned to originate from
the southeast corner of the well and continue to another well to the south. During
the first visit, two positive shovel tests (6 and 7) had been excavated along the area
that had been staked for the gas pipeline. The client was advised that a site had
been identified, but its southern boundary was not known. Per the request of the
client, additional shovel tests (n=13) were dug within the footprint of the proposed
gas pipeline to determine if the site would be found significant and perhaps cause
them to choose a different route. Tests were excavated to the north and south for a
distance of 210 meters until two consecutive negative tests were excavated in each
direction. No tests were dug to the east and west because the client had no plans
to disturb the subsurface in these areas. The location of the shovel tests are
depicted on the map of site 41HO268 in the Results and Conclusions section of this
report.

The proposed Marr 3 well is located 120 meters south of Negro Creek and
460 meters southeast of its junction with the Trinity River. The size of the pit is 10
feet by 40 feet, and the depth of the reserve pit will be three feet. At the time of this
survey, the surface consisted of bare earth adjacent to the previously constructed
well pad that was surfaced with rock and gravel. The surface was visually
inspected, and the subsurface was examined by two shovel tests and one backhoe
trench. The shovel tests were dug at each end of the proposed pit, and the
backhoe trench was dug in the center (Figure 5).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Archeological
Sites Atlas revealed no sites have been recorded in the project area, and a
professional archaeologist had not previously examined either of the two well sites
or the segment of proposed pipeline that was the focus of this study. The project
area is located on land owned by the Eastham State Prison Farm that was
established in 1917. In the past, the prison land had been used primarily for
agricultural purposes, and the major crops grown were cotton and corn. Prior to the
acquisition of the property by the Texas prison system, the project area was part of
the Eastham Plantation (Mack Currie personal communication). A search of the
Internet and the Handbook of Texas failed to reveal any information regarding this
plantation except that its cemetery is located somewhere on prison property. The
subsurface examination at the Roundup 1 well and along the pipeline revealed a
deep mantle of sandy loam and loamy sand mixed at times with sandy clay. The
shovel tests and backhoe trench at the Marr 3 well site encountered clay at the
surface. Since the reserve pit will only extend to a depth of three feet, it is unlikely
that a significant archaeological site is present in this area.
During the first visit to the Roundup 1 well, two shovel tests were excavated
within the proposed gas pipeline, and both were positive with two flakes in each
test. On the return trip, additional tests were excavated to delineate the north-south
boundaries of this site. No attempt was made to extend the boundary to the east
and west since these areas were outside the area to be disturbed should the client
proceed with construction of the pipeline. The artifact count was increased from
four flakes to thirty-eight flakes, three fragments of pottery, and pieces of burned
bone and some charcoal in eleven positive tests. This area was recorded with
TARL as site 41HO268, and it has been identified as a Late Prehistoric site with a
Caddoan component that dates to sometime after A.D. 1300 to A.D. 1400 based on
ceramic analysis of the two decorated sherds. This site is situated on a sandy rise
at an elevation of 170 feet above mean sea level. This landform is 120 meters
south of Negro Creek. The soils consist of deep sandy loam and loamy sand, often
mixed with sandy clay. In the main site area, shovel tests were dug through sandy
soil to a depth of 100 cm in most cases without encountering clay. Sixteen shovel
tests were dug during the site delineation, and the north-south axis of the site was
determined to be at least 210 meters. The east-west axis is not known because no
shovel tests were excavated in these directions since the pipeline will be restricted
to a very narrow corridor of two feet or less. Although no evidence of a prehistoric
site was found during the shovel testing of the reserve pit at Roundup 1, it is likely
that elements of site 41HO268 are present beneath the surface of this well pad. A
preliminary analysis of the artifacts recovered from this site identified a rather large
sample of small flakes that are viewed by the lithics analyst to represent activities
associated with tool refurbishing. He believes that the site was probably occupied
on a limited or seasonal basis and may have functioned as a site where local
resources were exploited.

15

The raw material present in the debitage sample is heavily weighted towards
silicified wood (n=25), a material that was commonly used in this part of the state.
The other flakes were made from chert (n=9), and quartzite (n=4). These small
flakes were primarily created using the pressure flaking technique, and some are
burned. Complete flakes and flake fragments were present. Three sandy-paste
ceramic body sherds were recovered, and they consist of one plain sherd and two
sherds with a decorative motif. One has two indentions that were created by the
use of fingernail punctations in the wet paste. The other sherd was decorated by
incising shallow parallel lines into the wet paste. The debitage was found in all but
one of the positive tests, and the ceramics were found in two tests in the
approximate center of the site very close to the eastern perimeter of the Roundup 1
well site. The depth of artifacts at this site varies from 10 cm (Level 2) to 100 cm
(Level 10) with the majority found in levels 2, 4, and 6 (20 cm â 60 cm). The
ceramics were found in levels 4 and 5. Other items recovered include unidentified
charred objects, shatter, possible bone, and a pebble. One clear glass fragment
was found in Level 2, but this is viewed as intrusive and not representative of a
historic component. The burned rock suggests the possibility of hearths, and the
possible bone supports this hypothesis. Should charcoal be present in sufficient
quantities, it may be possible to date this site through radiocarbon dating. The
analyst believes that the absence of large flakes can be used to argue that this site
was used on a temporary basis often referred to by some archaeologists as a
âtemporary hunting camp.â In summary, this may be a large prehistoric site that
has research potential worthy of listing in the National Register of Historic Places or
designation as a State Archeological Landmark. The site map (Figure 6) appears
below, and a view of the area adjacent to the Roundup 1 well site appears as
Figure 7. A detailed list of artifacts recovered appears as Appendix III to this report.
The shovel test log only presents the basic information regarding cultural materials.

RECOMMENDATIONS
One prehistoric site was found as a result of this survey. It is recommended
that this area be avoided. Although it is possible that elements of site 41HO268
may be present beneath the surface of the Roundup 1 (2-1) well site, no evidence
of this site was found in this area as the three shovel tests dug in the reserve
footprint were negative. Therefore, it is recommended that the client be allowed to
proceed with the construction of the reserve pit in this area. Since the well will be
drilled in an area that has already been disturbed when it was constructed, drilling
should be allowed to proceed in this re-entry well. It is advised that the use of heavy
equipment be restricted to those areas where no evidence of the site was found.
Clay soil was encountered at the surface of well site 2-1 (Marr 3), and no cultural
materials were encountered. It is recommended that construction of the reserve pit
in this area also be allowed to proceed with no restrictions. Any future construction
in the vicinity of site 41HO268 must be delayed until the area is investigated by a
professional archaeologist since only a portion of the site has been delineated. If
avoidance of those areas where the site is known to occur, it is recommended that
Phase II testing be conducted to determine the research potential of this site. This
survey was conducted in accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as
outlined by the Texas Historical Commission.

BACKHOE TRENCH DESCRIPTION
Backhoe Trench 1 was excavated by J. Randy Ferguson in the center of
reserve pit Marr 3 (2-1). At the time of this investigation, the area was cleared of
vegetation, and the surface was bare earth. The size of this trench was 93
centimeters wide, 1.90 centimeters long, and 100 centimeters deep. It was
oriented at 20ï° north-northeast. Two zones were recognized. The UTM
coordinates taken at the trench location are 2 45 969 (Easting) and 34 33 079
(Northing) using North American Datum 27. Zone I consisted of clay loam and
clay from the surface to 46 centimeters (10YR 3/3). The soil in this zone at the
time of this investigation was dry and very hard. Modern historic trash was
present in the upper 18 centimeters. Zone II consisted of dark grayish-brown
clay (10YR 3/4) from the clearly distinct boundary between the two zones to a
depth of 100 centimeters. Other than the modern historic trash, no artifacts or
features were observed.

APPENDIX V
Lithic Analysis
by
William A. Dickens

Analysis of Lithic Debitage from 41HO268
A Phase I archaeological survey at the Eastham Unit on property owned
by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Houston County resulted in the
recovery of 43 pieces of lithic debitage and three ceramic sherds. No formal
tools, blanks, or preforms were found. These specimens were found in ten
shovel tests at depths of 10 cm to 90 cm. The ceramics were analyzed by
Timothy K. Perttula, and his findings appear in Appendix VI to this report.
The composition of the debitage from site 41HO268 consists of 24
specimens of silicified wood (56%), 14 specimens made from local chert gravels
(33%), 4 pieces of quartzite (10%), and 1 artifact of jasper (1%). Chert, quartzite,
and jasper are materials commonly found within the local gravel deposits of the
Trinity River and other major streams in the area. Silicified wood is abundant in
the area and adjoining regions that have been subjected to erosional activities as
well as within the local gravel deposits.
The debitage was found in fairly consistent numbers in all levels, with the
greatest amount in Level 4 (30-40 cm). Although no debitage was found in levels
8 and 9, two specimens were found in Level 10 (90-100 cm). The flakes are
small in size. In order to determine an accurate measurement of their size in
millimeters, the flakes were passed through a series of nested screens. This
resulted in the finding that two flakes are size grade 5 (17 mm), five are size
grade 6 (13 mm), seventeen are size grade 7 (6.3 mm), and 19 are size grade 8
(less than 6.3 mm).
The cortex found on most natural gravels was usually totally removed by
the time a formal tool (i.e., projectile point) was finished. The amount found on a
flake is usually viewed as an indication of the stage of manufacture. In some
cases tools may retain varying amounts of cortex, and this is also true of
projectile points in East Texas. No cortex was found on 39 flakes in the sample.
Three flakes retained a small amount of cortex, and only one flake was totally
covered.
The type of platform is a good indication of the type of edge preparation
performed that led to flake removal, and platforms vary from none present to
those that were carefully prepared and modified for the removal of specific types
of flakes. In this collection, the only platforms observed were plain (n=20) with
only the cortex having been removed. The remainder were either broken or
crushed.

The type of bulb of percussion is an indication of the type of percussor
used, and the percussor used can be either hard hammer (stone) or soft hammer
(antler, bone, or wood). Evidence that hard hammer percussion was used is
usually present as a prominent bulb on the ventral surface. In contrast, soft
hammer percussion usually results in a flat or diffuse ventral surface. In this
collection, thirteen flakes exhibited strong or slightly prominent bulbs of
percussion, and bulbs were missing or broken on sixteen flakes.
The majority of flakes showed no indication of heat-treating or any method
of thermal alteration, but seven specimens exhibited a change in color on both
surfaces. This is evidence that the heating occurred after the flake had been
removed from the blank. This is most evident in chert specimens. Since iron is a
mineral found in chert, the portion of the artifact where iron is present turns a
reddish color after exposure to heat.
The conclusion from this sample of debitage is that tool rejuvenation or
refurbishing was the primary activity at this site involving lithic materials. There is
no evidence that formal tools were manufactured at 41HO268. The type of
debitage present in the assemblage is consistent with re-sharpening or repair of
tools, as these activities typically result in the creation of large numbers of small
flakes. Both hard hammer and soft hammer percussors were used as evidenced
by the presence of the kinds of bulbs that result from these forms of percussion
and diffuse ventral surfaces. This type of maintenance is typical for many forms
of heavy use tools such as scrapers, knives, and choppers. Although formal
tools may be present at the site, their absence at this stage of analysis suggests
that the most likely site function was some sort of procurement activity designed
to exploit local resources. If the small number of lithic materials present in this
collection is an accurate depiction for the entire site, it is likely that 41HO268 was
an area that was used on a temporary or seasonal basis.

APPENDIX VI
Ceramic Analysis

Timothy K. Perttula

Analysis of Aboriginal Ceramic Sherds from 41HO268
Introduction
This report concerns the analysis of the recovered ceramic sherds from
41HO268, a prehistoric site in the Trinity River basin in the far western reaches
of East Texas. The analysis presented herein emphasizes the acquisition of
information on the technological and stylistic character of the aboriginal ceramic
sherds from the site. Of particular interest is the manufacture and production of
the ceramic vessels discarded at the sites as sherds, as determined from the
study of temper use, firing, and surface treatment as well as the stylistic
character of the few decorated sherds with the goal of assessing the place of the
pottery made and used at this site within the context of East Texas prehistoric
ceramic traditions and practices (Perttula 2010).
Detailed analysis of the three sherds from 41HO268 is based on
differences in temper, type of sherd, decoration (if present), surface treatment,
and firing conditions. Sherd cross-sections were inspected macroscopically and
with a 10-x hand lens to determine the character of the paste and its inclusions.
Determining the firing conditions is based on the identification of the firing core in
the sherd cross-sections and the identification of oxidation patterns as defined in
Teltser (1993:535-536, Figure 2a-h) and Perttula (2005).
More specifically, two principal attributes were employed in the analysis of
the ceramics from 41HO268. The first is temper, defined by Rice 1987:411) as
the deliberate and indeterminate materials found in the paste. The variety of
temper used consists of grog (crushed sherds), burned bone, hematite, and
âparticulate matters of some size.â The second principal attribute concerns
observations on ceramic sherd cross-sections to determine oxidation patterns
(Teltser 1993:Figure 2; Perttula 2005), namely the conditions under which a
vessel was fired and then cooled after firing. Finally, wall thickness was recorded
in millimeters using a vernier caliper along the mid-section of the sherd. With
respect to interior and exterior surface treatment on the sherds, the primary
methods of finishing the sherds was by smoothing. This method creates âa finer
and more regular surfaceâ¦[and] has a matte rather than a lustrous surfaceâ
(Rice 1987:138). Decorative techniques present in the small ceramic sherd
collection from 41HO268 include incising or combing done with a wood or bone
stick or dowel (or possibly a stiff frayed stick or bundle) passed across the still
wet exterior surface of unfired vessels and fingernail punctation, done by
impressing the fingernail into the wet unfired vessel surface.

Discussion of Sherds
The three sherds from 41HO268 were recovered from adjacent shovel
tests 10 and 11 on the east side of the B-1 (Roundup 1) Well Pad (see Figure 6
in report). They were found at depths of 30-50 cm below the existing ground
surface. Based on similarities and differences in temper use and decoration, it is
probable that the three sherds are from two different vessels; probably utility
ware jars used primarily for cooking. All three sherds are from vessels made
using the coiling method.
Sherds from Shovel Test 10
The plain body sherd found in Shovel Test 10 was found between 30 and
40 cm. It was fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open air, a
process that results in the interior surface exhibiting a thin oxidized band visible
on the inside of the sherd core. It is a sandy paste sherd that was tempered with
bone. The interior surface treatment is described as smoothed, and the
thickness of this specimen was measured at 7.7 mm.
The decorated body sherd found in Shovel Test 10 (Figure 1) was found
at a depth of 30-40 cm. It was fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the
open air, a process that results in the interior surface exhibiting a thin oxidized
band visible on the outside of the sherd core. It is a sandy paste sherd that was
tempered with bone. The interior surface treatment is described as smoothed,
and the thickness of this specimen was measured at 7.3 mm. The decorative
motif consists of two fingernail punctations, one of which is partially obscured by
more recent damage to the sherdâs exterior. The punctations are widely spaced,
but they may be part of a row of similar punctations on the body of the vessel or
near the juncture of the rim and body. The use of fingernail punctations as a
method of decoration for utility ware jars is a common feature of East Texas
Caddo ceramics that dates to the middle of the 9th century A.D, to the18th century
A.D. (Suhm and Jelks 1962).
The two sherds from Shovel Test 10 appear to be from the same vessel, a
moderately sized jar whose orifice diameter is estimated to be 15-20 cm based
on body wall thickness that ranges from 7.3 to 7.7 mm, although the sherds do
not conjoin. The vessel has a naturally sandy paste, and small amounts of
burned bone were added to the paste as temper by the potter to hold and bind
the paste together. The interior vessel surface was smoothed, as is commonly
the case for utility ware vessels. Interior smoothing was done to lower the
permeability and increase the heating effectiveness of the utility wares employed
for cooking (cf. Rice 1996:148).

Figure 1. Decorated Sherd from Shovel Test 10
Sherd from Shovel Test 11
The decorated body sherd found in Shovel Test 11 (Figure 2) was found
at a depth of 40-50 cm. It is a sandy paste sherd that was tempered with grog
(pieces of broken pottery) and hematite. The interior surface treatment is
smoothed, and the thickness of this specimen measures 6.9 mm. This sherd
represents a second vessel in this small assemblage. It is also from a
moderately-sized jar. The vessel was tempered with small amounts of grog
(crushed sherds or pieces of fired clay) and hematite, and the clay has a
naturally sandy paste. The use of grog and hematite as temper inclusions is
typical of East Texas Caddo pottery of all ages. The interior vessel surface was
smoothed. The sherd came from a vessel that was fired in a reducing
environment and cooled in the open air, a process that leaves the interior surface
with a thin oxidized band visible on the sherd core. The decorative motif consists
of shallow and very closely spaced incised lines or combing on the exterior
surface. The orientation of the lines is not certain, but it is likely these are
horizontal lines below the rim. There are no obvious drag or comb marks visible
in the bottom of the four lines, and this suggests that lines are probably from
incising. The lines are very shallow and not broad, and this separates this sherd
from most Caddo incised vessels that usually have narrow and V-shaped lines in
profile. Nevertheless, sherds from similar incised or combed vessels are
relatively commonplace at prehistoric Caddo sites in East Texas (Perttula 2010).

Figure 2. Decorated Sherd from Shovel Test 11
Conclusions
The three aboriginal sherds found at site 41HO268 are from two different
vessels, both likely jars decorated either with fingernail punctations or incised
lines. Such decorations are common on utility ware Caddo jars in East Texas
sites. Coiled pottery, the partially reduced firing method, and smoothing of the
interior surfaces of vessels are characteristics of prehistoric and early historic
Caddo ceramic practices and traditions. The preponderance of ceramic
technological and stylistic attributes in the 41HO268 ceramics indicate that they
are the product of a Caddo occupation at the site. A larger sample of decorated
sherds would be necessary to determine the age of the occupation, but it is
suspected that the site dates after circa A.D. 1300 to A.D. 1400. This is viewed
as the period of time when other such sites were most likely occupied in this part
of the Trinity River basin (Fields 2004; Gadus et al. 2002; Perttula 2009). Early
18th century Spanish chronicles have documented the presence of Caddo
peoples continuing to live in the Trinity River basin (and farther west) at that time
(Foster 2008:208-209).
