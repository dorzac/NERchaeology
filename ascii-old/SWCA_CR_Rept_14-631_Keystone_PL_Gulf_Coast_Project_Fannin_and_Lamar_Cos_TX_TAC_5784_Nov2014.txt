ABSTRACT
As part of the Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast Project (Project), SWCA conducted a cultural resources inventory
including intensive pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching on behalf of exp Energy Services Inc. (exp) and
TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, LP (Keystone) of 5.1 miles of 300-foot-wide easement that cross lands owned
by the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) along the southern terraces of the Red River in Fannin
and Lamar Counties, Texas. The 5.1 miles fall within the larger multi-state pipeline extending from Cushing,
Oklahoma to Nederland, Texas.
Regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit, the Project is subject to review
under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (16 United States
Code 470). SWCA’s cultural resources investigations, therefore, were designed to identify, inventory, and evaluate cultural resources in the 300-foot-wide environmental study area (ESA) to comply with the NHPA and its
implementing regulations (36 Code Federal Regulations Part 800). Additionally, as NTMWD is a political subdivision of the state and subject to compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), Permit No. 5784 was
obtained in September 2010 for cultural resources investigations within the Project ESA on lands acquired by
the NTMWD. Therefore, cultural resources were evaluated for their potential to be designated as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) in addition to eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
This report details the findings of investigations within the ACT permitted portion of the Project. Work conducted from October 26–29, 2010, assessed the 5.1 miles of mainline centerline and an additional 0.625 mile of
access roads. SWCA excavated a total of 207 shovel tests across the Project area. In addition to shovel testing,
11 backhoe trenches were excavated within an approximately 1.9-mile section of the Project APE. The methods
complied with the federal and state survey standards. Furthermore, 12 shovel tests were excavated on April 26–27,
2013, by SWCA to assess an unanticipated discovery encountered during the construction phase of the Project.
Seven cultural resources were identified during the investigations including two newly recorded archaeological
sites (41FN94 and 41FN144), two previously recorded archaeological sites (41FN51 and 41FN83), one newly
recorded historic-age architectural resource (CHSS7BFN101.001), and two newly recorded prehistoric isolated
finds (CIF6BFN11.001 and CIF6BFN11.002). Sites 41FN83 and 41FN94 are historic artifact scatters, neither of
which is eligible for NRHP listing or for designation as a SAL within the Project APE. Site 41FN51 is a multicomponent site with prehistoric and historic components. The historic component is not NRHP or SAL eligible,
whereas the prehistoric component is of undetermined eligibility. The architectural resource, CHSS7BFN101.001,
consists of a historic-age corral complex associated with a cattle sale yard and may be a contributing element to
the larger Riverby Ranch. The historic resource complex is of undetermined NRHP and SAL eligibility requiring
an assessment of the larger historic ranch with which it is associated to make a clear eligibility determination.
Site 41FN144, an unanticipated discovery inadvertently disturbed during the construction phase of the Project,
consists of a prehistoric Caddo artifact scatter with an undetermined eligibility for listing in the NRHP and designation as an SAL. The prehistoric isolated finds consist of one quartzite biface fragment (CIF6BFN11.001)
and one petrified wood secondary flake (CIF6BFN11.002). Isolated finds are not NRHP or SAL eligible.
Additionally, two previously recorded sites (41FN40 and 41FN82) are mapped within the ACT permitted Project ESA. The two sites were not relocated within the mainline Project ESA during the current investigations,
although artifacts likely associated with such were observed adjacent to the survey area. Another two previously
recorded sites (41FN41 and 41FN88) are mapped immediately adjacent to the ACT permitted Project ESA along
Project access road CAR-475. Similarly, the previous 2008 investigations prior to acquirement of the lands by
NTMWD revealed no components associated with these two sites, likely the same resource recorded twice by
different projects, within the Project access road survey area. Therefore, it was determined that none of these
four sites extends into the Project ESA.

i

Avoidance of the prehistoric portions of site 41FN51, the historic-age corral complex (CHSS7BFN101.001),
and site 41FN144 that are of undetermined NRHP and SAL eligibility was recommended. Avoidance measures
were implemented during the construction phase of the Project. Therefore, the Project will not affect significant
cultural resources and no further work is recommended. No artifacts were collected during this survey and consequently, no artifacts were curated.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Cultural Resources Inventory of Areas Permitted under the Antiquities Code of Texas on the
Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast Project, Fannin and Lamar Counties, Texas
SWCA PROJECT NUMBER: 15724.01
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: As part of the Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast Project (Project), a multi-state pipeline being assessed for cultural resources in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and other
applicable federal regulations, SWCA conducted a cultural resources inventory including intensive pedestrian
survey and backhoe trenching on behalf of exp Energy Services Inc. (exp) and TransCanada Keystone Pipeline,
LP (Keystone) of 5.1 miles of 300-foot-wide easement that cross lands owned by the North Texas Municipal
Water District (NTMWD) along the southern terraces of the Red River in Fannin and Lamar Counties, Texas.
LOCATION: The project area is located within Fannin and Lamar Counties in the NTMWD. The area is depicted
on the Lake West (3395-333), Monkstown (3395-332), and Direct (3395-331) U. S. Geological Survey (USGS)
7.5-minute quadrangle maps.
AREA SURVEYED: SWCA conducted an intensive pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching of 5.1 miles of
300-foot-wide mainline centerline and an additional 0.625 mile of access roads within the NTMWD property.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Kevin A. Miller and Stephen M. Carpenter
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT: 5784
DATES OF WORK: October 26–29, 2010, and April 26–27, 2013
PURPOSE OF WORK: Regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit, the Project
is subject to review under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended
(16 United States Code 470). SWCA’s cultural resources investigations under exp’s and Keystone’s supervision,
therefore, were designed to identify, inventory, and evaluate cultural resources in the 300-foot-wide environmental
study area (ESA) to comply with the NHPA and its implementing regulations (36 Code Federal Regulations
Part 800). In addition, a portion of the Project in Fannin and Lamar Counties within lands owned by NTWMD
was subject to compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and the work was conducted under Permit
No. 5784 obtained in September 2010 after the NTWMD acquired the lands. Therefore, cultural resources were
evaluated for their potential to be designated as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) in addition to eligibility
for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
NUMBER OF RESOURCES: Seven cultural resources were identified during the investigations including two newly
recorded archaeological sites (41FN94 and 41FN144), two previously recorded archaeological sites (41FN51
and 41FN83), one newly recorded historic-age architectural resource (CHSS7BFN101.001), and two newly
recorded prehistoric isolated finds (CIF6BFN11.001 and CIF6BFN11.002).
SITES LISTED OR ELIGIBLE FOR THE NRHP/SAL: 0
SITES WITH UNDETERMINED NRHP/SAL STATUS: Three cultural resources including two archaeological sites
(41FN51 and 41FN144) and one historic-age architectural resource consisting of a standing structure complex
(CHSS7BFN101.001) are of undetermined eligibility.
SITES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR NRHP/SAL LISTING: Two archaeological sites (41FN83 and 41FN94) are recommended as not eligible for listing in the NRHP or designation as SALs. The isolated finds (CIF6BFN11.001 and
CIF6BFN11.002) are not NRHP or SAL eligible.

vii

Summary and Recommendations: Of the seven cultural resources identified in the APE, two archaeological
sites and one historic-age architectural resource are of undetermined NRHP and SAL eligibility, while two
archaeological sites and two prehistoric isolated finds are not eligible for listing in the NRHP or designation as
SALs.
The two archaeological sites and one architectural resource of undetermined eligibility were avoided during the
construction phase of the Project. By avoiding the two sites and the historic standing structure (HSS) complex
with undetermined NRHP and SAL eligibility, the proposed Project will not affect significant cultural resources.
No artifacts were collected during this survey; therefore, no artifacts were curated.

IntroductIon

AreA of PotentiAl effects

On behalf of the TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, LP
(Keystone), exp Energy Services Inc. (exp) retained
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) to conduct
a cultural resources inventory including intensive
pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching of 5.1 miles
of 300-foot-wide easement that cross lands owned by
the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD)
along the southern terraces of the Red River in Fannin
and Lamar Counties, Texas (Figure 1). The 5.1 miles
fall within the larger Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast
Project (Project) multi-state pipeline extending from
Cushing, Oklahoma, to Nederland, Texas.

Construction of the 36-inch-diameter crude-oil pipeline
entails an area that comprises 5.1 miles of mainline
centerline and 0.625 mile of access roads in the ACTpermitted area of the Project (Figure 2). The ESA for
the mainline consists of the 300-foot-wide corridor,
which is a broader area of coverage to accommodate
minor adjustments or reroutes as they become known.
Within this ESA, the Project’s Area of Potential Effects
(APE) includes a 110-foot-wide construction right-of­
way. Fifty feet of this APE will become a permanently
maintained easement, incorporating other Projectrelated construction areas, such as pipeline operations
and maintenance. Typically, maximum depth of
impacts are 10 feet or less, though boring and drilling
beneath features such as drainages or roadways entail
significantly deeper subsurface impacts.

Regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) Section 404 permit, the Project is subject
to review under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (16
United States Code 470). SWCA’s cultural resources
investigations, therefore, were designed to identify,
inventory, and evaluate cultural resources in the
300-foot-wide environmental study area (ESA)
to comply with the NHPA and its implementing
regulations (36 Code Federal Regulations [CFR]
Part 800). Additionally, as NTMWD is a political
subdivision of the state and subject to compliance with
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), Permit No. 5784
was obtained in September 2010 for cultural resources
investigations within the Project ESA on lands acquired
by the NTMWD. Therefore, cultural resources were
evaluated for their potential to be designated as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) in addition to eligibility
for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP).
Over the course of investigations, modifications to the
alignment were made in response to concerns identified
during the study and design process. Accordingly, a
series of “footprints” were issued. This report details
the findings of investigations within the ACT-permitted
portion of the Project. Work conducted from October
26–29, 2010, assessed a total of 5.1 miles of mainline
and 0.625 mile of access roads. The investigations
reflect the Project construction footprint as of October
21, 2011. The final Project construction footprint
of February 25, 2013, falls within the October 21,
2011, configuration in the Texas portion of the
Project. Additionally, this report discusses cultural
resources investigations performed on April 26–27,
2013, by SWCA to assess an unanticipated discovery
inadvertently encountered during the construction
phase of the Project.

Other areas that may lie outside the pipeline construction
right-of-way, but that are considered part of the ESA,
include temporary work spaces, access roads, storage/
warehouse yards, pump stations and valves. The ESA
for access roads ranged from 75- to 150-feet-wide,
extending 37.5 feet to 75 feet from either side of
the proposed road centerline. Depths of impact on
access roads are typically surficial, though in some
circumstances grading up to 2 to 4 feet may be required.

EnvIronmEntal SEttIng
South of the Red River, the survey area extends across
approximately 0.3 mile of the hardwood-forested
Red River Bottomlands and roughly 2.5 miles of the
Fluvial Pleistocene Terraces. These riparian zone set­
tings are typically dominated by pine and deciduous
hardwoods, but south of the Red River, much of the
timber has long ago been cleared for use as agricultural
fields and pasture. In the uplands, the Project crosses
nearly 1.8 miles of the rolling Northern Plains Outli­
ers grasslands. The survey area intersects a few minor
drainages, including unnamed branches of the Red
River and Bois d’Arc Creek.

GeoloGy
The project area passes through differing geological
settings. The northern portion of the project area
includes Quaternary deposits of gravel, sand, silt, and
clay that are Pleistocene-age fluviatile terrace deposits
and Recent (Holocene) alluvium at the margins of the
Red River (McGowen et al. 1991). The geology for

the southern portion of the project area is Cretaceous
sedimentary formations. The formations are associated
with Upper Cretaceous deposition and include Eagle
Ford Formation sandstone and limestone (Barnes
1979). The rocks of this formation are limestones and
marls, typically ocean floor deposits laid down by
Cretaceous seas (Roberts 1996).
The Alluvium and Fluviatile terrace deposits typically
are relatively young deposits along current drainages
and are particularly evident along the Red River.
Alluvium primarily includes Holocene floodplain
deposits consisting of clay, silt, sand, and gravel.
Igneous and metamorphic rocks found in these deposits
derive from reworked fluviatile terrace deposits
(McGowen et al. 1991). The Fluviatile terrace deposits
are Pleistocene terraces consisting of gravel, sand, silt,
and clay, ancient remnants of the Red River terraces
that are particularly prominent along the southern side
of the river (Barnes 1979).
The siliceous materials found in Alluvium and
Fluviatile deposits provide substantial, high-quality
lithic resources. Many of the creek beds along the
survey areas are replete with cobbles of cherts and other
siliceous, much of which is suitable for all stages of
lithic reduction. Based on the materials recovered from
recorded sites, the inhabitants utilized these resources.
Elsewhere, the formations in the adjacent uplands,
likely the primary source for the bed load gravels,
comprise a variety of cherts, sandstone and ironstone
that was used in prehistoric times for lithic reduction,
manos, metates, and a variety of other items.

ecoloGicAl reGions
The Project area encompasses two topographically,
geologically, and climatically diverse ecological
regions (Omernik Level III Ecoregions [Griffith et al.
2004]), including the East Central Texas Plains and
the South Central Plains. These further represent two
Level IV ecoregions, including the Northern Blackland
Prairie and Northern Post Oak Savanna. Humid mixed
woodlands and grasslands typify these regions, and all
currently support agricultural production in the form of
cropland, pastureland, or woodland for lumber. Oil and
gas production is common on the South Central Plains.

HydroloGy
The Project area falls within the Red River basin.
The Red River and its two prominent tributaries, the
Sulphur River and Big Cypress Creek, are part of the

vast Mississippi River watershed. Channeled by a
series of east-west oriented geological formations, the
Red River and its tributaries flow generally eastward
across the northern portion of the Project area. The
Red River, consistent with most rivers farther to the
north in Oklahoma, is a broad, sand-choked channel
bordered by tall forests of elm, cottonwood, sycamore,
and willow.

soils
Within the APE, the dominant soil order is mapped as
Alfisols. Alfisols, defined by subsurface accumulations
of clay, are mapped south of the Red River and
intermittently throughout the Coastal Plain. In the
Western Coastal Plain and Flatwoods, series such
as Otanya, Kirbyville, and Evadale form on Tertiary
marine and alluvial deposits in level to steep settings.
Specific soils located within the survey area are listed
in Table 1 (NRCS 2013).

florA
Broadly defined, the project area lies within a complex
of intermingled floral communities, mainly the Cross
Timbers and Prairies region composed of grasses and
open savannah and brush and the Post Oak Savannah
region, composed of oak-hickory deciduous forest with
understories of grasses (Correll and Johnston 1979).
The typical vegetation communities observed along
both project alignments consist of post-oak (Quercus
stellata var.) and eastern red cedar (Juniperus
virginiana) woodland. Other trees include hackberry
(Celtis laevigata), American elm (Ulmus Americana),
cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), Texas oak (Quercus
texana), Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), bitternut
hickory (Carya cordiformis), bur oak (Quercus
macrocarpa), and sand post oak (Quercus margaretta)
with an understory of shrub and herbaceous layers that
occur in low densities and include sapling American
beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), saw greenbriar
(Smilax bona-nox), cedar sedge (Carex planostachys),
laurel greenbriar (Smilax laurifolia), yaupon holly (Ilex
vomitoria), and Texas bluebonnet (Lupinus texensis)
(Brown 1985; Kricher and Morrison 1998; Stein et al.
2003; Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Vegetation commonly observed in the riparian areas
of the alignments includes sugar hackberry (Celtis
laevigata), pecan (Carya illinoensis), and post oak
(Quercus stellata) with a dense understory of grasses,
vines and shrubs.

fAunA
The project area is located in the northern Texan biotic
province, which extends from the central Texas to
east-central Oklahoma (Blair 1950). The Texan biotic
province is a transitional zone from the mesic forests
of eastern North America to the xeric grasslands of the
central United States. The province has a high faunal
diversity. Blair (1950) identified at least 49 species
of mammals, 57 species of reptiles, and 23 species of
amphibians native to the region.
A variety of wildlife exists along the project area, as it
lies along the boundary of two floral regions, the cross
timbers and prairies and the post-oak savannah. Blair
(1950) defines the following mammals as common
within the Austroriparian province: whitetailed
deer (Odocileus virginianus), muskrat (Ondatra
zibethicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis
latrans), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), eastern
mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern pipistrellus
bat (Pipestrellus subflavus), red bat (Lasiurus
carolinensis), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), gray
squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), southern flying squirrel

rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), cotton rat (Sigmodon
hispidus), packrat (Neotoma floridana), eastern
cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Historically, red wolf, bison and
black bear ranged into or near the project area (Burt
and Grossenheider 1976; Kricher and Morrison 1998;
Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Bison constituted one of the major game resources
throughout prehistory. However, this resource was
intermittently absent from the region (Dillehay 1974).
Possibly more than any other resource except cultigens
in later prehistory, bison played a profound role in
nearly all aspects of some prehistoric society, including
technological organization, mobility, population size,
political organization, and, to an extent, all others.
Common land turtles include the eastern box
turtle (Terrapene Carolina) and western box turtle
(Terrapene ornate), while the snapping turtle (Chelydra
serpentinia), river cooter (Chrysemys concinna), and

and Sutton 1985).

climAte
The study area falls into the Subtropical Humid climate
zone which is characterized by warm summers (Larkin
and Bomar 1983) and receives 40 to 50 inches of
precipitation annually with a mean annual temperature
ranging from 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (ºF) (Owenby
et al. 1992). The area experiences between 210 and 270
frost-free days. January minimum temperatures range
from 28°F to 43ºF while July maximum temperatures

range from 92°F to 96ºF, on average (Parameter­
elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model
[PRISM] 2004). July precipitation ranges from 2.4 to
5.0 inches, while January precipitation ranges from 1.6
to 5.0 inches, on average (PRISM 2004).

PAleoenvironment
Paleoclimatic data from the central and east Texas
regions indicate broad climatic shifts over time.
Through the examination of proxy data (e.g., bog pollen,
speleothems, and various isotopic analyses) from
several regional studies, the regional paleoenvironment
for the late Pleistocene and Holocene in Texas can be
characterized (Bousman 1992, 1994, 1998; Bryant
and Shafer 1977; Cooke et al. 2003; Graham and
Heimsch 1960; Nordt et al. 2002; Potzger and Tharp
1954; Toomey et al. 1993; Valastro and Davis 1970).
Admittedly, not all data are unanimously accepted
and there are gaps in the record, but most researchers
generally accept the review provided here.
Subsequent to the last glacial maximum approximately
18,000 b.p. the climate was interpreted to have cooler
temperatures and more mesic conditions for the Central
Texas and Texas Coastal Plain (Bousman 1998; Bryant
and Holloway 1985; Bryant and Shafer 1977; Hudler
2000; Musgrove et al. 2001; Nordt et al. 2002, 2007;
Sylvia and Galloway 2006; Toomey et al. 1993). These
cool and mesic conditions prevailed until 15,000 and
again around 12,000 b.p. when it is interpreted from
pollen data and isotopic analyses that glacial melt
waters entered the Gulf of Mexico and triggered arid
and presumably warmer conditions in Texas (Bousman
1998:214; Nordt et al. 2002:182). This assessment is
further supported by low growth rates on speleothems
from dated stalagmites in several central Texas caves
implying more xeric conditions (Musgrove et al. 2001).
The more recent xeric period was followed by a shift
back to cooler temperatures and moist conditions
in Texas, which continued into the Early Holocene
(Bousman 1998:214).
From the Early to Middle Holocene (~10,500–5,000
b.p.) the proxy data suggest that the climate became
gradually warmer and more xeric (Bryant and Shafer
1977; Toomey et al. 1993). These data include pollen
evidence suggesting a decrease in arboreal canopy
and more open grassland for central and south- central
Texas (Bousman 1998), various fauna indicator
species from cave deposits (Hudler 2000; Toomey
et al. 1993), the presence or extinction of various

Texas Antiquities Permit Report
Molluscan fauna (Neck 1983, 1987), and shifts in
C3–C4 plant production (Nordt et al. 1994, 2002). This
prominent period of warmer temperatures, decreasing
moisture, and a recession of woodlands is sometimes
called the Altithermal or Hypsithermal among others
(Collins 2004; Neck 1987; Story 1990; Toomey et al.
1993). These warming and xeric conditions existed
throughout this time with some minor deviations and
probably localized variations (Hudler 2000:88–89).
One anomaly of note is a brief episode of moister
conditions in Texas occurring ~6,000 b.p. as evidenced
by an increase in arboreal pollen and data from isotopic
composition of organic and inorganic carbon (Bousman
1998; Nordt et al. 2002:186). This brief cool and moist
episode was immediately followed by an extremely
arid and warm climate (Bousman 1998; Nordt et al.
2002). This xeric period lasting roughly 1,000 years
was exhibited by a drastic reduction in arboreal pollen
and an increase in grassland pollen with the former
reaching its lowest point and the latter reaching its
zenith at approximately 5,000 b.p. (Bousman 1998).
From this arid and warm period extreme, the Late
Holocene climate is described as gradually increasing
in moisture and cooling in temperature (Bousman
1998; Nordt et al. 2002, 2007). The mesic indicators
of this time were exhibited through a gradual increase
in woodland canopy and data from stable isotope
analyses in buried soils (Bousman 1998; Nordt et al.
2002, 2007). Nordt and others (2007:159) characterize
this period as a ‘cool interlude’ before conditions again
transition into a more xeric and warm climate. This
arid interval extends from roughly from 2,600 to 1,000
b.p. before again becoming slightly more mesic and
continuing as such up to the present (Nordt et al. 2007).
The last 1,000 years are indicated to have some brief
fluctuations of arid conditions occurring around 300
to 500 b.p. before trending toward modern climates
of the present (Bousman 1998:216). Furthermore,
East Texas has experienced a series of drought events
interspersed with episodes of higher than average
effective moisture (precipitation minus evaporation),
as indicated by the Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI) for East Texas (Cook et al. 2004). During the
period of a.d. 1150 to 1200, peak effective moisture
characterized East Texas. Effective moisture rates
far below average characterized the record from a.d.
1100 to 1150, a.d. 1220 to 1250, and around a.d. 1450.
Climate conditions became more equable after around
a.d. 1600, approximating modern conditions.

cultural HIStory
The Project APE falls within the Red River archaeological
region as defined by Perttula (2004). Prehistoric Native
American settlement in Texas is generally divided into
four broad chronological categories: the Paleoindian
period (approximately 12,000 b.c. to 6,000 b.c.), the
Archaic period (approximately 6,000 b.c. to a.d. 700),
the Formative period (200 b.c. to a.d. 800), and the
Late Prehistoric period (beginning approximately
a.d. 800 and continuing to European contact circa
a.d. 1600). The Archaic period is further divided
into four subcategories: Early, Middle, Late, and
Formative/Woodland. Likewise, the Late Prehistoric
period, dominated in the region by Caddo culture, is
subdivided into the Formative, Early, Middle, and Late
Caddo periods.
The Historic period, beginning circa a.d. 1600, is
marked by the explorations and settlement of Europeans
in what is now Texas following the early entradas of
Spanish conquistadores and French settlement attempts
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Historic
Texas is discussed regionally, in terms of Northeast,
Central East, and Southeast Texas.

PAleoindiAn Period
The Paleoindian period in Texas begins at the end of
the Pleistocene. The best evidence for Paleoindian
occupation in North and Northeast Texas dates from
approximately 9,500 b.c. to 7,500 b.c. (Jurney et al.
1989:14). During the Paleoindian period, the general
model of human settlement is that of small, highly
mobile groups that exploited broad areas for hunting
and gathering. While sensational finds have often
led to a view of subsistence based on large game,
many sites reveal an intensive exploitation among
Paleoindian groups of locally available small game.
As Meltzer and Bever (1995:59) state: “there is ample
reason to doubt Clovis groups were big-game hunters
(of mastodon or mammoth). More likely, they were
generalized hunter-gatherers who occasionally pursued
big-game, but more often exploited smaller, less risky
prey. Like turtles.”
Population levels are inferred to have increased
throughout the Paleoindian era, though a specific
means of assessing prehistoric population trends
has yet to be formulated and extensively applied.
Nevertheless, the initial period of human settlement
was clearly a populating phase in which opportunistic

8

groups established the first cultural landscapes and
social networks.
Diagnostic artifacts from this period generally have
been recovered from the surface and include basallyground, lanceolate-shaped points that are sometimes
fluted, such as Clovis and Folsom. However, only
moderate numbers of early Paleoindian points have
been reported within the region (Meltzer and Bever
1995). Well-studied sites in and around this region
include the Domebo Site in Caddo County, Oklahoma;
Aubrey Site and Lewisville Lake in North Central
Texas; Big Pine Lake Site; and several sites in the
Red River drainage, including Murphey and Quince
(Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1990:72; Jurney
et al. 1989:15; Peter et al. 1991:6). Late Paleoindian
point types identified in the region include Angostura,
Plainview, and Golondrina and date from roughly 8,000
b.c. to 6,800 b.c. (Turner and Hester 1999).

ArcHAic Period
The Archaic period spans a lengthy period, beginning
around 6,000 b.c. and ending around 200 b.c. In
general, the Archaic period is one of very strong
cultural stability (Peter et al. 1991:6). During this
period, a variety of tools and projectile points were
developed (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1990:74).
Good examples of Archaic sites in Northeast Texas
include the Jake Martin Site in Upshur County, the
Yarbrough Site in Van Zandt County, the Manton Miller
Site on the Upper Sulphur River in Delta County, and
the Finley Fan Site in Hopkins County (Heartfield,
Price and Greene, Inc. 1990:75; Perttula 1995:335).
The Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle,
and Late periods, each of which is discussed below.
The Early Archaic period spans approximately 6,000
b.c. to 4,000 b.c. There is a lack of well-documented
Early Archaic sites in North Central and East Texas,
as Archaic sites in the region often are not single
component sites or are not stratified (Jurney et al.
1989:16; Peter et al. 1991:6). The best excavated
transitional Paleoindian to Archaic and Early Archaic
sites in the region are the Boat Dock Site, the Summers
Site, and the Gore Pit Site (Jurney et al. 1989:17).
During the Early Archaic period, populations lived
in small groups, making seasonal nomadic rounds.
The use of ground stone tools begins in this period
and may indicate a more intensive use of plant
resources. In general, points transitioned from fluted,
long lanceolate to non-fluted during the Paleoindian

period and then changed to the shorter, corner-notched
triangulate shapes seen in the Early Archaic (Jurney
et al. 1989:16). Dalton, San Patrice, and Merserve are
considered transitional point types and are sometimes
included in Paleoindian period (Heartfield, Price and
Greene, Inc. 1990:72; Jurney et al. 1989:16; Peter et
al. 1991:6). Early Archaic point types in North Central
Texas include Big Sandy, Hoxie, Hardin, and others
(Jurney et al. 1989:17; Turner and Hester 1999).
The Middle Archaic period spans approximately 4,000
b.c. to 2,000 b.c. Points increase in size from the Early
to Middle Archaic periods and change from cornernotched to side-notched. Point bases transition from
expanding stem types to parallel stemmed and finally
to the contracting stemmed forms of the Middle and
Late Archaic. Central and North Texas point types
associated with the Middle Archaic include Pedernales,
Bulverde, Travis, Nolan, Wells, Carrollton, and Morrill.
Use of the basal notched group of points found in
Central and North Texas may have started late in Early
Archaic. Burned rock middens, common in central
Texas during this time, have not been associated with
Middle Archaic sites in North Central Texas. Signs
of regionalization are first found at the end of Middle
Archaic and continue during the Late Archaic (Jurney
et al. 1989:18). The exchange of non-local materials,
and finished tools in particular, may have been common
in some parts of the region during the Middle Archaic
period (Perttula 1995:335).
The Late Archaic spans approximately 2,000 b.c. to
200 b.c. Compared to the Early and Middle Archaic,
the Late Archaic has more sites overall and more
archaeological investigations have been conducted at
these sites (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1990:74;
Jurney et al. 1989:19). The increase in the number
of sites in Northeast Texas is hypothesized to be the
result of increased population densities (Jurney et al.
1989:19–20; Nickels et al. 1999:21; Perttula 1995:335).
However, western portions of northeast Texas might
have been less populated than other parts of northeast
Texas (Nickels et al. 1999:21). It is hypothesized that
populations were neither sedentary nor occupied sites
year-round but moved within limited geographic areas
(Perttula 1995:335). Further evidence of increased
regionalization in this period comes from areas, such
as the upper Trinity River drainages, that exhibit
increased use of local quartzite to replace non-local
chert (Perttula 1995:335). Archaic tool types in North
Texas are more varied than in South Texas, and North

Texas Antiquities Permit Report
Texas might have experienced wetter, more hospitable
conditions (Jurney et al. 1989:19). Late Archaic
material culture in northeastern Texas is associated
with the broadly defined LaHarpe Aspect (Espey,
Huston and Associates, Inc. 1990:4-2; Johnson 1962;
Jurney et al. 1989:19). This includes contracting based
dart points of which the Gary type is the most common.
Other types include Ellis, Elam, Ensor, Godley, Dallas,
Lange, Marshall, and the slightly earlier Yarbrough and
Trinity types (Jurney et al. 1989:19; Kahl et al. 1999:9).

formAtive Period
The Formative period, also known as the Early
Ceramic or Woodland period, is defined as 200 b.c.
to a.d. 800. This period is characterized by increasing
sedentism and social complexity as well as by
possible increases in population (Story et al. 1990).
Technological innovations during this period include
the use of ceramics, bow and arrow technology,
and experimentation with plant domestication and
horticulture.
In Northeast Texas, sedentary or semi-sedentary
populations occupied villages and hamlets located on
floodplains and terraces of larger streams as well as
smaller upland components. The construction of burial
mounds containing non-local materials, such as cherts,
copper ornaments, ceramics, and marine shells, begins
during this period on the Middle Sabine, Angelina,
Neches, and Red rivers (Jurney et al. 1989:23; Peter et
al. 1991:7). Among the westernmost of these mounds
are the Harlig Morgan and Sanders sites. The Sanders
Site is in the extreme northwest corner of Lamar County
at the mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek, near the Red River
(Jurney et al. 1989:24). Harlig Morgan (41FN1), in
Fannin County, is the farthest west of the mound sites,
but it has been destroyed since its documentation (Peter
et al. 1991:8). There is evidence for at least limited
trading ties with other Middle Woodland groups, and
there are similarities between East Texas mounds from
this period and the Hopewell and Marksville mounds
of the Mississippi Valley (Jurney et al. 1989:22–24).
Little evidence of domesticated plant use in the Red
River drainage during the Formative period exists;
however, a squash rind from Site 41HP137 at Cooper
Lake in Hopkins County radiocarbon dates to 140
+/- 30 b.c. (Jurney et al. 1989:20; Peter et al. 1991:7).
Despite a lack of direct evidence, the introduction
of ceramics in this period may be linked to changes
in subsistence and food processing (Jurney et al.

9

1989:22–23). Inhabitants of the Northeast Texas
region probably began to rely on horticulture during
the Formative period, and intensive maize agriculture
may have been introduced by the period’s end (Kahl
et al. 1999:9–10).
The major technological innovations of the bow and
arrow and ceramic containers are assigned to this period
(Kahl et al. 1999:9; Nickels et al. 1999:22). The use of
ceramics within the region is variable, with some sites
(particularly along the Red River) yielding copious
numbers of ceramic artifacts while others (notably
between the Sulphur and Sabine rivers) produce far
less. Because ceramics are associated with boiled foods
(particularly those rich in carbohydrates) and increased
sedentism, archaeologists have suggested that sites
with high numbers of ceramic artifacts reflect different
dietary habits and settlement practices than sites with
few ceramics (Perttula 2004; Skibo and Blinman 1999).
Ceramic types tend to be of the Lower Mississippi
Valley type and include Tchefuncte Stamped, Churupa
Punctated, Marksville Incised, Marksville Stamped,
and Troyville Stamped. The ceramics may have been
traded, or local potters may have adopted these styles
from neighboring groups (Perttula and Bruseth 1995;
Schambach 1982).
Early ceramics in the northeast Texas region are
affiliated with the Fourche Maline Phase (Jurney et
al. 1989:24). The Fourche Maline cultural tradition
is found throughout eastern Oklahoma, southwestern
Arkansas, and may extend into parts of North Central
and Northeast Texas. Grog-tempered ceramics in the
region are likely associated with Fourche Maline
tradition whose ceramics are grog-tempered, often
undecorated, flat-based vessels with flaring sides.
Williams Plain, a common Fourche Maline ceramic
type, dates prior to a.d. 800 and is almost always
associated with pre-Caddoan occupations. The Sanders
Site may have a pre-Caddoan component, as it yielded
a significant amount of Williams Plain. However,
these ceramics were mixed with later material. Sand
and grit tempered ceramics, likely associated with the
Tchefuncte-related cultures, are generally found in
South Texas and southern parts of East Texas (Jurney
et al. 1989:22). Some sandy paste ceramic types were
identified at the Cooper Lake Project, south of Fannin
County (Jurney et al. 1989:24).
Mortuary practices from the Formative period provide
more evidence for sedentism. The Hurricane Hill
Site along the Sulphur River in western Louisiana

10

Cultural Resources Inventory of the Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast Project in Texas

has yielded flexed, bundle, and cremation burials in
a small burial ground (Perttula 1999). At the Snipes
Site (41CP8), shallow extended burials included whole
vessels, boatstones, celts, and bifaces used as funerary
objects (Schambach 1982). Burial practices at the
Hurricane Hill Site, and the Johnny Ford Site across the
Red River in Arkansas, are comparable to one another,
suggesting shared belief systems among Woodland
Period groups (Perttula 2004). Furthermore, Perttula
(2004) maintains that formally bounded cemeteries
at Woodland sites suggest the presence of distinctive
social groups based on kinship or residence.

cAddo Period
In the northeastern and east central portions of
Texas, the Caddo culture emerged around a.d. 800.
Throughout the long study of the Caddo, a number
of chronological schemes have been developed. The
current study follows the divisions and nomenclature
proposed by Story (1990:333–334), which includes a
five-part division: Formative Caddoan (800–1000 a.d.),
Early Caddoan (1000-1200 a.d.), Middle Caddoan
(1200-1400 a.d.), Late Caddoan (1400-1680 a.d.), and
Historic Caddoan (1680-1860 a.d.). The Caddo culture,
which represents the southwestern most expression of
the Mississippian Tradition, was part of a larger culture
area that spanned east Texas and parts of Arkansas,
Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma. Compared to
other cultures and archaeological complexes, the Caddo
culture is among the best understood, in part because
of cultural continuity from prehistoric to modern times
that yield a cumulative archaeological, ethnographic/
ethnohistorical, and historical record. Archaeologists
have quite often used contact period accounts by
Europeans to understand the archaeological record.
After contact, the Caddo remained in northeast Texas,
much reduced in numbers, until they either migrated
or were removed (1854) to Oklahoma, where they
reformed as a now federally recognized tribe. Like the
Woodland period, the Caddoan period is hypothesized
to have increasing levels of population, sedentism, and
social complexity, including social ranking. The Late
Caddo period is further subdivided into five areally
distinct community phases within Texas including
Angelina, Frankston, McCurtain, Texarkana/Belcher,
and Titus.
Sites of the Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo
periods are found primarily on elevated landforms
(alluvial terraces and rises, natural levees, and upland

edges) adjacent to streams, minor tributaries, and
spring-fed branches. There was a preference for sandy
loam soils, perhaps for the good quality of drainage
and fertility. All habitats within the region were
used, either intensively via sedentary communities
or farmsteads, or periodically through short-term
camps for specialized resource exploitation. The
economy, which was a mixture of hunting, foraging,
and agriculture, supported a complex, hierarchical
socioeconomic system symbolically centered on
mound structures (Perttula 2004).
The settlement pattern involved a variety of site types
ranging in size, intensity, and occupational duration.
The smallest sites were periodically used for limited
resource exploitation. Medium-size sites included
agricultural hamlets and farmsteads occupied by one
or more families on a seasonal or permanent basis.
The largest sites were permanently occupied villages
associated with mounds or mound complexes (Brus­
eth 1998; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Cliff 1997; Cliff
et al. 1996; Cruse 1994, 1995; Largent et al. 1997;
Middlebrook 1994, 1997; Perttula et al. 1986; Thur­
mond 1990a). The George C. Davis Site in Cherokee
County is perhaps the most thoroughly understood site
of this type in Texas. The site was occupied from ca.
a.d. 800 through 1350 and consisted of a village with
three mounds. Mounds A and B were flat-topped plat­
form mounds while Mound C was a burial mound that
contained 25 to 30 elite ranking burials (Story 1997,
1998, 2000). The Oak Hill Village Site (41RK214) in
Rusk County is a non-mound site with 42 circular to
rectangular post structures arranged around a central
plaza (Perttula and Rogers 2007). There were also
extensive middens, a possible granary, and two large
circular structures that may have served as public struc­
tures (Cruse 1994, 1995; Rogers et al. 1994; Rogers
and Perttula 1999; Perttula and Rogers 2007).
The subsistence strategy was a mixture of hunting,
foraging, and agriculture. Hunting and gathering
activities focused on fish, deer, and other animal
species as well as the collection of nuts and tubers.
Cultivated foods included native seed, maize, and
squash (Perttula and Bruseth 1983). Maize had long
been an important food source, but evidence suggests
that between 1100 and 1300 a.d. it was a horticultural
mainstay for nearly all Caddo groups (Burnett 1990;
Perttula 1992a:14; Rose et al. 1998). The presence of
granaries at some sites indicates that surpluses were
common. Burnett (1990) suggests that in the rural

Texas Antiquities Permit Report

Caddo communities south of the Red River, maize was
not a dietary staple, as is evidenced by a low frequency
of dental caries and porotic hyperostosis, conditions
often associated with dependence on maize and other
starchy foods.

hierarchy were larger “towns” of linear but dispersed
compounds with specialized structures such as brush
covered shelters and storage platforms. At the top of the
hierarchy were civic-ceremonial centers with platform
and/or burial mounds (Schambach 1983).

Regular food surpluses catalyzed the development
of a rich material culture, helped divert labor efforts
to the construction of mounds, and supported a rank
of social elites. The material culture of Formative,
Early, and Middle Caddo groups included well-made
corner-notched and rectangular stemmed arrow points,
siltstone and greenstone celts, perforators and borers,
Gahagan bifaces, ceramic earspools, ceramic figurines,
and long-stemmed Red River and cigar-shaped ceramic
pipes (Hofman 1967; Newell and Krieger 1949).

Titus phase sites, located north of the present study
area, provide good examples of the sites within the
hierarchy. Small settlements covering 0.5 to 4.5 acres
(0.2–1.8 hectares) account for 73 percent of the known
Titus phase settlements within the Cypress Creek
Basin. These small settlements were occupied yearround, but probably for no more than one generation.
Structures were usually circular and constructed of
poles covered with grass or wattle and daub. The
interior of the structures was made of racks and
benches for sleeping, and some refuse debris on the
unprepared floor. Children tended to be buried beneath
house floors. Household refuse was mostly disposed
of in designated areas outside of the house. These
refuse dumps were either communal or associated
with a particular structure. Pits, drying racks, hearths,
and armadas/arbors were common exterior features
(Thurmond 1990a).

Mortuary practices reflect both the wealth of material
culture and hint at a hierarchy of social statuses.
Burials often include grave offerings such as ceramic
vessels, carved shell, bone earspools, shell beads
and more (Middlebrook 1994). The mounds and
mound complexes are manifestations of an extensive,
integrated socioeconomic system. Both temple (flattopped platform) mounds and burial mounds were built.
The larger sites with multiple mounds and attendant
villages served as important civic and/or ceremonial
loci. These sites emerged after ca. a.d. 900 and are
more or less evenly spaced along the Red River, Sabine
River, and Big Cypress Bayou. Thurmond (1990b)
suggests that this distribution indicates a regional
system of interaction and redistribution.
The Late Caddo period is characterized by a sedentary,
agriculturally based complex society led by social
elites who lived at mound centers. In the Late Caddo
period, the larger Caddo Culture area (covering parts of
Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas)
is subdivided into ten phases. Five of these phases are
present within Texas: Angelina, Frankston, McCurtain,
Texarkana, and Titus. The Belcher Phase is located
along the Texas/Louisiana border.
Within the Piney Woods of Texas, the manifestation of
the Late Caddo period has been characterized as part
of a rural Caddo community system (Perttula 1992a).
Settlements tend to be along secondary drainages and
are widely dispersed hamlets and farmsteads. The
rural community system was part of a hierarchy of
interrelated site types. At the base of the hierarchy were
the short-term camps used for resource exploitation
and the dispersed hamlets and farmsteads. Next in the

Within the Cypress Creek Basin, large settlements
(larger than 4.5 acres [1.8 hectares]) account for only 4
percent of the sites. The Pilgrim’s Pride site (41CP304),
some 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of the northern
Texas portion of the study area, is a well-studied Titus
Phase site. Residential areas cover between 5 and
10 acres (2 and 4 hectares). The village consisted of
several circular structures, over 100 pit features, refuse
deposits, over 20 burials, and an open plaza. Burials
were interred in house floors, as well as a planned
cemetery that contained 19 burials (Thurmond 1990b).
Mound centers tend to be concentrated along major
drainages and are not found in the study area. Mound
centers are typically located on the floodplain floor of a
major drainage or on an upland projection. Occupations
associated with the mound centers are not found on
the floodplain floor, but rather are located on rises
within the floodplain, terraces, or upland projections
(Perttula 2004). There are three types of Late Caddo
period mounds: temple mounds, burial mounds,
and fire mounds (Kelley 1998; Webb 1959). Mound
centers served civic-ceremonial functions and were
presided over by resident social elites. In part, evidence
for social ranking comes from burials. High status
burials consisted of large shaft tombs with multiple
internments, a high percentage of grave offerings with

12

a great number of arrow points and ceramic vessels,
and the inclusion of specialty grave offerings such as
large Galt-style bifaces. Only males were interred in
this manner (Perttula 2004).
Fifty kilometers (31 miles) west of the middle Texas
portion of the study area, the only Late Caddo period
mound located in either Anderson or Houston counties
is the Frankston Phase A. C. Saunders site (41AN19),
a small 7-foot-high (2.2-meter-high) mound covering
approximately 9,230 square feet (858 square meters).
The mound probably represents a fire temple (Jackson
1936; Kleinschmidt 1982). Small mound centers within
the Titus phase area lack either burial mounds or large
platform mounds. Instead, the mounds appear to bury
burned structures.
Late Caddo period people buried their dead in a
variety of ways. Children in particular were interred
beneath house floors (Perttula 2004), and small family
cemeteries were maintained at hamlets, farmsteads,
and in the larger settlements. In addition, formally
maintained, community or supralocal cemeteries are
extant, with little incidence of burials intruding one
upon another. This suggests that the cemeteries were
planned and periodically expanded (Perttula 1992b).
Family cemeteries contain single, extended interments
with graves placed in rows. Graves have a roughly
east-west orientation. Grave offerings differ by age and
by sex. The fewest number of offerings were included
in children’s burials while the greatest numbers were
buried with adults. Males tended to be buried with
clusters of arrow points, while females were buried
with polishing stones or ceramic vessels (Thurmond
1990b). Community cemeteries contained individuals
from nearby communities. They typically contain 60 to
70 individuals, but some have as many as 150 to 300
individuals (Perttula 1992a; Perttula and Nelson 1998;
Story 1990; Turner 1978). At the Tuck Carpenter site
(41CP5), 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of the study
area and dating from a.d. 1350 to 1550 and the H.R.
Taylor site (41HS3) 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the
middle Texas portion of the study area researchers have
found evidence for the segregation of graves based on
status (Perttula 1992a; Turner 1978).
The material culture of the Late Caddo period is rich,
particularly in decorated ceramics and adorned luxury
items. Ceramics from previous periods were heavily
influenced by Lower Mississippi Valley traditions. It
was not until ca. a.d. 700 to 900 that Caddo ceramics
dominated the assemblages of northeastern Texas.

Even so, Lower Mississippi Valley styles remained
highly influential (Story 1990). There was a plethora
of vessel types including bowls, bottles, and jars with
a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and embellishment.
Caddo pottery makers produced both utility wares and
fine wares. Ceramics appear to have had an importance
in Caddo life for cooking and serving food and drink,
for storing foodstuffs, as personal possessions, and as
exemplars of beauty and craftsmanship. Furthermore,
Caddo ceramics served as status markers for subgroups
within the society (David et al. 1988; Thurmond 1985).
The reader is referred to Perttula (2004) for an over­
view of Caddo ceramics.
A variety of artifacts have been recovered from Late
Caddo period sites. Earspools were made of ceramics
and slate, and in one case, they were plated with
copper. Elbow and biconical pipes were decorated
with incised lines painted with hematite or kaolin
clay (Jackson 1933; Turner 1992). Lithic tools and
debris are most conspicuous because of their relative
scarcity. This probably reflects a shift to utilization of
bone and wood for tool manufacture. Chipped stone
tools include triangular and corner-notched arrow
points, flake tools, drills, and scrapers. Ground stone
implements include petaloid and tabular celts, manos
and metates, abrading slabs, and battered and polished
cobbles and pebbles (Thurmond 1990a; Turner 1992).
Bone tools include beamers, punches, awls, pins, and
rattles for turtle carapaces. Exotic materials such as
lithic raw materials and Gulf Coast shells suggest that
trade existed between the Caddo rural communities
and the larger population centers. In addition, people
of the Caddo Cultural area maintained trade links with
horticulturalists in the southwestern U.S., as well as
the Southern Plains and the Lower Mississippi Valley
(Baugh 1998; Kidder 1998).

Historic cAddo Period
(A.d. 1542–1835)
Spanish explorers first encountered the rural Caddo
communities of northeastern Texas in 1542 when
Luis de Moscoso led a group of men attempting to
find central Mexico following the death of their leader
Hernando De Soto (Glover 1935). While a long hiatus
then ensued between contacts with Europeans, Caddo
culture was affected by the introduction of trade goods
and new epidemic diseases. In 1679 the Spanish
stationed a group of soldiers at Caddo Lake, which
later became the now vanished town of Port Caddo. At

Texas Antiquities Permit Report
the time of Moscoso’s contact the Caddo organized as
confederacies within the Caddo culture area. Prior to
European contact, the Hasinai Caddo groups occupied
permanent settlements along the Neches and Angelina
River basins. They continued to live in this region until
the Republic of Texas removed them in 1836.
Beginning in the late seventeenth century, with the
intrusion by La Salle into the Hasinai territory in
the 1680s, Caddo groups in northeast Texas found
themselves caught in the rivalry between the Spanish to
the west and the French to the east. French traders were
in residence at many of the major Caddo settlements by
the mid-eighteenth century. The Caddo thus dwelled
on the edges of both the “Horse Frontier” and “Gun
Frontier.” Native American groups to the west had
horses, but no guns, while groups to the east had guns
but no horses. For a time, Caddo groups exploited
this situation by expanding their hunting territories
to the west using both guns and horses, and at times
serving as middle men to provide guns and horses to
those in need. In addition, they became involved with
the European fur trade, mainly supplying buffalo and
deerskins. The Caddo also engaged in the Apache
slave trade. The Caddo traded Apache children for
European goods at the French and Spanish markets at
Natchitoches and Los Adaes. Their economic stature
and skill as mediators made them desirable partners for
both the French and Spanish, manifested in annual gifts
to the Caddo from both European powers.
Population upheavals further altered the character of
the Caddo heartland. Displacement in north Texas of
Wichita speaking tribes resulted in an alliance with
the Hasinai in the margins of the Post Oak Savanna
of present north-central Texas and south-central
Oklahoma. Caddo populations were greatly reduced
by epidemics and decimated groups merged with one
another. At the same time southeastern U.S. tribes
(Biloxi, Alabama, Coushatta, Choctaw, and Cherokee)
sought and were granted permission to resettle in the
old Caddo heartland after being displaced from their
lands by Anglo settlers. Between 1836 and 1842, the
Hasinai, Nadaco, and Cadohadacho Caddo groups
were forced from east Texas. Some moved west of
the Brazos River for a short time before being forcibly
relocated to west-central Indian Territory (present-day
Oklahoma).

Historic Period
The Project APE falls within the Northeast Texas
Region. The Northeast Texas Region includes
Fannin, Lamar, Delta, Hopkins, Franklin, Wood, and
Upshur counties. Spanish and French exploration and
settlement in the Northeast Texas Region was largely
limited in comparison to other regions of the state.
The French had established relations with the Native
American tribes along the Red River in Lamar County
by 1720, but their presence there was limited (Ludeman
2008). French colonists were more active in modern
Bowie County, where they established Le Poste des
Cadodaquious after 1719. French from that outpost
possibly began exploring modern Franklin County,
but the precise course of their ventures is unclear
(Harper 2008). French explorer François Hervey
explored parts of modern Delta County in 1750, but
he did not establish a permanent settlement in the
region (McCroskey 2008a). Spanish explorers were
also present in the area, with the most notable of these
being Pedro Vial. Vial passed through Wood County
during his trip from Natchitoches, Louisiana, to San
Antonio in 1788. Tracts in the Northeast Texas Region
were given as Spanish land grants, but permanent
settlements never materialized from these initiatives
(Gilbreath 2008).
When the United States purchased French Louisiana
from Napoleon in 1803, President Thomas Jefferson
dispatched the Freeman & Custis Expedition in 1806 to
explore its drainage and resources. As a result, the Red
River became a trade corridor between the Mississippi
and Santa Fe, and American farmers and slaves settled
its north and south banks in present Lamar and Red
River counties (Flores 2009). The region was largely
populated along the Red River by Euro-American
southerners primarily from Tennessee, when the
successive governments of Spain, Mexico, and Texas
opened the region to grants and colonization. Between
1815 and 1836, limited groups of colonists and their
slaves established settlements across the seven-county
area. While the colonists readily enlisted in the Texas
Army during the Texas Revolution, this region of the
state hosted no military action during the conflict.
The Republic of Texas facilitated trade within and
outside the region through its extension of the Central
National Road from the Trinity River (present Dallas)
northeast to the Red River (north of present Clarksville)
for connections to Indian Territory, Arkansas and
beyond (Williams 2009). County units were established

14

Cultural Resources Inventory of the Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast Project in Texas

by the government of Texas variously between 1837
and 1875. Several of the smaller counties in the region,
such as Delta and Franklin, were carved out of other,
pre-existing counties. These actions were generally the
result of complaints to the Texas State Legislature after
1846 regarding the inefficiency of local government
(Gilbert 2008; Gilbreth 2008; Harper 2008; Kirby
2008; Ludeman 2008; McCroskey 2008a; Pigott 2008).
The Civil War brought about many changes to the
region, as the war drained its manpower, capital, and
resources. The majority of the counties in the area did
have a fair number of voters against secession, but the
majority of the populations in these counties supported
the Confederate cause (Gilbert 2008; Gilbreth 2008;
Harper 2008; Kirby 2008; Ludeman 2008; McCroskey
2008a; Pigott 2008).
All of the counties in the Northeast Texas region
contributed men and supplies to Confederacy.
Bonham, in Fannin County, was the site of the military
headquarters for the Northern Subdistrict of Texas, and
a confederate hospital and commissary (Pigott 2008).
Confederate troops were trained at Camp Tally in
Upshur County (Kirby 2008) and Persimmon Grove
in Lamar County. Citizens in Delta County captured
and hanged three union soldiers who fled engagements
in Arkansas (McCroskey 2008a).
The slave population rapidly expanded as southern
slaveholders sent their human property west into the
region to avoid them being freed by Union troops. The
area also sheltered refugees who fled the advancing
Union troops during the war. After the war the Ku
Klux Klan was particularly effective in intimidating the
region’s newly freed slaves, ensuring that caucasians
held onto the region’s political power (Gilbert 2008;
Gilbreth 2008; Harper 2008; Kirby 2008; Ludeman
2008; McCroskey 2008b; Pigott 2008).
While many African-American Texans moved
after the war to the outskirts of cities to establish
“freedmantowns,” thousands created rural farming
communities now called “freedom colonies.” These
independent Texans centered their social lives on
rural church buildings, which resulted in adjacent
cemeteries, later joined by rural community school
buildings funded by the Rosenwald Foundation of
Chicago (Sitton and Conrad 2005).
The construction of railroads in the 1870s through the
1890s in the Northeast Texas region helped to attract
settlers and provide new markets for the region’s

cotton and other agricultural goods. The first rail line
to penetrate the area was the Southern Pacific (no
relation to the later transcontinental SP), which built
through part of Upshur County in 1870 (Kirby 2008).
Other rail lines, such as the Texas & Pacific (1876),
The Gulf, Colorado, & Santa Fe (1887), as well as
some locally constructed lines such as the East Line
& Red River (1880) and the Texas Midland (1897),
provided additional outlets for the area’s goods (Reed
1941). Construction of these corridors inspired many
settlements and towns, but also attracted new farmers
and farming industries, thus the region remained largely
rural and predominately agricultural (Gilbert 2008;
Gilbreth 2008; Harper 2008; Kirby 2008; Ludeman
2008; McCroskey 2008a, 2008b; Pigott 2008).
The successful cotton farming decades of the 1890s
through the early 1920s brought prosperity to rural
northeast Texans and their ubiquitous small-town
service centers. Troubles with weather, depleted soils,
and boll weevils led to scientific farming techniques
that increased production across the decades leading to
and including World War I. During these years, county
seats and many other towns that served rail junctions
or cotton gathering spots gained concentrations of
permanent commercial, religious, and residential
buildings of durable materials—native pine from
Central East Texas, and often brick or stone depending
on regional suppliers—skillfully designed and built by
itinerant architects and craftsmen (Britton et al. 2009).
The agricultural slump of the late 1920s and the Great
Depression after 1930 hit the region hard as farm
markets withered and unemployment climbed. Many of
these counties saw their local banks fail, and witnessed
a decline in population and the number of farms as
residents left to look for other opportunities (Gilbert
2008; Gilbreth 2008; Harper 2008; Kirby 2008;
Ludeman 2008; McCroskey 2008a, 2008b; Pigott
2008). Tenant farming also declined as sharecroppers
left farms for cities or better growing conditions in
West Texas and beyond.
Oil was discovered in 1931 in Upshur County and
then in Franklin County five years later, yet the vast
majority of the region’s population remained dedicated
to agricultural pursuits (Gilbert 2008; Gilbreth 2008;
Harper 2008; Kirby 2008; Ludeman 2008; McCroskey
2008b; Pigott 2008).
President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal after
1933 offered a number of economic, conservation,
and cultural reform programs, and Texas politicians

Texas Antiquities Permit Report
enthusiastically embraced Roosevelt’s employment
programs. Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) soil
conservation camps were established throughout the
region during the decade to terrace farmlands for better
soil management, including one near Winnsboro, Wood
County (Gilbreath 2008). Construction of good roads
throughout Hopkins County resulted in a Carnation
Milk processing plant in Hopkins County that opened
its land up to large-scale dairy farming, an industry
that has been a staple of that county’s economy ever
since (Gilbert 2008; Wright 1959).
Other federal relief agencies, such as the WPA after
1935, also sought to provide jobs by sponsoring, for
example, road construction projects and rural school
buildings in these counties during the Depression.
The region survived the Depression through federal
improvements to farm life—including schools,
electricity, and sanitation; similar public works in
Northeast Texas towns and cities; widespread highway
improvements; and wage-earner jobs in oilfields.
(Gilbert 2008; Gilbreth 2008; Harper 2008; Kirby
2008; Ludeman 2008; McCroskey 2008b; Pigott 2008).
Fannin County’s native son Sam Rayburn, longtime
Congressman and Speaker of the House of
Representatives by 1940, and his fellow lawmakers
steadily guided New Deal projects to their communities
through the 1930s. When the European war escalated in
1940, Congress authorized a series of military training
camps for draftees, as well as new war industries to
draw heavily on underemployed labor, that profoundly
benefited Northeast Texas during World War II.
Lamar County hosted the Army at Camp Maxey near
Paris, Fannin County received a pilot training airfield
near Bonham, and Lone Star Steel in Morris County
boosted employment across the region (Procter
2009). The era of World War II witnessed another
large drain of the region’s population as many of the
area’s younger citizens sought opportunities in the
larger cities, and then served in the military during
the war. After 1945 many Texans did not return to
these predominantly rural counties, but their urban
populations generally stabilized within each town’s
pre-Depression infrastructure and New Deal civic
improvements (Gilbert 2008; Gilbreth 2008; Harper
2008; Kirby 2008; Ludeman 2008; McCroskey 2008a;
Pigott 2008).
Farming suffered again in the region during the severe
1950s drought, attracting more federal help through
soil conservation projects, and large reservoirs such

15

as Lake Pat Mayse in Lamar County and Lake Fork
in Wood County. These water projects in turn attracted
larger industries by the 1960s to the region, such as
Campbell Soup in Paris, Texas Power & Light to Titus
County, and increased dairy production in Hopkins,
Camp, and Upshur counties.

BAckGround review
The background review consisted of a cultural re­
sources and environmental literature review of the
Project area. An SWCA archaeologist reviewed the cor­
responding USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
maps and records on file with the Texas Archeologi­
cal Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of
Texas at Austin and the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online
database. These sources provided information on the
nature and location of previously conducted cultural re­
sources surveys, previously recorded cultural resource
sites, locations of NRHP districts and properties, sites
designated as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs),
Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), Regis­
tered Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), cemeteries,
and local neighborhood surveys. However, the Atlas
does not necessarily list all previous work conducted
within a specific area. Previous cultural resources in­
vestigations listed on the Atlas are limited to projects
under purview of the ACT and/or Section 106 of the
NHPA of 1966, as amended. In addition, projects under
these regulations may not be posted on Atlas due to
a delay between the completion of field work and the
completion of reports. Other resources such as aerial
photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology maps, and
the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s (NRCS)
Web Soil Surveys, were also examined for historical
and environmental information within the Project area.

field MetHods
The survey area includes Holocene terraces along the
Red River and Pleistocene formations along the valley
margins. The former have potential for deeply buried
deposits requiring backhoe trenching. Shovel testing
was expected to be adequate to access the Pleistocene
terraces, though the methodology was adjusted to
adapt to the field findings and deeper excavations were
conducted as warranted.

16

Cultural Resources Inventory of the Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast Project in Texas

Generally, trenches were 2 meters (m) deep, 8 m in
length, and 1.5 m wide. Stratigraphic profile drawings
with soil descriptions were recorded for each trench
by an experienced archaeologist. Accordingly, the in­
vestigations focused on excavating into the substrate
in search of intact cultural deposits. Any evidence of
cultural materials was recorded and photographed. All
work was performed in accordance with Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (29 CFR
Part 1926) and the Texas Trench Safety Act (H.B.
1569). Appropriate measures were taken for trenches
that exceeded 2 m in depth, utilizing shoring or the
stepping back of sidewalls to ensure that all OSHA
protocols were followed. Once the excavations and
recording was completed, all trenches were backfilled
and leveled.
In addition to trenching, SWCA conducted intensive
pedestrian survey including ground surface inspec­
tion and systematic shovel testing of 5.1 miles of
mainline centerline and 0.625 mile of access roads
that was previously denied for access. Shovel tests
were generally 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and
excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits. Shovel
tests were excavated in arbitrary levels no thicker than
20 cm, with sediments screened through ¼-inch mesh,
unless high clay or water content required troweling.
A Munsell color chart and U.S. Department of Agri­
culture terminology was used to describe stratigraphic
profiles. The location of each shovel test was recorded
using a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS)
unit. The number of shovel tests was contingent upon
the findings during the course of the investigations in
the field. Four previously recorded sites are mapped
within the ACT-permitted area, and two of these were
relocated and assessed relative to the Project footprint.
All cultural resources were appropriately delineated
and documented within the accessible areas.
The survey was conducted in accordance with all
Project survey protocols approved by the THC and
in compliance with the Council of Texas Archeolo­
gists (CTA) survey standards. No artifacts were to be
collected unless circumstances warranted otherwise.
Specifically, if exceptionally fragile or unique items
were discovered and leaving such items on site would
pose an undue risk of loss of information, then the
materials were to be collected. Otherwise, artifacts
were analyzed in the field and left on sites.

The background review identified two formally re­
ported previous investigations within the background
review study area, although a number of historical
reconnaissances and surveys have occurred along the
Red River. The October 21, 2011, Project footprint
parallels both formally reported previous investigations
that consist of recently constructed pipelines collocated
with the proposed Project alignment. As discussed
in greater detail in Carpenter et al. (2010), previous
cultural resources investigations on these lines overlap
portions of the Project ESA covered in this report.
Between January and June of 2007, R.C. Goodwin &
Associates, Inc. surveyed the Gulf Crossing Project,
a 353.2-mile-long and 300-foot-wide corridor within
Grayson, Fannin, Lamar, Delta, Hopkins, Franklin, Ti­
tus, Morris, and Cass counties (Lackowicz et al. 2009).
Approximately 2.5 miles (from MP 156.09 to 158.59) of
the current Project ESA within Fannin County were at
least partially surveyed during the Gulf Crossing Proj­
ect. Subsequent surveys for reroutes, access roads, and
auxiliary facilities were also conducted and presented
in report addendums. In addition, geoarchaeological
reconnaissance and investigations were conducted in
the northern portion of the Gulf Crossing Project in
Fannin County. R.C. Goodwin and Associates, Inc.
recommended additional monitoring during the trench­
ing phase of pipeline construction in Fannin County
from MP 155.68 to 162.00 (Hajic and Mandel 2009).
The investigations encountered 41 new or previously
recorded archaeological sites of which four (41FN41,
41FN51, 41FN82, 41FN83) are mapped within or im­
mediately adjacent to the survey area.
In 2007 and 2008, TRC conducted cultural resources
survey investigations for the Midcontinent Express
Pipeline project across several counties in Texas ad­
jacent to and near the current Project. However, the
results and details of these reports are currently not
available. Archaeological sites 41FN87, 41FN88, and
41FN89 mapped within or immediately adjacent to the
survey area were recorded during these investigations.
Additionally, in 2008 through 2009, HRA Gray and

sources surveys of approximately 2.39 miles of main­

line centerline and 2.91 miles of access road for the cur­
rent Project within Fannin County. At this time, the land
had not yet been acquired by NTMWD; therefore, no
ACT permitting was required. Site 41FN91/41FN87,
a historic artifact scatter associated with prehistoric
lithic debris, was revisited and recorded during this
investigation (Carpenter et al. 2010).

fAnnin county
Sixteen previously recorded cultural resources were
documented within the background review study area
in Fannin County, Texas. These resources consist of
one prehistoric mound site (41FN1), one prehistoric
cemetery (Goss Farm site-41FN12), one prehistoric
hamlet (41FN39), one prehistoric open campsite
(41FN51), four prehistoric artifact scatters (41FN9,
41FN82, 41FN85, and 41FN89), four multicompo­
nent artifact scatters (41FN41, 41FN86, 41FN88, and
41FN91/41FN87), and four historic artifact scatters
(41FN40, 41FN42, 41FN83, and 41FN84).
Of the sixteen archaeological sites, six are located im­
mediately adjacent to the survey area (41FN41, 41FN51,
41FN83, 41FN88, 41FN89, and 41FN91/41FN87) and
two are mapped within the survey area (41FN40 and
41FN82). The six sites immediately adjacent to the
survey area and the two sites mapped within the survey
area are described in detail below.

41FN40
Site 41FN40 is a historic artifact scatter located
mostly in an open plowed field within the Red River
floodplain, just east of the survey area. The site was
originally recorded by HPS Inc. in 1989 for the ENRON
pipeline project. Cultural materials consisted mostly
of indeterminate whiteware, stoneware, and purple
and green glass fragments observed on the surface
across a 54- by 54-m area. Shovel test investigations
were performed across the site and did not encounter
subsurface cultural materials. While the artifacts are
associated with a domestic occupation, no evidence of
structural remains was noted within the site boundaries
(Price 1989).
Site 41FN40 has experienced considerable impacts
due primarily to agricultural-related activities and
subsequent erosion. Several pipelines also traverse
the property, causing further impacts as a result of
construction and ongoing maintenance. The artifact

17

assemblage at site 41FN40 lacked temporally
diagnostic characteristics or maker’s marks, allowing
for only a general age range for the site occupation.
The lack of structural remains or intact buried deposits
suggests that site 41FN40 is a historic trash dump with
no apparent affiliation, a site type common in rural
areas. For these reasons, HPS Inc. determined that site
41FN40 was not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
and that no further investigations were warranted
(Price 1989).

41FN41
Site 41FN41 is a multicomponent site consisting of a
diffuse scatter of prehistoric and historic artifacts that
stretches across a small upland pasture, just east of the
study area. The site was originally recorded by HPS
Inc. in 1989 for the ENRON pipeline project and was
revisited by R.C. Goodwin and Associates in 2007.
Information on the two site forms is somewhat conflict­
ing, as the initial site visit only recorded a prehistoric
component while the 2007 site visit clearly notes the
presence of historic-age artifacts intermixed with the
prehistoric assemblage. This discrepancy is likely a
product of ongoing agricultural activity, which over
time may have exposed and/or buried artifacts result­
ing in the continual shifting of cultural materials. The
site is primarily a surface scatter of prehistoric pottery
fragments and indeterminate lithic materials inter­
mixed with historic-age glass fragments and ceramic
shards. Several non-diagnostic lithic artifacts were
noted in subsurface contexts extending to a depth of 40
centimeters below surface (cmbs). The site boundary,
which measures approximately 80 m north-south by 80
m east-west, was delineated based on the distribution
of surface artifacts as well as positive and negative
shovel tests. Overall, site 41FN41 has experienced
considerable impacts due to agricultural-related ac­
tivities and subsequent erosion. Several pipelines also
traverse the property, causing further impacts as a result
of construction and ongoing maintenance. Neither of
the site forms contains detailed information regard­
ing the observed artifacts, particularly the prehistoric
ceramics. No recommendation of NRHP eligibility for
site41FN41 is stated on either of the site forms.

41FN51
The site was originally recorded by Jerry Henderson
of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
in 1995, when a number of artifacts were observed in
the Farm to Market Road (FM) 79 road cut. The surface

18

Cultural Resources Inventory of the Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast Project in Texas

collection included a projectile point midsection, nine
chert flakes, and a core. Henderson excavated four
shovel tests within the road right-of-way, encountering
shallow clays and no artifacts. Based on this, Hender­
son suggested that the artifacts had eroded down the
face of the road cut from higher on the terrace landform, and that the site had been completely removed
within the right-of-way by roadway construction. The
site form also notes that the surrounding vegetation
is cultivated crops, and that no access was granted
to inspect the site on the adjacent private properties
(Henderson 1995).
Archaeologists with Goodwin & Associates revisited
site 41FN51 in 2008 during a survey for the Gulf
Crossing Project (Lackowicz et al. 2009; McLean
2008). This survey expanded the site boundaries south
of FM 79, creating a site area of 90 m north-south by
165 m east-west. Thirty shovel tests were excavated in
the site area, with 14 positive for prehistoric cultural
materials. The artifact assemblage included 17 pieces
of chert debitage, three pieces of orthoquartzite deb­
itage, one utilized chert flake, and one fire-cracked
rock. Artifacts were recovered from just below the
surface to a depth of 30 cm, but no surface artifacts
are mentioned in the site form (Lackowicz et al. 2009;
McLean 2008). More significant was a lens of ash and
charcoal noted at 20 to 25 cmbs in one test, interpreted
as a possible hearth feature. Based on the presence of
this feature and the potential for dateable charcoal and
other features, Goodwin & Associates recommended
the site as potentially eligible for NRHP listing, and
recommended avoidance or further excavations. The
site was subsequently avoided by the Gulf Crossing
Project.

41FN82
Site 41FN82 is a small surficial prehistoric artifact
scatter located in an upland plowed field, mapped
within the boundaries of the current survey area. The
site was originally recorded by R.C. Goodwin and
Associates in 2007 for the Gulf Crossing project.
According to the site form, site 41FN82 consists
of a surface scatter of thirteen lithic fragments, one
hammerstone, and three shell fragments across a 10by 10-m area. No cultural materials were observed in
subsurface contexts. Investigations were restricted to
the Project area, so the site was not delineated beyond
the boundaries of the Project area. There is a possibility
that the site extends beyond the currently defined
boundaries (Cropley 2007a).

The site assemblage lacks temporally diagnostic
artifacts, although the general artifact types are
associated with prehistoric populations. The site
form describes the cultural materials as scattered
and limited in variety. The site has also likely been
considerably impacted by agricultural-related activity
and subsequent erosion, reducing site integrity. No
recommendation of NRHP eligibility for site 41FN82
is stated on the site form (Cropley 2007a). However,
judging by the lack of intact buried deposits or
temporally diagnostic artifacts, it can be surmised that
site 41FN82 has little to no research value within the
recorded boundaries.

41FN83
Site 41FN83 was originally recorded in 2007 by Good­
win & Associates during a survey for the Gulf Crossing
pipeline (Lackowicz et al. 2009). A scatter of historic
artifacts was identified covering an area 70 m northsouth by 80 m east-west. The assemblage included 57
pieces of glass, seven metal fragments, three mortar
fragments, and two historic ceramic sherds. Artifacts
were recovered in shovel tests from 0 to 40 cmbs. An
existing pipeline was running through the site area
and had disturbed portions of the site. The site was
determined to be not eligible for listing on the NRHP
(Cropley 2007b).

41FN87
Site 41FN87 is a prehistoric and historic scatter located
on a terrace above a minor tributary to Bois d’Arc
Creek. Recorded in 2007 by TRC for the MidContinent
Express Pipeline, the site form describes the surface
and subsurface deposits as a light prehistoric scatter
and moderately dense historic scatter. Pedestrian sur­
vey and shovel test delineation of the site identified a
60- by 40-m area boundary (Duckworth 2007).
The site assemblage contains temporally diagnostic
historic artifacts, but does not contain diagnostic pre­
historic artifacts. The site form lists historic materials
typical of an 1880 to 1916 time period for the historic
activity at 41FN87. The site is described as contain­
ing subsurface materials to 35 cmbs, with none of the
deposits intact due to various heavy disturbances. With
no further work recommended and low research value
attributed to this site, 41FN87 does not warrant SAL
or NRHP eligibility (Duckworth 2007).

Texas Antiquities Permit Report

41FN88
Site 41FN88 is a prehistoric and historic scatter located
on an alluvial terrace of the Red River. Recorded in
2007 by TRC for the MidContinent Express Pipeline,
the site form describes the surface and subsurface scat­
ter as a light prehistoric and historic scatter. Pedestrian
survey and shovel test delineation of the site identified
an 80- by 40-m area boundary. The site assemblage
contains temporally diagnostic historic artifacts, but
does not contain diagnostic prehistoric artifacts. The
site form lists historic materials typical of an 1880 to
1916 time period for the historic activity at 41FN88.
The site is described as containing subsurface materials
to 30 cmbs, with none of the deposits intact due to vari­
ous heavy disturbances. With no further work recom­
mended and low research value attributed to this site,
41FN88 does not warrant SAL or NRHP eligibility.

41FN89
Site 41FN89 is a small prehistoric scatter located on
an alluvial terrace of the Red River. Recorded in 2007
by TRC for the MidContinent Express Pipeline, this
site form describes the strictly subsurface scatter as
a prehistoric scatter containing lithic tools, debitage,
pottery, fire-cracked rock (FCR), and burned clay.
Pedestrian survey and shovel test delineation of the
site identified a 30- by 10-m area boundary. The site
assemblage contains temporally diagnostic prehis­
toric artifacts, but no cultural period is assigned on
the 2007 site form. Based on the temper types within
the pottery from 41FN89, Late Prehistoric activity is
most likely represented by the artifact assemblage.
The site is described as containing subsurface materi­
als to 5 to 75 cmbs, with none of the deposits intact
due to various heavy disturbances. No further work is
recommended and a low research value is attributed to
this site, however it seems that 41FN89 may contain
the potential to yield significant information based on
the depth of deposits and diagnostic artifacts recorded
during shovel testing.

41FN91
HRA G&P identified site 41FN91, a historic artifact
scatter associated with prehistoric lithic debris, in July
2008 during intensive pedestrian survey for the current
Project. Upon identifying buried cultural material, the
site boundary was delineated by placing 17 shovel tests
at 10- to 20-m intervals on north-south and east-west
axes radiating from the central positive shovel test.

19

Eight shovel tests yielded cultural material. Multiple
historic ceramic fragments, amethyst glass shards, and
square-cut nails were observed both on the surface
and in subsurface contexts. Among recovered historic
ceramic fragments, one bore a maker’s mark reading
“Edwin” and several others were variably identified as
Albany Slip stoneware and black transfer-print whiteware. These artifacts suggest a middle to late nineteenth
century date range for the site’s historic component,
but its prehistoric chronology is unknown. Prehistoric
artifacts were limited to two non-diagnostic lithic flakes
on the surface (Ponder 2008).
The site yielded dateable middle to late nineteenth
century historic components in potentially intact sub­
surface deposits, as well as prehistoric surface debris.
Although these non-diagnostic prehistoric materials
are not dateable, this site may provide information
significant to the region’s prehistory and history. HRA
G&P recommended further testing to fully evaluate
the site for its NRHP eligibility. As such, HRA G&P
recommended the site undetermined for inclusion in
the NRHP until further subsurface testing can be con­
ducted (Ponder 2008).
Subsequent research indicates that this site is actually
part of previously recorded site 41FN87 (Carpenter et
al. 2010). This site was recommended not eligible for
NRHP listing due to heavily disturbed deposits.

lAmAr county
Nine previously recorded cultural resources are located
within the background review study area in Lamar
County, Texas. The Sanders site (41LR2) is a multi­
component Caddo village and mound site recorded and
investigated in the 1930s by the University of Texas
at Austin. Site 41LR2 also includes a historic Native
American artifact scatter and a later possible early to
middle-twentieth century farmstead. The remaining
previously recorded sites in Lamar County consist of
one prehistoric cemetery (O. K. Goosby site-41LR8),
one prehistoric artifact scatter (41LR313), three mul­
ticomponent artifact scatters (41LR311, 41LR312, and
41LR314), one historic homestead (41LR122), and
two historic artifact scatters (41LR133 and 41LR356).
Of these nine archaeological sites, only two (41LR2
and 41LR314) are located immediately adjacent to the
survey area. These two sites are described in detail
below; however, neither site falls within the ACTpermitted Project ESA.

41LR2
41LR2 is a Caddo village and mound site situated
on the eastern banks of Bois d’Arc Creek covering
a 10-acre area including portions of the Red River
terraces and bordering uplands located in far north­
western Lamar County, Texas. The site also includes
a historic Native American artifact scatter and a later
possible early to middle-twentieth century farmstead.
Designated the Sanders site, it was first recorded by
R. K. Harris and Hanna in 1928, and more thoroughly
investigated by the University of Texas in 1931. The
site is a large Caddo village with occupations associ­
ated with the Sanders Focus, dating to a.d. 1300 to
1400, and the Norteño Focus, a historical contact-era
believed to date to the late 1600s to early 1700s. Two
mounds are present in the northern part of the site, the
smaller of which was excavated by A.T. Jackson dur­
ing the 1931 investigations. A larger village midden
covers the remainder of the site area. Cemeteries as­
sociated with both foci are present and were excavated.
Artifacts recovered from the original investigations
include a large sample of ceramics, stone tools (in­
cluding projectile points), scrapers, drills, bone tools,
and glass trade beads. A revisit to the site in 1970 by
Patrick Flannery noted that the entire site was plowed
consequently reducing the size of the smaller mound.
Nonetheless, the site condition was noted as excellent
(41LR2 State of Texas site form). The Sanders site
is the type site for the Sanders Focus, defined on the
basis of unique pottery and grave goods recovered by
Jackson’s investigations.
SWCA has conducted various field efforts on the por­
tion of site 41LR2 within the current larger Project
between 2008 and 2012. The extension of the Sand­
ers site identified by SWCA consists of a prehistoric
occupation and historic scatter . The area is currently
pasture, with mixed grasses throughout and mixed
hardwood trees along the northern and northwestern
fence lines. The southwesternmost portion of the site
is within a Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) property
and is forested with mixed riparian hardwoods. Surface
visibility ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Soils throughout
the site consist primarily of brown loamy sand gener­
ally underlain by light brown loamy sand and, at greater
depths, brown to gray clay. Previous impacts to the area
are moderate, primarily from years of plowing prior
to the conversion to pasture lands. Additional impacts
include fence line construction, erosion, cattle grazing
and trampling, looting, and gopher bioturbation.

SWCA’s initial investigation on October 21, 2008, as­
sessed the March 15, 2010, Project footprint (Carpenter
et al. 2010). The 2008 investigations extended the site
southward from its original boundaries. Both prehis­
toric and historic cultural materials were observed
along the site surface and recovered from 14 positive
shovel tests out of a total of 34 shovel tests excavated
(Carpenter et al. 2010). The 41LR2 2008 extension
was deemed eligible for the NRHP and avoidance
was recommended by SWCA (Carpenter et al. 2010).
Deed research indicated that the historic component is
not associated with prominent individuals, events, or
places (Carpenter et al. 2010).
The prehistoric subsurface artifact assemblage re­
covered during the 2008 survey includes two incised
stones, a burnishing stone, five ceramic sherds, six
small burned clay fragments, one white chert biface
fragment, 19 chert flakes, and 12 pieces of FCR (Car­
penter et al. 2010). Multiple flakes and charcoal were
also found on the site surface. The historic subsurface
artifact assemblage encountered consists of one pearlware fragment with blue floral design, one ceramic
sherd with black glaze on both sides, one whiteware
fragment, several pieces of crude unglazed redware,
one brown glass snuff lid fragment, two brown glass
fragments, four clear glass fragments, one glass flake,
one curved metal bucket handle, one metal barb, one
square-head nail, one wire nail, and two cross-mend­
able pieces of a porcelain ring insulator (Carpenter et
al. 2010). A stoneware bottle mount was observed on
the site surface.
SWCA’s subsequent effort on October 26 and 28-29,
2010, surveyed the June 10, 2011, footprint to assess
a reroute south of the previous original survey area
(Acuña et al. 2013). The 38 shovel tests excavated,
of which 16 encountered prehistoric and/or historic
cultural materials, revealed the site connects with the
previously recorded area of 41LR2 and it continues
south and southwest along the terraces of Bois d’Arc
Creek extending south to FM 79 (Acuña et al. 2013).
All of the positive shovel tests were located in the
survey area portion nearest to the creek, and as the
survey continued east of the fence line all tests were
negative indicating the site is more narrowly focused
along Bois d’Arc Creek in this area (Acuña et al. 2013).
SWCA recommended site 41LR2, including the newly
recorded 2010 southwest extension, eligible for NRHP
listing (Acuña et al. 2013).

Texas Antiquities Permit Report
The prehistoric subsurface artifact assemblage recov­
ered during the 2010 survey includes two ceramic
sherds, five small burned clay fragments, one possible
piece of red ochre, a possible hammerstone, a utilized
flake scraper, an edge-modified flake, 54 pieces of
debitage, and four pieces of burned rock (Acuña et
al. 2013). The debitage assemblage includes 31 chert
flakes and shatter, 22 quartzite flakes, and one petrified
wood flake. The historic subsurface artifact assemblage
consists of one whiteware sherd, two milk glass frag­
ments, two brown glass fragments, eight clear glass
fragments, one square-head nail, and three wire nails
(Acuña et al. 2013). No artifacts were noted on the
site surface.
In addition to the intensive pedestrian survey in 2010,
an area included in the WRP was investigated by
SWCA through reconnaissance survey, as no shovel
testing was allowed per the WRP easement agreement.
Prehistoric artifacts were observed in two looting spoils
piles in this area, including two ceramic sherds, a
groundstone fragment, a core, a flake, and three FCR.
These are not included in the assemblage discussed
above, but their presence was also used to extend the
site boundaries (Acuña et al. 2013).
The prehistoric components of SWCA site extensions
for 41LR2 are clearly associated with the Caddo
components of the larger Sanders site, although the
prevalence of lithic debitage and relative paucity of
ceramics may indicate a discrete activity area or a
possible pre-Caddo component in this area (Acuña et
al. 2013; Carpenter et al. 2010). The upper deposits of
the site have been affected by plowing, but the lower
deposits ranging from 40 to 85 cmbs with some cultural
material concentration observed from 40 to 60 cmbs,
appear undisturbed for the most part suggesting that
intact prehistoric deposits may be present (Acuña et
al. 2013; Carpenter et al. 2010). The prehistoric com­
ponents are considered contributing elements to the
probable NRHP eligibility of the Sanders site (Acuña
et al. 2013; Carpenter et al. 2010). This site has already
contributed significant information for understanding
the prehistory of the region and has great potential to
yield additional significant information.
The historic component of SWCA site extensions for
41LR2 is largely confined to the shallow subsurface
sediments with cultural materials recovered from the
upper 40 cm of sediments within the plow zone (Acuña
et al. 2013; Carpenter et al. 2010). In some shovel tests,
prehistoric artifacts (i.e., lithic debitage) were observed

21

within the same levels as historic artifacts indicating
mixed deposits and providing additional evidence
for past plowing (Acuña et al. 2013; Carpenter et al.
2010). The history of farming at the site, as well as the
wide temporal range of artifacts identified at the site,
suggests that the upper deposits represent multiple
occupations over a lengthy period of time that have
undergone mixing (Acuña et al. 2013; Carpenter et
al. 2010).
More recent investigations on the Sanders site on be­
half of the landowner were conducted in 2011 (Perttula
and Marceaux 2011). For this investigation, the land­
owner requested an independent survey effort within
a 300-m section of the proposed Project mainline that
parallels FM 79. The survey efforts consisted of the
excavation of a total 16 shovel tests, five of which con­
tained cultural materials from 0 to 45 cmbs. Recovered
artifacts included one ceramic sherd, a piece of burned
clay, eight pieces of lithic debris, and one piece of FCR
(Perttula and Marceaux 2011). While SWCA’s efforts
in this exact area produced negative results (Carpen­
ter et al. 2010), the 2011 study concluded that intact
prehistoric Caddo archaeological deposits from the
Sanders site are present within this area.
Additionally, due to engineering constraints associated
with the limitations of horizontal directional drilling
(HDD), avoidance of a small peripheral portion of site
41LR2 by the Project was not feasible. As a result,
significance testing efforts were warranted in this
portion of the site to ensure that the proposed opentrenching activities associated with the Project would
have no adverse effects on any significant cultural
materials in this area, namely undocumented human
remains or structural features (Carpenter et al. 2013).
Accordingly, field efforts were designed to assess
archaeological deposits within the Project construc­
tion footprint located along FM 79 in the far southern
portion of the site. Although the site is located beyond
USACE jurisdictional areas and is outside the purview
of Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, these efforts
were conducted in coordination with the THC and the
Caddo Nation (Carpenter et al. 2013).
SWCA conducted significance testing field investiga­
tions between September and October 2012, utilizing
a multi-tiered approach that included a magnetometry
and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey, mechani­
cal scraping, and the hand excavation of 24 1×1-m
units. In all, a total of 15.66 cubic meters of sediment
was excavated. The magnetometer and GPR survey

22

Cultural Resources Inventory of the Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast Project in Texas

identified three anomalies (later determined to be only
two). An additional 11 anomalies were identified during
the mechanical scraping and an additional two anoma­
lies were identified within the excavation units. All of
these anomalies were determined to be non-cultural
disturbances such as animal burrows, relict drainage
channels etched into the argillic substrate, or root casts
(Carpenter et al. 2013).
No ceramics, arrow points, or other diagnostic artifacts
associated with the Sanders site’s periods of signifi­
cance were identified. Mechanical scraping and hand
excavations on the site yielded a total of 117 artifacts,
including 115 prehistoric artifacts and two historic
or modern metal fragments. Overall, the prehistoric
assemblage consists primarily of lithic debitage and
thermally fractured rock, which composes 85 percent
of the prehistoric assemblage. Diagnostic artifacts,
including a Gary and a Kent dart point, indicate sparse
Woodland components. No evidence of post molds,
cooking features, or activity areas typical of Caddo
settlements were discovered during the testing efforts.
The significance investigations did not identify fea­
tures, artifacts, or components that contribute to the
site’s NRHP eligibility (Carpenter et al. 2013). Based
on the lack of intact archaeological deposits or com­
ponents that contribute to the NRHP eligibility of the
Sanders site, the Project will have no adverse effect
on the historic property. No further work was recom­
mended by SWCA (Carpenter et al. 2013).
An interim report that details the findings from the
significance testing efforts was submitted to the THC
for review and comment on January 11, 2013. The THC
concurred with SWCA recommendations on February
11, 2013, and stated that the portion of the Sanders site
within the Project ESA does not constitute an eligible
component of the site. This was followed by SWCA’s
submittal of a draft final report of the findings to the
THC in November 2013 and distribution of such to the
necessary agencies and interested parties.

41LR314
Site 41LR314 is a prehistoric and historic artifact
scatter in a disturbed surficial and subsurface context
initially identified in the northwestern corner of Lamar
County by SWCA in November 2008 during intensive
pedestrian survey for the current larger Project (Car­
penter et al. 2010). The Red River is approximately 2
kilometers (km) to the north and Bois d’Arc Creek is
300 m west. The site is situated on the east side slope of

a slight north–south-trending rise. The majority of the
site is located in an active agricultural field, extending
into moderately wooded areas to the south, west, and
northwest. Surface visibility in the recently harvested
field is excellent (100 percent), with poor (5–10 per­
cent) visibility in the surrounding wooded area due
to heavy leaf litter. Soils consist of deep silty sand
greater than 100 cm in depth. The main impact to the
site is plowing of the agricultural field, although some
deposits may be intact beneath the plow zone. Other
impacts include a pipeline under construction along
the western edge of the site, vegetation clearing, and
erosion. A non-historic barn and two-track driveway
is located just east of the site.
In total, 68 shovel tests were excavated in the site area.
Fifteen of these were positive; one had exclusively
historic artifacts 35 to 70 cmbs while the remaining
14 recovered exclusively prehistoric materials con­
centrated at 45 to 75 cmbs. In addition to the artifacts
in the plowed field and shovel tests, a large amount
of historic and prehistoric material was observed in
the disturbed pipeline corridor. Based on the distribu­
tion of surface materials and positive shovel tests, the
site measures roughly 270 m north-south by at least
240 m east-west, although delineation could not be
completed to the west due to a no-access property
(Carpenter et al. 2010). Historic artifacts, primarily
a surface manifestation, consist of a broad range of
colored glass, decorated ceramics, a file, and a nail.
Prehistoric artifacts consist of ceramic sherds, lithic
tools and lithic debitage, including a Trinity dart point
dating from the Middle to Late Archaic period (Turner
and Hester 1999), an untyped dart point, and a pecked
groundstone.
The historic component, dating to the late nineteenth
to early twentieth century, consists of a disturbed sur­
face scatter in a plowed field and pipeline corridor. A
limited subsurface component likely indicates use of
a pit or depression for dumping. SWCA recommended
the historic component of site 41LR314 not eligible for
NRHP listing under Criteria A and B, as the historic
component of the site is contained entirely within a
highly disturbed area and any associations with his­
torically significant events or persons are likely lost
(Carpenter et al. 2010). Criterion C is not applicable as
the site lacks a structural component (Carpenter et al.
2010). The historic component is also recommended
not eligible under Criterion D, as the plow zone and
construction disturbance have severely impacted the

Texas Antiquities Permit Report

23

already low research potential of the site (Carpenter
et al. 2010).

in areas with greater than 30 percent surface visibility
and slopes greater than 20 percent.

The prehistoric component of site 41LR314 is consid­
erably more extensive in size than the historic compo­
nent of the site. Limited shovel testing conducted at the
site revealed a concentration of prehistoric artifacts at
approximately 45 to 70 cmbs in uniform loose sands,
although artifacts were recovered from 0 to 80 cmbs.
While the majority of the site lies within a plowed
field, this artifact recovery zone may indicate intact
deposits below surface disturbances. The artifacts
recovered have the potential to provide further infor­
mation regarding prehistoric occupations of the area,
and the site may be related to the significant Caddo
village site 41LR2 to the north. Due to the perceived
integrity of the site deposits as well as high research
value, SWCA recommended the prehistoric component
of site 41LR314 undetermined eligibility under Cri­
terion D (Carpenter et al. 2010). Further excavations
were recommended to thoroughly assess the integrity
and the significance of the deposits. The site is avoided
by the March 15, 2010, Project footprint (Carpenter
et al. 2010).

Seven cultural resources including two newly recorded
archaeological sites (41FN94 and 41FN144), two
previously recorded archaeological sites (41FN51 and
41FN83), one newly recorded historic-age architectural
resource (CHSS7BFN101.001), and two newly re­
corded prehistoric isolated finds (CIF6BFN11.001 and
CIF6BFN11.002) were identified during the cultural
resources investigations within the ACT-permitted
Project APE (Table 3). Site 41FN51 is a multicom­
ponent site with prehistoric and historic components.
The historic component is not NRHP or SAL eligible,
whereas the prehistoric component is of undetermined
eligibility. Sites 41FN83 and 41FN94 are historic ar­
tifact scatters, neither of which is eligible for NRHP
listing or for designation as a SAL within the Project
APE. The architectural resource, CHSS7BFN101.001,
consists of a historic-age corral complex associated
with a cattle sale yard and that may be a contributing
element to the larger Riverby Ranch. The historic
resource complex is of undetermined NRHP and SAL
eligibility requiring an assessment of the larger historic
ranch with which it is associated to make a clear eligi­
bility determination. Site 41FN144 is an unanticipated
discovery consisting of a prehistoric Caddo artifact
scatter inadvertently disturbed during the construction
phase of the Project. The eligibility of the site for listing
in the NRHP and designation as a SAL is undetermined.
The prehistoric isolated finds consist of one quartzite
biface fragment (CIF6BFN11.001) and one petrified
wood secondary flake (CIF6BFN11.002). Isolated finds
are not NRHP or SAL eligible.

field survey
SWCA covered 5.1 miles of mainline centerline cul­
tural resources inventory during the current investiga­
tions within the ACT-permitted portion of the Project
(Figures 3 and 4). Additionally, 0.625 mile of access
roads was also investigated. Investigations included
intensive pedestrian survey with ground surface inspec­
tion and shovel testing, as well as backhoe trenching
in select areas with the potential for deeply buried de­
posits. Eleven backhoe trenches were excavated within
an approximately 1.9-mile section of the APE (Figure
5; Table 2). All backhoe trenches were negative for
cultural materials. The THC/CTA survey standards for
projects of this size recommend 16 shovel tests per mile
within a 100-foot-wide corridor for linear surveys. By
this standard, 168.6 shovel tests were required within
the remaining 3.2 miles of 300-foot-wide mainline
centerline ESA and 0.625 mile of approximately 150­
foot wide access road ESA not included in the backhoe
trenching investigations. In all, SWCA excavated a
total of 219 shovel tests across the Project area, ex­
ceeding THC/CTA survey standards (Appendix A).
Of the 219 shovel tests excavated, 20 were positive
for cultural material. Shovel tests were not excavated

Additionally, two previously recorded sites (41FN40
and 41FN82) are mapped within the ACT-permitted
Project ESA. The two sites were not relocated within
the mainline Project ESA during the current investi­
gations, although artifacts likely associated with such
were observed adjacent to the survey area during the
intensive pedestrian survey. Both of these sites are in
areas with high surface visibility, approaching 100 per­
cent. A number of negative shovel tests were excavated
in the vicinity of site 41FN40 during the initial round of
survey, and did not relocate the site within the Project
ESA. A backhoe trench excavated 50 m northwest did
not encounter any cultural materials either (see Table
2). Likewise, a backhoe trench excavated just west
of the site 41FN82 boundaries did not identify any
cultural materials. Another two previously recorded

sites (41FN41 and 41FN88) are mapped immediately
adjacent to the ACT-permitted Project ESA. Similarly,
the investigations revealed no components associated
with these two previously recorded sites within the
Project access road CAR-475 survey area previously
investigated in November 2008 prior to acquirement of
the lands by NTMWD. These two are likely the same
site recorded twice by different projects. Therefore, it
was determined that none of these four sites extends
into the Project ESA.

logical investigations on the Red River terraces in Fan­
nin County (Hajic and Mandel 2009). They identified
four terraces, designated T1 through T4, from lowest
to highest and youngest to oldest, respectively. Ad­
ditionally, a lower flood terrace, though unnumbered,
was identified near the current river channel. The

geoarchaeological investigations were based on two
core samples, one on the flood terrace and one on the
T2 terrace. None was placed on the T1 terrace in this
portion of the line, and so their conclusions regarding
the archaeological potential on the T1 terrace were
extrapolated from elsewhere.
Based on the investigations, Hajic and Mandel (2009)
defined the different archaeological potential for the
terraces in the Project area. The northern flood terrace,
consisting of modern or historic flood deposits, has a
negligible potential for intact archaeological deposits.
The higher terraces T3 and T4 are pre-Holocene forma­
tions that could be adequately assessed with pedestrian
survey using shovel testing. The primary potential for
intact, stratified sites lay in the middle terraces. The
geoarchaeological study recommended that the T1 and
T2 terraces could have a potential for buried deposits
and that monitoring during the trenching phase of the
Gulf Crossing pipeline construction was warranted in
these areas (Hajic and Mandel 2009:8). The results of
the Gulf Crossing monitoring program and the findings,
if any, have not been published. No deeply buried sites
are currently recorded in these terraces.
To address the potential identified in the geoar­
chaeological study, SWCA excavated a total of 11
trenches on the T1 and T2 terraces (see Figure 3; see
Table 2). Nearest the Red River, the first five trenches
(N7BFN101.T1 through T5) encountered recent al­
luvium demonstrating proximity to the active channel
and episodes of flooding. Observed within these recent
deposits were alternating lenses of sands and clays

extending to over 2.7 m in depth. Based upon the five
trenches nearest the river, 2.5 km of the route from the
river southward is regarded as having a low potential
for buried cultural resources based upon evidence of
very recent alluvial processes throughout this area.
In the center of the broad Red River terraces, four
trenches (N7BFN101.T6 through T9) encountered
saturated organic clays and muds in a paleomeander
scar with episodic backchannel ponding. These four
trenches encountered subsurface water content with
saturated clayey soils as shallow as 60 cmbs. The
archaeological potential within the low lying areas is
considered low, and the trenches revealed no cultural
material. However, immediately adjacent are flood­
plain rises that are remnants of old natural levees.
These are the high probability areas, and all previously
recorded sites in the floodplain are located on these
landforms. The Project ESA boundary marginally
skirts these landforms, as addressed in the individual
site descriptions below.
The remaining two trenches (N7BFN101.T10 and T11)
were excavated at the junction of the floodplain and
valley margin and encountered Pleistocene deposits
comprising the T3 terrace. The sediments were highly
rubified with common manganese inclusions, sup­
porting the interpretation of antiquity for the deposits
nearest the valley margin. Based on the trenching
results, this area is determined to have a low potential
for deeply buried cultural resources: any sites in the
area would be surficial or shallowly buried.

41fn51
Site 41FN51 is a multicomponent prehistoric open
campsite and historic debris scatter located in north­
eastern Fannin County on tract FA-001 at MP 161.75
(Figure 6). The site is situated on the northern T1 ter­
race of Bois d’Arc Creek, overlooking the floodplain;

the creek is 250 m southwest of the site center (Figure
7). The site sits in a fallow field covered with pasture
grasses. Surface visibility is minimal over much of the
site, though fairly extensive subsurface exposures are
along the road cut and eastern end of the site. Soils
throughout the site consist of brown sandy loam rang­
ing in depth from 40 to 100 cm, underlain by strong

brown, compact sandy clay loam with manganese
concretions. FM 79 bisects the site, and the present
investigations were conducted on the north side of
the road. Disturbances in this area include vegetation
clearing and plowing, along with road construction and
fence line construction and maintenance. As mentioned
in the background review section of this report, the
site was originally recorded by Jerry Henderson of
TxDOT in 1995.
The current extension of site 41FN51 was initially
identified when historic artifacts were recovered from
two shovel tests during pedestrian survey of MOC 280
(Table 4). As the survey continued, three more shovel
tests were positive for cultural materials, including
one test with prehistoric cultural materials. Once the
centerline survey was complete, eight off-transect de­
lineation shovel tests were excavated to refine the site
boundaries and identify additional subsurface deposits.
Only one of the delineation shovel tests yielded sub­
surface cultural material, recovering a piece of barbed
wire at 30 cmbs. Of the 23 total shovel tests, only
six were positive for cultural material. In addition to
the intensively surveyed area, reconnaissance survey
was conducted in the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain,
presently a wetland reserve area where permission to
excavate shovel tests was denied. A burned rock frag­
ment was observed on the surface in this area, likely
displaced by erosion from the upper terrace.
Based on the distribution of positive shovel tests and
the limits of the survey area, the extension of site
41FN51 covers an area roughly 195 m north-south

by 450 m east-west. All artifacts were identified in
relatively shallow (less than 40 cmbs) subsurface
contexts. The historic artifact assemblage includes
non-diagnostic clear glass and metal fragments, a brick
fragment, a wire nail, and a strand of barbed wire. The
prehistoric assemblage consists of two non-diagnostic
flakes recovered from a single shovel test, at 20 and
40 cmbs. All artifacts were recovered from depths that
would be within a plow zone, which can range from
30 to 50 cm deep. Previous site forms indicate that the
present survey area was cultivated as recently as 2008,
and Google Earth images from 1995 and 2005 clearly
show the area as a plowed field. There is evidence for
mixed deposits, as both the wire nail and barbed wire
were recovered from 30 cmbs, while one of the flakes
was recovered from 20 cmbs.
Research of the county deed records indicates that the
land which includes site 41FN51 passed through sev­
eral hands in the late nineteenth century before being
acquired by Joe R. Goss in December 1889. The land
became the extensive Goss plantation, which included
the town of Neut, Texas and was home to a number
of tenant farmers and plantation workers. Joe R. Goss
married twice and had six sons and two daughters
(Hodge 1966:183). On his death in February 1947, the
Goss plantation was deeded to his wife Beatrice. From
1947 to 1951 the land was divided amongst the Goss
heirs, and much of it subsequently was sold to others
outside of the family. The historic site materials are
most likely related to one or several of the tenant farm
families that lived on and worked the Goss plantation.

Summary
Site 41FN51 is a multiple component site consisting of
a prehistoric campsite and a twentieth century debris
scatter. The site has been investigated on three separate
occasions, resulting in a site size of approximately 195
m north-south by 450 m east-west. The site is bisected
by FM 79, and the current Project recorded a portion
of the site north of the highway. Previous investiga­
tions determined that the prehistoric component of the
site 41FN51 south of FM 79 is potentially eligible for
NRHP nomination due to the presence of a possible
hearth feature and the potential for dateable organic
materials. This part of the site is outside the Project
APE, and consequently SWCA’s investigations did
not assess the component.
The cumulative survey data indicates the prehistoric
component is almost entirely south of the roadway,

on the opposite side from the Project ESA. Of the 23
shovel tests north of the road, only one test yielded
prehistoric cultural material. Additionally, rather sub­
stantial surface exposures along an erosional scarp
revealed only a single piece of thermally fractured
rock. The historic component is likewise sparse and
disturbed, and has no evidence of structural features.
Based on the general temporal indicators, this com­
ponent is likely related to the Goss plantation, but the
complete lack of integrity undermines the interpretive
potential. The historic component within the APE is not
eligible for the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.

Based on the lack of integrity and the unsubstantial
assemblages, the research value of the site within the
Project ESA is low and no further work or avoidance is
recommended. However, the floodplain area inspected
by reconnaissance survey cannot be cleared without
subsurface investigations to confirm the presence
or absence of the site, and any significant deposits.
Therefore, the area within the WRP is recommended
for avoidance until intensive pedestrian survey with
shovel testing can be conducted. As such, the current
October 21, 2011 footprint avoids the floodplain area
via HDD.

41fn83
Site 41FN83 is a late nineteenth to early twentieth
century debris scatter located in northwestern Fannin
County on tract FA-001, near MP 159.55 (Figure 8).
The site is situated on an upland plain just south of
the wide Red River floodplain with an intermittent
drainage 500 m to the east. Vegetation consists of
mixed grasses, allowing for very poor surface visibil­
ity (5 percent). The soils consisted of 70 cm of brown
sandy loam overlying yellowish brown sandy loam to
depths past 100 cm. Impacts to the site include pipeline
construction and maintenance, which have destroyed
much of the original site area, as well as past plowing
and clearing.
Site 41FN83 was originally recorded in 2007 by Good­
win & Associates during a survey for the Gulf Crossing
pipeline (Lackowicz et al. 2009). A scatter of historic
artifacts was identified covering an area 70 m northsouth by 80 m east-west. The assemblage included 57
pieces of glass, seven metal fragments, three mortar
fragments, and two historic ceramic sherds. Artifacts
were recovered in shovel tests from 0 to 40 cmbs. An
existing pipeline was running through the site area
and had disturbed portions of the site. The site was
determined to be not eligible for listing on the NRHP.

For the Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast Project survey,
SWCA relocated the far southwestern margin of the
site in 2010 during centerline survey. The vast majority
of the site is beyond the Project survey area, and has
been substantially disturbed or destroyed by existing
pipeline right-of-ways. SWCA’s investigations identi­
fied several pieces of glass and crockery on the surface
of a two track road within a pasture, near a pipeline
corridor (Figure 9). Systematic shovel testing through
the area yielded one positive shovel test, containing
historic glass and ceramic at 20 to 60 cmbs (Table 5).
Seven pieces of glass were recovered from the shovel
test, including one manganese-bearing fragment that
predates 1917 and two thick, clear bottle pieces. The
remaining glass fragments and the single whiteware
sherd are non-diagnostic. No clearly diagnostic ar­
tifacts were noted on the surface. No features were
identified. Most of the previously recorded site area
had been destroyed by pipeline construction activities.
Research of the county deed records indicates that the
land which includes site 41FN83 passed through sev­
eral hands in the late nineteenth century before being
acquired by Joe R. Goss in December 1889. The land
became the extensive Goss plantation, which included
the town of Neut, Texas and was home to a number
of tenant farmers and plantation workers. Joe R. Goss

worked the Goss plantation, as they occupied the land
during this period.

married twice and had six sons and two daughters
(Hodge 1966:183). On his death in February 1947, the
Goss plantation was deeded to his wife Beatrice. From
1947 to 1951 the land was divided amongst the Goss
heirs, and much of it subsequently was sold to others

Site 41FN83 is a late nineteenth to early twentieth
century historic artifact scatter. The vast majority of
the site lies outside the Project ESA, and much of the
site has likely been destroyed by existing lines. It was
previously identified during the Gulf Crossing pipeline
survey and determined to be not eligible for listing
on the NRHP within the Project APE. There are no
structural remains. This component is likely related
to the Goss plantation. However, the complete lack of
integrity precludes the site from being a contributing
element to the broader context. In accordance with the
previous recommendations, the portion of site 41FN83
within the Project APE is not eligible for listing on the
NRHP, or for designation as an SAL. No further work
or avoidance strategy is recommended for the site.

41fn94
Site 41FN94 is an early twentieth century debris scatter
located in northeastern Fannin County on tract FA­
001 near MP 160.17 (Figure 10). The site is situated
on a high terrace of the Red River, south of a small
tributary of Bois d’Arc Creek (Figure 11). FM 79

runs directly south of the site. Vegetation at the site
consists of pasture grasses, with no surface visibility.
The soils are brown silty clay loam above strong brown
silty clay. Current impacts to the site include erosion,
bioturbation, fence maintenance, and possible plowing
in the past.

the 1948 establishment of the ranch, placing the site in
the Goss plantation era. Rather, the 41FN94 deposits
likely represent an in-distinct “smear” of mixed as­
semblages from the numerous residential structures
depicted on 1940s topographic maps of the area.
When the Riverby Ranch was established all obsolete
structures were apparently razed, and the landscape
smoothed over, to make the area feasible for cattle
operations.

Figure 11.

Overview of site 41FN94, facing
west.

Site 41FN94 was identified during intensive pedestrian
survey of MOC 280, when glass and metal artifacts
were found on the surface. A thorough inspection iden­
tified the extent of the surface artifact scatter. Shovel
testing was then employed to assess the subsurface
potential of the site and to further delineate the site
boundaries (Table 6). Nine of the 25 total shovel tests
were positive for a variety of historic artifacts. The site
is approximately 80 m north-south by 400 m east-west,
based on the surface scatter and positive shovel tests
within the survey area. The site spans the entire width
of the survey area, and likely continues to the north.

The site is part of the same land history as the previous­
ly discussed sites. Research of the county deed records
indicates that the land which includes site 41FN94 was
acquired by Joe R. Goss in December 1889. The land
became the extensive Goss plantation and was home
to a number of tenant farmers and plantation workers.
Joe R. Goss married twice and had six sons and two
daughters (Hodge 1966:183). On his death in February
1947, the Goss plantation was deeded to his wife Bea­
trice. From 1947 to 1951 the land was divided amongst
the Goss heirs, and the lands were blocked up under
the Riverby Ranch. The site materials are most likely
related to one or several of the tenant farm families
that worked the Goss plantation, as they occupied the
land during this period.

The artifact assemblage recovered includes extensive
surface artifacts, with a smaller subsurface collection.
The glass assemblage includes abundant brown, win­
dow, and clear glass fragments, including pieces of a
Ball jar and most of a bottle (Figure 12). One piece
of amethyst glass, which typically predates 1917, was
also recovered from a shovel test at 30 to 50 cmbs. The
ceramic assemblage includes two sherds of salt-glazed
crockery, two earthenware sherds, and three whiteware
sherds. Three square nails and a horseshoe fragment
are the metal artifacts recovered; the square nails are
too large to be horseshoe nails. Modern glass is also
scattered across the site area. Artifacts were recovered
from 0 to 50 cmbs, with no vertical concentrations to
indicate an intact surface. The jumble of artifacts within
this depth range also likely indicates disturbance within
a plow zone.
The site is within the confines of the historic-age Riv­
erby Ranch, but the artifact assemblage likely pre-dates

Summary
Site 41FN94 is a historic artifact scatter, dating to the
early to mid-twentieth century. Artifacts include both
domestic items and ranching items, reflecting a variety
of activities. Based on the lack of discrete concentra­
tions or evidence of structural features of any sort, the
overall site is interpreted as a mixed assemblage from
perhaps multiple early twentieth century homesteads
likely bulldozed upon the founding of Riverby Ranch
in 1948. This component is likely related to one of
the tenant farmers of the Goss plantation. However,

the complete lack of integrity precludes the site from
being a contributing element to the broader context.
The dispersed nature of the scatter both on the surface
and within shovel tests, as well as evidence of past
plowing, demonstrates the overall lack of integrity
for the site deposits. Based on these factors and the
lack of research potential, the portion of site 41FN94
within the Project APE is not eligible for listing on the
NRHP, or for designation as an SAL. No further work
or avoidance strategy is recommended for the site.

Maximum Site Size: 140 feet N-S by 240 feet E-W

cHss7Bfn101.001
Historic structure resource CHSS7BFN101.001 is a
mid-twentieth century corral complex associated with
the current Riverby Ranch in northeastern Fannin
County on tract FA-001 near MP 160.75 (Figure 13).
The architectural resource is situated on a relict terrace
south of the Red River floodplain north of FM 79. The
area around the architectural resource is pasture with
mixed grasses. The resource is in active use, and thus
has no significant disturbance or impacts except those
derived from use over time and modern additions that
affect historical integrity.
The site comprises a large covered showbarn/arena
and associated complex of corrals, chutes, and loading
ramps (Figure 14). The corral system was constructed
on site, mostly of welded iron pipe and a variety of
locally available materials, such as metal windmill and
oil well pump rods. Much of these materials were likely
scavenged from the local landscape, and consequently
the constituent materials are, for the most part, older
than the corral complex.
The Riverby Ranch was established in 1948, expand­
ing over time, and the corral complex was reportedly
(according to the ranch foreman at the time of the
fieldwork) constructed after the founding of the ranch,
but additional work is needed to make a clear determi­
nation on the date.
The panels and fencing appear to be made, in part,
from old windmill components, oil and gas pipe,
various types of chain, and sheet metal. The gates and
fasteners vary in size and style across the complex
system of pens, and are located on all sides. A main
chute, or series of main entrance/exit gates to all the
pens, is located down the center of the pens; a second
chute is located on the eastern side. A scale for weigh­
ing livestock is located in one of the southern pens. A
shed or storage area with a squeeze chute is located

in the northwestern-most pen (Figure 15). A loading
ramp, with an elevated end allowing for easier access
to cattle trailers, is located at the southeast end of the
large pen complex (Figure 16), along with a loading
chute. Overall, the corral complex measures 140 feet
north-south by 240 feet east-west.
A modern tin-roofed pavilion/show building is at­
tached to the northern side of the corral complex. A
gravel parking lot is adjacent to the western side of
the complex, with a “Riverby Land & Cattle Sign” at
the entrance to the lot. A driveway leads north from
FM 79 to the parking lot, continuing north beyond the
complex.
Research of the county deed records indicates that the
land which includes architectural resource CHSS7B­
FN101.001 was a part of the extensive Goss plantation,
established in 1889 by Joe R. Goss. However, based
on the estimated dates of construction, the complex is
likely associated with the later occupation, namely the
Riverby Ranch. Following Goss’s death in February
1947, the plantation was divided amongst the heirs,
and much of it subsequently was sold to others outside
of the family.
As the entrance sign by the parking lot indicates, the
sale yard and corral complex is a part of the Riverby
Ranch that likely started with the acquisition of some
of the old Goss plantation land and has been in op­
eration since 1948. The larger Riverby Ranch has
not been assessed for NRHP eligibility, and resource
CHSS7BFN101.001 may be a contributing element to
the larger historic ranch.

Summary
Site CHSS7BFN101.001 is a possible historic-age
corral complex associated with a cattle sale yard. The
resource is still in use, and the cattle sale yard as a
whole has modern improvements.

The construction of architectural resource CHSS­
7BFN101.001 may be representative of mid-twentieth
century vernacular style using available scrap metal.
The resource may also be a contributing element to
the larger Riverby Ranch complex, which has not been
assessed for NRHP/SAL eligibility, and avoidance is
recommended. If avoidance is not feasible, then archi­
tectural resource CHSS7BFN101.001 will need to be
assessed by an architectural historian and considered
within the wider context of the Riverby Ranch. This
architectural resource is avoided by the October 21,
2011, footprint via conventional bore.

41fn144
Site 41FN144 is a prehistoric Caddo artifact scatter
located at milepost (MP) 157 of the Project in Fannin
County, Texas (Figure 17). The site was an unan­
ticipated discovery identified after installation of the
pipeline. The site is located on a small rise roughly
550 m south of the Red River in plowed fields (Figure

18). County Road 2180 bisects the site, with artifacts
identified north and south of this road. The portion
of the road within this area is also known as Project
access road CAR-0470. Three existing pipelines are
located immediately to the east of the Project line.
The site is within extensively plowed fields that have
been in cultivation for half a century or more based on
a review of aerials.

directly consulting with the Caddo Tribal Historic
Preservation Office (THPO).
An SWCA archaeological monitor visited the area on
April 26 and 27, 2013, to further delineate, document,
and assess the resource. The initial Project survey
investigations conducted in 2010 and 2011 were nega­
tive for cultural resources in this area, as were two
previous surveys for the collocated pipelines to the
east. The initial discovery by tribal monitors identi­
fied approximately 24 prehistoric ceramic sherds, one
flake, 29 mussel shell fragments, and one bone frag­
ment (later determined to be faunal) scattered across
the ground surface.
Figure 18.

Overview of Project area from site
41FN144 datum, facing south.

The site lies within the Severn silt loam, rarely flooded
soil series (NRCS 2014). This soil developed from
loamy alluvium of Holocene age. The upper portion
(0 to 17.7 cmbs) is a silty loam overlaying stratified
loamy very fine sand to silty clay loam (17.7 to 152.4
cmbs). Data from the previous Project surveys as
well as the 2008 Goodwin and Associates study of
the adjacent line indicate the sands extend at least 2.5
m below surface (Lackowicz et al. 2009). While the
upper plow zone is clearly disturbed to a depth of 35
to 50 cmbs, the integrity of the zone at 50 to 60 cmbs
is undetermined and may contain intact subsurface
cultural deposits.

SItE InvEStIgatIon
On April 25, 2013, TransCanada’s Tribal Relations
Coordinator reported the discovery of a cluster of
prehistoric ceramic sherds on the graded ground sur­
face near a bore location at MP 157. At the time of
the discovery, the pipeline had already been installed.
In accordance with standard protocols, all activities
in the area ceased. The unanticipated discovery was
subsequently recorded as site 41FN144.
The area of the discovery is on lands owned by a politi­
cal subdivision of the state (NTMWD) and is therefore
subject to the ACT. SWCA obtained Permit No. 5784
in September 2010 to conduct archaeological investi­
gations on these lands. The discovery was determined
by the USACE not to be in their jurisdictional area.
Although lacking a lead federal agency, TransCanada
pursued a good faith effort to address tribal concerns,

During the field assessment on April 26 and 27, a total
of 12 shovel tests was excavated (Table 7). Four of
the 12 tests yielded archaeological materials. These
positive shovel tests were located in two areas, ap­
proximately 50 m apart. The positive shovel tests
contained two levels of artifacts: the first in the upper
0-15/20 cmbs, and a second level with cultural materi­
als recovered 50 to 60 cmbs (Figure 19). The remaining
eight shovel tests were negative.
An intensive surface survey of the recently graded
ground surface and spoil piles identified an additional
15 ceramic sherds (including one red-slipped sherd),
five flakes, one possible hammerstone, a possible
core fragment, seven pieces of bone, and six clusters
of fragmentary mussel shell. Based on the shovel
test data and distribution of surface artifacts, the site
limits are defined as 100 m north-south and 50 m eastwest, covering the width of the construction footprint.
The shovel test data and surface exposures provide
boundaries of the materials within the Project area,
but the site may extend to the east and west beyond
the Project area.
The presence of large mammal bones initiated
concern as to whether the bone was human or not.
Consequently, species identification of the bone was
conducted on all fragments. Table 8 lists the results of
the analysis. Three specimens could be classified to the
general taxonomic level. Two of these three include
the tooth enamel and one long bone fragment that can
be identified as Odocoileus spp. (deer) (Figure 20).
Additionally, one small burned fragment (Element 15)
is either a small mammal or bird long bone fragment,
retaining only a small segment of the cortex. All other
specimens are highly fragmentary, eroded, and lacking

identified, several attributes indicate these are faunal
remains. Four fragments (25 percent) were burned
(Figure 22) and six fragments (37.5 percent) exhibited
spiral fractures indicating bone processing immediately
post mortem. Consequently, the cumulative evidence
(burning, spiral fracturing, and positive identification
as deer on the only two identifiable elements at a genera
level) indicate the bone assemblage represents faunal
processing rather than human interment.

Site 41FN144 has been disturbed to some degree by
both previous and Project-related impacts. Previous
impacts include past and ongoing plowing, the con­
struction and maintenance of the county road, and
prior construction for the existing pipelines. Specific
Project impacts include grading of the upper 15 to 50
cm of topsoil throughout the construction footprint,
open trenching through a portion of the site (typically
3 m deep by 4 to 5 m wide), boring under the access
road, the installation of geotechnical fabric and timber
matting, and general vehicular transport across the site.

Summary
Site 41FN144 is a prehistoric Caddo artifact scatter
containing ceramics, debitage, a possible hammerstone, a possible core fragment, a corn cob fragment
and faunal material. Based on the findings, the current
construction stripped the upper part of the soil profile
across the site. Shovel test data indicates an increase in
artifact concentration in a zone approximately 50 to 60
cm below surface. Whether this distribution constitutes
artifacts settling out at the base of the plow zone, or
whether it is an intact cultural stratum cannot be de­
termined based on the shovel test data. Consequently,

the integrity of this zone is undetermined. The main
impacts to the site include plowing, the construction
of the current pipeline and three previous collocated
pipelines, an existing county road, and ranch roads,
which also serve as the Project access road. TransCanada notified and consulted with the Caddo THPO
to develop a plan allowing completion of work near the
site and for the removal of equipment. These measures
included covering the area in geotechnical fabric and
subsequently covering the fabric with timber matting.
The eligibility of the site for listing in the NRHP and
designation as a SAL is undetermined.

Summary and rEcommEndatIonS
On behalf of Keystone, exp retained SWCA to conduct
a cultural resources inventory including intensive pe­
destrian survey and backhoe trenching of 5.1 miles of
300-foot wide easement that cross NTMWD-owned
lands along the southern terraces of the Red River in
Fannin and Lamar Counties, Texas. The 5.1 miles fall
within the larger Keystone Pipeline Gulf Coast Project
(Project) multi-state pipeline extending from Cushing,
Oklahoma, to Nederland, Texas.
Regulated by the USACE Section 404 permit, the
Project is subject to review under Section 106 of the
NHPA of 1966, as amended (16 United States Code
470). SWCA’s cultural resources investigations, there­
fore, were designed to identify, inventory, and evaluate
cultural resources in the 300-foot-wide ESA to comply
with the NHPA and its implementing regulations (36
CFR Part 800). Additionally, as NTMWD is a political
subdivision of the state and subject to compliance with
the ACT, Permit No. 5784 was obtained in Septem­
ber 2010 for cultural resources investigations within
the Project ESA on lands acquired by the NTMWD.
Therefore, cultural resources were evaluated for their
potential to be designated as SALs in addition to eli­
gibility for listing on the NRHP.

investiGAtions summAry
This addendum details the findings of a cultural re­
sources inventory within the ACT-permitted portion of
the Project ESA in Texas. SWCA performed the cul­
tural resources investigations in October 26–29, 2010,
and April 26-27, 2013. The investigations included
an intensive pedestrian survey consisting of ground
surface inspection and systematic shovel testing. In
addition, backhoe trenching was performed in select
areas with the potential for deeply buried deposits.
The cultural resources investigations assessed a total
of 5.1 miles of mainline centerline and an additional
0.625 mile of access roads. The investigations reflect
the Project construction footprint as of October 21,
2011, which falls within the final Project construction
footprint of February25, 2013.

culturAl resources summAry
In total, seven cultural resources were identified within
the ACT-permitted Project APE including two newly
recorded archaeological sites (41FN94 and 41FN144),
two previously recorded archaeological sites (41FN51

47

and 41FN83), one newly recorded historic-age archi­
tectural resource (CHSS7BFN101.001), and two newly
recorded prehistoric isolated finds (CIF6BFN11.001
and CIF6BFN11.002). Of the four archaeological
sites, two are historic (41FN83 and 41FN94), one
is multicomponent (41FN51), and one is prehistoric
(41FN144).
Of the seven documented cultural resources, three
(41FN51 prehistoric component, CHSS7BFN101.001,
and 41FN144) have an undetermined NRHP and SAL
eligibility status, while two (41FN83 and 41FN94)
are not eligible for NRHP listing or for designation as
SALs within the Project APE. Isolated finds are not
NRHP or SAL eligible.
Avoidance of those cultural resources with an unde­
termined NRHP and SAL eligibility status was imple­
mented during the construction phase of the Project.
Therefore, the Project will not affect significant cultural
resources and no further work is recommended.
Additionally, two previously recorded sites (41FN40
and 41FN82) mapped within the ACT-permitted
Project ESA were not relocated within the mainline
Project ESA during the current investigations. Simi­
larly, another two previously recorded sites (41FN41
and 41FN88) mapped immediately adjacent to the
ACT-permitted Project ESA were not relocated within
Project access road CAR-475 during the previous 2008
investigations performed prior to acquirement of the
lands by NTMWD. Therefore, it was determined that
none of these four sites extends into the Project ESA.
Any artifacts collected from the sites documented
within the ACT-permitted Project ESA were to be
curated at TARL at the University of Texas in compli­
ance with the stipulations of ACT Permit No. 5784.
However, no artifacts were collected during this survey
therefore, no artifacts were curated.
