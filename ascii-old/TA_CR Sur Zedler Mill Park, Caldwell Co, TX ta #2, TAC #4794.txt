Abstract
In late January and early February 2008, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology performed a cultural
resources survey encompassing 9.389 acres potentially to be developed as a park with a bath
pavilion in what is now known as the Zedler Mill Tract on the south edge of Luling, Texas. The
project area is owned by the City of Luling, and the archaeological investigation was funded by
the City of Luling.
Preliminary fieldwork consisted of a search of the Caldwell County archaeological site forms on
file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), The University of Texas at Austin,
as well as a review of published reports. The Zedler Mill was previously documented as an
historical archaeological site (41CW28) in 1982 by Nancy Kenmotsu.
For this project, the minimum survey standards as prescribed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists and the Texas Historical Commission were followed. A 100-percent surface
survey was conducted, ten backhoe trenches were excavated, and ten shovel tests were dug
across the project area. No intact subsurface cultural deposits were encountered across the entire
9.389-acre tract, and no artifacts were collected. As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology
recommended that the City of Luling be allowed to develop the tract as planned. However,
Tierras Antiguas recommended that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were
encountered during development, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds were examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.

Acknowledgments
Those individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to the successful
planning, organization, and completion of this project are:
Mr. Chris Powell, City Planning, City of Luling, who provided first hand knowledge of where
buried sewer, water, gas, and utility lines were located. Mr. Juan Camacho of the City of Luling,
who skillfully operated the backhoe. Mr. Trey Bailey, City Planning, City of Luling who
provided the survey maps used in the investigations and in this report. Mayor Mike Hendricks
who took the time to come by and visit for awhile and express an interest in the project. Mr.
Mark Denton, Texas Historical Commission who made this project go smoothly by taking a day
to visit the park and advise Mr. Engelke on the requirements of an archaeological survey.
An extra special thank you is in order for Mr. Randy Engelke, Parks Director, City of Luling,
Texas. Randy took a special interest in the archaeology in the park, and was there from the
beginning to the end. His knowledge of the history of the Zedler Mill operation and the Zedler
family is remarkable. He contributed immensely to this report by providing first hand
information about the changes and disturbances that had occurred to the area over the years, and
was able to point out locations where structures and features were once stood, such as the privy
and garden area. He identified the standing structures and informed me of how they were used.
Finally, he provided copies of historical documents and reports on file with the City of Luling
and the Zedler Mill Foundation.

Introduction
In January 2008, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology was contracted by the City of Luling to conduct
a cultural resources
survey of 9.389
acres
of
land
owned by the City
of Luling, and
potentially to be
developed
into
parkland.
The
project is located
on the south edge
of Luling, in southcentral
Caldwell
County,
Texas
(Figure 1), and the
archaeological
survey was funded
by the City of
Luling.
Texas
Antiquities Permit
#4794 was granted
by
the
Texas
Historical
Commission, and
approval to proceed
with
the
archaeological
investigations was
then given by the
City of Luling on
30 January 2008.
The survey was
conducted
on
January 31st and
February 1st, 2008.

Zedler Mill
Setting
The Zedler Mill tract is located on the east bank of the San Marcos River, on the southern
periphery of the City of Luling in southern Caldwell County (Figure 1). A deeply incised creek
coursing through the center of the tract and conjoining with the river below the dam is named
Mill Creek. The tract has been subjected to frequent flooding along the river, and in 2000 the
water rose to a level that inundated the lower few feet of the mill (Randy Engelke, personal
communication, January 31st, 2008).
The soils along the river terraces in this area are classified as within the Lewisville (LeC2) series.
Comprised of silty clay on 3-5% eroded slopes, a typical profile consists of dark brown
calcareous silty clay from the surface to 40 cm, brown calcareous silty clay with calcium
carbonate concretions from 40-90 cm, and below that, brown silty clay with calcium carbonate
soft masses and concretions. These have formed from the accumulation of alluvial (stream)
deposited sediments alongside drainages, resulting in gently sloping old terraces (Lowther and
Wercham 1978). However, in terms of age, Lewisville terraces can be relatively young, and
certainly within the Holocene , thus having the potential to retain stratified evidence of human
occupation from about 12,000 years ago through the present. Along the floodplain are Bosque
(Bp) soils, frequently flooded at least once a year. A subtropical, humid climate in Caldwell
County is created by an average annual rainfall of 35 inches, and average temperatures of 960F in
July and 380F in January (Tyler 1996).
Fritz Zedler
Born in 1840, Fritz Zedler emigrated from Prussia to Indianola with his parents and eight
brothers and sisters when he was twelve years old. The family settled in Yorktown. By the time
he was 18, Fritz was employed carrying mail between Indianola and Gonzales. Following that he
worked as a cowhand driving cattle from Yorktown to New Orleans. Gaining more experience,
he then freighted lake ice and Irish potatoes in covered wagons from Indianola to San Antonio.
When the Civil War broke out, he joined the Confederate Army and played in a regimental band.
In 1862, he married Louise Fechner, a citizen of Yorktown. They both traveled via a mule team
hook-up to Mexico, and lived in Matamoras for awhile, having two sons born there, the first
dying of smallpox.
They then returned to Texas where after the Civil War was over, Fritz worked as a wheelwright
making wagon spokes from trees along the Guadalupe River. In 1872, he and his family (now
one son and two daughters) moved to Gonzales County, in the community of Sandies where Fritz
built a grist mill, a sawmill, and a cotton gin. Here, their family grew to nine in number with the
addition of three more sons and another daughter. Although the businesses apparently prospered,
in 1880 they moved again, this time along the San Marcos River and what became known as
Andrews Switch. Here he built another mill and gin complex (Walkerâs Mill), and the couple had
another son.In 1884, Fritz moved closer to Luling to take over operation of what became known
as Zedlerâs Mill (Pfeiffer 2006; Westbrook 1974; Zedler n.d).

History (see also, Appendix A)
The Zedler Mill operation began in 1874, the same year that the town of Luling was founded. It
provided much-needed milled grain to an area that was then mostly an agrarian society, except
for Luling which quickly grew to about 1,000 people. Leonidas Hardeman, James Meriweather,
and John Meriweather came to the area from Tennessee and in 1874, began constructing a dam
across the San Marcos River. At first they ran a grist mill operation for cornmeal, and later built
a gin to process cotton, an emerging cash crop. Ginned cotton was then shipped by rail on the
Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railroad.
By 1883, the three men contracted to have a water wheel installed that was able to force water
from the river into the city of Luling. In 1884, the three men sold the grist mill, the cotton gin,
and the dam to Fritz Zedler, Bob Ennis, John Orchard, and J. K. Walker. The latter three were
apparent investors, but Fritz Zedler was the man with the know-how to make the operation a
success, and he ran the business. The operation then began commonly referred to as Zedlerâs
Mill. Shortly thereafter, a sawmill operation was put in place. Once again, Fritz Zedler was the
man who knew how to run a sawmill.
By 1888, Fritz bought out the shares owned by Ennis, Orchard, and Walker and made his oldest
son Berthold a partner in the operation. As it so happened, 1888 proved to be a boom year for
cotton production and a grand appreciation dinner was held for the gin customers in the gin yard.
Unfortunately, a fire broke out and the entire three-story gin structure burned to the ground on
October 15th.
Undaunted, the Zedler family pitched in and with some outside financial support, a newly built
gin was operating in an astounding seven weeksâ² time. Over the ensuing years, the sons of Fritz
and Louise assumed ownership and operational control of the mill. Although Zedlerâs Mill had
provided water to the city of Luling many years before, in 1894 an electric plant was built onsite
to provide electricity to Luling as well. The Zedlers operated the mill business through the late
1950s, still producing chicken feed and cornmeal (Pfeiffer 2006; Westbrook 1974; Zedler n.d).
Archaeological Investigations
Methods
Pre-Field Investigations
A records search with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory was conducted to determine
if any sites had been previously documented either within the 9.389-acre project area, or within
close proximity. Although there are numerous prehistoric sites along the San Marcos River and
its many tributaries, none had been documented within the project area. However, Nancy
Kenmotsu had documented the Zedler Mill historical complex as archaeological site 41CW28 in
1982 (Kenmotsu 1982).

Various unpublished and published reports regarding mill and gin operations of the time period
were reviewed, along with aerial photographs and topographic maps of the project area, soils and
geological data reports, and historical publications about the City of Luling and Caldwell
County. On Saturday, January 12th, a pre-proposal visit was conducted on-site with Mr. Randy
Engleke in order to better understand the project in general, as well as the planned development
across the entire project area. This visit was instrumental in preparing an appropriate scope of
work for the archaeological investigations.
Field Investigations
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) Archaeology Survey Standards, a scope
of work approved in conjunction with Texas Antiquities Permit #4731 was executed. This
involved a systematic, 100% pedestrian survey across the entire the project area, followed by the
excavation of ten backhoe trenches and ten shovel tests. The surface of the survey area was
examined in a systematic pattern in 15-m intervals, with particular attention paid to eroded and
exposed areas void of vegetation, road surfaces, and ephemeral cutbanks. The placement of
backhoe trenches focused on those areas expected to be deeply impacted by the planned
installation of water and sewer lines, with remaining trenches located in areas that may be
impacted by as yet unplanned, but envisioned development. The placement of shovel tests was
based upon the same logic, but with a secondary focus upon areas with a high probability of
buried cultural deposits. Figure 44 shows the locations of backhoe trenches and shovel tests.
The backhoe trenches were dug approximately 4 m in length, approximately in 30-cm levels, and
to depths encountering either sterile clay or sandy soils. The Principal Investigator observed the
trenching and backdirt. Shovel tests were dug in 20-cm levels, and all sediments were screened
through Â¼" wire mesh. All shovel tests were 30 x 30-cm in circumference, and were excavated to
sterile clay, gravels, or bedrock.
Generally, a âNo Collection Policyâ was followed for this project, and any redundant artifacts
recovered from shovel tests or backhoe trenches, after being described, were placed in the upper
10 cm of the backfilled shovel test or backhoe unit. Any unique-item artifacts observed on the
surface were fully documented, precisely mapped, and left in place. Our pre-approved scope of
work allowed that if any artifacts were observed that could be considered as significant to any
period of the cultural history of Texas that is as yet either unknown or is poorly understood, then
those artifacts would be collected. Examples would be from the Paleoindian and Early Archaic
periods. The Principal Investigator was to make those determinations on a case-by-case basis.
The results of shovel testing and backhoe trenching were fully documented, and their locations
were precisely mapped. This report includes those locations, and accompanying tables providing
artifact types (if any), and depths. Finally, an updated Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) form was filed.

Survey Results
Standing Structures and Mill Creek
Standing structures at the time of this 2008 archaeological study included the large gin/mill
complex, the dam across the San Marcos River, the stables, a tin shed that apparently housed an
employee, an apparent workshop, a mill office and headquarters (Figures 2-11), and a two-story
house on the north side of Mill Creek. According to Mr. Engleke, the two-story house at one
time was occupied by the Zedler family, and in more recent years was utilized as a restaurant.
The historic house is now owned by the City of Luling, is occupied, and rented out by the City.

Surface Inspection
A systematic surface examination revealed five areas where historic surface artifacts or modern
trash were the most prevalent: 1) in the bottom and cutbanks of Mill Creek 2) around the gin and
mill 3) around the burned house 4) around the stables 5) around the workshop. No prehistoric
artifacts were observed across the entire project area.
Mill Creek
The Principal Investigator walked the Mill Creek bottom from its entrance into the project area
on the northern portion through to its confluence with the San Marcos River on the southern
portion. A careful examination of the exposed cutbanks on both sides of the creek revealed
sandstone bedrock in some areas, evidence of flooding episodes or stream shifting in the form of
size-sorted gravel deposits, and imbedded modern trash or construction debris (Figures 12-19). It
is apparent that this channel is deeply incised to a depth of at least six meters, and has been
subjected to extreme, rapid runoff in modern times. No significant historic nor prehistoric
artifacts were observed. Instead, the following items were noted:
1) Concrete slabs, Portland coarse mix with river gravels
2) Rounded chert cobbles and gravels
3) Red brick fragments, tile and sewer pipe sections, no makerâs mark
4) Abundant modern trash (styrofoam, plastic bottles, etc.)
5) Galvanized sheet metal pieces
6) Rubber football
7) Styrofoam fishing float
9) Red brick fragment with âGROE...â and â...âR...â in raised letters
8) Coca Cola bottle glass sherds, light green in color
9) Strap iron pieces, rusted
10) Clear glass dinnerware sherd (Figure 18)
11) Whole bottle with plastic screw top (Figure 19)

In addition, the cutbanks revealed evidence of
erosional and depositional episodes, while its
confluence with the San Marcos River has
been significantly altered (Figures 20-22)

Gin and Mill Structure Area
In addition to numerous pieces of modern trash such as styrofoam, PVC pipe pieces, plastic
bottle twist-on caps, aluminum pull-tabs, Crown bottle caps, clear plastic, clear plastic
corrugated roofing sections, sheetrock fragments, glass, and cigarette butts, the following items
were observed around the gin/mill structure (see Figure 23 for examples):
1) Machined bolt
2) Brown glazed electrical insulator fragment
3) Undecorated whiteware sherds (6 each); 1 rim sherd
4) 1 milk glass sherd
5) 100+ light green window glass sherds
6) 25+ clear bottle glass sherds (no hue)
7) Galvanized corrugated roofing pieces
8) Clear glass screw-top to 1-quart jug
9) Porcelain insulator fragments
10) Chicken leg bone; broken & cracked; no cut or saw marks; unburned; little weathering

On the east side of the gin/mill structure were
bricks on the surface from the collapsed
chimney. Although they appeared to represent
a layered floor or patio, Mr. Engleke
confirmed that they were from the collapsed
chimney, and he and his employees stacked
them in this area, and later moved the
majority of them and stacked them north of
the workshop (Figures 45 and 47). The bricks
imbedded into the surface on the east side of
the gin/mill structure are what are left over.
Most of these remaining bricks are yellow
and red, with a few bearing a makerâs mark of
âSTAR FIRE BRICKâ. Star Fire Bricks
were manufactured by Mr. Saengerâs Star
Clay Products in Elmendorf, in western
Bexar County in the early 1900s (Long
2008; Steinbomer 1982).

Burned House Area
According to Mr. Engelke, the house burned in the recent past (Figures 24-29). As such, there
were numerous pieces of melted glass and construction debris within a few feet of the outline of
the structure. Mr. Engelke pointed out where a bathroom had been added to the structure on the
west side of the house, and that is where most of the following items were observed on the
surface (Figure 30):
1) Vitrified and asbestos sewer pipe
2) Green bottle glass
3) Porcelain electrical light socket
4) Asbestos shingles
5) Â¾-inch lead water line pipe
6) Unidentified sheet metal fragments
7) Yellow brick fragments w/Portland based mortar
8) 4-legged cast-iron bathtub
9) Brass plumbing pipes and faucets
10) Porcelain toilet sherds
11) 2-inch and 4-inch iron sewer pipe and fittings
12) Clear glass jar sherds, no hue, screw-top lid (post-1930)

The only item with a makerâs mark
observed on the surface was a bottle glass
sherd with â...E SMIRNOFF...5 QUARTâ
in raised molded lettering (Figure 30). The
glass is clear with an amythyst hue,
suggesting a date of manufacture between
1880 and 1915 (Munsey 1970).

Mill Employeeâs Shack Area
This small structure was apparently a home to a mill/gin employee (Figures 31 and 32). Inside
were a gas range and oven, rusted bedsprings, clear glass Mason jars, a 5-gallon kerosene can,
and assorted modern trash (Figure 32). On the exterior, the Principal Investigator observed the
following:
1) Stoneware pot lid with Bristol glaze on both
the interior and exterior (ca. 1920-1950)
2) Metal screw-on cap for Mason jar lid (Figure
33)
3) Galvanized stovepipe piece
4) 4 Cast iron sinks and a sink pedestal

Stables Area
The horse stables complex is located on the upper-most, western portion of the site (Figure 34) .
The few materials on the surface (Figure 35) consisted of:
1) 2 whiteware body sherds
2) Green, brown, and clear glass (w/no hue) bottle glass sherds
3) Metal squeeze tube for ointment (5-inch)
4) Metal screw cap w/plastic seal inset
5) Sandstone slab, 8Â½ x 5Â½ x 1Â½ inches

Storage Barn North of Stables Area
A storage barn with sliding doors and
concrete watering troughs is located on the
highest, extreme western portion of the
property, north of the stables Figures 36
and 37). Unlike the stables area, dense
grasses are present impeding surface
visibility to <20%. Nevertheless, the
following artifacts were observed (Figure
38):
1) Yellow brick w/yellowish, pasty mortar;
appears to be machine-made; no makerâs
mark
2) Red brick fragment; crumbly and poorly
made

3) Hewn limestone slab
4) Rusted washtub
5) 3 yellow bricks, same as above, but w/no
mortar; 4Â¼ x 8Â½ x 2Â¼ inches

Workshop Area
Just downslope and to the east of the
stables and storage barn is an apparent
workshop, with a hand-crank fuel pump,
wooden shelving, and benches inside
(Figures 39 and 40). A scant few artifacts
and other items were observed around the
workshop, but a laid brick âpatioâ and a
brick support lie on its north side (Figures
41 and 42). The items (Figure 43)
observed included:
1) 6 sections of 2-inch iron pipe, 7-8 feet
long
2) Porcelain electric insulator sherd

3) Clear glass bottle sherds; no hue
4) Dipstick

The brick patio abutted the north edge of the workshop, was precisely and evenly laid without
mortar, and the top of the bricks were now even with the surface. Many of the yellow and
reddish orange bricks were unmarked,
but all appeared to be machine-made
and well-fired. A few exhibited a
makerâs mark identified as âEVEN &
HOWARD, ST. LOUISâ, âSTAR
FIREâ, and âCOLEMANâ.
As with those observed from the
collapsed chimney east of the main
mill/gin structure, these âSTAR FIREDâ
bricks were manufactured in the early
1900s by Star Clay Products in
Elmendorf, in western Bexar County in
the early 1900s (Long 2008; Steinbomer
1982). Those with the âEVEN &
HOWARDâ mark were manufactured
from the 1870s through the 1930s by the
Evens & Howard Fire Brick Company
in St. Louis, Missouri. According to
Steinbomer (1982) these bricks were
commonly imported until the brick
making industry in Texas was refined
and productive. This would have been in
the early 1900s. The third series of
marked brick, those with âCOLEMANâ,
are from the Coleman Brick Company
in Athens, Henderson County, Texas.
Mr. Coleman purchased the company
outright in 1899, and the company
continued to operate through 1968
(Henderson County 2008).
An apparent support foundation 24 feet east of the workshop consisted of laid bricks with no
mortar embedded within the surface. The nearly square foundation fixture measured 12Â¾ x 13Â¼
inches. All of the bricks were unmarked, but were well made and highly fired.

Ten backhoe trenches and ten shovel tests were excavated across the project area (Figure 44).

Backhoe Trenches (BHTs)
BHT 1
BHT 1 was placed in the northwestern portion of the project area, on the southern periphery of
Mill Creek on a line where a sewer line is projected to cross the creek from an existing main on
the north side, and then elbow to the east toward the proposed bath house development (Figure
45). BHT 1 was excavated to 1.5 m below the surface, into very fine sandy loam (Table 1), and
well below the expected impact during construction of the proposed sewer line. The only cultural
items found were what appear to be round discs from a farm implement buried between 10-40
cm below the surface (Figure 46).

BHT 2
BHT 2 was placed along the northern
edge of a concrete wall in front of the
burned-out house (Figure 47). This
location was selected because it is on a
line with the proposed sewer trench
between the BHT 1 area and the planned
bath house facility. BHT 2 was
excavated to a depth of 1.25 m below the
surface, well below the expected impact
caused by the construction of the planned
sewer line. No cultural material was
observed either within the backdirt or
within the trench walls. According to Mr.
Engelke, it is believed that the Zedler
family maintained a garden in this area.
The soils encountered in BHT2 are
described in Table 2.

BHT 3
Proposed development along the San Marcos River includes the construction of an amphitheater
that overlooks the river south of the now burned house once stood, and above the current
portage ramp. The potential for the upper terrace along the northern edge of the San Marcos
River in this area to yield evidence of prehistoric occupation prompted the locations of BHTs 3
and 4. BHT 3 was positioned perpendicular to the river, so that it would cut deeply into the
slope, revealing not only the uppermost portion of the terrace and any cultural material, but also
any stratified sediment deposits below the
upper terrace (Figure 48). The only cultural
material encountered was a Â¾-inch rusted
and dormant waterline extruding from a
square (ca. 12-inch x 12-inch x 5-inch)
layer of bricks ca. 15 cm below the surface.
This may have been a support structure for
the pipe. The pipe extended west toward
the river, and âteedâ at another Â¾-inch line
running parallel to the river on the slope,
ca. 80 cm below the upper terrace modern
surface. Upon close examination and photo
documentation, the Principal Investigator
advised the backhoe operator to proceed.
No other cultural material was observed in
BHT 3. The soils encountered in BHT3 are
described in Table 3.

The logic for positioning BHT 4 within the
upper terrace where an amphitheater may
be constructed was the same as for BHT 3.
Once again, BHT 4 was positioned
perpendicular to the river, so that it would
cut deeply into the slope, revealing not
only the uppermost portion of the terrace
and any cultural material, but also any
stratified sediment deposits below the
upper terrace (Figures 49-51). No cultural
material was observed in BHT 4. The soils

Construction of the proposed bath house east
and northeast of the burned-out house may
include the demolition of a concrete retaining
wall and impact to the subsurface of
approximately 1.5 m. A shovel test (ST 3)
placed in the area of the most impact
indicated that the area had been densely filled
in with angular limestone cobbles.
Nevertheless, in order to confirm that it was
in fact filled-in debris in the area, Backhoe
Trench 5 was placed inside the area (Figure
52).
It was discovered that the fill in this area was
<20 cm deep, conforming to the natural
surface level outside the west edge of the concrete retainer. The only cultural material
encountered was a Â¾-inch dormant water pipe 10 cm below the surface. The soils encountered in
BHT 5 are described in Table 5.

is planned to the restroom facilities (see
Figure 47). The only cultural item found
was a cedar fence post in the west wall of
the trench near its southern end (Figure
53). The post was 7-9 cm in diameter and
extended from 8-70 cm below the surface.

BHT 7
BHT 7 was one of four trenches excavated in the open field area on the northeastern portion of
the project area (Figure 54). Evidence of intrusive fill overburden was found in all four (Figure
55). This may be a result of a previously planned private development of the area that included
the construction of a concrete pad for a motel. The planned development failed (personal
communication, Mr. Randy Engelke and Mr.Chris Powell, 31 January 2008). As of February
2008, the City of Luling had no plans in place for developing this area. BHT 7 was located in the
northwestern portion of the open field. No artifacts were observed. Soil descriptions are in Table
7.

BHT 8
BHT 8 was placed in the northeastern-most portion of the project area (Figure 56). As with BHT
7, it appears that the upper sediments consist of intrusive fill material, in this case to a depth of
75 cm below the surface. The upper 5 cm consisted of a dark gray loam root zone. From 5-75
cm, clearly stratified layers of gray and dark gray apparent fill material graded from dark gray
loam with rounded gravels (0-45 cm), to gray clay loam with larger rounded gravels (45-75 cm).
Below that, from 75-95 cm were apparently parent soils consisting of grayish brown silty loam,
underlain by red silty clay to a depth of 120 cm and the bottom of the trench (Figure 57).
The base of a clear glass
bottle base was found in the
backdirt
removed
from
between 0-30 cm below the
surface (Figure 58). Its
modern machine mold seam
suggests
a
date
of
manufacture after 1903,
while the clarity of the glass,
with no hue, suggests a date
of manufacture after 1930. It
has raised molded lettering
and a makerâs mark. The âJâ
inside a keystone figure
indicates that it was made by
the Knox Glass Bottle
Company
of
Jackson,
Mississippi between 1922

and 1953, perhaps even later. The â54" merely indicates the number for the set of molds from
which it was made, and the âBâ following the dash indicates it was made to hold beverages
(Lockhart 2004; Munsey 1970; Toulouse 1971).

BHT 9
BHT 9 was also placed in the open grassy field in the northeastern portion of the project area.
During the excavation it soon became apparent that a substantial amount of fill material had been
spread across this area. Below a 30-cm root and topsoil zone, distinctly stratified layers of red
and yellow clay loam with rounded river gravels were encountered to a depth of 105 cm.
Between 105-175 cm, apparently in situ brown fine sand was encountered before excavations
were terminated. According to Mr. Randy Engelke (personal communication, January 31, 2008),
discovering these underlying fine sands is not uncommon in the Luling area.
The only cultural item found in this trench was a clear glass bottle base between 45-67 cm. It has
a â6" in raised molded lettering, but no other markings. Its modern mold seam suggests a date of
manufacture after 1903, but its clarity, with no hue, suggests it was made after 1930 (Munsey
1970; Toulouse 1971).
BHT 10
This is the last of four backhoe trenches placed in the upper, northeastern portion of the project
area. Intrusive fill material was encountered to a depth of 95 cm. The upper 0-38 cm consisted of
dark brown topsoil. From 38-95 cm were clearly stratified layers of yellow, red, and gray loamy
clay with chunks of road pavement and strips of red flagging tape. From 95-100 cm, the apparent
underlying in situ red silty clay was encountered before excavation of the trench was terminated
at 120 cm (Figure 59). No cultural material was observed.

Shovel Tests (STs)
A total of 10 shovel tests were dug across the project area as a complemental investigation of
subsurface deposits revealed by backhoe trenching. Selected locations for shovel tests were
decided based upon either: 1) isolated locations that potentially contained archaeological
deposits but the excavation of a backhoe trench was either not practical, or deemed to possibly
disturb such deposits beyond what a shovel test would 2) areas that could potentially contain
archaeological deposits, but based upon soils data sheets, were likely shallow.
ST 1
ST 1 was located in the San Marcos River
floodplain on the eastern extension of
where a proposed amphitheater may be
located (Figure 60). It was also 8 m east of
an existing kayak/canoe exit ramp, and 3 m
west of a 2.5-m cutbank along the river. No
cultural material was found. Soils from 040 cm were loam with a Â½-inch root and
snail fragments, from 40-60 cm was fine
sand, and from 60-80 cm was cloddy
yellowish brown clayey loam with snail
fragments.

ST2
ST 2 was placed on an upper terrace
remnant narrowed by the construction of
the main mill and gin complex to the south
(Figure 61). Specifically, it was situated
11 m north of the gin/mill chimney
remains on the east side of the complex,
and 5 m west of the steep slope toward the
lower end of Mill Creek. Notably, an iron
pin with hammered scars in the top was
observed even with the surface 1.5 m east
of ST2 (Figure 62).
This was the only shovel test that yielded
any evidence of historic and prehistoric
occupations within the project area. Road
fill in the form of reddish brown, grayish
brown, and yellowish brown coarse sand
with a dense matrix of rounded gravels
was encountered between the surface and
53 cm. The apparently in situ soils
consisting of grayish brown clay loam
with rotted roots, small pebbles, and
fragmented snail shells were encountered
between 53-80 cm.
The artifacts found in this shovel test were
concentrated on what appears to be the
historic occupation surface, 53 cm below
the modern fill. They include square nails,
charcoal chunks, and melted aqua-colored
glass (Figure 63). In addition, presumably
prehistoric artifacts discovered included a
tan bifacial reduction secondary flake that
had been burned, and two gray heat
spalls, all made from chert. No artifacts
were found below the 53-55-cm level.

ST 3
ST 3 was placed 3.4 m from the north concrete retaining wall and 2.5 m from the east retaining
wall in the front yard of the burned-out house(Figure 64). This is the area where restroom
facilities are proposed for development of the park. It is an elevated area, over 1.5 m above the
natural surface to the north, where BHT 2
was excavated. Upon digging ST 3 it soon
became apparent that the concrete retaining
wall surrounding the front yard of the
burned-out house enclosed rubble and fill
dirt used to bring the front yard to a level
grade. The upper 70 cm of fill consisted of
coarse sand and rounded gravels, with an
increase in density of gravels with depth.
The shovel test was terminated 70 cm
below the surface in a dense layer of river
gravels and limestone slab rubble 95% by
volume. The only cultural item discovered
was a modern clay flower pot sherd in the
upper 20 cm.

ST 4
ST 4 was placed in the uppermost elevated
portion of the tract above the river, where
seemingly, evidence of prehistoric
occupations above flood levels were likely
to exist. Specifically, it was in a grassy,
gently sloping area upslope from the
workshop between it and the stables, 10 m
north of the tin shed that was a home for
the mill employee, and 4 m northeast of a
concrete horse watering trough (Figure
65). No cultural material was found in ST
4. Soils and sediments encountered
include: 0-20 cm, brown silty clay with
chert and limestone gravels 10% by
volume; 20-60 cm, pale brown silty clay
with limestone gravels 20% by volume, and calcium carbonate masses 20% by volume; 60-80
cm, yellowish brown silty clay.

ST 5
ST 5 was placed on what appears to be a
lower terrace along Mill Creek, 10 m
south of the creek cutbank, and north of
the gin/mill building (Figure 66). The
cutbank here is 6 m above the creek
bottom. Black clay gumbo was
encountered from 0-60 cm below the
surface, with no evidence of cultural
material.

ST 6
ST 6 was placed on the northwest
periphery of Mill Creek, approximately 5
m west of the creekâs cutbank, 10 m south
of a paved road intersection of South
Laurel Street and an unnamed road that
leads to the river bridge underpass, and 5
m south of a utility pole (Figure 67).
Although the potential for intact
archaeological deposits could be expected
along Mill Creek near its confluence with
the San Marcos River, none were
encountered. Instead, results of shovel
testing revealed paper and aluminum cans
in the upper 20 cm, aluminum pull tabs
and asphalt from 20-40 cm, coarse sand
and gravel fill material between 40-60
cm, and a dense calcified gravel bed from
60-63 cm when excavations were
terminated.

ST 7
ST 7 was situated 12 m southeast of a fire
hydrant fronting South Laurel Street, in an
open area 5 m northwest of Mill Creek, and
10 m east of the two-lane gravel road and
bridge leading into the gin/mill complex
area (Figure 68).
Introduced sediments and rock encountered
in the upper 60 cm were later confirmed
when Mr. Engelke attested that this area
east of the road had been built-up with fill
from elsewhere. At 60 cm below the
modern surface, yellowish brown sterile
clay represented an abrupt lower boundary,
and excavations were terminated at 63 cm.
No cultural material was found throughout.

ST 8
Moving to the west, but still along the
meanders of Mill Creek, ST 8 was placed
10 m north of its steep cutbank, 20 m south
of South Laurel Street, and 23 m west of the
driveway over the bridge to the mill (Figure
69). No cultural material was encountered
in this shovel test, only black clay with a
few roots from the surface to 60 cm.

ST 9
ST 9 was situated 7 m north of the steep
Mill Creek cutbank, and 17 m south of
South Laurel Street (Figure 70). A large
push pile 8 m to the west near the intended
sewer line extension from South Laurel
toward our BHT 1 location indicated that at
least some degree of disturbance had
occurred in that area. No cultural material
was encountered, but natural sediments and
soils included the following:1) 0-20 cm,
dark brown clay with sand and snail shell
fragments, 2) 20-60 cm, black clay.

ST 10
ST 10 was excavated in an open grassy filed
amidst scattered mature pecan trees 33 m
west of the large two-story frame house,
and 19 m north of South Laurel Street
(Figure 71). The upper 10 cm consisted of
brown sand topsoil with a few small chert
pebble inclusions, followed by dark brown
silty clay to 80 cm. The only cultural item
was a modern brown beer glass bottle sherd
in the upper 10 cm.

Conclusions and Recommendations
During this project a thorough examination of the surface and the cutbanks along Mill Creek was
made, and ten backhoe trenches and ten shovel tests were excavated. No evidence of intact
cultural material was found. Therefore, we recommend that the City of Luling be allowed to
proceed with development of the project area as currently designed without further
archaeological work. However, if any apparently intact cultural resources beyond what has been
ascertained from this current archaeological investigation are encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated by
Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical
Commission.

Appendix A. Zedler Mill Land and Structures
Background
Upon review of the Draft of this report, Mr. Mark Denton of the Texas Historical Commission
commented that although much of the siteâs history from when the gin and mill were
constructed, from ca. 1875 to the present, has been documented in various reports, very little
information is available regarding the use of the site before then. In addition, this report would be
more informational if it included some very general observations of the existing structures.
Therefore this appendix was added.
Land Ownership and Use Prior to Mill Construction
A concise summary of what became known as Zedlerâs Mill has been written by Maria Watson
Pfeiffer for the City of Luling and Fisher-Heck Architects (Pfeiffer 2006.). It is hereinafter
quoted in part:
The site known today as Zedlerâs Mill was originally developed by John W. Meriwether and
Leonidas Hardeman in 1875-1876. J. K. Walker, a Luling mercantile dealer, purchased Â½
interest in the mill in 1881, and in 1882, sold his share to Orchard and Company which
purchased the remaining Â½ interest. Orchard and Company was a partnership comprised of John
Orchard, J. K. Walker, J. W. Campbell, Robert Innes, and Frank Zedler. The company also
purchased Zedlerâs previous milling operation - the Lamkin-Zedler mill - in 1884. That mill, near
Atlanta in southeast Caldwell County, later became known as the Walker Mill.
Fritz Zedler had been engaged in milling in Central Texas since returning to Texas from Mexico
after the Civil War. He purchased 100% interest in the land and mill just south of Luling in
October 1887 and operated it until 1902 when he retired and sold the property to his sons,
Charles and Herman Zedler. Charles purchased 100% of the mill in 1922, and Charlesâ son, Paul,
acquired the property in 1953. The mill and gin were closed permanently in 1964 and the
property remained in the Zedler family until 1972.
Zedlerâs mill occupies land on the northeast bank of the San Marcos River in Caldwell County.
Today, the mill consists of 9.259 acres. It was once part of a larger parcel owned by the Zedler
family. By 1902, when Fritz and Louise Zedler conveyed the property to their sons, Charles and
Herman, the âZedler mill landâ was comprised of three parcels totaling 10Â¼ acres. The parcels
were as follows:
1) A 3-acre parcel out of the Spencer Morris league on the San Marcos River;
2) A 1-acre parcel out of the Spencer Morris league;
3) A 6Â¾-acre parcel out of the Fuqua Â¼ league. The metes and bounds of these parcels are
outlined in detail in numerous real property recordings including the 1902 deed (CCDR 33:326).
Both Spencer Morris, Sr., and Silas Fuqua were members of Green de Wittâs Colony, established
in 1825 under provisions from the Mexican Colonization Law of 1824, and then adopted by the
State Colonization Law of Coahuila and Texas in 1825 (GLO 2008). De Wittâs empressario
contract specified that the colony should be filled with 400 hard working Catholic families with
good reputations, along with selected Mexican families of the same qualities. Following Indian
depredations and a long dispute over boundaries with MartÃ­n de LeÃ³nâs Colony, 26 additional
families and 31 single men were brought into de Wittâs Colony in 1830, predominantly along the

San Marcos and Guadalupe rivers. Families settling the land for ranching and farming were
allowed one league, or 4,428.4 acres. Single men were allowed Â¼th of a league, or 1,107.1 acres.
The cost to the settlers was $150 for a league, plus survey and title fees. The surveying of their
land grants was accomplished mostly in 1831 and 1832. These later colonists came from the
southern states in the United States (GLO 2005; Handbook of Texas Online 2008).
Spencer Morris, Sr. (3-acre and 1-acre Tracts)
Based upon his receipt of a land certificate for a full league (4,428.4 acres) along the northeast
bank of the San Marcos River on June 25, 1831, it can be presumed that Spencer Morris was a
married man with a family, and that his stated intention was to use the land for stock raising.
Born in 1780 in Alabama, Spencer Morris Sr. joined De Wittâs Colony on February 20, 1831
with his wife Elizabeth, and children Spencer, Jr., Bethel, and Richard. Spencer Morris Sr. is
listed as being a member of the First Texas Ranger Company (the Washington County Guards),
the Army of the Republic of Texas. Morris Spencer, Sr. and his sons Morris Spencer, Jr., and
Bethel are also listed as serving at the Battle of San Jacinto. For his service, Spencer Morris, Sr.
was eventually rewarded with an additional 640 acres in 1853 (Peterson 1995).
Following Spencerâs death, John Morris acting as the administrator of the estate in 1838,
declared that Â½ of the league should be deeded to Mathews & McKean who loaned Spencer
Morris $1,900.00 â...for provisions and supplies to move to Texasâ (GCDR 1838:4). For
securing the loan Mathews & McKean agreed to get Â½ of his league as soon as he could get title
from the Mexican government. Spencer did get the title, but he died before he could give the Â½
title to Mathews & McKean. Spencerâs probate court records were in Washington County at the
time, suggesting that is where he lived before his death. The league was finally partitioned into
seven lots in 1847 ([Figure A-1] [GCDR 1847:221-227]). Notably, the partition resulted in a
total of 4,448 acres versus 4,428.4 acres; presumably due to more accurate survey methods in
later years.
Lot 1 was located in the southwestern portion of Spencer Morrisâ league, and adjoined Silas
Fuquaâs league. It is within Lot 1 where the Zedler Mill was eventually constructed in the late
1800s, and thus was the focus of research. The chain of ownership for Lot 1 leading up to the
construction of the mill site is shown in Table A-1. S. C. Rice was the recipient of Lot 1,
consisting of 438 acres. S. C. Rice died on May 6, 1851 in Gonzales. The administrator of his
will, Daniel B. Friar, sold Lot 1 (438 acres) and Lot 4 (300 acres) to Caleb S. Brown for $929.50
on a mortgage contract on June 21, 1854 (CCDR B:476).

Dr. Caleb S. Brown lived in Gonzales and in 1847 through 1850 was a partner in the Harrison
and McCulloch Stage Line. The line had postal contracts and stage routes that ran from Indianola
through Victoria and Seguin to New Braunfels, and from Austin to San Antonio through
Manchaca, San Marcos, Bonito, New Braunfels, Selma, and then on to San Antonio (Heide
2008). Apparently Dr. Brown did not make the payments on the 438-acre Lot 1, because estate
administrator Daniel Friar petitioned the county court and was awarded both lots back on
February 8, 1853 (CCDR C:345).
The county court in Clinton, DeWitt County then ordered that the two tracts be sold at public
auction on the Caldwell County courthouse steps. William R. Cowan was the highest bidder and
bought both tracts for $1,246.56 on May 3, 1853 (CCDR C:689), receiving official title from
Daniel Friar and Levi Rice on August 9, 1854 (CCDR D:457). William Cowan gave power of
attorney to Theopolis Rogan to sell all of his real estate holdings and to sign all deeds for him on
April 27, 1855 (CCDR E213). On March 24, 1858, William Cowan sold Lot 1 to William
Wallace McNeil (most commonly spelled âMcNealâ) of Tennessee on March 24, 1858 for
$318.00 (CCDR G:239).
William Wallace McNeal served in the Army of the Confederacy from Caldwell County during
the Civil War (Brice 2008), and had numerous holdings in Caldwell County, with several deed
and mortgage transactions on record. When he sold his home plantation to Owen B. Hardeman in
January 1867, he indicated that it was on the Francis Berry headright, not on either the Spencer

Morris or Silas Fuqua leagues (CCDR I:342). He died in 1872 or 1873, and by February 1873,
some of his assets were being sold at a Sheriffâs sale in Lockhart (CCDR O:83). E. W. McNeal, a
brother, became the administrator of Williamâs estate (CCDR P:544).
An exhaustive research of deed records failed to provide a clear line of title to Lot 1 from 1858
through 1874, when John Merriwether sold 100 acres out of the south end of the 438 acres in Lot
1 to Martha Meriwether. Although there are approximately three dozen land transactions
attributed to the McNeals during that period, none appeared to involve Lot 1.

According to Maria Pfeifferâs report (2006), John Meriwhether and family did not arrive in
Texas until the early 1850s, and in 1860 lived in Prairie Lea. By 1874 he had acquired 1,000
acres with livestock and wagons on his plantation, and his name appears in numerous deed
transactions in the 1860s and 1870s. On June 26, 1874, he sold some of his personal belongings
on the plantation, including â...ten work mules ten years old and upward with LH brand, the
same mules used by me where I reside on my plantation in Caldwell County, one blue four-horse
wagon, one ox wagon, one low log wagon, to Harwood, Conway and Winston...â for $1,000
(CCDR P:342). Pfeiffer hints that he may have been liquidating many of his assets in

anticipation of building the gin and mill at Luling. One of the tracts he sold in 1874 was the 100
acres that the 3-acre mill tract is on. He acquired the 3-acre mill tract back in1876, from his
sister, Martha Louise (Meriwether) Huff. In 1859, Martha Louise married Leonard Corder Huff,
a wealthy landowner (Pfeiffer 2006). Leonard died on July 29, 1873 (CCR 2008).
John then entered into an agreement with Leonidas Hardeman to lend his expertise and move his
mill equipment to the site and begin construction of the dam and mill in 1875 (CCDR S:97).
Martha then transferred ownership of the three acres (Â±) that lies between Mill Creek and the San
Marcos River to John Meriwether and Loeonidas Hardeman on November 7, 1876 (CCDR T:3).
This tract is where the standing mill, gin, mule barn, etc. buildings are located.
Leonidas Hardeman and family also lived in Prairie Lea by 1860. Hardeman was operating a mill
elsewhere on the San Marcos (possibly the one at Staples; see Lowman 2008), and agreed to
move his mill equipment to the new site, and engage in building the dam and other structures in
1875 to begin a new operation at what is now known as the Zedler Mill site. They then moved to
Luling in 1877.
Research indicates that the 3-acre tract was the only one out of the Spencer Morris league owned
by the Zedlers until they purchased a 1-acre tract from C. Bellinger and Annie P. Van Gaskin
(guardian of the Joseph Van Gaskin estate - the President of the Luling Real Estate Company)
described as â...north of the Zedler Mill tract and south of the Luling-Belmont Road...â (CCDR
19:413). This is apparently the tract upon which Fritz and Louise built their home on Laurel
Street, across Mill Creek from the original mill tract (Zedlerâs Mill n.d.).
Silas Fuqua (6Â¾-acre Tract)
Silas Fuqua was granted a full league (4428.4 acres), along the northeast bank of the San Marcos
River, indicating that he also intended to use the acreage for agricultural purposes. Archival
research indicates that he came to de Wittâs Colony with a large family. Silas Fuqua was born in
Virginia in 1783, may have moved to Mississippi where he purchased 100 acres of land in
Madison County, Mississippi Territory from a Mr. Charles Cabanifs on May 15, 1815 (Gonzales
County Probate Record #6), and then apparently moved to Alabama, from where he enjoined de
Wittâs Colony. In November 1832, Silas was appointed as the second rigador of the colony
(Rather 1904).
His family consisted of his wife Sally (Taney) Fuqua and seven children: Galba born in 1819;
Fabius born in 1824; Eliza born in 1815; Harriet born in 1817; Caroline born in 1821; Lucas
born in 1822; Sabrina born in 1825. Silasâ youngest son Galba rallied with Byrd Lockhart in
Gonzales, rode with the Gonzales Ranging Company from Gonzales to relieve the Alamo
defenders, and died in the battle there on March 6, 1836, three days short of his seventeenth
birthday (Fuqua, Galba 2008).
His wife Sally died in the late 1820s, but Silas died in Texas in 1834 (Fuqua, Silas 2008). A

listing of Silasâ personal belongings at his death included primarily carpenter, woodworking ,
and farming tools. He also had three cows (Gonzales County Probate Record #6). Although for
this report it has not been ascertained where Silas is buried, the Fuqua-Silas family cemetery is
located five miles east of Luling (Caldwell County Cemeteries 2008). On February 24, 1838 the
grandfather of the Silas Fuqua heirs, a Mr. Tonry, solicited Andrew Panton to act as the
administrator of Silasâ
estate (Gonzales County
Probate Record #6). On
April 1, 1840 Andrew
Panton petitioned the
court â...as the attorney for
the absent heirs...â of Silas
Fuquaâs estate. At the time
there were three absent
heirs (Gonzales County
Probate Record #6). The
league as partitioned is
shown in Figure A-2.
After Andrew Panton had
submitted the costs for
administering
the
distribution of Silasâ estate
in 1839 (ca. $296), the
court ordered that a
portion of Silasâ league be
sold in order to pay those
costs.
Apparently to pay the
$296, Andrew Panton then
paid $49 to Edward
Bellinger to survey a 640acre slice out of the
league,
$12
to
an
auctioneer for auctioning
off the 640 acres, and $3
for drawing up a deed to
the 640 acres.
James B. Patrick submitted the winning bid and on January 14, 1840 bought the 640 acres that
bordered the Spencer Morris league along the San Marcos River for $640 (GTR 1840:29;
Gonzales County Probate Record #6).
For some mysterious but undetermined reason, James B. Patrick turned around and sold the same
640 acres back to Andrew Panton on April 5, less than three months later (GCDR 1840:31). It is

this 640-acre tract that becomes the focus of this research, as it encompasses the 6Â¾ acres that is
now part of the Zedler Mill Park.
On April 26, 1841 John and Eliza (Fuqua) Roads petitioned the court asking that a partition be
made in Silasâ league so that they would receive the portion â...on which they are now living.â
As an aside, they signed their last names spelled âRhodesâ. The court reacted to the petition, and
ordered that the estate be divided into four relatively valued equal parts, and that a survey and
plat of the Fuqua league be conducted and produced ([see Figure A-1] [Gonzales County Probate
Record #6]). The girl in the United States was quite possibly Sabrina Ringer:
1) Part 1 for Eliza (Fuqua) Roads
2) Part 2 for Lucas Fuqua
3) Part 3 for Fabias Fuqua
4) Part 4 for â...a girl in the United States name not known...â
On August 28, 1845 Andrew Panton sold the 640 acres that James B. Patrick had bought at
auction, and then returned to Andrew Panton in 1840, to the Silas Fuqua heirs for $925.85
(GCDR 1845:119). Once again, these transactions are highlighted in Table A-1 because it is
within this 640-acre parcel that 6Â¾ acres of the current Zedler Mill tract are located.

Two of the three heirs of Silas that Andrew Panton refers to in the 1845 deed transaction were
most likely sons Lucas (Lucius) and Fabrias. Son Benjamin, died earlier, and his wife Nancy
Fuqua became the administrator of his estate. On May 26, 1838 Nancy Fuqua was paid $450
from Silasâ estate â...for support maintenance, clothing, etc. of three children...â from October
1834 through January 1836 (Gonzales County Probate Record #6). The third heir could have
been either Nancy Fuqua (widow of Benjamin), Eliza (Fuqua) Roads, or Sophira Ruiger (a.k.a.
Sabrina Ringer), the heir listed as unnamed from the United States (see Gonzales County Probate
Record #6). Nevertheless, the three heirs sold each of their â interests in the 640 acres, along
with other some of their other holdings (see below) within Silasâ league to Samuel M. Coons by
the end of 1849 (CCDR C:734).
Samuel Coons was apparently an absentee landowner. On December 13, 1849 he was residing in
Franklin County, Alabama but signed a deed in New Orleans on that day that conveyed the
following four tracts of land in the Fuqua league to Walter A. Lenoir (CCDR C:734):
1) 640 acres, the same 640 acres that James B. Patrick sold back to Andrew Panton; the same
640 acres that Coons got from the heirs of Silas Fuqua and acquired by the heirs of Silas Fuqua
from Andrew Panton on August 28, 1845.
2) Lot 4 in Block 1 that was partitioned to Lucius Fuqua, a total of 450 acres
3) Lot 1, Block 2, a total of 567Â½ acres
4) Lot 3, Block 1, being the part of Fuquaâs league that was set apart to Sarah [or Sabrina ?]
(Fequa) Ringer, a total of 347 acres

Walter A. Lenoir was also apparently an absentee landowner, from Marion County, Mississippi.
On September 14, 1863 he authorized his Power of Attorney (M. V. Collins) to sell to Nathaniel
A. Hisaw (note spelling) of Gonzales County the following: 1 - 640 acres designated on the
Silas Fuqua partition map (see Figure A-2) as the âA. Panton Tractâ (CCDR H:697) 2 - Lot 1,
Block 2 (Lucasâ 567Â½ acres). A plat map filed with the deed record dated May 11, 1863 is
shown in Figure A-3. (Note: the partition map says 600 acres, but the deed says 640 acres).
Nathaniel A. Hysaw, who was apparently another absentee landowner and recorded as being a
resident of Gonzales County, transferred the following to James Hysaw âof the same residenceâ
on September 14, 1863 (CCDR H:699):
1) 640 acres designated on the Silas Fuqua partition map as the âA. Panton Tractâ
2) Lot 1, Block 2 (Lucasâ 567Â½ acres)
Following the death of James Hisaw, his estate was petitioned on the 23rd of May, 1877 (CCDR
40:248-252). At that time, Jamesâ homestead was in the Smith Creek/San Marcos River area.
The following lands were given to Mrs. L. E. King:
1) 232Â± acres out of A. Pantonâs (Plat A) 640 acres â... beginning at a stake on the NE bank of
the San Marcos River set for the the SW corner of the original [640-acre] lot...â. to a corner near
the Gonzales and Luling Road

2) 162Â± acres to W.R. Hisaw out of A. Pantonâs (Plat A) 640 acres
On the 13th of March 1878, M.A. & L.E. King (from Limestone County) sold the 232Â± acres
from A. Pantonâs (Plat A) 640 acres to George W. Hisaw (CCDR T:61).
George W. Hysaw then sold the 232Â± acres to L.M. Lamkin of Gonzales County (CCDR
U:254). Lewis Lamkin was also the owner of the Lamkin and Zedler Mill in the Andrews
Community southeast of Luling (Pfeiffer 2006). Who held title during the period between 1879
when Lamkin owned the property, and 1902 when Fritz and Louisa Zedler sold the 6Â¾ acres to
sons Herman and Charles is unclear.
The 1902 transaction (CCDR 33:326) states that the 6Â¾ acres is out of the Silas Fuqua league,
and that it is part of 45 acres conveyed to J. K. Walker by the Luling Real Estate Company
([President Joseph Van Gaskin] [CCDR 2:505]), but it provides no other information. John Knox
Walker was a partner in Orchard and Company, as well as the Luling Water Power Company,
along with J. W. Campbell, Robert Innes, and Fritz Zedler (CCDR Z:426; X:152-153). No
records could be found that then later transferred specifically 6Â¾ acres to Fritz Zedler. However,
in researching the original 3-acre mill tract, it was found that deeds pertaining to transferring the
mill tract make no mention of any acreage other than the original three in 1882, 1884, and 1887
(CCDR X:152; 1:300; 4:591). It is likely that the 6Â¾ acres was acquired by Fritz Zedler between
1887 and 1902, but no evidence of that was found.
Summary
Typically with deed transactions in the state of Texas during and following the Civil War, the
deed records in Caldwell County following the 1863 transactions described are vague at best. A
review of all of these transactions has provided no hint that any structures or historic occupation
existed within the 9.259 acres that the Zedler Mill site now encompasses. It appears that the
9.259-acre site of the Zedler Mill was not used for any purpose other than livestock grazing prior
to construction of the dam and mill in the mid-1870s. Because the frequent floods that occurred
on the San Marcos, the area was not regularly farmed (Westbrook n.d.), but likely was used for
raising livestock. The community of Luling was not populated with any intensity until after the
Galveston Harrisburg and San Antonio railroad was extended into the immediate area in 1874
(Pfeiffer 2006). The results of the archaeological investigations during this current project have
provided no evidence of an historic occupation that may have existed at the site. A few
presumably prehistoric pieces of lithic debitage, although in mixed contexts, suggests there may
have been an ephemeral occupation of the site near the confluence of Mill Creek and the San
Marcos River at an indeterminate time in prehistory.

The Structures
Dam and Chute Components
A most comprehensive history of the dam, spillway, penstock (brick chute), and retaining wall
chutes has been provided by Terri Myers (2005). She surmises that the existing dam was
constructed in 1914, the spillway ca. 1920, the penstock and S-curve retaining wall ca. 1939, the
concrete retaining wall ca. 1945, and the concrete superstructure ca. 1950. What is still unclear
are the exact locations of the log head and tail races. Nevertheless, the following is intended as a
minor supplement to Myersâ detailed research.
Construction of the dam across the San Marcos River began in1874 or 1875. One source (Zedler
Mill n.d.:7) states that the first dam was made of logs, while another source indicates they used
stone (Westbrook n.d.). In 1883, Orchard and Company installed a water wheel in order to
provide water to the city of Luling (Westbrook n.d.). It is likely that the dam was improved at
that time because in 1884 the operation was sold â...with the dam improvements...â (Westbrook
n.d.:1). One source (Zedler n.d.:7) states that when the Luling Power Company was organized in
1885, Fritz Zedler built a dam, a head race, a penstock, and a tail race across the San Marcos, all
out of logs. âAs may be noted, the wooden Luling Dam constructed of logs was not an object of
great beauty, but only a casual inspection is required to reveal that it was arranged by a person
possessing skill and an appreciation for propriety. The symmetry employed in placing the logs
and the rigidity of the structure as a whole give evidence that the builder was no noviceâ (Zedler
n.d.:7). Log construction was the most likely. Either way, the frequent floods along the San
Marcos caused them to rebuild the dam several times.
In an unpublished paper on file with the City of Lulingâs Parks Department (Zedler n.d.:8), the
following is an extract:
In the beginning, the two primary purposes of Zedlerâs Mill were to gin cotton and to grind corn.
Power was needed to turn wheels. A hydraulic turbine was selected to accomplish this purpose.
In 1885 Leffel Water Wheels were being manufactured and offered for sale by James Leffel &
Company of Springfield, Ohio. Water wheels of this character were well suited to cause the
rotation of a vertical shaft to which the water wheel was attached even though the fall of the
water was not great - six to ten feet.
The headrace was simply a channel above the dam provided with several gates by the use of
which the flow of water to the penstock could be controlled. When water wheel repairs were
required, the flow of water into the penstock needed to be cut off.
The penstock was a chamber in which the water wheel was mounted at the bottom in such a
fashion that the water could no flow radically into the blades in a horizontal plane and to flow
out tangentially in a vertical plane.

The casing of the water wheel was mounted rigidly on the bottom of the penstock. The rotating
wheel with its vertical shaft was mounted upon a step bearing made of wood. A very special
wood was required. It was obtained from a lignum vitae tree. Vegetation of this character is
found only in tropical regions. This wood has a high density and possesses the capacity to
support heavy loads. When it is submerged in water, it possesses the capacity to lubricate itself.
The lignum vitae bearings at Zedlerâs Mill were formed and shaped with the use of rasps.
One known disaster occurred â...in 1890, when a new penstock collapsed upon having water let
into it (Westbrook n.d.:4). A penstock is either a sluice, gate, pipe, or some type of conduit to
control the flow of water and divert it to a water wheel or turbine. A new penstock was
constructed, and as of 1974, was still in place (Westbrook n.d.:4). In 1894, the water conduits
began to be used as a means of providing electricity to the City of Luling.
Although it is unclear what, if any, improvements were made to the dam and mill race between
1894 and 1914, in 1914 the Zedlers declared that âThe service they were rendering at this time
was summarized in part by the statement that âthe water diverted by means of pump into said
standpipe for the use of the Citizens of the City of Luling is about 600 gallons per minute, and is
about 188,000 gallons; that no part of the water accumulated by said dam is used for any other
purpose except power...â (Westbrook n.d.:4). Lulingâs population increased significantly in the
1920s as a result of an oil boom, so that at some point the needs for sources of water and
electricity beyond the capability of the Zedler operation was necessary to obtain. Those dates
have not been ascertained. However, the dam and accompanying water diversion constructs were
used for the mill operation until 1960 (Westbrook n.d.:4-5).
Gin and Mill Structure
The original gin and mill structure was constructed in the 1870s, but burned to the ground in
1888. Possible evidence of the original construction materials and the 1888 disaster was found in
Shovel Test 2 in the form of square nails and melted glass (see Figures 2, 3, 61, 63). The
structure was supposedly rebuilt that same year. Pfeifferâs report to the City of Luling (2006)
includes Sanbornâs Fire Insurance maps showing the expansion of the structure from 1902
through1907, 1912, 1921, and 1929. In addition, Mr. Engelke has indicated that an informal
architectual review of the structure was conducted by students from Texas A&M University.
Casual observations made by the Principal Investigator, untrained in architecture, during the
current investigation include:
1) partial Portland hard concrete foundation on west end, with river gravel and pebble matrix
2) milled lumber of modern dimensions (not full inch measurements)
3) all round nails; no square nails observed
4) red brick foundation on north side, some yellow bricks on south side, highly fired; hard, solid
mortar
5) machined bolts, nuts, washers, Phillips and regular screws for hardware
6) galvanized, corrugated metal covers roof and sides
7) plywood deck (4x8') on east end
8) some PVC electrical and plumbing conduits; otherwise single strand wiring with porcelain
insulators

9) collapsed firestack on east end has mixed red and yellow bricks, highly fired
Office and Scale House
The initial construction date of the office and scale house (see Figure10) has not been
determined. This structure is shown on 1902, 1907, 1912, 1921, and 1929 Sanbornâs Fire
Insurance maps. Observations made during the current project include:
1) poured Portar mix concrete foundation with river gravel and pebble matrix on the west end
2) milled lumber of modern dimensions (not full inch measurements)
3) board-and-batten exterior
4) red brick, highly fired, foundation on east end
5) structure measures approximately 35' x 20 â with a 12' roof-covered scale on east end
6) all round nails; no square nails observed
7) spring door hinges
8) recently retrofitted with new tin roof, modern electrical and plumbing, shiplap siding
Machine Shed
This structure is located off the northwest corner of the gin/mill structure on the edge and steep
slope above Mill Creek. It measures approximately 21' x 12'. The initial construction date is not
known, but it does appear on a 1929 Sanbornâs Fire Insurance map. Observations of the structure
in February 2008 are:
1) red and yellow brick, highly fired, with strong yellow mortar foundation
2) machined bolts, nuts, and face plates
3) all milled lumber of modern dimensions (not full inch measurements)
4) galvanized, corrugated tin on roof and sides
5) all round nails
6) 6-cylinder flathead gas engine on auto chassis, stick shift, standard transmission, with pulleys
and belts attached to drive train in upper portion of shed
Workshop
Figures 8 and 39 show what we have called the workshop. It measures approximately 21' x 12'
and is of board and batten, milled wood construction with all round nails. It has a low wall on the
southern end and a floor on the northern end constructed of a Portland-based concrete mixture,
with river gravels in the matrix. The hardware observed consisted of machined hinges and
screws. One of several sherds of a broken window in the northern end of the structure measured
2.5 mm in thickness. Using Moirâs regression formula (1987), the probable installation of the
glass in this window occurred some time between 1916 and 1930. Whether it was the initial
installation or a replacement is unknown. This building is shown on the 1929 Sanbornâs Fire
Insurance map.

Helperâs Shack
According to Mr. Engleke (personal communication, January 31, 2008), this structure was used
by a mill employee, possibly the foreman. It measures 21Â½â² x 14â², and is covered with
galvanized, corrugated metal (see Figures 31 and 32). Only round nails were observed, and the
lumber is of standard, milled sizes (not to full inch). It has a pier and beam foundation, with cut
railroad ties used for piers. The electricity in the structure was connected via single strand
electrical wiring and porcelain insulators.
The front of the building has burned in
the not too distant past, damaging the
ceiling and doorway areas. This building
also appears on the 1929 Sanbornâs Fire
Insurance map, as a shack.
Storage Barn
This building is two stories high, and
open to the ceiling, with no lofts, and
located behind the helperâs shed, south of
the mule barn. It is constructed of roughsawn lumber of standard (not full inch)
dimensions, with thick plank floors and
wall studs. The foundation consists of
both brick support columns made of highly fired red brick, and wooden piers. No square nails
were observed; only round nails. The exterior dimensions of the structure are roughly 63â² x 18â².
It is covered with galvanized, corrugated tin (Figure A-4).

Mule Barn/Stables
The exterior of the mule barn is a board and batten type of construction, with a galvanized,
corrugated tin roof (see Figure 34). It has a concrete slab along the front of the stalls, as well as a
concrete foundation wall along the north end. The framing is constructed of rough-sawn lumber
of standard (not full inch) dimensions. No square nails were observed, only round ones. There
are 10 stalls and a hayloft. The exterior of the structure measures approximately 66â² x 38â².

Storage Barn
The storage barn is located off the northwest corner of the mule barn. It is covered with board
and batten on the south half, and shiplap on the north half. Sheet metal has been used to enclose
the front on the north half (see Figure 36). The foundation is brick both piers, and a brick wall on
the north half. The red bricks are highly fired and held together with strong gray mortar. Only
round nails were observed. Its exterior dimensions are approximately 29â² x 10â².

Fritz Zedler House
The archival research discussed in the previous section indicates that on January 23, 1899, Fritz
and Louise Zedler purchased one acre from the Luling Real Estate Company C. Bellinger and
Annie P. Van Gaskin (guardian of the Joseph Van Gaskin estate - the President of the Luling
Real Estate Company) described as â...north of the Zedler Mill tract and south of the LulingBelmont Road...â (CCDR 19:413). This is apparently the tract upon which Fritz and Louise built
their home on Laurel Street, across Mill Creek from the original mill tract beginning in 1899
(Zedlerâs Mill n.d.).
Maria Pfeiffer (2006:10) writes âNo primary source material has been located to document
construction of Fritz and Louise Zedlerâs house c. 1900. Lacking builders and mechanics liens or
other citations, it is assumed that the date of the house was provided by family members...â âThe
design is consistent with this period of residential architectureâ.
Charles Zedler House
According to Randy Engelke (personal communication, 31 January, 2008), this house burned to
the ground ca. 1980 (see Figures 24-29). As Maria Pfeiffer points out (2006:10), although the
family members believed it was constructed about 1900, the structure does not appear on any
Sanbornâs Fire Insurance maps until 1912. In addition, the Portland concrete mix used in the
foundation suggests a post-1910 construction date (Myers 2005:18).
