INTRODUCTION
In 2007, a Phase I cultural resources survey of a 13 square mile area (8320
acres) within the Sam Houston National Forest in southern San Jacinto County,
Texas was conducted by Dixie Environmental Services Company (DESCO) under
the direction of Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA). A report was written
and submitted to the Lufkin office of the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas
by William E. Moore and Edward P. Baxter (2008). The project commenced on
August 27, 2007 and ended on November 29, 2007 upon completion of source
point and access route investigation. There are 125 compartments in the Sam
Houston National Forest, and this seismic survey included portions of nine
compartments, less than ten acres. They are 112 through 114 and 119 through
124. The subsurface was examined through either surface inspections or shovel
testing at pre-determined source points. All access routes to be utilized were
also investigated.
Three previously recorded prehistoric sites were found to be located within
the project area. They are 41SJ38, 41SJ50, and 41SJ54. These sites were
marked in the field and will be avoided by the drillers. This survey identified and
recorded thirteen previously unrecorded prehistoric sites (41SJ194 - 41SJ206).
Six of these sites date to the Late Prehistoric period of Texas prehistory based
on the presence of ceramics and arrow points. One site and one isolated find
are believed to date to the Archaic period of Texas prehistory based on the
presence of dart point fragments. No diagnostic artifacts were found at five sites,
and they are listed in this report as “Unknown Prehistoric.” There is not enough
data to determine the eligibility of the thirteen newly recorded sites. In addition to
the thirteen newly recorded sites, five areas contained two artifacts or less, and
they are described in this report as isolated finds.
All artifacts and records were prepared for curation according to the
guidelines established by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL),
and they have been submitted to the Lufkin office of the National Forests and
Grasslands in Texas where they are currently being curated.
Monitoring by an archaeologist during the drilling phase of the seismic
project was required by the National Forest Service to inspect any source point or
drill access relocations and to insure that the activity avoidance buffers placed
around all identified cultural resource sites were respected. This addendum reports
these monitoring activities.

MONITORING PHASE
The drilling phase of the seismic operation was monitored by an
archaeologist at all times. Environmental conditions during the drilling phase
sometimes forced the relocation of access routes and/or source points. When
this was necessary, the archaeologist surveyed the new locations (Appendix I)
utilizing the same methods as those employed during the initial survey. A “Log of
Source Points Investigated” was kept (Appendix II). The majority of the access
routes and source point moves were relocated along existing logging roads to
minimize the potential for disturbance. At these locations, no shovel tests were
conducted as in the original survey. The single site found (41SJ216) was
delineated as per the established methods and avoided by the drillers. The site
boundaries were painted on trees as directed by the National Forest Service, and
its boundaries were delineated by shovel testing. A shovel test log (Appendix III)
was created that provides information regarding depth of test, grid coordinates,
depth of cultural materials, results of each test (positive or negative), and general
comments (type and number of artifacts recovered and soil type). During the
drilling, all previously recorded sites were visited prior to drilling in order to insure
that the access route was well marked and could be easily followed by the drillers
and to make sure that all site buffers were avoided. If a drill route was close to
an existing site, the archaeologist responsible for monitoring remained with the
drillers during the drilling operations.

SITE DESCRIPTION
Prehistoric site 41SJ216 is in San Jacinto County and consists of six bonetempered sherds (undecorated), one grog-tempered sherds (undecorated), and
twelve chert flakes. One of the bone-tempered sherds is a rim sherd, but it is too
small to determine vessel diameter. This sherd consists of five sherds which were
fitted together. Fourteen shovel tests were excavated at this site, and six were
positive (Appendix III). The lithic artifacts consist of local materials probably
collected in nearby streambeds. Site 41SJ216 is located on the toe slope of a
westward trending slope at an elevation of 150-160 feet above mean sea level
overlooking the East Fork of the San Jacinto River 150 meters to the east. This site
is just above the floodplain. There is a small intermittent stream just to the west of
the site that does not appear on the USGS topographic quadrangle. The map with
shovel test locations appears below (Figure 1). At the time of this survey, the
ground cover visibility was less than ten percent and consisted of leaves and forest
debris. Vegetation consisted of mixed pines and hardwoods. The soil in the area
has been identified as Woodville fine sandy loam, 5 to 12 percent slopes (WoD),
and the amount of disturbance is estimated at 10% to 20% due to forestry
practices. The size of this site is estimated at 800 square meters, and it is classified
as Late Prehistoric based on the presence of the ceramic sherds. The eligibility of
this site in terms of listing in the National Register of Historic Places is unknown.
This site will be avoided; therefore, it will not be affected. The temporary number
assigned in the field was KU-02. It is depicted on the 7.5’ Wescott topographic
quadrangle, and it is in Compartment 114.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
Cultural material recovered during monitoring activities were washed,
cataloged, and placed in analytical categories for proper analysis and
documentation. Lithic debitage was sorted into primary (>75 percent dorsal
cortex), secondary (1 to 75 percent dorsal cortex), tertiary flakes (no dorsal
cortex), biface thinning flakes (lipped platforms, a thin arched longitudinal cross
section), and blocky fragments. Raw material was noted and all debitage was
passed through a set of size-graded nested sieves. Categories for size grades
include (1) >24 mm, (2) 24-12 mm, (3) 12-6.4 mm, (4) 6.4-3.2 mm, and (5) <3.2
mm. Additionally, it was noted whether the raw material exhibited heat alteration.
Ceramic artifacts recovered from the monitoring project were analyzed for the
following attributes: temper exterior decoration, sherd portion, and thickness.
Twelve pieces of debitage were collected during monitoring activities. The
twelve pieces of debitage were classified as chert and all were identified as size
grade three. The twelve pieces were classified as tertiary flakes and exhibited no
noticeable modification of use wear. Additionally, two flakes exhibited evidence of
heat treatment. Although representing a small sample, the presence of tertiary
flakes indicates later stages in the manufacturing process occurred at this site.
Seven sherds were recovered during monitoring activities. They include
one plain grog-tempered sherd and six plain bone-tempered sherds. All of the
sherds were well fired. The bone-tempered sherds exhibit medium to large
chunky pieces of burned bone used as a tempering agent. Some sand and small
particles of hematite are also present within contorted paste. Six of the seven
sherds originated from the body of a vessel. The remaining sherd is that of a
rounded, slightly out-slanting rim (Figure 2). The shape of the rim suggests the
vessel originated from a wide mouth jar or bowl (Figure 3). Four sherds can be
fitted to the rim sherd.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The monitoring phase of this project investigated 194 areas due to source
point and access route relocations, and this resulted in the finding of one
prehistoric site (41SJ216) that is described in this report as a probable campsite
dating to the Late Prehistoric period of Texas prehistory based on the presence
of grog-tempered and bone-tempered sherds. The eligibility of this site for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places is unknown, as making an eligibility
determination was not included in the Scope of Work for this project. The
addition of site 41SJ216 makes a total of 14 newly recorded prehistoric sites
within the Casino 3-D project area. In addition, all previously recorded sites were
monitored during the drilling phase in order to insure avoidance.

7

RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations for site 41SJ216 are the same as for those recorded
during the initial survey phase of this project. The drilling phase avoided site
41SJ216 and investigated all changes in access routes and source point locations.
All previously recorded sites were monitored during the drilling phase in order to
insure that avoidance was achieved. It is recommended that this project has had
no effect on the cultural resources within the project area.
