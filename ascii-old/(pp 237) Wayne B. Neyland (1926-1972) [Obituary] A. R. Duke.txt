IN MEMORIUM
Wayne B. Neyland
1926 - 1972
Wayne B. Neyland, former president of the Texas Archeological Society
(1962), died in Houston on October 27, 1972 at the age of 46.
Wayne was born in Fleetwood, Arkansas, but moved to Alexandria,
Louisiana, while still a boy. His comprehensive knowledge of Louisiana
archeology was acquired during his years of residence in that state. During
World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy as an electricianâ€™s helper on a
minesweeper and was decorated for valor.
In July, 1954, Wayne and his family moved to Houston, Texas. He was
employed by theHouston Chronicle and later went into business for himself.
He immediately became interested in Texas archeology and, in particular, the
archeology of the upper Gulf Coast and the Houston area. He located, and
reported to the University of Texas, many sites in Harris, Chambers, Galveston and Brazoria Counties and became well acquainted with all aspects of
upper Gulf Coast archeology. His knowledge of Gulf Coast pottery was particularly impressive.
Wayne became active in the Texas Archeological Society in the middle
1950s and was a regional vice president [1959-1960), active vice president
(1961) and, finally, president in 1962. He also helped to organize the Houston
Archeological Society in 1959 and was its first president. He also found time
to contribute a number of articles on archeology to various publications.
The University of Texas at Austin has been the recipient of much of the
archeological material collected by Wayne over the years and the University
of Houston recently accepted, from his family, his large library of books on
archeology.
Although his activities were limited by poor health during his last years,
Wayne still found the energy and will to pursue his work in archeology.
Though an amateur, his approach was professional and his archeologica!
knowledge and analytical mind were respected by professional and amateur
alike.
