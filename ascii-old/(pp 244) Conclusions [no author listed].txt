Conclusions
These conclusions may be reached regarding the Gilbert Site:
1. It is a component of the Nortefio Focus and has augmented
knowledge of the focus appreciably.
9..

More specifically, it is probably a village site of the Tawakoni,

Kichai, or Yscani Indians.
3. Styles of certain artifacts indicate that the site was occupied
during the 18th century, principally during the third quarter of the
century.
4. Since the most active Indian traders in the area during the
18th century are known to have been French, much of the European
trade goods found at the site must have been obtained from French
traders operating out of Louisiana.
5. If conclusions 3 and 4 may be accepted, knowledge of 18thcentury French trade goods on the southern plains-guns, beads,
knives, and the like-is enlarged considerably by the findings at
Gilbert.
