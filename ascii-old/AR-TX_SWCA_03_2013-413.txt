ABSTRACT
On behalf of K. Friese and Associates, Inc. (KFA) and the City of Austin (COA), SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for the
proposed Waters Park Relief Main Project in Travis County, Texas. Located in north-central
Travis County, Texas, the project area is approximately 0.77 mile southwest of the North MoPac
Expressway and Parmer Lane intersection in northern Austin, Texas. The work was conducted on
behalf of KFA and COA, a political subdivision of the State of Texas, as part of their compliance
with the Antiquities Code of Texas under Permit Number 6649. Additionally the project is subject
to compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in anticipation of a U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District, Section 404 permit in accordance with 33 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits:
Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim
Guidance Documents dated June 24, 2002) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) (16 USC 470), and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).
The project involves the installation of a 0.6-mile-long, 36-inch-wide wastewater interceptor that
will run generally north/south beginning at Adelphi Lane and ending near the frontage road for
North MoPac Expressway. The width of the right-of-way (ROW) varies throughout the project
area. The proposed alignment from the intersection of Adelphi Lane and Scribe Drive to the
intersection of Leaf Lane and Canter Lane will be located within the current roadway ROW and is
limited to the width of the construction trench. The exact trench width is not known at this time,
but it is not expected to exceed 5 to 6 feet. The ROW from the intersection of Leaf Lane and Canter
Lane to the southern terminus is uniformly 30 feet wide. The depths of impacts are not known at
this time, but are not expected to exceed 25 feet below ground surface. In addition, a 0.5-acre
temporary construction easement surrounds the southern terminus of the line, and a 0.03-acre
temporary access easement will be constructed between the southern terminus and an existing
utility easement. Therefore, the area of potential effects (APE) is defined as the approximately 0.6mile-long proposed wastewater interceptor with a varying ROW width from 5 to 30 feet and
extending to a maximum depth of less than 25 feet, the 0.5-acre temporary construction easement,
and the 0.03-acre temporary access easement.
The investigations included a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel
testing of the project area. The background review determined that one previous archaeological
survey intersects the southwestern corner of the APE and no previously recorded cultural resources
are located within the APE. A total of 42 previously recorded cultural resources are located within
a 1-mile radius of the project area, of which nine (41TV286 and 41TV630–637) are located within
300 meters of the APE. These nine resources represent the late nineteenth-century community of
Waters Park. The historic map review indicated that there are no historic-age resources within the
APE; however, the mid-nineteenth-century community of Waters Park is depicted just to the east
of the APE. During the archaeological survey, SWCA archaeologists examined the entire proposed
APE but focused subsurface investigations on the 0.5-acre temporary construction easement and
the 0.03-acre temporary access easement previously determined to be less affected by residential
and commercial development based on a desktop review. Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey
revealed that the proposed project area is within an urban setting previously affected by overhead
utility lines, existing underground utilities, road construction, and residential and commercial
development.

i

One archaeological site (41TV2441) was newly recorded and two previously recorded cultural
resources (41TV630 and 41TV631) were revisited. Site 41TV2441 is a historic artifact scatter with
artifacts dating from the early to mid-twentieth century. The site is recommended not eligible for
inclusion on the Nation Register of Historic Places (NRHP) based on prior disturbances; lack of
potential for intact, buried cultural deposits; and low research potential. Site 41TV630, a historicage dam, and site 41TV631, a historic artifact scatter and remnants of a historic-age gazebo, are
both associated with the late-nineteenth-century community of Waters Park. The original recorders
recommended further work for both sites. Both sites were revisited during the current investigation
and found to be of sufficient distance from the project area to not be affected by the current
proposed construction activities.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
cultural resources within the APE. As no properties were identified that may meet the criteria for
listing in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an State Antiquities Landmark,
according to 13 TAC 26.8, SWCA recommends no further cultural resources work within the
project area. SWCA recommends the project be granted a determination of No Historic Properties
Affected and clearance to proceed as planned.

impacts are not known at this time, but are not
expected to exceed 25 feet below ground
surface. In addition, a 0.5-acre temporary
construction easement surrounds the southern
terminus of the line and a 0.03-acre temporary
access easement will be constructed between
the southern terminus and an existing utility
easement. Therefore, the area of potential
effects (APE) is defined as the approximately
0.6-mile-long
proposed
wastewater
interceptor, with a varying ROW width from 5
to 30 feet and extending to a maximum depth
of less than 25 feet, the 0.5-acre temporary
construction easement, and the 0.03-acre
temporary access easement. As the project is
solely subsurface in nature, no investigations of
indirect effects to above-ground historic
resources are currently planned.

INTRODUCTION
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey for the proposed 0.6-mile-long City of
Austin (COA) Waters Park Relief Main Project
(Figure 1). Located in north-central Travis
County, Texas, the project area is
approximately 0.77 mile southwest of the
North MoPac Expressway and Parmer Lane
intersection in northern Austin, Texas.
The work was conducted on behalf of K. Friese
and Associates, Inc. (KFA) and COA, a
political subdivision of the State of Texas, as
part of their compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT) under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 6649. Additionally, the project
is subject to compliance with the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in
anticipation of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) Fort Worth District, Section 404
permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C
(Processing Department of Army Permits:
Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current
Interim Guidance Documents dated June 24,
2002) and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 USC 470), and
its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).

SWCA archaeologists examined the entire 0.6mile-long
APE,
focusing
subsurface
investigations on the 0.5-acre temporary
construction easement and 0.03-acre temporary
access easement previously determined to be
less affected by residential and commercial
development based on a desktop review. All
investigations were conducted in accordance
with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and
Council of Texas Archeologist (CTA)
standards, as well as the guidelines provided in
Section 106 of the NHPA. Ken Lawrence
served as Principal Investigator. Alamea
Young conducted the survey efforts with
archaeologist Jessica Ulmer on September 11,
2013.

COA proposes to install a new 0.6-mile-long
wastewater interceptor measuring 36 inches in
diameter. The entire project will be within
COA property. The width of the right-of-way
(ROW) varies throughout the project area. The
proposed alignment from the intersection of
Adelphi Lane and Scribe Drive to the
intersection of Leaf Lane and Canter Lane will
be located within the current roadway ROW
and is limited to the width of the construction
trench. The exact trench width is not known at
this time, but it is not expected to exceed 5 to 6
feet. The ROW from the intersection of Leaf
Lane and Canter Lane to the southern terminus

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The northern terminus of the approximately
0.6-mile-long proposed wastewater interceptor
begins at the intersection of Adelphi Lane and
Scribe Drive. The alignment then progresses in
a southerly direction on the eastern side of
Scribe Drive for approximately 0.36 mile.

At the intersection of Scribe Drive and Leaf
Lane, the alignment turns to the southwest,
following Leaf Lane for 0.13 mile to the
intersection of Leaf Lane and Canter Lane.
From the Leaf Lane and Canter Lane
intersection,
the
proposed
alignment
progresses due south for 0.13 mile to its
southern terminus. An approximately 0.5-acre
temporary construction easement surrounds the
southern terminus. Additionally, 0.08 mile to
the east, and connected to the temporary
construction easement by a previously
constructed
utility
easement,
is
an
approximately 0.03-acre temporary access
easement. This will provide temporary access
to the southern portion of the project area
during construction.

chalk (Fisher 1974). A small portion of the
southern terminus is mapped as Quaternary
Alluvium (Qal) which is comprised of alluvium
and low terrace deposits along streams made up
of sand, silt, clay, and gravel (Fisher 1974).

SOILS
There are four soil units mapped within the
project area (Natural Resource Conservation
Service [NRCS] 2013). From north to south,
the project area is comprised of 23.2 percent
Houston black clay, 64.9 percent Austin silty
clay loam, 10.8 percent Frio silty clay loam,
and 1.1 percent Frio soil.
Houston black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes
(HnB), is found on gently sloping and
undulating ridges and along foot slopes. It is
comprised of a surface layer of very dark gray
clay to a depth of 24 inches. Below, to a depth
of 38 inches, is a dark gray clay. To a depth of
80 inches is a grayish brown clay. At the
bottom, to a depth of 104 inches, is a mottled
clay (NCRS 2013).

From the northern terminus at Adelphi Lane at
Scribe Drive to Leaf Lane at Canter Lane, the
proposed alignment is located within the
current roadway and will be constructed using
an open cut installation method. Where the
alignment heads south from Leaf Lane and
Canter Lane for 0.08 mile, a trenchless
directional drilling method is proposed. From
there to the southern terminus, open trenching
will again be utilized.

Austin silty clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes
(AsB), is found on high ridges that are broad
and irregular in shape. It is comprised of a
surface layer of very dark grayish brown silty
clay to a depth of 14 inches. Below, to a depth
of 34 inches, is a brown silty clay. At the
bottom, to a depth of 48 inches, is light brown
weathered chalk and silty clay loam atop soft
chalk bedrock (NCRS 2013).

The project area is within an urban setting. As
mentioned above, the proposed alignment will
traverse a residential neighborhood for
approximately 0.49 mile. The alignment then
enters a wooded lot surrounded by commercial
development to the east, west, and south and
residential development to the north.

Frequently flooded Frio silty clay loam (Fr) is
found on long narrow areas along stream
channels. It is comprised of a surface layer of
dark grayish brown silty clay loam to a depth
of 50 inches. At the bottom is a layer of pale
brown clay loam (NCRS 2013).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
GEOLOGY
Geologically, the majority of the project area is
mapped as Austin Chalk (Kau), which is a gray
color that weathers to white and is comprised
mostly of a thin-bedded marl with interbeds of
massive chalk, hard lime mudstone, and soft

Channeled Frio soil (Fs) is found in narrow
areas along major streams that drain soils
developed over chalk. It is comprised of a

3

surface layer of dark grayish brown silty clay
loam to a depth of 45 inches. At the bottom is
a layer of pale brown clay loam. Intermixed
into both layers are fragments of the chalk
bedrock (NCRS 2013).

prominent geological feature that marks the
southern and eastern extents of the biotic zone
(Neck 1986). Common mammals of the area
include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), plains pocket gopher (Geomys
bursarius), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus
floridanus), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
raccoon (Procyon lotor), nine-banded
armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), blacktailed jackrabbit, and deer mouse (Peromyscus
maniculatis). Less common are the predatory
mammals including the bobcat, coyote, and
gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteous). In
addition to these common mammals, bison
(Bison bison), mountain lion (Felis concolor),
and black bear (Ursus americanus) would have
been available prehistorically (Davis and
Schmidly 1994; Hudler 2000).

VEGETATION
Travis County lies on the margins of the
Edwards Plateau, Grand Prairie, Post Oak Belt,
and Blackland Prairie vegetative regions as
defined by Correll and Johnston (1979). The
Balcones Escarpment forms a sharp vegetative
boundary between the thin-soiled limestone
uplands and the wide coastal plains.
The Edwards Plateau is dominated by a mixed
live oak (Quercus virginiana)/Ashe juniper
(Juniperus ashei) woodland interspersed with
occasional grassy openings. Other tree species
present in low densities throughout upland
areas of the project area include cedar elm
(Ulmus crassifolia), blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandica), Texas oak (Quercus texana), and
some mesquite. Shrub density varies between
low to dense in upland areas. Species occurring
in low densities include Texas persimmon
(Diospyros
texana),
agarita
(Berberis
trifoliolata), and prickly pear (Opuntia spp.)
with thick, mixed grasses in areas (Hudler
2000; Stein et al. 2003; Van Auken 1988). In
contrast, Hudler (2000:102) notes that pollen
data recovered from north Bexar County
determined that prehistoric indigenous flora
was generally more productive than today. This
research suggests that over the last 12,000
years, the flora community was typically more
abundant and flourishing than is observed in
the region currently (Hudler 2000).

There are at least 75 species of amphibians and
reptiles listed within the Balconian Province
(Blair 1950). The Balcones Escarpment has
been shown to be a major limiting factor in the
movement of these species (Smith and
Beuchner 1947). Bird species composition in
the project area is fairly diverse with numerous
breeding, migrant, and wintering species
present (Kutac and Caran 1994). Common
species, both migratory and resident, found in
the area include bobwhite quail, northern
cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), wood duck
(Aix sponsa), canvasback (Aythya valisineria),
tufted titmouse (Parus bicolor), Berwick’s
wren (Thryomanes bewickii), mourning dove
(Zenaida macroura), northern mockingbird
(Mimus polyglottos), red-tailed hawk (Buteo
jamaicensis),
wild
turkey
(Meleagris
gallopavo), and turkey vulture (Cathartes
aura) (Hudler 2000:20; Kutac and Caran
1994).

FAUNA

CULTURAL SETTING

The project area also falls within the Balconian
biotic zone (Blair 1950). Approximately 50
percent of all non-marine mammal species in
Texas exist along the Balcones Escarpment, the

The proposed project area falls within Central
Texas Archeological Region (Perttula 2004).
Although the archaeological regions are not

4

absolute, they do generally reflect recognized
biotic communities and physiographic areas in
Texas (Perttula 2004:6). The Central Texas
Region, as its name implies, is in the center of
Texas and covers the Edwards Plateau and
portions of the Blackland Prairie east of the
Edwards Plateau. The following synopses
provide basic culture histories of the Central
Texas Region. As no prehistoric sites were
encountered during the cultural investigations,
the following focuses on the historic periods of
Central Texas.

Europeans into the region were probably
Spanish explorers and missionaries (Cecil and
Greene 2013; Foster 1995). Governor
Domingo Terán de los Ríos expedition crossed
through parts of Travis County in 1691–1692
(Smyrl 2013). By 1730, the missions of San
Francisco de los Neches, Nuestra Señora de la
Purísima Concepción de los Hasinai, and San
José de los Nazonis were relocated near present
day Barton Springs (Smyrl 2013).
After Mexico gained independence from Spain,
the newly formed country used a policy of land
grants to encourage settlement in the sparsely
populated northern regions of Mexico. During
the 1830s, grants were issued to many settlers
in Travis County; however, settlement slowed
due to the Texas Revolution and the constant
fear of Comanche raids following the
revolution (Smyrl 2013).

HISTORIC PERIOD
The historic period in Texas began in 1528 with
the encounter between the Pánfilo de Narváez
expedition and a Karankawa group near
Galveston Island. After disaster befell the
expedition, one of the members, Cabeza de
Vaca, spent six years wandering through Texas
in the 1530s. Cabeza de Vaca traversed coastal
Texas and parts of the interior and recounted in
great ethnographic detail the peoples he
encountered. Based in part from his exploits
and suggestions of a kingdom of gold, the
Coronado expedition was formed to search for
a “northern” Cuzco or Teotihuacan and by
1540 the expedition crossed into New Mexico
and Texas (Fehrenbach 2013).

REPUBLIC OF TEXAS ERA
In 1840, the Congress of the Republic of Texas
established Austin (previously known as
Waterloo) as the new capital and shortly
thereafter established Travis County (Smyrl
2013). The city of Austin and Travis County
experienced immense growth in the midnineteenth century due to state government
operations. Population steadily climbed and the
amount of farmland nearly doubled. Cattle and
sheep ranching became the principal form of
livestock in the county and corn production
flourished (Smyrl 2013).The Austin Railroad
Association was established in 1852, in order
to facilitate the shipment of goods (Smyrl
2013).

The following historic discussion focuses on
the Austin region and the significance of this
region during the historic period and the
creation of Texas independence, sovereignty,
and statehood.
EUROPEAN CONTACT

CIVIL WAR ERA

In the early Historic period (A.D. 1630 to
Present), the period of European contact and
settlement in Texas, the general Travis County
area was inhabited by several aboriginal groups
including the Tonkawa, Lipan Apache,
Comanche, and Kiowa (Cecil and Greene
2013; Foster 1995; Smyrl 2013). The first

Texas was a divided state as the Civil War
began in 1861. The new state had fought hard
to be granted admission to the Union; however,
ties to the older states of the south, including
slavery and agricultural practices, were strong.
In fact, the majority of the established and
5

growing Anglo population came from southern
states. This group saw the Civil War and the
election of President Abraham Lincoln as a
threat to the State of Texas and its southern
heritage and institutions (Campbell 2013).

were known to derail occasionally in the
Waters Park area and large granite blocks can
still be observed today in the railroad ROW
(Clark 2013).
The Texas Railroad commission was
established in 1891 to regulate the powerful
railroad companies. By 1900, Texas had more
miles of track than any other state in the Union;
however, these lines still left much of the
expansive western half of Texas with little or
no rail access despite railroad growth (Wallace
2008; Werner 2013).

Central Texas counties were even more
divided, with narrow margins winning in favor
of secession. In Travis County, the 1861 vote
against secession won 704 to 450 despite large
pro-secession demonstrations in Austin (Smyrl
2013).
RECONSTRUCTION AND GROWTH (1865–
1899)

The population of Travis County continued to
climb in the late-nineteenth century with
slightly less than half of the population Austin.
The area was still dominated by small farming
operations. Cotton became the prominent crop
in the area, and cattle and goat still dominated
ranching activities (Smyrl 2013).

Travis County suffered massive economic loss
subsequent to the Civil War brought on by
declining property and livestock values. By
1871, the population of Austin began to grow
again with the influx of new railways systems.
In 1881 the Austin and Northwestern Railroad
(A&NW) was granted ROW from Austin to
Abilene, and in the following years the
company was also contracted to haul granite
from Marble Falls to Austin for the
construction of the new Texas capital building
(Troxell 2002).

THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY–THE
ADVANCEMENT OF RANCHING,
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND TOURISM (1900–
1940)
Smaller, adept, diversified farms and ranches
were abundant on the landscape of the Edwards
Plateau by 1900. The “ranching triumvirate” of
cattle, sheep, and Angora goats set Texas at the
national forefront of ranching production
(Freeman 1994:18). Agricultural crops, such as
cotton, corn, wheat, oats, and various grasses
for hay production further diversified output,
strengthening independent farms and ranches
(Freeman 1994).

North Austin experienced an increase in
tourism with the introduction of the A&NW
line. The small community of Waters Park was
established in 1882. The community was
developed on land purchased by Silas and
Parthenia Summers in 1872 and was originally
called Summers’ Grove (Clark 2013). Portions
of the land were then purchased by A&NW in
1881 and developed into a 5-acre park and
swimming pool in 1882. By the summer of
1882, the park also included a baseball field,
gazebo, picnic grounds, and concession stands
with train excursions running from Austin on
Sundays (Clark 2013). A&NW also
constructed a section house in Waters Park to
help facilitate the transportation of the granite
blocks used for the capital building. Train cars

As railways continued to be built well into the
twentieth century, new roads followed,
creating a linked network. Rails functioned as
the “main arteries of travel” and roads as “the
veins” (Pratt 1910:106). Railroad companies
soon realized that a good road system could
greatly aid their business and they became one
of the most ardent supporters of the good roads

6

movement (Wallace 2008). Road systems also
benefitted from the arrival of post offices. The
Rural Free Delivery (RFD) of mail system
brought mail to isolated ranches and farms.
Postmen refused to use roads in poor
conditions and consistently reported conditions
to the proper authorities when they could not
make their deliveries. The RFD system united
rural roads and postal routes, engaging federal
and state government interests. This new level
of involvement with roads and their
development stretched significantly beyond the
previous scope of county court control
(Wallace 2008).

The Texas legislature responded and in 1931,
all state agencies were required to use only
American-made materials and machinery in all
new construction projects. The Texas Highway
Department worked with the legislature to
make sure Texas firms and material suppliers
received all of the contracts for road and bridge
work. As the depression advanced, the state
legislature and the Texas Highway Department
looked for other ways to increase the number
of jobs for out-of-work Texans. In 1932, the
Texas Highway Department mandated that
machines should be used as a last result and all
construction should be conducted by hand
when possible. In that same year, Texas began
to receive federal aid under the Emergency
Relief and Construction Act. Funding
continued under Roosevelt’s New Deal
programs, which covered 100 percent of the
costs and aided in economic recovery
throughout the state (Wallace 2008).

The fate of road improvement and system
expansion was sealed with the introduction of
the automobile and the Federal Highways Act
of 1917. The new act provided matching
funding to states and regulatory partnerships to
assist with building plans (location, design, and
cost estimates). In response to this act, the
Texas Highway Department was established in
1917. Soon after, the Texas Highway
Department would become the largest agency
in the state (Wallace 2008). By 1917, Texas
was well on its way to creating a new and
complete highway system. The system
included several national marked highway
routes including the nascent Old Spanish Trail
Transcontinental
Highway
(American
Highway Association 1917; Luther 2010).

THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY 1940S–
1960S
Goat, sheep, and cattle ranching remained in
the forefront of the central Texas commerce
well into the mid-twentieth century.
Agricultural crop production of wheat,
sorghum, cotton, pecans, and oats continued on
farms and ranches.
New commercial opportunities rose in the oil
and gas industry throughout the region while
road and electrical infrastructure steadily
improved. Congress passed a $1.5 billion postwar highway bill: Texas received the largest
percentage of these funds (Wallace 2008).

Despite advancements in infrastructure
technology and funding, ranching, and the
budding tourism industry, the Great Depression
took its toll on the towns, farms, and ranches of
Central Texas. The effects of the depression
were not felt initially in Travis County.
However, by the early 1930s, changes began to
occur in local economies. In addition, the small
community of Waters Park, once thriving on
local tourism, experienced a devastating
decline in tourism, and the population steadily
dwindled during the Great Depression (Clark
2013).

Unfortunately for the small community of
Waters Park in north Austin, the tourism
market never recovered. The onset of World
War II brought about further decline in
population and by 1980, only one family tied to
the original residents remained in the Waters
Park area (Clark 2013).

Shovel tests were systematically excavated
within the project area. THC survey standards
call for the excavation of 16 shovel tests per
mile for linear projects with a 100-foot-wide
ROW and three shovel tests per acre for area
surveys between 0–2 acres, or approximately
12 shovel tests for the entire project area.
Shovel tests were approximately 30
centimeters (cm) in diameter and excavated in
20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 meter (m) in depth
or to culturally sterile deposits, whichever
came first. The matrix was screened through ¼inch mesh. The location of each shovel test was
plotted using a handheld GPS unit receiver, and
each test was recorded on appropriate project
field forms.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA performed a cultural resources records
review to determine if the proposed APE has
been previously surveyed for cultural resources
or if any cultural resources have been recorded
within or adjacent to the APE. To conduct this
review, an SWCA archaeologist reviewed the
Pflugerville West, Texas, U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle maps at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and searched the
THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas)
and site files at TARL. These sources provided
information on the nature and location of
previously conducted archaeological surveys,
previously recorded cultural resources,
locations of National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) properties, sites designated as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL), Official
Texas Historical Markers (OTHM), Recorded
Texas Historic Landmark (RTHL), cemeteries,
and local neighborhood surveys. Aerial
photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology
Maps, and the NRCS’s Web Soil Survey were
also examined. Finally, Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay
maps were consulted to identify the presence of
potential historic-age structures.

SWCA conducted a non-collection survey, i.e.,
artifacts were tabulated, analyzed, and
documented in the field, but not collected.

SITE EVALUATIONS
All newly documented archaeological sites
were evaluated in accordance with 13 TAC
26.12 as well as according to the National
Register Criteria for Evaluation (Criteria) as
codified in 36 Code of Federal Regulations,
Chapter 60.4, which states:
The quality of significance in
American
history,
architecture,
archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings,
structures, and objects that possess
integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and
association and

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCA’s investigations consisted of an
intensive pedestrian survey with subsurface
investigations within the project area.
Archaeologists examined the ground surface
and erosional profiles and exposures for
cultural resources. Subsurface investigations
involved shovel testing in settings with the
potential to contain buried cultural materials.
Reconnaissance level survey was employed in
areas found to be heavily impacted by
commercial and residential development.

Park. As mentioned in previous sections, the
Waters Park community was established by the
A&NW in 1882. The community thrived on
tourism during the late-nineteenth century but
was eventually devastated during the first half
of the twentieth century by the onset of World
War I and the Great Depression (Clark 2013).

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW

Site 41TV286, located approximately 150 m
east of the southern terminus, was originally
recorded in 1974 by John W. Clark. The site
encompasses a broad area referred to as the
Waters Park area, including two stores, a
tavern, school, railroad section house and yard,
two residences, two wells, a tavern refuse
dump, and roadbed (Atlas 2013).

A review of the THC’s Atlas indicates that a
single previous archaeological survey
intersects the project area. A survey conducted
in 2003 for TxDOT intersects the southwestern
corner of the APE. During the survey,
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 3223, no archaeological sites were
identified within the portion of the project area
that it intersects (Figures 2 and 3).

John W. Clark revisited the area in 1983, and
recorded the other eight aforementioned sites
within 300 m of the southern terminus of the
alignment. Sites 41TV630–637 each represents
individual components of the historic Waters
Park community (Atlas 2013). Brief
descriptions of each site are presented in
Appendix A.

In addition to the 2003 TxDOT survey
mentioned above, there have been 11
additional archaeological surveys and one
archaeological testing project within 1 mile of
the project area. Most of these investigations
were conducted in the 1980s and are associated
with transportation projects sponsored by
TxDOT, Federal Highway Administration,
Federal Transit Administration, as well
projects sponsored by the COA and the
USACE.

Of the nine previously mentioned sites, seven
(41TV286, 41TV632–634, and 41TV636–637)
were subjected to data recovery before the
construction of the MoPac Expressway. Based
upon this further work, all seven sites were
mitigated and considered to be not eligible for
listing on the NRHP within the ROW of North
MoPac Expressway. The remaining two sites
(41TV630 and 41TV631) were not affected by
construction and remain unevaluated (Atlas
2013).

Within a 1-mile radius of the project area, there
are 42 previously recorded archaeological sites.
Of these, 21 are prehistoric sites and 21 are
historic sites. Additionally, 25 of these sites are
recommended as not eligible for listing on the
NRHP.

Finally, there are no cemeteries or NRHP
properties/districts within 1 mile of the project
area. One historical marker is located 0.2 mile
southwest of Adelphi Lane on Waters Park
Road, approximately 0.2 mile west of the
project area. The Waters Park historical marker
was erected in 1996 and reads:

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive
archaeological survey of the proposed 0.6mile-long Waters Park Relief Main Project.
Reconnaissance level survey was employed for
most of the proposed alignment as portions of
the project area are located within the current
roadway; are already part of a previously
constructed utility easement; and are subject to
bore and jack. Subsurface investigations were
limited to the 0.5-acre temporary construction
easement that surrounds the southern terminus
and the 70-foot-long by 20-foot-wide (0.03
acre) temporary access easement (Figure 2).

Field investigations encountered a densely

commercial development. The majority of the
project
area
traverses
a
residential
neighborhood. This area has been extensively
modified by roadway construction and
residential development. Within this northern
segment of the proposed alignment, no
potential for any intact cultural deposits exists.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
Historic maps dating from 1904–1955 were
reviewed to determine if there are any historicage resources within the project area (Foster et
al. 2006). The 1904 Austin Soils map shows
four buildings located just east of the A&NW
in a community called Watters (likely a
variation of Waters Park). Similarly, the 1932
Travis County map indicates the presence of
the Watters community east of the rail line. The
1955 Austin 15-minute topographic map
indicates one historic-age building located west
of the rail line and east of the project area. None
of the maps shows any historic-age buildings
inside the APE (Foster et al. 2006).

As mentioned previously, the southern end of
the proposed alignment is located within a
densely wooded lot, bordered by residential
development to the north and an unnamed
tributary to Walnut Creek to the south. The
existing permanent easements are marked by a
pedestrian trail composed of angular cobbles
submerged in coarse concrete. The same
cobble and concrete mixture was observed
lining the banks of an unnamed tributary to
Walnut Creek within the southernmost portion
of the 0.5-acre temporary easement. The
existing permanent easements have no
potential to contain intact cultural deposits.

feet wide and 3 shovel tests per acre for project
areas 0–2 acres in size. SWCA exceeded the
number of shovel tests for the 0.5-acre
temporary construction easement and the 0.03acre temporary access easement, but extensive
prior disturbances precluded shovel testing in
all other areas of the alignment.
One new site (41TV2441) was documented and
two previously recorded cultural resources
(41TV630 and 41TV631) were revisited during
the current investigation. Although the
previously recorded cultural resources are
recorded outside the proposed APE, the areas
were revisited in order to assess the previous
site boundaries. As discussed below, site
41TV2441 is recommended as not eligible for
listing on the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL, and sites 41TV630 and 41TV631 will not
be affected by the current proposed
construction activities.

The 0.5-acre temporary construction easement
that surrounds the southern terminus and the
70-foot-long by 20-foot-wide (0.03 acre)
temporary access easement contains dense
thickets of immature hardwoods and green
briar. Ground surface visibility is generally low
(less than 30 percent) and the landform slopes
gently to the south. The southernmost portion
of the temporary construction easement is
traversed by an existing permanent easement
paralleling an unnamed tributary to Walnut
Creek to the south. The temporary access
easement and the northern portion of the
temporary construction easement appear intact
with only moderate amounts of modern trash
observed on the ground surface.

41TV2441
Site 41TV2441 is approximately 0.13 mile
northwest of the intersection of North MoPac
Expressway and Water Park Road and
immediately east of the 0.5-acre temporary
construction easement (Figure 3). The site is
situated on a mostly level rise overlooking the
confluence of Walnut Creek and an unnamed
tributary drainage 0.06 mile to the south. The
surrounding vegetation consists predominately
of immature hardwood trees, green briar, tall
grasses, and sparse mature live oak trees.
Ground surface visibility ranges from 0–20
percent. The site is bordered by a low-lying,
erosional wash to the northeast, and to the
edges of the landform to the south and
southeast.

A total of 13 shovel tests (AY01–06 and JU01–
07) were excavated in and around the project
area (Appendix B). Overall, shovel tests were
excavated to an average depth of 30 cm below
surface (cmbs) and consisted of silt loam with
an abundance of angular, limestone gravels.
Shovel tests terminated at shallow limestone
bedrock or compact, gravelly soils. Notably,
only one shovel test (JU04) was positive for
cultural material, which was excavated during
the investigation of site 41TV2441, discussed
below. The THC’s survey standards for
projects of this size recommend 16 shovel tests
per linear mile when the ROW measures 100

Disturbances to the site area include
bioturbation, foot traffic (as evidenced by
modern trash), and minor erosion; however, an
abundance of flood debris was observed within
the low-lying, erosional wash to the northeast.
The site area is subjected to periodic flooding
episodes.

DURAGLAS. These marks correspond to
manufacture dates spanning the early and midtwentieth century (IMACS 2001).

The historic artifact scatter was initially
discovered during the survey when a small
accumulation of historic-age cans and clear
glass jars were observed on the ground surface
just east of the temporary construction
easement. A total of five shovel tests (AY04–
06 and JU04–06) were excavated during site
delineation, of which one (JU04) was positive,
containing one patinated shard of clear glass at
0–10 cmbs. Soils consist of shallow, dark
brown, silty clay loam that includes an
abundance of angular limestone gravels. All
shovel tests revealed shallow limestone
bedrock. The site is bound by negative shovel
tests to the west, a low-lying erosional wash to
the north, and the extent of the landform to the
east and south.

Figure 4.
Clear glass bottles and jars
observed on the ground surface.
Three crushed cans were observed intermixed
with the complete glass jars and bottles. These
cans exhibit crimped seams characteristic of
sanitary cans. Seam crimping was introduced
in the late nineteenth century, was in common
production by the early twentieth century, and
continues through to modern times (IMACS
2001). Also of note, one partially crushed,
hole-in-top can was observed on the ground
surface approximately 30 feet northwest of the
can and bottle dump (Figure 5). The top of the
can contains a pinhole vent covered by lead and
an opening consisting of opposing punched
holes, likely from an ice pick.

Artifacts on the surface include one piece of cut
limestone, three complete clear glass bottles,
five complete clear glass jars, three clear glass
bottle necks, 10 shards of clear glass, one clear
glass platter fragment with embossed floral
designs, two white earthenware fragments,
three crushed sanitary cans, and one deformed,
hole-in-top, tin can (Figure 4). As mentioned
above, subsurface artifacts are limited to one
clear glass shard encountered in shovel test
JU04 at 0–10 cmbs. One rectangular cut piece
of limestone was observed at roughly 60 feet
southeast of the historic dump. The limestone
block measures approximately 15 inches long,
4 inches tall, and 4 inches thick. No markings
were observed on the limestone block and no
other possible structural elements were
observed. Makers’ marks embossed on the
complete glass bottles and jars include HAZEL

structures.
The site lacks integrity, features, and the
potential for significant subsurface deposits.
Based on these factors, the site has limited
potential to yield new and beneficial
information important to the history of the
region. SWCA recommends site 41TV2441 as
not eligible for NRHP inclusion and not
eligible for designation as a SAL. As such, no
further work or avoidance is recommended for
the site.

Hole-in-top can observed on
the ground surface.

41TV630

Hole-in-top cans, commonly used for
condensed and evaporated milk, were
introduced around 1900 and were still in use
through the 1990s (IMACS 2001). Although
the can was crushed, which prevented getting a
more
accurate
measurement,
the
manufacturing techniques suggest early to midtwentieth-century dates.

Site 41TV630 is a late nineteenth-century dam
associated with the historic community of
Waters Park. The site was originally recorded
in 1983 by John W. Clark and is located
approximately 450 feet west of the intersection
of North MoPac Expressway and Waters Park
Road and 300 feet east of the APE (Atlas
2013).

Many of the artifacts observed at site
41TV2441 date to the early to mid-twentieth
century. While the beginning and end dates of
the site occupation are unclear, the site was in
use during this time at least. No structural
elements or buried foundations were observed.
All shovel tests encountered shallow, limestone
bedrock indicating no potential for intact,
buried cultural deposits.

At the time of initial recording in 1983, site
41TV630 was described as a concrete dam
located at a low water crossing on Walnut
Creek. The original recorders indicated a date
of ca. 1888, which corresponds to the late
nineteenth-century to early twentieth-century
community of Waters Park (Atlas 2013). As
discussed in previous sections, the dam was
built by the A&NW on Walnut Creek to create
a swimming pool for the local residents. With
weekend transportation provided by the
railroad, the community became a popular
vacation spot for many people traveling from
central Austin (Atlas 2013). The original site
form does not mention the presence of any
temporally diagnostic artifacts or inscriptions
in the concrete. The dam was reported to be in
good condition and the original recorders
recommended detailed measurements and
drawings. No recommendations concerning

SUMMARY
Site 41TV2441 clearly does not meet Criteria
A, B, or C of 36 CFR 60.4, but SWCA
evaluated the site for eligibility under Criterion
D, which considers its ability to yield
information important in prehistory or history.
Site 41TV2441 is a small historic artifact
scatter. The site contains artifacts with
manufacture dates spanning a large portion of

NRHP eligibility or site significance were
made.

No temporally diagnostic artifacts were
observed in association with the structure. An
accumulation of modern trash was observed in
the creek bed west of the dam and one
weathered post was observed just south of the
structure. Existing permanent easements,
currently used as pedestrian walkways, extend
north and south from the structure and the dam
has been affected by public access as evidenced
by extensive graffiti and the presence of
modern trash.

Site 41TV630 was revisited during the current
investigation and found to be in similar
condition to the previous recording (Figure 6).
The dam consists of two concrete levels sitting
atop large, limestone boulders. Each level is
roughly 3 feet in height, culminating in a
maximum height of 6 feet above water level.
The dam measures 10 feet wide (east-west) and
50 feet long (north-south) and contains two 6foot-tall concrete support walls located on the
cutbanks of Walnut Creek, extending
approximately 20 feet downstream (west) from
the dam structure.

SUMMARY
Site 41TV630 is a late nineteenth-century
historic dam, originally recorded in 1983. The
dam was originally constructed in the latenineteenth century by the A&NW to fuel a
tourist-based economy in the community of
Waters Park. As mentioned before, the
community thrived in the late-nineteenth and
early-twentieth centuries but declined rapidly
following World War I. The initial recorders
recommended further work in the form of
detailed measurements and drawings.
The current investigation found the dam to be
in good condition. Two inscriptions, dating to
1929 and 1933, indicate repeated repairs of the
structure over time. The dam is located 285 feet
east of the proposed temporary construction
easement and will therefore not be affected by
construction activities. SWCA did not
encounter any evidence to refute the original
recommendations for this site.

Figure 6.

towards pool entrance; facing north.
Two inscriptions were observed on the lower
level of the dam. The first inscription is located
on the north end of the dam adjacent to a
concrete support wall. The inscription reads: W
[not legible] 1929/INGE/ROSEMARY. The
second inscription is located on the lower level
on the south end of the dam. The inscription
includes a drawing of a fish and reads: WA/
1933. As both coarse-grained and fine-graded
concrete were observed on the structure, the
inscriptions are likely from later repairs to the
structure.

41TV631
Site 41TV631 is composed of the remnants of
a late-nineteenth-century gazebo and artifact
scatter associated with the historic community
of Waters Park. The site was originally
recorded in 1983 by John W. Clark and is
located approximately 550 feet northwest of
the intersection of North MoPac Expressway

and Waters Park Road and 436 feet northeast
of the APE (Atlas 2013).

fragment contains portions of a hand-painted
decoration consisting of alternating red, blue,
and green brush strokes. No visible makers’
marks were observed on any of the ceramic
fragments.

At the time of initial recording in 1983, site
41TV631 was described as the remnants of a
historic gazebo, consisting of hollow stone
piers, portions of a stone wall, and a
foundation. The original recorders indicated a
date of ca. 1888, which corresponds to the late
nineteenth-century to early twentieth-century
community of Waters Park (Atlas 2013). The
initial recorders reported that the site had been
severely affected by bulldozing, leaving the
majority of the site destroyed; however,
detailed drawings and excavation was still
recommended.
No
recommendations
concerning NRHP eligibility or site
significance were made.

An accumulation of cut limestone fragments,
concrete block fragments, and wooden posts
were observed along the edge of the landform
in the southwestern portion of the site. These
structural elements were observed haphazardly
dispersed along the slope and intermixed with
natural limestone cobbles and gravels. The
ground surface in this area is undulating and
appears unnatural, possibly representing the
remnants of an old push pile slowly eroding
downslope.

Site 41TV631 was revisited during the current
investigation and found to be in similar
condition to the previous recording. The site is
situated on a level rise north of Walnut Creek.
A low-lying erosional wash borders the site to
the west and contains an abundance of modern
trash and flood debris. Vegetation consists of
dense pockets of hardwood trees, vines, and tall
grasses separated by bulldozed paths. Old push
piles, now overgrown with vegetation, were
observed in the site area.

The current investigation found a sparse scatter
of historic artifacts and structural debris.
Artifacts observed on the ground surface
include white earthenware fragments, greenglazed earthenware fragments, two clear glass
bottle bases, one clear bottle glass shard, one
clear window glass shard, one miscellaneous
metal fragment, wire fencing, weathered
wooden posts, cut limestone fragments, and
concrete blocks. One of the clear bottle bases
includes the embossed mark of DURAGLAS,
dating to the mid-twentieth century (IMACS
2001). One very porous earthenware fragment
was observed and is composed of a light gray
paste and cream-colored slip (Figure 7). The

SUMMARY
Site 41TV631 is the remnants of a latenineteenth-century gazebo and historic artifact
scatter, originally recorded in 1983. The site
area was likely associated with the community
of Waters Park. The initial recorders found the
site to be mostly destroyed by past bulldozing
and recommended further work in the form of
detailed drawings and excavation.

17

The current investigation found the site to be in
similar condition to the original recording.
Evidence of past bulldozing was observed
throughout the site area. In addition, all
artifacts are fragmented and were observed in
and around old push piles. The site is located
225 feet east of the proposed temporary
construction easement and will therefore not be
affected by construction activities.

width from 5 to 30 feet and extending to a
maximum depth of less than 25 feet.
The investigations included a background
review and an intensive pedestrian survey with
shovel testing. The background review
determined that one previously conducted
archaeological
survey
intersects
the
southwestern corner of the temporary
construction easement and that no previously
recorded archaeological sites are located within
the APE. The late-nineteenth-century to earlytwentieth-century community of Waters Park is
located east of the project area and contains
nine previously recorded sites (41TV286 and
41TV630–637) within 300 m of the project
area. The historic map review determined there
are no historic-age properties within the APE.

SWCA did not encounter any evidence to
refute the original recommendations for this
site.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of KFA and COA, SWCA conducted
an intensive cultural resources survey on the
0.6-mile-long Waters Park Relief Main Project.
The work was conducted as part of the
sponsor’s compliance with ACT (Permit
Number 6649) and the NHPA in anticipation of
a Section 404 Nationwide Permit from the
USACE Fort Worth District.

Reconnaissance level survey was employed for
most of the proposed alignment as portions of
the project area are located within the current
roadway; are already part of a previously
constructed utility easement; and are subject to
bore and jack. Subsurface investigations were
focused on the 0.5-acre temporary construction
easement that surrounds the southern terminus
and the 70-foot-long by 20-foot-wide
temporary access easement.

COA proposes to install a new 0.6-mile-long
wastewater interceptor measuring 36 inches in
diameter. The entire project will be within
COA property. The width of the ROW varies
throughout the project area. The proposed
alignment from the intersection of Adelphi
Lane and Scribe Drive to the intersection of
Leaf Lane and Canter Lane will be located
within the current roadway ROW and is limited
to the width of the construction trench. The
exact trench width is unknown at this time, but
it is not expected to exceed 5 to 6 feet. The
ROW from the intersection of Leaf Lane and
Canter Lane to the southern terminus is a
uniform 30 feet wide. The depths of impacts are
not known at this time, but are expected not to
exceed 25 feet below ground surface.
Therefore, the APE is defined as the
approximately
0.6-mile-long
proposed
wastewater interceptor, with a varying ROW

Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey
revealed that the majority of the proposed
project area traverses an urban setting. The 0.5acre temporary construction easement and the
70-foot-long by 20-foot-wide temporary access
easement are located within a densely wooded
area just north of an unnamed tributary to
Walnut Creek. Shovel testing (n=13) revealed
shallow, rocky soils overlying limestone
bedrock. Only one shovel test (JU04),
excavated during the investigation of newly
recorded site 41TV2441, was positive for
cultural material. Two previously recorded
sites (41TV630 and 41TV631) were revisited
to assess project effect.

18

Site 41TV2441 is an early to mid-twentiethcentury historic artifact scatter located
immediately adjacent to the 0.5-acre temporary
construction easement. Artifacts were observed
on the ground surface and to a maximum depth
of 10 cmbs. The site lacks integrity, features,
and the potential for significant subsurface
deposits. Based on these factors, the site has
limited potential to yield new or beneficial
information important to the history of the
region. SWCA recommends site 41TV2441 as
not eligible for NRHP inclusion. As such, no
further work or avoidance is recommended for
the site.

SWCA did not encounter any evidence to
refute the previous recommendations.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has
made a reasonable and good faith effort to
identify cultural resource properties within the
APE. As no properties were identified that may
meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP
according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as
an SAL, according to 13 TAC 26.8, SWCA
recommends no further cultural resources work
within the project area. SWCA recommends
the project be granted a determination of No
Historic Properties Affected and clearance to
proceed as planned.

Site 41TV630 is a late-nineteenth-century dam
associated with the historic community of
Waters Park. The site was originally recorded
in 1983, and reported in good condition.
Further work in the form of detailed drawings
and measurements was recommended. The
current investigation found the dam to be in
similar condition to the original recording. The
dam is located 295 feet east of the proposed
temporary construction easement and will
therefore not be affected by construction
activities. SWCA did not encounter any
evidence
to
refute
the
previous
recommendations.
Site 41TV631 is composed of the remnants of
a historic-age gazebo, likely dating to the latenineteenth-century to early-twentieth-century
community of Waters Park. The site was
originally recorded in 1983, and was reported
in poor condition due to prior bulldozing
disturbances. Further work in the form of
detailed drawings and excavation was
recommended. The current investigation found
the site to be in similar condition. The site is
located 225 feet east of the proposed temporary
construction easement and will therefore not be
affected by construction activities. Based on
the current proposed alignment, site 41TV631
will not be affected by the current project.
