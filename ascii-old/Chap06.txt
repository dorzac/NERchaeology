Chapter 6: Pollen and Macrobotanical Remains

POLLEN SAMPLES
As in most other Texas archeological sites of comparable age, pollen is poorly
preserved in the bench sediments at Berger Bluff. While pollen can be well preserved in
consistently wet sites (such as peat bogs) or dry sites (such as rockshelters), it is rarely
preserved in open sites with alkaline sediments in south Texas (Bryant and Holloway
1985:60), although Bruce Albert has been successful in recovering pollen from terrestrial
and marine sites near Victoria and Corpus Christi. Some pollen was recovered from the
bench, but the pollen spectrum is severely reduced and biased by diagenesis, and little
useful information was recovered. Grain counts are very low, and the taxa identified are
mostly those that preserve well or can easily be identified when degraded. Similar results
were obtained from two test samples from the upper deposits examined in 1977 by
Vaughn Bryant. Bryant examined samples from Test Pit 1, excavated during the initial
testing phase at the site. He found no pollen at all in a sample from the 30 cm level, and
only “a few grass and oak” from a sample at 120 cm (letter of July 1, 1997, Vaughn M.
Bryant to Anne Fox).

In February, 1981, two test samples from unit N113 E98 (at 92.40-92.30 m and
92.15-92.10 m) were sent to Dr. Anne Woosley, Department of Anthropology, Southern
Methodist University, to determine if any pollen was preserved. She reported (letter of
August 20, 1981) that pollen was present in very low frequencies, and she ran each
sample three times, with four slides per sample (for a total of 12 per sample) in an
810

attempt to increase the grain counts. Table 6.1 lists pollen grain counts only for these two
samples, and I have summed the counts for the 12 slides in each sample.

Woosley used the Modified Chevron extraction method (Woosley 1978:Table 5)
which omits strong alkali washes and heavy liquid separation, and uses micromesh sieves
to produce size-graded subsamples. For the Berger Bluff samples, she used 1 g of sample,
dried for 24 hours at 50° C for each preparation instead of the standard 50 g (letter of
May 11, 1982).

In addition to the pollen grains, many spores were also present on the slides. In
fact, over 5200 spores were counted from the 92.40-9.30 m sample, and over 6300 from
the 92.15-92.10 m sample, representing several different types (Sphagnum, Lycopodium,
Pteridium, Botrychium, Tilletia, Osmunda, Dicranum, Lycoperdon and other types; letter
of September 1, 1981). This was a wholly unexpected finding. The fact that the spores
greatly outnumber the pollen grains (by a ratio of 55:1) suggests they could be recent
contaminants, and it appears possible that the spores (and possibly some of the pollen
grains) are present because of some sort of contamination of the pilot samples. Tilletia is
wheat rust, and is thought to be a historic introduction.
811

After these results were received, a single column of 26 pollen samples was
submitted to Richard G. Holloway of Texas A&M University in October, 1981, and the
analysis results for 24 samples were received in April, 1982. Pollen samples were
extracted from the “phytopol” samples collected from the southwest corner of units N109
E103 and N110 E102 (Fig. 3.4). The collection procedure is described in Chapter 3; a
total of 25 samples came from the matrix column in the southwest corner of N110 E102,
and a 26th sample was added from N109 E103 to increase the column height. Holloway
used a pollen extraction procedure that differs from that used by Woosley. His protocol is
as follows:
Fifty milliliters of sample were placed in a centrifuge tube. DMSO (Di-methyl
sulfoxide, 99%) was added to cover the sediment. The solution was heated in a
hot water bath for one hour. The material was then screened through 200 μm
mesh screen and treated successively with HCl and HF. After washing with water,
the residue was treated with zinc chloride (1.99-2.00 S.G.) and acetolyzed. After
acetolysis the residue was dehydrated with an ethanol series and transferred to
1000 cs silicon oil with butanol (letter of April 26, 1982).

Table 6.2 lists the results obtained by Holloway. Several things are apparent from
comparing these two tables. Woosley was able to obtain much higher grain counts for her
two samples by processing larger quantities of sediment and preparing 12 slides per
sample. Holloway found very few spores and only two grains of pine pollen, in contrast
to Woosley’s samples, where pine was the most abundant arboreal taxon and large
numbers of spores were present. Oak and composites were found in both analyses. There
is no evidence of contamination in the samples I sent to Holloway.

Holloway’s data show that pollen is very poorly preserved, but is better preserved below
92.15 m (the upper contact for stratum 2A) than above, probably because the lower levels
were more consistently below the water table and less subject to seasonal wetting and
drying cycles. Alkaline sediments (even pH above 6.0), oxidizing conditions, and
frequent wet-dry cycles tend to result in severe pollen degradation and taphonomically
biased assemblages (Holloway 1989; Bryant et al. 1994). Hunt (1994:116) observes that
In general, palynomorphs resistant to microbial degradation and oxidation (such
as fern spores, Compositae pollen and bisaccate gymnosperm pollen) tend to
survive in the fluvial environment far longer than less resistant forms…. Pinus
and other bisaccate pollen is often ‘over-represented’ in waterlaid sediments… as
are Compositae pollen and fern spores… The same taxa are also very resistant to
decomposition in soil profiles.

There is no reason to interpret the anomalous pollen results from N113 E98 as any
kind of indication of disturbance. As the west wall profile (Fig. 4.36, 4.37) shows, there
are some small sand pockets in stratum 2C, but the levels from which the pollen samples
were collected are undisturbed. It is also worth noting that discrepancies between these
same two analytical approaches also occurred at Joe Pool Lake. The reader is urged to
read Holloway (1988) for further elaboration.

Little can be said about the local or regional vegetation based on these data.
Isolated grains of oak (16), pine (2), cottonwood (2), willow (1), Carya (1, probably
pecan, rather than hickory), and sweetgum (1) were recovered by Holloway. High-spined
composites produced 45 grains, low-spined composites 14 grains, Cheno-Ams 2 grains,
and Liguliflorae, 1 grain. Although not normally thought of as being part of the local
vegetation, there are actually isolated pines (single trees or groves, Fig. 1.20) in the area
now, and the nearest pine tree I am aware of that appears to be naturally occurring is
814

located on Sandies Creek, just south of Leesville, about 32.5 km north-northwest of the
head of the Berger Bluff catchment. Loblolly pine should be well-suited edaphically to
the sandy Miocene soils in the catchment, requiring only enough moisture and low
enough temperatures to survive. In its core area, it can persist on as little as 5.6 cm of
precipitation in January and 4.7 cm in July (see discussion in Chapter 1), which is
roughly equivalent to modern conditions in the catchment (Figs. 1.14, 1.15). Youngman
(1965:111) found that loblolly pine seedlings from isolated stands in south-central Texas
were better adapted to dry conditions than east Texas seedlings. When pine is not a part
of the local vegetation, its pollen is often ascribed to long-distance transport, and indeed
Hall found pine pollen throughout his 320 km-long transect of pollen traps from the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico out onto the Llano Estacado near Dalhart
(Hall 1990:Fig. 15), demonstrating that airborne pine pollen can travel hundreds of
kilometers. Pine pollen was also recovered by Albert (1999:Table 1) in both modern and
early historic context from Mission Rosario in Goliad County. It has also been found
elsewhere in prairie habitats where there are no native pine trees (Hall 1992).
Nevertheless, there also exists the untested possibility that loblolly pine might have been
more extensive in the past. Although it appears to be at or beyond its environmental
tolerance limits now, greater precipitation and lower temperatures in the Younger Dryas
and early Holocene might have allowed it to expand its range, and the isolated loblolly
pines now seen from Gonzales County to the northeast (Youngman 1965:Fig. 1) might be
relicts of a more extensive population similar to the Lost Pines of Bastrop County. The
two grains of pine pollen found by Holloway offer no way to test this proposition,
however. The single grain of sweetgum (Liquidambar) pollen also represents a taxon that
is no longer a part of the local vegetation, but isolated grains of sweetgum pollen in early
contexts at South Soefje Bog, Hershop Bog, Winston’s Cave, Friesenhahn Cave, the
815

Richard Beene site, and the Devil’s Mouth site (see discussion at the end of Chapter 2)
also suggest the possibility that sweetgum might have been a minor component of
floodplain forests in the region in the Younger Dryas and early Holocene.

PLANT MACROFOSSIL REMAINS
In October, 1981, nine very small charcoal samples were submitted to Phil Dering
for possible taxonomic identification (Table 6.3). These were all collected as potential
radiocarbon samples. Dering was only able to identify four of these, consisting of elm,
Carya (probably pecan), oak, and Juniperus (probably eastern red cedar). Also listed are
two other macrofossils that I identified myself.

In addition to the nine samples submitted to Dering, there are many more

submitted because they are too small or poorly preserved for identification.
816

UNIDENTIFIED CHARRED MONOCOT (?)
A small patch of charred plant material was recovered from unit N113 E98
(92.20-92.15 m), extracted from an un-numbered radiocarbon sample that was collected
on April 17, 1980. It resembles a small fragment of charred grass, sedge, or rush-like
material that had been trampled into wet calcareous mud and somehow preserved (Fig.
6.1). I identified it as a possible monocot, and in November, 1996, Phil Dering examined
it under magnification up to 70X and confirmed the identification.

Figure 6.1. Unidentified Charred Monocot. Note vertical grain of charred grasslike
material embedded in calcareous mud.

817

UNIDENTIFIED TREE RESIN OR SAP
A small fragment that appears to be hardened tree resin or sap was recovered from
unit N109 E96 (92.75-92.70, bulk matrix, coarse fraction). Examination under
magnification reveals that it has conchoidal fracture patterns, surface cracking and white
secondary carbonate deposition, indicating that it is probably contemporary with the
bench deposits and not a recent intrusive specimen. There are any number of species now
or perhaps formerly present in the Berger Bluff catchment that could produce tree resin
like this, including various members of the Fabaceae or Cupressaceae (mesquite, eastern
red cedar, pine, cypress, sweetgum, various acacias and other species). Sap production is
especially likely when insects attack these species. Amber is also known from Eocene
deposits in the region, but this specimen does not appear to be amber.

A second piece of resin was also recovered from N109 E96 (92.55-92.50) from
the 1/4-inch mesh screen (lot B-134), but is believed to be intrusive, and consequently is
not listed in Table 6.3. It is a very small reddish brown piece with no weathering or
carbonate deposition, and could very well represent resin from the yellow pine lumber
used in the fieldwork for screening sticks or excavation screens. It is considered a
contaminant.

HACKBERRY SEED COATS
The calcareous, biomineralized endocarps of hackberry (Celtis sp.) are common
occurrences in south and southwest Texas archeological sites. Sugarberry (Celtis
laevigata) and granjeno (Celtis pallida) are both reported from the reservoir area (Espey,
818

Huston & Associates 1976:Table 2-18), and Lindheimer hackberry (Celtis lindheimeri) is
also found in south Texas. The endocarps are mostly calcium carbonate (Cowan et al.
1997:269) and will dissolve in hydrochloric acid. They also contain minor amounts of
silica, potassium, magnesium, and sulfur. Examples from the bench are usually medium
gray or beige in color and fairly well preserved, although they are brittle and will easily
divide into halves or shatter into small fragments. Some rodents will cache these seeds,
and caches are sometimes found in archeological sites, but none were found in the bench
deposits. Instead, all examples were isolated finds and are believed to be natural,
“background” components of the floodplain sediments. Table 6.4 shows hackberry seed
finds from the bench deposits, mostly from the westernmost units. Specimen counts are
not indicated because fragmentation makes it difficult to determine minimum numbers of
individuals.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS FOR CHAPTER 6
Pollen and plant macrofossils are poorly preserved in the bench deposits. Pollen
has probably been affected by seasonal wetting and drying, especially in the upper part of
the section, by microbial attack, and by the alkalinity of the sediments. It is
taphonomically biased in favor of

taxa that resist decay. Charcoal was frequently

observed or recovered in the excavations, but the fragments are so small that taxonomic
identification was rarely possible. Most of the taxa recognized by Dering and Holloway
(oak, cottonwood, willow, pecan, elm, and ?eastern red cedar) are common in the area
today. Isolated grains of pine and sweetgum might represent wider distributions of these
taxa during the Late Pleistocene/early Holocene, or might simply represent long-distance
wind transport. Composites are usually indicators of disturbed habitats, but they also tend
to resist decay better than many other taxa.

The source for large numbers of spores in samples studied by Woosley is
unknown, but the results are not accepted as analytically valid.
