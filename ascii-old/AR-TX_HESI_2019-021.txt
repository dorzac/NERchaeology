MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Between 6 and 8 November 2018, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 kilometers
[km]) of Enterprise Products Partners L.P.’s (Enterprise) proposed Mentone Residue &
Gathering Pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located on public land in western Loving and Ward
counties, Texas (Project Area). The development of the pipeline ROW will be privately funded
and will not require any federal permitting or coordination. However, approximately 3.1 miles
(5.0 km) of the proposed ROW crosses land owned by the University of Texas (UT Land).
Because UT Land is considered public property, the portion of the proposed ROW on UT Land
falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton
Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on
behalf of Enterprise in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if
any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if
the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources survey was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number 8599.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures approximately 49.9 miles (80.3 km) long by
100.0 feet (30.5 meters [m]) wide, with a total area of approximately 604.8 acres. However, the
Project Area (i.e., the segments of the proposed ROW on UT Land) measures only 3.1 miles
(5.0 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 37.6 acres.
Although the permanent ROW will measure no more than 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, Enterprise
requested a 200.0-foot- (61.0-m-) wide Survey Corridor to allow for the avoidance of any cultural
resources that might be encountered during the survey efforts.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in documentation of 2 newly
recorded prehistoric archeological sites, 41LV114 and 41LV115. Both sites consisted of
surficial lithic scatters within the confines of the current Project Area. As their deposits extend
outside of the current Project Area, the full extent of each site was not assessed. As such, they
both retain an undetermined SAL eligibility status. However, based on the surficial nature of
both sites within the Project Area, the portions of each within the current Project Area are
considered to be noncontributing elements to the overall SAL eligibility statuses of each site.

Management Summary

Based on the survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed
Mentone Residue & Gathering pipeline ROW across UT Land will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Enterprise be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT.
All records produced during the investigations have been curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and
Conditions and the Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of
approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 kilometers [km]) of Enterprise Products Partners L.P.’s (Enterprise)
proposed Mentone Residue & Gathering Pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located on public land in
western Loving and Ward counties, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1-1 through 1-9). The
development of the pipeline ROW will be privately funded and will not require any federal
permitting or coordination. However, approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 km) of the proposed ROW
crosses land owned by the University of Texas (UT Land). Because UT Land is considered
public property, the portion of the proposed ROW on UT Land falls under the regulations of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project
Area on behalf of Enterprise in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to
determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered
eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs).
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 49.9 miles (80.3 km) long by 100.0 feet
(30.5 meters [m]) wide, with a total area of approximately 604.8 acres. However, the Project
Area (i.e., the segments of the proposed ROW on UT Land) measures only 3.1 miles (5.0 km)
long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 37.6 acres. In all, there are
a total of 5 segments (UT-1, UT-2, UT-3, UT-4, and UT-5) of varying lengths that make up the
Project Area (see Figures 1-2 through 1-9).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon president) served as the project’s Principal Investigator, while Jacob Lyons
and Foster Duncan (Horizon archeological technicians) conducted the field investigations. The
cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
permit number 8599.

Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area between 6 and 8 November 2018.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the Project
Area. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
wide. Although the permanent ROW will measure no more than 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide,
Enterprise requested a 200.0-foot- (61.0-m-) wide Survey Corridor to allow for the avoidance of
any cultural resources that might be encountered during the survey efforts. This equates to 2
survey transects within a minimum of 32 shovel tests per mile. As the Project Area totals 3.1
miles (5.0 km) in length, a minimum of 100 shovel tests within the 2 survey transects were
necessary in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating
a total of 132 shovel tests within the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in documentation of 2 newly
recorded prehistoric archeological sites, 41LV114 and 41LV115.
Both sites consisted of
surficial lithic scatters within the confines of the current Project Area. As their deposits extend
outside of the current Project Area, the full extent of each site was not assessed. As such, they
both retain an undetermined SAL eligibility status. However, based on the surficial nature of
both sites within the Project Area, the portions of each within the current Project Area are
considered to be noncontributing elements to the overall SAL eligibility statuses of each site.
Based on the survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed
Mentone Residue & Gathering pipeline ROW across UT Land will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Enterprise be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT., it is Horizon’s opinion that the
construction of the proposed Mentone Residue & Gathering Pipeline ROW across UT Land will
have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for

with the construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in
the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
proposed pipeline ROW, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

Enterprise’s proposed Mentone Residue & Gathering Pipeline ROW is located in
western Loving and Ward counties, Texas. It initiates at an existing facility in western Loving
County and extends south and southeasterly to a proposed cryogenic plant several miles north
of Mentone, Texas (see Figures 1-1 through 1-9). From there, the proposed ROW continues to
the southeast to another existing facility east of Barstow, Texas (see Figures 1-1 through 1-9).
It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Kyle Ranch, Lindley Ranch,
Rudd Draw, Mentone, Soda Lake, Quito Draw, and China Lake, Texas topographic quadrangle
maps (see Figures 1-2 through 1-5).
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 49.9 miles (80.3 km) long by 100.0 feet
(30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 604.8 acres. However, the Project Area (i.e.,
the segments of the proposed ROW on UT Land) measures only 3.1 miles (5.0 km) long by
100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 37.6 acres. The 3.1 miles (5.0 km)
of ROW on UT Land consist of 5 separate segments that are broken down as follows:
•

UT-1:

0.6 miles (1.0 km) (see Figures 1-2 and 1-6)

•

UT-2:

1.4 miles (2.3 km) (see Figures 1-2 and 1-6)

•

UT-3:

0.2 miles (0.3 km) (see Figures 1-3 and 1-7)

•

UT-4:

0.2 miles (0.3 km) (see Figures 1-3 and 1-7)

•

UT-5:

0.7 miles (1.1 km) (see Figures 1-4 and 1-8)

•

Total:

3.1 miles (5.0 km)

Representative images of the 5 segments of ROW on UT Land comprising the
Project Area at the time of the cultural resources survey are presented in Figures 2-1 through 25.

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located just north of Pecos in Loving and Ward counties in far West
Texas. It is situated within an area of gently undulating desert hills scattered with playa basins.
Elevations within the Project Area range from 2670.0 to 3100.0 feet (813.8 to 944.9 m) above
mean sea level. Hydrologically, the Project Area is located within the Lower Pecos River
drainage basin. It is drained to the southwest by Rudd Draw and tributaries of the Pecos River.

2.3

CLIMATE

Winters in Loving County are generally cool, with an average temperature of
49.0 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average temperature of
79.0°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 12.4 inches (31.5 centimeters [cm]), with
roughly 70% of it falling between May and October (NRCS 1999).

2.4

SOILS

A total of 3 different soil types are mapped within the boundaries of the 5 segments of
ROW comprising the Project Area. These soils are presented in Table 2-1 (NRCS 1999) and in
Figures 2-6 through 2-9.

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all of
Trans-Pecos Texas except the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950). Blair (1950) notes that area
was once part of an old bolson now drained by the Pecos River. Also located within the
Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion, the Project Area is
situated on geologic formations composed of sand sheet and caliche deposits (Griffith et al.
2007). Three native plant communities dominate the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas: saline
flats and alkaline playa margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland. The dominant species
associated with the saline flats and alkaline playa margins plant community include Atriplex
canescens (fourwing saltbush), Suaeda spp. (seepweed), Salicornia spp. (pickleweed), and
Sporobolus airoides (alkali sacaton). The dominant species associated with the gypsum land
plant community include Bouteloua breviseta (gypsum grama), Mentzelia spp. (blazingstar), and
Ephedra torreyana (Torrey’s jointfir). The dominant species associated with the desert
shrubland plant community include Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), Flourensia cernua
(American tarwort), Yucca spp. (yucca), Artemisia filifolia (sand sagebrush), Vachellia rigidula
(blackbrush acacia), Cylindropuntia leptocaulis (Christmas cactus), Agave lechuguilla
(lechuguilla), and Leucophyllum frutescens (cenizo) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: PaleoIndian (pre-8500 B.P.),
Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic period is
further subdivided into Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), Middle Archaic (6000 to 3500 B.P.),
and Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, including deer and turtles, were also
likely utilized as food items. Plant foods undoubtedly made up a portion of the diet as well.
Based upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as
the low frequency of sites, population densities are hypothesized to have been low and probably
consisted of small family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the
period may suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band
aggregation for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in
upland tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and
Folsom points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the
later span of the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 B.P.)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locations and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence
strategies in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter

climates. Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy,
Hardin, and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC I (1250 TO 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow as
well as ceramics in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continued to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas)
online database indicated the presence of 11 previously recorded archeological sites within a
1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (THC 2018), while a review of the National Park
Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated
the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS
2018). The previously recorded archeological sites and their distances from the nearest
segment comprising the Project Area are summarized in Table 4-1 below. No documented
cultural resources, including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent
to the Project Area.

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research

Based on the Atlas database, portions of the proposed ROW on UT Land are within
areas that were assessed for cultural resources in 2017 for a seismic project. No cultural
resources were documented along the linear seismic survey transects where they overlap the
current ROW. Aside from these seismic survey areas, no other previous cultural resources
surveys have been undertaken along the length of the current overall ROW.

4.2

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lake beds and dune blowouts. Based on the locations of the segments
comprising the Project Area in proximity to several unnamed drainages, in conjunction with the
presence of several previously recorded prehistoric sites within the review perimeter, it was
Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for
undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to
the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangles suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive survey of the
Project Area between 6 and 8 November 2018. This entailed surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing across the 5 segments comprising the Project Area. The TSMASS require a
minimum 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide.
Although the permanent ROW will measure no more than 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, Enterprise
requested a 200.0-foot- (61.0-m-) wide Survey Corridor to allow for the avoidance of any cultural
resources that might be encountered during the survey efforts. This equates to 2 survey
transects within a minimum of 32 shovel tests per mile. As the Project Area totals 3.1 miles (5.0
km) in length, a minimum of 100 shovel tests within the 2 survey transects was necessary in
order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 132
shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch
(6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited
successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, shovel tests, and
cultural material observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were completed for every
shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts
encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site forms were to be
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated
site forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units
utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American
Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figures 5-1 through 5-4.
Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.
All records produced during the investigations are to be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and
Conditions and the Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

6.0 RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 2 new
prehistoric sites within the Project Area. These sites, 41LV114 and 41LV115, are both
prehistoric lithic scatters. Each site is discussed separately below.

6.1

SITE 41LV114

General Description
Site 41LV114 was documented as a low-density, prehistoric lithic scatter observed within
the UT-2 segment of the Project Area (Figures 6-1 and 6-2). It is situated on a relatively flat
desert upland area roughly 16.4 feet (5.0 m) southwest of an existing pipeline corridor
containing 2 colocated pipelines running northwest to southeast.
Vegetation consists of
mesquite, prickly pear, yucca, creosote, pencil cholla, ephedra, short sparse grasses, and other
scrubby brush species (Figure 6-3). Soils present on the site consist of gravelly sandy soils with
high surface visibility (Figure 6-4). Observed cultural materials consists solely of lithic reduction
debris in surface contexts across the site. A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated along the
proposed pipeline centerline and the southwest side of the Survey Corridor. All 10 produced
negative results for subsurface cultural material.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41LV114 consist of a low-density scatter of
aboriginal lithic materials scattered across the surface of the site. Observed materials on site
41LV114 consisted of approximately 15 to 20 secondary and tertiary flakes of chert and rhyolite.
Samples of the observed materials from site 41LV114 are presented in Figures 6-5 and 6-6.
Aside from the lithic materials, no other cultural materials, such as floral and faunal remains,
formal stone tools, or burned rock specimens, were observed on the site. All of the cultural
materials on the site were observed in surface contexts. A total of 10 shovel tests were
excavated over the site, and all 10 produced negative results for subsurface cultural materials
(see Figures 5-2 and 6-2).

Chapter 6.0: Results

Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface on the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 10 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed surface materials, the horizontal extent of site
41LV114 measures approximately 328.1 feet (100.0 m) northwest to southeast by 278.9 feet
(85.0 m) northeast to southwest. Horizon’s investigations were limited to only the portions of the
site within the current Project Area, so the site’s boundaries could extend for an undetermined
distance outside of the current Project Area. As such, the full horizontal extent of site 41LV114
was not assessed.
A total of 10 shovel tests excavated across the site all produced negative results,
indicating that the cultural materials on the site are confined strictly to surface contexts.
Summary
Site 41LV114 was documented as a low-density, aboriginal lithic scatter within an upland
desert setting. Cultural materials on the site consist only of non-diagnostic lithic specimens
restricted to the modern ground surface of the site. The lack of any observed burned rock on
the site may suggest that the site functioned as a source for raw lithic material procurement
rather than a formal campsite. Based upon the lack of temporally diagnostic stone tools,
preserved floral or faunal remains, intact features, and stratified, buried cultural deposits, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site 41LV114 within the current Project Area is a noncontributing element to the SAL eligibility status of the site. As such, no additional cultural
investigations are warranted on the site in connection with the current undertaking.

6.2

SITE 41LV115

General Description
Site 41LV115 was documented as a moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter situated
on a prominent rise to the south of a private oil/gas lease road and west of an active well pad
(Figures 6-7 and 6-8). Vegetation present on the site includes mesquite, prickly pear, creosote,
yucca, pencil cholla, sotol, wild onion, sparse grasses, and other scrubby brush species (Figure
6-9). Soils present consist of shallow rocky sandy loam over caliche bedrock (Figure 6-10).
Exposed gravels on this landform were likely a primary draw of the aboriginal inhabitants of the
area, as they provided an ample source of raw materials for lithic implements. Given the
density of lithic debris over the surface of this site, in conjunction with the lack of any obvious
burned rock or formal tools, it appears to have functioned as a lithic procurement area. A total
of 18 shovel tests were excavated across the site within the confines of the current Project Area,
all of which produced negative results for subsurface cultural deposits. The site extends into an
adjacent pipeline ROW that appears to have been recently surveyed, as surface artifacts
associated with the site within that ROW were marked with pin flags (see Figure 5-3).

Chapter 6.0: Results

Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41LV115 consist of a moderate-density scatter of
aboriginal lithic materials scattered across the surface of the site. Observed materials on site
41LV115 consisted of more than 20 to 30 primary and secondary flakes, 10 to 20 chert cores, at
least 5 tested chert cobbles, and 5 to 10 crude, edge-modified specimens, all derived from the
local Uvalde gravels present on the surface of the site. Representative samples of the observed
materials from site 41LV115 are presented in Figures 6-11 through 6-13. Aside from the lithic
materials, no other cultural materials, such as floral and faunal remains, formal stone tools, or
burned rock specimens, were observed on the site. All of the cultural materials on the site were
observed in surface contexts. A total of 15 shovel tests were excavated over the site, and all 15
produced negative results for subsurface cultural materials (see Figures 5-3 and 6-8).
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface on the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 15 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed surface materials, the horizontal extent of site
41LV115 measures approximately 508.5 feet (155.0 m) north to south by 442.9 feet (135.0 m)
east to west. Horizon’s investigations were limited to only the portions of the site within the
current Project Area, so the site’s boundaries could extend for an undetermined distance
outside of the current Project Area. As such, the full extent of site 41LV115 was not assessed.
A total of 15 shovel tests excavated across the site all produced negative results,
indicating that the cultural materials on the site are confined strictly to surface contexts.
Summary
Site 41LV115 was documented as a moderate-density aboriginal lithic scatter across a
prominent desert rise. It is located south of a private oil/gas lease road and west of an active
well pad. Cultural materials on the site consist only of non-diagnostic lithic specimens restricted
to the modern ground surface of the site. The lack of any observed burned rock on the site,
coupled with the observed core and tested cobble specimens, suggests that the site functioned
as a source for raw lithic material procurement rather than a formal campsite. Based upon the
lack of temporally diagnostic stone tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, intact features, and
stratified, buried cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site 41LV115 within
the current Project Area is a non-contributing element to the SAL eligibility status of the site. As
such, no additional cultural investigations are warranted on the site in connection with the
current undertaking.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

Between 6 and 8 November 2018, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey of approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 km) of Enterprise’s proposed Mentone Residue &
Gathering pipeline ROW located on UT Land in western Loving and Ward counties, Texas. The
development of the pipeline ROW will be privately funded and will not require any federal
permitting or coordination. However, approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 km) of the proposed ROW
crosses land owned by the University of Texas. Because UT Land is public property, the
portion of the proposed ROW on UT Land falls under the regulations of the ACT. At the request
of Whitenton, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of
Enterprise in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the
project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal
designation as SALs. The cultural resources survey was conducted under TAC permit number
8599.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 49.9 miles (80.3 km) long by 100.0 feet
(30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 604.8 acres. However, the Project Area (i.e.,
the segments of the proposed ROW on UT Land) measures only 3.1 miles (5.0 km) long by
100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 37.6 acres.
The survey of the Project Area entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing across the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum 16 shovel tests per
mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. Although the permanent ROW
will measure no more than 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, Enterprise requested a 200.0-foot- (61.0m-) wide Survey Corridor to allow for the avoidance of any cultural resources that might be
encountered during the survey efforts. This equates to 2 survey transects within a minimum of
32 shovel tests per mile. As the Project Area totals 3.1 miles (5.0 km) in length, a minimum of
100 shovel tests within the 2 survey transects were necessary in order to comply with the
TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 132 shovel tests within the
Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in documentation of 2 newly
recorded prehistoric archeological sites, 41LV114 and 41LV115. Both sites consisted of

45

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

surficial lithic scatters within the confines of the current Project Area. As their deposits extend
outside of the current Project Area, the full extent of each site was not assessed. As such, they
both retain an undetermined SAL eligibility status. However, based on the surficial nature of
both sites within the Project Area, the portions of each within the current Project Area are
considered to be noncontributing elements to the overall SAL eligibility statuses of each site.

7.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed
Mentone Residue & Gathering pipeline ROW across UT Land will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Enterprise be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that
any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed pipeline ROW,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
