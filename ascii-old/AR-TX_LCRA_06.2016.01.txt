MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

In June 2010, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) entered into a new memorandum of
understanding (MOU) with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under which LCRA is granted
permission under the Antiquities Code of Texas to conduct cultural resources assessments for LCRA
construction projects. The new MOU replaced a previous memorandum of understanding that the
agencies had entered into in May 2005. The new MOU allows the LCRA archaeology team to conduct
construction monitoring, archaeological surface reconnaissance, and intensive cultural resource surveys
on new and existing tracts, facilities, transmission lines, and substations 300 acres or less in size under
authorization of a yearly blanket Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Antiquities Permit issued for the
calendar year. Projects over 300 acres in size may require a separate permit. Such projects are submitted
to THC through interim reports that THC reviews and comments on during a 30-day review process.
These reports are then finalized and included in the Annual Report.
There are now three notable exceptions to these Standard Review and Reporting Procedures. The first is
for small (less than five acres in size), negative (no archaeological sites present) field surveys. The results
of such projects are summarized in memo form for LCRA project managers and then compiled in the
Annual Report for ex post facto THC review.
The second is for maintenance projects that involve routine and/or periodic potentially ground-disturbing
activities in areas that have been previously disturbed by initial construction or through a history of
similar activities. These are primarily for transmission line rights of way but may also include fence repair
and replacement, prescribed burns, and existing fire lane and road maintenance. Such projects receive at
minimum a file review that evaluates previous levels of investigation and locations of previously
identified sites that are potentially eligible or listed as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). If warranted,
such projects will also undergo field surveys that will typically focus on high-probability areas where
ground disturbance is expected. Recommendations for any site or ground disturbance avoidance areas are
then communicated to LCRA project managers in memo form and likewise compiled in the Annual
Report for after the fact THC review.
The third exception is for projects that occur in previously disturbed areas of existing LCRA-owned lands
and LCRA right of way easements, including (1) electrical substations, (2) power plants, (3) water and
wastewater treatment plants, (4) routine structural maintenance of existing electrical transmission poles
and, (5) pipeline repair or replacement in existing trenches. Under the new MOU, such projects do not
require review by the THC. However, LCRA project managers must coordinate with LCRA
archaeologists early in the planning stage to ensure that no SALs or sites that are eligible (or potentially
eligible) for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are present in the new
construction areas and that the new construction areas have indeed been previously disturbed.
Other projects reviewed by LCRA archaeologists do not require an archaeological survey, typically
because they are in low-probability areas or have been previously evaluated. In such cases, letters are sent
to the THC reviewer explaining the rationale for such recommendations. As with interim reports, THC

reviews and comments on these within a 30-day review period. These letters are also included in the
Annual Report.
From January 1 through December 31, 2016, LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff conducted file
searches, field reconnaissance, intensive survey-level cultural resource investigations, and archaeological
monitoring for 40 projects under Antiquities Permit No. 7531. These were conducted in 21 counties in
central, south-central, western and southeastern Texas (Figure --). All but three were located within the
LCRA Service Area (see Figure --). The 2016 work assessed a total of 4,116 acres of project area for
LCRAâs Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) (1,676 acres), Natural Resource Conservation (NRC)
(1,112 acres), inventory projects (1,274 acres), and miscellaneous projects including park improvements
and monitoring (53 acres). Of these, LCRA staff conducted cultural resources surveys covering a total of
982 acres, which includes 800 acres for TSC, 146 for NRC, and the remainder for parks and other various
projects.
In addition to routine transmission line and parks surveys, LCRA archaeologists completed two major
projects. An inventory was created of artifacts collected over the years during various projects at LCRAâs
Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area (Project No. 17.16). A total of 248 artifacts from 44 archaeological sites
at Muleshoe Bend was curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). The Cultural
Resources staff also conducted extensive monitoring for the NRCâs vegetation management efforts at
seven LCRA properties on Lakes Buchanan and Travis (Project No. 40.16). This consisted of 1) revisits
to define and assess previously recorded archaeological sites for various types of brush clearing, 2)
identifying, flagging and coordinating avoidance measures, and 3) monitoring of the work in particularly
sensitive areas.
Twenty-eight new archaeological sites were recorded as a result of the projects summarized within this
annual report. In total, the new sites are composed of 21 prehistoric components and 10 historic
components. An additional 93 previously recorded sites, comprising 81 prehistoric components and 31
historic components, were assessed in regard to specific projects. Of all 121 assessed sites, 75 were
considered to be ineligible for formal designation as SALs within their project limits, 45 were considered
to be of undetermined eligibility, and one has been determined eligible. It should be emphasized that these
SAL assessments often apply only to the portions of sites that are within LCRA right of way corridors for
electrical transmission lines, pipelines, and boundary fences.With the exception of the Muleshoe Bend
inventory, no artifacts were collected. All original records generated during the cultural resources
investigations will be curated at TARL.
Table 1 presents a list of the sites that were associated with projects in 2016. These sites and their
associated projects from the calendar year are also presented later in the report in
Table 2.

Introduction
From January 1 through December 31, 2016, LCRAâs Archaeology Services staff conducted file searches,
field reconnaissance, intensive survey-level cultural resource investigations, and archaeological
monitoring for 37 projects within LCRAâs traditional statutory district and service area (Figure 1)
reportable to the Texas Historical Commission. Three additional projects were conducted in areas outside
of LCRAâs statutory district and service area. All of these cultural resource investigations were
conducted by LCRA Cultural Resources staff members with the aid of contracted archaeologists, under
the authorization of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7531. Mr. Malof, Mr. Prikryl, and Dr. Smith were
the principal investigators under this permit.

Environmental Background
Introduction
From its headwaters on the Llano Estacado near Lamesa, Texas, the Colorado River flows 864 river miles
to its mouth at Matagorda Bay, a watershed that for millennia has been the major source of water for
Central Texas and portions of the Coastal Plain (Figure 2). It has provided prehistoric and historic Native
Americans as well as historic pioneers with the resources necessary to sustain life. The effects of
environmental change on the river and its resources have a concomitant impact on the people who are
dependent on those resources. Subsequent change can be reflected in the settlement patterns or in the
tools prehistoric people used to process the various food resources. Research of the landscape and cultural
evolution along the river is a goal of LCRA. The information in some areas is more abundant than in
others, the result of differential research. This section provides a brief physiographic background for the
Colorado River within the 11-county LCRA statutory district from San Saba County in the Llano Uplift
Region to Matagorda County on the Gulf Coastal Plain (Figure 1). Subsequent sections focus on the
ancient and modern people who depended on the river for sustenance.
Physiography and Geology
The Colorado River flows in a generally southeasterly direction crosscutting bands of geologic deposits
generally oriented on northeast-southwest lines. Along its course through the LCRA statutory district, it
crosscuts three major physiographic zones: the Llano Uplift, the Hill Country, and the Gulf Coastal Plain
(Sellards et al. 1932: Figures 3 and 4).
The Llano Uplift. As the Colorado River enters San Saba County at the northwest boundary of the LCRA
statutory district, it intersects Paleozoic Era formations of sandstone, limestone, and shale of
Pennsylvanian and Mississippian ages (Arbingast et al. 1976:11). Beginning about midway in the county
and into Burnet and Llano counties, the river traverses billion-year-old Precambrian Era igneous and
metamorphic formations of the Llano Uplift region (Fisher 1981). Granite, schist, and gneiss are a few of
the rocks observed in the region. The Llano Uplift region has very rugged topography with elevations that
range from 1,500 feet above mean sea level (ft amsl) to 825 ft amsl along the river. High points are
Packsaddle Mountain, Backbone Ridge, Long Mountain, and the Riley Mountains. Black (1989:7)
observed that Packsaddle schist and granite were used by prehistoric aboriginal groups in Central Texas.
Grave offerings made from the schist were reported at a cemetery site downstream on the coastal plain in
Austin County along the Brazos River (Hall 1981). Granite cobbles from the river were favored for use as
grinding stones (Johnson 1991) and observed by the authors at sites in the Hill Country and at the
Kingsland site (41BT215). Gravels deposited during Pleistocene floods cover earlier deposits in some
areas along ancient flood terraces. The gravels provided prehistoric people with cobble chert and quartzite
for stone tools.
The Edwards Plateau/Hill Country. Continuing its meandering course, the river traverses Cretaceous
limestone deposits in Burnet and Travis counties (Fisher 1974 and 1981). The area is classified as the Hill
Country, a subprovince of the Edwards Plateau (Woodruff 1975:4). Woodruff (1975:4) describes the area
as â.... an area of high relief, steep slopes, and high stream dissection that occurs between the
3

Figure 2. Major physiographic/natural regions of Texas with locations of counties investigated during 2016

Balcones Escarpment on the east and the contiguous Edwards Plateau farther westâ. Elevations do not
change radically from the preceding reaches. The formations can contain nodular and tabular chert. The
prized chert of the Edwards Limestone formation provided highly workable raw material for the
manufacture of prehistoric chipped stone tools. In addition, the gravels deposited during Pleistocene
floods that mantle earlier deposits in some areas along ancient flood terraces provided prehistoric people
with cobble chert and quartzite for stone tools. The Balcones Escarpment marks the southern boundary of
the Edwards Plateau and the southeastern boundary of the Hill Country.
From this point, the limestone dips southeast and under younger sandstones. From the edge of the
escarpment, the river continues its course onto the geologically younger Gulf Coastal Plain. Given the
resistant nature of the geologic formations in the Hill Country and Llano Uplift regions, it is probable that
the river entrenched early in time, forming steep-sided, narrow canyons in some areas (Looney and Baker
1977:323). This is not the case along the lower channel on the Coastal Plain where the river has
frequently meandered and rechanneled in the less resistant formations.
The Gulf Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie represents the first surface unit traversed by the river at the
interior end of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Situated at the base of the Balcones Escarpment, the Blackland
Prairie is a northeast-southwest trending geographic province (Arbingast et al. 1976:12). The Blackland
Prairie has relatively flat topography, and its surface geology consists of Cretaceous-aged clay and marl.
As the river continues through Bastrop, Fayette, and Colorado counties, it has incised a channel into
Eocene- and Miocene-A age sandstones and clays, leaving behind ancient floodplain terraces (see Caran
et al. 1992). Radiocarbon dating of a volcanic ash zone in one of the older upper floodplain terraces near
the town of Smithville in Bastrop County, indicates terrace development prior to the 620,000 BP (before
present) date (Caran et al. 1992:3-4). The ash is a Middle Pleistocene windblown deposit from volcanoes
in the Yellowstone area. The uplands are hilly in places with gentle slopes. Elevations range from 500 ft
amsl in the uplands to 350 ft amsl along the river banks. Gravel deposits along the river in Bastrop and
Fayette counties are millions of years old. The earlier gravels (i.e., deposited during the late Tertiary
Period) were deposited by large ancient river courses transporting gravels in the channel from as far away
as the Rockies. Now these same erosion-resistant gravels mantle river basin and tributary divides.
Referred to in some areas as Uvalde Gravels (Byrd 1971), they provided prehistoric man with a source of
usable chert and quartzite for chipped stone tools.
The outer bands of the Gulf Coastal Plain in Colorado, Wharton, and Matagorda counties are composed
of relatively flat clayey Pleistocene surfaces of the Beaumont Formation and other fluviatile terraces.
Relief is minimal with elevations ranging from 10-40 feet ft amsl in the uplands to 5-10 feet ft amsl on
the flats near the river channel. Gravel deposits are scarce. Prehistorically, this resulted in an adaptation to
other types of material for tools such as shell and bone. On the outer plain where the Pleistocene
Beaumont clays predominate, a high incidence of megafauna remains (e.g., mammoth, camel, mastodon,
bison, sloth) has been observed and specimens collected from the clays at places such as the mouth of the
Sabine River (Long 1997). Paleoindian artifacts dating to 12,000 years ago have been found on the nearby
beach (Long 1977).

Soils
Except along the Colorado River floodplain where aggrading alluvium has formed terraces, soils along
the river uplands bespeak the underlying strata or parent material. Numerous Soil Conservation Service
soil series describe the consistency of the various soil groups.
In the Llano Uplift area, upland soils can be formed from decomposing granitic and decomposed organic
material (e.g., leaves, bark, berries, cedar duff). The sandy granitic soils contain particles of mica, quartz
and schists (constituents of the granite). At 41BT215 (the Kingsland site), some of the sandy granitic soils
have been redeposited down slope by runoff (colluvial redeposition). Near the base of the slope where the
soils have been redeposited, the river has flooded and deposited sediments. The combination has left
alternating bands of alluvial and colluvial deposits.
In the limestone country of the Hill Country, the soils are deep to shallow and predominantly consist of
stony calcareous clays and clay loams that formed from parent limestone, marl and organic humic
deposits. In some places where erosion has exposed limestone bedrock, the soils are pocketed on
erosional benches. Because these clay and clay loam soils are non-acidic, bone and charcoal are better
preserved in archaeological deposits.
On the Gulf Coastal Plain, topsoils are variable and mimic the underlying geologic formations. Beginning
with the Blackland Prairie on the interior edge of the Gulf Coastal Plain, clay and clay loam topsoils are
derived from the underlying limestone, marl and clay surface geologic formations. Downstream from the
Blackland Prairie, sandy to fine sandy loams occur in areas underlain by various Eocene and Miocene
sandstone bedrock formations. Further southeastward, clay loam and clay topsoils are found adjacent to
the Gulf of Mexico in the Coast Prairies of Wharton and Matagorda counties.
Vegetation
Changes in the vegetation along the Colorado River correspond with changes in soils and bedrock
geology. McMahan et al. (1984) describe the various vegetal classifications. The descriptions presented
by the authors include dominant as well as understory species. To more fully understand the
classifications, two physiognomic classes need definition:
1. Parks - Woody plants mostly equal to or greater than 9-ft tall, generally dominant and growing in
clusters, or as scattered individuals within continuous grass or forbs (11 to 70 percent woody canopy
cover overall).
2. Woods - Woody plants mostly 9-to-30-ft tall with closed crowns or nearly so (71 to 100 percent canopy
cover); midstory usually lacking (McMahan et al. 1984:2).
The Llano Uplift Region is characterized by Live Oak - Mesquite Parks, where overstory species include
post oak, blackjack oak, cedar elm and black hickory. Understory species include buffalo grass, curly
mesquite, little bluestem and Texas winter grass. These species mainly grow in granitic soils.

6

In the Hill Country the vegetation ranges from Live Oak - Ashe Juniper Parks to Live Oak - Mesquite Ashe Juniper Parks, where overstory species include live oak, Texas oak, shin oak, and cedar elm with
understory species such as agarita, flameleaf sumac, Texas pricklypear, little bluestem, Texas winter grass
and curly mesquite. These species are mainly found on level to gently rolling uplands and ridge tops.
Along the edge of the Balcones Escarpment, the vegetation is referred to as Live Oak - Ashe Juniper
Woods. Overstory species are the same as in the preceding categories, with some different understory
species such as evergreen sumac, twistleaf yucca and escarpment cherry. Species are mainly found in
shallow limestone soils in the hills and escarpment.
On the coastal plain, the original vegetation of the Blackland Prairie was bunch and short grasses
(Arbingast et al. 1976:13) with narrow riparian zones restricted to the flanks of stream channels. Much of
the Blackland Prairie was placed into crop production during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a
result, only occasional remnants of the original prairie grasslands have survived. East of the Blackland
Prairie, a Post Oak Woods/Forest with Grassland mosaic is found in the Post Oak Savannah. Overstory in
these areas is post oak, blackjack oak, eastern red cedar, mesquite, black hickory, cedar elm and
hackberry. Understory species include little bluestem, silver bluestem, dewberry and yaupon. Anomalous
to the area are stands of loblolly pine mixed with post oak in Bastrop County. Along the coastal prairies
in Wharton and Matagorda counties, the original vegetation consisted of coarse and coarse bunch grasses
and marsh and salt grasses. The development of croplands in the historic period has altered the vegetation
regime in many parts of this region.

Archaeological Background
Introduction
The portion of LCRAâs 11-county statutory district from its upstream end in San Saba County down into
central Bastrop County falls within a region defined as the Central Texas Culture Area during prehistoric
times (Prewitt 1981). Downstream eastward from the vicinity of Bastrop to Wharton, prehistoric remains
show influences from both Central and Coastal Texas during certain prehistoric periods (Skelton 1977).
At least one attempt to define an East Central Texas prehistoric culture area within the Post Oak
Savannah region has been made (Goode 1984). However, aside from the fact that burned rock midden
sites are restricted to the Hill Country area, prehistoric archeological materials from the Paleoindian and
Archaic periods in East Central Texas and along the coastal portions of the Colorado River drainage are
generally similar to those found in Central Texas Culture Area. For this reason, the prehistoric Culture
History Section that follows heavily utilizes the well-established Central Texas chronology. In the Late
Prehistoric section, however, the cultural remains along the coast are discussed separately from those
inland, as a distinctive Late Prehistoric cultural tradition is evident on the coast from the Bay City area
down to the coastal shoreline (including barrier islands) beginning approximately A. D. 1000. Last of all,
the authors recognize the merits of Ellis et alâs (1995) argument that the traditional Central Texas
prehistoric cultural sequence summary typically presented in archeological reports glosses over the wide
range of environmental diversity and the full range of hunter-gatherer adaptations and processes.
However, it is beyond the scope of this report to adequately detail the full range of such prehistoric
adaptations and cultural processes along the lower Colorado River.

Prehistoric
First evidence of human occupations in Central Texas dates to what is known as the Paleoindian period.
This period is defined as prior to 8500 BP. The Paleoindian period has been divided into two distinct
periods (Collins 1995: 376, Table 2), with the earlier Clovis, Folsom and Plainview cultures present at
11,500 BP. These early people are typically thought to have subsisted on varieties of big game: the Clovis
on mammoth and extinct forms of bison, the Folsom and Plainview on bison. New evidence is suggesting
that this view is in error, and that these people utilized the big game when necessary or advantageous, but
subsisted on a substantial percentage of smaller game as well (Collins 1995:381). This early Paleoindian
period was followed by a Late Paleoindian period, which has subsumed portions of Prewittâs Early
Archaic. For example, the Golondrina style point, placed in the Early Archaic by Prewitt, has been placed
in the late Paleoindian period by Collins (1995:376) based on distinctive features such as edge grinding
and size. Lifeways, however, seem to indicate a more archaic lifestyle (Collins 1995:382). This has been
termed a transitional period, with Paleoindian strategies slowly giving way to broader-based pursuits of
the relatively more sedentary hunter-gatherers of the Archaic (Johnson 1989:52).
The entire Central Texas Archaic spans some 7,500 years, from ca. 8500 BP to around 1250 BP. It can be
characterized generally as a time of increasing human populations adapting within a fluctuating but
generally warming climate. Following Collins (1995) the Early Archaic begins around 8500 BP and lasts
until 6000 BP. The Middle Archaic follows and lasts until around 4000 BP, followed by the Late Archaic
I to 2500 BP, and the Late Archaic II, to about 1200 BP. The Late Prehistoric, or as Johnson now refers to
it, the Post Archaic, follows, and here the phases mentioned earlier seem to hold fairly well, with Austin
Phase peoples around until about 800 BP, when a seemingly true cultural horizon (Johnson 1994), the
Toyah Phase, began.
Foraging cultures are immediately dependent upon natural resources for subsistence. It follows that much
information about lifeways can be gathered if ecological conditions can be ascertained. Collins et al.
(1993) and Johnson (1995) have both examined lines of evidence to suggest warming and cooling trends,
and these are both through the proxy of moisture, as temperature is very difficult to determine. Collins et
al. depend heavily on pollen analysis, which provides information on plant regimes from which climatic
data can be extrapolated. Johnson utilizes various lines of data, including pollen and microfauna from
buried contexts at Halls Cave, and also dated evidence of aggradation or lack thereof of stream side
terraces, with the assumption being that surfaces aggrade (or deflate) during wetter times but remain
stable during drier times. Their interpretations agree very closely for the Middle and Late Archaic, but are
in direct opposition during much of the Early Archaic. Collins is also somewhat more conservative,
avoiding some of the fine-grained peaks and valleys seen in Johnsonâs reconstruction (Collins 1995:Table
2, Johnson 1995:Figure 35).
The Early Archaic was a time when persons had to adapt to the widespread extinction of the large animals
that had existed during the preceding Paleoindian Period. Although the big game hunting nomadic
lifeway has been shown to be largely a stereotype, mobility was probably high and populations relatively
low (Collins 1995:381, Johnson 1989). This basic way of life extended into the first part of the Early
Archaic. Dart points are described as Early Split Stem and include the Gower type first defined at the
8

Youngsport Site (Shafer 1963). Johnson has determined the period was relatively moist (Johnson
1995:Figure 35), while Collins shows it as fairly dry (Collins 1995:Table 2). Both indicate that the
beginning and end of the period were opposite what they showed for the majority, i.e., a peak of either
dryness or wetness at about the middle of the period. Evidence suggests that there were no bison during
this time (Collins 1995:383).
The question of bison presence or absence is very significant for understanding human behavior. Bison,
and to a lesser degree antelope, prefer open grasslands and prairies, and are also social animals, traveling
in large herds. The habits of these large-bodied mammals can be contrasted with the largely solitary
habits of woodland-preferring deer. In most cases bison would be considered to have high return rates,
tempered to some extent by high processing costs. The results would be evident in scheduling, mobility,
and technology of prehistoric people. In general, bison could be expected in tall grass prairies as opposed
to, for instance, oak savannas. Increases in available moisture favors tall grass over short grass, but also
can result in replacement of grasslands by woods. Johnson suggests that bison favored dry conditions in
Central Texas (Johnson 1995:86). Collins indicates bison were present in both wet and dry conditions,
and it is difficult to derive any patterns from his projected data (Collins 1995:Table 2). The strongest
correlation is between moisture-loving microfauna at Halls Cave and a long period of bison presence
through the Late Archaic. At other times bison are seen when all other indicators are of dry conditions.
Perhaps the best explanation comes from Ellis et al.âs (1995) discussion of environmental diversity.
Differential change on a micro- or meso-scale favored bison presence or absence on a scale too finegrained to be reasonably compared with broader climatic shifts.
The Middle Archaic shows climatic conditions of Collins and Johnson coming into fairly close alignment.
Both agree that there was an initial period of fairly mesic conditions followed by a period of drying.
Johnson sees a relatively mild and slow-paced change, while Collins sees an almost catastrophic drought.
Regardless, it is at this time that rock features, designed in the Early Archaic for efficient control of fireproduced heat, expand in function and complexity, coinciding with a spread of xerophytes from the west
due to drying conditions, and resulting in the burned rock middens that begin to be seen (or at least are
more common) during the end of the Middle Archaic (Collins 1995:384, Prewitt 1991:26).
Projectiles in the first part of this period are thin, broad-bladed Bell/Andice/Calf Creek types, deeply
notched points that are believed to have been used both for hunting based on impact breaks, and as
knives, as seen in microwear analysis. This is consistent with a specialized hunting economy, and the
apparent bison presence at that time would be an obvious target of a multipurpose projectile/knife
(Collins 1995:384). The disappearance of bison coincides with the replacement of these types with
narrow, thick, heavy Travis and Nolan points. Johnson sees precursors of the bison tool assemblage
coming in from the Plains, and precursors of these latter points perhaps from the Lower Pecos, in the form
of Pandale points (Johnson 1995:88). This is suggestive, as the Plains would of course have had bison,
while they were largely absent in the Lower Pecos. Perhaps the new style was more efficient for the
newly high-ranked deer, which would surely have replaced bison as the preferred meat source. Toolkits in
general became more diverse, as diet breadth widened and generalization became necessary in order to
effectively intensify the use and processing of lower ranked food sources (Prewitt 1981:73).

9

The Late Archaic, as noted earlier, is divided into subperiods I and II. The first portion saw a continuation
of the dry period initiated earlier, and burned rock midden accumulations peaked at this time. The
Bulverde point, although in some respects similar in form to Travis/Nolan points, is seen, at least by
Johnson, to be a distinct technological break, and again to have apparent influences from the northeast
and Plains regions (Johnson 1995:89-90). It is this break, combined with a continuity seen in succeeding
Pedernales types as well as the extent of burned rock midden accumulations, that has resulted in this
major reordering of this portion of the Archaic.
Also appearing about this time was the Marcos-style point, another broad-bladed point with deep corner
or side notching, similar in some respects to the Pedernales, at least in width of blade. It is at this time that
Late Archaic I shifts to Late Archaic II, and the climate seems to become much moister. Apparently bison
are present throughout most of the Late Archaic, even as narrow-bladed Ensor/Fairland points begin
replacing the broader Marcos/Williams/Marshalls.
One interesting way of explaining this seeming discrepancy would be by having these latter points hafted
on arrows (Tomka 1998), with an underlying (but wholly subjective) assumption that darts did not have
enough penetrating power for bison, and so the emphasis was on a wide blade causing extensive
hemorrhaging. The penetration of darts was perhaps sufficient for deer if a narrower blade was used. A
narrow blade propelled by a bow, however, might have enough penetration to effectively kill a bison.
Regardless, increased moisture saw a retreat of the xerophytes, and a corresponding decrease in the
construction of burned rock middens, especially in the eastern portion of Central Texas.
There is also evidence of increasing populations, and processing of plants other than xerophytes is evident
based on an increase in numbers of groundstone from these components (Collins 1995:385). It is not clear
what was being so extensively processed with these implements. Acorns and grass seeds are two
possibilities. Cemeteries became more widespread, as does evidence of internecine warfare (Hall
1981:iii). Combined, these would suggest an attachment to land and protection of resources, and also a
certain increase in environmental stress or resource depletion. As well, Johnson sees general technologies
arriving from the plains, while social variables seem to be influenced from Woodland cultures to the east
and northeast (Johnson 1995:96, 97). In short, it seems to be a time of rapid changes in social complexity
with resource intensification and a broadening of the diet base, most likely as a response to the demands
of increasingly large human populations.
The Late Prehistoric Period seems to be a continuation of Late Archaic lifeways up until Toyah times
when bison reappeared, as did a more nomadic life as well as technologies (blades and specialized
scrapers) not seen since Paleoindian times. The Late Prehistoric Period has been subdivided into two
distinct intervals by Collins (1995: 385), which correspond to Prewittâs Neo-Archaic Austin and Toyah
Phases. The early Late Prehistoric, or Austin Phase, shows a distinct trend toward arrow points, but the
Archaic lifeways seem to persist. The Late Prehistoric corresponds to the Toyah Phase, and cultural
remains indicate a shift back toward a hunting subsistence base. Bison apparently became common once
more in Central Texas (Collins 1995:377, Table 2; Prewitt, 1981:84), and prehistoric peoples evidently
took full advantage of that resource. This period, of course, came to its conclusion shortly after the arrival
of Europeans to Texas in the early 16th century, marking the beginning of the Historic Period.

10

In the coastal region of the Colorado River drainage, Ricklis (1995) has proposed that the Late Prehistoric
extends from about A.D. 1000 to about A.D. 1700. During that era, the material assemblage includes
pottery with types identified as sandy paste Goose Creek variations and Rockport Black-on-Gray
variations some with asphaltum decorations. During the Historic period and quite probably during the
later part of the Late Prehistoric, Karankawan groups occupied the central coast. Archaeological data
suggest that the Karankawa spent the fall and winter along the coastline in large encampments (Ricklis
1996:101). Fishing and collection of shellfish were the principal economic pursuits at these sites. In the
early spring, and continuing through the summer, the Karankawa moved inland to smaller camps along
the rivers and creeks that empty into the coastal bays. The collection of wild plant foods and hunting of
deer and bison were important pursuits during that portion of the year.
Historic (200 BP - recent times)
Native American. The Historic Period begins at the time of European contact, ca A.D. 1500, although
along the Colorado River little direct interaction between Native Americans and Europeans occurred for
as much as 200 years after this time. Evidence of the early part of this period in terms of archaeological
materials is generally quite rare and minimal. While the descendants of the Late Prehistoric in the vicinity
of the mouth of the Colorado River appear to be the historic Karankawa (Ricklis 1995), the cultural
evolution of descendants of the Toyah Phase peoples is not well understood in the Central Texas region.
For example, Campbell (1988:73) cautiously names at least 60 historic Indian groups associated with the
Bastrop County area. Of these, only a portion could be considered native to the area. The Tonkawa,
generally believed by the public to be the single indigenous "tribe" of Central Texas, were immigrants
probably from what is now Oklahoma (Campbell 1988:75). Further westward in the Hill Country, the
Apache and Comanche were present during the Historic Period. Aggressive European settlement across
eastern and coastal Texas just into the fringes of the Hill Country destroyed most of the native population
prior to their removal to reservations.
Euro-American. In the early 1530s, Cabeza de Vaca became the first known European to transverse the
lower Colorado River (Hester 1999). Members of La Salleâs expedition and a number of early Spanish
explorers and missionaries crossed the Colorado in the late seventeenth century, but it was not until the
early eighteenth century that Europeans are known to have stayed for any length of time on the river
(Baumgartner et al. 1997:17-26). In 1709, for example, the Spanish explorers of the Espinosa-Aguirre
Expedition stopped along the river in the vicinity of Wilbarger Creek between present-day Austin and
Bastrop (Campbell 1983).
There are no records of any Spanish missions being constructed on the Colorado River, and actual
Spanish settlement on the Colorado River did not occur until relatively late. In 1805, Manuel Bustamante
ordered Spanish troops to be stationed at the El Camino Real crossing of the Colorado at present-day
Bastrop, where a stockade was built and named Puesta del Colorado (Webb 1952, Vol. 2:120). It was not
until 1829 that permanent settlement began at Bastrop (formerly called Mina) with the arrival of settlers
associated with Stephen F. Austinâs third grant that was also known as the âLittle Colony.â
Shortly before his death in 1821, Moses Austin had obtained from Spain the first land grant to introduce
American families into Texas. By the time the Congress of Mexico reaffirmed conditions of this grant to
11

his son, Stephen F. Austin, in 1823, settlement of the âOld Three Hundredâ families on the lower Brazos
and Colorado rivers was well under way. On the Colorado River drainage, the grant allowed Anglo
settlement from the coast all the way up to the vicinity of present-day La Grange in Fayette County.
Typical of early Anglo settlement on the Colorado River was Beasonâs Crossing near the present-day
town of Columbus (Webb 1952:378). Among the early colonists at this settlement was Jesse Burnam,
who was able to raise enough able-bodied men in the Beasonâs Crossing area in 1822 to march down to
the mouth of the Colorado to check on the robbery of a sailing vessel (Webb 1952:378). Downstream in
present-day Wharton County, 25 of the âOld Three Hundredâ families received title to land in that county
in 1823 and 1824. Early settlement there centered around a trading post called Preston, which was located
on the east bank of the river about 10 miles south of the current town of Wharton (Webb 1952:890). By
the early 1830s, the western edge of the frontier had extended into eastern Travis County with a chain of
small family forts located at Webberâs Prairie, Coleman Branch, and Fort Prairie (Webb 1952:796).
Numerous men from the Colorado River settlements participated in the Texas Revolution. However, none
of the major battles occurred on the Colorado River. Beasonâs Crossing figured prominently, though, in
the Runaway Scrape, as many Texans crossed the Colorado at that location. After their safe passage,
Houston ordered the town of Columbus burned (Webb 1952:379).
Following the Texas Revolution, the community of Waterloo in central Travis County was selected as the
capital and renamed Austin in 1839. Settlements on the Colorado River below Austin continued to grow
as more settlers arrived in the years leading up to the Civil War. In counties on the coastal plain,
plantation-style agriculture was practiced by the wealthier landowners. While the majority of the settlers
were originally from the southern United States, German immigrants began entering the Biegelâs
Settlement area in Fayette County in the 1830s (Carter and Ragsdale 1976). After the Civil War, many
former plantation owners in Fayette, Colorado, and Wharton counties sold their lands in small parcels to
other German and Czech immigrants. They, along with former Black slaves, usually worked the land as
tenant farmers before accumulating enough money to purchase land. Cotton, corn and sorghum were the
staple crops well into the mid-twentieth century.
Prior to the Civil War, Anglo settlement had spread up the Colorado River into through western Travis,
Burnet and San Saba counties. Fort Croghan was established at the future townsite of Burnet in 1849
(Webb 1952:253). Among the earliest settlers in this region were a group of Mormons who operated a
mill. Noah Smithwick, a well-known early settler in Bastrop County, bought the Mormonsâ mill in 1854
when he moved upstream to Burnet County. Several years later he built a new mill at a new site on the
nearby Colorado River (Smithwick 1983). Settlement along the middle Colorado was well-established by
the mid-1850s (Malof 2008).
Archival and oral historical research has been undertaken in recent years on a number of the early
communities in the present Lake Travis area in Travis and Burnet counties (Utley 1994 and 1996). In this
research, Utley (1996:9-10) notes that the Texas Hill Country lies west of the 98th meridian, Webbâs
(1931:8-9) dividing line between forested areas of the eastern United States and the Great Plains.
Following Webbâs thesis concerning how this dividing line affected the way of life of early settlers, Utley

12

shows how early attempts at cotton farming in the rocky soils frequently failed. As a result, most settlers
adapted to ranching and other economic pursuits.
The construction of a chain of four lakes by the newly formed LCRA in the late 1930s and early 1940s
dramatically changed the landscape and the small communities along the Colorado River in western
Travis, Burnet and Llano counties. The former emphasis on ranching has given way to the development
of lakefront subdivisions and tourism associated with the lakes.

Results of Investigations
During calendar year 2016, the LCRAâs Archaeology Services staff conducted in-house cultural resource
investigations for projects reportable under TAC Permit 7531. Table 2 provides a listing of the project
names, project numbers, interim report numbers (if necessary), dates of investigations and THC
concurrence (when applicable) and the construction status of each project. This table also gives data on
archeological sites that were recorded or revisited during each project, the SAL status of each
archeological site, the amount of acreage involved in each project area, and the county in which each
project is situated.
All but six projects completed during 2016 took place within LCRAâs statutory district and service area.
The work was conducted for projects related to development and inventory of parks and preserves, new
electrical substation construction, upgrades and overhauls of existing electrical transmission lines and
maintenance of LCRAâs irrigation system.

Part I. Full Reports of Survey Investigations
During calendar year 2016 there were 13 projects that required immediate reporting to the THC. These
were for survey projects that were larger than 5 acres in size and/or contained cultural resource sites that
might be impacted by a particular project. These projects included three electrical substation projects,
seven transmission lines, one park improvement project, one major LCRA lands inventory project, and
one report of vegetation management at the Lake Fayette properties. All of these projects were reviewed
by the THC, and in each case the THC concurred with LCRA Cultural Resource staff recommendations.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The LCRA is proposing to upgrade the 15.72 mile long existing T-538 electrical transmission line from
the Deer Creek substation to the Luling substation in Guadalupe and Caldwell Counties (Figure 4-Figure
8). This project, LCRA Project 1.16, begins where LCRAâs Nixon-to-Deer Creek T-605 Transmission
Line Upgrade Project ended, which is reported as LCRA Project 2.15 in the LCRA Annual Report of
Cultural Resource Investigations for 2015 (Hanson 2015). This line was originally constructed between
the 1920s and 1960s by a private power distribution company and was purchased by the LCRA in 2009.
Due to the age of this line, the width of the ROW corridor is highly variable. In some areas, there is no
actual corridor other than the centerline that was acquired for placement of the poles. In other areas, the
ROW varies from 30 to 60 feet in width. For the purposes of this survey, an average ROW corridor width
of 60 feet (15 meters) was decided upon. As in LCRA Project 2.15, the current wooden single-pole and
H-frame transmission line structures will be removed and new steel or cement single-pole structures will
be constructed in new locations, and at a greater distance from each other than the current structures.
No previous surveys associated with this transmission line have been conducted because the line was
privately owned and, for the most part, constructed prior to legislation requiring protection of
archaeological and historic sites. Additionally, during the LCRAâs ownership of the T-538 transmission
line, no ground disturbing projects have been undertaken, until now. The current survey was required due
to the construction of new structures at new locations. The LCRA Cultural Resources team conducted
intensive investigations during the period from January through March 2016, following Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) standards, as described below in Methodology. In the course of the project, 7.39
miles of high probability areas were surveyed. Of the surveyed area, 5.68 miles were subjected to
subsurface testing and 1.71 miles were not subjected to subsurface testing, as ground visibility was
greater than 30 percent and Holocene age deposits were visibly eroded away. The cultural resources
investigations were undertaken under TAC permit 7531. There is no current or anticipated federal funding
or permitting associated with this project. No artifacts were collected during the project; project records
will be submitted to an accredited curation facility.
Only one previously recorded archaeological site exists within the T-538 transmission line ROW corridor.
This site, 41CW28, also known as Zedlerâs Mill, is a late nineteenth century mill, which has been
renovated and repurposed into a Luling city park and event center. Investigations at this site are described
below in Previous Investigations. As a result of the current survey, seven new archaeological sites were
recorded, including: four prehistoric sites (41GU184-186 and 41GU188), two historic sites (41GU187
and 41CW170) and one multi-component site (41GU183). The portions of all newly recorded sites within
the transmission line corridor are assessed as not eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL). Similarly, the small portion of previously recorded site 41CW28 that will be affected
by the project is assessed as not SAL eligible. No special considerations or avoidance measures are
recommended for this project. Standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place, and LCRA
Cultural Resources staff recommends the project proceed.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

Moving from the south end of the project area generally northeastward to the northern end at Luling,
Texas, the surface geology of the project area consists of the Eocene-era Wilcox group, the Pleistoceneera Willis Formation, and Holocene alluvium on the San Marcos River floodplain just south of the City of
Luling, Texas (Barnes 1974). The Wilcox Group mostly consists of mudstone with sandstone, lignite,
and ironstone concretions, while the Willis Formation consists of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. Holocene
alluvial deposits on the San Marcos River probably contain clay, silt, sand and gravel. The total depth of
this alluvium is unknown.
The characteristics of soils mapped along the transmission line corridor according to the Guadalupe
County soil survey (Ramsey and Bade 1977) and the Caldwell County soil survey (Lowther and Werchan
1978) are summarized in Table 3.

The area is classified as part of a post oak woods, forest and grassland mosaic (McMahan1984), and in
prehistoric times the project area would have been an oak savanna with mottes of post oak present with
mixed grass prairies. The main vegetation at the project area currently is grasses, forbs, prickly pear and
mesquite.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
LCRAâs T-538 electrical transmission line, originally running 34 miles from Nixon to Luling, was
constructed before legislation requiring survey to determine potential impacts to archaeological resources
was enacted. As such, the ROW corridor has never been completely surveyed. As part of a 2014 upgrade
plan, the line was split into two, with the line south of alternate US Highway 90 (ALT-90) becoming T605 and the line north of ALT-90 remaining T-538. LCRAâs Cultural Resources team surveyed the 18
mile length of T-605 in 2015, and the remaining 16 miles of T-538 will be surveyed completely for the
first time during this 2016 project.
The only previously recorded site along the T-538 ROW is site 41CW28, the historic Zedlerâs Mill site.
This site, on the southern edge of Luling, consists of a dam across the San Marcos River and a mill and
several related buildings, constructed in 1874. The mill was converted to provide water and electricity to
Luling and was in operation until 1960. The buildings have since been renovated and converted into a
community park and event center. The site was first recorded in 1982 by Nancy Kenmotsu (THC Site
Atlas). In 2008, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology (TAA) investigated the 9.4 acre area to be turned into
Zedler Mill Park. TAA conducted a 100 percent surface survey, and excavated 10 shovel tests and 10
backhoe trenches and discovered no significant subsurface deposits (Nickels 2008). In 2013, Prewitt &
Associates (Burden 2013) investigated an area of the streambank alluvial terrace, 441 ft long by 30 ft
wide, above the historic millrace for a bank stabilization project. Prewitt & Associates excavated six
trenches in the southern half of the terrace and the material recovered in the two positive tests came from
between 60-100 cm bs and was no older than 60 years. The northern half of the terrace was deemed
29

unlikely to have supported human habitation based on the topography and was heavily disturbed by
previous construction. The SAL status and the NRHP status of site 41CW28 remains undetermined as of
2010.
The only other investigation within the 2016 project area on the T-538 ROW was a survey conducted by
LCRA Cultural Resources staff in 2013 for the Deer Creek substation project (Hixson et al 2013). In the
originally proposed location, LCRA Cultural Resources staff found a small amount of prehistoric lithic
material in two shovel tests in the southeast project area at the T-538 ROW. The substation location was
moved farther south, closer to ALT-90, however, and no material was found during survey of this new
area.
In early 2015, LCRA Cultural Resources staff surveyed the 18 mile length of the T-605 ROW corridor
from south of ALT-90 to the Nixon substation (Hanson 2015). Only three new sites, 41GU170,
41GU171, and 41GU172, were found in the ROW corridor during this project, all of which were within 3
kilometers of the south bank of the Guadalupe River. The northernmost site, 41GU170, is roughly 2 km
south of the Deer Creek substation. All three sites are open campsites and the artifacts recorded at these
sites included debitage, some burned rock, a biface and one possible hearth. All three sites were
recommended to be ineligible for SAL status within the ROW.
The largest nearby cultural resource survey project is the Post Oak Clean Green Project that was surveyed
by SWCA in 2011 (Stotts 2011). Eight cultural resource sites consisting of 41GU135-139 and 41GU147149 were recorded and assessed during that project. These sites consist of four prehistoric lithic scatters,
one prehistoric campsite and two historic twentieth century former rural residential sites, and one
twentieth century historic period brick scatter site of undetermined function. Several of the prehistoric
sites had no surface manifestations with shallowly buried lithic debris mostly being found in the upper 30
to 55 cm of sandy topsoil deposits. The only prehistoric diagnostic artifact found was a Martindale point
at site 41GU149. All eight of the sites were assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP).
Elsewhere, prehistoric site 41GU63 was found during a survey for a proposed rest area facility on
Interstate Highway 10 north of the project area. This prehistoric campsite is noteworthy for its large size
as it extends for a length of 1,150 meters along the highway right-of-way near Nash Creek. Multiple
positive shovel tests in soil deposits greater than 30 cm thick led to a recommendation for test
excavations. The portion of the site within the highway ROW was later determined to not be SAL or
NRHP eligible (Barile and Houk 2000).
Finally, SWCA conducted archaeological investigations in 2004 for the GBRAâs Luling to Lockhart
water transmission line (Lawrence 2004). The line begins at a water treatment plant on the San Marcos
River just a few hundred meters upstream from site 41CW28 and provides water to Lockhart, some 15
miles north. No sites were recorded during this project.

Prehistoric Background
The project area is located at the border between the northeastern edge of the
South Texas archeological region and the southwestern edge of the Central Texas
archeological region, as summarized by Perttula (2013). Ellis et al. (1995) note
the inaccurate homogenization that occurs when writing about areas as
ecologically diverse as central or south Texas. Indeed, at various times the Central
and South Texas archaeological regions share diagnostic artifacts with their
neighboring regions. The prehistory of the South Texas region is not as clearly
delineated as the more intensely studied Central Texas region, but both follow the
same general chronological patterns (Figure 9). This report uses the basic
chronological divisions for Central Texas used by Collins (2004), which consist
of the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods.
The Paleoindian period (ca. 11,200-8800 BP) is commonly thought of as a period
of terminal Pleistocene hunters of big game, such as mammoth and bison, and is
recognizable by several point types, such as Clovis and Folsom. The people of
the Paleoindian period, however, subsisted on a wide variety of plants and
animals, at various times in various places (Collins 2004). Paleoindian sites near
the project area are Pavo Real to the west, and Wilson-Leonard and Gault to the
northwest.
The Archaic (ca. 8800-1200 BP) is the longest period in Texas prehistory and is
generally a period of increasing variety and specialization of tools and technology
and hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies (Collins 2004). The defining feature,
arguably, of the Archaic is the presence of heated rock features, likely a result of
food intensification in the form of earth ovens. The Archaic is subdivided into the
Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods. In the Central Texas and South Texas
regions these sub-periods differ slightly in commencement and duration (Figure
9) but otherwise conform to the general pattern.
Figure 9: Chronologies
for the Central Texas
and South Texas
archaeological regions.
Perttula 2013.

The Late Prehistoric (ca. 1200-500 BP) is characterized by the introduction of the
bow and arrow and, later, pottery. Despite these technologies, adopted at various
times in various places, the subsistence strategies of hunter-gatherers in the area
remained generally similar to those of the Archaic for the early part of the Late
Prehistoric. The archaeological record of the later part of the Late Prehistoric is dominated across large
parts of Texas by the Toyah toolkit, specialized for bison and deer hunting (Collins 2004). The Late
Prehistoric ended with the arrival of Europeans in North America.

Historic Background

The history of the area, through which LCRAâs T-538 electrical transmission line runs, goes back to the
beginnings of major Texas settlement in the early to mid-nineteenth century. The area was at the center of
the Texas Revolution in 1836 but faded in prominence during the latter half of the century. In the
twentieth century oil played a significant role in the area. The majority of the following discussion is
summarized from the Handbook of Texas Online.
Major settlement in the area began with the formation of DeWittâs colony. Two Americans, Green
DeWitt and James Kerr, were inspired by Stephen F. Austinâs success to form their own colony in
Mexican Texas in 1825 (Roell 2010). Dewittâs colony was formed adjacent to and southwest of Austinâs
colony and, by agreement with the Mexican government, was required to settle 400 families by 1831. The
capital of DeWittâs colony was Gonzales, which was established at the confluence of the Guadalupe and
San Marcos rivers in 1825. Attacks by local Native American groups prompted settlers to flee back to the
coast. A fort was constructed in1827, allowing some settlers to return. Due to various factors, including
attacks by Native American groups and disputes with the Mexican authorities, DeWitt failed to settle the
400 families and all vacant land reverted to Mexican government control. The more than 120 families
who had settled in DeWittâs colony finally received titles to their land from the Mexican government after
surveys were completed in 1831-1832. The attempt by Mexican authorities in late 1835 to remove a
cannon from Gonzales, originally given to the town in 1831 to ward off Native American attacks, sparked
the Texas war for independence.
After the establishment of the Republic of Texas in 1836, the area was formed into Guadalupe and
Caldwell counties. The southern majority of LCRAâs T-538 line lies in Guadalupe County. To the south
of the Deer Creek substation, where the 2016 project begins, lie the Capote Hills, which was one of the
first land grants awarded by the Spanish government in the area to JosÃ© de la Baume in 1806, though the
events of the Mexican Revolution meant he did not receive clear title to it until 1832. Besides the families
settled prior to 1831 in DeWittâs colony, 14 other families received land grants directly from the Mexican
government by 1835. Most settlers were from the southern United States and many had land along Mill,
Nash, and Darst creeks, the two former being the major creeks along the T-538 transmission line. Darst
Creek was named after Jacob Darst (Texas State Historical Association [TSHA] 2010a, Groneman 2010),
a local settler who was one of the defenders of the Gonzales cannon in 1835 and who died at the Battle of
the Alamo in 1836. Another Texas Revolutionary and signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence,
Claiborne West, had a home from 1850 until his death in 1866 very near where the Deer Creek substation
now sits. Most early settlers here maintained land claims in the area but remained in Gonzales for
protection from Native American attack and during the Runaway Scrape of 1836. The settlers were able
to safely occupy their lands after troops of the Texas Republic were stationed in the area for protection.
Many German settlers also passed through the area on their way to the Hill Country farther west. As
many of the settlers in the area were from the southern United States, some brought slaves with them to
Texas. In 1850 slaves comprised roughly one third of the county population and by 1860 were nearly half
the population (Smyrl 2010b). The majority of slaveholders were small farmers. Of the 202 slaveholders
recorded in the 1860 census 71 percent owned less than 10 slaves, 27 percent owned 10-40 slaves, and 2
percent (only 3 slaveholders) owned more than 40 (Smyrl 2010b). After the Civil War, many AfricanAmericans organized into communities known as âblack coloniesâ along the Guadalupe River and along
Darst and Nash creeks. The economy of the black colonies depended on agriculture and livestock and
community members valued land accumulation and education for advancement (Limmer 2012c). The
32

countyâs black population peaked at 34 percent in 1870 and by 1980 was only 6 percent of the total
(Smyrl 2010b).
Seguin is the Guadalupe County seat and the largest nearby city, with a population of 22,000 (Gesick
2010). The first recorded exploration of the area occurred in 1718 when Governor MartÃ­n de AlarcÃ³n
established Presidio San Antonio de BÃ©xar. The townsite was laid out in 1838 and named Walnut Springs,
then renamed Seguin in 1839 to honor Texas Revolutionary Juan SeguÃ­n. The town was an early trading
hub, as it lay on the road to San Antonio and on the road German settlers took from Indianola to the Hill
Country. Otherwise the economy has been largely based on agriculture, though it benefitted from the
discovery of oil nearby in the 1920s.

Figure 10: Gregorio Cortez Lira, seated center, with his guards.
Other Guadalupe County towns nearby include Kingsbury and Belmont. Kingsbury (Smyrl 2010c) is a
small town half way between Luling and Seguin with a modern population of 652, which was established
when the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railroad was built nearby in 1875. The town was
named in 1876 for William G. Kingsbury (1823-1896). Kingsbury (Pease 2010) was a dentist from New
York who moved to Texas in 1846. Kingsbury was notable for his writings about Texas, which inspired
thousands of immigrants, mostly English, to move to Texas and which led him to be appointed Texas
Commissioner of Immigration. In 1876, he was a representative for several American railroads in Europe
and was based in London. The town of Kingsbury remained small and the economy was based on cotton
and, beginning in the 1920s, oil.
The other nearby community is Belmont (Hardin 2010), located 10 miles south of Luling and 16 miles
east of Seguin. Originally established as a stage stop in the 1840s and known as Centerville, the town,
when it applied for a post office, changed its name to Belmont, supposedly after the family famous for
33

horse racing. The population peaked in 1896 at 125 before declining to 60 for most of the twentieth
century. Belmont gained some mild notoriety in 1901 as the site of a shootout between Tejano fugitive
Gregorio Cortez Lira (Orozco 2010) and local law enforcement. Cortez (Figure 10) shot and killed the
Karnes County sheriff when, during the course of an investigation into a horse theft, a series of
mistranslations led to a gunfight in which the sheriff shot Cortezâ brother, Romaldo. Cortez fled and took
refuge at the Robledo ranch in Belmont, where a posse including the Gonzales County sheriff caught up
with him. In the ensuing gun battle the Gonzales County sheriff was killed and Cortez escaped again. In
all, the manhunt lasted ten days and involved hundreds of people. During this time, racial tensions
between Tejanos and Anglos boiled over and led to the deaths, injuring, and arrests of numerous Tejanos
in the surrounding counties. The event inspired the ballad, El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, as early as
1901 and a movie, The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez, in 1982. The community of Belmont remains less
famous, and exists now mostly as a gathering spot for local farmers (Hardin 2010).
North of Guadalupe County sits Caldwell County, which contains about 3 miles of the 15 mile long T538 transmission line, all of which is in the town of Luling. Caldwell County was also originally part of
DeWittâs colony and early settlement occurred along the San Marcos River and Plum Creek (Smyrl
2010a). Initial settlers were occasionally involved in violent encounters with Native American groups,
especially the Comanche, but these encounters all but ceased after the 1840 Battle of Plum Creek near
Lockhart drove Indian groups north and west. The 1850 population was about 1,055 free residents and
274 slaves (26 percent) and the 1860 population was 2,871 free residents and 1610 slaves (56 percent).
During the Civil War, the county voted for Secession and many served in the Confederate army. During
Reconstruction racial violence led to Federal troops being stationed in the county. Most of the black
populace stayed where they lived and only one independent black community was founded. In the late
nineteenth century the cattle industry grew as did transportation of cattle and goods. At the turn of the
century, cotton began to supplant cattle as the economic driver but diminishing returns on land yields led
farmers to diversify by the 1930s. Also at the turn of the century the Hispanic population increased as
Mexican immigrants arrived to work as tenant farmers or as farm labor. Though oil mitigated the effects
in some areas, the Great Depression brought population loss and changes. Trends during this time were
from small family farms to large ranches and farms, from cotton to pastureland and food crops, and a
decline from tenant farming as a percentage of farms, from a high of 75 percent to 20 percent by 1960. By
2000, 50 percent of the population worked outside of the county, mostly in nearby San Marcos and
Austin.
At the far southern border of Caldwell County, on the north bank of the San Marcos River, sits the town
of Luling. Luling (Smyrl 2010d) began in 1874 as a railway terminus of the Galveston, Harrisburg and
San Antonio railway located 3 miles west of Plum Creek. The origin of the name is unclear but the three
main stories are that it was named after a Chinese rail worker, after a Judge Luling, or it was the railroad
builderâs wifeâs maiden name. Major shipments on the railroad included cotton products, livestock, and
pecans. One prominent feature which lies within the project area is Zedlerâs Mill (site 41CW28), which
was built in 1874 and bought by Fritz Zedler in 1880. Zedler (Smyrl 2010e) was born in 1840 in Prussia
and his family immigrated to Texas in 1852. Before becoming a miller, Zedler worked variously as a mail
carrier, cattle drover, and owner of a freight service. Zedler served in the Confederate army for a time
before marrying and moving to Mexico. By 1880, Zedler was back in Texas and had taken ownership of
the failing mill on the San Marcos River in Luling. In 1890, the town of Luling was using Zedlerâs mill
34

pond as its local water source. In 1894, Zedlerâs sons installed an electric plant in the mill and began
providing electricity to Luling. Fritz Zedler died in 1932 and the powerplant was in operation until 1960.
Zedlerâs mill is now a Luling City Park. In 1890, another railroad, the San Antonio and Aransas Pass, was
built but Luling remained unremarkable until the Luling oil field was discovered in 1922.
The Luling Oil Field was discovered by Edgar B.
Davis (1873-1951). Davis (TSHA 2010b) was born
in New York and had already made two fortunes in
a shoe factory and investing in overseas rubber
plantations before he retired. In 1919, his brother,
Oscar, asked Davis to leave retirement and manage
Oscarâs oil leases in Caldwell County, where,
despite a speckling of exploration, no major
oilfields were known or expected to exist. In 1922,
near Stairtown, just north of Luling, Davis
discovered the 12 mile by 2 mile Luling oil field.
Oil production in the area peaked in 1924 at 11.1
million barrels. By 1935 production averaged 2.5
million barrels annually and by the 1980s averaged
1-2 million barrels annually. Davis sold his oil
leases for $12 million (approximately equivalent to
$163.7 million in 2016) and threw a barbecue for
the entire town and gave his employees bonuses
ranging from 25 to 100 percent of their salaries.
Davis was also a great philanthropist and gave
away most of his fortunes to charity. He established
a golf course in Luling, funded athletic facilities for
the African-American population of Luling and
created the Luling Foundation to advance

Luling Watermelon Thump has drawn as many as
40,000 visitors and agriculture remains important to the town. After the Luling oil field, Davis proceeded
to discover the nearby Buckeye and Darst Oil Fields. Despite his success and philanthropy, Davisâ
company eventually folded and Davis died in 1951, having nearly paid back all the debts he had incurred.
His grave is at his homesite, now the grounds of the local hospital named for him.
The Darst Oil Field (Figure 11) lies generally to the south and east of LCRAâs T-538 transmission line
but crosses it in some places. In the 1930s, this oil field was bustling with derricks and workers. The
workers lived on the oil fields in camps with their families. The families lived in houses with large fenced
yards and the children played among the derricks and slush pits (Limmer 2012b). The families took pride
in their community and kept the land groomed, even whitewashing the trees, and some kept livestock on
the land. Kids frequented a swimming hole on Nash Creek and families went into Kingsbury, Luling and
35

Seguin to socialize (Limmer 2012a). Increased mechanization eventually ended the need for oil camps
and workers moved into the nearby towns.
Just east of the T-538 line on Dowdy road are the remains of the Dowdy school, which served the
children of the oil camps (Figure 12). Originally opened in 1916, oil royalties allowed the school to
expand to include a school house, a residence for teachers, a library, and a gymnasium. By 1951 the oil
camps were gone and the Dowdy School closed as the area was consolidated into the Seguin school
district. The foundations and stairs are still visible.
The area today remains heavily dependent on agriculture and oil. Outside the nearby towns, the
population remains rural and relatively dispersed. A significant portion of the population lives in the area
but works in nearby cities such as San Antonio, Austin, and San Marcos.

METHODOLOGY
The methodology for this project consisted of a file search, followed by field survey. The file search
involved research on the THC archaeological Site Atlas, in LCRA internal archives, and of topographical
maps of the area, from both the United States Geological Survey and the Army Corps of Engineers,
dating from 1911 to 1964. The purpose of the file search was to find areas of high probability for
archaeological sites, both historic and prehistoric. Historic high probability areas were determined based
on structure locations plotted on topographic maps near the T-538 transmission line. Prehistoric high
probability areas were determined by various factors, including: presence of Holocene deposits,

36

landforms, proximity to water sources, etc. The result of this process was 32 historic high probability
areas and 7.39 miles of prehistoric high probability areas to be surveyed in the field.
LCRA Cultural Resources staff followed CTA field survey standards, which require 16 shovel tests per
mile of high probability areas for linear projects, except where ground surface visibility is greater than 30
percent. In accordance with CTA standards, LCRA Cultural Resources staff excavated shovel tests, 30-35
cm in diameter, down to either 100 cm bs or to the end of Holocene deposits, in 20 cm levels. Shovel tests
were generally concentrated in areas where the ground will be disturbed by construction, eg structure
locations, except where local conditions obviated the need for such tests.
Additionally, in areas with alluvium and high potential for buried deposits, LCRA Cultural Resources
staff used a skid-steer mounted auger to excavate subsurface tests 40 cm in diameter, in 20 cm levels and
to a depth of 120 cm to 140 cm bs. Auger tests were placed near proposed new structure locations and at
100 m intervals, except where buried utilities or petroleum pipelines made it dangerous to do so. All
deposits from both shovel and auger tests were screened in the field using Â¼-inch mesh screens. No
materials were collected during this survey.

RESULTS
The field survey was completed from January through March 2016. During the survey, ground surface
visibility was found to be variable and ranged from very good to poor. In many areas having deep sandy
soils, numerous pocket gopher burrow backdirt piles were present (see Figure 13). These backdirt piles
were always examined by the field crew as an additional method of evaluating subsurface deposits in
addition to shovel testing. Overall, a total of 97 shovel and auger tests were excavated. Although this
number is less than the 118 subsurface tests that would be expected for a project having 7.39 miles of
high probability areas, the field crew was aided in evaluating some areas by cutbank exposures and the
fact that in some areas bare patches of ground surface showed that topsoils had completely eroded away
leaving basal clay visible on the surface (Figure 13). The soil descriptions and artifact recovery from the
subsurface tests are presented in Appendix 1.

The 2016 survey of LCRAâs T-538 transmission line upgrade project produced seven new recorded sites,
of which two are historic, four are prehistoric, and one is multi-component. Six sites are in Guadalupe
County and one is in Caldwell County... The four prehistoric sites are all sparse lithic scatters near creek
channels. The two historic sites are both early to mid-twentieth century African-American occupations,
one of which is a farmstead in Guadalupe County, and the other is a possible farmstead inside the Luling
city limits in Caldwell County. The multi-component site consists of a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter and
a sparse historic artifact scatter. Additionally, one previously recorded historic period site, 41CW28 was
revisited during the survey. The sites are described in detail in the following paragraphs.
Site Descriptions
41GU183
Site 41GU183 is a multi-component site consisting of a prehistoric campsite and a historic debris scatter
(Figure 14). The site measures120 m north-south by 55 m east-west. The site is located on the lower part
of a terrace slope that overlooks the Darst Creek floodplain. The terrace has been previously disturbed by
land clearing for the construction of two separate electrical transmission line corridors and by oil drilling
38

activities. The site is less than 200 m east of the southernmost extent of Darst Oil Field. The soil is Darst
very gravelly sandy loam at the north end of the site and Demona loamy fine sand in the south (Ramsey
and Bade 1977). The sandy soils contain much gravel that is predominantly chert. The soil is also heavily
bioturbated by pocket gopher burrows.

Figure 14. Site 41GU183 sketch map.

In 2013, this area was partially investigated by LCRA Cultural Resources staff for the Deer Creek
substation project. The survey of this area ceased when the substation location was moved approximately
500 m south to abut ALT-90. Four shovel tests from this project are within 30 m of the T-538 ROW
corridor with ST#2 and 4 laying just outside the ROW. ST#3 and 4 on the west side of the ROW were
negative. ST# 1 and 2 on the east side of the ROW were positive, as 1 primary and several secondary and
tertiary flakes and chips were observed between 0 and 20 cm bs.
The 2016 project began with a surface survey in the T-538 ROW corridor. North of the 2013 shovel tests,
the very shallow soil of the ROW was heavily disturbed and only one chert flake was observed. Negative
ST#7 was dug to confirm the north boundary of the site. To the south of the 2013 shovel tests (Figure 15),
39

LCRA Cultural Resources staff observed a number of cultural materials, including: about 12 pieces of
chert debitage, some burned rocks (mostly burned chert), 3 stoneware glazed ceramic sherds, 1 piece of
porcelain dish, 4 pieces of glass, and some rusted metal that probably is old oil drilling equipment. Most
of the observed material rested on the ubiquitous pocket gopher mounds in the survey area. LCRA
Cultural Resources staff excavated a shovel test (ST#6) in the least bioturbated location available near a
surficial tertiary flake. This shovel test was excavated down to 75 cm bs in the sandy loam before
terminating at clay but was completely sterile. No shovel tests were placed farther south, though burned
chert and one modern ceramic fragment were observed as far as 24 m from shovel test #6. The site
boundary was drawn to encompass the burned chert scatter in the south and the chert flake to the north.
Within the LCRA electrical transmission line corridor, both the prehistoric and historic components of
site 41GU183 are diffuse and lacking in features. Much of the burned rock could be related to the burning
of vegetation when the transmission line corridor was originally cleared for construction. More
concentrated prehistoric remains may be expected east of the LCRA transmission line corridor on a slight
projection of a terrace into the Darst Creek floodplain. Additionally, a former historic farmstead may be
present somewhere nearby outside the transmission line corridor in areas not explored during the current
project. Site 41GU183 is assessed as being of low research value and no further investigations are
recommended. LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends this site to be ineligible for formal
designation as an SAL within the ROW. No special considerations or avoidance measures are
recommended at this time.

Site 41GU184
Site 41GU184 is a small lithic scatter, 20 m north-south x 10 m west-east, situated on a sandy upland
terrace top within the cleared T-538 corridor (Figure 16 and Figure 17). Darst Creek and a tributary
thereof are, respectively, located about 165 meters to the east and 200 m to the south. The soil is Demona
loamy fine sand and, at the hill crest, Crockett fine sandy loam (Ramsey and Bade 1977). Numerous
pocket gopher backdirt piles visible on the ground surface provide a sample of the subsurface rock
materials.
Surface survey revealed one thick core biface on a gopher backdirt pile at the eastern ROW edge. A
shovel test (ST#9) was placed in the immediate vicinity and yielded one tertiary chert chip in the 20 to 40
cm level and one tertiary chert chip in the 60-80 cm level. Shovel tests placed north and south were
negative. A shovel test (ST#57) placed 25 m west, on the opposite edge of the ROW, was positive,
yielding one chert primary flake in the 60-80 cm level. Otherwise, some burned pieces of chert are
present on the surface but it is difficult to determine if these are burned rock fragments from the Native
American occupation or if they are just the result of brush burning activities associated with the
transmission line corridor vegetation clearing activities. The site boundary was drawn to include the
positive shovel tests and some burned chert upslope.

Figure 16. View of site 41GU184, note numerous pocket gopher burrow backdirt piles on ground surface.

41

The cultural material at site 41GU184 is very sparse but there is potentially more material outside the
ROW to the northwest at the highest point of this low interfluvial ridge or, perhaps, to the southeast closer
to the creek. An old transmission line structure is inside the site boundaries and scheduled for removal but
should have no negative impact on the site. No new structure is being placed within the site boundaries.
The portion of site 41GU184 within the ROW corridor is of low research value and no further
investigations are recommended. The LCRA Cultural Resources team recommends that the part of this
site within the ROW is ineligible for formal SAL designation. No special considerations or avoidance
measures are recommended at this time.

Site 41GU185
Site 41GU185 is a small buried lithic scatter which runs 50 m southwest to northeast within a 20 m wide
ROW corridor (Figure 18). The site sits just below the crest of a gently sloping interfluvial hill situated
between Darst Creek and a small intermittent tributary thereof, 160 m to the east and 350 m to the south,
respectively. The Darst Oil Field is only 1 km to the east. The soil at the site location is Crockett gravelly
sandy loam (Ramsey and Bade 1977) with considerable gravel at the A-B horizon boundary.

Figure 18. Site 41GU185 sketch map.

Site 41GU185 consists of a small artifact assemblage observed in one positive shovel test (ST#16) and
includes: one unifacial expedient tool, one primary and one secondary flake, one burned chert potlid, and
one possible multi-directional core fragment. ST#16âs soil profile consisted of 20 cm of sandy loam over
sandy clay mixed with dense gravel/cobbles (40 percent +). A shovel test was placed 30 m southwest in

43

the ROW but was negative and struck the B horizon clay at 10 cm bs. A final shovel test was placed 75 m
northeast but was negative and just as shallow as the previous test. This test pit was placed so far away
from the original because of a gravel drive and a petroleum pipeline ROW in the intervening space. No
tests were placed to the east and west because of the narrow ROW and a fence to the west along the drive.
Additionally, the site sits between two houses just off the gravel drive and the ground was badly disturbed
all around. No surface material was observed due to the poor surface visibility.
Site 41GU185 is bounded on three sides by intermittent streams but sits high enough upslope to avoid
flooding, which fits well with established settlement patterns of hunter-gatherers in Central Texas (Collins
2004). It is speculated that the site may extend to the northwest to the crest of the hill, which seems to be
the most likely spot for occupation and looked to be relatively undisturbed. Site 41GU185 has very low
research value within the ROW, limited to locational data only, and no further investigation is
recommended. LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends the site to be ineligible for SAL status within
the ROW corridor. No special considerations or avoidance measures are recommended at this time.

Site 41GU186
Site 41GU186 is a sparse, mostly surficial lithic scatter of chert flakes and burned chert and sandstone,
which is 30 m wide and runs 80 m southwest-northeast centered on the ROW corridor (Figure 19). The
site sits in an open cow pasture on a gently sloping, low interfluvial ridge between Smith Creek 200 m
east and a small tributary thereof 100-200 m to the north and northwest. The site is situated about 400 m
downslope and to the northeast of the highest point of the lobe. The site is located roughly 1 km north of
the Darst Oil Field. The soil is Windthorst fine sandy loam over sandy clay (Ramsey and Bade 1977). The
soil is heavily eroded in the site location and vegetation is sparse, leaving large patches of bare earth.
Pocket gopher mounds are frequent.
At site 41GU186, surface survey remained within the 20 m wide ROW, though there were several
surficial artifacts easily visible from the ROW corridor, resting on bare patches of soil up to 20 m outside
the ROW to the south, concentrated near the eastern site boundary. Shovel tests showed the surface
sandy loam to be generally around 20 cm deep before bedrock equivalent clay was encountered. The first
shovel test (ST#30) was placed about 10 m outside of the artifact scatter to the northeast and was
negative. ST#31 was placed 20 m upslope, inside the scatter area and was likewise negative. ST#32 was
placed 60 m upslope and to the west where soil looked to be deeper and was positive. Artifactual material
observed included a tertiary flake and a primary chip as well as some burned chert. No further tests were
placed to the west due to visibly shallow soil and disturbances. ST#33 was then placed half way between
the previous two tests but was negative. Surface survey and shovel tests were then conducted in the ROW
farther afield near the creeks. To the southwest, the soil was visibly shallow and clay was visible in many
places at the surface. One negative shovel test was placed in the only area of testable soil depth. To the
northeast, the soil was also visibly eroded down to clay. Based on survey and testing the site boundary
was drawn to include the surface scatter and the positive shovel test within the ROW only.

44

Figure 19. Site 41GU186 sketch map.

Site 41GU186 may extend to the southwest along the ridge to the crest but this area was outside the scope
of this project. An old transmission line structure is inside the site boundaries and scheduled for removal
but should have no negative impact on the site. One new structure is being placed within the site
boundaries but should have a negligible impact on the site. The portion of site 41GU186 located within
the ROW is of low research value, providing only locational data, and no further investigations are
recommended. LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends this site to be SAL ineligible within the
ROW. No special considerations or avoidance measures are recommended at this time.

Site 41GU187
Site 41GU187 is an early to mid-twentieth century farmstead, through the center of which runs the T-538
ROW corridor (Figure 20). The site is 130 m west to east within the approximately 20 m wide ROW. The
farmstead sits at the crest of a gently sloping interfluvial hill between two tributaries of Smith Creek
located 300 m to the northeast and the southwest. The site is located roughly 1 km north of the Darst Oil
Field. The soil is Windthorst fine sandy loam over sandy clay (Ramsey and Bade 1977). Cleared pasture
and crop lands lie to the east and south.

45

Site 41GU187 is a small farmstead with the portion of the site within the transmission line ROW
consisting of a drive, a portion of a porch foundation, a small trash scatter, and a part of a corral. Outside
the ROW, approximately 10 outbuildings associated with the home are visible. The drive enters the site
from the southwest directly in front of a house and porch foundation. The house was of pier and beam
construction and is no longer present, but the outline can be discerned from the remaining concrete steps
and the concrete porch, which faces southeast toward the drive, then wraps around to face northeast. A
partially buried open concrete cistern is about 16 ft west of the rear of the house. Between the drive and
the porch is a scatter of historic trash, including a cast iron enameled bathtub made by Standard Sanitary
Mfg Co in Louisville (Kentucky), possibly in 1932, as indicated by faint manufacturerâs marks on the
underside. At the eastern end of the site is the south fence of a relatively large corral, including a cattle
neck and body clamp device.

Figure 20. Site 41GU187 sketch map.

Outside of the ROW, to a distance of up to 120 feet, numerous structures are visible both to the north and
the south. The following describes what was visible from the ROW corridor and distances were measured
using aerial imagery. The majority of the outbuildings lie to the north and northeast. The buildings are
typically wood plank and corrugated metal and are generally in ruin and collapsing. A multi-use shed and
chicken coop sits 65 ft directly north of the house. Sixty-five ft northeast of the shed is a small structure

46

which may have been a pump house. Sixty-five ft east-northeast of the possible pump house is a larger
building that appears to be a small animal shed of some kind. The structure 85 ft south of the animal shed
is likely a garage, as indicated by a ramped concrete slab floor. Just 30 ft northeast across a truck path
from the garage sits a relatively large pole barn, 26 x 40 ft, open to the southwest and enclosed on the
other three sides. Some of the wood used is salvaged, as one of the wood planks used in the roof is from
an airplane hearse service advertisement. Attached to the pole barn to the southeast is a small fenced
animal pen which connects to a larger corral to the east. One hundred and five ft southeast of the larger
corral, across the ROW and truck path, is another small outbuilding of indeterminate use. Approximately
65 ft southwest of this building is a completely collapsed structure. This last structure is about 100 ft
south of the large corral. The LCRA electrical transmission line follows the truck path running through
the site from west to east. A hand-dug brick lined well, at least 20 feet deep and retaining water and likely
associated with the farmstead, sits 750 ft south of the house and just east of the drive, which is the access
road.
Observed materials are consistent with an early to mid-twentieth century occupation age. Some cursory
internet research yielded information about some observed time-diagnostic objects, consisting of: a
Firestone brand refrigerator, which was only produced by that company in the 1940s and very early
1950s; an electric washing machine with a wringer/mangle attachment, which style dates generally to the
1930s and 1940s; and a Parmak brand electric fence control box which dates to the 1940s; as well as the
aforementioned cast iron tub.
Shovel testing found no subsurface cultural material. The first shovel test was sandy loam over a layer of
gravel fill from an outside source over clay. The gravel seems obviously to be a drive constructed over a
surface graded down to clay. Both a second and third shovel test were placed to the northeast, at the
boundary between the farmstead and a pasture, and both were negative. Shovel testing was limited due to
disturbance by the drive over the majority of the ROW corridor. Aerial imagery available on GIS and onsite observations were used to map the extent of the structures on the farmstead.
A records search indicated that the property was part of the Josias Randolph survey, granted by the
Republic of Texas in 1838 (Texas General Land Office [TXGLO] 2015). No other information about the
property during the nineteenth century was available. According to LCRA archives, the transmission line
ROW easement was sold originally to the Central Power and Light Company on August 8th, 1929, by C.
H. and Shellie Adams, an African-American couple. Records of the U.S. Census surveys
(www.archives.com 2015) conducted between 1900 and 1940 show a Mr. Charles H. Adams (b. 1888)
residing in Guadalupe County. In 1900 and 1910, Charles Adams is shown as living in the household of
his mother and father, William and Jennie Adams, who owned a farm free of mortgage in Guadalupe
County.
William Adams was a farmer, born in Missouri around 1844, and was married to Jennie Adams, born
around 1851 in Virginia. The couple appears in records as early as the 1870 Census, in which he is listed
as a farmer and Jennie kept house in Guadalupe County. The family appears to have been in Texas since
at least 1860, as the oldest child, 10 year old William, is listed as having been born in Texas. Based on
this information, it is highly likely that this was a family of former slaves, living in Texas, who were

47

emancipated when the Civil War came to an end. By the 1900 Census, William is listed as owning a farm
free of mortgage, upon which he and his family lived, including 12 year old Charles.
By the 1920 Census, Charles H. Adams is shown as married to Shellie Adams (b. 1893), and owning a
farm free of mortgage in Guadalupe County. Considering that his father, William Adams, was listed as
age 67 in 1910, and is not listed in the 1920 Census records, it very possible Charles inherited his fatherâs
farm. By the 1940 U.S. Census, the last year for which records are currently available, Charles and Shellie
Adams are still listed as owning a farm free of mortgage in Guadalupe County, upon which they lived
with their seven children, including 16 year old Shellie Adams.
Census records beyond 1940 are unavailable, and the Guadalupe County Appraisal District website only
lists the current property owner. In a brief phone conversation with LCRA Cultural Resources staff, the
landowner, a Mr. Mergele, stated he had purchased the property between 2007 and 2009 from an elderly
Mrs. Shirley Harris, whom he knew was the married daughter of a Charles Adams. While no Shirley
Adams is listed among Charles and Shellieâs children in the 1940 Census, a sixteen year old Shellie is,
and it is likely she to whom Mr. Mergele refers. Mr. Mergele also stated that his grandfather had known
Charles Henry Adams, and that the property in question was inherited by Mrs. Harris from her father. He
also relayed that the house and outbuildings on the property were related to Charles Adams and Shirley
Harrisâ occupations of the property. No further records were located referring to Mrs. Harris.
Based on the various chains of evidence, it appears site 41GU187 was an African-American farmstead,
possibly dating as far back as 1900, under the ownership of William Adams, and was retained within the
family for over 100 years. As discussed above in the Historical Background, many African-American
families owned farmsteads on Nash, Darst, and Smith Creeks in the area and the Adams family farmstead
seems to be one of these.
The LCRA Cultural Resources team assesses the portion of site 41GU187 situated within the ROW to be
of low research value and no further investigations are recommended. The LCRA Cultural Resources
team recommends the part of site 41GU187 within the ROW is not to be eligible for SAL status. The
removal of the current transmission line structure will have no impact on the site and the proposed new
structure location is well outside the site boundary. The LCRA Cultural Resources team recommends no
special considerations or avoidance measures at this time.

Site 41GU188
Site 41GU188 is a sparse lithic scatter within the T-538 ROW corridor on the alluvial terrace of the north
(left) bank of Nash Creek. At this location Nash Creek is deeply incised, though a crossing has been
created for the truck path along the transmission line (Figure 21). A relatively steep hill overlooks the
creek about 350 m south of the site. A low secondary terrace rises about 50 m north of the creek bank and
the ground continues to rise gently to the north of the site. There are many small tributaries of Nash Creek
in this area. Darst Oil Field lies about 3 km to the east. The soil at the site is Uhland loamy alluvium,
which is of Holocene age, is derived from mixed sources and occurs in level flood plains of central Texas
(Ramsey and Bade 1977). At the northern site boundary, where the second terrace begins, the soil
48

changes to the Crockett series, fine sandy loam (Ramsey and Bade 1977). The soil at this location on the
northern site edge is considerably eroded by animals and vehicle traffic. The vegetation at the site consists
of short and tall grass, prickly pear, and dewberry within the narrow ROW and post oak and yaupon holly
at the wooded edges of the ROW and surface visibility ranged from 5 percent to 100 percent.

Figure 21. Site 41GU188 sketch map.

This site is a narrow lithic scatter approximately 70 m north-south within the narrow 10 m wide
transmission line ROW corridor. Only one surficial artifact, a chert tertiary flake, was observed and all
other observed material came from three positive shovel tests. The first shovel test, ST#62 was excavated
49

at the location of the proposed new structure. All material recovered from ST#62 was from the first level
(0-20 cm bs) and included one good tertiary flake and several possible tertiary and secondary chert chips
and chunks, as well as eleven small pieces of burned chert. The next shovel test was excavated 50 m to
the north, well into the secondary terrace, near where a vehicle and animal path intersected the ROW
corridor. This test was negative as was the next shovel test, which was excavated at the midpoint between
the previous two tests. This test was at the edge of the secondary terrace just a few meters from the only
surficial artifact observed. Two more positive shovel tests were excavated; one, ST#65 (Figure 22),
located 20 m to the south of ST#62 and one more a further 10 m south at the edge of the primary terrace
at the creek bank. ST#65 had cultural material, mostly tertiary flakes and chips, observed down to nearly
45 cm bs. ST#66 had cultural material observed down to 20 cm bs only; mostly secondary and tertiary
flakes and chips.

Figure 22. View of site 41GU188 with archaeologist working at ST#65.

Based on shovel testing and surface survey, the site boundaries were drawn within the ROW corridor
from the creek-side terrace edge to the surficial artifact observed at the edge of the secondary terrace, 70
m to the north. The majority of the prehistoric artifacts were found at the south end on the site in ST#65
and 66. It is likely the site extends east and west outside the ROW corridor along the alluvial terrace but
these areas were not able to be investigated during this project. No time diagnostic artifacts were
observed. Additionally, there are many small chert cobbles in this area but the vehicular traffic along the
ROW truck path has crushed many of them, making it difficult sometimes to distinguish damaged cultural
material from non-cultural chert material.
The availability of chert and the numerous low hills and creeks in this locality would have made it a good
area for lithic procurement and occasional occupation by prehistoric people. Site 41GU188 provides
locational data but the portion of the site in the ROW is otherwise of low research value. LCRA Cultural
50

Resources staff recommends no further investigations at this site for the current project. LCRA Cultural
Resources staff also recommends that the portion of site 41GU188 within the T-538 ROW corridor is not
be eligible for SAL designation. One old transmission line structure will be removed from the north site
boundary and should have no negative impact on site 41GU188. One new structure will be placed near
the site center and should have a negligible impact on site 41GU188. LCRA Cultural Resources staff
recommends no special considerations or avoidance measures at this time.
Site 41CW170
Site 41CW170 is a historic occupation, possibly a farmstead, situated on the north edge of the town of
Luling, Texas (Figure 23). The site appears to date to the early to mid-twentieth century and is 128 ft long
within the approximately 60 ft wide LCRA transmission line ROW corridor. The site sits about half way
up a gently sloping hill about 100 m west of a small drainage to Salt Branch, which itself lies 600 m to the
south. The site is located less than 1 km west of the Salt Flat Oil Field. The soil is Crockett gravelly
sandy loam (Lowther and Werchan 1978). Due to brush clearing and winter defoliation of the vegetation,
visibility at this location was generally quite good.

Figure 23. Site 41CW170 sketch map.

Site 41CW170 is bisected through its center by LCRAâs T-538 transmission line corridor, which is
approximately 60 feet wide. The boundaries of this site are confined to the ROW corridor, which is the
only area able to be investigated by the LCRA in this project, but the site obviously extends north and

51

south at least another 40 ft or so in either direction. Investigations consisted of surface survey, mapping,
and limited shovel testing.
The site is located on North Hackberry Avenue, which is the old Luling to Lockhart Highway. LCRA
records from 1928 show a house measuring 24 ft x 40 ft in plan view located 118 ft south of the
transmission line. A dilapidated structure was observed at that approximate location but not investigated,
as it was outside the ROW. Three structures remain standing within the ROW, all of which are at the
eastern site edge (Figure 24). Beginning at the south and ending at the north site boundaries, the buildings
are described below. There is a 10 ft x 20 ft wooden shed, likely a small shop, as there is a workbench and
some broken TVs (ca. 1970s) inside. Outside the east wall is a scatter of bricks, with each brick
measuring approximately 8 in x 4 in x 2 in, and labeled âACME BRICKâ within the frog. Ten ft north of
the shed is an approximately 4 ft square outhouse with a concrete foundation and bowl and the remnants
of a wooden seat and tar shingles used as siding. Seventeen ft north of the outhouse is a storage building
with a smaller south room, about 13 ft square, connected by a covered breezeway to a larger north room,
about 24 ft x13 ft. Both rooms contained modern rubbish, though the larger room also contained two or
three rows of auditorium-style seating. To the west, near Hackberry Avenue, is a concrete walkway
running north-south, which connects to two steps leading up to a concrete foundation slab raised about 7
inches above the ground surface. To the east of the steps are the remnants of a wall painted bright green
and white. Just north of this foundation slab, at the north site boundary, was a small scatter of red
unfrogged bricks marked âKOOKENâ. The walkway leads to other concrete foundation slabs outside the
ROW to both the north and the south.

Figure 24. View of structures witin the T-538 corridor at site 41CW170.

Outside the ROW corridor and site boundaries, the following features are visible due to the cleared and
defoliated vegetation. These features are included in this report only because of their close association
52

with site 41CW170. A raised slab to the north of the ROW has water and toilet plumbing connections and
a possible Men's Room sign was observed. Where the walkway turns to front the northernmost slabs,
there are two 6 ft tall tubular, round metal poles flanking the walkway. To the south of the site is another
raised concrete slab foundation, partially painted red, 6 feet east of which is a brick cistern. Another
structure outline was visible to the south as a change in vegetation color. Southeast of the site is a trash
scatter with a wringer/mangle style washing machine visible, a style popular from the late 1930s to 1950s.
Southeast of the trash scatter sits the aforementioned structure noted in the 1928 LCRA documents and an
associated smaller structure resembling a chicken coop.
Once the surface was surveyed and the site mapped, LCRA Cultural Resources conducted limited shovel
testing. A shovel test placed in the location of the proposed new transmission line structure was negative.
Another shovel test was placed at the center of the observed features. This shovel test consisted of 6 cm (2
in) of sandy silty loam over 16 cm (6 in) of outside gravel fill over intact clay, where the shovel test was
terminated. A single ring pull tab was observed in the gravel fill layer. Shovel probes indicated the gravel
layer extends across the rest of the site in a rough square centered around the main concentration of
foundation slabs. No other shovel tests were excavated due to ground disturbance.
Site 41CW170 is in a historically black neighborhood of Luling and is on the northwest border of a park
and athletic facilities built by Edgar B. Davis in the 1920s for the use of Luling's African-American
community. Archival research indicates the land is on the Adolphin Floyd survey, which was patented to
Floyd's family in 1841(TXGLO 2015). Floyd himself died defending the Alamo in 1836. No other
records were available regarding the property until the early twentieth century. LCRA records show the
transmission line easement was bought for $10 in 1929 from Ira and Anna Askey, a farmer and a teacher
respectively. The land was granted to the Askeys in 1924 by Anna's father, William Sloan, who, at
various times, was a farmer and a salesman of toiletry articles, according to U.S. Census Records. The
1940 Census records indicate the widowed Anna Askey (age 52) was still living at the location and
renting a room to a young couple. The 1940 Census Enumeration District map of Luling shows the land
as the Sloan tract. 1940 is the last year for which Census records are currently available. According to
Caldwell County Appraisal District records, the current land owner bought the property in 2008 and the
previous owner was Sam Ketchum, a member of another African-American family long residing in
Luling. The current landowner does not live on the property and could not be contacted.
Records, features, and artifactual material indicate a small farmstead or home of an African-American
family beginning in at least the mid-1920s. The structure observed outside the ROW and noted in the
1928 LCRA document likely dates to this occupation. The Kooken bricks may date to the 1920s
occupation as well. The Kooken Pressed Brick Company was formed around 1919, in Ferris, Texas, and
merged with five other companies to form the Ferris Brick Company in 1923 (McKnight 2003). At some
later date, the property seems to have been built up and expanded into a larger complex of buildings. The
gravel configuration may suggest a parking lot surrounding a building or buildings. The standing
structures are all located right at the edge of the gravel and may have been constructed to flank the gravel
lot (or vice versa). The presence of a possible gravel parking lot, a menâs room sign, and bright green
paint also indicates the site may at some point in time have been a public structure, such as a community
center, school, or church; or it may have been a business.

53

Site 41CW170 is roughly 5 percent intact and in poor condition within the ROW. The state of several
likely associated structures outside the LCRA transmission line ROW remains unassessed. The research
value of the portion of the site 41CW170 within the ROW is low, and, thus, that part of the site is
assessed as not eligible for SAL designation as the buildings are mostly gone and there is very little
artifactual material remaining. No further investigations are recommended, within the ROW. Other parts
of 41CW170 outside of the transmission line ROW appear to have an undetermined eligibility for formal
designation as an SAL. During the current upgrade project, a new transmission line structure is slated to
be placed outside the site to the east and an old structure within the site boundaries is to be removed.
Neither activity should have a negative impact on the site. LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends
no special considerations or avoidance measures at this time.

OTHER AREAS

Site 41CW28 and the San Marcos River Alluvial Plain
Between I-10 and Luling, the T-538 line traverses a deep alluvial floodplain of the San Marcos River for
a distance of 5.8 km. In order to attain a greater depth and more quickly investigate the floodplain, LCRA
Cultural Resources staff used a skid-steer mounted auger in lieu of shovels for subsurface testing, as
described above in the Methodology section. The locations of the 21 auger tests dug on the river
floodplain are shown in (Figure 25).
Prior to the start of the augering, a bifacial tool fragment was noted on a gravel road outside the ROW on
the higher terrace above and to the southwest of the flood plain, but no cultural material was observed in
adjacent transmission line corridor in that area. Additionally, no cultural materials were found in ST#51
which was close to the surface find. Auger tests in the southern half of the river floodplain area had clay,
clay loam and silty clay deposits that were sterile.
The northern part of the floodplain area is within undeveloped City of Luling parkland that was originally
a pecan orchard but has mostly been utilized as an oil field in recent years. Auger Tests #90-93 were
placed at each of the four new structure locations. Three additional auger tests, #95-97, were placed
between the structures and one auger test, #94, was placed where the transmission line comes closest to a
bend in the San Marcos River. Soil profiles were consistent, with a darker brown clay loam down to
around 60 cm bs, over a brown clay loam down to around 140 cm bs, where a slightly lighter brown clay
loam ran to termination depth between 145 cm and 160 cm bs. This is consistent with observations of a

It is important to note that the far eastern site boundary for site 41CW28 extends into the transmission
line ROW on the San Marcos River floodplain. The actual Zedlerâs Mill complex at 41CW28 is located
on the north bank of the San Marcos River outside of the transmission line corridor. The only portion of
55

the defined site area that will be impacted by ground-disturbing activities is located on the opposite
(south) side of the river downstream from the mill where Auger Test #90 was excavated. The only artifact
found in Auger Test #90 is a metal object from Level 4 (60-80 cm bs). The artifact is thought to be an
early to mid-twentieth century date that possibly from a tractor or some unidentified type of oil field
machinery rather than an artifact associated with the mill (Figure 27). No other artifacts were found in
nearby Auger Tests #97 or 91 to the southwest. Northeast of Auger Test #90, the remainder of the ROW

between the south site boundary and the river was submitted to surface survey but not subsurface testing
because no other ground disturbances are expected during this project. During the surface survey, several
early to mid-twentieth century bricks were observed but were obviously part of river bank stabilization
fill. North of the river, there is one new transmission pole structure that will be erected just northeast of
the boundary of 41CW28. This location was surface surveyed but no subsurface testing was conducted
because the new structure will be placed in the same location as the old structure, the structure is located
on the man-made embankment of HWY 80, and because there was a risk of striking buried utilities.
Smith Creek Crossing
Smith Creek lies between site 41GU186 to the west and the Malone substation to the east. In this area are
both the main channel and a tributary of Smith Creek. The banks of both of these stream channels are
deeply incised and heavily eroded in the ROW corridor. LCRA Cultural Resources staff surveyed both
channels in case ramped gravel stream crossings are constructed for vehicles to access structure locations.
At the main channel of Smith Creek, LCRA Cultural Resources staff placed a shovel test on both sides of
the creek. Both tests were negative for cultural material. Where the ROW corridor crosses the tributary,
56

the channel is actually several deeply incised and badly eroded channels. No shovel tests were placed in
this area, as surface and cutbank observations revealed that much of the surface sandy loam had been
washed away in high energy floods leaving only pre-Holocene clays to remain.
Luling
Survey within Luling city limits is constrained to only certain areas because most structures will be
replaced in the same location, and because there are very few high probability areas. At the northern city
limits, shovel and skid-steer mounted auger subsurface tests were conducted along the stream channel of
Salt Branch but no cultural material was observed.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

An intensive cultural resources survey of the LCRAâs proposed T-538 Deer Creek to Luling Electrical
Transmission Line Upgrade Project was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resources staff from January
through March 2016. Seven new sites were recorded, including four prehistoric sites, two historic sites,
and one multi-component site. A portion of previously recorded site 41CW28 was also investigated
(Table 4: T-538 upgrade project sites, types, and recommendations.
).
The four prehistoric sites, sites 41GU184, 41GU185, 41GU186, and 41GU188, were sparse lithic scatters
of chert flakes and occasional burned rock. No tools or diagnostics were observed at these sites. No
avoidance measures or special considerations are recommended for these sites. These sites are of low
research value and the portions of these sites within the transmission line corridor are all recommended as
ineligible for formal designation as SALs...

Site 41GU187 is a historic African-American farmstead with material generally dating to the 1930s and
1940s. Though numerous structures remain standing, none are within the project area, nor will they be
57

affected by the project. The foundation and fenceline intruding into the ROW corridor will not be
negatively affected by the project. No avoidance measures or special considerations are recommended for
this site. The portion of the site within the project area is deemed to be of low research value. This site is
recommended to be ineligible for SAL status within the ROW.
Site 41CW170 is the other historic site recorded during this survey. This site is likely a historic AfricanAmerican farmstead dating to the 1920s, where other buildings were constructed at a later date. These
later structures seem to have been of a more public nature, and may have been a community center,
church, school, or business. The project should have a negligible impact on this site. No avoidance
measures or special considerations are recommended for this site. The portion of this site within the
project area is assessed as not eligible for formal designation as a SAL.
Site 41GU183 is the only multi-component site, consisting of a sparse lithic scatter and a sparse historic
artifact scatter. The site was highly disturbed by previous transmission line construction activity, and is
heavily bioturbated. No avoidance measures are recommended for this site. This site is deemed to be of
low research value. This site is recommended as ineligible for SAL status within the project area.
The far southeastern edge of previously recorded site 41CW28 also known as the Zedlerâs Mill site, is
situated within the project area. No significant or potentially significant remains associated with the mill
site were found during investigations within the transmission line ROW. The portion of the site within
the ROW is assessed as not eligible for formal designation as a SAL.
The LCRA Cultural Resources staff considers the T-538 Deer Creek to Luling electrical transmission line
project to be completely investigated. No special considerations or avoidance measures are recommended.
Emergency discovery procedures remain in place, as always.

118 support structures. A map and file review indicated that eight of these are in areas of moderate to high
probability for unrecorded archaeological sites. The high probability areas totaled approximately 4,000
feet in length, for a total project area of about 9 acres (see Figure 30-Figure 33).
A cultural resources survey was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resources staff on February 19, 2016.
Each high probability areas was examined and a shovel test placed at each replacement structure location,
excepting one in a highly disturbed, plowed field with 100 percent visibility.
One previously unrecorded archaeological site was documented. The site is a minor lithic scatter and
minor historic scatter. The site is considered to be fully documented within the project area and is
recommended as ineligible for formal listing as a State Antiquities Landmark.
Given the limited nature of the project, the short format report is used here. Detailed culture history will
be included in the annual report where the final will reside.
No artifacts were collected during the project; project records will be submitted to an accredited curation
facility.
NATURAL SETTING

The project areas is within the Blackland Prairie region of central Texas. The geology is primarily
Cretaceous-aged Navarro and Taylor group marl and a small amount of Eocene-aged Midway group clays
and sands, and a lesser amount of Late Pleistocene terrace deposits (Barnes 1974). Soils in high
probability areas are mapped as Heiden clay, Houston Black clay, and Tinn clay (Soil Survey Staff 2016).
Observed conditions included broad areas of cropland, some pasture, and wooded riparian zones. The
largest drainage is Wilbarger Creek, located at the western end of the project area. Other streams include
Cottonwood, Willow and Little Willow, and Dry Brushy creeks and their tributaries.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODS

The assessment was designed to identify and evaluate archaeological sites potentially impacted by the
construction project. The only significant new soil disturbance is at transmission structure locations,
where new structures will be placed within about 3 meters of present structures. Therefore shovel tests
were placed adjacent to existing structures in high probability areas. Given the nature of the dense, clayey
Vertisols, tests were excavated to depths of 40 cm. This often was enough to reach an apparent B horizon.
Shovel test and other items of interest were collected on a GPS with typical 3-meter accuracy. Shovel test
82

data is summarized in Table 5. Other records consisted of shovel test profiles, field notes and
photographs.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
41TV2505
One previously unrecorded multi-component archaeological site was documented. Site 41TV2505 is a
very sparse lithic scatter with a minor historic component located across the toe of an upland ridge system
overlooking Wilbarger Creek to the east (see Figure 34). It is within a plowed, terraced agricultural field
of Heiden clay that rises about 20 feet above the floodplain. The multiple terraces are as much as a meter
tall, indicating significant ground disturbance. No shovel tests were attempted due to 100 percent
visibility and degree of past impacts.

Figure 28. Setting of 41TV2505 looking west. Note contouring visible at tire tracks.

The prehistoric component consists of two cores, a heavily patinated hard hammer flake, a couple of other
flakes and flake fragments, a thin, late stage biface, and, most notably, a small polyhedral blade core. The
historic component, located at the eastern field edge, consisted of a single piece of solarized glass, a thick
piece of clear bottle glass, and a well and associated windmill. The well is presently constructed of
cement, and is about three feet in diameter. The remains of a brick collar demonstrate its age relative to
the present feature.
The site, while barely registering as such, is interesting for its lithic assemblage. Nearby fields are heavily
littered with chert and quartzite cobbles, so resource availability would not be an issue. The blade core,
however, suggests high mobility, and is most likely an artifact of Toyah phase people. It is probable that
there is a more substantial site located nearby. The historical artifacts merely indicate long-term land
83

usage, most likely starting with the Bohls family, which, according to LCRA records, deeded it to Joseph
and Adele Jaworski in 1936. The site is not considered eligible for formal SAL status.

Shovel test 4 encountered two small pieces of glass, one solarized (see Figure 31). A second shovel test
was therefore placed on the opposite side of the transmission structure. This was negative for cultural
material. Examination of the surround ground and broader landscape shoed no evidence of nearby
structures, and the area, much like at 41TV2505, had been severely terraced. No other artifacts were seen
84

in the vicinity. These two pieces of glass are considered to be isolated finds and were not given a
trinomial designation.
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

LCRA proposes to conduct work on the existing T-421 transmission line between the Elgin Switch and
Gilleland Creek substations. The project consist of replacing 11 existing support structures, eight of
which are considered to be in moderate to high probability areas for archaeological sites. A cultural
resources assessment consisting of a map and file review followed by a field survey resulted in the
recording of 41TV2505. The site is a minor prehistoric lithic scatter with a small historic artifact scatter
and field well with windmill. The site is considered to be fully investigated within the project area and is
recommended as ineligible for formal SAL status. It is recommended the project be allowed to proceed as
described.

Project 4.16: An Intensive Cultural Resource Survey of the Lower Colorado River Authorityâs
Proposed T-544 Altair to Glidden Transmission Line Upgrade Project, Colorado County, Texas

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to rebuild the majority of its T-544 electrical
transmission line which extends for a length of 12.2 miles from the Altair Substation to the Glidden
Substation in Colorado County, Texas (Figure 35, Figure 36, and Figure 37). At the northwest end of the
T-544 route, where the line shares an 80 ft wide right-of-way (ROW) with LCRAâs T-113 transmission
line, approximately 2.4 linear miles of the T-544 alignment were surveyed for cultural resources in 2008
with two sites, 41CD157 and 41CD158, being recorded. The portions of these two sites within the
combined T-113 and T-544 ROW were assessed during a cultural resource assessment in 2015 for
maintenance work as not eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) (Prikryl
et al. 2016:549-553). The remainder of the T-544 ROW has never been surveyed for cultural resource
sites. Where possible, LCRA is proposing to increase the spacing between structures during the rebuild
activities so that many of the new structures will be placed at the locations in between the current
structures. As a result, ground-disturbing activities will occur in locations not previously impacted by the
placements of the original structures. Based on this, a cultural resource survey of the portion of the T-544
ROW not previously surveyed was warranted.
During the period from March through May 2016, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted an
intensive cultural resource survey of high probability areas along the previously unsurveyed part of the T544 route. The survey consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing. Personnel who conducted the
fieldwork consisted of LCRA staff member Daniel J. Prikryl (Principal Investigator) along with
contracted archaeologists Matthew Larsen and Steven Evans. The investigation was conducted under
TAC Blanket Permit #7531, which was issued to the LCRA by the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
for Calendar Year 2016. All work was completed in accordance with methods for fieldwork and
reporting as proposed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (1992).
Approximately 55 acres were surveyed during the current investigation. One new cultural resource site,
41CD159, was recorded and assessed. The portion of this prehistoric campsite within the transmission
line corridor as well as the portions of previously recorded sites 41CD157 and 41CD158 within the
corridor are assessed as not meriting formal designation as SALs. The LCRA Cultural Resource staff
recommends that no additional cultural resource investigations are needed and that construction of the
upgrade project be allowed to proceed. Since the project had a âno collection policyâ, there are no
artifacts that will require curation. Project records will be submitted to an accredited curation facility.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located in the Gulf Coastal Plains (Fenneman 1938:100-103) in Southeast Texas. The
transmission line is located near the Colorado River with the main north-south running transmission line
segment ranging from 1 to 6.25 km west of the current river channel.
Surface geology at the northern end of the project area consists of Holocene era alluvium and Pleistoceneaged fluviatile deposits associated with the Colorado River channel, while the southern end of the project

sits on the Beaumont Formation (Barnes 1974). The Beaumont Formation is a Pleistocene formation
composed of clay, silt, and sand with concentrations of CaCO3 and iron oxides, and is noted as being
featureless. The formation also appears to be mostly upland area, and large portions of it lack notable
creek drainages.
According to the Colorado County Soil Survey, soils on the alluvial floodplain of the Colorado River in
the project area consist of Mohat loam, Gad loamy fine sand, Norwood silty clay loam, Bergstrom silt
loam, Wilson clay loam, and Brazoria clay (Soil Survey Staff 2014). On the Pleistocene aged first terrace
rise above the river floodplain, soils consist of a variety of sandy loams and fine sandy loams, and loamy
sands and fine loamy sands, the majority being Telf fine sandy loam, Telfner fine sandy loam, or TelfCieno complex. Approximately 3.34 miles, or 27%, of the transmission line, runs across areas reported by
the county soil survey as gravel mines or pits, and there are various other operations in existence along
the transmission line that are too recent to appear in the soil survey.

Vegetation shown is typical of this area, as is the general width and depth of the drainage.

Colorado County is an ecotone of three ecoregions (Griffith et al 2007), the Southern Blackland Prairies,
the Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Prairies, and the Southern Post Oak Savanna. Additionally, much of the
project area lies in or adjacent to the floodplains and low terraces of the Colorado River. The vegetation
of these ecoregions consists of prairie grasslands including little and big bluestem and yellow indiangrass,
among others, with occasional stands of oak, mostly Post oak. The floodplain of the Colorado River is
97

riparian woodlands consisting of oaks, elm, and pecan. Since European settlement, most of this region has
been converted to pasture and croplands. The waning of agriculture in recent times has left much of the
land overgrown with mesquite and various other acacias. Prehistorically, the fauna of the area would have
been typical of grassland and riparian environments and would have included, among others, deer, bison,
coyote, otter, and various freshwater fish, turtles and birds. The numerous spent gravel pits in the area
collect water, which attracts various waterfowl, and are often put to use as cow pastures.

CULTURE HISTORY
Prehistoric Background
The project area is located adjacent to the boundaries of the Southeast, South, and Central Texas
Archeological Regions (Patterson 1995; Hester 1995; Prewitt 1981). None of the authors of recent articles
on these three archeological regions claim Colorado County as being within their respective region of
interest. Skelton (1977) described the transitional nature of the Fayette and Colorado county area in the
discussion of his excavation work at the Fayette Power Project in nearby Fayette County. Skelton also
noted that J. Charles Kelley (1955) had previously advanced the notion that this area was a transitional
zone in prehistoric times. Specifically, Kelley discussed cultural relationships between coastal and inland
prehistoric groups and suggested that geographically diverse cultural groups may have co-existed within
this area.
Common prehistoric site types in the Colorado County area consist of open campsites, lithic
scatter/procurement sites, and cemeteries. Archeological investigations in neighboring areas have shown
occupation by Native American peoples for at least 13,000 years prior to the coming of Europeans. The
data show that throughout these millennia, prehistoric peoples were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved
across the landscape exploiting seasonally available plant and animal resources. In terms of a
chronological sequence for these nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples, Pattersonâs (1995:243) proposed
sequence for Southeast Texas, for example, is as follows: Early Paleoindian 10,000-8000 B.C., Late
Paleoindian 8000-5000 B.C., Early Archaic 5000-3000 B.C., Middle Archaic 3000-1500 B.C., Late
Archaic 1500 B.C.-A.D. 100, Early Ceramic A.D. 100-600, Late Prehistoric A.D. 600-1500, Protohistoric
A.D. 1500-1700, and Historic Indian A.D. 1700-1800.
Historic Background
The transmission line passes through the southern part of the City of Columbus, Texas and then extends
southward to the Altair community. Information on these communities and important historical events is
taken from The Handbook of Texas Online and is summarized in the following paragraphs.
According to legend, the City of Columbus was originally the location of an Indian village named
Montezuma. No specific data could be found on this village or its inhabitants. The first Anglo-American
settlers, Robert and Joseph Kuykendall and Daniel Gillehand, all members of Stephen F. Austinâs Old
Three Hundred, moved to the area near Columbus in 1821. In 1823, Benjamin Beeson, another early
settler, established a ferry across the Colorado River at the fledgling community, which became known as
98

Beesonâs Crossing. As early as 1822, the settlers in the area gathered at this spot for elections of local
officials of the Mexican governmentâs Colorado River District.
At the time of the Texas Revolution, the settlement was known as Columbus and had about 25 families.
Although Houstonâs army burned all of the buildings in Columbus during the Runaway Scrape, the town
was soon rebuilt after the Revolution and designated as the county seat of Colorado County in 1836. By
1847, it had 20 houses, 3 stores, 2 taverns, and a blacksmith shop. An early industry was a German cigar
factory that was established in 1840. Cotton production became the major economic pursuit in the 1850s
and continued to be important into the early twentieth century.
By 1880, there were 1,666 farms in Colorado County. However, like many other areas in Texas, the
period after the Civil War was marred by violence. A fresh wave of killings even occurred as late as
1906. Cattle production was also important to the economy, especially in the 1870s and 1880s. In 1883,
the Columbus Meat and Ice Company was established in Columbus. Exploitation of large sand and
gravel deposits became a flourishing industry in the first decade of the twentieth century. By 1910,
Columbus was said to be surrounded by gravel pits. Sand and gravel mining continues to be important to
the local economy today.
After World War II, a large part of Columbusâ local economy began to focus on recreational activities. In
Columbus, this focus centered on historic buildings and âdown-home atmosphereâ. Numerous historic
buildings were restored and the Magnolia Homes Tour was begun in 1961. In the year 2000, Columbus
had a population of 3,916 and 326 businesses. However, in 2010 the population had decreased to 3,655.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
There are relatively few previously recorded archeological sites within and around the project area. A file
search showed that in 2008 the LCRA Cultural Resources Team conducted an intensive cultural resource
survey for the portion of this line that extends for a length of 24.4 miles from the Columbus AEP
Substation, which is located in the southwestern part of the City of Columbus, and east of the Peters
Substation. As a result of this work, six new cultural resource sites, consisting of 41CD135-140, and one
previously recorded site, 41CD132, were recorded and assessed. The portions of sites 41CD135-140
within the transmission line corridor were assessed as not eligible for formal designation as SALs and no
restrictions or special conditions were recommended for any of these sites during any future LCRA
upgrade, overhaul and maintenance work activities. Site 41CD132 is a portion of the old elevated railroad
grade of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railroad that was constructed in 1860 adjacent to the
town of Alleyton. The railroad has been previously formally designated as a SAL. Avoidance of this site
is required during any future LCRA upgrade, overhaul and maintenance.
Additionally, during the 2008 LCRA survey of T-113, the LCRA Cultural Resources Team undertook an
assessment of the portion of the T-544 corridor that extends from the Columbus AEP Substation to the
Glidden Substation. Two new cultural resource sites, 41CD157 and 41CD158, were recorded and
assessed within the west end of the corridor between the Glidden and Columbus AEP substations (Figure
1). These sites are discussed in detail in the Survey Results section.
99

Other individually recorded sites in the vicinity of the T-544 line include 41CD60, 41CD120, 41CD121,
41CD124, 41CD154 and 41CD155. Site 41CD60 is a prehistoric campsite located just 180 meters north
of where site 41CD158 is situated within the T-544 ROW. Both of these sites are situated on the
Pleistocene terrace that overlooks the former Colorado River floodplain. Materials found in 1976 when
41CD60 was recorded include two broken arrowpoints, numerous flakes and five cores.
Elsewhere, prehistoric sites 41CD120 and 41CD121 were recorded during the All American Pipeline
Survey in 1986. The sites are situated on a Pleistocene terrace overlooking the former Colorado River
floodplain. They lie 1.5 and 1.6 km east of the T-544 ROW. Both sites are described as small lithic
scatters, although 41CD121 did include some burned rocks. Site 41CD124 is located 2.4 km east of the T544 ROW on a high terrace overlooking the confluence of McKenzie Creek and Colorado River. It is a
multi-component site with a Republic of Texas era historic component containing square nails, porcelain
and glass artifacts along with prehistoric materials dating from the Early Archaic through the Late
Prehistoric.
Sites 41CD154 and 41CD155 are apparently the two sites currently under investigations by the 20142016 Texas Archeological Society Field Schools. No information about the sites is available on the THC
Site Atlas. However, the TAS Newsletter has previously described 41CD154 as a lithic scatter and lithic
procurement site with dense chipped stone lithic debris. Site 41CD155 has been described as a buried
Late Prehistoric campsite on the Colorado River floodplain terrace.
At the Fayette Power Project, a 2,400 acre survey area on the Cedar Creek drainage yielded 10 historic
and 19 prehistoric sites. Most of the historic sites were associated with the historic Biegel Settlement,
which was founded in the mid-nineteenth century as a part of Austinâs Little Colony. Seven prehistoric
and three historic sites were recommended for excavation work. Skelton (1977) subsequently excavated
six of the prehistoric sites. Most of these prehistoric sites turned out to be shallow lithic scatters
interpreted as temporary upland work camps occupied intermittently over the last 8,000 years. At site
41FY74, however, the remains of a single butchered bison were found in association with Late Prehistoric
Toyah Phase artifacts and activity areas.

The closest published large-scale professional investigations consist of those for the proposed Columbus
Bend Reservoir and the Fayette Power Project. At Columbus Bend, which is located on the Colorado
River between La Grange and Columbus north of the western end of the project area, Nunley (1963)
recorded 36 archeological sites within Colorado County. The proposed reservoir was suspended until the
early 1980s when a modified reservoir proposal called the Colorado Coastal Plains Project was surveyed
by New World Research (Keller and Campbell 1984). A 20 percent sample survey led to the recording of
96 cultural resource sites in Fayette and Colorado counties. Site types included prehistoric lithic scatters,
lithic and ceramic scatters, stratified prehistoric sites, and historic sites. This reservoir project was then
cancelled by the Bureau of Reclamation.

100

METHODOLOGY
The methodology for this project consisted of a file search, followed by field survey. The file search
involved research on the THC archaeological Site Atlas, in LCRA internal archives, and of topographical
maps of the area, from both the United States Geological Survey and the Army Corps of Engineers,
dating from 1919 to 1963. The purpose of the file search was to find areas of high probability for
archaeological sites, both historic and prehistoric. Prehistoric high probability areas were determined by
various factors, including: presence of Holocene deposits, landforms, and proximity to water sources.
Historic period high probability areas were determined by noting the relationship of the transmission line
corridor to the towns of Columbus and Altair. Additionally, the locations at which the transmission line
crossed over or near recorded house structures and old roads on early maps were noted. Fieldwork then
focused on these prehistoric and historic period areas with high probabilities for cultural resource sites. A
total of 5.74 linear miles of the transmission line corridor were assessed as having a high probability for
cultural resource sites. Within this 5.74 linear mile area, 40 transmission pole structures will be replaced.
Fieldwork concentrated on these 40 locations with additional consideration being given to several high
probability areas adjacent to stream channels that might be affected by vehicular traffic.
The survey method involved inspecting the ground surface within 15 meters of each of the pertinent
structures, and excavating shovel tests near the structure poles to detect any subsurface cultural material.
In accordance with CTA standards, LCRA Cultural Resources staff excavated shovel tests, 30-35 cm in
diameter, down to either 100 cm bs or to the end of Holocene deposits, in 20 cm levels. Shovel tests were
generally concentrated in areas where the ground will be disturbed by construction. In some areas, local
conditions obviated the need for such tests. Such situations included terraces with numerous gopher
burrows where a sizeable sample of subsurface soils were mounded on ground surface, former and active
rice fields and their surrounding embankments where topsoils had been previously churned, and cutbanks
along creek channels and adjacent gravel pits that provided substantial soil profiles.

line.

A total of 50 shovel tests are reported. These include STs 35-50 which were actually dug in 2008 where
the T-544 and T-113 lines share the same corridor at the north end of the project area. All deposits from
the shovel tests were screened in the field using Â¼-inch mesh screens. No materials were collected during
this survey. The soil descriptions and artifact recovery from the subsurface tests are presented in
Appendix 1.
102

In several areas within the town of Columbus, intensive commercial and residential development and road
construction have heavily damaged or destroyed the original soil deposits within the transmission line
ROW to the extent that any cultural resource sites would have been destroyed. No survey work was
undertaken by the LCRA staff in such areas. These areas include of the stretch of transmission line
corridor that extends from the south edge of Interstate Highway 10 north to the Columbus Substation (see
Figure 1). Additionally, the area between STs #4 and 25 is a densely developed trailer park where much
of the transmission line corridor is either covered by asphalt roads, gravel-covered parking spots, small
yards or actual trailer houses (see Figure 1). Another area that could not be investigated is a scrap metal
yard that lies between the east edge of site 41CD157 and Business Highway 71 (see Figure 1). The
presence of dense piles of metal and car parts made survey impractical.
Also of special note is a non-urban area in the southern part of the project area that was covered by
pedestrian survey but was not shovel tested. This area contains rice fields on both the north and south
sides of McKenzie Creek (see Figure 2). Four transmission pole structures will be erected in this area.
This area has been modified to flatten the fields with minor raised embankments being located along the
eastern edges of the fields adjacent to McKenzie Creek. The actual rice fields contained some standing
water that made shovel testing impractical. The embankments along with scattered stretches of actual rice
fields provided adequate ground surface visibility to check for archaeological materials with none being
found.

RESULTS
The field survey was completed intermittently from March through May 2016. Previously recorded site,
41CD158 was revisited to check the current condition of the site and to further confirm that the portion
within the LCRA transmission line easement is not SAL eligible. Previously recorded site 41CD157 was
not revisited because the existing data indicated that it had already been heavily damaged at the time of its
previous recording. One new site, 41CD159, was recorded and assessed within the project area. These
three sites are described below.
41CD157
Site 41CD157 is a multi-component site with prehistoric and historic materials that is located about 150
meters west of the point at which the double circuited T-113 and T-544 transmission line crosses State
Highway 71 (Business) in the southwestern part of the City of Columbus. The portion of the site that was
recorded in 2008 in the T-113/T-544 corridor extends for a length of 85 meters between existing
Structures 24/6 and 24/5 (Figure 1). Previous work consisted of pedestrian survey and the excavation of
four shovel tests that were assigned the numbers 44 and 46-48 for the current project. Prehistoric artifacts
observed consisted of about 10 pieces of chert chipping debris that were seen on ground surface and in ST
#46 (Figure 42). No prehistoric features or diagnostic artifacts were seen. The historic component at site
41CD157 appears to be an early to mid-twentieth century trash dump. Historic artifacts were found on
ground surface and in three of the shovel tests. The historic materials are mostly nondescript pieces of
clear glass, scrap metal, pipe fragments and brick fragments. Some oyster shell fragments and marine
shell fragments were also seen on ground surface and in several of the shovel tests, but these probably
represent introduced fill for an old road bed.
Site 41CD157 is situated on the northeast edge of a former gravel pit. It is possible that the pit served as a
convenient spot for dumping trash during the early and mid-twentieth century. The removal of terrace fill
for the pit may have destroyed any part of the prehistoric component that extended southward. Overall,
the portion of the site within the transmission line ROW does not appear to have any research potential as
the prehistoric materials are sparse and the historic materials are also diffuse and date to relatively recent
times. Further, no intact features associated with either component were evident. The LCRA Cultural
Resources Team recommends site 41CD157 to be ineligible for formal designation as an SAL within the
ROW. No new structures will be placed within the site during the 2016 upgrade project and therefore no
ground disturbances are expected. The LCRA Cultural Resources Team recommends that all upgrade
activities within site 41CD157 be allowed to proceed without any restrictions or special conditions.

structures.

41CD158
The second site, 41CD158, is located on the terrace slope that is the boundary between the Colorado
Riverâs alluvial floodplain and the higher Pleistocene terrace top to the west. The site was recorded
during the survey of the T-113 upgrade project in 2008. Work consisted of pedestrian survey and the
excavation of four positive shovel tests which are labeled as STs #37-40 for the current project. The edges
of the site were defined by negative STs # 50 and 49 to the east and west. The overall length of the site
within the double circuited T-113 and T-544 ROW is about 100 meters, with existing Structure 25/1
being situated within the west central part of the site (Figure 43). A new transmission pole structure will
be erected about 10 meters east of this structure. The 1981 photorevised version of the Columbus 7.5â
USGS quadrangle indicates that some former sand and gravel quarrying occurred in the past on the
terrace slope where the site was found. This may be reflected by the absence of topsoil in some spots
within the site.
The work in 2008 indicated that site 41CD158 is a prehistoric campsite with observed cultural materials
consisting of about 16 chert flakes and chips, one chert biface thinning flake, one chert core, one burned
quartzite rock and three burned chert chunks. Aside from several chert flakes seen on ground surface, the
majority of the prehistoric artifacts were found in Shovel Tests #38 and 39 on the terrace slope in the
eastern half of the site with the artifacts scattered through topsoil deposits down to 60 cm below ground
surface. No diagnostic artifacts or evidence of features were found. A revisit during the current project
revealed no additional artifacts during pedestrian survey.

structures.

The portion of site 41CD158 within the transmission line corridor was previously assessed as not meriting
formal designation as a SAL due to its diffuse remains, the lack of diagnostic artifacts and features, and
the fact that the site had been previously damaged by gravel quarrying. The revisit did not alter that
assessment. The LCRA Cultural Resources Team recommends the proposed upgrade activities, including
the placement of the new structure, should proceed across the site without any special conditions or
restrictions.
41CD159
This prehistoric campsite is located on the north side of a tributary of McKenzie Creek (Figure 44). The
creek channel in this area has cut down about 20 ft in the terrace creating a prominent ridge overlooking
the creek channel. Previous vehicular traffic on an old road has created an eroded linear depression that
extends from the creek channel northward up the slope into the terrace top in the center of the ROW for a
length of about 25 meters. Soils consist of a 12 to 27 cm thick sandy loam topsoil above a sandy clay B
horizon. The ROW is currently a grassy field covered with short grasses, wildflowers and dewberry
bushes.
Cultural materials were first seen on the eroded terrace edge overlooking the creek channel and on the
eroded slopes of the old road. The materials included chert debitage as well as burned chert fragments that

were probably hearthstones. Similar materials were found in three shovel tests, STs #5-7. However,
artifact density was low, with ST #5 and 6 each producing just three pieces of chert debitage and ST #7
107

yielding just one piece of debitage. Six pieces of burned chert and two chert chunks were also found in ST
#5 and one such piece in ST #6. All of these artifacts were found in Level 1 of the shallow sandy loam
deposits that went down to depths of 12, 17 and 27 cm in the three positive shovel tests before hitting
basal clay. No other classes of artifacts were found nor were any features or diagnostic artifacts present.
The LCRA staff concludes that the portion of site 41CD159 within the transmission line corridor
represents an undated prehistoric campsite and that, based on the terrace topography, the majority of the
site lies upstream (west) of the ROW. The part of the site within the ROW is assessed as being of low
research value and not eligible for formal designation as a SAL due to the diffuse nature of artifacts in
shallow deposits and the lack of features and diagnostic artifacts. No new transmission pole structures
will be placed within site 41CD159 during the 2016 upgrade project with the closest new structure
placement being planned for an area about 60 meters north of the north end of the site.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The LCRA is proposing to rebuild the majority of its T-544 electrical transmission line from the Altair
substation to the Glidden substation in Columbus, in Colorado County. The new structures will be placed
farther apart than the old structures and will, therefore, impact previously undisturbed areas. A file search
led to the determination that 40 new structures are to be placed in areas of high probability for prehistoric
or historic cultural resources and should be surveyed. Survey within the high probability areas consisted
of surface inspection and shovel testing within the immediate area of the new structure locations and at
high probability areas at stream crossings.
The section of T-544 between Columbus and the Glidden substation was surveyed by the LCRA Cultural
Resources Team in 2008, resulting in one new multi-component site, 41CD157, and one new prehistoric
campsite, 41CD158, being recorded in the ROW. The portions of these sites within the transmission line
corridor had been previously assessed as not eligible for SAL listing, but site 41CD158 was revisited
during the current project.
The 2016 cultural resources survey of the previously unsurveyed section of T-544 between Columbus and
Altair resulted in the recording of one new prehistoric campsite, 41CD159, on the north bank of a
tributary to McKenzie Creek.
As a result of the 2016 survey, the LCRA Cultural Resources Team assessed all three sites recorded
within the T-544 ROW to be of low research value and recommends all three as ineligible for SAL status
within the ROW. The LCRA Cultural Resources Team recommends the T-544 electrical transmission line
upgrade project be allowed to proceed without any special considerations or avoidance measures.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are in place. Should the construction personnel
uncover any presently unknown buried archeological features during construction work, ground
disturbing activities in the immediate area of the discovery will cease until LCRA Cultural Resources
staff can contact the Texas Historical Commission to assess what, if any, mitigation efforts may be
necessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Lower Colorado River Authority is proposing to rebuild the T-260 electrical transmission line from
the Sim Gideon Power Plant to the Paige Split (Figure 46; Figure 47). This encompasses approximately
19.18 miles of transmission line with a 100 foot wide right of way, equaling approximately 111.27 acres
of project area. The project consists of removing all existing support structures, which are of lattice tower
construction, and replacing them with single-pole concrete or metal poles.
Although the line has been previously surveyed, those assessments were for right of way maintenance
only, and the previous work consisted of little more than reconnaissance. Therefore, a research design
commensurate with the present project was developed. High probability areas were determined based on
map and file reviews, including historical maps to help determine where historic period sites could be
present.
The project will also require a number of stream crossings, necessitating a United States Army Corps of
Engineers Nationwide 12 permit. All identified stream crossings were assessed due to the potential
presence of the federally-listed Houston toad, as well as the potential for archaeological sites eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The crossing-specific assessment is included
in this report as an appendix.
Stream crossings were added to standard high probability areas, although in most cases stream crossings
would have been considered high probability. These areas totaled 3.7 miles in length (about 19 percent) or
about 45 acres. Survey standards suggest about 60 shovel test for a project of this size. Seventy were
excavated.
Seven previously unrecorded archaeological sites (41BP942-41BP948) were documented, and one site,
41BP811, was revisited and reassessed. Previously recorded site 41BP674, formally assessed as ineligible
for listings, was briefly examined, but not reassessed. Poorly documented site 41BP3, plotted outside but
near the right of way, was not encountered.
None of the recorded sites are assessed as eligible for formal designations as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs) or NRHP status. This is largely due to the preponderance of loose, deep sands, extreme
bioturbation and the resulting lack of vertical or horizontal integrity. Likewise, there is a complete
absence of organic material other than recent charcoal from brush and forest fires. Historical materials
were often found below prehistoric artifacts.
No artifacts were collected during the project; project records will be submitted to an accredited curation
facility.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is within the East Central Texas Plains ecoregion, and crosses the Bastrop Lost Pines, the
Southern Post Oak Savanna, and the San Antonio Prairie as it proceeds from southwest to northeast
(Griffith et al. 2007). Much of the Lost Pines portion of the transmission line had been decimated by
recent forest fires (Figure 49). As the Southern Post Oak Savanna is approached the pine trees decrease in
frequency and are replaced by oak and hickory, sometimes with very dense underbrush, and by the time
the San Antonio Prairie is reached the trees decrease in density and a more open pasture is seen.
Soils are primarily Patilo-Demona-Silstid association sand and loamy fine sand, although the shift to the
San Antonio Prairie corresponds with Behring-Crockett-Heiden association loams, clay loams and clays
(Baker 1979). The sands correspond with the underlying Carizzo, Reklaw and Queen City sand and
sandstone formations, while the Cook Mountain clay formation probably accounts for the transition to the
loams and clays at the northeast portion of the project.
The line crosses a number of drainages, often near their heads, although the central portion crosses Alum
Creek and several of its tributaries. Alum Creek joins the Colorado River about 8 miles to the south. The
extreme northern portion of the line is within the Brazos river drainage system, although there are no
major associated streams.
The area is also notable for presence of the federally-listed Houston toad, which uses the soft sands for
hibernating and the numerous small pools for breeding.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
At the time of this report, there were 941 previously recorded archeological sites in Bastrop County. The
earliest archaeological investigations in the area appear to have been by Wilson (1930), who conducted
surveys in Travis, Bastrop, and Fayette Counties, though poor documentation of Wilsonâs findings has led
127

to problems relocating the sites that he discovered, as well as limited interpretation of his findings
(Nightengale and Moncure 1996). In 1953, The University of Texas sponsored excavations at 41BP1,
which contained two burials with Late Prehistoric artifacts (Campbell and Jelks 1953). In the 1960s, the
UT Austin Archeological Society conducted several excavations, including an excavation recorded by
Davis (1964), which involved another two burials with Late Prehistoric artifacts, and a variety of other
projects that involved primarily Archaic and Late Prehistoric encampments and lithic scatters. One
possible Paleoindian site, 41BP51, was excavated in this time period as well.
An avocational effort to document the Thunderbird site (41BP78) occurred in the countyâs northern
uplands (Duke 1977). The site appeared to have occupations ranging from the Archaic to the Late
Prehistoric (Nightengale and Moncure 1996).
Dillehay (1979) recorded a survey of an LCRA transmission line corridor that traversed parts of Fayette,
Caldwell, and Bastrop counties (Nightengale and Moncure 1996). Kenmotsu and Freeman (1980)
followed up and recorded eight prehistoric and three multicomponent sites in the countyâs southern
uplands. Brown and Kenmotsu (1980) reported on excavations at one of those sites, 41BP176, and
concluded that the site represented several intermittent occupations buried in a sandy terrace, with one
diagnostic artifact dating to the Late Prehistoric. Brown (1984) looked at another LCRA transmission line
corridor in Bastrop County, and found one prehistoric and one multicomponent site, neither of which
were felt to warrant avoidance or further work. Kotter (1980) surveyed a pipeline right of way for the Sim
Gideon Power Plant, and recorded two prehistoric sites, and again the sites were felt to not warrant
avoidance.
Nash et al. (1996) reported a survey by Espey, Huston &Associates of the T-150 Sim Gideon to
Smithville transmission line, and the area surveyed was approximately 9.43 miles, which is just over half
of the length of the nearby T-260 transmission line. The survey recorded four new sites and revisited four
previously recorded sites. EH&A found that all eight had prehistoric components, while three sites also
had historic components, and that four of the sites, 41BP427, 41BP428, 41BP465 and 41BP466, were felt
to be potentially eligible (of undetermined eligibility by todays terminology) for SAL or NHRP status. All
four of these sites were eventually ruled ineligible for NRHP status in 2005.
Robinson et al. (2001) describe a series of undertakings to complete a comprehensive cultural resources
survey within the modern boundaries of Camp Swift Army Base. Between a 1996 to 1997 survey
sponsored by the Adjutant Generalâs Department of Texas, and a 2000 resurvey of 28 sites and
geomorphological testing by the Center for Archaeological Research of the University of Texas at San
Antonio, it was concluded that there are 169 known sites within present day Camp Swift. Of these, one
site, 41BP138, is considered eligible for NRHP listing, 59 sites are considered âpotentially eligibleâ
(undetermined), and 106 sites were considered completely ineligible. It is worth noting that 41BP138 is a
multicomponent site consisting of a lithic scatter and the remains of a house and wine cellar from an early
Texas vineyard, and that the site was considered eligible for NRHP listing based on the historic vineyard
component, and not the prehistoric lithic scatter.
In subsequent years, LCRA Cultural Resources staff has conducted several brief surveys of transmission
lines in the area for varying transmission line maintenance projects. One of these (Hixson et al 2005)
128

included an attempt to relocate 41BP3, which is plotted just north of the transmission line near its north
end. Apparently the site was reported to archaeologists by artifact collectors, and is plotted in an
approximate location on the Sites Atlas. Shovel testing along the transmission line for the present project
failed to relocate the site, and its exact location remains unknown.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Prehistoric Background
The project area is within the Central Texas archaeological region as described variously by various
sources over the decades. The final version of this interim report will be within LCRAâs annual report of
investigations for 2016, which will have a substantial culture history section, and it will not be repeated
here.
Historic Background
Histories of several counties have been compiled by the LCRA staff for historic background information
(LCRA files). According to these records, Bastrop County was settled as early as 1804, when a fort was
established at the location of present day Bastrop, which was then a stop along the Nacogdoches-San
Antonio road. In 1827 Stephen F. Austin received a grant from the Spanish governor, and by 1830 the
town of Bastrop, named for the Baron de Bastrop, was settled. In 1837 the Republic of Texas established
the County of Bastrop. Cotton and lumber were primary industries, and by 1860 almost a third of the
population was slaves. Around 1870 industrial interests were expanding. By the turn of the century
railroads had helped to improve the economy, oil had been discovered, and a major brick manufacturing
plant was in place near Elgin. Camp Swift was established as a training center during World War II, and
in time housed a prisoner of war camp. By 1950 a diversified agricultural base was still the main
economic strength of the county. Agriculture has been Bastrop Countyâs mainstay until recently; as
nearby Austin has continued to grow, so has Bastrop. Many residents of Bastrop now commute on a daily
basis to the stateâs capital.
The majority of the project area is within the southern edge of the original Camp Swift, constructed in
1942 across some 50,000 acres (Robinson et al. 2001). The camp required condemnation of numerous
properties, and thousands of acres of land were cleared, which included the demolition of structures and
in some cases repurposing of building materials. It is telling that the 1936 Bastrop County highway map
illustrates dozens of structures near the project area, but post WWII maps show none at all. Following the
war the majority of the camp was declared to be surplus, and was sold back to various interests, and not
necessarily those who had been previously removed. The result is a greater-than-expected disconnect in
land tenancy, making connections to earlier landholdings less palpable.
In 2007, a final report was issued by the U.S. Army regarding evaluation and cost analysis of risk factors
associated with potential unexploded ordnance and other potentially hazardous materials in the former
Camp Swift (Parsons 2007). Included were map overlays showing various land uses during the operation
of the camp. Although the map legends are somewhat confusing, it appears that the portion of the camp
129

crossed by the transmission line was only lightly used, except for an artillery impact area towards the
northeast end.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODS
The project was designed to identify and assess known and unknown archaeological sites that are present
within the project area and that might be adversely impacted. Assessments result in recommendations to
the State Historic Preservation Officer as to any individual siteâs eligibility for formal listing as an SAL
and in this case, nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Prior to initiating field work a map and file review was conducted to identify high probability areas.
These were based primarily upon topography, hydrology, and locations of structures on historical maps.
Field work consisted of pedestrian survey of high probability areas coupled with subsurface (shovel)
testing when appropriate. Shovel tests were 30-40 cm in diameter and excavated in 20 cm increments
with all fill passed through one-quarter inch screen. Soils across the project area allowed shovel tests to be
routinely excavated to depths of 100 cm or more, and were terminated when they were too deep to dig
further or when subsoils, usually sandy clay, were encountered (Figure 46).
Records included shovel test logs, field notes, field forms, photographs and photograph logs, and GPS
logs. A no-collection policy was maintained throughout the project.

RESULTS
LCRA Cultural Resources staff conducted intensive cultural resources survey work on the T-260 line
from the Sim Gideon Power Plant to the Paige Split during several field visits from March 28th to April
7th, 2016. In the course of that work, seven new archaeological sites were recorded, and one previously
recorded site was retested and assessed. New sites consisted of 41BP942-41BP948. Sites 41BP94241BP946 and 41BP948 were all prehistoric, while previously recorded site 41BP811 and new site
41BP947 contained both prehistoric and historic components.

41BP942
Site 41BP942 sits on top of and off the edge of a high terrace to an unnamed creek drainage (Figure 56).
Soils are mapped as Padina fine sand over the Carrizo sand formation. The right of way is clear of all but
short grass and some short brushy vegetation, and it bordered by thick and tall pine growth to the
northwest, and pine growth that has been partially cleared for housing to the southeast. The site runs for
65 m along the right of way from the terrace edge, and extends across the 30 m right of way.
No cultural material was located on the lower terrace on either side of the drainage. Shovel testing
indicated that 41BP942 is a buried lithic scatter, though a few surface artifacts are present in the siteâs
northeastern portion. The subsurface material is primarily between 80 and 120 cm, and is sparse. Sandy
soils have likely allowed artifacts to descend over time. Material observed consisted primarily of burned
chert, hard and soft hammer flakes and flake fragments, and chert chips. While shovel test 12 did reveal a
small amount of glass and a pull tab, these recent materials are likely related to the occupied home
nearby.
Although a new transmission line structure is planned for placement on the edge of the terrace within the
site, staff feels that the impact of this structure in site 41BP942 would be minimal, due to the siteâs
condition. Because of poor stratification and apparent bioturbation and natural movement within the soils,
site 41BP942 holds very little research potential beyond its locational information, and is therefore
recommended as ineligible for formal SAL status within the right of way. Replacement of the
transmission line structure within the site be allowed to proceed without restrictions.

41BP943
Site 41BP943 sits on a rise straddled by two intermittent drainages (Figure 57). The slope is steeper to the
northeast than to the southwest. Soils are mapped as Padina fine sand of the Reklaw geologic formation.
The right of way is surrounded by primarily pine and post oak trees with short grass in the right of way.
While some of the pine trees are living, most are dead trunks left from the 2012 Bastrop fires. Water
draining along vehicle paths on the slope to the northeast has eroded a channel parallel to the transmission
line in the right of way. The site extends for approximately 115 m and across the 30 m right of way.

131

Site 41BP943 is a buried lithic scatter with some burned chert and quartzite. Cultural material is clearly
mixed, illustrated most clearly by the two diagnostic projectile points found in shovel tests 21 and 24.
Shovel test 21 revealed an Ensor dart point around 50 cmbs (Figure 51), while test 24 to the northeast
revealed a serrated Scallorn arrow point around 90 cmbs (Figure 52). In general, material appears to be
migrating down through the sandy soils towards a stable clay layer. For this reason, the origin of the
burned chert and quartzite present in shovel tests is questionable. While the central northeastern part of
the site seems to have the highest quantity of cultural material, consisting of debitage and burned rock, the
subsurface material abruptly ends at the sites periphery to the south, and decreases with distance to the
north. Both projectile points were unbroken, making the circumstances of their deposition curious. Site
41BP946, across the drainage to the northeast but at the same elevation, is similar in relative density,
though it lacks diagnostic artifacts.
Despite 41BP943âs diagnostic artifacts, severe bioturbation and soil mixing in the site have destroyed the
integrity of the sites deposits, and robbed it of its research value beyond locational data. It is therefore
recommended as ineligible for formal SAL status, and it is recommended that replacement of the
transmission line structure within the site be allowed to proceed without restrictions.

41BP944
Site 41BP944 sits on the lower terrace to an intermittent drainage (Figure 57). The soils are mapped as
Padina fine sand over the Reklaw geologic formation. The right of way is clear of most vegetation, and
contains primarily short grass and wildflowers, while the right of way is surrounded by pine trees, some
living, but mostly dead trunks left from the 2012 Bastrop fires. Another drainage runs to the northeast of
the site, cutting in between this terrace surface and the higher terrace surface to the northeast. The lower
terrace top where the site is located is relatively flat, and the site extends for about 50 m back from the
terrace edge, and across the 30 m right of way.
Site 41BP944 was discovered when a shovel test at a new structure location recovered several chert chips.
Subsequent testing along the right of way in 20 m intervals resulted in another test positive for chert chips
and this time a tertiary flake and some miscellaneous chert shatter, followed by two negative tests.
The site appears to be a sparse lithic scatter overlooking the two drainages. A lack of temporally
diagnostic artifacts and stratification, as well as the extremely sparse nature of this lithic scatter give the
site little in the way of research value.. For these reasons, 41BP944 is recommended as ineligible for
formal SAL status. It is also recommended that replacement of the transmission line structure within the
site be allowed to proceed without any restrictions.

Site 41BP945
Site 41BP945 sits atop a high ridge in between several drainages (Figure 57). It is a high terrace to Alum
Creek 260 m to the east, as well as a terrace to a small intermittent drainage to the southwest, and perhaps
formerly a terrace to the drainage on the other side of 41BP944. This land from is eroding in all directions
but north. Soils are mapped as Padina fine sand over the Reklaw geologic formation. The right of way is
vegetated with short grass, wildflowers, dewberry thickets and a few prickly pears. The northwest edge of
the right of way is populated with dense pine, oak, post oak, and hickory growth, while the southeast side
contains the same vegetation but is less dense. The site extends for 175 m across the top and slightly
down each side of the ridge, and across the 30 m right of way.
Site 41BP945 was immediately apparent because of surface artifacts located in pocket gopher backdirt
piles and across the slope in both directions of the right of way. Shovel testing revealed that the densest
deposits of cultural material exist in the siteâs center, and that subsurface material decreases from there in
both directions. Material observed included a variety of soft and hard hammer flakes, a possible
hammerstone, and some burned chert and quartzite. Material is exposed on the slopes because the top of
the ridge is eroding away. The ridge actually appears to be eroding in all direction but north, and the area
to the north may be more stable than the portion of the site presented in the right of way. The site also sits
on the same elevation as 41BP943, and the two sites are similar in relative artifact density and
composition.
Heavy bioturbation and mixing in the sandy soils has unfortunately destroyed any stratigraphy that may
have existed in this site. Lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts as well leaves this site with little research
value beyond its locational data. Site 41BP945 is for these reasons recommended as ineligible for formal
133

SAL status within the ROW, and it is recommended that the replacement of the transmission line
structure within the site be allowed to proceed without restrictions.

Site 41BP946
Site 41BP946 sits on the broad sloping terrace to Alum Creek (Figure 57). The site is about 100 m from
the closest segment of Alum Creek, and 250 m from the part that crosses the right of way. Site 41BP945
sits on the higher terrace to the southwest of the site. Soils across most of the site are Sayers fine sandy
loam, but the southwestern portion of the site is mapped at Padina fine sand. The entire site sits on the
Reklaw geologic formation. Short grass, wildflowers, dewberry, and other brushy plants grow in the right
of way, while the northwestern edge of the right of way is populated with dense pine, oak, post oak, and
hickory growth, and the southeast side contains the same vegetation but is less dense, especially
approaching the creek. The site runs for about 160 m along the transmission line, and spans the 30 m right
of way.
Site 41BP946 was discovered when a couple of flake fragments were observed in gopher backdirt piles.
Shovel testing from the edge of the terrace above the floodplain (only a slight hump in the slope) to the
area preceding the slope of the higher terrace revealed hard and soft hammer flakes, chert chips, a
possible hammerstone, and burned chert. While the material observed closer to the edge of the lower
terrace is certainly an independent site, material in the southwestern portion of the site could represent
more redeposition of artifacts from 41BP945 on the deflating terrace ridge line above. For this reason,
shovel testing was halted in that section of the site, and the boundary was drawn to represent location of
surface material in that area. The site is interpreted as a lithic scatter with some burned chert.
Pocket gophers, deflation, and natural soil mixing have led to poor stratigraphy in 41BP946, and lack of
temporally diagnostic artifacts leave this site with little research value beyond its locational data. Site
41BP946 is thus recommended as ineligible for formal SAL status. While current plans do not call for a
structure to be placed within the boundary of the site, it is also recommended that should construction
plans change, any transmission line construction activities during the T-260 rebuild project be allowed to
proceed within the siteâs boundary without restrictions.

41BP947
Site 41BP947 is located on a southwest facing slope overlooking an unnamed tributary to Alum Creek
110 m to the southwest (Figure 58). While the site appears to be on the first terrace of the creek in that
direction, an artificial soil berm (which was the basis for the siteâs southwestern boundary) runs along
what appears to be the first terrace edge. The site sits in a cleared pasture on the slope, surrounded on the
northwestern edge of the right of way and on the sides of the pasture in all other directions by dense pine
growth. Post oak also makes an appearance in the vegetation surrounding the pasture, but oak, Ashejuniper, and mesquite trees populate the pasture in small clumps. Otherwise, the pasture is filled with
shortgrass and wildflowers. Soils are mapped as Padina fine sand over the Reklaw geological formation.

134

The site spans 160 m along the slope (southwest to northeast), and 95 m from the edge of the clearing
towards the opposing tree line across the pasture (northwest to southeast).
Site 41BP947 was discovered when an area of the right of way was surveyed for remains of a structure
shown directly in the path of the T-260 transmission line on an 1899 USGS map of the area. Pedestrian
survey and shovel testing revealed both historic glass and crockery and prehistoric chips and a flake in the
right of way. A chimney fall was spotted about 70 m from the right of way (Figure 53, and informal
investigation revealed a cut sandstone hearth base with an associated scatter of local red bricks and white
fire bricks, and a variety of historic refuse, including aqua glass, brown glass, blue glass, patinated
window pane glass, salt glazed crockery, several pieces of a cast iron stove, a metal handsaw blade, and
whiteware. A stone-lined well was also discovered some 13 m to the south in a clump of trees. Chert
flakes and chips were observed on the surface and in shovel tests in the right of way across the site, and
are the basis for the siteâs northern boundary. Shovel testing was not conducted in portions of the site
outside of the right of way.

Figure 53. Chimney fall outside right of way at 41BP947.

A subsequent search of deed records at the Bastrop County courthouse, as well as federal census records,
has revealed the following ownership history of the property. The property on which 41BP947 sits was
originally part of a 3,100 acre property granted to an S. S. Beasley by the Republic of Texas in 1838.
While no date was found, a later deed explains that a Franklin Lewis purchased a part of that 3,100 acres,
and in 1886, Franklin Lewisâs heirs split his property between two of his sons, Alexander and L.G. Lewis.
These two men then exchanged some parts of the property again in 1887, and the land held by L.G. Lewis
was listed at 127.99 acres, the same size as the modern property. L.G., along with his wife Ida and their
four children, are believed to have resided on the property. While the circumstances of L.G.âs demise are

135

unknown, his wife Ida is shown as the widowed head of the household on the 1900 census, and in 1902,
Ida sold the property to a John C. Porter.
John Porter, an English immigrant with two Texas-born daughters, is shown in the 1900 census as a
widower who owned a farm free of mortgage. According to census records, Johnâs daughter Grace
married, while Bertha was shown as single and working as a postmaster, and boarding in the town of
Paige. By 1922, Bertha Porter is shown as the property owner in a lease agreement for a county road,
though the 1930 census records show her as a boarder in San Angelo, and still unmarried.
In 1942, the property was purchased by the U.S. Government during acquisition of property for the Camp
Swift Army Base. In 1950, Bertha Porter purchased the land back from the government (minus the rights
to any fissionable materials). Ms. Porter sold the property to a Mr. and Mrs. Mack in 1952, and later that
year, the property was sold to a Bruno Ernst, the grandfather of the current property owner, Mrs. Susan K.
Prihoda. A phone conversation with Mrs. Prihoda confirmed that Mr. Ernst was her grandfather, and that
her family had never lived on the property, but used it for agricultural activities.
The approximate age of the artifacts at the site would suggest late nineteenth or early twentieth century
occupation. This indicates that the house was very likely built or maintained by L.G. and Ida Lewis. Mr.
Porter and his daughters had another farm at the time of purchase, and Ms. Bertha Porter seems to have
boarded in cities most of her life. While it is possible that one or more of the Porters resided on the
property for a time, it seems unlikely that they built the structure in question.
The portion of 41BP947 that is contained in the right of way is sparse and lacking stratification. Heavy
bioturbation and natural movement within the sandy soils have also mixed the historic and prehistoric
components of the site. The prehistoric component is a sparse lithic scatter across the slope, and lacks
diagnostics and is mixed with the historic refuse. For this reason, 41BP947 is recommended as ineligible
for formal SAL status within the right of way, and it is recommended that replacement of the transmission
line structure in the site be allowed to proceed without restrictions.

41BP948
Site 41BP948 is located on a low terrace rise over a 700-m-wide floodplain formed by a tributary to Alum
Creek (Figure 59). The tributary has been dammed and there is a substantial private lake present. The site
is as far as 400 m from the stream channel. Soil are mapped as Padina fine sand over the Queen City sand
formation. The easement is cleared of vegetation other than various grasses, and is surrounded by post
oak woods to the south, while to the north the floodplain is largely open pasture.
The site was found while prospecting for a potential historic house seen on old maps in the vicinity of the
right of way. Shovel test 62 was excavated through clearly recent burned soil with charcoal which then
became pale brown sand. At about 80 cm fire-cracked sandstone was encountered. About 10 pieces of
rock ranging in size from about 5 to 15 cm and weighing a total of 1.3 km was recovered (Figure 54). A
single chip was also seen. These materials were immediately above wet, yellowish mottled sandy clay.
Test 63 was placed about 25 m to the southwest. A burned biface thinning flake was recovered from
136

between 60 and 80 cm and a potlid from the level below. The test was excavated to a depth of 110 cm
where orange clay mottling began.
Because no support structures are planned for the immediate area, shovel tests 64 and 65 were placed
about 140 m southwest and northeast, respectively, at proposed new structure locations. Shovel test 64
encountered sand to about 50 cm where yellow and orange mottled sandy clay was seen. Shove test 65
recovered one split chert cobble and a fire-cracked chert pebble from between 60 and 80 cm. These
materials are not conclusively cultural in origin. Mottled clay was once again present below sand.
Site 41BP948 may represent an open camp, however it is doubtful that the potential feature material is on
an old land surface. It is more probable that these materials were displaced vertically and settled at a
relatively steady rate until they rested upon the dense clay layer. The site is defined as extending to test 65
and ending somewhere between test 63 and 64, a distance of about 250 m. Because there will be no direct
impacts to any feature material, no further investigation was conducted. Given the nature of the remainder
of the sites that were documented, which consistently exhibit a lack of integrity due to extreme
bioturbation in the loose sandy soils, site 41BP948 is recommended as ineligible for formal SAL status
within the right of way.

41BP811
Site 41BP81 was recorded in 2006 during an LCRA transmission line right of way maintenance project.
At the time, a single shovel test recovered moderate amounts of fire-cracked rock and lithic debitage, and
the medial section of a dart pint was seen within a disturbed area. The site was recommended as having
undetermined SAL status.
137

The site is located on the outside bend of a deeply (c. 10 m) incised tributary of Alum Creek (Figure 58).
Although the transmission line crosses over the creek, the transmission line access follows the high bank
of the creek, so it does not restrict travel. Soils are mapped as Whitesboro clay loam, although soils
encountered at the site were clearly sand. The underlying geology is the Eocene-aged Reklaw formation.
The cutbank and the numerous rodent burrows and other exposures were examined for cultural material.
All that was seen was two or three pieces of fire-cracked rock, of uncertain origin, along the creek cut.
Three shovel test (47-49) were excavated, the first on the edge of the right of way near the top of a knoll
from which it previously had been hypothesized that prehistoric cultural material may have been
emanating from. It was excavated through 55 cm of sand over reddish sandy clay. A single small (5 cm)
burned rock was recovered from between 40 and 60 cm. The next test was placed immediately downslope
in the centerline of the easement, relatively near where the original 2006 test had been. A solarized bottle
neck was recovered from between 40 and 60 cm, and a crude, thick bifacially worked chert chunk was
recovered from 60 to 80 cm. This test was excavated through sand to a depth of 85 cm where clay was
encountered. The final test was placed on the terrace edge adjacent to the highest portion of the cutbank.
This test recovered a chip from 0-40 cm, two pieces of chert shatter from 40-80 cm, a flake and a chip
from 80-100, cm, and a live .30-06 round from 100-120 cm. The shell was stamped with marks
identifying it as produced in 1942 at the Des Moines Ordnance Plant. It was probably a result of military
activities at Camp Swift. The tests and other observations indicate the site is about 75 m in diameter.
Site 41BP811 did not live up to previous expectations. Prehistoric cultural material is minimal and mixed
with historical materials. The loose sands are not conducive to horizontal or vertical integrity. The site is
assessed as ineligible for formal SAL status within the right of way.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
None of the sites known to be within the T-260 corridor are recommended as eligible for state or federal
level listings. Their presence within loose, sandy, turbated soils minimizes any meaningful research
potential. There was no organic preservation noted, and historical artifacts were often located below
prehistoric artifacts. Prehistoric sites were located on ridges or lobes overlooking streams, and at times
quite distant from them. Most were just a few chips and flake fragments along with fire-cracked chert or
quartzite of inconclusive origin. It is therefore recommended the project be allowed to proceed as
described, with the understanding that emergency discovery procedure will be in place.
As an exercise, the TxDOT-sponsored HPALM model (Abbot 2013; Abbot and Pletka n.d.) was placed in
the project GIS and then joined with the site data. This was a post-survey experiment, and the HPALM
was not used for predictive modeling.
According to the HPALM, a number of GIS-linked variables can be layered and weighted to create an
integrity-based model that provides an opportunity to focus survey efforts on areas more likely to contain
significant, in the regulatory sense, prehistoric archaeological sites. While the author (Abbott)
acknowledges relatively severe limitations for the model in the Austin area, he argues that it is
âreasonably effective at identifying areas where eligible sites are unlikely to occurâ (Abbot and Pletka
2013:8). Other limitations include discounting sites on TPWD lands, due to a different significance
threshold associated with agencies tasked with preservation more than development. Given this, and other
constraints, the testing site population was whittled from some 22,000 sites to 68 eligible across the 11county study area.
The model, however, is focused on landform integrity, and classifies landscapes into 10 separate
categories, based on the potential for deep (> 1 m) and shallow (< 1 m) deposits (Table 6). The
âmoderateâ and âhighâ potentials (scores 5 and 9) are assumed here to mean for both shallow and deep
integrity. Table 7 illustrates the sites in the present project area and corresponding HPALM scores

Nine of the 10 sites have some portion in areas with HPALM scores of 5, two sites in areas with HPALM
score of 9, two in areas of negligible potential (scores of 1 or 2) and one each with scores of 3 or 4.
Remembering that the model does not explicitly predict the presence or absence of sites, but rather the
potential for there to be intact artifact-bearing deposits, the model does not seem to fare particularly well.
It might be expected that at least some of the sites with scores of 5 would have somewhat better
preservation than seen. The two sites that overlap areas with scores of 9 are not appreciably different in
setting or soils than the remainder (although 41BP811 is across a pronounced topographic break).
This small sample supports the provisos and cautions expressed in the HPALM documents, and
traditional behavioral modeling may be a better prospecting tool in this area.

Stream Crossings along the Sim Gideon-to-Paige Split portion of the T-260 Sim Gideon-toElgin Switch T-260 Rebuild Project
DRAFT Cultural Resource Assessment

Stream crossings and potential adjacent wetlands, where it is expected some sort of fill or other crossing
such as mats will be introduced to allow vehicular movement down the right of way, were assessed
separately from high probability areas, although in many cases these areas coincided. The crossing
locations were obtained from LCRA construction staff, then labeled for field assessment. Eleven
crossings were labeled 0-10, starting from near Sim Gideon and moving sequentially to near Paige Split
(Figure 60; Figure 61). Three additional potential crossings were identified in the field (7a, 11, and Alum
Creek) and were also assessed.
There is an existing access road under the entirety of the transmission line, and the existing streams have
been crossed regularly. At these locations there is typically a highly eroded road bed, often created by
past bulldozing, resulting in excellent visibility. The area between a crossing and the ordinary high water
mark, as evidenced by flood debris and/or topographic relief, was inspected visually, photographed, and if
warranted, shovel tested. In some cases, crossings are not mapped as streams on USGS quads, and are
instead side drainages that have become gullied, and, in the case of Crossing 7a, appear to be the result of
a recent, major flooding event.
The crossings are discussed individually, and are not necessarily jurisdictional waterways, nor are all
within mapped Houston toad habitat. The overall cultural resources survey primarily located prehistoric
sites on high sandy terraces overlooking streams. Apparently, streams in this area are too flood-prone to
support long term human occupation or preserve evidence of land use. None of the crossings was assessed
as potentially impacting significant (National Register of Historic Places or State Antiquities Codeeligible) sites.
Notably, the first mapped drainage out of Sim Gideon was not identified as requiring a crossing. This area
was examined on foot and determined to have a low probability for cultural resources. No shovel tests
were excavated.
Following a field assessment by consulting firm Blanton and Associates for delineation of jurisdictional
waters, three additional locations were identified. These are addressed at the end of this appendix and are
referred to as Waters A, B and C. While all but C were crossed during the field assessment, they were not
specifically addressed as potential crossings, and all three were in low probability areas for archaeological
sites.

Crossing 0
Crossing 0 is a north-trending erosional feature that may eventually join a short, unnamed tributary to
Lake Bastrop (Figure 62). The access road southwest of the crossing crosses a long sloping hillside with
excellent visibility within the road cut. On the northeast side there is a flat bench about 50 m from the
crossing. Shovel tests 3 and 4 were placed on this bench after two possible flakes and a few pieces of firecracked quartzite were observed on the ground surface. Both tests were excavated to a depth of 100 cm.
No artifacts were recovered. Because no cultural material was found in either test and because the flakes
were not conclusively cultural in origin, the area was not given a site designation. This crossing is
assessed as having no potential to impact significant cultural resource sites.

Crossing 1
Crossing 1 is a north-trending erosional feature about 65 m south of the mapped head of the drainage
mentioned above for Crossing 0 (Figure 63). The crossing is gently sloped on the northeast side and has a
more pronounced rise to the southwest. Visibility was variably excellent and no artifacts were observed.
Shovel test 5 was placed on the most promising portion of the landform, about 30 m southwest of the
lowest portion of the drainage. It was excavated through loamy sand to a depth of about 25 cm before a
brownish-yellow sandy clay was encountered. No artifacts were present. This crossing is assessed as
having no potential to impact significant cultural resource sites.

Crossing 2
Crossing 2 is across the head of an unnamed south-trending tributary of Alum Creek (Figure 64). To the
southwest the area is low-lying and of generally low probability for cultural resources. The northeast side
is somewhat more stable, with low terraces seemingly more conducive for intact archaeological sites.
Shovel test 8 was placed on the southwest side of the crossing about 30 m from its mapped intersection. It
was excavated to a depth of about 60 cm before sandy clay was encountered. Shovel test 9 was placed on
the edge of the first stable terrace above the stream (Figure 65). It was excavated to a depth of about 40
cm where gray and strong-brown sandy clay was encountered. Testing continued up the slope to the
northeast (tests 9, 10, 11) to where 41BP942 (discussed above) is located. Site 41BP942 is assessed as not
eligible for formal SAL or NR status and will not be impacted by the crossing. This crossing is assessed
as having no potential to impact significant cultural resource sites.

Crossing 3
Crossing 3 is at a south-trending drainage of Alum Creek (Figure 66; Figure 65). It is generally low-lying,
with eroded areas providing excellent visibility. Shovel tests (14 and 15) were placed near the stream at
higher elevations where replacement structures are located, about 140 m equidistant on either side. Both
of these tests were negative for cultural material. This crossing is consider fully investigated and as
having no potential to impact significant cultural resource sites.
146

Crossing 4
Crossing 4 is a highly eroded west-trending side drainage of the mapped stream described at Crossing 3
(Figure 67). The drainage has cut through the ground to underlying clay. Shovel test 17 was placed on the
southwest side of the drainage where there was a suggestion of a stable terrace. It encountered mottled
clay at about 50 cm. Due to the visibility and relatively steep slope on the northeast side no shovel tests
were attempted. This crossing is assessed as having no potential to impact significant cultural resource
sites.

Crossing 5
Crossing 5 is located at the confluence of south-trending Price Creek and a short unnamed tributary
(Figure 68). This is a highly eroded landform with excellent visibility. Price Creek fronts previously
recorded prehistoric archaeological site 41BP674 (discussed above and determined by THC to be
ineligible for NR status) to the northeast. No additional testing was attempted at this site. On the
southwest side three tests (18, 19, and 20) were placed in area of apparent stability. Test 18, located about
150 m from the crossing, resulted in recovery of two pieces of burned, non-cultural chert. The remaining
two tests were negative for cultural material and encountered sandy clay at depths of about 80 cm. This
crossing is assessed as having no potential to impact significant cultural resource sites.

Crossing 6
Crossing 6 is located across the low-lying gullied head of an unnamed south-trending tributary to Alum
Creek (Figure 69). It will likely only require mats for crossing. This was clearly an area of low probability
for archaeological sites, and no shovel tests were attempted. Site 41BP943 was recorded on higher ground
about 110 m to the northeast. This site is assessed as ineligible for formal SAL or NR status and will not
be impacted by any crossing activities. This crossing is assessed as having no potential to impact
significant cultural resource sites.

Crossing 7.
Crossing 7 is across a relatively substantial south-trending tributary of Alum Creek, although in the field
it was observed as probably crossable by mats. Shovel test 25 was placed on an apparent stable terrace on
the southwest side of the stream (Figure 70). It was excavated through 130 cm of strong brown sand and
encountered the water table at 105 cm. There was no recovery. Due to the sloping landform and excellent
visibility in erosional features, the first test to the northeast was placed about 90 m from the stream, where
prehistoric site 41BP944 (discussed above) was recorded. Site 41BP944 is considered ineligible for
formal SAL or NR status and will not be impacted by crossing activities. This crossing is assessed as
having no potential to impact significant cultural resource sites.

147

Crossing 7a.
Crossing 7a is an unexpected and unmapped south-trending tributary to Alum Creek, apparently formed
by a recent flood event, possibly due to blockage of the stream to the east (Crossing 8). A stratigraphic
profile in the bank indicates a lack of soil development (Figure 72). No artifacts were seen in the cuts or
any other surface exposures. Shovel tests 42 and 4 were placed about 45 m northeast and 25 m southwest,
respectively. Both encountered clay at depths below 50 cm. No artifacts were encountered. This crossing
is assessed as having no potential to impact significant cultural resource sites.

Crossing 8
Crossing 8 is a mapped south-trending drainage of Alum Creek that may not be crossable (Figure 73).
Shovel test 38 was placed on the high bank on the northeast side, about 20 m from the stream (Figure 74).
It encountered sandy clay at a depth of about 40 cm. Shovel test 45 was placed about 70 m southwest of
the stream (the low side). This test encountered mottled brown sand below 45 cm. Test 39 (not illustrated)
was placed about 95 m northeast of the stream and encountered red clay below 20 cm. No artifacts were
found in any of the tests. This crossing is assessed as having no potential to impact significant cultural
resource sites.

Crossing 9
Crossing 9 is across a broad, low-lying drainage that meanders in a southeasterly direction towards Alum
Creek. This area may be crossable by mats. Shovel tests 51 and 52 were placed as near the crossing as
topography allowed (25 m to the southwest and 45 m to the northeast, respectively). Test 51 encountered
gleyed sandy clay below 60 cm, and test 52 encountered heavily mottled sand below 20 cm. No artifacts
were recovered or otherwise observed. This crossing is assessed as having no potential to impact
significant cultural resource sites.

Crossing 10
Crossing 10 is across a broad, low-lying west-trending stream that feds a large artificial lake which is part
of the Alum Creek drainage system (Figure 75). An unmapped smaller drainage is located about 30 m to
the southwest and has the appearance of a wetland. The existing road crossing the stream indicates
shallow soils over clay, and cow trails and rodent backdirt piles showed no artifacts. This area may be
crossable by using mats. Although this area is of low probability for intact cultural resources, a single
shovel test (67) was placed between the potential wetland about 10 m southwest of the mapped stream.
The test encountered saturated, mottled and striated flood deposits and was terminated at 50 cm in dark
brown clay. No artifacts were encountered. Test 66 was placed about 100 m northeast of the stream on the
terrace above the floodplain at the location of a new support structure. It was excavated to a depth of 120
cm through brown sand. Five pieces of chert shatter were seen between 40 and 100 cm, although none
were clearly of cultural origin. Notably, a piece of concrete, almost certainly from the existing lattice
148

tower at that location, was also recovered from between 80 and 100 cm. Test 65 was placed about 200 m
to the southwest, where the broad floodplain rises to the next terrace edge. It encountered potential
cultural material (a split cobble and fire-fractured pebble) in sand at about 70 cm. Below this was mottled
yellow and orange sandy clay. This area will not be impacted by crossing activities. This crossing is
assessed as having no potential to impact significant cultural resource sites.

Crossing 11
Crossing 11 is a well-defined but shallow side drainage that feeds a north-trending tributary to Springs
Creek (Figure 76). It is not mapped as a stream and may be crossable by mats. It is in the vicinity of
poorly-defined 41BP3 (see Previous Investigations section). Shovel tests 69-70 were placed on either side
of the drainage. Test 68 was placed about 30 m south of the crossing near the existing lattice structure.
One possible flake or core fragment was found between 20 and 40 cm in gravelly, brown sandy loam over
strongly mottled clay encountered at about 50 cm. Test 69 was placed about 20 m to the northeast of the
drainage and encountered black clay over strongly mottled orange and yellow clay with cobbles at about
25 cm. Given the possible positive recovery from test 68, test 70 was placed about 30 m further to the
southwest. It was excavated through 40 cm of brown loamy sand before sandy orange clay was seen. This
crossing is assessed as having no potential to impact significant cultural resource sites.

Alum Creek
The transmission line crosses Alum Creek where a side flood channel (possibly an old oxbow) joins the
main channel, forming an island on which a structure is located (Figure 77). This area is not identified as
a formal crossing, but may require matting to remove and possibly replace the existing structure. The
vicinity of the stream channel is low-lying and clearly flood prone, and therefore has a very low
probability of containing intact cultural materials. Shovel test 40 was placed about 70 m northeast of the
side channel. It encountered sandy clay below about 70 cm. Shovel test 37 was placed about 75 m to the
southwest of the main creek channel (Figure 78). It was located on a sideslope overlooking a mapped
âmarsh or swampâ where a few pieces of fire-cracked quartzite were observed, but nothing definitively
cultural. The adjacent access road exposures and numerous rodent burrows did not evidence any cultural
material, and the low-lying landform is not conducive to site preservation. This crossing is assessed as
having no potential to impact significant cultural resource sites.

Waters A
This is an apparent gully on a side slope southwest of Crossing 2 (Figure 79). It received windshield
survey during the assessment of Crossing 2 (see above) and is within 100 m of shovel test 8. Furthermore,
no crossings will be needed at this location. There will be no impacts to potential significant cultural
resource sites at this location.

149

Waters B
This is an apparent side drainage to the drainage described for Crossing 10 (Figure 80). It is an area
determined to be of low probability for cultural materials, although it received windshield survey. It is
within 120 m of shovel test 60. There will be no need for a crossing at this location. There will be no
impacts to potential significant cultural resource sites at this location.

Waters C
This is a large pond at the far northeastern portion of the project area (Figure 81). No cultural resource
field assessments were conducted in this low probability area. Furthermore, there will be no crossings of
this pond. There will be no impacts to potential significant cultural resource sites at this location.

Project 15.16: Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of LCRAâs Proposed Blewett Electrical
Substation Relocation Project, Uvalde County, Texas

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) proposes to construct a new electrical substation and
access road on approximately 11.71 acres in southwestern Uvalde County (Figure 82). The substation will
be located adjacent to existing LCRA transmission line T-570. The substation will be accessed by a short
section of new road and by widening an existing private ranch road that follows the transmission line for
about 1.2 km before entering the substation site. Additionally, there will be a 2-3-foot-deep narrow trench
within the transmission line easement that will be used to route a fiber optic line from the highway to the
new substation site. This substation is a redesign and relocation of one that was proposed in 2015 (Malof
2015).
A cultural resources assessment consisting of a map and file review followed by field survey was
conducted by LCRA Cultural Resources staff on April 13 and 14, 2016. Three previously unrecorded
prehistoric sites, Sites 1-3, were documented (Figure 83). All three are lithic scatters with fire-cracked
rock of uncertain origin. Due in large part to a highly disturbed landscape, only one small portion of
41UV501 is considered to possibly have interpretable remains, in the form of a burned rock zone found in
a shovel test at a depth of about 50 cm. However, a lack of organic material or tools of any type severely
limit the research utility. Therefore, none of the sites are recommended as being eligible for formal State
Antiquities Landmark status within the project area.
The project was conducted under the terms of LCRAâs 2016 blanket permit 7531 in accordance with the
Memorandum of Understanding between LCRA and the Texas Historical Commission, which
incorporates Council of Texas Archeologists survey standards. This interim report will be presented in
final form within LCRAâs annual report of cultural resource investigations for 2016. There is no known
or anticipated federal funding or permitting for this project.
No artifacts were collected during the project; project records will be submitted to an accredited curation
facility. It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is located within the Texas-Tamaulipan Thrornscrub portion of the Tamaulipas-Texas
Semiarid Plain, which is part of the Southern Texas Plains (Griffith et al. 2007). More specifically, it is
described as interior plains and hills with xerophytic shrub and oak forest within an ecotone formed by
the Chihuahuan Desert, Tamaulipan thornscrub and subtropical woodlands and coastal grasslands. Oncewidespread grasslands have been replaced by scrub due to grazing, fire suppression and drought. Much of
the land has been used historically for grazing.
Geologically, the project area is within the Anacacho limestone formation, a Late Cretaceous area of
limestone and marl covered with Quaternary colluvium, alluvial gravel, and sand. Holocene deposits are
not mapped in the project area (Stoesser et al. 2015). Soils are mapped as undulating Olmos and Ector

series at the substation location, and Uvalde silty clay loam along the northern half of the access road, and
there is a small area of Valera silty clay (Soil Survey Staff 2015). Ector soils are very shallow stony soils
formed in loamy residuum, and encounter limestone bedrock at a depth of about 45 cm. The undivided
Olmos soils are very similar but tend to be found over caliche. Uvalde soils are very deep soils formed on
terraces on piedmont alluvial plains, although the A horizon is limited to about 40 cm, resting over
successive Bk horizons. Valera soils formed in clayey slope alluvium derived from limestone.
Topographically, the substation site is 200 m from the mapped bank of Turkey Creek, part of a major
stream system eventually feeding the Nueces River. A contour dip corresponds with a mapped geologic
fault, with the substation on the downthrust side, suggestive of groundwater availability. Anecdotally,
springs are present in the area.
Observed conditions showed alternating areas of shallow stony soils (Ector/Olmos) with largely purple
sage cover in relatively upland settings, with Uvalde silty clay loam covered with dense secondary
mesquite growth (Figure 84). Numerous bulldozer push piles are present, and the majority of the
transmission line corridor is shared by an improved, caliche-based road that is intensively used by haul
trucks from the nearby asphalt mines.

transitions to mesquite woods.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
While there are nearly 500 recorded archaeological sites in Uvalde County, very few have been recorded
in the vicinity of the project area. The nearest, 41UV450, is less than 1,000 m to the south at the Turkey
167

Creek crossing of Hwy 2022. The site is described as a lithic procurement locale where the raw material
benefitted greatly from heat treatment. A bit further to the south is 41UV129, an upland exposure of
limestone bedrock with an anthropomorphic petroglyph. Some 8 km to the east are sites 41UV6 and
41UV36, both along the headwaters of a minor tributary of the Nueces River. Site 41UV6 consisted of a
few crude bifaces and other minimally worked tools found at the bottom of a dry watering hole. Site
41UV36 was similar, with a few crude tools in Uvalde gravels.
A cultural resources survey was conducted by Hicks and Company for an LCRA transmission line
running between Del Rio and Uvalde, which included the section that will tie in to the proposed
substation (Miller at al. 2003). The present project area was considered to be low probability and was not
assessed. The survey resulted in the recording of 41UV438 at the Nueces River to the east, and 41UV439
and 41UV440 along Turkey Creek to the northwest. Site 41UV438 was a low density lithic scatter with
possible burned rocks and an apparent hearth. Shovel testing was inconclusive for portions of the site, and
it is of undetermined eligibility status. Sites 41UV439 and 41UV440 were both early twentieth century
trash scatters, and were determined to be ineligible for formal SAL status.
The previous iteration of the Blewett substation was located about one mile to the southwest along the
same transmission line. This project, which was never initiated, resulted in the recording of 41UV499,
which had a few chert artifacts including unifaces, occasional fire-cracked rock, and a historic trash
scatter. The trash was apparently associated with the former town of Blewett, and according to the
landowner, an actual town dump. The site was assessed as ineligible for SAL status Malof 2015).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The project area is within the South Texas archaeological region, near its juncture with the Lower Pecos
region (Hester 1995). A regional chronology has been difficult to attain, given the largely surficial nature
of the data and lack of vertical stratification. In general though, the prehistoric cultural chronology
follows that of Central Texas and the Lower Pecos, with Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric sites present. This information is covered in detail within the final report that this interim
report will be submitted with.
Uvalde County was named for the Spaniard Juan de Ugalde, who fought Indians in northern Mexico and
Texas in the late eighteenth century (Ochoa 2015a; Starnes 2015). The county was largely unoccupied
until the 1840s, when Fort Inge was established and the road between San Antonio and the Rio Grande
became well-traveled. Indian depredations remained common through the 1850s, and a Wild West
mentality was common throughout the Civil War and reconstruction. Ranching remained the primary
means of making a living, although successful irrigated farms began appearing. Mining of asphalt was
another important industry, making use of bituminous limestone. The county seat was home to John
Nance Garner, who served two terms as vice president to Franklin Roosevelt. Uvalde County has had a
very high percentage of Mexican-Americans, and civil rights issues came to a forefront in the early 1970s.
Ranching, farming and mining remain principal economic drivers.

168

The former community of Blewett is just south of the project area. Blewett was originally known as
Carbonville, probably a company town of the Lathe Carbon Company that in 1888 attempted to extract
bitumen for paint and varnish products (Ochoa 2015b). This unsuccessful operation was followed, in
1912, by an operation that developed limestone asphalt, and was organized by John Blewett Smyth. Also
known as Mine No. 2, Blewett peaked in production in 1927, and by 1940 was in decline. Despite this,
the population in the area may have been as high as 500 when the mines were fully operational.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODS
The project was designed to identify any archaeological resources present within the project area and
assess their potential for listing as State Antiquities Landmarks. The assessment consisted of a map and
file review followed by a formal field survey. The project area was transected by pedestrian survey
coupled with shovel testing. Twenty-seven shovel tests were excavated, which exceeds the number
suggested for a project of this size. Records included GPS and shovel test logs, photographs and field
notes.
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Three sites were recorded, all on relatively low ground near swales that act as minor tributaries to Turkey
Creek. Higher elevations to the northeast and in the central portions of the project area were covered with
shallow, rocky soils, and no sites were recorded in those settings (Figure 85).

Figure 85. Profile view of project area derived from DEM imagery. Sites 41UV501â41UV503 are
illustrated from left to right.
41UV501
Site 41UV501 is located on the southeastern portion of the substation site, primarily on the southern side
of a low draw that drains toward Turkey Creek, which is about 200 m to the southwest. The sites is about
100 m in diameter. It is within Uvalde silty clay loam that covers the mesquite-filled portion of the
substation site (Figure 86). The site is defined by 15 shovel tests, eight of which (1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14)
were positive for cultural material. Recovery was minimal (e.g. a single chert chip) to moderate, and in
the case of test 12, the test was halted when possible feature material (fire-cracked limestone) was
encountered. About 17 pieces weighing between 2 and 3 kg were recovered, and more was seen within
the edge and below the bottom of the test. A few pieces of chert debitage were also observed. The
169

remainder of the positive tests had no suggestion of intact cultural materials and were rarely deeper than
50 cm before dense gravels were struck. Notably, no tools or organic material was observed in any of the
shovel tests, other than a few Rabdotus and Polygyra species snails.
Aerial imagery from 2004 shows the site area as heavily wooded in 2004, then largely cleared by 2010,
and presently in state of regrowth. The present road used by heavy trucks was completed sometime
between 2010 and 2012.
The site is interpreted as a largely diffuse and mostly heavily disturbed portion of a prehistoric campsite
that is probably denser to southwest, closer to Turkey Creek. Overall, any research potential appears to be
low within the project area. Site 41UV501 is recommended as ineligible for formal SAL status, although
the area around shovel test 12 will have no direct construction-related impacts.

Figure 86. Site 41UV501, general environment, looking northeast
41UV502
Site 41UV502 is located on the sloping southeastern side of the high stony divide between the substation
site and the highway. It is separated from 41UV503 by a low, short draw that drains into Turkey Creek,
which is about 230 m southwest of the right of way. The site is defined by two shovel tests (18, 22)
located about 250 m apart. It is equally within Uvalde silty clay loam to the southeast and Valera silty
clay to the northwest. The site crosses and then is almost entirely within the road, as well as a large, road
base-covered turnout (Figure 87). The northwestern portion of the site terminates in the shallow, rocky
soils of the upland divide.

170

Shovel test 19, located on the lower portion of the site, recovered a single chert chip in the upper 20 cm,
then two 8-cm fire-cracked rocks in the next 20 cm. Shovel test 22, on the far side of the road and
turnaround, found seven 10-cm fire-cracked rocks between 20 and 40 cm, then a single 10-cm firecracked rock and a piece of chert shatter in the next 20 cm.
The site is interpreted as a minor lithic scatter with some burned rock of questionable origin. There was
no structure associated with the rock, in other words, no appearance of an intact feature, and its presence
may be due to colluvial redeposition from the higher elevation. The site is recommended as ineligible for
formal designation within the project area.

Figure 87. Central portion of 41UV502 looking northeast toward hill crest.
41UV503
Site 41UV503 is immediately to the southeast of 41UV502, on the opposite side of the low drainage
(Figure 88). Soils are mapped as Uvalde silty clay loam. The site is defined by three positive shovel tests
(16, 18, 21) that span about 90 meters. A road bisects the site, which is partially within open grassland
and partially within dense mesquite scrub.
The site was identified by a light surface scatter of chert debitage, including at least three pieces of a
similar, non-patinated white chert, as well as sparsely scattered fire-cracked rock. These materials were
on an open, relatively sandy patch of ground. Shovel test 16, which was placed at this location, was
excavated to 80 cm and recovered a total of 10 pieces of debitage and two fire-cracked rocks. A test to the
southeast was negative. Test 18 recovered a single hard-hammer thinning flake from 20-40 cm, and two
10-cm fire-cracked rocks from 40-60 cm. Test 21, nearest the draw, recovered seven 10-cm fire-cracked
rocks from 20-40 cm, and a single 10-cm fire-cracked rock and piece of chert shatter from the next 20 cm.
171

As with the majority of the burned rocks from the project area, there was no suggestion of an intact
feature, and its origin is questionable. 41UV503 is recommended as ineligible within the project area.

Discussion
The three archaeological sites that were recorded are very similar, consisting of small amounts of
chipping debris and incidental shatter, as well as a relative abundance of fire-cracked limestone. The
burned rocks are also commonly seen across the surface, where there is enough visibility. Repeated land
clearing events, as evidenced by numerous bulldozer pushpiles and probably accomplished by chaining
and root-plowing at various times, has severely impacted the majority of the project area. The origin of
the fire-cracked rock is unknown, and could be a mixture of prehistoric and historical events. Its
distribution, with the possible exception of shovel test 12 at 41UV501, gives no indication of intact
cultural deposits.
This type of environment is one where chances are good that a close enough examination of any given
area would result in identifying prehistoric or potential prehistoric material. It is telling the higher, stony
portions of the project area did not produce enough artifacts to warrant site designations. The presence of
burned rocks could not be quantified as being of prehistoric origin.
The sites do, however, point to the very likely probability of intact, denser sites closer to the creek, which
appears consistently well-watered, based on various aerial images, as well as observation from the road

172

crossing south of the project area. The challenge would be in finding any pockets of undisturbed soil in
this highly dynamic landscape.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A cultural resources assessment of LCRAâs proposed Blewett Substation and access road project resulted
in the recording of three prehistoric archaeological sites, 41UV501, 41UV502, and 41UV503. With the
possible exception of shovel test 12 at 41UV501, none exhibit integrity or diversity of materials that
would warrant further work. The potential feature at shovel test 12, in the opinion of the principal
investigator, does not warrant consideration as a formal State Antiquities Landmark. The area, however,
will be avoided by construction impacts.
LCRA therefore recommends the project be allowed to proceed as described, with the understanding that
emergency discovery protocols will be in place.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
LCRAâS Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area consists of approximately 860 acres of designated parkland and
another 414 acres of lands subject to inundation and/or that are contiguous to the park (Figure 89). It is
bisected by the Travis/Burnet County line and is on the south side of Lake Travis, which is formed by the
Colorado River. Originally 1,467 acres in size, 193 acres have been sold at various times, leaving 1,274
acres of land under LCRAâs control. At present there are 44 known archaeological sites on the property
that span most of the prehistoric period as well as historic settlement and use dating back perhaps to the
1850s. The property is notable for its association with Turner Farm, a tenant farming complex operated
from about 1890 to the 1930s, when LCRA acquired the land.
The property has had a number of projects requiring cultural resource assessments and surveys, beginning
in the late 1970s for brush clearing and fence construction, then again in the 1990s and continuing
through recent years as part of a program of inventory assessments for LCRA properties and proposed
improvements. A number of these later investigations resulted in the collection of select artifacts, which
have been temporarily stored at LCRA offices. This report is one in a series that accompanies artifacts
being permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.
While not intended for regulatory clearance on any particular project, the report does offer
recommendations for each of the known sites. The document can therefore be used as guidance for future
projects, which can reference the recommendations to identify potential constraints, assess interpretive
value or address broader research questions.
The report is rather traditionally organized, although site descriptions have been grouped by type and
component. This moves, somewhat, the focus from the individual site to broader implications of land use
and resource management, and therefore takes on something of a landscape perspective.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area is located within the Edwards Plateau Section of the Great Plains
physiographic province (Carr 1969:3) and is a part of a northeast-to-southwest-trending terrace that is
situated within a large bend of the Colorado River. A 2006 in-house land management plan (LCRA
2006:14-16) provides information on three environmental/topographic zones present at the park. Data on
these three zones â lowland/floodplain, upland margins, and uplands â is summarized in the next three
paragraphs.
The lowland/floodplain zone extends from the top of the original bank of the Colorado River at an
elevation of 620 ft above mean sea level (amsl) up to 700 ft (amsl). Most of this zone is normally
inundated by the conservation pool level of 681 ft amsl of Lake Travis. Detailed mapping of the river
basin undertaken just prior to the construction of the lake indicates that, within the park area, the
lowland/floodplain terrace is as wide as 950 to 1,950 ft in some areas. The zone consists of deep alluvial
terrace deposits (Barnes 1981). During times of low lake levels, staff examined cutbanks that indicate that
this terrace has 40-ft-deep alluvial deposits in some areas adjacent to the river channel.
181

The upland margins extend from about 700 to 800 ft amsl. In many parts of the park, the base of the
upland margins is marked by moderately steep slopes that rise abruptly from the inner edges of the
lowland/floodplain. The surfaces of the upland margins are draped with Pleistocene-era fluviatile terrace
deposits (Barnes 1981). These terrace deposits are generally less than 4 ft in thickness and include large
volumes of lag gravels.
Topographically, the upland zone extends from 800 ft amsl upward. Upland surfaces have little to no
topsoil. Outcrops of Cow Creek Limestone and Hammett Shale are frequently evident on the ground
surface in upland areas, as are surface exposures of Pleistocene lag gravel deposits (Barnes 1981).
An in-depth discussion of soil types occurring on Muleshoe Bend is difficult, as the current surveys of the
area are split by the Burnet-Travis County line, which bisects the bend (Figure 90). While soils that cross
the county line are mapped as continuous units, soils are mapped as different types on either side of the
line. On the Burnet County side (the western portion of the bend), the soils are mapped as BracketPurves-Doss soils (Dittemore and Allison 1979). The primary soil type in this association is Brackett
soils, at 37%, followed by Purves, Doss, Bolar, Eckrant, Krum, and Real soils, respectively. On the Travis
County side (the eastern portion), the soils are mapped as Brackett Association (Werchan et al. 1974).
Brackett soils make up 63% of this association, followed by Tarrant, Volente, Denton, San Saba,
Pedernales, and Altoga soils, again respectively. These soils are close in description most of the time, but
a discussion of the general soil types on either side of the county gives a picture of the soils that is just as
informative, and less confusing.
Brackett-type soils, which seem to make up much of the upland area of Muleshoe Bend, are described
varyingly as 5 or 6 inches of light brownish gray to paly brown clay loam, over either 12 inches of very
pale brown clay loam, or 9 inches of light yellowish brown clay loam, followed by either more pale
brown clay loam or pale yellow clay loam with scattered limestone chunks and calcium carbonate. The
lowlands around the lake and down to the inundated Colorado River seem to be uniformly shown as
loamy fine sands above clay loam and sandy clay in some places, and sandy loams with gravels above
sandy clay and clay loam in others. While other soil types occur in several place across the bend, most of
the bend can be described by one of these three common profiles.
Vegetation found on the alluvial terraces consists of a predominantly herbaceous community that includes
Bermuda grass, switchgrass, and eastern gamagrass with some buttonbush and mesquite trees. Post oak,
live oak, and Buckleyâs yucca, cowpen daisy, Texas croton, and wooly croton are also found on these
terraces.
In the upland margins, dense thickets of Ashe juniper are the predominant vegetation along with some
live oak, post oak, and mesquite trees. Shrub species including agarita, hog plum, prickly pear, brasil,
Texas persimmon, twist-leaf yucca, and mountain laurel are very common. In some areas, especially at
the locations of former historic house sites, white bush, tasajillo, and prickly pear are very dense.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
In the 1930s, when archeologists conducted a reconnaissance survey of the Lake Travis basin prior to the
construction of Mansfield Dam, one archeological site, 41TV250, was recorded in the Muleshoe Bend
tract. Jackson (1938) described it as a small prehistoric campsite with shallow deposits. No excavation
work was recommended at that time. In 1979, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. recorded 16 additional cultural
resource sites in advance of a proposed LCRA brush control project (Prewitt and Kotter 1979). These
consist of sites 41BT147 and 41BT148 in Burnet County and sites 41TV495 through 41TV508 in Travis
County. Site 41TV250 was also revisited during that investigation. In all, Prewitt and Associates recorded
13 prehistoric sites, 3 historic sites, and 1 multi-component site that is primarily historic, but includes a
small amount of prehistoric material. Most of the prehistoric sites were described as upland lithic scatters
and lithic procurement areas. Only four of the prehistoric sites were described as having campsite
materials. The historic period sites all appeared to be former late nineteenth to early twentieth century
house sites. Although the houses had been removed, surface features including cisterns, foundation
stones, rock walls, and root cellars were still evident. In summarizing the historic sites, Utley (1996:64)
later noted that of the four historic sites recorded by Prewitt and Kotter, 41TV499 and 41TV507 appeared
to be the most stable and least damaged. Overall, Prewitt and Kotter (1979) recommended avoidance of
13 of the prehistoric and historic sites during the proposed brush clearing program.
Additional cultural resource survey work was conducted by LCRA archaeological staff intermittently
from 1995 through. Staff investigations in the 1995â1997 era primarily focused on historic period house
sites in conjunction with Utleyâs (1996) historical research. Other fieldwork that focused on prehistoric
sites was conducted during droughts when areas normally covered by the lake were exposed. All of these
investigations were primarily reconnaissance level work, and importantly, did not include any shovel
testing or other types of subsurface probing. There was one survey with subsequent monitoring conducted
in 1995 for composting toilets being installed at 41TV500 and near 41TV495, but surface survey and
monitoring results were both negative (Nightengale et al 1997).
In 2005 and 2006, several surveys were conducted for construction projects at T-Bar-M, a privately-run
camp leased from LCRA. Site 41TV2255 was recorded at this time. LCRA Cultural Resources staff again
took advantage of the low water conditions to monitor several sites along the old Colorado River channel.
Unfortunately, the low water conditions also allowed vandals to damage site 41TV1342, a burned rock
midden at the mouth of Red Bluff Creek. While inspecting the damage, some fragments of large faunal
remains, possibly bison, were collected.
In 2007 and 2008, several surveys including collection were conducted at Muleshoe Bend. These surveys
were part of a capital improvements plan for the Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area, which was reported to
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in the LCRA Annual Report of Cultural Resource Investigations
for 2008. These surveys also took advantage of low water conditions to survey normally inundated sites
along the original Colorado River channel.
From 2009 to 2013, surveys were conducted as time allowed to monitor the cultural resources of
Muleshoe Bend. Several surveys were conducted to take advantage of low water conditions to examine
terraces along the original Colorado River channel at sites such as 41TV1910 and 41TV1911. The only
185

survey not associated with inventory monitoring during this time occurred at site 41BT343 in November
2012, when the Ridge Harbor neighborhood on the west side of Muleshoe Bend considered moving some
marina slips due to low water conditions.
Due to the sporadic nature of the inventory surveys, the results were not documented as systematically as
might be ideal. As a result, some sites were visited at different times by different teams, and it was not
always clear if a site was being revisited or recorded for the first time. In some cases, intermittent
inundation had dramatically altered a siteâs appearance or visibility, and site descriptions and boundaries
changed based on field notes and GPS points during post-processing. Additional assessments of many of
these sites are certainly warranted.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

Prehistoric Background
The prehistoric background is typical of the Texas Hill Country. The interested reader is invited to see the
introductory portion of this annual report, and to explore numerous other resources.
Historic Background
Most of the historic background information in the following paragraphs is taken from Utleyâs (1996)
previous historical study of the Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area. A number of local area residents,
including some who lived within the Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area on the historic tenant farms as
children, were interviewed by Utley.
The land on the bend was originally part of three land grants from the Republic of Texas. The land from
the county line to the western edge of the bend was granted to an Isaac Calvet, the land on the eastern
edge in Burnet County was granted to a Fedele Secholzer, and the land in between was granted to an
Allison Williams (suspected to be male). Records obtained from the Texas Land Office via the Original
Texas Land Survey indicate that, after receiving these properties in the late 1840s and early 1850s, all
three original grantees sold them almost immediately. What follows in the records available through the
land office is a short trail of transfers and surveys that seem to indicate that the land was subject to land
speculation, and there is no indication that any of the owners ever resided on the properties.
Although some undocumented historic period activities may have occurred earlier, it was not until the
1870s that sustained settlement of the area began. Muleshoe Bend has traditionally been considered to be
a part of a dispersed, rural community called Haynie Flat, established in 1879 (Thompson and Frasier
1996:38). While this community did not have a commercial center, there was at least one cotton gin in
operation in the early twentieth century (41TV1778). The real focal point of the community was the local
school and nearby cemetery, which are located about 2 miles south of the park. The one-room school was
started in the 1870s and offered only seven or eight grades. Nearby Spicewood High School allowed
students to complete their educations.
186

At Muleshoe Bend, George S. Turner, a prominent rancher, started a sharecropping farm operation in the
late nineteenth or early twentieth century. Following his death in 1903, his granddaughter, Laura
Penelope âNellaâ Turner Evans, inherited this land and oversaw the farm operations until she sold the
land to the LCRA in 1939. Today, the descendants of some of the sharecropper families who were tenants
on the Turner Farm still live in the vicinity of Muleshoe Bend Park. The locations and family names of
the occupants of five tenant farm houses are shown on a 1936 era contour map made by LCRA land
surveyors of the then proposed Lake Travis basin (Figure 91).
The archeological remains of six tenant farmsteads and two unrelated owner-occupied farmsteads are
among the cultural resource sites within the Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area. All houses and outbuildings
at five of these sites were deliberately removed by LCRA when it purchased the Turner Farm over 70
years ago. LCRA allowed one of the farmsteads to remain occupied into the 1950s, and then demolished
that house and its associated outbuildings. In some cases, underground cement-lined cisterns, root cellars,
trash dumps, portions of barbed wire fences, and remnants of house foundations are still discernable at
these sites. Limited numbers of artifacts such as metal fragments and broken glass and ceramics are also
visible on ground surface at the sites.
Cotton farming and its accompanying tenant farming system waned in the 1930s and 1940s across Texas,
at approximately the same time that LCRA was purchasing the Turner Farm to become a part of its Lake
Travis lands. In adjacent areas not bought by the LCRA, cattle ranching became the predominant
economic activity in the following decades along with land leasing for deer hunting. In more recent years,
many areas adjacent to Muleshoe Bend Park have been subdivided for rural residency with most
occupants either retirees or workers who commute to and from Austin each day.

METHODOLOGY
This report summarizes over 40 years of semi-continuous work at LCRAâs Muleshoe Bend Recreation
Area and contiguous lands. It therefore relies on notes, forms, reports, and other records created at various
times for various purposes (including differing survey intensities), as well as a deep institutional
knowledge of the property. Of the 44 known sites (Figure 92), 15 have been formally assessed by the
Texas Historical Commission as âineligible,â either in their entirety or within a specific project area. One
site, 41TV495, is formally assessed as undetermined, and one site assessed as ineligible is considered by
LCRA to contain undetermined components (41TV504). A large number of the remainder are considered
to be of undetermined status for regulatory purposes (Table 8). LCRA cultural resources department,
however, uses a five-point rating scale: 5-not eligible; 4-unknown eligibility; 3-potentially significant; 2significant; 1-listed, where some sites are clearly not eligible (5), others (3 and 4) need varying amounts
of work to clarify eligibility, some are clearly eligible (2), and others are listed as SALs (1). These
classifications aid in GIS analysis of site distributions, but are not intended to replace the THC review
process for individual ground-disturbing projects requiring review.
The reporting process looks at sites by types, then discusses them as groups (e.g. open campsite;
farmstead), and, rather than go into unnecessary or redundant discussion for each, gives analytical weight
to a site or site type and its relative contribution to the relevant discussion. As a result, some sites are
discussed more than once, emphasizing the pertinent component or category.
This report also serves as the accompanying document for the artifact collections from the property
(Table 9). As with the other records, these artifacts have varying degrees of documentation and
provenience, but help preserve the archaeological record at Muleshoe Bend.

PREHISTORIC COMPONENTS

There are 40 sites with prehistoric components (Figure 93). These are grouped by perceived function (site
type) which consist of lithic scatter, lithic procurement, limited activity or mixed use, and open campsite.
Lithic scatters
Lithic scatters are locations where chipping debris not suggestive of lithic procurement is present, and
also lack other indicators of specific land use such as tools, food remains, or fire-cracked rock. There are
four such sites at Muleshoe Bend (Table 10).
Table 10. Lithic scatters at Muleshoe Bend.

41BT283
41TV498
41TV505
41TV2291
Sites 41BT283, 41TV498, and 41TV505 comprise small numbers of flakes seen within historical site
boundaries. They probably represent observer bias given that historical materials were present, and so
minor amounts of prehistoric chipping debris were also observed. Site 41TV2291 was recorded by shovel
testing an area of loamy sands and sands, where soils are mapped as Travis gravelly soils, which have an
18-cm fine sandy loam A horizon (Werchan et al. 1974). Comparison of the soil profile and shovel test
data suggest a pocket of redeposition of sandy topsoils. Materials encountered in four shovel tests totaled
about 10 very small flakes and flake fragments, found between 20 and 80 cmbs.
As is often the case, there is little that can be said of such sites. Muleshoe Bend is the type of area that
would likely yield a few artifacts at any given location if examined long enough and hard enough. So
while these sites do help place human presence across the landscape, they offer little in the way of
research potential, and these components are not considered eligible for formal SAL status.

Lithic procurement sites
There are 14 identified lithic procurement sites at Muleshoe Bend (Table 11). Lithic procurement sites are
defined as having a predominance of early stage reduction materials such as large hard-hammer flakes,
cores, and tested cobbles. These are typically within gravel deposits, the locations of which can be
predicted geologically.

The original geologic maps of Muleshoe Bend show the majority of the eastern part of the landform as
Quaternary terrace deposits; i.e. Pleistocene gravel deposits (Qt) with bands of older Sycamore sand
(Ksy) at higher elevations that abut Cow Creek limestone and Hammett shale (Kch) (Barnes 1981). A
fairly narrow band of Holocene floodplain is mapped around the edge of the bend, and corresponds with
the full lake elevation. More recent imagery has combined most of the Qt and Ksy, with a much smaller
area of Qt apparently âlaggingâ at a higher elevation (Figure 94). The primary difference is that the Ksy
formation is described as a conglomeration of pebbles, gravels, and boulders of early Cretaceous or even
Permian age. The potential for there to be gravels suitable for aboriginal use would be similar, once
gravels separated from the surrounding cement. Personal observation has noted chert boulders in excess
of 30 cm diameter.

Figure 94. Distribution of geological units at Muleshoe Bend.

Of the 14 sites described as having lithic procurement components, six, 41TV496, 41TV497, 41TV500,
41TV501, 41TV1792, and 41TV1793, are fully or mostly within Sycamore sands. Sites 41TV506,
41TV507, 41TV2287, 41TV2288, and 41TV2289 are shown mostly or wholly either in Holocene
194

alluvium or within the lake itself. This is an inaccurate representation, and these sites should be
considered to be either within Ksy or Qt deposits. Site 41BT347 is within mapped Kch, which may have
scattered cobbles in transitional areas between the limestone and the sandstone components. More likely,
this minor site has seen some colluvial movement of cherts from elsewhere, or mapping resolution is not
sufficiently fine grained.
Site 41TV1793 produced two rather unique items; an apparent incised pebble, and an ornamental sword
hilt made of âpot metal.â The latter is single-sided, as if to be displayed on a wall.

Figure 95. Possible incised pebble, obverse and reverse, 41TV1793.

Figure 96. Decorative sword hilt, 41TV1793.

Sites 41BT148 and 41TV502 are both described as multi-use sites, where lithic procurement occurred but
where there is also evidence of other, more generalized activities, i.e. the mixed use site definition used in
this report and defined more fully elsewhere. Both of these sites are within gravel-bearing deposits, but
also have substantial areas within the Cow Creek limestone/Hammett shale formations. The potential
diversity of resources appears represented by diversity in activities. And although the description of the
soils does not fully support numerous cobbles, the majority of the âpureâ procurement sites are within
Travis gravelly soils.

195

None of the lithic procurement components at Muleshoe Bend are particularly noteworthy. The ancient
gravels tend to have dense cortex, and due to millennia of movement are likely to have internal flaws,
making them less than optimal choices for fine tools. They would, however, probably serve well for dayto-day informal or expedient use, and could be exploited either logistically or as part of an activity
embedded in other rounds. None of these components are considered to be eligible for formal SAL status.

Mixed Use Sites
The âmixed useâ or âlimited activityâ site crept into LCRA terminology following several surveys
conducted by Steve Kotter, then of Prewitt and Associates, who referred to sites that were more complex
than simple lithic scatters but did not fully exhibit characteristics of full-blown campsites. They are
typically in upland settings and contain tools, food remains (usually mussel shell), and perhaps some firecracked rock, but not in quantities to indicate intensive use. They might be lookouts, very short-term
camps, probably used for logistically exploiting a particular resource, or might actually represent highly
mobile foraging groups rather than logistically-based collectors (sensu Binford 1981). Eight such sites
have been identified (Table 12).
Table 12. Mixed use sites at Muleshoe Bend.

41TV502
41TV1777

41BT148
41BT480
41TV503
41TV2255

Two of these sites, 41TV502 and 41BT148, are seen as subareas or palimpsests of tools, flake scatters, or
food remains inconsistent with the lithic procurement also seen occurring. Site 41BT147, when first
recorded in 1979, was described as a scatter of 20â30 mussel shells, one with a perforated umbo, several
tertiary flakes, and scattered fire-cracked rock of uncertain origin. When it was revisited in 1997 much of
the same material was present, but a brush fire had necessitated bulldozing a fire lane through the site,
which is located on the fenceline adjacent to private property.
Sites 41BT480 and 41BT494 are both tool scatters located on lands leased by Ridge Harbor. They are
both relatively near open campsites 41BT343 and 41BT344. Site 41TV480 was located along a deep
drainage and comprised a crude gouge, a large edge-modified flake, and a crude core on limestone
bedrock. No other cultural material was seen. The gouge most closely resembles a unifacial Clear Fork
tool, possibly Early Archaic in age. The site may represent an extraction activity.
Site 41BT494 is located on a high stony terrace overlooking the two campsites. The site consisted of a
small cluster of stone tools consisting of two Archaic-aged dart point fragments, two medial biface
fragments, a small chopper, and an end-and-side scraper. USGS maps indicated small cabins were once in
this area, and it is possible the artifacts are the result of recent collecting. If not, then they also appear to
represent a short-term activity area.
The remaining three sites, 41TV503, 41TV1777, and 41TV2255, are located on lands leased by T-Bar-M
Camp, and are in the vicinity of open camps 41TV250, 41TV504, and 41TV1777. Site 41TV503 was
196

described in 1979 as a thin scatter of cores, interior flakes, scattered burned rock, and a metate fragment,
and fell somewhere between interpretation as a limited activity area and a camp. An attempt to relocate
the site in 1997 was unsuccessful, and it was thought to have deflated, perhaps completely into the lake,
during the intervening period.
Recorded during the T-Bar-M assessment in 1997, 41TV1777 was described as a light scatter of debitage
and scattered fire-cracked rock. Also present were two cores, a battered hammerstone or chopper (perhaps
a crusher?), and a few pieces of mussel shell. The diffuse nature of the artifacts indicated a short-term,
disturbed activity area, and a septic field was subsequently placed over it.
Site 41TV2255 was a very light but very discrete artifact scatter consisting of about 50 interior chips and
flakes, a side-notched dart point, a blade-like edge-modified flake, and a very small antler tine. This last
was not seriously considered to be part of the prehistoric artifact assemblage, but its presence was
intriguing.
Geologically, the sites are fairly evenly split between the Hammett Shale/Cow Creek Limestone and the
Sycamore Sand formations. There is more diversity in soil types than for lithic procurement sites, and
they are found in areas with clay, clay loams, and silty clays as well as limestone rock outcrops. None
were found in the Travis gravelly soils where the majority of the lithic procurement sites were located.
While it is tempting to impose order on these sites, it is difficult to say more than that they represent land
use, but not whether it was for direct support of large riverside camps or the result of small wandering
bands, or some combination. None of the mixed use/limited activity sites retain enough integrity or
diversity of materials to warrant formal listing as State Antiquities Landmarks.
Open Campsites
Open campsites are locations where diversity, and often a density, of materials are present that indicate
repeated or stable use of the site for habitation. There is typically a preponderance of formal and informal
chipped stone tools, ground stone, mussel shell and bone, fire-cracked rock and burned rock features. The
apparent favorable landforms that invite repeated use create an interpretive challenge, and multiple
occupations are often seen across a single surface. There are 14 open campsites at Muleshoe Bend (Table
13).

Of the 14 sites, all but two, 41TV495 and 41TV504, are located along or very near the original (or
present) channel of the Colorado River. These latter two sites are located close to the full pool elevation
of Lake Travis, and both have minimal recorded information.
41TV495
Site 41TV495 was first recorded in 1979 and described as a multipurpose camp, with debitage, mussel
shell, scattered burned rocks, and hearths. Although partially destroyed by shoreline erosion, it was felt to
have some intact deposits and was recommended for testing. A revisit in 1997 was during a period when
the lake elevation was higher than in 1979, and little material was observed. There are no records that the
site was revisited during later periods of lower lake levels, although it is known that informal visits were
made. Although it is likely this site is destroyed, a formal revisit will be required to confirm this. As such,
the site remains of undetermined eligibility.

Site 41TV504 is very similar in setting and recording circumstances. In 1979 it was recorded as a multiple
purpose camp with tertiary flakes, fire-cracked rock, and two possible hearths, partially destroyed by
shoreline erosion with possible intact deposits. It was informally revisited in 1994 and shovel testing was
recommended. As with 41TV495, there is no record of further work. For both sites this is likely due, at
least in part, to the discovery of much larger and more visible campsites, such as 41TV1794, where
attempts at more detailed recording expenditures seemed warranted. Site 41TV504 remains of
undetermined eligibility.
41TV1342
Site 41TV1342 is the most visually intriguing of the remainder of these components (Figure 97).
Unfortunately, it is located at the extreme southern portion of Muleshoe Bend, outside the formal park or
leased areas, and is relatively difficult to access, as it can be reached only across private land or by boat.
The site is located primarily along the west and north sides of Red Bluff Creek, a relatively short, steep
tributary of the Colorado River. It is not clear how close the site is to the original river, however it is
located on an outside bend, and the river appears to be wide and relatively shallow here.
The site was first recorded in 1987 when it apparently was reported to LCRA archaeologists, who
discovered it had been long collected. It was recorded as the âSissy Site,â possibly for Sissy
Hollingsworth, whose family has long lived in the area. Three areas were described along with a large
burned rock midden and several smaller satellite campsites. Area âAâ had Middle Archaic points (Travis,
Nolan through Late Archaic (Montell, Marshall, Ensor) and several bifaces. Area âBâ had only
Pedernales points, while Area âCâ had Late Prehistoric Scallorn and Perdiz points and ceramics, as well
as two beveled knives. The burned rock midden, part of Area âA,â also had five corner-tang bifaces.
Apparently no attempt was made to retrieve the artifacts, some of which (from Area âBâ) would have
come from private property if collected after 1983 when LCRA sold that area.

The site was not revisited formally until 2006 when calls came in that the site was being impacted by an
unknown party. The person or persons took it upon themselves, during a period of low lake levels, to
remove cypress stumps and otherwise lower the burned rock midden portion of the site, presumably to
allow easier and/or safer boat navigation, and possibly to facilitate movement of a boat dock further into
the cove once lake levels rose.
Upon arrival at the site it was seen that, indeed, a bulldozer or front-end loader had essentially destroyed
this portion of the site, although it is possible that there are remnants still intact. Visual inspection of the
area noted dark organic soils, redeposited fire-cracked rock, burned clay, probable bison bone, an area of
about seven exposed heaths, a very thin distal portion of a probable a projectile point (possibly a Montell
point), and the proximal section of a probable knife (biface).
Despite eyewitness accounts of events leading up to the siteâs being impacted, LCRA rangers, who
investigated, were unable to connect anyone with the crime, which remains unsolved.
At this same time the ground between Area âAâ and Area âCâ was resurveyed. Areas with multiple
hearths, fire-cracked rock, and groundstone were documented. As Area âCâ was reached, dense firecracked rock, a lighter scatter of burned rock, and a possible shell midden were seen. At least two large
hearths were mapped, one primarily of limestone and one almost entirely of quartzite (Figure 98). An
arrow point preform and fragmentary dart point were also seen, partially supporting the earlier premise
that there is a strong Late Prehistoric component in this area.

Figure 98. Quartzite hearth at Area C, 41TV1342.

Area âBâ was revisited under similar circumstances in 2011, after reports of scraping across a narrow spit
of land exposed during low lake levels. Large amounts of fire-cracked rock, chert debitage, and mussel
shell were observed, with a seemingly buried zone between 30 and 60 cmbs (Figure 99). GPS and
subsequent map and boundary review determined that the majority of this area was located on private
200

property, although the westernmost section of the âpeninsula,â where disturbance was minimal, was
found to be LCRA property. No diagnostic artifacts were found at that time.
Site 41TV1342âs ultimate research potential remains unknown, although its history of local collecting and
unauthorized land modifications have severely compromised portions of it. Despite this, pockets of high
integrity deposits may still exist, and, if so, the research potential would be high.

41TV250, 41TV1778, 41TV1794, 41TV1910, 41TV1911, 41BT343, 41BT344
The remainder of the riverside campsites are quite similar to each other in general composition. Each is
on the edge of the eroding bank of the Colorado River channel and consist of varying amounts of firecracked rock, chipping debris and tools, mussel shell, and bone. In some cases clusters of Rabdotus
species snail are present, but are also seen in non-cultural context, and are presumed at this time to be the
result of natural processes.
Site 41TV1794 is the most extensive of these sites, although its presence on a sloping terrace edge make
it problematic. Site 41TV1910 may be the best candidate for isolating discrete features, as the terrace
edge is higher and much more abrupt.
In general, each of these riverside campsites extend an unknown distance (or none at all) into the terrace
tread. Labor capital has been spent so far in identifying and minimally recording these sites. At the time
of this writing Lake Travis has returned to full elevation after several years of being well below normal.
When lake levels recede, as they surely will, systematic backhoe trenching âbehindâ these sites would be
201

very beneficial in determining what, if any, research value they retain. Until then they have to be
considered of undetermined eligibility.
41TV1794
Site 41TV1794 is by far the largest of the sites documented at Muleshoe Bend, and is mapped as both
concentrations and discontinuous scatters of fire-cracked rock, mussel shell, debitage, groundstone, and
tools (Figure 100). There is also a minor historic component, which is discussed below. When first
recorded in 1996, GPS points requiring post-processing were obtained. These were subsequently lost.
Various revisits over the years also resulted in GPS point records, but the correlations are often vague.
The majority of the observed material is exposed in the sloping river bank at elevations between 20 and
30 feet above the river channel (Figure 101). There is a lower floodplain zone that is rarely exposed, and
when it is, is rarely dry enough to walk across. These may correspond with J. Charles Kelleyâs 40- and
20-foot terraces as described at the Grelle site (41BT1). Kelley suggested that the 40-foot terrace was
responsible, by way of redeposition, for the 20-foot terrace, and that any cultural stratigraphy in the 20foot terrace would likely be reversed.

Figure 100. Site 41TV1794.

202

The site has produced a Nolan point, a Late Archaic dart point fragment, a Scallorn point, a Perdiz point,
and a piece of bone-tempered ceramic, all from the sloping bank (Figure 102; Figure 103). Other items,
not collected, included an apparently incised mano and a perforated mussel shell. This last item was the
first of several that have been seen along the lake shore, where clearly the higher hinge portion of the
mussel shell was in the process of being eroded by sand and water action, eventually creating the
impression of an intentional artifact. These types of shells need clear contextual information before
intentional modification is suggested.
Two hand auger borings and two shovel tests have been excavated on the terrace edge. The locations of
these are poorly known, especially for the two shovel tests. The auger tests were performed with a 3-inch
(c. 10-cm) diameter core with an extendable T-handle. They were excavated to depths of 185 and 205 cm,
and were spaced about 20 m apart. The soil profile of the second, located a bit further inland on the
terrace, had a much greater amount of clay within the soil descriptions. No cultural material was found in
either.
The two shovel test locations are unknown. They were primarily through what was described as brown
silt loam and had minimal recovery, although both had a single tertiary chip between 80 and 100 cm.

41TV1910
Site 41TV1910 probably has the greatest detail in recording of the riverside camps. It is located on the far
eastern edge of the bend and is bounded to the south by a pronounced gully. The site extends northward
for a distance of about 300 m. At the southern end was the greatest accumulation of cultural material,
centered in an approximate 25-m-diameter area. This yielded quantities of fire-cracked rock, mussel shell,
various tools, manos, and a massive limestone metate fragment, whichmeasured 33-x-40 cm and was 9
cm thick (Figure 104; Figure 105). A Frio point was recovered from this area.
Beginning about 70 m to the north of this area is a series of features, seen primarily cascading out of the
20-ft-tall river bank. An exception was Feature 9, which consisted of three distinct concentrations of firecracked rock, with the appearance of separate heating features. One consisted of nine large rocks with two
apparent manos. About a meter distant was a concentration of eight large rocks, up to 20 cm in diameter.
Approximately equidistant between the two features was a hearth consisting of about 18 rocks up to 15

204

cm in diameter, composed of sandstone, quartzite, and limestone. These three features may actually
comprise a single feature with only portions exposed.

Figure 104. Fire-cracked rock on terrace tread, south end, 41TV1910.

Figure 105. Large metate at 41TV1910.

The remainder of the features contained varying amounts of rock and other material and were exposed on
the terrace edge. Feature 1 was about 110 cm in length (along the shore) and 70 cm wide (across [down])
the shore). It contained about 22 rocks up to 15 cm in diameter, with a few outlying rocks and another 30
or so that had slumped below the feature. No other cultural material was observed.
Feature 2 was somewhat larger, about 100 cm in length and 140 cm wide. It consisted of about 24 rocks,
mostly between 15 and 20 cm in diameter that were clearly eroding out of reddish silt. This seemed to be
an incipient or maybe single-use feature, as the rocks were not heavily fractured, although some were
seen to have cracked in place. An Early Triangular point was collected from very near this feature.

205

Feature 3 comprised two buried fire-cracked rocks, about 8 cm in diameter, lying roughly 23 cm from
each other (Figure 106). They were well-embedded at about 130 cm below the top of the terrace. There
were three other loosely associated rocks. Feature 4 was similar, and was recorded as three rocks eroding
out of the cutbank.
Feature 5 consisted of about 20 rocks averaging around 15 cm in diameter, clearly fire-cracked. Although
the feature suffered from erosion, the main portion was largely intact and about 30 cm in diameter. A
half-dozen thinning flakes and an early stage biface were closely associated.
Feature 6 was composed of three widely spaced burned rocks, two blade-like flakes, and an early stage
biface. Feature 7 was similar, with 11 rocks seen forming a line down the edge of the cutbank. It was at
this point that debitage became more frequent. This is the most southerly of the recorded features.
Further to the north, Feature 8 consisted of three tightly packed quartzite rocks. It was about 20 m south
of Feature 9, the surface manifestation.
Site 41TV1910 is intriguing in that it appears to hold intact buried deposits. What remains unknown is
whether these materials are simply a veneer or remnant deposit or if they represent additional, substantial
buried materials.

206

Figure 106. Feature 3, buried burned rock and cleaned profile at 41TV1910.

The most likely soil across this setting (now mapped as âWaterâ) is Heaton loamy fine sand, which is
described as an Alfisol with a 50-cm-thick brown fine sand over an eluviated horizon to 76 cm below
where a reddish sandy clay loam Bt horizon is encountered. This last seems to correspond with the
presence of much of the archaeological material at 41TV1910 (and elsewhere along the lake). The Early
Triangular point may help to date this deposit, which J. Charles Kelley, when working upstream at 41BT1
(the Grelle site) recognized as resting below âblack humic siltsâ and above âyellowish gritty clayâ (Kelley
1940:2). Kelley noted artifacts in the overlying humic soils, often at the contact, but not within the lower
reddish silts, although he expected he eventually would, and then did (hearth 5 in Area 49, at 4 ft 10 in
[1.5 m] below the surface and later at least one more). This was referred to as archeological level AD, and
was interpreted as a rapidly aggrading surface with sparse cultural materials. No artifacts, other than a
longbone, thought perhaps to be an atlatl, are described from this zone. Notably, Pedernales and Nolan
points were found in the humic soils above the red silts.

41TV1911
Site 41TV1911 is located just downstream from 41TV1910 and separated from it by a deep erosional cut.
While very similar in appearance, it lacks detailed feature descriptions. When first recorded in 2000 it was
described as an area of fire-cracked limestone, mussel shell and debitage, and only described as being
about 10 m in diameter in size. When revisited in 2011 and 2012 it was seen to be substantially larger,
extending about 80 m onto the shore and about 40 m along the shore. In addition to an increase in
observed material, an apparent hearth was also noted. Much of the material was seen near the terrace edge
opposite 41TV1910, and it may once have been a single locale. This siteâs setting and recommendations
are the same as described above for 41TV1910.

41BT343 and 41BT344
These two sites are located at the far upstream portion of the bend, and are on either side of a bifurcated
canyon system that drains into the Colorado River (Figure 107; Figure 108). Dense to very dense cultural
material has been observed eroding out of the steep banks, consisting of the typical fire-cracked rock,
mussel shell, ground stone, tools, and debitage. There is also a (possible) double historic component at
41BT344 consisting of a farmstead and a riverside foundation (both discussed below in the section on
Historic Components).
Three shovel tests were excavated adjacent to artifact concentrations at 41BT344 in 2000. Although the
records have not been located, the site form at the time indicates there was little recovery, and it was
suggested that the site, in general, was surficial and/or deflated. A dart point reportedly was collected
from the surface, but has not been located within the Muleshoe Bend collections. A field sketch of it or
another point suggests a small-bodied Late Archaic type.
207

Figure 107. Sites 41BT343 and 41BT344.

208

Site 41BT343 was cursorily recorded in 2000, then more thoroughly assessed in 2012. Five shovel tests
were excavated, mostly to depths of 40-60 cm, except for that was terminated at 20 cm when a possible
burned rock feature was encountered (Figure 109). Soils were described generally as yellowish brown silt
loams. Recovery was moderate, with fire-cracked rock, debitage, and mussel shell documented. A
resharpened Andice point was observed, as well as two âcrushersâ, which have been found at other
locations along Lake Travis (Prewitt 1982). Given the preponderance of groundstone, including portable
metates, these are surmised to have been used for pecking metate surfaces. Once again, shovel testing is
inconclusive but not promising. Deep testing is the only way to make any definitive assessment of the
sites.

209

41TV250 and 41TV1778
These are both terrace sites that lack the pronounced drop-off seen at most of the other riverside camps.
Site 41TV1778 is similar to 41TV1342 in that it both are removed from the main portion of the property
and are essentially landlocked. The site is documented primarily as a farmstead (discussed below in the
Historic Component section), but also has a prehistoric component that has little documentation. The site
was visited once during a period of lower lake levels, when it was confirmed that it was the location of
the âBill Johnson placeâ, which had previously been misplotted. At the same time, scatters of fire-cracked
rock, debitage, mussel shell, and presumably groundstone were observed. No subsurface testing has been
done and the eligibility of the prehistoric component of the site remains undetermined.
Site 41TV250 was first recorded in 1938 during the Marshall Ford survey. A. T. Jackson noted it as the
âNella T. Evans placeâ and described it as a small campsite which did not have âsufficient imprintance to
justify digging.â The site was revisited in in 1979 prior to brush clearing activities, and described as
apparently highly eroded, with potential only for buried deposits in the upper portion of the site. In 1997
the site was enlarged to include the historic farmstead (discussed below), and was substantially resized
along the shoreline from what was seen in 1979.
The prehistoric component lies across a two-pronged flat between two short tributary drainages. Cultural
material was present in varying degrees across an eroding edge, as noted in 1979, as well as along the
sloping land that was exposed when lake levels dropped. Cultural material was seen across the surface on
the southwest trending lobe, while to the east, where the land form was steeper, two seemingly separate
(but overlapping) concentrations were observed eroding out of the upper portion of the terrace. The main
difference between the two was a greater number of large flakes to the north than the south.
The site has produced Nolan, Fairland, and Darl points, a strangulated uniface, and a perforated mussel
shell. This site, however, is where a mussel shell was seen on the waterâs edge, with wear on the upper
hinge, which once lightly touched, became perforated. Once again, these artifacts need careful attention to
context, and many in collections may actually be ecofacts.
Other Campsites: 41TV1795, 41TV1796, 41TV1797, 41TV2511
The remainder of the sites in this category have little descriptive information or lack distinctive
characteristics. Site 41TV1795 was originally recorded as a small, discrete lithic scatter. Later summary
notes indicate the presence of fire-cracked rock and possibly a hearth. Sites 41TV1796 and 41TV1797
were both recorded in 1997 and have not been systematically revisited. The first was described as a 10-x10-m area with a few flakes, burned rock and a granite mano. The second was much larger, about 75-x100 m, but only flakes, chips, and fire-cracked limestone are mentioned. Site 41TV2511 received a
trinomial based on a site form derived from descriptions for two GPS points marking tertiary debitage, a
core, scattered burned rock, and a possible small burned rock midden.
Summary

210

In general, these sites are all largely unknown, beyond what has been observed on the surface.
Observations and limited testing at sites such as 41TV250, 41TV1794, 41BT343 and 41BT344 have
suggested there is a low potential for substantial, intact deposits within the stream-side terrace. Others,
such as 41TV1910 and 41TV1911, have a seemingly high but completely untapped potential for useful
further research. At present, these sites are inaccessible, and hopefully protected underneath the waters of
Lake Travis. When water levels recede sufficiently, a program of systematic backhoe trenching would be
of great use to better determine what remains of these sites. All of the campsites are considered to be of
undetermined status.

HISTORIC COMPONENTS
There are six homestead sites associated with Turner Farm and three that are apparently individual
enterprises. There are five sites along the edge of the original river channel, some with substantial
amounts of apparent foundation or chimney rock that may predate Turner Farm. There are three sites in
upland or near upland settings that have no clear associations, although two of these may predate Turner
Farm as well.
The Turner Farm sites have been discussed by Utley (1996), who conducted oral history interviews with a
number of former residents of the farm. For example, in a conversation with G. W. Woods in 1994, Utley
learned that there was a fairly high turnover of tenants and recalled Tatums, Heffingtons, Crumleys,
Trammells, Gilleys, and Hobbs families, not all of which are shown on the 1936 map. The houses were
all similar, âsmall, rough lumber structures consisting of a front porch, two central rooms, and an addition
across the back elevationâ (Utley 1996:35). The rear addition usually served as a kitchen and dining area.
Most of the houses had adjacent below-ground cisterns, hand dug and partially stone lined, with above
ground collars. There was at least one well.
Woods recalled a fair amount of traffic across the farm, as there was a nearby river crossing. Area
families would use the crossing to visit friends and relatives, bring goods to the gin or gristmill, and shop
at the nearby grocery store.
Cotton seems to have been the primary crop, and each family was responsible for selling their own
production, with one-fourth of the proceeds going to the landlord. Corn was delivered to a central
repository, which the foreman of the farm oversaw and then sold when he felt the time was appropriate,
allowing him a portion of the proceeds, although whether from the ownerâs one-third or tenantsâ twothirds is not clear. Pecans were another valuable cash crop, although one-half of the harvest from Turner
Farm went to the owner. Area farmers also had supplementary vegetable crops and stock, primarily hogs,
chickens, turkeys, and milk cows. Harvest and processing periods were communal events, with the
neighbors all gathering to can corn, butcher and smoke hogs (each farm had a smokehouse) and otherwise
assist with the labors of agricultural life. There are seven sites associated with the tenant farming
community (Table 14).

Other
41BT283 â J. Hays â cistern
41BT344 - C. Hollingsworth - cistern
There is little left at most of these sites, which typically consist of a few foundation stones, household
debris, and often a trash disposal area on a nearby slope. The cisterns were removed from all but
41TV1779 in 2008 (Hixson 2009). This site is perhaps the best preserved of all the homesteads, with a
substantial chimney fall, the well-built cistern which still holds water, and the outlines of lower fields
likely forming garden space, and a likely garage or workshop area.

Figure 111. Cistern at 41TV1779. Note chimney fall behind, to left.

Although Turner Farm was originally considered as potentially eligible for nomination as a historic
district, based particularly on its role in the near-western extent of cotton production in Texas (Utley
1996:84), it was also noted that each of the sites had integrity issues, and that individually they did not
merit formal listings. Sites 41TV498, 41TV507, 41TV508 and most of 41TV499 were determined
ineligible, as were the cisterns at 41BT283, 41TV250 and 41TV1779. By extension, these last three sites
are also considered individually ineligible. There is however, high potential for interpretive purposes, and
it is recommended that LCRA voluntarily continue to manage these sites though avoidance.
Site 41TV1778 and 41BT344 are outliers in the sense that they are removed from the park, and are
instead located on contiguous lands. Site 41TV1778, known as the Bill Johnson place (Utley 1996) but
depicted as the Joe Tatum place on the 1936 map (Figure 112), is located at the southern end of the farm
and was the foremanâs residence. This is where the corn was stored after harvest, and also the location of
a gin and blacksmith shop, and for a short time (1901-1905) was known as Clover. When the gin
machinery was moved so was the place name, but the buildings remained and were used as barns and
213

other storage (Utley 1996; Thompson and Frasier 1996). The site is located on a land-locked low terrace
bench, and is below the normal pool of Lake Travis. It is therefore poorly recorded. There are numerous
foundation stones, large pieces of metal, and possibly a cistern. This site deserves more documentation
and until it can be further assessed should be considered to have an undetermined eligibility status.
Site 41BT344 is depicted as the Hollingsworth place. It is located at the far upstream end of the bend and
is on land leased by a private enterprise. A filled-in cistern is present, but the house location has been
covered by a parking lot and boat ramp. There minimal artifacts. This site is considered to be ineligible.

Unknown Historic Components
There are five sites located along the river edge that have historic components and cannot be directly
associated with known farmstead sites, except, perhaps, at 41BT344, as described above (Table 15). In
general, these sites are relatively minor scatters of historic-aged artifacts in association with limestone
rubble. None of these are depicted on available maps, and the artifact assemblages often seem to predate
Turner Farm occupation. These may be field houses, early settlements prior to institutionalized
knowledge of river flooding, or some other manifestations, including a molasses mill that is very roughly
shown on a sketched map of the area (Fraser 1996:ix).
Table 15. Riverside historic component sites.

41BT344
41TV1794
41TV1912
41TV1913
41TV2510
At 41BT344, the Hollingsworth place, there is a square limestone foundation measuring about 15 feet on
a side. A burned wooden post, possibly a pier, is located nearby. It is situated about 100 m northnorthwest of the house area. About halfway between the house area and this feature is a discrete scatter of
cut nails, solarized glass, a crockery fragment and various bits of rusted metal, near a short cedar post
alignment.
At 41TV1794 there is a discrete scatter consisting of a whiteware, cut square nails, wire nails, a motherof-pearl button, a metal button, a rimfire (.44 Henry) cartridge casing, horseshoes, a frying pan handle and
a few limestone blocks.
At 41TV1912 there is an apparent collapsed limestone foundation that is about 15 feet in length, parallel
with the river. It may have once been supported by piers, or more likely on a now-eroded river bank
surface. Artifacts consisted of a fragment of a bottle panel, white stoneware, solarized glass, blue glass,
and possibly associated bricks.
Site 41TV1913 is very similar to 41TV1912. The apparent limestone foundation is about 12 feet in
length, again parallel with the river. There was a minimal artifact assemblage consisting of a cast iron
skillet handle, a couple of whiteware sherds, some cut nails and bits of rusted metal.
214

Site 41TV2510 had two distinct limestone features. Feature 1 was a large rock scatter from the terrace top
down the slope toward the river. It was about 30 feet in length parallel with the river. Feature 2 was much
smaller, containing about 30 rocks some 6 feet in diameter. It was located 35 feet north (upstream) of
Feature 1, and was at midslope on the terrace edge. It had no associated artifacts. Artifacts in the vicinity
(within or just south) of Feature 1 included several whiteware sherds, a number of pieces of old aqua and
amber glass, cut nails, pieces of a harmonica and an iron skillet.
These sites are all extremely deflated with minimal artifact assemblages. Despite this, these sites
potentially add time depth to the Muleshoe Bend story. Interestingly, the Handbook of Texas states that
the highest concentration of slaves in Burnet County was at nearby Spicewood and Double Horn Creek
(Smyrl 2016). There were relatively few slaves in Burnet County (235 owned by 65 persons in 1860) due
in part to its relatively recent settlement plus the fact that there was little arable land (Debo 1979:98). The
wide Muleshoe Bend floodplain would have been an exception, so it is possible that at least some of these
sites are associated with slaves or recent freedmen. These sites should all be considered to be of
undetermined SAL status.

Other Historic Components
There are three sites with historic components located in upland settings and not associated with Turner
Farm or other known homesteads. One of these, 41TV496, appears to be a twentieth century trash dump
containing metal banding, apparent tractor parts, a Mason jar, crockery and clear glass and is not
considered to be eligible. The other two sites, 41TV501 and 41TV505 are more intriguing.
Table 16. Additional historic components.

41TV496
41TV501
41TV505

41TV501
Site 41TV501 is located on a south-trending ridge overlooking a fairly substantial inlet to the south. The
original recording in 1979 found, in addition to the prehistoric material discussed elsewhere in this report,
a light scatter of glass, metal whiteware and stoneware. In 1996, when LCRA archaeologists revisited the
site, three apparent historic features were recognized, which consisted of varying amounts of tabular rock
(possibly the âburned rockâ observed in 1979) along with metal, ceramics and glass. The largest of these,
Feature 3, was approximately 10 m in diameter and contained perhaps 40 pieces of rock scattered around
a low mounded area. Artifacts within and surrounding the feature included a green salt-glazed ceramic, an
aqua panel bottle fragment, purple and clear glass, a snuff bottle fragment, and, importantly, two cut nails.

Feature 2 was a shallow depression in the ground, about 10 feet in length, with a few pieces of tabular
limestone surrounding it. Nearby Feature 1 was a scatter of tabular limestone and sandstone with five
pieces of a cast iron pot or kettle. Two of the pieces had protruding perforated âlugs,â possibly
representing a lid with a bail handle. A pronounced lip was visible on another piece. Marks included âS
No1, and a symbol similar to the upper portion of a Celtic cross, with the letter A in the center and E, R
and Y in each of the three âtabs.â
The purpose of the site remains unknown. It may represent a processing area such as rendering or soap
production removed from a house location. It may be a hunting camp, or it may be a relatively ephemeral
house site. It does appear to predate the Turner Farm occupation, and so may have some connection with
the riverside historic sites. Additional work through systematic shovel testing is recommended.

41TV505
Site 41TV505, largely destroyed, also does not have clear associations with Turner Farm. It was first
recorded in 1979 as a possible chimney fall consisting as a âroughly rectangular pile of limestone rubbleâ
along with historical ceramics and glass, thought to likely postdate the possible house. Even at that time
the siteâs location was popular for camping, and associated disturbances were noted. When revisited in
1997, all that was observed was about five large pieces of limestone forming a right angle within which
was a low, mounded area. There were no clearly associated artifacts, and nearby camping rings seemed to
have incorporated some of the rocks previously reported. Distinctively, however, was a short section of
barbed wire that was collected, and later identified as Scutts (or Scutt) arrow plate, which consisted of a
sheet metal arrow-shaped barb split at the distal end which allowed the plate to be twisted in opposite
directions within two strand wire. It was patented in 1878, according to various sources, although its
period of popularity has not been discovered at this time.
This site, like 41TV501, may represent an activity area or a homesite. The barbed wire sample may
predate Turner Farm, and the site is not depicted on period maps. It is unlikely, but possible, that
systematic shovel testing might reveal more information about the site.
Of these last three historic components, only 41TV501 has reasonable potential to add new information
regarding historic period land use at Muleshoe Bend. The SAL status of the site remains undetermined.
Site 41TV505 is intriguing, but its location on a knoll overlooking the full pool of Lake Travis has
resulted in severe disturbance. It is considered ineligible for formal SAL status, despite the remote
possibility that early (pre-1900) artifacts may be present. Site 41TV496, as an isolated twentieth century
trash dump, is considered ineligible.

SUMMARY DISCUSSION
Muleshoe Bend is one of several LCRA-owned parcels of land along the Lake Travis portion of the
Colorado River. Other substantial holdings are found upstream at Lake Buchanan, within the Llano Uplift
region. These areas form a resource pool that can examine diversity in lifeways in the prehistoric past
through the advent of rural electrification. As an example, approximately 13 km of river distance centered
on Muleshoe Bend contain 177 documented archaeological sites over almost 4,000 acres (Figure 113).
Landscape assessments could include aspect, line-of-site between different site types and locations, leastcost or catchment analyses, among many. Unpublished LCRA work includes a comparison of site types
and observed artifact diversity between Muleshoe Bend and nearby Turkey Bend in order to place sites
within Binfordâs (1980) collector/forager spectrum.
Historic settlement can likewise be explored up and down the river. LCRA work has produced various
oral histories and archival documentation examining the modification and intensification of an agrarian
economy over time. The sociological microcosm that was Turner Farm presents a view of cotton
economy on its western fringes of central Texas. Creation of the lakes then changed the social fabric,
eliminating, or at least greatly inhibiting, decades of interactions between the two sides of the river. To
this day, the north side of the river remains largely rural and isolated, while the south side is experiencing
sustained and recently, explosive growth.
While the total artifact sample across all properties is perhaps not statistically significant, future
researchers may find value in a comparison of the curated items. Lake Buchanan artifacts may be
technologically or stylistically different from those found downstream. The density of well-worn manos
on Lake Buchanan can be startling, and bedrock metates have been recorded. Downstream, isolated crude
choppers have been found, often in upland settings. After seeing several, they became referred to as
âbitted choppers,â given that there was an isolated, gouge-like bit on the distal end. While none are in the
Muleshoe Bend collection, they have been noted elsewhere, notably Turkey Bend, and seem to represent
a specialized extraction technology.
Although this is not a regulatory report in the sense of being project driven, it does lay out
recommendations for individual sites, and upon completion of the review of the recommendations by
THC it is expected that a number of the sites described here will fall into the âineligibleâ category. Such
categorizations, however, serve to shape how potential future projects may take form, and whenever
possible the intrinsic value of a site and its relationship to the property will be given appropriate weight.

Authorityâs Transmission Services Corporation Proposed Substation 2-6 (the Lewis Tract)
Project, Williamson County, Texas

By Andrew F. Malof and Steven R. Evans

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
LCRA is currently in the process of purchasing a parcel of land in Williamson County, within one of two
circles that must contain an electrical substation for a proposed new transmission line to be constructed
between existing substations in Leander and Round Rock. The land is being purchased, but no
construction is imminent.
The substation would be between about 6.7 acres in size. It is known as substation site 2-6, is located on
property presently owned by the Lewis family. It is along RR 2243, also known as Leander Road, a bit
east of Ronald Reagan Blvd.
LCRA Cultural Resources staff has completed a cultural resources assessment of the 2-6 prospective
substation location and associated property in Williamson County (Figure 114). The property for 2-6,
owned by the Lewisâs, is currently in use as a construction storage yard and office, and is approximately
28.9 acres in size, though the proposed substation would only take up 6.7 acres of the property. If
selected, the 2-6 site would be the location for a new substation on the proposed LCRA Leander to Round
Rock Electrical Transmission Line.
LCRA Cultural Resources staff physically surveyed 20.9 acres of the Lewis tract on March 1, 2016, and
completed 14 shovel tests in the area of the potential future substation as presently proposed. Shovel
testing was not attempted in the north part of the property, both because the prospective project has no
anticipated impact at this time (although a substation may eventually be constructed there), and because
most of the area has been covered in 1 to 2 feet of fill material. Additionally, a further 7.97 acres, where
the present office buildings are located, will not be affected by the proposed project, and are also
considered to be in a low probability area (Figure 115). One new archaeological site, 41WM1333, was
discovered as a result of the survey.
Site 41WM1333 is a very minor lithic scatter located on the edge and slope of an upland terrace. It is
considered to be fully recorded and ineligible for formal designation a State Antiquities Landmark. It is
recommended the project be allowed to proceed.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The project area resides in the Edwards Plateau, and is mapped in Oak-Mesquite-Juniper Parks/Woods
(McMahan et al. 1984). This vegetation area consists of Post oak, Ashe juniper, shin, Texas, blackjack,
and live oak, cedar elm, agarito, sumac, and hackberry trees, with Texas prickly pear, curly mesquite, and
Texas wintergrass making up most of the groundcover. Drainages and creeks in the area drain to the
Brazos River system.
The Lewis property sits on Eckrant cobbly clay to the south and Eckrant extremely stony clay to the north
(Werchan and Coker 1983). The Eckrant series soils are described as containing two A horizons of very
dark grey to black clay down to 30 cm, followed by coarsely fractured limestone bedrock. Shovel testing
in the project showed that, for this location, the soil closely follows the profile of 10-25 cm of 7.5YR
230

2.5/1 black clay over 5YR 3/3 dark reddish brown clay. Most shovel tests were terminated at or before 40
cm, and while limestone bedrock was not encountered in any but one shovel test, exposures of the
bedrock can be seen at some places in the project area. All soils encountered were stony or cobbly, and
many were extremely so. An upturned tree observed on the Eckrant extremely stony clay provided
information on the profile at depths below those achieved shovel testing.
Geologically, the property is split between Early Cretaceous Comanchean limestone, shale, and mudstone
in the southern half of the project area, and Early Cretaceous limestone with dolomite and chert in the
northern half of the project area and the rest of the property (Stoeser et al. 2005, Barnes et al. 1992).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The project area is squarely within the Central Texas archaeological region as described by various
authors. This background will be presented in the final version of this report (the annual report for TAC
Permit 7531) and will not be repeated here.
Williamson County has a long, diverse history. The earliest known historic occupants of Williamson
County, the Tonkawas, were a flint-working, hunting people who followed the bison on foot. During the
eighteenth century they made the transition to a horse culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Later
decimated by diseases and warfare with Cherokees and Comanches, the Tonkawas were removed from
Central Texas by the 1850s. Lipan Apaches and Comanches were also associated with the area that would
become Williamson County. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Apaches ranged through the
western part of present Williamson County, raiding Spanish missions established on the San Gabriel
River in the eighteenth century. The Comanches arrived in the area in the eighteenth century and lived in
parts of Williamson County until 1838. After they were pushed out by white settlements, the Comanches
continued to raid settlements in the county until the 1860s (Odintz, 2005).
The area was first explored by the Spanish in the late seventeenth century, when Captain Alonso De Leon
sought an alternate route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas. Anglo settlement
began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic of Texas. In 1835, in an attempt to
strengthen the frontier against Indian attacks, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy
Creek. The post was abandoned in 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the Mexican
invasion. However, two years later in 1838 the first civilian settlement was established by a party of
settlers who built a fort on Brushy Creek.
Several sites along Brushy Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept white settlements from
expanding and a number of the early pioneers were killed by Indians over the next few years. In 1842
many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised settlers to pull back from
the frontier due to the Indian attacks in the area. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx
of settlers who returned to the area came to the frontier along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. In
1848 Williamson County was established with the city of Georgetown as county seat. Pioneers were
attracted by the abundance of timber and good, clear water, and the inexpensive and extremely fertile
land. The first wave of settlers moved from other southern states, particularly Tennessee, and a substantial
231

contingent came from Illinois. This latter group remained pro-Union and Republican in its political
orientation during the secession crisis (Odintz, 2005).
In the years before the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage and was a
populous, agriculturally diverse county. Agricultural pursuits were varied and reflected the countyâs
diversity. Farmers were using the rich blackland soils to grow wheat and corn. Cotton was introduced in
the 1850s but was not an important cash crop for most farmers. The early settlers had found large herds of
wild cattle in the 1840s, and cattle ranching was widespread throughout the county by 1860 (Odintz,
2005).
Political divisions marked Williamson County during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist
sentiment was strong and resolution denouncing secession was adopted by a Texas Constitutional Union
party meeting in 1860. When the war began the majority of the citizens of Williamson County supported
the Confederate cause. While those who remained loyal to the Union fled to Mexico or the North, while
others enlisted in the Union army. Throughout the years of the war Unionists were persecuted and
arrested or hanged. The pattern of violence within the community continued into the summer following
the end to the Civil War. However, the county seems to have been spared much of the political and racial
strife that plagued other Texas towns during Reconstruction. On the other hand, there was a great deal of
crime, much of it violent, in the later nineteenth century. Horse and cattle thieves and some famous
outlaws preyed on citizens, along with family feuds and drunken drawls adding to the toll (Odintz, 2005).
The Civil War caused very little damage in the area, however the county was much poorer in 1870 than it
had been in 1860. Economic recovery was added by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a
dramatic expansion of cotton farming. The establishment of Southwestern University in 1873 and
construction of a railroad in 1878 contributed to the townâs growth and importance. Industry prior to the
1900s included limestone quarries; grist, flour, planning, and woodworking mills; cotton gins; brick, flue,
chair, and mattress factories; tin, pewter, blacksmith, saddlery, and shoe shops; a knitting mill, bakeries,
and confectioneries; the Texas Chautauqua Assembly, a bottling works, and an old mill (Scarbrough,
2005). Agricultural diversification during the middle twentieth century (decrease in cotton production and
an increase in corn, sorghum, wheat, livestock, and poultry farming) was followed by significant social
and economic changes, allowing Williamson County to grow and prosper in the twentieth century.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODS
After reviewing the topography of the property and the anticipated project area, it was determined that
pedestrian survey coupled with shovel testing of areas with appropriate soil depth and conditions was the
best course of action. At the Lewis tract, the area south of the construction yard was surveyed by transects
with 15 meter intervals, and the construction yard was surveyed along its edges where lack of fill revealed
the original ground surface, and numerous recent disturbances provided excellent visibility. Shovel test
locations were initially selected based on the visual topography and soil conditions on the ground, and
later were placed near two areas where surface artifacts had been located, and along terrace edges where
further artifacts would be anticipated. In total, 14 shovel tests were completed within the project area.

232

Shovel tests achieved a mean depth of 22 cm, and all were negative for cultural material. Most were
excavated until a dark reddish brown clay layer was reached, usually below a layer of black clay.

RESULTS
One site was located during the survey of the Lewis tract. Site 41WM1333 is a lithic scatter occurring on
a high terrace to a major tributary to Brushy Creek, and adjacent to a former drainage, with another small
drainage just 130 m to the west (Figure 116). The site consists of just 7 artifacts; 1 thin biface fragment, 1
larges secondary flake, 1 biface thinning flake, 1 patinated tertiary flake, and 3 small tertiary flake
fragments (Figure 117). Shovel testing failed to locate any subsurface cultural material. All but one of the
artifacts was located in a cluster on the terrace edge, with the secondary flake being located on the terrace
slope.
While some chert is available on the property, none of the artifacts appeared to be of that same material.
No temporally diagnostic material was observed, and though the low quantity of artifacts would suggest a
single component, a lack of stratified deposits makes a determination about the number of components
impossible. The material observed was scattered in amongst gravels, some of which may have been
foreign gravels related to later-twentieth century road and building construction. The adjacent road and
former building areas may have concealed or destroyed additional areas of the site.
Given the low quantity of artifacts and condition of the site, LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends
that 41WM1333 be considered ineligible for formal SAL status. No further work is recommended on the
site, and no restrictions should be imposed on future projects impacting 41WM1333.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

LCRA Cultural Resource staff completed an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed 2-6
substation project area and the associated property. One archaeological site, 41WM1333, was located
within the proposed substation project area. Site 41WM1333 is a minor lithic scatter that is recommended
as ineligible for SAL status, and it is recommended that, should 2-6 be selected as the site for the new
substation, the construction be allowed to proceed without restrictions in regards to 41WM1333.
Emergency discovery protocols would of course be in place during construction, and should any new
cultural material be discovered, work in the immediate area of the discovery would halt, and the THC
would be contacted to determine what, if any, avoidance or mitigation efforts would be necessary.

Project on the North Shore of Lake Fayette, Fayette County, Texas

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to clear brush in fall 2016 on approximately
90 acres of land on the north shore of Lake Fayette (Figure 118), which are co-owned by LCRA and City
of Austin Utilities (COA). These lands lie between LCRAâs Oak Thicket and Park Prairie Parks, which
are connected by a 3 mile long hike and bike trail. Lake Fayette is the cooling reservoir for the Fayette
Power Plant, located on the southwest shore, which was built in the 1970s. As part of that project, LCRA
and COA bought, and now co-own, all the land parcels immediately bordering Lake Fayette.
In 1979, LCRA constructed the 87-acre Oak Thicket Park on the north shore and the nearby 12-acre Park
Prairie Park on the northwest shore near Park, Texas. In 1995, these two parks were connected by a 3mile-long greenbelt corridor and hiking trail running along the shoreline. LCRA cultural resources staff
conducted surface surveys and shovel testing for this project, including a 50-acre tract east of Oak Thicket
Park, and found no cultural material (Nightengale 1995).
In 2015, LCRA Cultural Resources staff conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for a brush
clearing project encompassing 123 acres in and around Oak Thicket Park. The 2016 survey brush clearing
is located immediately to the west of the 2015 brush clearing project. Both of these projects are part of a
comprehensive land management plan by the LCRA to increase the natural diversity of LCRA-owned
lands.
The current vegetative state in the 2016 project area is dense oak-elm woodland and oak-mesquite
woodland, with dense vines of green briar and mustang grape. The target vegetative state is tallgrass
prairie and tallgrass-oak savannah (Figure 119). Brush clearing methods may include: bulldozing brush
before stacking it to burn; mulching with a skid-steer-mounted Seppi mulcher and leaving mulch in place;
and hand-clearing and transporting brush to a safe place for burning.
LCRA cultural resources staff, under Texas Antiquities Committee Annual Permit No. 7531, conducted a
file search and fieldwork including targeted surveys of two areas known to have had historical structures
as well as surface survey of several upland ephemeral streams in the project area. LCRA Cultural
Resources staff surveyed a total of 14.3 acres after determining the other 75.7 acres to be of low
probability for cultural resources.
As a result of the 2016 field work, two new sites were recorded. Site 41FY588 is an early- to midtwentieth century farmstead, but is almost completely inundated by Lake Fayette, leaving only a few
fence posts standing at the shoreline. Site 41FY587 is also an early- to mid-twentieth century farmstead,
where numerous concrete features, as well as fences, livestock pens, and surficial material were observed.
Three shovel tests placed at areas of perceived high use were negative for subsurface material. Survey and
shovel testing adhered to THC minimum survey standards, as described below under the heading
Methodology.

241

Both recorded sites were deemed to be of low research value. Site 41FY587 is recommended ineligible
for formal designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), while site 41FY588 is recommended to
remain of undetermined eligibility. No prehistoric material was encountered. Due to the negligible
research value of the material recovered, LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends approving the
entirety of the project area for mechanical brush clearing. While not required, LCRA Cultural Resources
will recommend, however, avoidance or other methods to avoid negative impacts on the sites within the
project area, in accordance with resource management goals on LCRA-owned and managed lands.
During an intensive cultural resources survey, such as this one, conducted under the aegis of LCRAâs
annual permit obtained from the THC, LCRA Cultural Resources maintains a no collection policy.
Project records will be submitted to an accredited curation facility.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Much of the following Environmental Background is taken from the LCRAâs 2015 brush clearing project
at Oak Thicket Park (Larsen et al. 2015).
Located roughly halfway between Austin and Houston, and just northeast of La Grange, Lake Fayette was
formed in 1978 by damming Cedar Creek and encompasses the creek and several tributaries; the normal
pool level being stable at 391 feet msl. The shoreline has many peninsulas, which are the interfluvial
ridges of Cedar Creek and its tributaries. Additionally, the north shore is an upland interfluvial ridge
separating the Cedar Creek drainage in the south from the Clear Creek drainage in the north (Figure 118).

Figure 119: Previously cleared area in Oak Thicket Park, east of the 2016 project area.

Lake Fayette lies in the interior Gulf coastal plains physiographic region of Texas, as defined by the
Bureau of Economic Geology (1996). This region consists of calcareous marine sediments of the Miocene
242

age Goliad, Fleming and Oakville Formations as well as the Pliocene age Willis Formation (United States
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service [USDA, NRCS] 2016). The soils
within the project area are mostly Hallettsville fine sandy loam, Straber loamy fine sand and Frelsburg
clay (USDA, NRCS 2016). These soils are on non-aggrading upland landforms and have a shallow
horizon of loam or sand before turning into dense mottled clay 20-35 cm below the surface. As such, they
are unlikely to hold buried, stratified prehistoric deposits. Historic deposits lie, typically, on or just under
the surface.
The historical climax plant communities (Stellbauer 2004, 2005) in these interfluvial uplands are tallgrass
prairie or tallgrass-oak savannah. Historical agricultural use, abandonment, and fire protection have left
the areas within the project area in an overgrown state of woodlands and shrublands with woody canopy
cover ranging from 40-80% with dense undergrowth. Common plant species include post oak, cedar elm,
netleaf hackberry, eastern red cedar, yaupon, greenbriar, prickly pear, silver bluestem, and woody vines,
such as rattan or grape. According to the ecological site description (Stellbauer 2004, 2005) these areas
provide habitat for deer, turkey, coyote, and many others, as well as bison, wolf, bobcat, mountain lion,
and black bear, historically.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Much of the following prehistoric and historic background information is taken from the LCRAâs 2015
brush clearing project at Oak Thicket Park (Larsen et al 2015).
Prehistoric Background
The project area is located in a portion of Texas occupied by nomadic, hunter-gatherer peoples throughout
all of the prehistoric era. The project area lies outside any of the traditional archeological regions defined
for the state. This is probably due to the fact relatively few surveys had taken place in Fayette County
when archeological regions for the state were first proposed in the 1950s. Presently, the Fayette County
area is marked as southeast of Prewittâs (1981) Central Texas Archaeological Region, north of Hesterâs
(1995) South Texas Archaeological Region, and slightly west of Pattersonâs (1995) Southeast Texas
Archaeological Region.
More recent data from large cultural resource management projects conducted in Fayette County show the
general area is located on the periphery of many projectile point style distributions, a cultural trait
traditionally used to define prehistoric cultural areas in Texas. However, beginning about 3,000 years ago,
many artifact types of the Central Texas region become common, and for that reason the culture
chronology of this region is utilized for this report. Therefore, a sequence of chronological periods that
borrows from work in Central Texas by Johnson and Goode (1994) and Prewitt (1981) is utilized for this
survey report. From earliest to latest in time, these chronological periods are as follows: Paleoindian (pre
6500 B.C.), Early Archaic (6500 to 3500 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3500 to 2200 B.C.), Late Archaic I
(2200 to 50 B.C.), Late Archaic II (50 B.C. to A.D. 700), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 700 to A.D. 1700), which
is divided into the Austin phase (A.D. 700 to 1250) and the Toyah phase (A.D. 1250 to 1700), and,
finally, Historic Indian (A.D. 1700 to 1875).
243

In their 1975 report detailing the results of the Fayette Power Project survey, Jackson and Skelton divided
prehistoric sites into two categories: upland sites and alluvial terrace sites. Upland sites were near
significant streams, usually near confluences, but elevated enough to avoid floodwaters (Jackson and
Skelton 1975:17). These sites were shallow and eroded and lacked time-diagnostic artifacts (likely due to
modern collectors) but seemed generally to be open campsites with large amounts of debitage. No upland
sites on Cedar Creek were recorded on the ephemeral drainages near the 2016 project area, but rather at
the more significant tributaries farther downstream near the dam.
Alluvial terrace sites were generally identified in cutbanks of streams and exhibited stratification due to
their location on aggrading landforms. These sites may have been attractive as sources of chert nodules
and river cobbles used in tool production and food processing. In these sites, Jackson and Skelton found
âextremely large quantities of thermally fractured and percussion-chipped detritusâ (1975: 18), though
time-diagnostics were only found with the chipped stone and not the burned rock, which they thought
may indicate some separation of activities and tool assemblages. During the Fayette Power Project
survey, time-diagnostic artifacts recovered ranged from the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric Austin
phase.

Historic Background
According to the Handbook of Texas Online (Garrett 2010a) the following history of this part of Fayette
County extends back to the Spanish Colonial era. A Spanish trading route running from the Rio Grande to
southwestern Louisiana called La BahÃ­a ran through the area, crossing the Colorado River at La Grange.
The earliest known Anglo settlers were Aylett C. Buckner and Peter Powell, who settled in the area on the
Colorado River in 1819. The area was further settled by members of Stephen F. Austinâs first colony
beginning in 1822. Another notable settler in the area was Joseph Biegel, a German immigrant from
Alsace-Lorraine who bought a league of land in 1832, which lies just southwest of the 2016 project area.
During the Texas Revolution, settlers of Fayette County played a prominent role and the ferry across the
Colorado River, near modern La Grange and known as Burnamâs Crossing, was burned during the
Runaway Scrape.
Nassau Farm (Garrett 2010b) was established in 1843 in nearby Round Top by the Verein zum Schutze
deutscher Einwandrer in Texas, also known as the Adelsverein, a group of German noblemen who
promoted German immigration to Texas. The farm was a working plantation, including some 19 slaves,
and was originally meant as a base for arriving immigrants but was instead used as âa pleasure retreat for
the officers and as a hideaway from their creditorsâ (Garrett 2010b). The presence of the Adelsverein and
settlement by Germans on the Joseph Biegel league established a strong nascent German presence in the
area.
Prior to the Civil War, the economy of Fayette County was heavily dependent on plantations and slave
labor but, due to the changing agricultural economy during Reconstruction, the large plantations were
divided and sold, mainly to immigrant farmers, most of whom were Germans and Czechs (Garrett 2010a).
The German and Czech community on Joseph Biegelâs League and the surrounding area was known as
244

Biegelâs Settlement. Most of this community was inundated by the construction of Lake Fayette in the
late 1970s.
Immigration increased through the nineteenth century and by 1890 nearly one in four residents of Fayette
County was foreign born (Garrett 2010a). Throughout the twentieth century agriculture remained the
primary driver of the economy, though the emphasis shifted from cotton to cattle after the Great
Depression. Oil and gas leases also developed as a common source of income in the twentieth century.
The 2016 project area sits on a league of land (4428.4 acres) granted to J. M. Hensley in 1832, which lies
immediately north of the Biegel League. The Handbook of Texas Online (TSHA 2010) indicates Hensley
was one of Stephen F. Austinâs âOld Three Hundredâ settlers, and a member of Austinâs colony as early
as 1824. Records indicate Hensley, unlike Biegel, never resided on the tract bearing his name. At least as
early as 1834, the Hensley tract was divided into quarters, each of which was 1750 x 3571 varas and
encompassed an area of 1107.1 acres. From 1834 to the present, land in the Hensley league has been
repeatedly subdivided and sold.
The lands in the 2016 project area were previously owned by the Urban and Hilsher families and were
purchased by the LCRA and COA for the construction of Lake Fayette in the 1970s. Lake Fayette was
constructed as a cooling reservoir for the Fayette power plant, which resides on the lakeâs southern shore.
The LCRA/COA lands include the power plant, the cooling reservoir and the majority of the acreage on
the shore of Lake Fayette. When construction was completed, the Urban tract was almost entirely
inundated and the Hilsher Tract was substantially inundated, leaving only the southern and northern ends
above the water.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
As this 2016 brush clearing project is in the immediate vicinity of a 2015 LCRA brush clearing project,
both of which projects are part of LCRAâs land management plan, much of the following is taken from
the 2015 project report (Larsen et al. 2015).
Until the advent of the CRM era beginning in the early 1970s, there were relatively few archaeological
investigations in the area surrounding what is now Lake Fayette. Since the 1970s, archaeological
investigation has usually been tied to construction projects like the Fayette Power Project and the aborted
Cummins Creek lignite mine project, which has led to a marked increase in the number of archaeological
sites. The following discussion of previous archaeological investigations in the area is largely summarized
from Nightengaleâs (1995) report concerning the construction of a greenbelt corridor between Oak
Thicket and Park Prairie parks.
The earliest archaeological investigations in the area were conducted by A.M. Wilson, who surveyed
portions of the Colorado River running though Travis, Fayette, and Bastrop counties in 1930.
Unfortunately, the documentation of Wilsonâs efforts is either lost or insufficient to allow a good
interpretation of his findings. In 1963, John P. Nunley conducted a reconnaissance survey of the proposed
Columbus Bend Reservoir and Colorado River from La Grange to about 20 km upstream of Columbus,
245

resulting in the documentation of 73 new sites. In 1968, Hester and Collins conducted a salvage
excavation of the Frisch Auf! site (41FY42). The site contained six burials, two of which included
identically produced Scallorn points, indicating that they dated to the Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric
period. In 1972, Meir and Hester investigated the Meier Site (41FY59), which had surface deposits of
Paleoindian artifacts.
Throughout the 1970âs, extensive investigations were undertaken to facilitate the construction of the
Fayette Power Plant and cooling reservoir by the Lower Colorado River Authority. Jackson and Skelton
(1975) surveyed 2,400 acres, and documented 19 prehistoric and 10 historic sites. The historic sites
primarily consisted of structures associated with the Biegel settlement. Site 41FY86 is a historic
homestead near the current project area, but not on of LCRA property. It consisted of a log cabin with
hand-adzed floor beams on cedar piers. No artifacts were found in association with the structure. Of the
prehistoric sites, site 41FY74 stands out as a single occupation butcher site of an individual bison dated to
the Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric. Most other prehistoric sites were shallow lithic scatters
interpreted as temporary upland work camps, and occupied at various times over the last 8,000 years.
In 1991 and 1992, LCRA staff archaeologists, with the help of Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) historian Dan Utley and TARL archaeologist David Robinson, completed surveys of several
project areas in the vicinity of Baylor Creek and Lake Fayette in order to facilitate the removal of several
trash dumps, clear a 30 acre area of brush, and remove two structures. The surveys for the trash dumps
and the 30 acre brush clearing project were both negative (Nightengale and Roemer 1995a: 60). The
investigations of the house structures (Nightengale and Roemer 1995b: 72) resulted in the recording of
two new historic sites, 41FY517 and 41FY518. The house at 41FY517 was built in 1907 but had been
extensively remodeled and had fallen into disrepair. The house at 41FY518 was a 1960s ranch house
located where a previous house, constructed around 1907, once stood. Both structures were deemed
ineligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and for SAL status and were removed.
Throughout 1995, LCRA archaeologists surveyed several small areas around Lake Fayette where well
pads had been proposed (Nightengale and Utley 1995). During one of these surveys, historic material was
noted and flagged for avoidance but the site was not formally recorded and a full investigation was set
aside for the future, as the site itself would not be impacted by well pad construction. This historic
material has been determined to be the same as that seen in the 2016 brush clearing survey and recorded
as site 41FY587. Five negative shovel tests were placed at the well pad site during the 1995 survey.
Also in 1995, a survey was conducted for the construction of a bike path paralleling the lake shore
between Oak Thicket and Park Prairie Parks (Nightengale 1995). A 30 meter wide corridor was surveyed
for the path along its route, including several shovel probes, and no cultural materials were observed. The
proposed 2016 brush clearing project abuts and surrounds much of this path corridor. The 1995 greenbelt
corridor project was the last investigation undertaken in this area until a 2015 LCRA brush clearing
project.
In 2015, as part of its ongoing lands management plan, the LCRA undertook a brush clearing project of
123 acres on lands including and immediately to the west of LCRAâs Oak Thicket Park on Lake Fayette.
Of these, 88 acres had been previously surveyed, leaving two areas of one acre each, and an area of 33
246

acres to be surveyed, all three of which had mapped historic structures. As a result of the 2015 survey
(Larsen et al. 2015), the vicinity of the western periphery of site 41FY86 was visited, two isolated historic
artifact scatters were discovered, and a new site, 41FY586, a historic trash scatter associated with a barn
location, was recorded.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Following a map and file review, it was determined that a research design consisting of identifying and
surveying high probability areas for any unknown archaeological site was appropriate for the project.
Two areas of high probability for historic materials, each approximately four acres in size, were
determined based on historical maps. The remaining 82 acres were determined to be of low probability
for both historic and prehistoric materials based on their location and soil composition. Drainages were
determined to be of low probability for prehistoric materials due to their location in the far uplands and
their ephemeral nature, as has been noted previously (Nightengale 1995:84, Jackson and Skelton
1975:17). A six acre area around the largest mapped drainages was submitted to surface survey to test the
predictive model.
Work was carried out by teams of two to three archaeologists conducting pedestrian survey accompanied
by standard shovel testing of high probability areas, in accordance with CTA standards of one shovel test
per 3 acres on a project area between 11 and 100 acres in size. Locational information was recorded on
GPS with typical 3 m accuracy. Shovel test data was recorded on standardized paper and electronic media
forms. No artifacts were collected.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
After it was determined that the project area had a low probability for prehistoric materials, LCRA
Cultural Resources staff focused on two areas of high probability for historic material based on USGS
topo maps and previous investigations (Nightengale 1995). Cultural materials were observed at both high
probability areas, as a result of which two new sites were recorded, site 41FY587 and site 41FY588. Both
of these sites are early- to mid-twentieth century farmsteads.

Site 41FY587
Site 41FY587 is an early- to mid-twentieth century farmstead, approximately 330 ft long east-west and
nearly 330 ft wide north-south at the widest point (Figure 121). The 1981 USGS topo map of the site area
() indicates a short drive off a rural road which no longer exists. At the end of the drive to the east is a
house and across the drive to the west are two barns.

247

Figure 120: House and two barns mapped on 1981 USGS topo map.

The site consists of eight observed concrete features and relatively sparse surface artifacts, the majority of
which are sheet metal fragments ranging from 8 to 24 inches in size and concentrated at two or three
locations. Feature 1 () is a roughly 10 ft x 15 ft concrete foundation with a raised border and a 5 ft x 8 ft
small concrete slab ten feet to the west. At the corners of Feature 1 and in the center on the long axis are
piers of firebrick marked âT.F.B. Co.â There is a scatter of metal at the north corner, including ring pulltab cans, and a sign for RC Cola. Farther west is a fenceline in a very low fence dune with the remains of
a cedar post and barbed wire fence, which incorporates hog wire to the north. These fence remains
continue southwest and branch off to the east. This off-branch separates two small cedar and corrugated
metal animal shelters, of which the northern shelter has collapsed and the southern shelter (Figure 123)
remains standing.
Another small fenceline separates the shelters and runs to a larger concrete foundation feature, Feature 4.
This concrete foundation is divided by raised concrete thresholds into three partitions: two end partitions
of the same size and a larger central partition. Artifacts were observed at both the north and south ends of
the foundation. At the south end was a cobble marked with the number â4â, the purpose of which was not
readily discernable, and which may have been natural. At the north end of the foundation was a scatter of
metal, mostly sheet metal, but including a 1971 Texas license plate. Between Features 1 and 4 is a long 4
ft x 20 ft rectangular concrete slab, designated Feature 2, which exhibits the same orientation along the
long axis as Feature 1. To the west between Feature 4 and the fenceline, sits a round, approximately 6-ftdiameter concrete foundation with a raised collar, designated Feature 3 (Figure 124). This may be the

248

foundation for a silo, but is more likely for a cistern, based on cisterns of similar construction in the area
(Figure 125).
To the east, across the mapped drive, are more concrete features and artifact scatters. Approximately 100
ft southeast of Feature 4 is a concrete windmill pad designated Feature 5 (Figure 127). The bases of the
windmill frame struts remain at the corners of the pad and a date of July 25, 1925 is incised into the
concrete. Roughly ten feet north of Feature 5 is a small scatter of sheet metal and roughly fifty feet
southwest of the feature are a small milkglass sherd and a brown-glazed ceramic insulator for a
distribution power line marked âGE MADE IN USA.â This insulator consists of a hollow stem threaded
into a cap. Under the cap is a rubber gasket and a short length of the line remains protruding.

Figure 121: Sketch map of site 41FY587; well access path and gravel pad to east.

Approximately 25 feet east of Feature 5 is a 10 ft x 15 ft concrete foundation border, designated Feature
6. A shovel probe indicated the concrete is a raised border only with no interior slab. Approximately 3040 ft southeast of Feature 6 is a surface scatter of several pipe fragments, including: one Â½â diameter
threaded pipe protruding from the ground surface, a roughly one foot length of three-inch pipe, and
another length of the same size pipe threaded into a coupling. About 10 ft southeast of the pipe scatter
was a surface depression, which was at first thought to be a collapsed cistern. A shovel probe revealed the
area to consist of pea gravel fill, which may indicate a filled cistern, a large utilities trench of some sort,
or perhaps a septic feature.
Another 60-70 ft beyond the depression is a concrete step designated Feature 7. A whiteware fragment
with a scalloped interior base (Figure 126) was observed two feet southeast of the step. Another 40 ft
249

south of Feature 7 is another concrete step designated Feature 8. This step is of more primitive
manufacture than Feature 7 and appears to have been overturned. The step itself is to one side rather than
centered and appears to have been poured around a large dressed limestone block, using a lower quality
concrete. This was the last feature observed at site 41FY587.

Figure 122: Feature 1 facing southwest; note firebrick pier in the corner.

On-site work consisted of an initial surface survey through dense vegetation of thorny brush and vines to
discover the extent of the site. Once the surficial features and artifacts were recorded, three shovel tests
were placed at 30 meter intervals along the long axis of the site at the areas of estimated highest
likelihood for subsurface artifacts. Shovel test 1 was placed at the center of the concrete foundation
features to the northwest. Shovel test 2 was placed between Feature 5, the windmill pad, and Feature 6.
Shovel test 3 was placed at Feature 7 near the observed surface artifact. The shovel tests were all negative
and revealed the soil to be only about 8 cm of loamy topsoil over dense clay loam.
Once fieldwork was completed, more detailed research was undertaken of the location of site 41FY587
and the land upon which it sits. LCRA transaction records revealed the site to be on a nearly 200 acre
tract of land owned by the family of the late Charles Hilsher, 17 acres of which were purchased by LCRA
in 1975 for the construction of the Lake Fayette cooling reservoir for the Fayette Power Project. Research
into the Fayette County deed records in La Grange enabled LCRA Cultural Resources staff to construct a
history of the land.
Site 41FY587 sits on land originally granted in 1832 to John M. Hensley, a member of Stephen F.
Austinâs colony, from the Mexican government (Texas General Land Office [TxGLO] 2016). As
mentioned above, the Hensley League was divided up and sold by 1834. The title chain is somewhat
unclear after 1832, but the land was purchased sometime prior to 1866 by Christian and Ana Olmstead of
250

New York City, who appear to have been land speculators, as they owned and then sold numerous tracts
in the area at this time. In 1866, William and Henrietta Ratgen bought 79 Â¼ acres (vol. R, p. 401) and 12
acres (vol. T, p. 30) from the Olmsteads including improvements, which were not described. The Ratgens
owned the land for 24 years until they sold it to Ignaz Holub in 1890. Holub owned the land for 17 years,
during which time he donated 1/8 of an acre in the far northwest corner to the Hackebeil School (vol. 64,
p. 84). In 1907, Holub sold the land to Fritz Treybig Jr. (vol. 84, p. 122). The Treybigs were, at this time,
buying numerous abutting tracts in the area. After Treybig died, his heirs sold the land in 1945 to Joseph
LaCoke (vol. 198, p.493) who then sold the land in 1948 to Charles and Albina Hilsher (vol 226, p. 371).
This is the first of several land purchases the Hilshers make, mostly from various Treybigs, to consolidate
a nearly 200 acre tract of their own.

Charles Hilsher (originally HilÅ¡er) was born, according to U.S. Census records, in Bohemia (part of
Austria at that time) and immigrated to the United States in 1901 at the age of eleven. In 1910, he was
recorded as a servant in the Halamicek household. John Halamicek founded the town of Roznov around
1885, naming it after his birthplace (Carroll 2010). Charles married John Halamicekâs daughter, Albina,
in 1912 and they appear to have lived near Warrenton, based on U.S. Census records. By 1940 five of
their eight children were living in Houston and the youngest three children would soon follow. In late
1948, Charles and Albina bought the land on which site 41FY587 sits. They may have lived at the house
at site 41FY587 (Figure 128) for a time, but just over one year later they bought another house and
several acres of land adjacent to and south of their first tract. In late 1949 or early 1950, they moved into
this house at the southern edge of their land just off TX-159 in Park, Texas. The land where the southern
house was located is now LCRAâs Park Prairie Park, though the house was bought by the Hilsher children
and removed in the early 1980s.

Figure 128: House at site 41FY587 facing southwest; note windmill and roof water cistern; to the left is a small
chicken house.

Site 41FY587 consists of what was a second house to the north, with outbuildings. At the time LCRA
purchased the property from the Hilsher family, this house was rented to a farmhand, who managed the
livestock and land for the Hilshers. This house and the outbuildings were removed at an unknown time
after the LCRA purchased the land.
254

According to LCRA records, the house was built in 1935 and was of box construction with a corrugated
steel roof and a foundation of concrete blocks. The house plan is an L-shape, with 3 bedrooms, a hall, a
kitchen and pantry, a bathroom, a screened in porch, and an unfinished second story, except for the
flooring, used as a sleeping area. Feature 6, a rectangular concrete border of unknown function, seems to
have been located near the kitchen, as are the pipe remains. The covered front porch faced west to the
drive and there was a windmill (Feature 5) just to the north of the porch. The house had two steps, which
may be Features 7 and 8. If they are, they appear to have been moved to the south. Behind the house, to
the east, was a round roof water catchment cistern and a small chicken house. No observed features or
artifacts are associated with this area.
Across the drive were two structures, the northern was a barn for the storage of feed and stock, and the
southern was a slightly smaller barn and stock shed. Feature 1, the concrete foundation with brick piers
and a small slab immediately to the west, and Feature 2, a long rectangular concrete slab, appear to be at
the location of the northern barn. According to pictures taken in 1975, the slab appears to be a covered
porch-like area (Figure 129). Feature 4, the concrete slab with three partitions, appears to be at the
location of the southern barn (Figure 130). Feature 3, the circular concrete foundation, does not appear on
any records, but is likely for a cistern catching water off the roof of the southern barn.

Figure 129: North barn at site 41FY587 facing northwest from drive; south barn is out of frame to the left.

255

Figure 130: South barn at site 41FY587 facing northwest from drive near the house.

Finally, there was a stock shed and a granary or crib in the fields several hundred feet to the south, in the
vicinity of which no features or artifacts were observed. The outlines of these buildings are shown in
Figure 131.
Given the dates of construction for the house (1935) and the windmill foundation (1925) it seems
reasonable to assume the house and outbuildings may have been the residence of Fritz Treybig Jr. and his
family. Based on the history of this and surrounding tracts, this may have also been the location of Ignaz
Holubâs residence, though this is highly speculative.
The remains observed during the 2016 survey match well with the historical records. The locations of the
western features including the fences and pens match those of the two barns, including animal pens,
shelters and a cistern for water. The power distribution line insulator matches the mapped end of the drive
and seems a likely location for a distribution pole to the house and maybe to the barns. The pipe scatter,
surface depression, and concrete steps correspond with the house location, and two steps are noted in the
house plan. The lack of any large structures or structural debris, and lack of artifacts generally, indicates
the house and barns were likely removed intact or destroyed and the debris removed. Based on their
location it is likely the steps were pushed aside during the removal of the house. The time diagnostic
materials consisted of several ring pull tab cans, which were common from 1965 to 1985, and the 1971
Texas license plate, as well as the windmill foundation dated to 1925. This corresponds to records
indicating an early to late mid-twentieth century occupation.

The histories of the families who owned this land fit well into the historical narrative of post-Civil War
Czech and German immigration to the area. Late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century changes in
agricultural practices are also illustrated here, as large tracts of land were subdivided and sold to small
farmers, such as the Holubs and Treybigs. The movement of the Hilsher children away from the country
and into Houston is indicative of the broader mid-twentieth century trend of population movements from
rural areas to cities.
Site 41FY587 is in very poor condition overall. The site is perhaps 1-5 percent intact and overgrown with
dense vegetation. The cultural material present is very sparse and consists almost entirely of smallish
fragments of sheet metal of relatively recent age. The history of this area since 1925, the earliest
verifiable date of occupation, is already very well documented and site 41FY587 provides no new or
valuable information. The sole point of interest is that this land was once owned by Albina and Charles
Hilsher, the daughter and son-in-law of the founder of nearby Roznov, John Halamicek. Taking all factors
into consideration, LCRA Cultural Resources staff assesses site 41FY587 to be of low research value.
LCRA Cultural Resources recommends site 41FY587 be ineligible for formal SAL designation. No
avoidance measures or special considerations are required. LCRA Cultural Resources will recommend,
however, against the use of large mechanical brush clearing methods in order to prevent unnecessary
negative impact to remaining features.

257

Site 41FY588
Site 41FY588 is an early- to late-mid twentieth century farmstead site and is approximately 700 ft long
northeast to southwest and 450 wide northwest to southeast (Figure 132). The site sits on the very tip of a
peninsula jutting out into the Lake Fayette cooling reservoir. The site boundaries encompass observed
artifactual material and mapped structure locations just offshore. LCRA Cultural Resources staff believe,
based on historical USGS topo maps and LCRA archived records, it is likely the site may even extend
several hundred feet farther to the south and southwest. This area is under Lake Fayetteâs maintained pool
level of 390 feet msl, however, and is therefore unavailable for survey.

Figure 132: Sketch map of site 41FY588, including mapped historic structures, now inundated.

The observed material at site 41FY588 consisted of three standing cedar fence posts (Figure 133) trending
east to west and a few clear flat glass fragments next to the east-most fence post. The fence posts had wire
nails in them and the flat glass appeared to be only lightly patinated.
USGS topo maps from 1981 and 1958 indicate the presence of at least a house and a barn prior to
inundation. LCRA archives show a house (Figure 135) built in 1935, a barn built in 1940, a garage or
shop built in 1950, two chicken houses, and several other outbuildings (Figure 134). The five mentioned
buildings all had metal roofs and concrete foundations. The buildings were most likely removed prior to
inundation to prevent them creating an underwater hazard and also because, given the gentle slope at this
location, they would have likely been only partially inundated, leaving the roofs above water. When the
LCRA bought the land in 1975, the farm was described as âthe most versatile farming operation in the
258

area, having cattle, hogs, turkeys, ducks, geese, guineas, fruit trees (peach, plum, and pear), pecan trees,
and timber for use on the farm â¦ and has two very fine, clear water, stock water pondsâ (LCRA
1974:20). At that time, the land belonged to Steve C. and Gladys Mae Urban, who had owned it since
1950, when they bought it from Alvin L. Treybig (vol. 241, p. 445) with the help of the Slavonic
Benevolent Order of the State of Texas (SPJST), in the form of a deed of trust, which is similar to a
mortgage.

Figure 133: Site 41FY588, facing south; two of three remaining cedar fence posts in center; note proximity to water
and washed up debris.

The title goes back to 1832 when John M. Hensley received a league of land, as discussed above. In 1834,
after the Hensley League was quartered, George W. Barnett purchased two tracts: the western quarter
league and a large portion of the eastern quarter league encompassing 731 acres. Barnett appears to be
George Washington Barnett, who was a prominent early Texan. According to the following from the
Handbook of Texas Online (Kemp 2010), Barnett was born in South Carolina in 1793, studied medicine
and moved to Texas in 1834. He was involved in the founding of the Municipality of Washington in
1835, was active during the Texas Revolution, and was a senator in the Republic of Texas. He was killed
by Lipan-Apache while deer hunting near Gonzales in 1848. The records are unclear, but the land seems
to have been divided and conveyed among various members of the Barnett family until 1891.
259

In 1891, the land appears to have left the Barnett family as a result of a court case. By this time the tract
on which site 41FY588 sits had been whittled down to 94 acres. A judgement was rendered in 1891 in the
case of M.H. Parr and Wife vs. Frank Barnett et al. (case no. 4395) regarding the 94 acre tract. Records
indicate that M.H. Parr may have been Milligan Henry Parr who married Sara Evaline Barnett, and that
Frank Barnett et al. may have been their children, Frank, Laura, and Sam, using their motherâs maiden
name. Court minutes did not detail the particulars of the case but the decision of the court was to create a
commission to sell the 94 acres and award one quarter of the proceeds to each of the three Barnetts and
the final one quarter to M.H. Parr and his wife. As a result of this, the land was purchased in 1893 by
Joseph Orsak (vol. 48, p. 77) who then sold it to Frank Orsak in 1894 (vol. 55, p. 423). In 1896, Frank
Orsak sold the land to Peter Kulhanek (vol. 58, p. 4) who owned the tract for 16 years. Either in 1915 or
previously, Kulhanek subdivided the 94 acre tract, and, in 1915, sold 63 5/8 (63.63) acres to Emil and
Mary M. Prasifka (vol. 100, p. 240). According to his World War One draft registration papers, Emil was
working land near Park, Texas, which is most likely these 63.63 acres, but by 1919 he sold the tract to
Edward and Elizabeth Knippel (vol. 109, p. 490) and moved to nearby Fayetteville. The Knippels owned,
and presumably worked, the land for 27 years until 1946, when they sold it to Alvin L. Treybig (vol. 202,
p. 133), who sold it in 1948 to the Urbans, as mentioned above.

Figure 134: Layout and outline of structures on Urban tract prior to destruction and inundation. Unfortunately, what
the structures are (barn, house, etc) were not recorded.

260

It is clear from the title chain that this 63.63 acre tract changed hands many times since 1832. It is
tempting to conclude that all those who owned it for only a short time were land speculators, but the
experience of Emil Prasifka indicates that even a short term owner may have been personally working the
land before deciding to sell it. It appears that the majority of the improvements at site 41FY588 were
made by the Knippels and the Urbans, although these may have built on improvements by previous
owners, who possibly resided at this location. The scant archaeological remains support a relatively
modern early- to late-mid twentieth century interpretation of the site. It is currently impossible, or at least
infeasible, to submit the inundated portions of the site to further archaeological investigations.

Figure 135: Urban house, constructed in 1935, at site 41FY588, facing northeast; house was of box construction
with a metal roof and a concrete foundation.

The 63.63 acre Urban tract, upon which site 41FY588 sits, has, aside from a possible connection to
George Washington Barnett, no other connection to prominent historical figures or events. It is interesting
to note, however, that a Charles Hackebeil was a member of the 1891 commission appointed to execute

261

the decision in the case of M.H. Parr and Wife vs Frank Barnett et al., and that he may have had a role in
the creation of the Hackebeil School mentioned above.
As with site 41FY587 to the northwest, the history of the owners of the land on which site 41FY588 is
located, is illustrative of late-nineteenth century immigration of German and Czech small farmers into the
region. The sparse material observed at site 41FY588 is, however, of a later, mid-twentieth century date
and provides no new or important information into this well-documented time period.
The portions of the site available for survey are in very poor condition, with less than 1 percent of the site
intact. The scant archaeological materials and the well documented history of the area lead LCRA
Cultural Resources staff to assess the exposed portion of 41FY588 to be of little research value. The
current, formal boundaries of site 41FY588 are restricted to the dry land surveyed in 2016, but the
majority of the site lies underwater and therefore unavailable for assessment. This fact leads the LCRA
Cultural Resources staff to recommend that site 41FY588 remain of undetermined eligibility for formal
designation as an SAL, until such time as it can be assessed for materials predating the turn of the
century.
Although the majority of site 41FY588 lies too close to the shoreline to be affected by the 2016 brush
clearing project, LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommend no special considerations or avoidance
measures be required for any area of the site that may be cleared of vegetation.
Other Surveyed Areas
LCRA Cultural Resources staff surveyed areas (Figure 136) around three mapped drainages, totaling six
and a half acres, in order to assess the nature of the drainages and to test the predictive model used in the
research design. Survey confirmed these to be ephemeral drainages on non-aggrading landforms in an
upland setting on sediments of Miocene and Pliocene age. No shovel tests were placed due to ground
surface visibility averaging between 75 percent and 100 percent. No prehistoric materials were observed.
Several cedar fence posts were observed at the largest drainage and were determined to be associated with
a mid-twentieth century farmstead located outside LCRA lands. With no other materials observed, these
fence remains were considered to be an isolated find.

visibility.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In June of 2016, LCRA Cultural Resources staff completed an intensive survey in advance of a proposed
brush clearing project set for the fall of 2016 on approximately 90 acres of LCRA/COA owned lands in
Fayette County on the north shore of Lake Fayette between LCRAâs Oak Thicket and Park Prairie Parks.
A file and map search located two high probability areas of approximately 4 acres each to be surveyed,
based on historic structures plotted on USGS topographic maps. Several upland ephemeral streams in the
project area were also subjected to surficial survey for prehistoric material. The total area surveyed
comprised 14.3 acres. The remaining 75.7 acres were determined to be of low probability for both
prehistoric and historic material and were not surveyed.
Background research and previous investigations indicated a high likelihood of recovering historic
artifacts, due to mapped structures in the project area and because of the long history of settlement in the
area by Europeans beginning in the 1830s. Research also indicated a low likelihood of recovering any
significant prehistoric artifacts, due to the upland non-aggrading nature of the area and the relatively long
distance from significant prehistoric water sources, near which prehistoric sites are often found (Collins
2004, Jackson and Skelton 1975, Nightengale 1995:84). As a result of the 2016 survey two new early- to
late-mid twentieth century farmstead sites were recorded, site 41FY587 and site 41FY588.

263

The two areas of high probability for historic cultural materials were determined based on mapped
structures in the project area. The northern high probability area sits between a disused well pad to the
south and a disused gravel lot to the east. Historic material was noted during the 1995 well pad survey
(Nightengale 1995) and flagged for avoidance but not formally recorded. During the 2016 survey of
roughly 3.75 acres in this area, eight concrete features, several fencelines and fence posts, two animal
shelters, and surficial artifacts, mostly sheet metal, were observed. This historic farmstead was designated
site 41FY587 and the site boundaries were based on the extent of observed surface materials. Three
shovel tests were placed in a northwest to southeast line and spaced approximately 30 m apart at the
locations of estimated highest use. All three shovel tests were negative and revealed an 8 cm topsoil A
horizon over a dense clay loam B horizon. Site 41FY587 was determined to be of low research value and
recommended ineligible for formal designation as an SAL. No special considerations or avoidance
measures are deemed necessary at this site.
The southeastern high probability area is mapped right at the shoreline of the Lake Fayette cooling
reservoir and consists of a house and a barn. LCRA Cultural Resources staff surveyed an area of roughly
4 acres between the inter-park trail and the shoreline. At the mapped site it was determined that the
majority of the site lay under the waters of Lake Fayette. Only three cedar fence posts with wire nails and
s small scatter of very lightly patinated clear flat glass was observed at the shoreline. No shovel tests were
placed due to the water-logged soil and the lack of observed surficial materials. Additionally, much
material had washed up on the shore over the years, destroying any clear distinction between any possibly
in situ materials and flotsam.
Due to the observed scant fence remains and the mapped inundated structures it was decided to designate
this inundated historic farmstead as site 41FY588. The site boundary was set as a circle with a diameter of
250 feet, centered on the fence posts, and encompassing the dry land portions of the site. Because the
majority of the site is underwater and unavailable for survey at present, LCRA Cultural Resources
assesses site 41FY588 to be of low research value but recommends it should remain of undetermined
eligibility for designation as an SAL. No special considerations or avoidance measures are deemed
necessary for the present project.
During the 2016 survey, only mid twentieth century historic materials of low research value and
absolutely no prehistoric materials were recovered. Taken in conjunction with previous investigations,
especially the 1995 greenbelt corridor and gas well projects, the 2016 survey resulted in the
recommendation by LCRA Cultural Resources staff that no avoidance measures or special conditions be
required and the brush clearing project should be allowed to proceed using mechanical methods,
including the use of bulldozers and skid-steers mounted with shears or Seppi mulchers. LCRA Cultural
Resources staff will, however, recommend voluntary avoidance or less destructive mechanical clearing
methods at site 41FY587 in accordance with cultural resource protection and management goals on
LCRA-owned and managed lands. There is nothing to avoid at 41FY588.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing a tear down and rebuild of its existing T-233
Henne-to-McCarty Lane transmission line, which runs from the Henne Substation to the McCarty Lane
East Substation in eastern Comal County and southern Hays County, Texas (Figure 137 and Figure 138).
The transmission line is approximately 6.5 miles (10.5 kilometer [km]) in length and occupies a 100-feet
(ft) (30 meter [m]) -wide easement, totaling almost 80 acres. The project will consist of the removal and
replacement of 38 existing support structures. The new structures will be placed within approximately 3
m of the current locations within undisturbed soils. A 30- to 36-inch auger will be employed to drill the
new holes to depths of over 6 ft. Other impacts may involve the modification of the banks of intermittent
streams to improve existing vehicle crossings.
Roughly 1.3 miles (2.1 km) of the 100-ft-wide easement, totaling 15.8 acres, have been surveyed
previously, so a cultural resources assessment was necessary for the remaining distance. The assessment
consisted of a map and file review followed by an intensive cultural resources survey of high probability
areas (HPA), both prehistoric and historic, that could be impacted by construction activities.
Approximately 1.1 linear miles (1.8 km) of 100-ft-wide right of way, totaling 13.7 acres, was identified as
HPA. Nine proposed tower locations are located within these areas, and were surveyed by LCRA Cultural
Resources staff on September 1, 2016, using standard survey and subsurface testing methods. The Texas
Historical Commissionâs minimum state survey standards were not met due to the paucity of soils, high
surface visibility, and the targeting of proposed areas to be subjected to subsurface disturbances.
One previously undocumented archeological site, 41HY533, was recorded during the
course of the survey. Site 41HY533 represents the partial remains of a historic
farmstead likely dating from the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. The
portion of the site recorded within the right of way is recommended as ineligible for
formal SAL status, while the status of portions of the site outside the right of way
remain unknown.
The cultural resource investigations were conducted under the terms of LCRAâs annual blanket State
Antiquities Permit 7531 in accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and the Memorandum of
Understanding between the Texas Historical Commission and LCRA. There is no known or anticipated
federal funding or permitting involved with this project. No artifacts were collected during the project;
project records will be submitted to an accredited curation facility.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located in eastern Comal County and southern Hays County, Texas, southwest of San
Marcos, Texas. The project is located within the York Creek and Caney Creek drainages, parts of the
larger Guadalupe River watershed. Elevations within the project area range between 559 and 683 ft
above).

mean sea level. Vegetation in the area is typified by cropland at the juncture of the Blackland Prairie and
the Edwards Plateau (McMahan et al. 1984
Surface geology in the upland areas along the transmission corridor consists of Upper Pleistocene-aged
Pecan Gap Chalk, Upper Taylor Marl, and Fluviatile terrace deposits (Barnes 1974). Soils of the HeidenHouston Black associations are found throughout the project area (Batte 1984). Within the HPAs, these
are dominated by the Heiden, Houston Black, and Tinn series. Heiden clays are nearly level to moderately
steep and are found on base slopes and interfluve shoulders. These dark grayish brown clays formed a
clayey residuum weathered from mudstone and have an A-horizon that extends to a depth of 46
centimeters (cm) below ground surface. Soils of the Houston Black series formed in Cretaceous-age
clayey residuum and are found on interfluves and upland ridges. The A-horizon typically measures 20 cm
in depth, terminating in basal clay. In contrast, Tinn clays occur on nearly level floodplains, having
formed in calcareous clayey alluvium. They possess Holocene-age deposits approximately 46 cm in
thickness.
The T-233 transmission line was originally constructed in 1935, and the 100-ft-wide right of way has
since been modified and cleared of major vegetation. Visible impacts to the project area are
predominantly plowing and terracing of cropland, land clearing around rural residences, and the original
land clearing and ongoing maintenance activities along the transmission line corridor. Although the right
of way is subjected to periodic maintenance, it is currently overgrown with low to medium grasses and
ubiquitous young mesquite bushes

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Hays and Comal counties presently have over 500 and 300 recorded archaeological
sites, respectively (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas), which can safely be described as
encompassing all presently recognized cultural periods. Several cultural resources
projects have been conducted within 0.6 miles (1 km) of the current project area.
The most pertinent of these is the 2002 survey of the Henne Spur Transmission Line (T-233) in Comal
and Hays counties conducted by LCRA (Prikryl and Goode 2002). This consisted of intensive cultural
resource survey of select portions of the T-233 transmission line having moderate to high probabilities for
cultural resource sites. Two new sites, 41CM250 and 41CM251, were recorded, both comprising light
lithic scatters consisting of chert debitage observed at surface to a depth of 30 cm below ground surface.
Both sites were determined ineligible for listing on the NRHP or as SALs.
The HPAs covered within the current report have not been subjected to cultural resources investigations.
No sites were previously identified within these HPAs. Table 17 summarizes known archaeological sites
within 1 km of the project area.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Prehistoric
The project area is considered to be in the central Texas archeological region (Ellis et al. 1995). Central
Texas prehistory has typically been divided into four main subdivisions, known variably as eras or
periods, which are subdivided further into phases or subperiods. These subdivisions combine to begin to
describe 11,500 years of history. A longstanding chronology of Prewitt (1981, 1985) has been revised by
Johnson and Goode (1994), who utilized new lines of evidence based on climatic and geomorphological
data to redefine period divisions. This can be contrasted with Collins (1995), who indicates climatic
variables at times were somewhat different than those of Johnson and Goode. A more detailed prehistoric
culture history will be with the final version of this report.
Historic
From the late seventeenth through the mid-nineteenth centuries, the present San
Marcos area lay on the Camino de los Tejas and the Camino de Arriba routes of the
Camino Reales (Kings Highways) that connected San Antonio with newly established
settlements in east Texas. The first Europeans to describe the San Marcos area in
much detail were the members of the Espinosa-Olivares-Auguirre Expedition of 1709
(Gonzales 1982). Later, the San Xavier mission and presidio were briefly located at the
San Marcos springs in 1755 and 1756. However, the first serious Spanish attempt at a
more permanent settlement at San Marcos did not occur until 1808 and it ended in
failure several years later (Cecil and Greene 1996:520). Subsequently, permanent
settlement was realized in the 1820s and 1830s when the Mexican government issued
land grants to a number of individuals. For example, in 1835 Thomas G. McGehee
acquired a Spanish land grant and began farming north of San Marcos.
274

Hays County was established in 1848 from land carved out of the existing Travis County, and named for
Texas Ranger Jack C. Hays (LCRA files). The countyâs population was over 2,000 by 1860, and rose to
over 14,000 by 1900. Agriculture and ranching have always been the predominate industries throughout
the history of the county, but beginning in the 1960s educational facilities such as Southwest Texas State
University and Gary Job Corps began playing an increasing role in the economic base of the area. Within
the area of the future Comal County, the short-lived Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe Mission was
established by the Spanish in 1756 (Greene 2016). Later, the area was largely settled by Germans, and
Comal County was formally established in 1846. While the historically dominant industries are
agriculture and ranching, tourism has become a primary industry in the modern era.
Historic site types in the Hays and Comal counties area include home, farm, and ranch-steads, Spanish
military, ecclesiastic, and civil settlements, engineering features, battle sites, industrial sites, as well as
trash dumps and debris scatters (Jurgens 1996:5).

METHODOLOGY
The project was designed to identify and assess archaeological sites that might be
eligible for formal listing as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL). All work was
conducted under blanket TAC Permit 7531 and terms of the memorandum of
understanding between THC and LCRA, which incorporates CTA survey and reporting
standards.
Following a review of geology, soils, recent and historical maps, and previous investigations, 1.1 linear
miles (1.8 km) of HPA were identified for potential prehistoric and historic sites. Prehistoric HPAs were
based on proximity to natural water resources and topography, and historic HPAs were based on aerial
photographs and historic map research. HPAs were covered by pedestrian survey, with subsurface testing
conducted within 3 m of the existing tower locations within those areas.
Shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm levels to subsoil or a depth of 120 cm, whichever was reached first.
Soils were screened through 0.25-inch mesh unless dominated by clay, in which case they were sorted by
hand. Artifacts were recorded, but were not collected. Instead, artifacts were reinterred within the shovel
test following completion.

RESULTS
Portions of the T-233 transmission line possessing a high probability for encountering cultural resources
sites were surveyed by LCRA archaeologists on September 1, 2016. Four areas of prehistoric HPA and
two areas of historic HPA were identified prior to the beginning of fieldwork. These HPAs were
subjected to surface observation, and the nine proposed transmission line structure locations within them
were given particular focus. Shovel tests were not conducted where stream cutbanks provided clear
profile views of the soil profiles, or where ground disturbance was significant. In total, eight shovel tests
275

were excavated, only two of which were positive for cultural materials. These were located on a newly
recorded historic archaeological site, 41HY533.
41HY533
Overview
Site 41HY533 is located within an historic HPA based on the 1931 update of the 1911 USGS San Marcos
topographic map. The map shows two structures in the area of the site, and a house adjacent to the
transmission line appears to be old enough to be at least one of the structures represented. A later review
of maps indicated that the structures are depicted on the 1911 San Marcos topographic map as well. The
site boundary was generated based on the distribution of surficial artifacts, features, and major ground
disturbance from a buried pipeline (Figure 139). The site measures approximately 60 m north to south and
35 m east to west within the right of way, continuing east and west beyond the right of way boundary.
The site is topographically situated on an upland area, with drainages 145 m to the northeast and 410 m to
the southwest. The right of way has a layer of mulched vegetation on the surface and scattered as much as
10 to 20 cm below surface, indicating that right of way maintenance and brush clearing has been ongoing
for some time. Tall grass and thistle make up much of the rest of the ground cover, leaving low visibility
across much of the site. Mesquite trees are abundant and form thickets along the eastern limits of the right
of way. Soils on the site are mapped as belonging to the Houston Black series of clays (Batte 1984), with
basal soils appearing just below the plow zone.
The site consists of a mortared fieldstone and cement collar to either a well or a cistern (Figure 140), a
small scatter of dry-pressed handmade bricks (Figure 141), a buried scatter of cut nails and flat glass, and
sparse surface material (including a piece of stoneware and a fragment of solarized (amethyst) glass
visible on an adjacent dirt track road. Remnants of a fence exist to the east of the stone collar. The collar
has a soft cement or lime mortar top, in which the date "Mar 1942" is scratched, though it is unknown
whether this represents the initial construction date or the date that the concrete cap was added. The
presence of solarized glass and cut nails indicates a very late nineteenth or very early twentieth century
occupation, and this is supported by the handmade bricks. The site very likely extends beyond the right of
way to the northwest and southeast. Other than the brick and nails, no other structural remnants were
located within or immediately adjacent to the right of way. Aerial imagery appears to show other possible
features to the southwest, and an old structure 60 m to the northwest; however, these lie outside the
present right of way and were therefore not evaluated.
Four shovel tests were conducted, indicating buried material in the immediate area of the stone collar
down to 40 cm below ground surface, but the deposits were also clearly disturbed. The artifacts all appear
to be within the plow zone, which overlies undisturbed pre-Holocene soils. A buried pipeline, which
appears to follow the T-233 transmission line for some distance, has a cement surface component to the
immediate north that appears to have caused major ground disturbance. The siteâs north termination was a
result of this disturbance, and there is a lack of surface material visible beyond it

Archival Research
Deed research indicates that the land is part of the Vanhorn survey, which was originally granted to
William H. Vanhorn (sometimes recorded as Van Horn) in 1838, Mr. Vanhorn being a single male who
arrived in Texas before 1836. (Texas General Land Office, Hays County A-464). In many later deeds, Mr.
Vanhorn is recorded as having the property patented to him in December of 1847. While records could
not be located to indicate who owned the property in the intervening years, in 1869 part of the property is
recorded as having been sold by Elizabeth and Francis Flournoy to a Benjamin Netherland, and the deed
appears to indicate that Mr. Netherland had owned the property before and was repurchasing it from the
Flournoys (Hays County deed records G:556). Another Deed record from 1871 shows that Benjamin
Netherland gave 50 acres (later described as 54.73 acres) to his son, Joseph H. Netherland, and that the
land was part of Benjaminâs homestead (Hays County deed records G:133-134). US Census records
indicate that Benjamin Netherland was born in Kentucky, and was in Kentucky during the 1850 US
Census, but was in Hays County and married to Rebecca Netherland during the 1860 US Census.
The section of the property given to Joseph H. Netherland was bought in 1910 by a Will. G. Barber from
an M. R. Netherland (Hays County deed records v58:293), who then sold it (at an unknown date) to W. C.
Richards (Hays County deed records v110:402-404). The other part of the property in question was sold
in two parts by a J. B. and Belle Netherland to Enoch and Annie Wilson in 1915 (Hays County deed
records v68:332), and to L. G. and Katherine Johnson in 1916 (Hays County deed records v70:335). L. G.
Johnson bought the portion owned by the Wilsons in November of 1916 (Hays County deed records
v70:402). W. C. Richards bought these two portions from the Johnsons in 1920 (Hays County deed
records v81:102), and as mentioned previously, also purchased adjoining property from Will. G. Barber.
Later deeds refer to these three tracts within the property and describe them together as being 170 acres of
land from the William Vanhorn Patent.
In 1935, following a court case against W. C. and Alma Richards by an Iowa based insurance company,
Bankers Life, local Sheriff M. M. Wren seized and auctioned the 170 acres, where it was purchased by
the Bankers life Company (Hays County deed records v110:402-404). LCRA internal files indicate that
the Texas Power and Light Company purchased a transmission line easement on the property from the
Bankers Life Company in 1935, and this easement is the same that is owned by LCRA today. In June of
1940, Bankers Life sold the property to Claude L. and Ola Harris for $20,000 (Hays County deed records
v120:490-492), and they owned the property until 1955 (Hays County deed records v165:634)

Conclusion and Recommendations
The artifactual material would appear to indicate a turn of the century occupation, which would indicate
that the material was deposited while the Netherland Family owned the property, and may even be related
to Benjamin Netherlandâs homestead, or that of one of his sons. The 1942 date on the cement of the well
or cistern would indicate that it was either built or modified when the Harrisâs owned the property.
While 41HY533 is located in the T-233 right of way corridor, there are currently no transmission line
structures within the defined site boundary, and the proposed project does not include placing one within
279

the boundary. While transmission line work crews will pass through the site, there should be little to no
impact to features and deposits. Because of clear disturbance of subsurface deposits and the sparse nature
of the cultural material, the primary research value of the site within the right of way is locational.
Additionally, the archival research has found no indication that site 41HY533 is associated significantly
with any historical event, famous person, or important principle or ideal. For these reasons, LCRA
Cultural Resources staff recommends that site 41HY533 be considered ineligible for formal SAL status
within the right of way. Portions of the site that extend beyond the right of way were not investigated, and
are recommended as being of undetermined SAL status.

SUMMARY
LCRA Cultural Resources staff conducted an intensive cultural resources assessment of 1.1 linear miles
(1.8 km) of HPA in preparation for the proposed upgrade of transmission line T-233. The project operated
within a 100-ft-wide right of way and covered an area of 13.7 acres. The assessment located and recorded
one previously undocumented cultural resource site. Site 41HY533 is a historic site represented by a stone
cistern or well and a thin scatter of domestic and construction debris found on the surface and within the
plow zone. Due to the paucity of artifacts, the poor preservation of site integrity, the shallow soils, and
archival research, the portion of site 41HY533 within the current right of way does not appear to meet the
criteria for designation as an SAL.
LCRA Cultural Resources staff considers the rebuild of T-233 transmission line to be fully investigated.
Because no SAL-eligible sites will be impacted by construction activities staff recommends that all
currently proposed work be allowed to proceed without restrictions. Standard emergency discovery
procedures will be in place, and should any previously undiscovered cultural resources be discovered in
the course of the rebuild, work in the immediate vicinity of the discovery will cease, and LCRA Cultural
Resources staff will be contacted to determine what, if any, mitigation efforts are necessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to encourage the use of the Shaffer Bend
Recreation Area as a destination park. The project will consist of two primary components: the
development of a 22-acre recreation area and the installation of a 1 kilometer (km) (0.6-mile) water
pipeline to the recreation area from the parkâs entrance. Anticipated impacts within the recreation area
will include extensive vegetation clearing, some minimal grading by heavy machinery, and the
construction of 50 concrete RV pads with associated utilities. While the exact depths of impacts have not
yet been determined, they are anticipated to be less than 0.9 meters (m) (3 feet [ft]) below ground surface.
The water pipeline is also anticipated to extend to a maximum of roughly 0.9 m (3 ft) in depth (Figure
142).
Fieldwork was conducted on three non-consecutive days (September 8, 12, and 14, 2016) by a crew of
three to four LCRA archaeologists. Two previously documented archeological sites, 41BT68 and
41BT483, were revisited during the present survey. Only surface evidence of prehistoric site 41BT68 was
found during the current survey on denuded slopes; the majority of the site within LCRA property has
been heavily dissected by drainages. Prehistoric site 41BT483 was relocated, and its boundaries were
extended based on the results of shovel testing; minimal cultural material was encountered, and no
distinct stratigraphic integrity was present. LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends that both sites be
considered ineligible for formal SAL status within the project area. Portions of the sites extending beyond
the project boundaries were not investigated, and are recommended as being of undetermined SAL status.
The cultural resource investigations were conducted under the terms of LCRAâs annual blanket State
Antiquities Permit 7531 in accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and the Memorandum of
Understanding between the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and LCRA. There is no known or
anticipated federal funding or permitting involved with this project. No artifacts were collected during the
project; project records will be submitted to an accredited curation facility.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Landforms and Vegetation
For this report, a two-part division is used for a more detailed discussion of the landform zones found
within the Shaffer Bend Recreation Area project area. These two zones are the lowland/floodplain and the
upland margin.
Lowland/Floodplain Zone
The lowland/floodplain zone extends from the top of the original banks of the Colorado River at an
elevation of about 656 feet above mean sea level (amsl) up to a height of approximately 710 feet amsl.
This zone consists of Holocene-aged alluvium that is generally thought to have been deposited in the last
10,000 years. It may be as thick as 60 feet. The upper portions of the alluvium appear to consist primarily
of silty loam and loam sediments with a surface veneer of very fine sandy loam to loamy sand. The
deeper portions of the alluvial column are a mixture of sand, clay, and gravel. All of these sediments have
been deposited by flooding of the Colorado River.
While no intensive geomorphic investigations that would provide a detailed history of the alluvial terrace
sequence on this section of the Colorado River have been undertaken, some relevant data have recently
been summarized for the Double Horn Resource Area (located on the opposite bank of the Colorado
River). However, determination of the age of the alluvial terrace system at Shaffer Bend is made difficult
by two factors. First, the veneer of a recent fine sandy loam and loamy sand across the surface of the
lowland/floodplain terrace system hampers study of deeper deposits. Secondly, this terrace is also an
actively developing point bar sequence that mostly likely has multiple depositional suites that would
require intensive geomorphologic investigations to unravel. The discovery and dating of archaeological
sites within the lowland/floodplain zone aid in assessing the ages of the point bar depositional sequence.
A silty loam soil has developed on the alluvium except in certain low-lying areas, perhaps former
backwaters, where the soil tends to be more clayey. Within the project area two soil series have been
mapped: the most extensive are the Weswood series soils which cover the northern two thirds of the
floodplain, while the Karnes series soils are confined to the southern edge of the floodplain (Dittemore
and Allison 1979). Underlying the alluvium are Pennsylvanian-aged sandstone and shale of the
Smithwick formation (Barnes 1981). Soils of the Weswood series have a silty loam Ap-horizon of 10 cm,
overlying silty loam B-horizons to a depth of approximately 160 cm below surface. Beneath those, two
deeply buried A-horizons extend to a depth of roughly 200 cm; these are well below the majority of the
current projectâs proposed impacts. Karnes soils, which occur on footslopes or stream terraces, have a 38cm-thick loam A-horizon above a lighter-colored B-horizon with common films of calcium carbonate.
The lowland/floodplain zone understory vegetation includes bushy bluestem, King Ranch bluestem,
Johnson grass, switchgrass, and Southwestern bristlegrass. On the shoreline areas and in areas exposed
during droughts, rattlebush, Lindheimer senna, clammy weed, and cocklebur are present. The overstory
includes pecan, live oak, honey mesquite, Texas persimmon, and Ashe juniper. These vegetation types
were present at the time of the survey.
288

Upland Margin Zone
The upland margin zone is defined as generally extending from 710 to 800 feet amsl at Shaffer Bend.
The base of the upland margin is steepâa 12- to 25-foot hill slope. At the top of that rise, a terrace that
ranges from flat to slightly rising extends inland for a distance of 300 feet on the west side of the tract
before a second steep hill slope that rises an additional 40 to 60 feet is encountered. On the southern and
eastern flanks of the Shaffer Bend tract, the terrace at the top of the base of the upland margins has
variable topography with flat to gently sloping terrain present except in the vicinity of a tributary creek
system where sharp ravines and gullies have been formed by channel erosion.
Top soils are generally shallow clays, stony loams, and occasional patches of sandy loam. Some lag
gravels, mainly chert and quartzite, are present in these soils. Within the project area, the upland soils are
mapped as belonging to the Hensley series (Dittemore and Allison 1979), with shallow (10 cm) loams
overlying dark reddish brown clay. These variable soils support patches of oak woodlands, but mesquite
trees, tasijilo, bee brush, Ashe juniper, greenbriar, and prickly pear are the predominant vegetation in
areas that were formerly cleared for farming and ranching activities. Various grasses and croton are
common understory plants.
Prior Land Usage
The entire project area was under cultivation at one time or another, beginning in the 1850âs up until the
late 1930s. Noah Smithwick mentions in his memoirs of opening up 100 acres of bottomland (Smithwick
1983) and his land grant overlaps with the extreme western part of the project area. An old fence forms
the northern two thirds of the projectâs eastern boundary following the border between two other original
Texas land grants. Today this fence is nearly buried by a high berm built up by plowing and wind-blown
dirt. A more recent fence lacking a berm runs parallel to the older one 390 m to the west. The area in
between these two fences was under cultivation in 1936 when the LCRA commissioned a detailed
topographic map of the basin of what would become Lake Travis. A modern barbwire fence runs
diagonally across this field, constructed by a cattleman who leased the property from the LCRA.
The vegetation type prior to clearing for agriculture is unrecorded but was probably a savanna with
riparian forest closer to the riverbank. After the fields were abandoned the land was leased for cattle
grazing for several decades during which periodic clearing took place to remove opportunistic species.
Recently an almost impenetrable thicket of mesquite, acacia, juniper, prickly pear, prickly ash, and
tasajillo has taken over the old fields.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Areas of the property adjacent to the river channel may have been included in the survey of the Basin of
Lake Marshall Ford (later renamed Lake Travis) conducted by the University of Texas between 1937 and
1940. No sites were recorded at Shaffer Bend during this survey. A total of 10 other field projects have
subsequently been conducted through the years, which are summarized in the following paragraphs.
289

In 1967 Preston Millican, an LCRA land surveyor at the time and an avocational archaeologist, recorded
four sites in the Shaffer Bend tract (41BT49, 41BT67, 41BT68, and 41BT70). It is not known how much
of the Shaffer Bend acreage Millican investigated.
In 1978 an archeological survey was done for an LCRA fence project associated with grazing leases
(Kegley and Black 1978). The survey passed through one of Millicanâs sites, 41BT70, located on a ridge
top immediately east of 41BT67. The archeologists were impressed by the abundance of sandstone
cobbles scattered across the site, some of which were clustered and thought to be hearths. Also, possible
mortar holes were seen in sandstone outcrops. It is not known how much acreage was covered during this
survey either.
In 1979, archaeologists from Prewitt & Associates conducted a survey along portions of the boundary
fence around Shaffer Bend Park (Prewitt and Kotter 1980). They relocated Millicanâs 41BT68 and
assessed it as potentially significant, recommending avoidance or significance testing. Two years later in
1981, additional parts of the LCRA Shaffer Bend tracts were surveyed by Prewitt & Associates for an
apparent brush clearing project during which the Shaffer-Hood Farmstead (41BT177) was recorded along
with two prehistoric lithic scatters (41BT178 and 41BT179) in the upland margins. It is estimated that
these two surveys probably covered about 220 acres.
Historic site 41BT177 was first shovel tested during the 1994 LCRA Teacher Workshop to search for
activity areas in and around the house remains and to date the occupancy of the site. Since little if any
solarized (amethyst) or aqua bottle glass was recovered, the site probably dates to the 1920s and later,
although the cut nails suggest that the house may have been built earlier. Although the investigations were
mainly concerned with the historic component, a small amount of prehistoric debitage was also recovered.
The following year, the 1995 LCRA Teacher Workshop shovel tested around the house at 41BT67,
recovering historic artifacts of similar age to those from 41BT177. It is estimated that these two
workshops investigated a total area of three acres.
During the severe drought in the year 2000, the LCRA Cultural Resource staff surveyed approximately 20
acres along the Shaffer Bend shoreline and in low-lying areas exposed by the drought as a part of their
yearly inventory work. No cultural resource sites were found.
In 2004, LCRA archeologists surveyed approximately 25 acres during additional park inventory work at
Shaffer Bend. They placed three shovel tests near the terrace edge east of the 41BT177 house site and
found fairly dense concentrations of chipping debris with a few stone tools and some burned rock buried
in the cobbly sediments of the terrace. This material must have worked its way down into the sediments
through bioturbation over a long period of time. During that survey, site 41BT416, a prehistoric upland
lithic procurement site, was also recorded.
Until 2004 no prehistoric sites had been recorded in the lowland/floodplain within the meander of the
river, which includes much of the southern portion of the park. Exploratory trenching with a backhoe late
in 2004 detected a diffuse scatter of chipping debris extending vertically from near the surface down to a
depth of 1.7 m (5.6 feet). This site was recorded as 41BT361. Additional shovel testing the following

290

year found that the site covers nearly 3 acres, but artifact frequencies remained low and consisted entirely
of chipping debris.
A second floodplain site, 41BT428, was recorded in 2007 during a 94-acre LCRA brush clearing project
(Hixson 2007). LCRA archeologists used a mechanical auger to test for buried cultural deposits down to
depths of between 100 and 144cm. Most of the cultural material from 41BT428 came from below 0.8 m
and included both prehistoric and historic (late nineteenth century) artifacts.
When lake levels are low, scattered prehistoric artifacts and burned rocks along with modern trash can be
seen on the steep slope of the lowest terrace at the southwestern edge of the park. In 2005, LCRAâs
Archaeology Services staff shovel tested the slope and terrace edge in proximity to these artifacts without
recovering additional cultural material. It appears that the artifacts washed in from upstream, mixing with
burned rock from recent campfires. Backhoe trenching by LCRA archeologists in 2005 for a 3.5-acre
wildlife pond project on this same terrace further downstream encountered no cultural material; it appears
that these low terrace sediments accumulated too recently to contain intact prehistoric material (Hixson et
al. 2006).
In 2011, LCRA archaeologists surveyed the 11 known sites, found in previous investigations, in the
Shaffer Bend area in order to assess their SAL eligibility (Hixson and Prikryl 2012). The prehistoric
components of four sitesâ41BT49, 41BT68 41BT70, 41BT177âwere placed in the LCRA category of
potentially eligible for formal designation as SALs. Prehistoric site 41BT416, a lithic procurement site,
was also listed as potentially SAL eligible because it had not been intensively explored yet. The
prehistoric remains at 41BT178 and 41BT179 were assessed as not eligible for formal SAL designation.
With its buried remains and impressive stonework, the Shaffer-Hood Farmstead (41BT177) represents a
site that has both research and interpretive potential. The historic component is rated as potentially
eligible for SAL designation. The historic component at site 41BT67 is assessed as not eligible for formal
designation an SAL.
Site 41BT361 contains debitage scattered over an 8-acre area from the surface down to 1.5 meters;
however, because no discrete cultural zones or features could be identified during the excavation of 14
shovel tests and a backhoe trench, the site is not considered eligible for SAL designation. Because sites
41BT428 and 41BT451 needed backhoe trenching and more intensive shovel testing, these two sites were
placed in the category of sites potentially eligible for SAL designation at that time.
A 20-acre brush clearing project in 2011 revealed the third floodplain site, 41BT451, which probably
represents a prehistoric campsite, and resulted in the enlargement of prehistoric campsite 41BT70 (Malof
et al. 2012).
Later, in 2013, a cultural resources survey was conducted as a part of a dead tree removal project in the
Camp Creek and Shaffer Bend resource areas (Hixson, 2014). LCRA staff did uncover two additional
archaeological sites, 41BT482 and 41BT483, during the Shaffer Bend survey.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Prehistoric Background
Over 50 years of archaeological investigations in Central Texas have led to a general understanding of the
regionâs chronology and prehistoric subsistence patterns (Collins 1995). Much of the regionâs chronology
was derived from excavations of deeply stratified terrace sites similar to those found across the river at
the mouth of Double Horn Creek. From at least 11,500 years ago up until the Spanish period (circa AD
1700), the Edwards Plateau and the much of the rest of Central Texas were inhabited solely by huntergatherers. Even in the Late Prehistoric period (AD 700 â 1650) when native groups in other parts of what
is now Texas were making the transition to an agriculture-based economy, the Central Texas groups
continued to rely completely on wild resources. Much of the archaeological record relates to subsistence
activities, the presence of burned rocks from cooking facilities being a notable example. At certain
locations, burned rock fragments have accumulated to the point of forming low topographic features
known as burned rock middens, or locally as âIndian mounds.â
Texas has traditionally been divided into a number of different archaeological regions, each defined by a
set of shared cultural traits, such as projectile point forms. Many archaeologists today interpret huntergatherer cultures in terms of their adaptation to the natural environment, and one criticism of
archaeological regions is that they often encompass more than one environmental zone and so contain
more than one type of adaptation (Ellis et al. 1995). For example, the Central Texas Archeological Region
includes six natural regions, including the Edwards Plateau where the Shaffer Bend Recreation Area is
located.
One cultural trait that is characteristic of the Edwards Plateau, especially the eastern portion, is the
immense size of burned rock middens, some covering several acres. Burned rock middens are found in
other natural regions of the state but the large size of those on the Plateau is unique and suggests a level of
intensity and duration not seen elsewhere.
Historic Background
Settlement of the Shaffer Bend of the Colorado River by people of Old World descent began with Noah
Smithwick, who built a frame in the area in the mid-1850s. Smithwick constructed a mill in the winter of
1857-58 only 0.5 miles downstream from the parkâs eastern property line. Although no homes appear to
have been built before 1900 within the area now encompassed by the park, the extensive floodplain
within the meander of the river was probably cleared and tilled at an early date, conceivably by
Smithwick, who owned much of what is now the western half of the park. He even mentions in memoirs
of opening up 100 acres of bottomland (Smithwick 1983).
Two farmsteads were built within what is now the park sometime in the early twentieth century. One of
these is the Shaffer-Hood Farmstead (41BT177) built on the edge of the high Pleistocene terrace in the
upland margin zone overlooking the floodplain. This location afforded easy access to the agricultural
fields but was high enough to escape most floods from the river. The site was referred to as the Abe Hood
Farmstead by local informants whose oral histories were recorded in the 1990s (Utley 1994). Hugh
292

Abraham âAbeâ Hood bought the property two years before his death in 1924, but the farmstead was built
by a previous landowner, perhaps E. L. and Theresa Kusenberger, who held the property between 1903
and 1906, or J. H. Shaffer, who was the owner from 1903 until 1922 when it was sold to Hood. Since the
building is depicted on the USGS Topographic map with cultural features in existence in 1909, the house
was most likely built between 1903 and 1909. Shovel testing near the house foundations recovered cut
nailsâa type of nail superseded by the wire nail by 1900âso it is possible the house was constructed in
the late 1800s when large chimneys were more common on rural homes.
The Shaffer family reacquired the farmstead sometime after 1924 and eventually sold it LCRA. The
house was occupied up until the time LCRA took over ownership, but LCRA officials considered it
barely livable. No obvious trace of the house structure remains today although most of the massive stone
chimney is still standing, as well as an enormous stone cistern. The cistern is a bell-shaped underground
reservoir 20 feet deep and built of stone with a circular collar rising 2.5 feet above the ground surface. It
is connected to the house by a stone-lined drain with a filtration system that received rainwater from the
gabled roof. Utley (1994) notes the high degree of craftsmanship involved in the construction of the
fireplace and cistern and suggests that Primus Lewis, a locally-renowned stone mason and former slave,
was responsible for the work.
The second historic house site, Meredith Farmstead, is located in an area where the terrace is not quite so
prominent but still rises noticeably above the floodplain. This farmstead included a house, a log barn, a
log crib, and a concrete dipping vat. The farmhouse lacks the stonework seen at the Shaffer-Hood
Farmstead and appears to be of early twentieth century construction. Utley (1994) describes its
architecture as displaying both Victorian and bungalow features, which he notes is a transitional style
common on farm houses in the early 1900s. Only wire nails were used in its construction, again
suggesting a twentieth century date for the house. Two structures are depicted in the area on the (1909
cultural) USGS topographic map although these buildings could be the barn and crib, which would mean
the house was built later.
The farmstead is named after J. A. and Elizabeth Meredith, who were the owners from 1925 until it was
sold to LCRA in 1939. The Merediths acquired the property from heirs of Abe Hood, whose family had
owned the property since 1888. The house and two out buildings (barn and crib) were probably built late
in the tenure of the Hood family.
The only standing structure at 41BT67 besides the concrete dipping vat is the log crib, although it has
recently begun to collapse. The log barn was dismantled in the 1980s or early 1990s and taken to the
Jordan-Bachman Pioneer Farm in Austin, where it was reconstructed as a dog-run style house. The
farmhouse has now completely collapsed on top of its stone piers. Utley notes that it was built with
balloon framing and covered with board-and-batten siding.

METHODOLOGY
The project was designed to identify and assess archaeological sites that might be eligible for formal
listing as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL). All work was conducted under blanket TAC Permit 7531
293

and terms of the memorandum of understanding between THC and LCRA, which incorporates CTA
survey and reporting standards.
The shovel test program was executed following THC standards, with at least 1 shovel test placed per 2
acres. Shovel tests were excavated in 20-centimeter [cm] levels to pre-Holocene levels or a depth of 120
cm, whichever was reached first. Soils were screened through 1/4-inch mesh unless dominated by clay, in
which case they were sorted by hand. Within drainages, exposed cutbanks were examined in lieu of
shovel testing. Artifacts were recorded and photographed, but were not collected; these were reinterred
within the shovel test following completion.

RESULTS
LCRA archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of 100 percent of the
proposed project area on September 8, 12, and 14, 2016. In total, 20 shovel tests were excavated within
the boundaries of the proposed recreational area, and four were placed along the length of the proposed
water pipeline right-of-way (Figure 143). The investigations also referenced five shovel tests excavated
during prior surveys (Hixson, 2014); two were located along the project areaâs southern margin and three
were excavated during the original documentation of site 41BT483. The total of 24 new shovel tests
exceeds the THCâs minimum survey standards. The northern 375 linear m of the water pipeline right of
way were not subjected to shovel testing due to slopes greater than 20 percent, a lack of soil deposition,
and high surface visibility. A possible chert core and primary flake were noted on the slope forming site
41BT68âs northern margin in disturbed contexts, but no cultural resources were observed north of that
point Two previously recorded archaeological sites, 41BT68 and 41BT483, were revisited.
41BT68
LCRA archaeologists revisited site 41BT68, a prehistoric scatter of lithic debris and burned rock, which
was originally recorded in 1979 (Prewitt and Cotter 1980). It extends across a low terrace at an elevation
of 700 ft amsl and continues up a low ridge to the north to a maximum elevation of approximately 290 ft
amsl. The site begins north of a seasonal drainage and is bisected by a smaller intermittent drainage near
its center. Although not visible on USGS topographic maps, field observation noted that the two are
connected by a roughly north-south drainage running parallel to a modern fence line. This drainage has

294

.

Heavily dissected all but roughly 5 m of the ground surface east towards the fence (Figure 144). The soils
within the site area are mapped as belonging to the Hensley association, undulating. At the time of survey,
295

ground surface visibility was less than 30 percent due to the presence of low grasses and leaf cover from
scattered hardwoods.

Figure 144. Site 41BT68, facing south. Fence line is at left, and a drainage is at right.

The original recorders of the site noted scattered lithic debris within the plowed field to the east of the
fence line, but the site form does not detail any subsurface artifacts or features below the plow zone
(Atlas). During the current project, LCRA archaeologists placed only two shovel tests within the
boundaries of site 41BT68 due to the heavy disturbance of the drainage to the west and the narrow width
of intact soils east to the fence line. Extremely compact soils and dense roots precluded shovel testing
below 50 cm below ground surface; both tests proved negative for cultural materials. The cutbanks of the
drainage were also examined, but no artifacts or features were observed in the profiles.
The only observed artifacts within the site boundaries within the right-of-way were a possible chert core
and a single primary flake. These were observed on the surface of the slope at the northern margin of the
site. Soils within that portion of the site belong to the Hensley soil series, which consists of very shallow
loams over basal clays at a depth of approximately 10 cm.

296

The current survey found only surface evidence of site 41BT68 within the project right-of-way in areas
with no soil deposition. No traces of artifacts or features were encountered in the lower portion of the site,
either on the surface or within the nearby cutbanks. As a result, LCRA Cultural Resources staff
recommends that site 41BT68 be considered ineligible for formal SAL status within the pipeline right-ofway. Any portions of the site that may extend beyond the right-of-way were not investigated, and are
recommended as being of undetermined SAL status.
41BT483
Prehistoric site 41BT483 was identified in 2013 (Atlas) and revisited during the current survey. At an
elevation of 710 ft amsl, the site occupies a gently sloping terrace above a deeply incised drainage
immediately to the east. An existing pedestrian trail runs along the eastern edge of the site, and the
difference in elevation to the west suggests the path may have been graded during vegetation clearance.
The local soils are mapped as belonging to the Weswood series of silty loams (Dittemore and Allison
1979). Various hardwoods form the dominant vegetation, and low grasses within the understory greatly
limited ground surface visibility at the time fieldwork was performed.
The initial investigation of site 41BT483 entailed surface observation and the excavation of three shovel
tests (Atlas). Lithic debitage and a few burned rocks were found in exposed areas on the ground surface.
All three shovel tests were positive for cultural materials, with materials comprising chert flakes, mussel
shell, and burned rock fragments (Figure 145). Two shovel tests yielded a single flake and a mussel shell
each, and the third produced 5 flakes and flake fragments. All were found within the upper 40 cm of soils,
though deeper excavation was precluded by the density of tree roots. No SAL eligibility was determined,
and deeper testing was recommended due to the presence of roots (Atlas).
During the current survey, nine shovel tests were placed to further define the siteâs horizontal and vertical
extent, with four producing cultural materials. These positive tests expanded the site boundaries roughly
25 m to the south and 10 m to the north of its originally recorded limits. The site is bounded to the north
and south by shovel testing, on the east by a drainage, and to the west by the project limit. As currently
defined, site 41BT483 measures approximately 100 m from northwest to southeast and 75 m from
southwest to northeast, with a surface area of roughly 1.5 acres.
In general, shovel tests encountered sandy or silty loams extending to depths of over 120 cm below
surface, consistent with the description of the Weswood series of soils (Dittemore and Allison 1979).
Each of the four positive tests encountered a single chert flake at depths between 20 and 80 cm, and one
yielded a distal biface fragment near the terminal depth of the test (Figure 4). Fragments of mussel shell
were found within two of the positive shovel tests, and small pieces of possibly burned rock were present
in two tests as well. Artifacts were noted and reinterred upon test completion.

The current program of shovel testing at site 41BT483 produced only a sparse prehistoric artifact
assemblage within four positive shovel tests placed across the site. The tests were excavated to depths of
over 1 m, with all but one artifact appearing below 80 cm below ground surface; these ranged in depth
between 20 and 80 cm, with no apparent vertical stratigraphic integrity. While fragments of burned rock
and mussel shell were present within some of the tests, there was no evidence of any intact cultural
features either within the tests or on the ground surface. For these reasons, LCRA Cultural Resources staff
recommends that site 41BT483 be considered ineligible for formal SAL status within the project area.
Potential portions of the site extending west of the project boundary were not investigated, and are
recommended as being of undetermined SAL status.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
LCRA Cultural Resources staff conducted an intensive archaeological assessment of a 22-acre plot and a
contiguous 1 km water pipeline right-of-way within the Shaffer Bend Recreation Area. Two previously

298

recorded sites, 41BT68 and 41BT483, were relocated. The portions of both sites within the project area
and right-of-way are recommended not eligible for listing on the SAL.
As planned, the majority of the improvements will not extend below 0.9 m in depth and should not
disturb the possible buried A-horizons typical of the Weswood soil series. A proposed restroom facility is
anticipated to have deeper impacts, although the exact location has not yet been determined. Once its
position is established, LCRA recommends testing and/or monitoring within that area. With that
exception, LCRA Cultural Resources staff considers the proposed recreation area and pipeline right-ofway to be fully investigated. Because no SAL-eligible sites will be impacted by the majority of the project
area, LCRA staff recommends that all currently proposed workâwith the exception of the proposed
restroom facilitiesâbe allowed to proceed without restrictions.
Standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place, and should any previously undiscovered
cultural resources be discovered in the course of the rebuild, work in the immediate vicinity of the
discovery will cease, and LCRA Cultural Resources staff will be contacted to determine what, if any,
mitigation efforts are necessary.

Transmission Line Overhaul Project from Luling to Harwood, Caldwell and Gonzales Counties,
Texas

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing an overhaul of a segment of its existing T-542
Cuero to Luling transmission line. This segment composes the northern section of the T-542 line, running
from the Luling substation in Caldwell County to Structure 379 in the vicinity of the Harwood Substation
in Gonzales County, Texas (Figure 146-Figure 148). The transmission line is approximately 9.7 miles
(15.6 kilometers [km]) in length and occupies a 100-foot (ft) (30 meter [m]) -wide easement, totaling
almost 120 acres. The project will consist of the removal of existing support structures and their
replacement with 79 proposed structures. The new structures will be in placed in new locations, and a 30to 36-inch auger will be employed to drill the new holes to depths of over 6 ft. Other impacts may involve
the modification of the banks of intermittent streams to improve existing vehicle crossings.
This segment of the T-542 transmission line has not been subjected to prior archeological investigations,
so a cultural resources assessment was necessary. The assessment consisted of a map and file review
followed by an intensive cultural resources survey of high probability areas (HPA), both prehistoric and
historic, that could be impacted by construction activities. Over 50 percent of the project areaâ5.2 linear
miles (8.4 km) of 100-ft-wide right of way, totaling 63 acresâwas identified as HPA.
Forty proposed tower locations are located within these HPAs, and were examined by LCRA Cultural
Resources staff on three occasions in November and December, 2016, using standard survey and
subsurface testing methods. In areas where deep alluvial soils were mapped, a skid steer equipped with a
40-cm-diameter auger was used to reach greater depths through clays. The Texas Historical
Commissionâs minimum state survey standards for linear surveys were not met due to the paucity of soils,
high surface visibility, and the targeting of specific proposed structure locations to be subjected to
subsurface disturbances. One new site, 41GZ252, a prehistoric lithic scatter, was recorded during the
survey; the portion of the site within the current right of way does not appear to be eligible for designation
as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
The cultural resource investigations were conducted under the terms of LCRAâs annual blanket State
Antiquities Permit 7531 in accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and the Memorandum of
Understanding between the Texas Historical Commission and LCRA. There is no known or anticipated
federal funding or permitting involved with this project. No artifacts were collected during the survey; all
field records will be submitted to an an accredited curation facility.

Environmental background
The project area is located in southern Caldwell and northern Gonzales counties between the towns of
Luling and Harwood, Texas. It lies at the junction of the Blackland Prairie Area to the northwest and the
Claypan Area to the southeast, moving from undulating prairies to gently undulating and rolling
topography, which is moderately dissected (Alvarez 2016:90). Originally, the Blackland Prairie was
mainly a grassy plain; today, much of it has been turned into grassy pastureland, with various hardwood

timbers occupying the bottomlands. Within the Claypan Area, or Post Oak Savannah, hardwoods
dominated the original vegetation, along with a variety of grasses (Inglis 1964; Alvarez 2016:113).
Geologically, the project area is underlain primarily by Eocene-age formations that developed in the
Tertiary period. From west to east, these formations are the Wilcox Group, Carrizo Sand, and the Reklaw
Formation (Barnes 1974). The Wilcox Group is composed mostly of mudstone, with quantities of
sandstone, lignite, and ironstone concretions also present. Carrizo Sand is characterized by medium to
very coarse grained sandstone, which is friable and thick-bedded. The Reklaw Formation comprises thinto massively-bedded sandstone and clay ranging in thickness from 50 to 80 feet. Additionally, there are
small areas of recent alluvium, which have accumulated in the floodplains of the Salt Branch and the
confluence of Plum and McNeil creeks.
The upland topography is frequently dissected by narrow drainages and swales, the majority of which
hold water only intermittently and seasonally. Among the larger drainages of the area, from west to east,
are the Salt Branch, Plum Creek, McNeil Creek, and Mule Creek. These water sources all feed into the
San Marcos River to the south, which in turn flows into the Guadalupe River Basin and on to the Gulf of
Mexico.
The T-542 transmission line crosses numerous mapped soil types (Table 18) (Lowther and Werchan
1978; United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service [USDA, NRCS]
2006). With few exceptions, the upland soils tend toward sands and sandy loams. These range from
shallow to very deep, frequently containing pebbles and cobbles of chert or sandstone, the latter of which
is dark red and abundant in this area (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016). The floodplain soils within the
project area have the ability to possess buried A-horizons, and are typically considered to have a medium
to very high probability for harboring buried cultural resources (Abbott 2013).

The T-542 transmission line, previously numbered T-543, was originally constructed around 1959, and
the 100-ft-wide right of way has since been modified and cleared of major vegetation. Visible impacts to
the project area are predominantly the clearance of land for providing pasturage and the original
construction and ongoing maintenance activities along the transmission line corridor. The majority of the
right of way appears to have been subjected to periodic maintenance, although small portions are
overgrown with thick grasses and shrubs.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to this survey, Caldwell and Gonzales counties had 170 and 251 recorded archaeological sites,
respectively (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas [Atlas]), which can safely be described as encompassing all
presently recognized cultural periods. No prior cultural resources projects have been conducted within the
immediate vicinity of the transmission line, which was constructed around 1959. Only five previous
projects lie within 1 km (0.6 miles) of project area.
LCRAâs T-173 transmission line, south from Harwood to Gonzales, was surveyed by the Texas
Archeological Survey in 1981 (Kenmotsu 1981). Intersecting the eastern terminus of the current project
area in Harwood, T-173 parallels T-542 south from Harwood to Gonzales. The 1981 survey was located
completely within Gonzales County and recorded five prehistoric sites. These sites (41GZ175â179)
consisted of highly dispersed scatters of chert cores and reduction debris, with one, 41GZ175, producing
some fragments of burned rock. While sites 41GZ176 and 41GZ179 have been designated of

313

undetermined eligibility and ineligible for SAL status, respectively, no formal determinations for the
other sites are listed in the THCâs Atlas.
In 2005, LCRA surveyed the northern extent of the T-173 transmission line, which lies north of and
roughly parallels T-542 from Luling to Harwood (Hixson et al. 2006). This survey identified three
previously unrecorded cultural resource sites, 41CW98â100. Sites 41CW98 and 41CW99 represent
primarily surface scatters of chert debitage and burned rock, and were determined ineligible for
designation as SALs. Site 41GZ100 possessed a prehistoric component represented by chert
manufacturing debris and a Scallorn point, and a historic component comprised of scattered domestic
debris and a sandstone well; this site was determined to be of undetermined eligibility (Table 19).
LCRA also conducted a survey of the T-538 transmission line from Deer Creek to Luling in 2016 (Larsen
and Prikryl 2016). This project crossed a small section of previously known 41CW28 (discussed below)
and identified seven new archeological sites (41GU183â188, and 41CW170), none of which were found
eligible for designation as SALs. Only site 41CW170, a possible homestead dating to the early to midtwentieth century, is located within the vicinity of the current T-542 survey area. The portion of the site
within the transmission line right-of-way, consisting of three standing structures, two concrete slabs, and
a cistern within, has been found to be ineligible for SAL designation.
The remaining two projects were performed in association with stabilization efforts on the San Marcos
River at Zedlerâs Mill (41CW28) just south of Luling (Quigg and Meyers 2003; Burden 2013). These
focused on the SAL-eligible 1874 gristmill and dam-related structures from the early to mid-twentieth
century.
A review of the Atlas indicates that there are no previously recorded archeological sites, SALs, NRHPeligible sites, or other known cultural resources within the area to be affected by the proposed
construction along this section of T-542. In total, five cultural resources sites and four cemeteries are
located within 0.6 miles of the project area (see Table 18). Of those not discussed above, prehistoric site
41CW8 was recorded in 1971 and described as a âlarge camp.â Details within the site form are few, but
observed materials included lithic debitage, a Pedernales projectile point, and a possible Darl or
Yarbrough point (Atlas). None of the sites identified within 1 km prior to the T-542 survey will be
impacted by the current project.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Prehistoric Background
The project area spans the southeastern margin of the Central Texas archeological region (as summarized
by Perttula 2013), and the northeastern margin of the South Texas Archeological Region (as defined by
Hester 1995). Ellis et al. (1995) note the inaccurate homogenization that occurs when writing about
ecologically diverse regions such as these. Indeed, at various times the Central and South Texas
archaeological regions share diagnostic artifacts with their neighboring regions. A framework based on
research in both regions comprises the basic chronological divisions of Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Protohistoric. A more detailed account of the regional prehistory will be included in the
final version of this report.
Historic Background
The history of the area through which LCRAâs T-542 electrical transmission line runs, goes back to the
beginnings of major Texas settlement in the early to mid-nineteenth century. The area was at the center of
the Texas Revolution in 1836 but faded in prominence during the latter half of the century. In the
twentieth century oil played a significant role in the area. The majority of the following discussion is
summarized from the descriptions of Gonzales and Caldwell counties in The Handbook of Texas Online.
Gonzales County
The area of todayâs Gonzales County was originally a part of a Mexican land grant to Green C. DeWitt in
1825 (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016). The town of Gonzales, the first Anglo settlement west of the
Colorado River, was established at the confluence of the San Marcos and Guadalupe rivers as the capital
DeWittâs Colony (Roell 2016). Following attacks by Native Americans and a brief unsanctioned
resettlement near the mouth of the Lavaca River, a number of settlers returned to the site of Gonzales in
1827. The colony grew quickly and attracted over 100 families within a few years. Subsequently, in 1831
the Mexican government provided the population of over 500 with a six-pound cannon to protect against
Native American raids. After delegates from the colony were sent to the Consultation of 1835, a gathering
of Texan representatives, the Mexican government sent troops to take back the cannon at Gonzales. The
first armed encounter of the Texas Revolution was sparked by the colonistsâ resistance (Baumgartner and
Vollentine 2016). Following the battle at the Alamo, Sam Houstonâs troops retreated to the Colorado
River, burning the town of Gonzales during their flight, which became known as the Runaway Scape.
One of the Republic of Texasâ original counties, Gonzales County was established in 1836 occupying the
same area of DeWittâs Colony (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016). Returning settlers obtained land
grants, and their farms and ranches produced cotton and corn as the countyâs principal commodities. After
Texas was annexed by the United States, Gonzales County was split to form eight additional counties.
From 1850 to 1860, the countyâs population swelled from 1,492 (including 601 slaves), to 8,059
(including 3,158 slaves). During this time, the cattle industry was one of the countyâs primary economic
mainstays, along with corn and cotton.

315

In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the population grew steadily, peaking at over 28,000 by 1900.
The cattle industry increased dramatically, and agriculture continued to be dominated by cotton and corn.
The arrival of the railroads significantly increased growth, leading to the formation of towns such as
Harwood, which was founded in 1874 and quickly became a center for rail shipping (Townsend 2016).
Eventually, the overdependence on cotton as a cash crop led to a rise in tenant farming, from 40 percent
in 1890 to over 66 percent by the 1930s (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016). With the Great Depression
the population of the county declined sharply in the 1940s and then steadily throughout the next few
decades. Although it has recovered somewhat, its current population of approximately 20,000 people is
far below its earliest peak.
Caldwell County
Caldwell County was originally part of DeWittâs Colony, later Gonzales County, as discussed above.
Located over 15 miles northwest of the town of Gonzales, settlement in this area began slightly later, with
the majority of land grants made during the early to mid-1830s (Smyrl 2016a). Following the Runway
Scape and the defeat of Native American raiders at Plum Creek in 1840, settlement of the area increased
quickly. By 1847, the growing population petitioned the United States government for the establishment
of a new county, which was granted a year later. The town of Lockhart became the county seat of the new
Caldwell County.
The economic and social history of Caldwell County so closely resembles that of its parent, Gonzales
County, that it will not be discussed here in much further depth. The cattle industry dominated the local
economy until the turn of the century, when cotton displaced it as the leading commodity. The railroads
were similarly a great driving force in the countyâs economic growth and population increase. Although
settlement had already begun along Plum Creek in the 1840s, it was not until 1874 that the town of Luling
formed around the terminus of the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railroad (Smyrl 2016b).
The discovery of oil in 1922 resulted in a new industry that changed the countyâs economy to one that
was no longer almost completely cotton-dependent. While the new resource helped to somewhat cushion
the effects of the Great Depression, the countyâs economy was still hard hit, and the population declined
by nearly half to 17,222 by 1960; it has since rebounded, reaching almost 40,000 in 2014 (Smyrl 2016a).

METHODOLOGY
The project was designed to identify and assess archaeological sites that might be eligible for formal
listing as SALs. All work was conducted under blanket TAC Permit 7531 and terms of the memorandum
of understanding between THC and LCRA, which incorporates CTA survey and reporting standards.
Following a review of geology, soils, recent and historical maps, and previous investigations, 5.2 linear
miles (8.4 km) of HPA were identified for potential prehistoric and historic sites. Prehistoric HPAs were
based on proximity to natural water resources and topography, and historic HPAs were based on aerial
photographs and historic map research. HPAs were covered by pedestrian survey, with subsurface testing
conducted within 3 m of the proposed tower locations within those areas.

316

Shovel tests were excavated in 20-centimeter (cm) levels to subsoil or a depth of 120 cmbs (cm below
surface), whichever was reached first. Soils were screened through 0.25-inch mesh unless dominated by
clay, in which case they were sorted by hand. Artifacts were recorded, but were not collected; instead,
artifacts were reinterred within the shovel test following completion.
Additionally, in areas with deep alluvium and high potential for buried deposits, LCRA Cultural
Resources staff used a skid-steer-mounted auger to excavate subsurface tests 40 cm in diameter, in 20-cm
levels and to a depth of 120 cm to 140 cmbs. Auger tests were placed near proposed new structure
locations. As with the shovel tests, all deposits were screened in the field using 0.25-inch mesh screens.
No materials were collected during this survey.

RESULTS
Portions of the T-542 transmission line possessing a high probability for encountering cultural resources
sites were surveyed by LCRA archaeologists on November 30 to December 1, December 9, and
December 15, 2016. Six areas of prehistoric HPA and two areas of historic HPA were identified prior to
the beginning of fieldwork. These HPAs were subjected to surface observation, and the proposed
transmission line structure locations within them were given particular focus, supplemented with shovel
testing. Of the original 40 proposed structure locations situated within HPAs, six were ruled out for
examination in the field based on slope, lack of soils, or previous disturbances. Shovel tests were not
conducted where stream cutbanks provided clear profile views of the soil profiles, or where ground
disturbance was significant. The skid steer and auger were used where Holocene soils appeared too deep
or clayey to excavate by hand. In total, 37 shovel tests were excavated, of which 3 were positive for
cultural materials. Two of these were located on a newly recorded prehistoric archaeological site,
41GZ252, and the last proved to be an isolated find. Six tests were excavated within alluvial settings with
the skid steer, all of which proved negative for cultural materials. No features or associated artifacts were
found within the areas identified as historic HPAs.
41GZ252
Setting and Description
Site 41GZ252 is a newly recorded prehistoric site located within an open pasture on a low upland rise
overlooking Mule Creek, which lies immediately to the east (Figure 149). Situated on a level to gently
sloping landform, the site spans an elevation of roughly 380 to 390 feet above mean sea level. Soils across
the site are mapped as belonging to the Silstid series of fine sands (USDA, NRCS 2006), whereas
Waelder soils, frequently flooded, occupy the creek basin. Vegetation within the existing transmission
line right of way consists of low, cut grasses; mixed hardwoods and Ashe junipers occupy the areas
beyond the cleared right of way and line the banks of Mule Creek.
While the ground cover afforded low surface visibility, ubiquitous gopher holes were present within the
area; these provided high visibility within mounds of previously subsurface soils displaced by

317

bioturbation. Modern disturbances to the site consist of the clearance of vegetation for grazing, as well as
the construction of the transmission line and a two-track road along the siteâs eastern margin.

Figure 149. Overview of site 41GZ252 towards Mule Creek, facing east.

Work Performed
The site was initially located by surface observation and examination of the bioturbated soils, which
exposed a light scatter of lithic materials within the right of way (Figure 150). Archeologists performed a
general walkover of the site area in order to identify the extent and nature of surface finds. Artifacts
within redeposited soils were observed across the entire width of the right of way from the creek to the
vicinity of an existing transmission structure, roughly 75 m to the west.
In order to test soil depth and determine the horizontal and vertical extent of the site, four shovel tests
were placed within the right of way. Two shovel tests were placed in areas with a high density of surface
materials or advantageous topography. These yielded chert artifacts primarily between 20 and 60 cm
below ground surface. Soils consisted of fine sands to depths of 90 and 100 cm, with gravels increasing
with depth. The remaining two shovel tests were excavated at the proposed structure location and 15 m to
the west. Both tests proved negative for cultural materials, thus defining the western margin of site
41GZ252. The encountered soils were fine sands and sandy loams overlying sandy clay at a depth of
approximately 55 cm.
Based on surface observation, shovel testing, and existing limits (i.e., transmission right of way and Mule
Creek), the siteâs extent was determined to be approximately 75 m east-west by 30 m north-south. It is

318

likely that the site continues to the north and south beyond the LCRA right of way, but these areas were
not examined.

Artifact Analysis
All of the artifacts recorded at site 41GZ252 were observed either within soils displaced by gopher
activity or within shovel tests. Vegetation at the time of survey precluded the ability to determine whether
any undisturbed surface manifestation is present. Artifacts noted within the rodent burrows included a
thin biface fragment, 4 secondary flakes, 7 tertiary flakes, and a possible fragment of burned limestone.
The biface fragment was snapped across the middle, and measured roughly 3 cm in length, 4 cm in width,
and 1 cm in thickness; there were no clear indications of a diagnostic type.
Shovel Test 27 produced 3 tertiary flakes and flake fragments, a core fragment (5 cm in diameter), and 4
pieces of chert shatter. With the exception of a flake in Level 1, all artifacts were found within Levels 2
and 3, ranging from 20 to 60 cm in depth. Similarly, Shovel Test 28 yielded three tertiary flakes and 1
piece of burned chert shatter in Levels 2 and 3. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed, and no
artifacts were collected.
Conclusions and Recommendation
Site 41GZ252 appears to represent a prehistoric open campsite of indeterminate age and cultural
association. The sparse lithic assemblage lies within sandy soils that have obviously been impacted by
319

bioturbation, likely precluding stratigraphic integrity. The siteâs lack of features and diagnostic artifacts
likewise suggest that the site does not have the capacity to yield meaningful information to the study of
Texas prehistory. As a result, LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends that the portion of site
41GZ252 within the transmission line right of way be considered ineligible for formal SAL status. Any
portions of the site that may extend beyond the right of way were not investigated, and are recommended
as being of undetermined SAL status.
Isolated Finds (IF)
Small numbers of chert debitage were found at two loci within the project area. Because of the sparsity of
materials, these were considered to be isolated finds rather than intact archeological sites.
IF 1
IF 1 is situated on a low toeslope roughly 220 m west of site 41GZ252, overlooking an unnamed
drainage. Three flakes were observed on the surface within soils displaced by rodent burrows over a
distance of roughly 100 m; thorough surface examination noted no other artifacts or features. Two shovel
tests were excavated in undisturbed locations; these encountered sandy loams to a maximum of 65 cmbs,
but yielded no cultural material.
IF 2
IF 2 was located on a low rise above the floodplain between bends of the Salt Branch. One positive shovel
test produced a single tertiary flake at a depth of between 60 and 80 cmbs, as well as several small chunks
of chert of questionable manufacture. Four additional shovel tests were placed on either side of the
positive test to the east and west along the 100-ft-wide right of way. All of these proved negative for
cultural materials. A single chert tertiary flake was observed on the surface, located within backdirt from
a gopher hole; despite the high ground surface visibility and a thorough walkover, no other artifacts or
features were detected.

SUMMARY
LCRA Cultural Resources staff conducted an intensive cultural resources assessment of 5.2 linear miles
(8.4 km) of HPA in preparation for the proposed overhaul of transmission line T-542 between the Luling
substation and Structure 379 in the vicinity of Harwood Substation. The project operated within a 100-ftwide right of way and covered an area of approximately 63 acres. The assessment located and recorded
one previously undocumented cultural resource site. Site 41GZ252 is a prehistoric site represented by a
light surface and subsurface scatter of lithic tool production debris. Due to the paucity of artifacts, the
poor preservation of site integrity, and the lack of temporally diagnostic indicators, the portion of site
41GZ252 within the current right of way does not appear to meet the criteria for designation as an SAL.
LCRA Cultural Resources staff considers the overhaul of this T-542 transmission line segment between
Luling and Harwood to be fully investigated. Because no SAL-eligible sites will be impacted by
construction activities staff recommends that all currently proposed work be allowed to proceed without
320

restrictions. Standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place, and should any previously
undiscovered cultural resources be discovered in the course of the rebuild, work in the immediate vicinity
of the discovery will cease, and LCRA Cultural Resources staff will be contacted to determine what, if
any, mitigation efforts are necessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Lower Colorado River Authority is proposing to replace 39 transmission line structures along its T198 electrical transmission line, which spans 13.8 miles in between the cities of Yoakum and Cuero in
Dewitt County, Texas (Figure 151-Figure 154). The structures are currently H-frames with wooden poles,
and the 39 selected structures will be replaced with new structures of identical construction within 10 feet
of their current locations.
The T-198 right of way corridor has never been surveyed for cultural resources, having only been
subjected to right of way maintenance in recent years. Since new ground disturbance will be generated by
the removal and replacement of structures, an intensive cultural resources survey of the affected structure
locations was conducted from November 8th to November 18th, 2016. While modification of stream
crossings is not currently planned, several major crossings were examined to determine their condition, as
well as assess the potential presence of cultural resources.
Approximately 11.15 miles of the T-198 transmission line was driven, and given a basic assessment via
windshield survey. This would account for a total of 137 acres out of 167 acres of right of way easement.
An estimated 2,049 meters, or 1.27 miles, of pedestrian survey was conducted, totaling 14.8 acres.
There were no previously recorded sites within the T-198 right of way, and no new archaeological sites
were recorded in the course of this survey.
No artifacts were collected during the project; project records will be submitted to an accredited curation
facility.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located in the northern corner of DeWitt County, just west of the city of Cuero and
extending into Yoakum. It is within a section of Southern Blackland Prairie that dissects Southern Post
Oak Savanna. (Griffith et. al 2007). The Fayette Prairie intersects the much larger Northern Blackland,
and is distinguished by differing geology, soil and land use (Griffith et. al 2007:64). For example, the
Houston Black soils (Vertisols) that are commonly found in the northern prairie are largely absent in the
Fayette Prairie, and Mollisols are common. The present project crosses Mollisols, primarily in stream
valleys, and Alfisols (soils with little time for development) in the uplands. Soils are about equally split
between clay or sandy clay loam (Cuero, Silvern-Ellen, Meguin, Denhawken-Elmendorf , Trinity, and
Degola series soils) and fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand (Crockett, Catilla, Straber and Tremona
series) (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Table 20 lists the various soils and their basic characteristics.
T-198 stretches across the Guadalupe and Lavaca River basins and crosses three major streams from the
south to the north, Irish Creek, Willow Prong, and Little Bushy Creek. Vegetation in the area is a
complex mix between wooded areas and pastures which include native grasses with scattered clumps of
trees. Post oak trees dominated, but other species included blackjack oak, water oak, winged elm,
hackberry, and yaupon are present.

Controlled fires as well as other factors such as drought, herbivory, and competition from grasses
restricted shrub and tree growth and maintained the savannah. Since the early 1800s, the suppression of
fire, and soil disturbance and land clearing practices by farmers and ranchers have resulted in a higher
density of smaller trees and thicker undergrowth of vegetation, especially yaupon (Texas Parks and
Wildlife, 2016)

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
At the time of this survey, there were 336 archaeological sites recorded in Dewitt County. LCRA recently
conducted two surveys in the vicinity of the T-198 transmission line. Project 24.14, which surveyed the
T-541 transmission line from the Lost Creek substation to the Cuero Hydro substation, and Project 28.14,
which surveyed the Cuero Hydro substation to the Hochheim Tap. The T-541 Survey revisited one site,
and recorded five new sites, none of which were eligible for SAL listing within the right of way. The T541 transmission line runs for 6 miles in a generally north to south direction, and is just under 1 mile from
the city of Cuero. The survey of T-543 revisited three sites, and recorded three new sites, all of which
were recommended as ineligible within the right of way. The T-543 transmission line (now a portion of
the larger T-542 transmission line) runs for approximately 11 miles from the Cuero Hydro substation, two
miles northwest of Cuero, to the Hochheim substation, in a generally north-northwest direction.
335

A review of LCRAâs internal cultural resources files, as well as the THCâs online Archeological Site
Atlas, revealed that no cultural resources surveys had been conducted on the T-198 right of way. In fact,
the area through which the transmission line runs is relatively void of recorded archaeological sites, there
only being two within 2 km of the right of way. Site 41DW268, which lies 90 m east of the LCRA right
of way, just north of where it crosses the portion of the Southern Pacific Railroad adjacent to Big Brushy
Creek, is a historic foundation complex that appears to be related to the railroad. The site form makes no
suggestion of the SAL eligibility of the site. The other site, 41DW246, is a historic cabin known as the
May-Hickey House, or the May/McBride Cabin, and is a National Register property. The site is mapped
1.9 km from the T-198 right of way.
Despite the lack of recorded sites in the immediate vicinity of the T-198 line, the southern 3.45 miles of
the right of way runs through the Cuero I National Register District (Figure 155). The Cuero I National
Register District is approximately 57,000 acres, and extends from Cuero in the south to Gonzales in the
north (Figure 155). The district was created in 1974 in response to a proposed reservoir project that was
never completed (Fox et al. 1974). It contains 358 known archaeological sites, of which 245 are
prehistoric and 113 are historic. As stated earlier, only two known sites are mapped within 2 km of the
transmission line, and neither are within the Cuero I National Register District.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Prehistoric Background
The project area is located near the northeastern edge of the South Texas Archeological Region as defined
by Hester (1995). Ellis et al. (1995) note the inaccurate homogenization that occurs when writing about an
area as diverse as south Texas. Indeed, at various times south Texas shares diagnostic artifacts with the
Southern Plains, central Texas, the Lower Pecos, and the Coastal Plains regions. The prehistory of south
Texas is not clearly delineated, but the basic chronological divisions of Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Protohistoric provide a framework. A more detailed account of south Texas prehistory
will be included in the final version of this report.

Historic Background
Several early Spanish expeditions passed through the area of Dewitt County, the first being that of Alonso
de Leon in 1689 during his fourth attempt to locate La Salleâs fort. De Leon probably followed existing
Indian trails, and several later expeditions followed his basic route on their way to the coast or to the
Caddo region in east Texas.

337

The routes either blazed or followed by these expeditions eventually became part of a network of roads
and trails used by Spanish officials and citizens to traverse the province. The first Spanish routes from
San Antonio to east Texas and Los Adaes followed the network of roads known as the El Camino de los
Tejas, or the Upper Road, but from the 1720s onward, travelers shifted their routes southward, probably
due to threats from Apaches and Comanches. The new route became known as the Lower Road, which
ran southeastward from San Antonio to the Cuero area, and turned to the north to join the Upper Road
east of the Brazos River. Although both trail systems remained in use, most official traffic followed the
lower road until the closing of the Los Adaes mission (NPS 2011). Near Cuero, the Lower Road crossed
the Guadalupe River.
Starting in 1750, a new route into Texas from Mexico was established through Laredo, running to La
Bahia and then up the San Antonio River to San Antonio. After 1755, a branch from the Laredo Road was
extended northeastward to connect with the Lower Road in the Cuero area. None of these roads crossed
the area which no makes up the T-198 right of way.
In 1825 the Mexican government granted permission for Green DeWitt and James Kerr to establish a
colony between the Lavaca and Guadalupe Rivers (Roell 2010a). Early population clusters in the colony
included the Irish Creek Settlement near the present town of Verhelle, and the Upper Cuero Creek
Settlement near present-day Cuero. After independence from Mexico, DeWitt County was established in
1846. The county seat was moved frequently during the first four years but eventually settled on Clinton.
In the 1840s and 1850s many German immigrants chose to settle in the areas west and south of Irish
Creek. At one point half the county population was German.
The town of Cuero was founded in 1872 as a midway point during construction of the Gulf, Western
Texas and Pacific Railway between Indianola and San Antonio (Roell 2010b). Cuero grew rapidly, helped
in part from refugees from Indianola after it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1875. A year later, Cuero
replaced Clinton as the county seat.
Cuero continued to grow and prosper, with increasing industry and livestock exports, including the
budding Cuero turkey industry (Roell 2010b). Residents dealt with the lawlessness of the late 1800âs by
forming a quasi-military group called the Home Protection Club, which assisted local law enforcement. In
the 1920âs, the local dam on the Guadalupe River was the largest in the state, and generated electricity for
the town. The turkey industry took off, and the residents started the Cuero Turkey Trot, a parade where
the birds were herded through the town to the dressing plant. This later evolved into the Cuero Turkey
Festival, which is still held annually. Oil was not exploited in the area until 1929, despite years of
speculation in the town.
The town continued to grow through the Great Depression, and hit 5,474 residents by the mid 1940âs. The
townâs primary export remained cattle, but chicken surpassed turkey as the second highest export around
this time. The townâs population peaked in 1969, at 7,800 residents, and dropped to just 6,751 in 2000
(Roell 2010b).
The town of Yoakum sits on the Lavaca-Dewitt county line, and was originally granted to John May in
1835 (Orozco Vallejo 2010). May used the property as a gathering point for cattle to be driven up the
338

Chisholm Trail. In 1887, the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway was built through the area, and the
town was laid out and named after the rail line manager, Benjamin F. Yoakum. By 1896, the town had
boomed, thanks to the rail line, and boasted a cotton mill, three cotton gins, a cotton compress, a bank, an
ice factory, several churches, general and specialty stores, and a school system with 700 pupils. The
population was 3,000 in the 1896, but boomed to 7,500 by 1914. In 1919, resident Carl Welhausen started
Tex-Tan, a tannery and leather shop that would later become the Tandy Corporation.
The town continued to be supported by the railroad and the tomato and leather industry (Orozco Vallejo
2010), but dropped in population, hitting 4,733 in 1940. The town experienced growth after this, and
reached 6,148 in 1984. The population was 5,731 in 2000.

METHODOLOGY
This survey was designed to locate and record cultural resources within areas to be affected by the
proposed overhaul project. High probability areas were generated based on topography and distance from
water. A comprehensive map search failed to locate maps of significant age to generate historic high
probability areas based on mapped structure locations.
Structures proposed for replacement that fell within high probability areas were subjected to pedestrian
survey for 15 meters in all directions, and one shovel test was excavated within 10 feet of the structure.
Stream crossings were selected for survey based on how they looked on both USGS topographic and
aerial maps, with shallow drainages and those with clearly visible crossings not being as thoroughly
investigated, and drainages that looked well incised or otherwise possibly requiring bank modification to
cross were given special attention.
Of the 39 structures being replaced, 28 fell within areas selected as having high probability for prehistoric
cultural resources, and eight stream crossings were selected for survey.

RESULTS
A total of 26 shovel tests were completed during fieldwork on November 8th, November 15th and 16th, and
November 18th, 2016. Thirty-one structures were surveyed via pedestrian survey, another six were
surveyed via windshield survey, and all eight stream crossings were surveyed, all of which appeared to
have good crossing points in place, or otherwise would not need to be crossed because of alternate access
routes. Four structures (5/4, 5/5, 7/5, 9/2) were reassessed in the field as having low probability based on
either slope or clear disturbance. One structure, 5/2, was reassessed in the field as having high probability
for cultural resources, and was subsequently shovel tested. Structure 5/6, which is considered to be in a
high probability area, was not tested due to sudden onset of inclement weather. However, there were
several pocket gopher backdirt piles surrounding the structure, and no cultural materials were observed in
any of these. Further, several structures in similar settings to 5/6 were tested along the T-198 line, and
lacked cultural materials. LCRA Cultural Resources staff considers 5/6 adequately surveyed. No new

339

archaeological sites were recorded as a result of this survey, and with the exception of an isolated find, IF
#1, the survey was completely negative for Cultural Resources.
IF #1
Isolated find #1, or IF #1, is located just south of structure 13/4, approximately 2 km northeast of the
Cuero Substation where the T-198 line originates. Pedestrian survey located a tertiary flake fragment and
a possible polyhedral core 10 to 20 meters south of the structure and around a dirt track road that runs
along the eastern side of the right of way. Shovel tests 1 through 3 were excavated around the structure
and area of the finds, but no conclusive cultural materials were observed. A possible flake fragment was
observed in shovel test 1, however this was dismissed because of the high content of randomly crushed
and shattered chert debris in all three shovel tests. LCRA Cultural Recourses staff does not feel that the
material represents an archaeological site, but rather two randomly deposited or displaced artifacts.

SUMMARY
An intensive Cultural Recourses Assessment of the proposed T-198 Overhaul project was completed
between November 8th and 18th, 2016. Locations of proposed structure replacements that fell within high
probability areas, or were otherwise assessed as high probability in the field, were surveyed within 15 m
of the structures, and shovel tested when necessary. Out of a total 13.8 miles of transmission line, 11.15
miles (135 acres) were driven and surveyed via windshield survey. A total of 14.8 acres of right of way
were surveyed via pedestrian survey, and 26 shovel tests were conducted, assessing 37 of the 39
structures to be replaced. No new archaeological sites were recorded as a result of this survey, and no
SAL-eligible cultural resource sites will be affected as a result of work. LCRA Cultural Resources staff
recommends that all work proposed for this project be allowed to proceed without restrictions. Standard
emergency discovery procedures will be in effect.

Project 37.16: Intensive Cultural Resources Assessment of LCRAâs Proposed Bergheim
Substation Upgrade Project, Comal County, Texas

By Steven R. Evans and Valerie Werfel

Principal Investigator

TAC Permit 7531
Interim Report 10.16
December 2016

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to build an addition onto the AEP-owned
Bergheim Substation, which sits just off of Blanco Road, 1.6 miles south of Highway 46, in Comal
County, Texas. The existing substation is the intersection point of four LCRA transmission lines: T-238,
T-329, T-389, and T-493. Property adjacent to the AEP property is being acquired for the new substation
addition, the planned footprint of which will be approximately 23.2 acres. The subsequent cultural
resources investigation for the substation upgrade was conducted within this known project area, although
the area being purchased has recently risen to approximately 53.4 acres. The total purchase area was not
surveyed, and there are no anticipated impacts outside of the surveyed project area.
Following a map and file review, a cultural resource survey was conducted on December 7th, 2016. No
known archaeological sites are present within or adjacent to the work area, and while three isolated
artifacts were observed, no new archaeological sites were recorded in the course of this investigation. A
total of 15 shovel tests was excavated across the project area, exceeding the CTA survey standards for the
acreage. Much of the project area also consisted of very shallow or exposed limestone bedrock, and
visibility was consistently high.
The project was conducted under the terms of LCRAâs 2016 blanket permit 7531 in accordance with the
Memorandum of Understanding between LCRA and the Texas Historical Commission. This interim
report will be presented in final form within LCRAâs annual report of cultural resource investigations for
2016. There is no known or anticipated federal funding or permitting for this project.
No artifacts were collected in the course of this survey. Field Documents for this project will be submitted
to an accredited curation facility. It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located in the western corner of Comal County, just west of the city of Bulverde. It is
within a section of the eastern Edwards Plateau that takes up most of central Texas. The Edwards Plateau
is distinguished as being an elevated region formed by marine deposits of shales, limestones, sandstones,
and dolomites 100 million years ago when the region was covered by ocean during the Cretaceous Period.
The western portion, where the project is located, is a relatively flat elevated plateau (Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department [TPWD] 2017). The present project area crosses soils that are equally distributed
between Denton silty clay soils (DeB) on the western half and Brackett- Rock complex soil (BtD) on the
east (Soil Survey Staff 2017). Table 1 lists the basic characteristics of these soils. Much of the area is
heavily deflated, and consists of either exposed bedrock, or pockets of around 10 cm of soil atop the
bedrock. Other areas display moderate soil disturbance due to the existing substation located on the
southeastern edge of the project area. The Bergheim Substation is located within the San Antonio River

Basin, and is to the east of Kelly Creek. Vegetation in the area is dominated by low quality browse, forb,
and grass plants such as Ashe-juniper and red berry juniper (cedar). Live oak, shin oak, Texas oak,
blueberry juniper, mesquite, lotebush, yucca, prickly pear, persimmon, hackberry, catclaw, prickly ash,
bumelia, and sumac species are also common in the area. (TPWD 2017)

Staff, 2017).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
An internal file review, as well as a review of the THCâs online Archaeological Sites Atlas, showed that
the Bergheim substation has never been previously assessed for cultural resources. The Atlas further
showed that the nearest prehistoric site, 41CM282, is just over 3 miles to the west of the project area. An
upland open campsite, 41CM282 was determined to be ineligible by the THC in 2006. Site 41CM206, a
12-x-14-foot stone chapel known as the Draessel Chapel, is the closest recorded historic site at 1.85 miles
northeast of the substation. Site 41CM206 has not been given an official eligibility ruling.

METHODOLOGY
This investigation was designed to locate and assess any cultural material present in within the project
area. The entire project area was surveyed via pedestrian survey. This was accomplished by having four
archaeologists (Andrew Malof, Mike Smith, Valerie Werfel, and Steven R. Evans) walk 30-meter-wide
transect paths across the project area, in a north-south orientation. Shovel testing was then conducted in
areas where isolated artifacts had been observed, and where enough soil was present.

RESULTS
Survey work was conducted on December 7, 2016 (Figure 157). Much of the project area consisted of
extremely shallow soils over limestone bedrock, exposed bedrock, or dense gravel lacking soil. A total of
15 shovel tests was excavated, and all were negative for cultural material. Four isolated artifacts were
located. These artifacts, a flake, a small biface fragment, a projectile point (Figure 158), and a complete
biface (Figure 159), were not within sufficient proximity to each other to be considered a site. All four
were subjected to a more intense pedestrian survey in the immediate vicinity, and had a shovel test
excavated in adjacent soil. After the survey had been completed, it was learned that a large buried
350

waterline had been run across the area, and potentially exposed the projectile point and flake, which were
within about 30 m of a large back dirt pile.
A set of concrete building remains were also discovered during pedestrian survey. A review of internal
transmission line plans from past transmission line construction projects revealed the remains to likely be
those of a former substation in the same spot (Figure 160). The remains consist of concrete curbs and
blocks with exposed rebar, and appear to be relatively modern. The aerial plan on which the substation is
visible dates from 1979, though the age of the aerial image is unclear. LCRA Cultural Resources staff do
not feel that these concrete remains are significant, nor that they warrant recording as an archaeological
site.
While the area shown as the project area was originally all that was to be purchased, it is still the only
area in which ground disturbing activity is planned. If plans shift and require ground disturbance outside
of this project area, further survey will be necessary in any portion of the purchased area to be affected.
The decision to purchase the larger area encompassing the project area was made after the survey was
completed, otherwise further survey would have been conducted. Under the current project plans, LCRA
Cultural Resources staff are confident that no SAL eligible cultural resources will be affected, and
recommend that the project be allowed to proceed within the project area without restrictions.

SUMMARY
LCRA Cultural Resources Staff conducted an intensive archaeological assessment of the 23.2 acres of a
53.4-acre plot that are to be affected by the Bergheim substation addition. Because no archaeological sites
were recorded, and what cultural material that was observed was surficial and isolated, LCRA staff
recommends that all currently proposed work be allowed to proceed without restrictions.
Standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place, and should any previously undiscovered
cultural resources be discovered in the course of the addition, work in the immediate vicinity of the
discovery will cease, and LCRA Cultural Resources staff will be contacted to determine what, if any,
mitigation efforts are necessary.

Projects, and Projects Cleared through File Searches.
During calendar year 2016 there were 15 projects that were cleared internally through memos
from LCRAâs Cultural Resources staff to project managers. These efforts included five electrical
substation projects, four transmission line projects, one vegetation management project, three
park maintenance and development projects, a waterline, and the automation of a canal system.

Project 2.16 T-184 Overhaul Project
County: Caldwell
Type of Investigation: File Search and Field Survey
Date of investigation: April 21, 2016

The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed T-184 Overhaul Project which extends from the Lockhart
Substation to the Luling Substation in Caldwell County, Texas. The overhaul will include the
replacement of 21 H-frame structures with new H-frame structures. Additionally, one existing 3pole steel structure will be replaced near an existing lattice tower structure. Generally, all new
structures will be erected within 10 to 15 feet of the existing ones.
Cultural resources staff conducted a search of internal files, as well as of the Texas Historical
Commissionâs Site Atlas. The file search showed that there are nine previously recorded cultural
resource sites within the T-184 corridor. The file search indicated that one of the proposed pole
replacements lies within the boundaries of previously recorded site 41CW122. The file search
also suggested that previously recorded site 41CW9 is situated near two other proposed pole
replacements. Last of all, the file data indicated that all previous LCRA fieldwork within the
transmission line corridor had been conducted for line maintenance. Such cultural resource work
is generally restricted to areas having existing brush and trees within the right-of-way that will
require clearing. Additionally, such work does not typically include intensive, deep shovel
testing to search for buried sites. Overall, it appeared that a cultural resource survey for the
currently proposed project was warranted.
On April 8 and 15, 2016, LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services team field surveyed all 15 pole
structure locations thought to have any potential to impact cultural resource sites. The work
involved recording any unrecorded cultural resource sites and revisiting all previously recorded
sites that might be affected and assessing their significance. The survey method involved
inspecting the ground surface within 15 meters of each of the pertinent structures, and excavating
shovel tests near the structure poles to detect any subsurface cultural material. A total of 17
shovel tests were completed, with only structures 32/2 and 36/7 receiving no shovel tests, both
due to a lack of soil depth and gravelly surface. One new cultural resources site was discovered,
site 41CW171, and two previously recorded sites, sites 41CW9 and 41CW122 were revisited and
re-assessed.
41CW9
This previously recorded prehistoric site is located on the second terrace above the combined
Plum Creek and Dry Creek floodplain. Dry Creek, which is the closer channel to the site,
358

currently lies 700 meters west of the site (Figure 1). A smaller intermittent tributary creek is
situated about 100 meters northeast of the site. Although the one existing transmission pole
structure situated within the site will not be replaced, it is possible that LCRA vehicles may travel
over the site to replace structures to the immediate north and south of the site. For this reason,
41CW9 was briefly revisited during the field survey.
The site is described as a âknapping siteâ on the original site form that was filled out by
avocational archaeologists Orchard and Kelly of the South Texas Archeological Association in
1974 apparently during a general survey of portions of Caldwell County. Review of the original
site form indicates that the 1970âs era landowner, Mrs. Buelah Liscombe, had collected 25 to 30
projectile points from the site. The projectile points included several Paleoindian points of the
Dalton and Plainview and Golondrina types along with some of the Pedernales and Tortugas
types. Information on the form also suggests that the site extends further eastward to the area
where a house was located, perhaps the Liscombe home.
During the revisit, cultural materials consisting of about 20 pieces of chert chipping debris and 2
cores were visible at the designated site location on a highly eroded terrace top. No diagnostic
artifacts or features were found nor were any definite burned rocks or other artifact classes such
as bone, shell or pottery seen. Within the transmission line corridor, topsoils appear to be almost
totally absent except at the east end of the site. The erosion is probably due to previous cultivation
and root plowing.
Based on the previous site form and the current field observations, the site appears to be a
prehistoric lithic scatter/lithic procurement site that dates from the Paleoindian Period through the
Late Archaic. No shovel testing was undertaken during the current investigation due to the lack of
topsoil. The LCRA Cultural Resources Team assesses the part of the site within the transmission
line corridor as not eligible for formal designation as an SAL. No special precautions are
recommended for this site during the upcoming overhaul project.
41CW122
This prehistoric lithic procurement site was originally recorded by the LCRA Cultural Resources
Team during a partial survey of the T-184 due to upcoming maintenance activities on the line in
2008. The site is located on the second terrace of Sixmile Branch which lies 200 meters northeast
of the site as measured along the T-184 corridor. Topsoil at the site is a thin deposit of Queeny
gravelly loam. Chert, quartzite and petrified wood gravels are thickly strewn across the surface of
the site (Figure 2). A large amount of the gravel material is chert.
The original recorders noted that chert debitage, most of which had cortex suggestive of early
stages of reduction, was present across the two lobes of the terrace in an area measuring 100
meters on a northeast

to southwest line by 50 meters on a southeast to northwest line. A few chert cores were also
evident. Patina was noted on some of the artifact surfaces. The site was described as having little
depth and most of the chert cobbles on the slopes appeared to be small. A pile of flakes and cores
were found near the existing LCRA pole structure within the site. The pile was probably left by
360

relic hunters, and their collecting of the site might explain the absence of bifaces and other tools.
Overall, the portion of site 41CW122 within the transmission line corridor was assessed by
LCRA as not eligible for formal designation as a SAL.
Since the one existing pole structure within the site is to be replaced during the current project,
the site was revisited on April 8, 2016 (Figure 3). The revisit confirmed the previous description
and assessment of the site. Although chert debitage and cores are present, no diagnostic artifacts
or features were seen during the current visit. At the current pole location, the terrace lobe is quite
small and the north end of it slopes down very steeply. Since these physical conditions suggest
that LCRA personnel will need to approach the terrace lobe from areas outside the ROW to the
west, that area was surveyed during the current investigation. Occasional chert chipping debris
related to 41CW122 was seen in the area west of the ROW but as with the area within the ROW
no diagnostic materials or features were apparent. The LCRA Cultural Resources Team continues
to assess the site as not SAL eligible, and recommends that replacement of the pole structure be
permitted to proceed.

Site 41CW171
Site 41CW171 extends from a ridgetop, down a north facing slope for 50 m and down a south
facing slope for 115 m, for a total of 150 m within the 30 m right of way easement (Figure 4;
Figure 5). The site is situated on Fett gravelly soils, but has been deflated down to dense gravels
on the slopes. Vegetation surrounding the site includes post oak, elm, mesquite, and some Ashe361

juniper, with short grass, younger mesquite trees, and prickly pear and tasajillo cactus in the right
of way. While the drainage to the north is more substantial, the drainage that abuts the site to the
south has a shallow channel and drains into a stock pond. A road has been built across the top of
the ridge running east to west across the site.
Site 41CW171 was discovered while shovel testing the location of structure 36/5. Shovel Test
#11 which was excavated to a depth of 40 cm through sandy loam topsoil and well into
underlying dense gravel revealed a variety of flakes and flake fragments, as well as a core and a
few pieces of burned sandstone and quartzite. Shovel Test #12 was subsequently placed 17 m
south of the first, and was terminated at 18 cm due to heavy gravel, with only 2 flakes and 2 flake
fragments observed. A general lack of soil depth and clear presence of surficial cultural material
precluded further shovel testing.
Site 41CW171 has been interpreted as a lithic procurement site. Chert cobbles are abundant
across the surface of the site, and cores and debris from several stages of lithic reduction are
present as well, but burned rocks were not observed in sufficient quantity to indicate camping
activities. Most of the site is surficial. The northern boundary was determined by a sudden lack of
artifacts on the deflated surface, and the southern boundary by the drainage in that direction.
While chert cobbles exist to the south of that drainage, no more cultural material was observed on
the other side, and a negative shovel test had already been completed at structure 36/6âs location
50 m to the south of the drainage, where soil depth resumed.
Unfortunately, the crest of the ridge is currently covered by Another Fine Mess Lane, a public
gravel road. Surface inspection indicated that that area would have held the best soil depth, and
perhaps the most

intact deposits. However, the sites surficial nature and disturbance, as well as a lack of diagnostic
artifacts or discrete deposits, leave the site with little to no research value beyond basic locational
and compositional data. For this reason, LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommend that the part
of site 41CW171 within the transmission line ROW be considered ineligible for formal SAL
status, and that the replacement of structure 36/5 within the site be allowed to proceed without
restrictions.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA Cultural Resource staff completed a survey of locations along the T-184 electrical
transmission line where existing structures will be replaced. One previously recorded site,
41CW122, contains a proposed replacement structure within its boundaries. Additionally, LCRA
vehicles may travel over previously recorded site 41CW9 during work on nearby structure
replacements. Both sites were originally recommended as ineligible for formal SAL listing, and
both were assessed as remaining illegible. One new site, 41CW171, is a lithic procurement site
assessed as ineligible for formal SAL status as well. It is recommended that removal and
replacement of all proposed structures be allowed to proceed without restrictions. Additionally,
the investigation indicates that vehicular traffic can be allowed across site 41CW9. The project
may therefore proceed without additional cultural resources coordination, with the understanding
that if unexpected buried artifacts are encountered during construction, then ground disturbance
will halt in the area of discovery until LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff can be notified
and the find evaluated. The results of this investigation will be reviewed by THC within LCRAâs
Annual Report of Cultural Resource Investigations for 2016.

Addendum to Cultural Resource Assessment for the LCRAâs proposed T-184 Overhaul
Project, Caldwell County, Texas
The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs Cultural Resources staff recently completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed T-184 Overhaul Project which extends from the Lockhart
Substation to the Luling Substation in Caldwell County, Texas. After the completion of this
assessment, LCRA transmission line engineers added 3 more structures to those being replaced.
These three structures, structures 35/4, 36/1, and 36/3, were all in high probability areas, as
identified in the file search and map review conducted for the other structures being replaced
along this line, and subsequently needed to be surveyed for cultural resources (Figure 161. A map
of the three new replacement structure location with the shovel tests shown.).
On May 5th, 2016, survey of the three structure locations was conducted. This process included
surveying the area of the new structure locations via pedestrian survey, and digging a shovel test
at the new structure location. No cultural resource sites were encountered in this process.
The three new structure locations are considered fully surveyed. Therefore, work replacing the
three structures may proceed without restrictions. Standard emergency discovery procedures are
in effect, and if any previously unknown cultural resources are encountered in the course of work,
ground disturbing activity in the immediate area of the discovery must cease, and Cultural
Resources staff should be contacted at extension 6714.

Project 5.16 Muleshoe Bend Waterline
County: Burnet
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: January 15, 2016

LCRA proposes to reroute an existing water line that serves the park host site at Muleshoe Bend (Figure
162). The waterline will be about 150 feet in length and will be placed within 1-foot-wide by 1-foot-deep
trench.
Although the line is within an area technically surveyed for the park host site, it is also within the mapped
boundary of prehistoric lithic scatter 41TV502. The site was first recorded around 1980 by Steve Kotter,
then revisited and enlarged by Andrew Malof in 1997. The site consists of scattered lithic debris, possible
fire-cracked rock, and a few tools. There is little to no recognizable patterning or distribution.
The portion of the mapped site was visited by an LCRA staff archaeologist on January 14, 2016. The
trench will run through gravelly upland soils. No artifacts were seen along the proposed pipeline route,
although a few flakes were visible some distance to the south.
Given the very limited nature of the project and the fact that no artifacts were visible on the shallowsoiled surface, the project was given internal clearance, with the understanding that if any artifacts are
encountered they will be marked internal staff and any additionally-needed assessments will be
conducted.

Project 10.16 Camping loop at Turkey Bend Recreational Area
County: Burnet
Type of Investigation: Survey
Date of Investigation: February 16, 2016

In response to an Environmental Checklist, a cultural resources survey of a proposed new Turkey Bend
camping loop was performed by LCRA Cultural Resources staff on February 9, 2016 (Figure 163). The
checklist states that there will be eight camping pads constructed with wood borders infilled with
decomposed granite, a fire ring, a grill stand, a shade shelter, and an anchored picnic table. The pads will
be located on the outer edge of an existing road loop and place at semi-regular intervals over a distance of
about 350 m. For the purposes of the assessment the area of potential effect is approximately 3 acres.
Upon arrival it was found that decomposed granite had been compacted upon the existing ground surface
with an approximate 1-foot-diameter (30 cm) concrete-filled hole and anchoring chain in each. Holes for
sign posts were also visible, and were about 6 inches (15 cm) square to a depth of 12-18 inches (30-40
cm).
A single shovel test was placed adjacent to each pad site, which were numbered in the field as 1-8,
beginning at the northeast then following the layout clockwise (Figure 164). Tests were initially
excavated to a depth of one meter, but based on consistency of soil (loamy sand and sandy loam) they
were later excavated to depths between 60 and 70 cm, well below the maximum depth of anticipated
impact. Two tests were positive for cultural material; a single flake fragment in the upper 20 cm at Pad 1
and a single small chert chip between 60 and 80 cm at Pad 2. The recovery at Pad 1 caused a second
shovel test to be placed on the opposite side of the pad, and it was negative. The relative lack of artifacts
did not warrant listing as an archaeological site, and suggests that there are no intact archaeological
deposits in the upper 70-100 cm of soil at the location of the camping pads. Therefore, there is no need for
additional cultural resource assessment for the project as described. This project will be reported to the
Texas Historical Commission under TAC Permit 7131 within the annual report for 2016.

Project 13.16 FEMA Hazard Mitigation Program at Lost Pines North Area/Camp Swift/Lake
Bastrop
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: Survey
Date of Investigation: February 26, 2016

In February 2016, the Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff conducted a
file search and field survey for a proposed brush clearing project encompassing 174 acres on the north
shore of Lake Bastrop. This project is a component of the Federal Emergency Management Agencyâs
(FEMA) Bastrop County North Lost Pines Hazardous Fuels Reduction Project, which encompasses a
total of 4,664 acres, 1,825 acres of which are in the area of potential effects (APE), and includes funding
from FEMAâs Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. This project is a response to the massive 2011 wildfires
which affected the region.
The project is intended to reduce understory vegetation, and thereby the risk of large wildfires, while
leaving pine and hardwood trees standing. The project area falls entirely within protected Houston toad
breeding habitat, which precludes ground disturbances and has the benefit of protecting most cultural
resources within the APE as well. Trees would be cut at ground level and the stumps would not be
removed. Removed vegetation would be mulched and left on the ground to a depth of no more than two
inches. No vegetation will be removed within 30 feet of standing structures. Additionally, archaeological
sites eligible or potentially eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NR) will enjoy further
protections under section V, paragraph 16 of the projectâs Record of Environmental Consideration (REC).
Vegetation will be hand cut within a 50 meter buffer of site centroids and site 41BP351 will be hand cut
within the entire site boundary. Only man-powered equipment will be used to cut and remove vegetation
in these areas.
LCRA Cultural Resources staff reviewed the project documents, including the REC, and conducted a file
search of LCRA internal archives and the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) Texas Historic Sites
Atlas. The LCRA Cultural Resources team concurs with the Hazardous Fuels Reduction Project
recommendations within LCRA lands, with the exception of site 41BP348 (Figure 1).
Site BP348 is the remnants of a portion of World War II era Camp Swift. This site was first recorded in
1990 during a survey for a proposed Conservation Training Facility for the Texas Parks and Wildlife

372

Figure 1. Lake Bastrop, Texas 7.5â USGS map showing the location of site 41BP348.
Department. The site was recorded as portions of the motor pool for the âWake Islandâ cantonment,
which was an area for non-divisional troops separate from the rest of Camp Swift. The site was
recommended to be of undetermined eligibility for both State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) status and
inclusion on the NR. In 2006, site 41BP348 was listed by the THC as ineligible for inclusion on the NR
and designation as an SAL, but the Cultural Resources staff at the LCRA believes this status change to
have been made in error. As a result, site 41BP348 is not currently listed as eligible or potentially eligible
for the NR or designation as an SAL, the site is currently not protected by the mitigative actions
recommended in the project proposal, and the site is currently at risk for negative impact during this
project, potentially violating both state and federal regulations.
In order to address this and avoid non-compliance with both state and federal law, LCRA Cultural
Resources staff visited site 41BP348 to relocate and assess the site for eligibility for designation as an
SAL or placement on the NR, as well as to develop recommendations for brush clearing methods to
protect the site.
In the course of two days of intensive survey, LCRA Cultural Resources staff redefined the site
boundaries and created an accurate map (Figure using on the ground measurements, GPS points, and GIS.
The following features were located and mapped: 1 standing structure, 26 concrete structure foundations,
9 non-structural features incorporating concrete, and 5 other features, which are 2 earthen features and the
373

remnants of 3 roads. LCRA Cultural Resources staff was able to determine the function of most of the
features by consulting a 1943 map of Camp Swift.
The southern features are indeed associated with the motor pool and include the foundations of a grease
rack with attendant oil houses, wash racks, motor repair shops, oil houses, a fuel pump house and fuel
pumps and store houses. Additionally, the standing structure was labeled as a gas company building and
is of unknown function. A small structure foundation six feet west of the standing structure is also of
undetermined function. Other features included a raised rectangular area of earth, likely the remnants of a
store house location; a depression behind the pump house, likely where a fuel storage tank was removed;
and the remains of three roads, one of which separates the motor pool area from the residential areas.
The northern features are associated with residential structures for the soldiers stationed at the âWake
Islandâ cantonment. The residential area consisted of officer barracks at the northwestern edge of the
cantonment. East of the officersâ barracks were support buildings including storage, recreational, and
administrative structures, as well as the infirmary. The main body of the sub-camp consisted of enlisted
menâs barracks. This area was divided into six units. Each unit accommodated four companies, except the
eastern unit, which only had three companies. Each unit was divided into quadrants, each of which
housed one company. Each company quadrant included six barracks structures, a mess hall, a lavatory,
and a company administration and storage structure. The barracks appear to have been raised pier-andbeam temporary structures and are now completely absent. The mess hall structures were likely of similar

374

construction, though none were located on what is now LCRA property. The lavatories and company
administration and storage structures were constructed with concrete foundations. Five company
administration and storage structure foundations and four lavatory foundations were located on LCRA
property.
As a result of the 2016 survey of site 41BP348, the LCRA Cultural Resources team feels the 2006
determination of the site as ineligible for inclusion on the NR and designation as an SAL was made in
error and recommends the siteâs eligibility for inclusion on the NR and formal designation as a SAL
should remain undetermined, i.e. potentially eligible. The LCRA Cultural Resources relayed its
recommendations about 41BP348 in an email to the Texas Historical Commission, FEMA, and Bastrop
County on February 24, 2016. All parties agreed with LCRAâs recommendation that the siteâs eligibility
status should be changed to the undetermined category, and special conditions should apply to this site as
follows. Similar to site 41BP351, the areas surrounding the structure remnants should be hand cleared of
vegetation but areas within the site boundary yet far enough removed from structure remnants may be
mechanically cleared (Figure 3). Special care should be taken within the area designated as a grease rack.
This area contains approximately 400 small steel brackets embedded vertically in concrete, which may
pose a hazard to both equipment and to the safety of personnel. LCRA Cultural Resources staff will flag
avoidance areas on-site in advance of vegetation clearing activities.

Project 16.16 T-260 Paige Split-to-Elgin Switch Transmission Line Overhaul Project
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: Survey
Date of Investigation: May 11, 2016

The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff has completed a cultural
resource investigation for the proposed T-260 Paige Split-to-Elgin Switch transmission line overhaul
project (Figure 165). The portion of the T-260 transmission line between the Paige Split and the Elgin
Switch is 35.68 km (22.17 mi) long, and contains 31 structures proposed for replacement.
Cultural Resources staff conducted a file and map search, which concluded that the majority of the
section of line in question had not been previously surveyed for the presence of cultural resources. The
map search resulted in the creation of high probability areas for both historic and prehistoric materials.
These high probability areas were then compared to the 31 structures being replaced, and 19 structures
were selected for field survey. One additional structure was added based on observations in the field.
Field survey on this section of the T-260 line occurred on April 26th and 27th, and May 5th, 2016. Each
structure considered to be in a high probability area was surveyed via pedestrian survey, usually for at
least 20 m in either direction and across the 30 m right of way easement. When possible, a shovel test was
then excavated as close to the new structure location as possible (usually within 3 m of the location on a
GPS).
A total of 19 shovel tests were excavated during field work, covering 18 of the 20 selected structures.
Structures 10/7 and 18/5 were not tested because of standing water at their locations. All shovel tests were
negative for cultural resources. In the course of investigating high probability structure locations, an
isolated find and the remains of an historic barn were encountered, neither of which are considered to be
at risk from the current project.
The first of these was a small scatter of flakes on the periphery of the right of way, 35 m northwest of
structure 16/5. The scatter consisted of two definite flakes and some associated chert debris on a deflated
surface (Figure 166). A shovel test was excavated in the area to the southwest of this scatter where soil
resumed, in addition to at the structure location. No subsurface material was observed, and Cultural
Resources staff did not feel that such a small scatter warranted site status. In addition, its location in the
periphery of the right of way means that it will likely not be affected by transmission line construction.
The historic barn remains appeared to be early to mid-twentieth century in origin (Figure 167). Despite
the apparent age of its design, no associated artifact scatter was observed. The structure remains are
located within the edge of the right of way, but are separated from the functional portion of the right of
way by a fence. It is not believed that the structure will be affected by construction, but Cultural
Resources staff does recommend avoiding the structureâs remains. The transmission line structure
376

adjacent to the historic structure, structure 13/6, is not among those being replaced at this time. If
construction threatens to disturb this structure in the future, however, a more thorough investigation
should be completed.
All proposed structure replacement locations considered to have high probability for cultural resources
have been surveyed. Work replacing these structures may proceed without restrictions in the currently
proposed areas. If additional structures are to be replaced, or construction requires otherwise unplanned
ground disturbing activity, LCRA Cultural Resources staff would need to be contacted to assess affected
areas. Standard emergency discovery procedures are in effect, and if any previously unknown buried
artifacts are discovered in the course of work, ground disturbing activity in the immediate area of the
discovery should halt, and Cultural Resources staff should be contacted to determine what, if any,
additional investigations are necessary.

Project 19.16 Wastewater line at Mansfield Dam Low water Crossing Park
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: Survey
Date of Investigation: May 13, 2016

On May 11, staff was shown an image that indicated a wastewater line that is routed between the
park host site and the new bathroom in the day use area would run directly through site 41TV525,
near an area where buried feature material is present. On May 12 a site visit was made, and it was
determined that the image was inaccurate, and that the line will run much further to the south,
barely through the edge of 41TV525 (Figure 168).
After confirming with construction and design personnel, an approximate 15-ft buffer was
flagged to the north of the line route, and it was agreed upon the no ground disturbance would
take place north of the buffer.
The project was allowed to proceed.

Project 21.16 Leander to Round Rock Station 2-7 reconnaissance
County: Williamson, Travis
Type of Investigation: Survey
Date of Investigation: May 20, 2016

On April 25, 2016, at the request of project personnel, I conducted a reconnaissance-level cultural
resources assessment of the Moore tract, also known as the location of potential electrical
substation for the proposed Leander to Round Rock transmission line currently under
consideration by the Public Utilities Commission of Texas. The substation site is mapped as just
under 5 acres on an existing 5 acre parcel. This is presently a residential house and associated
wooded land owned by the Moore family (Figure 169). The land is being purchased, but no
construction is imminent.
The Moore parcel is in Edwards limestone formation. It is partially within Crawford clay which
has a dark brown A horizon to 30 cm over slickensides to a depth of around 70 cm where
indurated limestone is encountered. At lower elevations, and largely corresponding to an
intermittent stream, is Georgetown stony clay loam, which has an 18 cm dark brown A horizon
over reddish brown B horizons before limestone is encountered at around 90 cm. The stream is
part of the headwater system of Dry Fork, that eventually drains into Brushy Creek.
The reconnaissance consisted of a pedestrian survey of the entire tract, less the portion
immediately surround the existing house, which appears to be of 1980s construction. No shovel
tests were excavated. Instead, all ground exposures were systematically examined for evidence of
historic or prehistoric artifacts that would indicate an archaeological site is present.
The wooded area south of the house can be roughly divided between a low eroded area to the
southeast of the stream, and a pronounced, non-alluvial terrace rise to the northwest of the stream
(Figure 170). Soils were observed to be shallow and very stony, with tabular chert and limestone
common across the surface.
A single hard-hammer tertiary flake was observed on this higher ground. Given the nature of the
soils, the underlying geological formation, and the presence of the single observed artifact, it is
the professional opinion of the investigator (Malof) that there is a moderate probability that there
are enough artifacts to warrant designation of an archaeological site somewhere on the property.
He is also of the opinion that the potential for there to be a site that might be considered eligible
for State Antiquities Code listing is negligible. There are therefore no cultural resource concerns
with the purchase of the property.

382

Should location 1-7 eventually be chosen for the location of a substation, then a full cultural
resources investigation, possibly with reporting to the Texas Historical Commission, will be
necessary.

Project 22.16 Automation of 11 gates within LCRAâs Oyster Lake canal system
County: Matagorda
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date: November 11, 2016

LCRAâs irrigation division is in a process of automating 11 existing gate structures on the
existing Oyster Lake canal system located in Matagorda County. The work consists of removing
concrete boxes or wooden structures at the smaller gates and replacing them with a pipe, header
and gate, and making slight modifications on larger structures with multiple gates to mount the
automated lifts.
This project is a continuation of a multi-year project. In 2010, Bureau of Reclamation funding for
11 check gate structures in the same region resulted in project review under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act. The review included a brief history of irrigation in the region
and what was known about the canal system. The State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO)
determined âNo Historic Properties Affected: Project May Proceed.â
In 2013, eight structures referred to as the Van Vleck area gates were proposed for similar work,
and shortly thereafter, also in 2013, another five gates were modified, also in the Matagorda area.
In both cases, SHPO determined that no historic properties would be affected. Furthermore, both
of these latter projects were not subject to Section 106, and were exempt from State Antiquities
Landmark consideration due to the fact that none of the structures are listed on the National
Register of Historic Places (NHRP).
A file review of the present project indicates that none are listed on the NHRP, nor within an
NRHP district, and that no archaeological sites are within the vicinity of any of the structures. All
work will take place within canal embankments or channels, which have all been previously
disturbed, and as such do not require archaeological survey.
In order to maintain a record of the structures being modified, the following information is
presented. The 11 structures being modified are known as Cedar Tree, Citrus, Fonden, Franzen,
Head Collegeport, Head Duffy, Oyster Lake #1, #2, # 3 #4, and Possum locks (Figure 171-Figure
179; Oyster Lake 1 and Possum not shown). They are associated with the following canals or
laterals: Ashby, Collegeport, Duffy, Duke, Green, Letulle, Nuclear, Oyster Lake, Slough Ranch,
and Wilkerson.
According to irrigation division records, six of the eleven structures were constructed in the
1990s or later. At least one of the larger structures is inscribed â1952,â which is consistent with
what is known for the other projects, although it is possible some structures may date to the
1930s. It remains unknown when the actual canals were built, as LCRA acquired them in about
385

1960 with very little documentation, with one exception of a detailed map dated 1956. This map
is keyed by main canal, laterals, bridges, and timber or concrete locks. All structures from the
present project that are depicted on this map are shows as timber. Table 21 illustrates the gate
structures for the present project. Gate locations are shown in Figure 180-Figure 182.

Project 26.16 Lake Bastrop North Shore Pavilion Project
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: Survey
Date: July 6, 2016

The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed pavilion project at the Lake Bastrop North Shore Park
(Figure 183). The proposed pavilion will be approximately 30x40 ft with a concrete slab base,
and have a 60 ft sidewalk extension and a 140 ft waterline trench run to it (Figure 184). While the
physical construction area of the pavilion and associated sidewalk and waterline will consist of
barely 0.10 acres, the project design has outlined a 0.66 acre work area. This includes a former
road that runs from an existing paved parking lot to the pavilion location. This road will be used
to move vehicles and equipment to and from the actual pavilion site.
This assessment consisted of a file search and field survey. The file search consisted of a check of
the Texas Historical Commissionâs computerized Site Atlas and the LCRAâs internal cultural
resource files. The file search indicated that the nearest recorded cultural resource site to the work
area, 41BP858, is approximately 190 m to the north-northwest, and is a small historic home site.
A review of historic maps indicated that no historic structures are mapped in the vicinity of the
pavilion project. LCRAâs internal cultural resources files indicated that several projects were
surveyed in North Shore Park and its vicinity, although none in the direct area of effect, and these
surveys indicated a lack of observed prehistoric archaeological material in the park area.
On July 1, 2016, a field survey was conducted by two LCRA archaeologists. The entire work area
was subjected to pedestrian survey, and two shovel tests were excavated on the proposed pavilion
location and location of the proposed sidewalk and waterline (Figure 184). Shovel test 1 was
excavated to a depth of 68 cm, and had a profile relatively consistent with the mapped Edge soils,
though modern trash was observed down to 50 cm. Shovel test 2 was terminated at 19 cm when
an asphalt and gravel layer was encountered. No archaeological material was observed on the
surface or in either shovel test.
LCRA Cultural Resources staff concludes that no cultural resources will be affected by the
proposed pavilion project. Therefore, the proposed work may proceed as currently planned.
Standard emergency discovery procedures are in effect, and should any presently unknown
cultural resources be encountered in the course of work, work in the immediate area of the
discovery should cease, and LCRA Cultural Resources staff should be contacted at extension
2753 so any further assessment can be considered.

Project 27.16 T-546 emergency work
County: Colorado
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date: July 7, 2016

The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed emergency work on the T-546 Transmission line in
Colorado County (Figure 185). In May 2016, the T-546 conductor became entangled with an
adjacent distribution line pole due to high winds. Following the incident, it was recognized that
the line does not meet current National Electric Safety Code (NESC) clearance requirements at 12
structure locations. In order to correct this and bring the line into NESC compliance and prevent
future incidents involving the conductor material on the T-546 transmission line, 11 structures
need to be replaced with taller structures, two structures will need to be added, and clearing of tall
vegetation will need be conducted around four structures.
A file search and map review of the T-546 transmission line was conducted on July 6th, 2016. The
file search consisted of a review of the Texas Historical Commissions online Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas, which showed that no archaeological sites have been recorded on or
adjacent to the transmission line. A review of LCRAâs internal files shows that while the line has
not been surveyed for cultural resources before, a prior file search and map review was conducted
for maintenance and brush clearing activities, and outlined three avoidance areas. Emergency
work will not be conducted in any of these avoidance areas.
Of the structures of being replaced, 3/6, 3/10, and 9/9 are all in low probability areas away from
creeks or drainages. Structures 3/5, 3/7, 9/8 and 9/10, which are the adjacent structures to 3/6 and
9/9, will have vegetation near the line cleared to meet the NESC standard. Of the 8 other existing
structures that need to be replaced, 5 are adjacent to a raised canal to the south and a road to the
north, and 3 are inside of a gravel mine. Of the two areas where structures need to be added, one
of the areas is in between the canal and road mentioned before, and the other is adjacent to a
paved road and an agricultural field. LCRA Cultural Resources staff does not feel that any of
these structures require survey, being in areas with either low probability, heavy disturbance, or
both.
Therefore, the proposed work may proceed, as currently planned. Emergency discovery
procedures are in effect, and should any previously unknown cultural resources be encountered in
the course of work, work in the immediate area of the find should cease, and Cultural Resources
staff should be contacted at extension 2753, to determine what, if any, additional assessment may
be necessary.

Project 28.16 Arco Tap Substation Circuit Breaker Addition
County: Crane
Type of Investigation: Survey
Date: October 3, 2016

The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment of the proposed Arco Tap Circuit Breaker addition project (Figure 1). The
project area mesures approximately 5 acres and is located within eastern Ector County,
approximately 8.2 kilometers (5 miles) northeast of the city of Crane, Texas. Due to the discovery
of nearby sites on a 2002 survey of electrical transmission line upgrades as part of the Rio Pecos
Project (Karbula et al, 2002), the decision was made to investigate the entire Arco Tap property
for cultural resources in order to facilitate any current or future planned work on the property.
Subsequently, a file search and field survey were conducted.
A review of LCRAâs internal files concluded that only the eastern edge of the project area had
been previously surveyed for cultural resources. The THCâs online Archeological Sites Atlas
showed one previous investigation within 4 km and no archaeological sites within 5 km of the
project area (Karbula et al, 2002). A review of current maps of the area showed that previously
recorded sites were found in similar terrain and drainage areas.
Subsequent intensive field survey of the Arco Tap property, which took place August 28, 2016,
revealed no trace of any cultural resource sites. The property is approximately 5 acres in size and
consists of undisturbed fine sandy soil with approximately 80% ground surface visibility. Nine
shovel tests were excavated across the project area. All of them terminated at 90 cm below
ground surface or deeper (Figure 2), and all proved negative for cultural materials
Because no cultural resources sites were discovered during the survey, work may proceed at the
property without restrictions. Should any currently unknown artifacts or cultural features be
encountered in the course of work, work in the immediate vicinity of the find should cease, and
LCRA Cultural Resources staff be contacted at extension 2753 to assess what, if any, further
investigations are necessary.

Project 29.16 Georgetown South Substation property
County: Williamson
Type of Investigation: Survey
Date: August 4, 2016

The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment of the Georgetown South Substation property in response to multiple
upcoming projects on the property (Figure 188). Due to the varying scope of the projects, a
decision was made to investigate the entire substation property for cultural resources, in order to
facilitate any current or future planned work on the substation. Subsequently, a file search and
field survey were conducted.
A review of LCRAâs internal files concluded that the substation had never been surveyed for
cultural resources. The THCâs online Archaeological Sites Atlas showed no surveys or previously
recorded archaeological sites in the vicinity of the substation. A review of current and historic
maps of the area showed that while the substation property and its immediate area do not appear
to have high probability for prehistoric cultural resources, a house and barn were mapped on the
property beginning in 1924.
Subsequent field survey of the substation property revealed almost no trace of the mapped house
or any outbuilding. While the property is approximately 3.89 acres in size, only 2.25 acres of it
are not covered by the substation equipment, and of that, only about 1.4 acres consist of
undisturbed or lightly disturbed soils. About 1.8 acres of the area not taken up by the substation
was heavily disturbed from its construction, with large amounts of soil having been displaced to
level the substation (Figure 189). A fire brick fragment and small glass fragment were located just
outside of the southeast corner of the substation proper, and conventional brick fragment and four
glass fragments were located in the propertyâs northwest corner. Six shovel tests were completed
in areas near artifacts and in the least disturbed areas of soil. All six tests were negative, and all of
them terminated at decomposed limestone or soil with heavy limestone detritus content. Tests
were between 7 and 50 cm in depth. Foreign soil from sod was also apparent as the upper layer of
soil across the property. LCRA Cultural Resources staff does not feel that the small number of
20th century artifacts encountered warrant archaeological site status.
Therefore, work may proceed at the substation without restrictions. Should any currently
unknown artifacts be encountered in the course of work, work in the immediate vicinity of the
find should cease, and LCRA Cultural Resources staff be contacted at extension 2753 to assess
what, if any, further investigations are necessary.

Project 31.16 T-215/232 Brenham to North Chapel Hill Transmission Line Overhaul
County: Washington County
Type of Investigation: Survey
Date: October 20th, 2016

The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed T-215/232 Brenham to North Chapel Hill Transmission Line
Overhaul Project in Washington County (Figure 190-Figure 192). The overhaul will include the
replacement of 24 structures along 9.13 miles of transmission line, in addition to vegetation clearing and
potential modification of stream crossings. All new structures will be erected within 10 to 15 feet of the
existing ones.
Cultural resources staff conducted a file search of internal files as well as the Texas Historical
Commissionâs (THC) online Archaeological Site Atlas. Results of this file search indicated that the T-215
and T-232 corridor had not been previously surveyed, nor had any cultural resource sites been previously
recorded within the right of way. Since new ground disturbance will be generated by the proposed project,
a cultural resources assessment of potentially affected areas was conducted.
Areas containing high probability for prehistoric and historic archaeological deposits were generated
utilizing various historic and modern maps, as well as the THCâs online site atlas. These high probability
areas (HPAâs) were then cross referenced with proposed structure replacements. Structures proposed for
replacement that fell within an HPA were subjected to pedestrian survey for 15 meters in all directions,
and shovel tested when necessary. All historic HPAâs were subjected to pedestrian survey. Streams along
the transmission line were also surveyed for cultural resources, in case transmission line crews need
create or modify crossings.
On October 11 and 12, 2016, LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services team field surveyed the 11 structure
locations that fell within HPA. A total of 17 shovel tests were completed and one new cultural resources
site, site 41WT84, was recorded. Two of the stream crossings encountered were assessed as requiring
modification to cross.
The first crossing was located between structures 20 and 21 and, and the second between structures 3/4
and 3/5. Both had accessible cut banks, and profiles were shaved and examined. Both contain deep
alluvial soils. Crossing one showed no artifacts on ground surface, but recent trash was observed within
the cutbank at about 50 cmbs (cm below surface), and historic refuse was observed in the creek bottom.
While the refuse in the creek bottom was assessed as washout from another area, crossing one clearly has
potential for deeply buried archaeological deposits. No Artifacts were observed on the surface or in the
cutbank of crossing two, but a shaved profile showed deep alluvial deposits. As such, it is recommended
that both crossing be avoided. If this is not possible, Cultural Resources staff should be contacted.
406

41WT84
Site 41WT84 was discovered while surveying a structure location shown on a 1930 USGS map of the
area. Shovel Tests #3 through #8 were excavated to an average depth of depth of 40cm through
predominantly sandy and clay loam topsoil (Figure 193). Site 41WT84 has been interpreted as a historical
trash scatter and buried midden due to the nature of the artifacts and their deposition.
The central portion of the site appears to be a 20-30 cm thick layer of historic refuse dating from around
1920's-1960's, shallowly buried across a slope above a drainage. The layer is tightly compacted and
appears to have been formed and compressed by heavy machinery. Artifacts observed were multiple
shards of aqua, cobalt, green, amber, colorless, and milk glass as well as various pieces of metal, and
multiple pieces of whiteware and transferware ceramic. Bricks with at least five different makersâ stamps
were observed in the area.
The property was owned by a woman named Mariah Waddell, who left it to the city of Brenham in her
will in 1938 (internal easement files). An online file search resulted in little information about Ms.
Waddell, other than that she was possibly African American and may have had the maiden name Bilbow.
The artifacts appear to be too many and too late in age to be solely from the marked structure on the 1930
USGS map. Starting on the 1963 USGS map, the structure is gone, and three gravel pits are shown in the
area just north of the site, where the house would likely have been. One of these gravel pits is shown on
maps until the 1990's. It seems likely that refuse from the gravel mining operation, and possibly the
original house as well, were buried and compressed, intentionally or unintentionally, during earth moving
activities for the gravel pits. Since the property was city owned at least through 1983, when LCRA
purchased its easement, another possible explanation was that the city used the gravel pits and the land to
dispose of trash and bury it until the 1960's. Artifacts are strewn about the ROW and adjacent pasture,
with the most material being centrally located within the site.
No work is currently anticipated within 41WT84, as the site contains no transmission line structures.
However, due to the age and nature of the deposits, the site is considered to have little to no research
value beyond its locational data, and is recommended as ineligible for formal SAL listing within the right
of way. Should future projects threaten to destroy the site, further investigation into the sites origin may
be warranted.
Summary and Recommendations
LCRA Cultural Resource staff has completed a Cultural Resources assessment of the proposed T-215/232
transmission line overhaul. One new Cultural Resources site, 41WT84, was recorded, but is
recommended as ineligible within the right of way. Two surveyed stream crossings, between structures 20
and 21, and 3/4 and 3/5, were assessed as having high potential for deeply buried archaeological deposits,
and are recommended for avoidance. If avoidance of these is not possible, LCRA Cultural Resources staff
should be contacted for further consultation.
The project may therefore proceed without additional cultural resources coordination, with the
understanding that if unexpected cultural resource materials are encountered during construction, then
407

ground disturbance will halt in the area of discovery until LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff can
be notified and the find evaluated. The results of this investigation will be reviewed by THC within
LCRAâs Annual Report of Cultural Resource Investigations for 2016.

Project 34.16 Sherwood Shores Substation Upgrade
County: Comal
Type of Investigation: Survey
Date: December 21, 2016

The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment of the proposed Sherwood Shores Substation project (Figure 1). The project
area measures approximately 390 meters along T-187 and is located within southwestern Burnet
County, approximately 10 kilometers (6.21 miles) northwest of the city of Marble Falls, Texas.
Due to its proximity to a prehistoric archaeological site about 0.6 km to the southwest of the
project area, the decision was made to investigate the new structure locations for cultural
resources in order to facilitate any current or future planned work on the property. Subsequently,
a file search and field survey were conducted.
A review of LCRAâs internal files concluded that the substation portion of the project area had
been previously surveyed for cultural resources, but not the areas of new structure locations. The
THCâs online Archeological Sites Atlas showed one previous investigation within 0.6 km.
Review of current maps of the area showed that previously recorded sites were found in similar
terrain and drainage areas.
Subsequent intensive field survey of the Sherwood Shores property, which took place December
6, 2016, revealed no trace of any cultural resource sites. The property is approximately 390
meters in length and consists of undisturbed gravely sandy loam with approximately 20 percent
ground surface visibility. Two shovel tests were excavated in proposed new structure locations.
Both of them terminated at 40 cm below ground surface or at the water table (Figure 2), and both
proved negative for cultural materials
Because no cultural resources sites were discovered during the survey, work may proceed at the
property without restrictions. Should any currently unknown artifacts or cultural features be
encountered in the course of work, work in the immediate vicinity of the find should cease, and
LCRA Cultural Resources staff be contacted at extension 2753 to assess what, if any, further
investigations are necessary.

Project 39.16 Reconnaissance of potential substation sites 1-8 and 2-8, Williamson
County
County: Williamson
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: March 15, 2016
On March 15, 2016, a cultural resources reconnaissance-level survey was conducted at potential
substation locations 1-8 and 2-8 along proposed segments of a new transmission line, that once
selected, will run between existing substations in Leander and Round Rock (Figure 196).
Location 1-8 is located within a Williamson County-owned park along Sam Bass Road (Figure
197). At present it is used in part as a portion of a disk golf course. Much of the parcel is scrub
brush and cactus. It is located on an upland divide over Edwards formation limestone and
Crawford clay and Georgetown stony clay loam clays. Georgetown soil have an 18 cm clay loam
A horizon while Crawford soils have a 30 cm A horizon. Observed soils were dark clay loams
with concentrations of both tabular and nodular chert, and exposed limestone in places.
The area was systematically transected. Visibility was poor in the northern brushy areas and good
to excellent in the more southerly sections. Soils were clearly shallow. Only two areas with
artifacts were seen. On the eastern edge about three probable flake fragments were present in an
exposure of chert cobbles and limestone bedrock. On the western edge was in isolated large hard
hammer flake that was used either as a flake core or, more probably, as a gouge-like tool (see
Figure 200).
Elsewhere there were numerous pieces of exposed, fractured chert, often patinated, although
usually very thick and lacking characteristics of purposeful reduction. They are likely the result of
repeated fracturing through fires and/or heavy equipment. While shovel testing is recommended
prior to ground disturbing work, it is unlikely that an archaeological site is present, and if one is,
it is highly unlikely it would be of any regulatory or scientific significance.
Location 2-8 fronts Brushy Creek immediately off of Ronald Reagan Blvd (Figure 198). It is over
Fredericksburg Group marl and Denton silty clay loam, which have a 33 cm dark brown silty clay
A horizon. Approximately one-third of the area has been used as a laydown for road construction
materials, and as a result has been scraped to a depth of probably 30-40 cm. The southern section
that abuts Brushy Creek is covered with dense juniper growth with varying visibility due to duff
cover and slope wash from the laydown area.
The non-disturbed portions of the area were systematically transected. The southern edge of the
parcel has a decaying cedar-and-barbed wire fence, and in places has remnants of a stone fence or
low wall. This may be associated with a property to the west, where a relatively old red barn and
outbuilding were observed.

419

Elsewhere, there were several areas where tertiary chert chipping debris was seen, notably at
southeastern corner of the property. Careful examination of exposed ground found flakes and
chips broadly scattered across the wooded area. Fire-cracked limestone was also present, although
typically as a cobble with a single fracture plane, rather than âfist-sizedâ pieces typically
associated with feature material. There was no evidence of burned rock concentrations nor any
areas of raised ground suggestive of burned rock middens.
Two diagnostic artifacts were seen. One was a piece of solarized (purple) glass, located near the
northern edge of the wooded area. Nearby was a carefully-crafted Ensor dart point, made on a
piece of fairly low quality material (Figure 200).
The area was recorded as archaeological site 41WM1375. About 70 pieces of debitage and 30-40
fire-cracked cobbles were seen. Despite the creek-side location, this is at best a slowly aggrading
landform, and may actually be more subject to erosion and deflation. While the site still needs
systematic shovel testing prior to any LCRA-related ground disturbance, it is unlikely that the site
has either a historic or prehistoric component that would have regulatory or scientific
significance. Site 41WM1375 is recommended as having undetermined SAL status because of a
lack of shovel testing.
The two properties were not purchased, and thus no further work was conducted.

Letters to THC Requesting Clearance through File Searches

During calendar year 2016 there were eight projects for which letters were sent to THC. These included the
approval for four electrical substation projects, two transmission line projects, and two projects associated with
parks maintenance and development. The THC concurred with the assessments and recommendations of the
LCRA Cultural Resources staff.

Project 6.16 McKinney Roughs Equestrian Camping Area Development
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: File search and Survey
Date of Investigation: January 28, 2016
LCRA proposes to further develop an area of the McKinney Roughs Nature Park presently used as an
equestrian parking loop and trail head (Figure 201). There are currently two proposed designs for the
development (Figure 202 and Figure 203). Both are within an area previously surveyed (Malof 2006) and
determined to be within an old gravel quarry, with the exception of a service road which will be rerouted
to the west. The rerouted service road will be approximately 1700 feet in length and crosses an area that
could not be demonstrated as having been previously assessed, and during a reconnaissance of the project
area appeared to be in relatively undisturbed soil. The previous survey resulted in the recording of site
41BP675, a lithic scatter determined to be ineligible for formal SAL status. This is the only known site
that will be impacted by the project.
A field assessment of the proposed new service road was performed by LCRA Cultural Resources staff on
January 28, 2016 (Figure 204). Eighteen shovel tests were excavated in undisturbed portions of the
service road route, which had previously been uploaded into a GPS.
The testing revealed a shallow sandy loam and sand over dense gravels and mottled clay across the
service roadâs path. Shovel test 4 encountered a single flake fragment, and subsequent testing of the
surrounding area located a hard hammer flake in shovel test 14. Five additional tests in the area failed to
locate any more cultural material. These two artifacts appear to be isolated occurrences and were not
assigned a trinomial.
Cultural material was also encountered in shovel tests 8 and 10, and the proximity of these tests to
41BP675 resulted in a slight extension of the siteâs boundary and a revisit form to TARL.
Given the disturbed nature of most of the project area, and the results from this survey, LCRA Cultural
Resources staff recommends that the development be allowed to proceed without restrictions. Standard
emergency discovery procedures will apply.

Project 7.16 Acquisition of Brady South substation from the City of Brady
County: McCulloch
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: April 14, 2016
LCRA proposes to purchase and perform minor equipment upgrades to the existing Brady South
substation located in the town of Brady (Figure 205). The substation is approximately 1.5 acres in size on
a 3 acre tract. There will be no new ground disturbance other than for a new 100-foot-long access road
and gate within the existing substation fence (Figure 206).
A review of the Sites Atlas shows no recorded archaeological sites at or near the project area. Historical
maps available through the USGS websites do not indicate previous structures there and the location was
outside city limits in 1921, according to Sanborn Fire Insurance maps.
Given the overall low probability for intact archaeological sites to be present and the very limited scope
of the project LCRA recommends that no field assessment is needed, and that the project should be
allowed to proceed.

Project 9.16 Upton Electrical Substation Project
County: Upton
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: March 11, 2016
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to construct the new Upton Electrical
Substation on a 3.55 acre tract in Upton County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The proposed substation will
be built immediately east of an existing electrical substation that is owned by ONCOR, a private electrical
power company. LCRA will utilize an existing access road that extends along the north boundary of the
proposed substation site for the proposed project (Figure 3). The access road is 9.1 meters (30 ft) wide
and extends for a length of 246 meters (810 ft). LCRA will own the land where the substation will be
constructed and, therefore, a cultural resources review under the Antiquities Code of Texas is required.
Since there is no federal funding or permitting associated with the project, a review under the National
Historic Preservation Act is not applicable.
A file search conducted for the project showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource
sites within the proposed project area. The file search showed that LCRAâs T-441 electrical transmission
line, which runs through the existing ONCOR Upton Substation, was surveyed for cultural resources in
2002 when LCRA purchased the line from Texas Utilities and then upgraded it (Karbula et al. 2002). The
portion of the transmission line corridor in and around the existing ONCOR substation and LCRAâs
proposed new substation were rated as low probability areas and were not field investigated. The low
probability rating was due to the long distance any water source. The closest previously recorded site is
41UT43, which was recorded during the 2002 survey about one mile west of the proposed substation.
This site lies on the west side of an unnamed creek at a distance of 60 to 210 meters from that creek.
The currently proposed LCRA substation lies approximately 550 to 730 meters southeast of the same
unnamed creek where 41UT43 is located. Additionally, substation is over 900 meters northeast of the
closest mapped playa lake feature. The LCRA Cultural Resources Team concludes that the proposed
LCRA substation tract has a low probability for any prehistoric cultural resource sites.
The 1970 Lindsey Ranch, Texas 7.5â USGS map shows a windmill symbol along the access road corridor
and a water tank to the north. According to LCRA Real Estate Services personnel, no windmill is
currently present and the elevated water tank lies to the north of the access road as shown in the
background as shown on the Figure 3 photograph. Additionally, a pump jack currently used to pump
water from a well to the tank is visible even further north of the water tank as also shown on Figure 3.
Based on the location of the pump jack, the former windmill depicted on the topographic map may have
been misplotted and may have once stood in the vicinity of the pump jack.
Based on the file search data concerning prehistoric resources and the information about the water pump
and water tank, the LCRA Cultural Resources staff does not feel that a field survey is warranted. LCRA

436

staff concludes that no cultural resource sites eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks will be affected by the proposed substation project.

Project 11.16 Reroute of existing transmission line T-134 near Moulton
County: Lavaca
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: April 14, 2016
LCRA proposes to provide electrical service to a new substation that will be built and owned by the
Guadalupe Valley Electric Cooperative (GVEC). The new substation will be located immediately
adjacent to LCRAâs existing T-134 transmission line. In order to service the substation the line will make
a 90 degree turn towards the station then another 90 degree turn into the substation from the north. It will
the same thing when it exits the substation to the south (Figure 207). Up to six support structures may be
necessary.
Soils are mapped as Carbengle loam, which has a 30 cm A horizon over B and C horizons, and Frelsberg
clay, which as a 20 cm A horizon over B horizons. The underlying geology is Oakville sandstone.
A review of the Sites Atlas shows no archaeological sites are recorded at the project location. A review of
the detailed 1898 USGS maps shows no structures. Topographically the area appears to have a low
potential for prehistoric archaeological sites.
Given the limited nature of impacts associated with the project and the negative background results,
LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends the project be allowed to proceed as described, with
standard emergency discovery procedures in place.

Project 18.16 Proposed Water Pipeline at Travis Countyâs Pace Bend Park on LCRA Land
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: May 9, 2016
Travis County is proposing to construct a new water pipeline from an existing water well to their park
office complex at Pace Bend Park (Figure 208). The park is on LCRA property, but the land is leased to
Travis County, and Travis County operates the park. Travis County is proposing to place the new pipeline
in an existing electrical distribution line right of way owned by the Pedernales Electrical Co-op (PEC).
The water pipeline would be 2 inches in diameter, and would extend approximately 890 m (2,920 ft)
between the well and the office complex. The pipeline would be laid in a 3-4 ft deep trench excavated by
a mechanical trencher. The PEC distribution line right of way has already been cleared of vegetation, and
the only ground disturbing activity involved will be the trenching within this right of way (Figure 209).
A file search conducted by LCRA Cultural Resource staff found that an intensive cultural resources
survey of the park was conducted by Espey, Huston and Associates in December 1984 (Glander 1985a).
The report states that âvirtually 100%â of the park land above the 680 ft contour (full pool level of Lake
Travis) was surveyed (Glander 1985a: 1). The survey recorded 31 archaeological sites and 33 isolated
finds, and appears to have been diligent and thorough.
Despite having been intensively surveyed for cultural resources, no archaeological sites are currently
recorded along the water pipelineâs proposed path. In fact, the closest that the pipelineâs path comes to an
archaeological site is 230 m (755 ft) from 41TV962, a prehistoric lithic scatter on an upland rise near the
lake shore.
Based on these findings, LCRA Cultural Resources staff has concluded that no State Antiquities
Landmark eligible cultural resource sites will be affected by the proposed work, and recommends that the
trenching and placement of this water pipeline by Travis County be allowed to proceed without field
investigations or restrictions to construction. Standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place,
and should any previously unknown cultural resources be encountered in the course of work, ground
disturbing activity in the immediate area of the discovery will halt until LCRA Cultural Resources staff
can contact the Texas Historical Commission to assess what, if any, avoidance/mitigation efforts are
necessary.
We request your concurrence with our assessments and recommendations for this project. If you need
any additional information, contact me at (512) 730-6714.

Project 23.16 Castillo Substation Modifications
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: June 9, 2016
The following was an email from Andrew F. Malof (LCRA) to Tiffany Osburn (THC), and copied to Bill
Martin, David Camarena, and Casey Hanson
Tiffany [Osburn],
Last fall I believe you reviewed a "no survey" letter request from Dan on a new substation, two tap lines
and a short piece of access road to be located between McCamey and Crane on the Upton/Crane county
line (TAC Permit 7131). The new substation and tap lines are to tie in to a proposed private solar farm.
Your office concurred with the no survey recommendation.
Meanwhile, there have been a couple of modifications. The access road had to be realigned and there will
be 750 feet of a new 30-ft-wide road to be cleared. There will be a temporary 4-acre laydown yard very
close to the substation site. There has been a slight realignment of the tap lines.
In order to maintain the schedule required to coordinate between the various parties, LCRA would like to
begin preparing the access road and laydown yard by July 1 (or 4). Given the relatively minor changes in
an agreed-upon low probability area, I am hoping this email will serve as sufficient means of review for
Permit 7531. I have attached the original letter and map figure along with a new figure showing the
modifications.
I tried to get hold of David Camarena but he's out so Casey [Hanson] was next closest and he suggested
the cc list. Let me know if you have questions or need more information.

Project 33.16 Fayette Power Plant Bus Tie Substation Improvement
County: Fayette
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: September 28, 2016
LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (LCRA TSC) proposes the FPP Bus Tie Project to increase the
capacity at two existing substations, referred to as FPP Yard #1 and FPP Yard # 2 within the Fayette
Power Project plant area. Potential ground disturbing portions of the project consist of the teardown and
partial realignment of an existing 0.26-mile-long transmission line between the two substations, and
construction of a new, parallel transmission line, also approximately 0.26 miles in length. Four
replacement support structures located outside of the existing substations will likely be required.
A cultural resources assessment of the project was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resources staff on
September 27, 2016. The assessment consisted of a map and file review. A search of the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas indicated there are no recorded archaeological sites within the project area.
Although the Atlas does not illustrate an assessment at the precise project location, there have been
numerous studies prior to construction of the plant in the 1970s and subsequently for larger projects such
as ash disposal ponds.
Furthermore, the project is in areas that have undergone numerous disturbances over the decades, and the
potential for significant archeological sites to be present is negligible. Therefore, LCRA recommends that
the project be allowed to proceed as described without further cultural resources consultation, with the
understanding the standard emergency discover procedures will be in place.

Project 38.16 Emergency Cultural Resource Survey of 41BP951
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: November 17, 2016
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is currently conducting maintenance and replacing structures along
the existing T-181/T-229 transmission line in Bastrop County, Texas. LCRA Cultural Resources staff reviewed
the project documents and conducted a file search of LCRAâs internal archives and the Texas Historical
Commissionâs (THC) Online Archeological Sites Atlas. No recorded sites were within the proposed project area
(Figure 1); however, when work commenced, an underground cistern (Figure 3) was discovered and damaged by
the work crews attempting to clear brush near the treeline of the right of way (ROW). The cistern is now
damaged, missing its collar, and is considered a hazard. Work on that section of ROW was immediately halted
until a cultural resources field survey could be conducted.
The field survey, conducted by Valerie Werfel and Steven Evans on November 17, 2016, confirmed the location
of the cistern and revealed a nearby burned trash scatter, which consisted of historical glass and metal fragments,
as well as burned sandstone and brick, and was recorded as 41BP951. The site is located at the top of a small hill
and is approximately 63 meters long and 35 meters wide. A search of Bastrop County deed records was conducted
to establish land ownership chain for the parcel; however, due to unclear deed records of ownership, a precise
chain of deed could not be determined. Because the cistern is constructed primarily of manufactured red brick and
concrete, it is believed to have been built around the 1920s or 1930âs and William Gerbert may have owned the
parcel at the time. This date range is supported by the artifacts present. It was stated by the current landowner that
the cistern and trash pile may have been a part of a nearby barn site; however, no remnants of a barn or any type
of structure were found by Cultural Resources staff.
Due to high ground visibility, the majority of the analysis was done by pedestrian survey with a total of six shovel
tests, all of which were terminated at 40 cmbs or at a clay horizon. Moving from west to east (Figure 2,) the tests
were found to include various pieces of glass, ceramic, metal, and brick fragments in decreasing amounts. Shovel
Test 6 was located at the base of the slope of the hill and was excluded from the site boundary as only a single 1cm2 shard of amber glass was recovered and thought to be run-off scatter from the burn feature.
The site appears to be isolated from any current standing structure or visible structure remnant. It is recommended
as ineligible for formal designation as a State Antiquities Landmark within the ROW, with the area outside of the
ROW being of unknown eligibility. Due to the current work being done on the ROW and the relatively recent
historic construction of the site components, it is recommended that the cistern be filled in for safety of the work
crews and others.
We request your concurrence with our assessments and recommendations for this project. If you need any
additional information, please contact me at 512-578-2753.

Projects Monitored

During the 2016 calendar year, four projects were monitored by archaeologists. These included file
searches and field monitoring for each project, including the monitoring of 1) transmission line
construction near prehistoric site 41GL321; 2) installation of park lights in the vicinity of various known
sites at White Rock Park; 3) electrical line trenches at the Lane City vertical pump station; and 4)
numerous LCRA properties for the FY17 vegetation management project.

Project 8.16 Results of T-120 Transmission Line Construction Monitoring at 41GL321
County: Gillespie
Type of Investigation: Construction Monitoring
Date of Investigation: January 22, 2016
On November 18, 2015, the Texas Historical Commission (THC) agreed that archaeological monitoring
at site 41GL321, located on the south side of the Guadalupe River just south of Fredericksburg (Figure
210), was an adequate method for assessing potentially important prehistoric archaeological deposits at
the location of transmission support structure 18/6 (letter from LCRA to THC dated October 27, 2015).
Pre-construction shovel testing had identified a likely McKinney Plain ceramic rim sherd of Caddoan
origin (from 0-20 cmbs) and a small piece of central Texas Leon Plain pottery (from 40-60 cmbs), as well
as numerous pieces of lithic debitage (flakes), mussel shell, and a thin biface that may have been a large
arrow point fragment (from 40-60 cmbs). Given the relative uniqueness of the rim sherd, it was collected
for further analysis, and subsequently the second ceramic piece was also collected. No other collections
were made; all other artifacts were replaced within their respective holes.
Structure replacement occurred on January 22, 2016. When Cultural Resources staff arrived, the two
poles of the H-frame were ready to be removed. The more westerly of the two poles was removed first,
and was pulled straight out of the ground by way of a crane and tethers. There was minimal ground
disturbance as a result. A truck-mounted auger was then used to clean out and enlarge the holes, from
about 18 inches (45 cm) to about 28 inches (70 cm). The auger removed approximately 2 feet of soil at a
time (60 cm) to a final depth of just over 8 feet (2.4 m), which was then sifted through standard quarterinch hardware cloth (Figure 211). Approximately 60 percent of the soil from each 2-foot zone was
screened.
Following communication with the landowner a 100 percent artifact collection was decided upon. Artifact
recovery was minimal, and is summarized in Table 22. No organic material such as charcoal or bone was
observed, and only a single snail (Rabdotus sp.) was seen. There were a few chips and flakes indicative of
tool manufacture and maintenance, and one edge-modified flake and a possible edge-modified core
fragment were recovered. Possible fire-cracked rock was later determined to be naturally-shaped chert
and cherty limestone. No more ceramics were seen.
The most distinctive items were a large round chert cobble that had been split, with edge battering on one
side. It is suggestive of bipolar reduction. Another large flake from either a well-reduced core or a large
biface was present, but is unusual in that the ventral side has abnormal concave curvature, and may have
two opposite platforms, so may also be the result of bipolar reduction. It appears to have been heat
treated. Also recovered were a few pieces of black chert shatter, including a crude pebble, which
contraindicate a previous hypothesis of non-local (Round Rock area) chert being present.

454

Although safety issues precluded detailed soil profile recording, the soil profiles seemed fairly intact.
Representative soil samples were collected from each of the 2-foot excavation increments (Table 23), and
a

shovel scrape provided confirmation of observed dense gravels from between about 90 and 180 cm.
Despite this, given the crude nature of the excavation, artifact recovery cannot be confidently assigned to
the recorded zones.

The archaeological monitoring was useful in that it demonstrates that the land form is relatively intact.
The thick bed of well-sorted small gravels indicate periods of high-velocity stream flow, and increasing
clay content with depth suggests a fairly stable environment allowing downward clay movement.
Subjectively, there is about 30 cm of an upper soft loam, followed by 60-70 cm of silt loam. Gravels
become very dense between about 1 and 1.7 m, and decrease below that point. Coarse sands were
encountered briefly at the very bottom, about 240 cm (8 feet). The greatest potential for intact cultural
zones is therefore within the upper meter or so of soil, and perhaps at depths below about 2 meters.
Definite subsoils were not encountered, so total soil depth remains unknown.
Artifact recovery during the monitoring was disappointing, and much less than found in previous shovel
testing. While possibly due to previous auguring, it is more likely that the present structure location is
simply in a less dense portion of the site.
All collected artifacts have been returned to the landowner who will either keep or dispose of them, or
return them to LCRA under Deed of Gift to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
Austin.
The overall significance of 41GL321 remains undetermined. If future LCRA work involves significant
new ground disturbance, then additional assessments should be considered.

Project 12.16 Monitoring of White Rock Park Playing Field Lights Installation
County: Fayette
Type of Investigation: Construction Monitoring
Date of Investigation: March 29, 2016
In March 2016, the Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff has completed
monitoring for cultural resources for the White Rock Park Playing Field Lights Installation project in La
Grange, Fayette County. White Rock Park is a La Grange city park located on land owned by the LCRA
and leased to the City of La Grange (Figure 1).
The City of La Grange completed improvements to White Rock Park consisting of installing four light
pole structures at the combination soccer and football field located between the Colorado River and the
park baseball diamonds (Figure 2). The project involved excavating a trench approximately 70 cm deep
and 20 cm wide from an electrical distribution junction 200 m north of the field to run electrical conduits
to the four light poles to be installed. The trench runs 21 m from the electrical junction to the park road
where it stops, then is picked up on the other side of the road, 40 m farther south, where it runs along the
margin of a baseball diamond for 100 m before branching into two trenches. From this branching, one
trench runs along the northern margin of the combined soccer and football playing field and the other
trench runs along the eastern margin of the field to the southeast corner, where it turns and follows the
south field margin. The total length of all trenching was 431 m. The approximately 21 m segment running
underneath the park road was not trenched but rather horizontally bored to avoid trenching and repaving
the road. The four light pole structures were placed in holes 3 ft (1 m) wide and augered to 14 ft (4.3 m)
below the ground surface. Four additional holes approximately 1 m wide and 3 m long were excavated by
a backhoe to allow repair to several PVC french drain pipes and a PVC water pipe damaged during
trenching.
The cultural resources investigations included a file search and field monitoring of the trenching and
augering. The file search consisted of a check of the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) computerized
Site Atlas and the LCRAâs internal cultural resource files. The file search indicated the existence of two
previously recorded sites, 41FY519 and 41FY520, both of which were recorded during a 1992
investigation (Caran et al 1992).
The 1992 survey and backhoe trenching were contracted by the LCRA to the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) to investigate two river access locations on the Colorado River; one in
Columbus in Colorado County and one in La Grange. The purpose of the survey was two-fold. First,
TARL sought to

Record any archaeological sites and assess the potential impact to them from the construction of park
facilities associated with the river access points. To aid in the investigation, TARL employed a geologist
to investigate the Quaternary geology of the Colorado River channel, the purpose of which was to
potentially increase the ability of archaeologists to define areas of high probability for buried prehistoric
461

cultural resources with better precision. As mentioned, the only sites recorded in La Grange were
41FY519 and 41FY520.
Site 41FY520 is a small historic Jewish cemetery, with burials ranging from the 1860s to the 1930s. This
site is located 100 m west of the 2016 project and is just outside White Rock Parkâs western boundary.
This site is not affected by the 2016 project and will not be discussed further.
Site 41FY519, is a 60 m by 60 m open campsite buried 165 cm to 200 cm below the surface. According
to the report (Caran et al 1992), cultural material was observed in three of six backhoe trenches
excavated. The negative trenches defined the east, north, and west site boundaries, while the Colorado
River defined the south boundary. Reported material observed in the backhoe trenches included burned
rock, burned chert, imported rock and shell, and mussel shell. Trench No. 1 had the highest amount of
material observed, as well as one possible hearth feature. No time diagnostic artifacts were observed but a
soil sample was taken from Trench No. 1 and the organic fraction was radiocarbon dated to
approximately 3000 years before the present. Geological investigations determined the site to lie on a
slightly raised ridge or levee situated on the first terrace of the river. A second terrace was observed
approximately 600 m north of site 41FY519. The 1992 investigations recommended site 41FY519 remain
of undetermined eligibility for both the National Register of Historic Places and for formal designation as
a State Antiquities Landmark.
Since the currently proposed project area had not been trenched or shovel tested during the 1992 survey,
and because it lies immediately north of the site 41FY519, LCRA Cultural Resources staff decided to
monitor all earth moving tasks associated with park light installation at White Rock Park. Given the depth
of the previous finds at 165 cm to 200 cm below the surface, LCRA Cultural Resources staff deemed the
augering of the holes for the placement of the light pole structures to have the highest potential to expose
buried cultural materials, especially at the southwest pole location, which is nearest the 1992 excavations.
LCRA Cultural Resources staff monitored all excavation activities during this project. Staff monitored the
excavation of the entire electrical conduit line trench for cultural materials. Because the trenching was
conducted with a ditch-witch machine, it was not physically possible for the staff to enter the trenches.
However, samples of the trench back dirt were screened through Â¼ inch mesh screen at approximately 20
m intervals and whenever staff observed possible cultural material. Additionally, staff cleaned and
recorded seven measured soil profiles along the course of the trench monitoring. Profiles #1 and 2 at the
south end of the park closest to the current river channel showed a sandy A horizon topsoil similar but not
as thick as that on the levee feature where site 41FY519 was previously found. Profile #2, which was the
closest to the boundary of 41FY519, had a 55 cm thick sandy topsoil above a sandy clay (Figure 3).
Further east and northward, Profiles #3-8 had clay loam topsoil that is dissimilar to soil profile where
41FY519 occurred. Staff did not monitor the horizontal boring under the park road because the bit
pushed the earth aside rather than removing it. As a result, there was no excavated earth to screen.
One unifacial expedient tool fragment and a small amount of possible burned rock were observed in the
trench back dirt nearest site 41FY519. No other cultural materials were observed nor were there any
indications of a definable cultural zone in the trench wall.

462

Figure 3. Soil Profiles #2 and 7.

463

Finally, staff monitored the augering of deep holes for the four light poles. The holes were approximately
1 meter (3 ft) in diameter and 4.3 meters (14.3 ft) deep and were excavated in levels of 60 cm or less.
Staff measured the depth of each level, screened samples (approximately one 5 gallon bucket) from each
level through Â¼ inch mesh screen, and created a soil profile of each auger hole using the samples from
each level. At depths greater than the previously dug ditch witch trenches, the soil profiles of the auger
holes had clay or clay loam, to a depth of 1.5 m to 3 m below surface, overlaying sand and rounded river
gravel, which became coarser and larger as the depth increased. These deep profiles exhibited generally
well sorted sediments, fining upwards from large gravel to sand to silt and clay, as is expected of an
aggrading alluvial terrace. No cultural materials were observed.
In summary, the installation of lights for the playing fields at White Rock Park in La Grange, Fayette
County, involved the excavation of deep augured holes for the light poles and the excavation of a shallow,
narrow trench to run electrical conduits to the poles from an electrical junction 200 m to the north. LCRA
Cultural Resources staff monitored all earth excavation activities due to the close proximity of site
41FY519 and the high potential for cultural resources on this deep alluvial terrace of the Colorado River.
Observed cultural materials consisted solely of one unifacial tool fragment and a small amount of possible
burned rock near the previously recorded site. LCRA Cultural Resources staff also used the opportunity to
observe the deeper geology of the alluvial terrace.
Although no new sites were recorded during the 2016 project, the alluvial terrace upon which White Rock
Park is located retains the potential for significant, deeply buried, stratified sites, which could have a very
high research potential. LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends the eligibility of site 41FY519 for
both the National Register of Historic Places and for formal designation as a State Antiquities Landmark
remain undetermined. LCRA Cultural Resources staff also recommends any future ground disturbing
activities conducted in White Rock Park should be assessed for cultural resources.

Project 24.16 Monitoring of exploratory trenching for electrical lines at the Lane City vertical
pump station
County: Wharton
Type of Investigation: Construction Monitoring
Date of Investigation(s): June 13th and October 17th, 2016
During Cultural Resource investigations for the LCRAâs Lower Basin Reservoir Project at Lane City
(Prikryl et al 2014), a historic vertical irrigation pump plant site, site 41WH119, was tested in areas of
anticipated work for the reservoir project (Figure 212). The Pump plant site is considered to be of
unknown potential for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) due to its important role
in the start of rice farming in the area. Areas tested for the reservoir project were considered ineligible for
NRHP listing, although the rest of the site, including a 1928 pump building, a 1949 pump building, and
remains of the southern wall of a 1901 pump building exposed on the bank, is still considered to have
unknown eligibility. Recent construction plans include the digging of trenches for new electrical lines in
areas of the irrigation pump station not previously investigated with subsurface testing.
On June 13th, 2016, LCRA Cultural Resources staff monitored two exploratory trenches being dug in an
effort to locate the existing underground utility lines in between the two existing pump buildings (Figure
213). The method used, dubbed âpotholing,â involved probing the ground with a shovel to a depth of
about 1ft, then allowing a small excavator to scrape away a larger area to the same depth. This method is
repeated until the desired depth is met. Two such trenches were monitored because of their location in
untested and potentially significant areas. Trench 1 was excavated in between the 1949 pump house and
the 1928 pump house (Figure 214). The total depth of the trench was 121cmbs (centimeters below
surface). A total of 7 bricks and brick fragments of varying color and size, 1 heavily burned brick
fragment, a 10cm x 23cm cast iron metal fragment, a square headed bolt approximately 3.5in long, and 2
nails approximately 60D were observed. The hole showed a profile of about 40cm of very dark grey clay,
followed by a 10cm layer of light yellowish brown sand, a 50cm layer of very dark grey clay with
multicolored mottling, and more light yellowish brown sand below that.
Trench 2 was excavated in between the modern pump building and the Colorado River, and reached a
depth of 127cmbs, with no cultural materials observed. It contained a similar soil profile, with 20cm of
very dark brown clay loam, followed by 17cm layer of dark yellowish brown sandy clay loam, 14cm of
yellowish brown sandy loam and sand, and the same very dark grey clay with multicolored mottling
below that. It should be noted that the pump buildings all housed vertical pumps, requiring deep subfloors
where pumps are/were located. Given the location of the original 1901 pump building in between and
underneath the two standing structures, observed soils are understandably heavily disturbed and likely
partially made up of foreign materials. None of the materials observed are considered significant, and no
remnants of the 1901 building foundation were located.

465

On October 17th, 2016, staff returned to monitor the excavation of trenches to run new electrical lines to
the 1949 pump building and the 1970âs storage building adjacent to the two pump houses (Figure 213).
These trenches were dug to an average depth of 95cm, as the electrical lines were to be laid at a target
depth of 3ft. Trench 3 was excavated from an electrical junction box to the end of a buried concrete âduct
bankâ. Around 15 bricks and brick fragments were observed, including a small cluster of 6 bricks around
55cmbs, though these appeared jumbled and lacked mortar (Figure 215). Three chunks of bricks mortared
together were observed in this trench, but all three were isolated and from different areas and depths
within the trench. Trench 3 was terminated because of need to change the angle of the trench.
Trench 4 was excavated from the end of trench 3 to the far edge of the 1928 pump building. Trench 4
almost immediately encountered a feature of what appeared to be stacked bricks (Figure 216). Though
many of these were aligned, many were also at odd angles, and none were mortared together. Some of the
bricks had trace amounts of mortar on them, but most did not. The cluster appeared to be about 30cm
thick, 160cm long, and of unknown width, though the deposit seemed to run most of the width of the
trench, but did not continue into the north wall of the trench. The bricks were surrounded and mixed in
with a layer of brown sand. The typical profile for Trench 4 was 30 to 45cm of brown silt and foreign
gravel (from the dirt road above the trench), 20 to 25cm of brown clay, and approximately 45cm of very
dark brown clay with mottling. The brick layer with sand appears in between the brown clay and very
dark brown clay. Approximately 50-80 more bricks and brick fragments of varying color and texture were
observed either alone or in small groupings of 2-3 bricks throughout the rest of the trench.
Trench 5 was excavated from the rear corner of the 1970âs metal storage building to the electrical
junction box where Trench 3 had begun. This trench encountered bricks throughout and with a similar
density to that observed in Trench 4, with around 50-100 brick observed in backdirt piles and side walls.
Trench 5 also encountered a feature similar to the one encountered in Trench 4 (Figure 217). This cluster
of bricks was about 110cm long, 30cm thick, and extended across most of the trench without entering the
opposing wall. The bricks again appeared to be stacked, however no mortar or mortar residue was
observed on any of them. Once again the cluster was surrounded by a brown sand, and had a 45cm brown
clay layer above and a very dark brown to dark gray clay with mottling below.
One explanation for the clusters observed during the monitoring is that the high quantity of bricks,
lacking traces of mortar, represents fill material. The original pump building would presumably have had
a significant subfloor like those of the buildings that succeeded it, and the canal head and canal route have
changed to reflect the pump building location since the switch to the 1949 pump building. Both the 1901
building and the old canal would have left sizable voids in the ground surface, and the brick may
represent part of the fill used to level the surface out. None of the bricks in the cluster resembled a wall or
foundation, as they lacked mortar, faced the wrong directions, and did not span the complete distance of
the trench. The trenches excavated should have encountered the subsurface portions of the 1901 building
if any existed north of the portions exposed on the river bank, and as none were encountered, it must be
assumed that these portions of the walls and foundation of the 1901 building are either not intact or
potentially no longer present.
No archaeologically significant materials were observed during the monitoring of trenching at 41WH119,
the Lane City Pump Plant. The two brick cluster features are considered to be likely fill material, and
466

while their origin is unknown, they do not represent part of the architecture of the 1901 pump building.
This Project is considered complete.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Natural Resource Conservation (NRC) department
completed vegetation management work on seven LCRA properties on Lakes Buchanan and Travis
between December 2016 and March 2017 (Figure 218). Due to a compressed window of work and the
long history of brush clearing surveys on these properties, a series of file searches, short resurveys, and
monitoring of the clearing work was conducted. A total of approximately 849 acres were cleared as a part
of FY17 vegetation management. All file searches, short resurvey data, and monitoring data are recorded
within this monitoring report. Because the majority of planning and start of work fell in 2016, and
because the majority of work was completed by the time LCRA staff began compiling the 2016 Annual
Report of Investigations, this project is treated as a 2016 project.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Many of the LCRA owned properties along Lakes Buchanan and Travis have been subjected to multiple
cultural resource surveys for the specific purpose of brush clearing. This began with TAC permit 157,
which was used from 1978 to 1979 to conduct brush clearing, boundary fence, and other lands
management type surveys across LCRA lands (Table 24). LCRA internal project files are not well
indexed from 1989 to 2000, though it is not believed that much, if any, work was conducted by LCRA
Cultural Resources for the purpose of brush clearing during that time. An extensive effort was made by
Staff Archaeologist Bruce Nightengale during portions of that period to inventory the Lake Buchanan and
Lake Travis lands. All of the affected properties were included in those inventory efforts.
During the following 16 years, in which LCRA Cultural Resource files are well-indexed, many surveys
have been conducted in advance of vegetation management efforts. The table below lists them by their
LCRA project number (Table 24).

METHODOLOGY
This monitoring regime was designed to allow LCRA NRC staff and contractors to clear overgrown areas
of the seven properties concerned within a highly restrictive schedule. In most cases, much of the clearing
area was either along existing roads or fire breaks which had been cleared multiple times in the past, or
had otherwise been cleared in prior years, and had reverted to an overgrown state. Often in these areas,
despite dense vegetation, signs of prior clearing, such as thick mulch or brush piles, were visible.
An intensive file search was first conducted on each property in order to determine what areas had already
been surveyed for brush clearing, and what sites would fall into FY17 clearing areas. Sites with either
unknown or eligible SAL status (as per Texas Historical Commission [THC] determinations listed on the
online Archeological Sites Atlas) were restricted to hand clearing methods only, or at least where the
unknown or eligible component was located within the site. Sites with ineligible SAL status (again, as per
the THC) were evaluated to determine what level of protection was warranted, based on current site
condition and depth. Sites without formal eligibility determinations from the THC were treated as having
unknown eligibility, and were thus restricted to hand clearing methods. There were no SAL-listed sites
within the clearing areas. Contractors and NRC staff were also asked to take care to avoid isolated historic
features present on the properties, such as picket fence segments, and any potentially undiscovered
historic features.
Areas considered to be under-surveyed were re-examined. This consisted of pedestrian survey, and in the
case of Double Horn North, shovel testing of a small area. Once staff had determined what areas would be
suitable to be cleared by what methods, flagging was hung in short intervals around the areas in question.
On some of these flagging trips, NRC staff, and on one occasion a contractor, accompanied the Cultural
Resources team in order to gain a comprehensive knowledge of both flagging locations and restrictions.
In all cases, prior to the start of work, clearing crews and their supervisors were briefed on cultural
resources and the flagging hung at the particular property, along with other environmental and water
quality restrictions.
The majority of work conducted was completed by contractors, though NRC staff also completed some
work with in-house staff and equipment. The equipment types and methods of use utilized during FY17
vegetation management activities, as well as their impact to soil and archaeological sites, are addressed
below.
Hand Clearing
Hand clearing methods were allowed at nearly any location on the properties, but because of the time and
expense associated with this method, it was often not used. Areas designated as hand clearing only were
often left alone entirely, but were sometimes cleared. The method involves manually cutting brush and
trees with chainsaws and machetes. Some of the contractors would mulch vegetation removed using this
method, while some would stack and burn the resulting brush. In both cases, it was made clear to hand
clearing crews that neither mulching nor burning could be done within these hand clearing zones; brush
needed to be removed from these areas by hand, and burned or mulched in areas designated for Seppi

476

mulching or bulldozing. Often hand clearing crews only cleared understory or fresh growth in previously
cleared areas and firebreaks and roads.
Seppi
Seppi is a brand of brush clearing and mulching equipment, but the term has become the vernacular for a
variety of brands of similar machines of varying sizes. Here, and to the crews working during the FY17
vegetation management project, a Seppi refers to a large tractor type machine with a boom and attachment
(Figure 219). The attachments vary somewhat, but consist of either chains or metal disk blades that rotate
at high velocities, and effectively shred anything with which they come into contact. This machine is
effective at destroying brushy vegetation and mulching it at the same time, with relatively little impact to
soil surface. The only negative impacts of the machine on archaeology consist of the soil disturbance
from the machineâs large tires and weight, and the layer of mulch laid down, which effectively eliminates
surface visibility until the material decomposes. The mulch does help prevent return of brushy vegetation,
and reduces the impact of the heavy machines; but some minor soil disturbance nonetheless occurs with
use of these machines. The depth of this disturbance is estimated at 1-6 inches, depending on soil
conditions and weather. For this reason, they were restricted from use in most sites of unknown or eligible
SAL status, and sites lacking formal determinations. Known sites that were deeply buried, such as those
at the south side of Shaffer Bend, were subjected to Seppi work, as the deposits would not be disturbed by
the machinesâ minor soil disturbance.

Figure 219. A Seppi type machine working at Gloster Bend. Note the resulting mulch in the foreground.

477

Skid Steer
LCRA and its contractors have frequently used skid steers for vegetation management. They are highly
versatile, and have a variety of attachments available. In the past, these attachments have often been small
Seppi flail mulcher attachments. For FY17 vegetation management, the skid steers being used had shear
attachments, which, as the name suggests, are like large hydraulic scissors for cutting vegetation at its
base. While these machines are lighter and more versatile than the large Seppiâs, their signature skid
turning method can cause disturbance of around 1-6 inches. In areas where Seppi work was allowed, skid
steer work was also allowed, and vice versa.
Bulldozing
While bulldozers are commonly known to generate massive disturbances, LCRA Cultural Resources staff
have observed several bulldozers in action on LCRA lands, and have found that disturbances can be
minimized with the right practices. The practice commonly used by NRC and their contractors is called
grubbing. Rather than using the width of the blade to push trees over, moving large amounts of soil, the
operator uses the corner of the blade to first penetrate below the base of the tree, and then force it upward
and out of the ground. Smaller brush is still pushed out of the ground using the blades full width, and the
loose brush is then corralled into wind rows, or long rows of brush along the exterior of the clearing area.
When an area is finished, these rows of brush are usually pushed back into a more central portion of the
clearing area and burned (Figure 220). The burning process can create enough heat to generate burned
rock, and thus the area where brush is burned is confined to bulldozing areas. Bulldozing was not allowed
on any sites with unknown or eligible SAL status, or sites lacking SAL determinations. Further, only a
handful of the ineligible prehistoric sites, and none of the known unmitigated features of the historic sites,
were exposed to bulldozing. Despite better practices, bulldozers still commonly disturb soils down to
about 6 inches to 1 foot (ft), and in wet conditions or on loose substrate, much deeper.

478

Figure 220. A section of Muleshoe Bend cleared by bulldozer. Note the burn pile in the middle left, and bulldozer in
the distant right.

The end goal of the clearing is to remove dense brushy vegetation and non-native species of vegetation, in
order to return these areas to a more natural state. The intention of the NRC department is to maintain
these cleared areas with low impact methods, such as prescribed burns, in order to prevent their
overgrowth in the future.

RESULTS
LCRA NRC coordinated work on seven LCRA properties: Canyon of the Eagles, Cedar Point, Shaffer
Bend, Double Horn, Gloster Bend, Grelle, and Muleshoe Bend. The cultural resources work and
restrictions, and vegetation management methods employed at each of these properties is described
below.

Canyon of the Eagles
Canyon of the Eagles is an LCRA park property located on the northeastern side of Lake Buchanan
(Figure 222). The area in which vegetation management took place was cleared via a file search. The area
in question had been well surveyed by a 1996 inventory effort (Kotter et al 1996), and contains no known
archaeological sites. The work on this small 31.2-acre area will be conducted by NRC staff, and utilize
bulldozing, a skid steer with a shear, and a combination of shredding and burning to dispose of materials.
This work will not be monitored due to the extent of prior investigation. Emergency discovery procedures
will be in effect.

Cedar Point
Cedar Point is an LCRA park property located on the northwestern side of Lake Buchanan (Figure 223).
All but 27.3 acres of the 110.3 acres proposed for clearing had survey reports that could be located. The
small area which was not clearly surveyed was subjected to pedestrian survey on December 6th, 2016.
Soils appeared shallow, and there was plentiful evidence of prior brush shredding present. Based on this
survey, it was determined that Seppi use would be acceptable, as they would cause no more damage than
had already been done during past brush clearing. No archaeological material was observed during the
pedestrian survey. The only vegetation management methods used at Cedar Point were Seppis and hand
clearing crews. Fencing was replaced along existing fence corridors along some parts of the park
boundary.

Shaffer Bend
Shaffer Bend is an LCRA park property on the north side of Lake Travis (Figure 224). The entirety of the
vegetation management area is considered to have been previously surveyed. Three sites, 41BT428,
41BT451, and 41BT483, have buried deposits felt to be at risk from bulldozing, and thus were restricted
to skid steer work and hand clearing. Sites 41BT49, 41BT67, and a small portion of the strip of 41BT70
being cleared are considered at risk from any type of mechanical clearing, and were restricted to hand
clearing only. Site 41BT361, a lithic scatter determined by the THC to be ineligible for SAL listing, is
buried between 30 centimeters below surface (cm bs) and 170 cmbs, and consists of chert debitage with
no features. It is felt to neither be at risk for damage from bulldozing, or warranting protection, and thus
no restrictions were placed within the site. A total of 210.8 acres of land were cleared at Shaffer Bend.

480

Double Horn
Double Horn is an LCRA property located on the south side of Lake Travis (Figure 225). Brush
management work for the south side of Double Horn Creek was surveyed and approved in LCRA report
25.15, but was not completed. As such, the work was completed as part of the FY17 vegetation
management plan. Work in this area was monitored, specifically to help guide bulldozers along the
boundaries of areas restricted to bulldozing. The portion of 41BT170 and all of 41BT172 will also be
subjected to skid steer work for those areas that were approved in the 2015 report.
Double Horn north only had a 10.9-acre area proposed for clearing (Figure 226). This area had been
surveyed as part of an inventory survey in the winter of 1999-2000, though the extent of the survey was
unclear in field notes from the time. As such, a 6-acre portion of the 10 acres that was in question was
resurveyed on December 28th, 2016. Thirteen shovel tests were placed within the 6-acre area, and located
a small and seemingly sparse buried lithic scatter, recorded as 41BT517. Two positive shovel tests located
the site, and the boundary of the site was subsequently drawn to reflect the possible area of deposits, as
some areas were inaccessible from the thickness of the brush. Work was then monitored, as several passes
of the bulldozer were watched, including a path along 41BT517âs boundary. As the bulldozer passed
along the siteâs southern end, clearing the terrace edge while archaeologists were present, four pieces of
burned rock were exposed. Subsequently, two more shovel tests were excavated closer to the terrace edge,
and both were terminated at over a meter (m) due to manual testing limits. The terrace is composed of
sandy loam, and appears to be over 1.35 m deep. Both tests were negative, but the possibility of deeply
buried deposits seems high. The burned rocks were exposed near the opening to the burrow of some kind
(likely a small to medium mammal based on the holes), and may have been brought up from below by
these burrowing activities. While 41BT517 was treated as having undetermined SAL status during work
because it lacked a THC eligibility determination, it is also now recommended as being of undetermined
SAL eligibility by LCRA Cultural Resources staff, and would require deep testing methods to determine
anything more.
Once brush had been pushed into piles by the bulldozers, the âwind rowsâ were surveyed again to ensure
that no unknown archaeological material had surfaced during clearing, and to prevent such unknown
deposits from being exposed to the brush burning. Nothing was located, and burning was allowed to
proceed.
Between Double Hornsâs northern and southern portions, a total of approximately 73 acres were cleared
as a part of the FY17 vegetation management work.
Gloster Bend
Gloster Bend is an LCRA park property located on the north side of Lake Travis (Figure 227). The crew
working at Gloster Bend only used Seppis and hand clearing crews. Most of the areas being cleared had
been previously cleared, consisting of fire breaks and road corridors. The Seppi machines were allowed to
work up to 15 ft from the roadway within 41BT475, beyond which crews hand cleared brush and
removed it to the Seppi area for shredding. This is because prior clearing had been completed in that 15-ft
corridor several times, and it was felt that the Seppis would not further damage the small corridor.
481

Portions of sites 41TV481, 41TV482, and 41TV2273 were flagged and marked as hand clearing only
areas, because of historic features at the sites. 41TV2278 was also marked as hand clearing only within
the clearing zone, due to prehistoric deposits of undetermined eligibility. All of these sites were given a
brief resurvey during flagging on November 3rd, and the work areas were monitored twice in the course of
work to ensure restrictions were being followed. No issues were observed, and no new material was
discovered during the work. A total of approximately 133 acres were cleared.

Grelle
The Grelle Recreation Area is an LCRA park property located on the south side of Lake Travis (Figure
228). The work crews at Grelle included Seppiâs and hand clearing crews. Much of the clearing area at
Grelle consisted of previously maintained road corridors and fire breaks, as well as areas that had been
cleared in the past. The only sites of concern at Grelle were 41BT158 and 41BT159. Site 41BT158, a
small historic foundation, was easily relocated and flagged for hand clearing only. Site 41BT159, which
in internal LCRA GIS files is mapped as extending much further than on the THCâs Online Archeological
Sites Atlas, was resurveyed via pedestrian survey before clearing. Areas of the site that were deflated were
cleared for Seppi work, while areas with soil were flagged for hand clearing. Both sites were revisited
after clearing was completed, and removal of vegetation within the hand clearing zone revealed several
more historic foundation features, as well as more prehistoric material. A site revisit form was filed for
both sites, and the current boundaries updated with TARL to reflect their current known extent.
Two sites, 41BT53 and 41BT54, are shown on the Archeological Sits Atlas as being within the current
project area. Both of these sites were removed from their location within the LCRA internal GIS database,
after a review of the 41BT53 site form and surveys of the area revealed that they could not be where they
are mapped. These sites are both supposed to be below the lake level, and are mapped as on a slope where
no sign of them exists. In the case of 41BT53, it is believed by staff that the site could have been a portion
of 41BT1, mistakenly identified in the 1962 survey and excavation. Site 41BT54 has no listed site form,
but is mentioned in the 41BT53 site form as being 100 yards east of 41BT53. The fence line described in
the site form is unknown to LCRA staff as well. A brief consultation with TARL recovered another
sketch map not listed on the THCâs Archeological Sites Atlas, and which would indicate that the sites are
actually south of Grelle on the Pedernales River. TARLâs physical topographic site maps show the two
sites on the side of the peninsula at Grelle, but farther into the channel and not on the peninsula itself.
LCRA staff will make an effort to locate these sites at Grelle during the next major drop in lake levels,
but it is suspected that they are not within the cove where they are mapped at TARL, and possibly not on
LCRA property at all.
Work was visited and monitored twice during the clearing. A total 85.5 acres were cleared.

Muleshoe Bend
Muleshoe Bend is an LCRA park property located on the south side of Lake Travis (Figure 229). The
work crew at Muleshoe consisted of two bulldozers. Sites 41TV496, 41TV501, and 41TV1779 were
flagged for hand clearing only. Sites 41TV499, 41TV505, and 41TV507 all had discrete historic features
within them that were flagged for hand clearing. A cistern at 41TV507, and one of two cisterns at
41TV499, were not flagged for protection, as they had been previously removed and mitigated, and all
that remains of them is portions of the bottom of the collars (Hixson 2008). Sites 41BT347, 41TV 498,
41TV500, 41TV502, and 41TV2291 are all lithic scatters considered ineligible for SAL listing. Site
41TV498 also has a historic component, consisting primarily of a couple of dressed limestone
foundations, two trash scatters, and some ranching features; however, these have been determined
ineligible, and are considered by Cultural Resources staff to be disturbed and lacking integrity at this
point, as a result of prior, less well controlled, brush clearing events. Site 41BT147, which is listed on the
Archeological Sites Atlas as undetermined, was cleared for bulldozing because it is considered destroyed.
The site is suspected to extend beyond LCRA property, and any portions beyond the known may still be
intact; however, the portion on LCRA property was destroyed by an emergency bladed fire break installed
some time before 1997 (Malof et al. 2016). Work was monitored at Muleshoe Bend during three separate
trips to ensure that bulldozers remained outside of flagged areas. A more comprehensive post clearing
survey is planned to assess any newly exposed cultural resources, though Muleshoe Bend is considered
one of the best surveyed of all LCRA lands. A total of approximately 205 acres were cleared.

SUMMARY
Through a series of in-depth file searches, short resurveys, and monitoring of clearing activates, LCRA
Cultural Resources staff have allowed the LCRAâs NRC department and their vendors to clear 849 acres
of LCRA park land and resource area, using a variety of methods. Clearing was conducted from
December, 2016 to March, 2017. This project has helped enable the NRC department in furthering their
goal of responsible land management, while ensuring appropriate avoidance of cultural resource sites.
NRC staff plan to maintain the areas cleared in recent years using regular and low impact methods, such
as prescribed burns, in order to prevent the need for intensive clearing such as this in these areas in the
future.
A resurvey of select portions of cleared areas will be conducted over the next several months, in order to
locate and assess any undiscovered sites exposed by clearing. Sites where a significant change was noted
during work, such as an expansion of the site or change in the state of the site, will have revisit forms
submitted to TARL. No SAL-eligible sites or sites of undetermined eligibility were adversely affected as
a result of the brush clearing work discussed in this report.
