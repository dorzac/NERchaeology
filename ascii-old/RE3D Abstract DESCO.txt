Abstract: On February 8th and 9th, 2005, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. of Houston, Texas, conducted a visual reconnaissance and pedestrian
survey of the proposed right-of-way expansion of Genoa-Red Bluff Road in eastern Harris County, Texas. The project corridor covers 2.14 miles of the
length of the existing Genoa-Red Bluff Road, with variable widths of proposed widening on varying sides of said ROW. The Project Area is located on
both the 1982 USGS Pasadena and LaPorte, Texas topographic quadrangles. Thirteen shovel tests were manually excavated during the investigation. The
work was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No.3608 for the Harris County Public Infrastructure Department. No previously recorded sites exist
within the Project Area, and no cultural materials or deposits were encountered during survey. Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. thus concludes that
no additional archeological investigation is necessary prior to the proposed right-of-way expansion project.
