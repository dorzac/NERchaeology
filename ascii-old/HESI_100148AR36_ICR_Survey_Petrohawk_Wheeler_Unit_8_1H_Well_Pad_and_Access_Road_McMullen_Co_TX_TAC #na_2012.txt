ABSTRACT

On 30 December 2011, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of Petrohawk Energy Corporation’s (PEC) proposed
Wheeler Unit 8 1H well pad and access road right-of-way (ROW) in east-central McMullen
County, Texas (Project Area). The proposed well pad measures approximately 500.0 by 500.0
feet (152.4 by 152.4 meters [m]), with a total area of 5.7 acres. The proposed access road
ROW measures approximately 11,000.0 feet (3352.8 m) long and 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide, with
a total area of 12.6 acres. Overall, the Project Area totals 18.3 acres. Although the Project
Area will be located entirely on private property and will be constructed with private funds, its
construction will require coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA). As a result, the portions of the undertaking within FEMA’s purview also fall under the
regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of
PEC in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine
if the construction of the proposed well pad and access road within areas under the purview of
FEMA had the potential to have an adverse impact on any significant cultural resources
considered to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new prehistoric site.
Site 41MC584 was documented as a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter situated on the
southeastern slope of an upland landform between 2 tributaries of the Nueces River. Based on
the presence of only shallow cultural deposits, the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, the
lack of any observed cultural features, and the lack of preserved floral and faunal materials, site
41MC584 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Aside from 41MC584, no
other cultural resources were documented within the areas under the purview of FEMA within
the Project Area.
Based on the assessment that site 41MC584 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion
on the NRHP, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed Wheeler Unit 8 1H
well pad and access road will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources within
areas under the purview of FEMA. Horizon therefore recommends that PEC be allowed to
proceed with the construction of the proposed well pad and access road, relative to the
jurisdiction of FEMA and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at

any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed well pad and
access road, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and FEMA should be notified of
the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of Petrohawk
Energy Corporation’s (PEC) proposed Wheeler Unit 8 1H well pad and access road right-of-way
(ROW) in east-central McMullen County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The
proposed well pad measures approximately 500.0 by 500.0 feet (152.4 by 152.4 meters [m]),
with a total area of 5.7 acres. The proposed access road ROW measures approximately
11,000.0 feet (3352.8 m) in length and 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide, with a total area of 12.6 acres.
Overall, the Project Area totals 18.3 acres. Although the Project Area will be located entirely on
private property and will be constructed with private funds, its construction will require
coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). As a result, the
portions of the undertaking under FEMA’s purview also fall under the regulations of Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon conducted the
cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of PEC in compliance with Section 106
of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if the construction of the proposed
well pad and access road within areas under the purview of FEMA had the potential to have an
adverse impact on any significant cultural resources considered to be eligible for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the portions of the Project Area within FEMA’s purview, and the
production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure,
Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural
Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director)
served as the project’s Principal Investigator, while Jared Wiersema (Horizon staff archeologist)
and Michael Placher conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 30 December 2011. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts within the boundaries of the
proposed well pad and access road ROW. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres for projects measuring
between 11.0 and 100.0 acres in size. As such, a minimum of 9 to 10 shovel tests were
necessary within the 18.3-acre Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 26 shovel tests within the Project Area. These

tests were concentrated within areas under the purview of FEMA within the Project Area, which
included the majority of the proposed well pad and roughly the eastern half of the proposed
access road.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new prehistoric site.
Site 41MC584 was documented as a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter situated on the
southeastern slope of an upland landform between 2 tributaries of the Nueces River. Although
this site’s boundaries extended beyond the limits of the proposed well pad, the field crew
assessed the entire extent of the site in order to fully determine its overall NRHP eligibility
status. Based on the presence of only shallow cultural deposits, the lack of temporally
diagnostic artifacts, the lack of any observed cultural features, and the lack of preserved floral
and faunal materials, site 41MC584 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
Aside from 41MC584, no other cultural resources were documented within the areas under the
purview of FEMA within the Project Area.
Based on the assessment that site 41MC584 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion
on the NRHP, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed Wheeler Unit 8 1H
well pad and access road will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources within
areas under the purview of FEMA. Horizon therefore recommends that PEC be allowed to
proceed with the construction of the proposed well pad and access road, relative to the
jurisdiction of FEMA and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed well pad and
access road, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately and the THC and FEMA should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

PEC’s proposed Wheeler Unit 8 1H well pad and access road ROW are located in eastcentral McMullen County, approximately 9.5 miles (15.4 km) southeast of Tilden, Texas (see
Figures 1-1 and 1-2). They can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute San
Caja Hill, Texas, topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 1-1). The proposed well pad
measures approximately 500.0 by 500.0 feet (152.4 by 152.4 m), with a total area of 5.7 acres.
It is located on the southeastern slope of a chaparral-covered landform situated between 2
tributaries of the Nueces River. The proposed access road ROW measures approximately
11,000.0 feet (3352.8 m) long and 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide, with a total area of 12.6 acres. It
initiates from County Road (CR) 1106 and extends along existing 2-track dirt roads to the
northwest corner of the proposed well pad. Overall, the Project Area totals 18.3 acres.
Representative images of the Project Area at the time of the cultural resource survey are
presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in east-central McMullen County in South Texas. The
proposed well pad is located on the southeastern slope of a landform between 2 tributaries of
the Nueces River, while the proposed access road extends eastward from Dragoon Hollow,
crossing several tributaries of the Nueces River along its course. The entire Project Area is
situated in an area of slightly undulating hills within an area of chaparral typical of South Texas.
Elevations within the Project Area range between approximately 170.0 feet (51.8 m) and 220.0
feet (67.1 m) above mean sea level. Hydrologically, the proposed ROW is situated within the
Nueces River basin. The entire Project Area is generally drained to the south into the Nueces
River, located approximately 1.2 miles (1.9 km) to the south, via several of its tributaries.

2.3

CLIMATE

The climate in McMullen County is generally mild in the winter, with an average
temperature of 55.5 degrees. In the summer months, the average temperature is 84.7 degrees,
with an average daily maximum temperature of 97.2 degrees. The average annual total
precipitation is about 23.42 inches. Of this, about 21.08 inches, or 90%, usually fall in February
through November. Thunderstorms occur on about 37 days each year, with most occurring in
May (NRCS 2011).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is located in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province (WWF 2005) and the
South Texas Plains vegetational region (Gould 1975). The upland areas support a rich tapestry
of south Texas chaparral. The vegetation of the undeveloped and uncleared areas can be
characterized as brush country, with variably dense scrub ranging in height from 4.0 to 10.0
feet. Mesquite and associated thorny shrubs, such as catclaw acacia, huisache, blackbrush,
granjeno, whitebrush, prickly pear, and Spanish dagger are common locally. Understory
vegetation is characteristically sparse. Along major drainages, live oak, Texas sugarberry,
cedar elm, and retama occur. Little bluestem, bristlegrass, paspalums, windmill grass, and
buffelgrass are dominant grasses.
The Tamaulipan/Mezquital ecoregion of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico has
unique plant and animal communities containing tree- and brush-covered dunes, wind tidal flats,
and dense native brushland (WWF 2005). Although there are large acreages of cultivated land
on the South Texas Plains, most of the area is still rangeland. Land holdings predominantly are

large cattle ranches. Deer and other wildlife species are common. This area originally
supported a grassland- or savannah-type climax vegetation. Long continued grazing and other
factors have altered the plant communities to such a degree that ranchmen of the region now
face a severe brush problem (Gould 1975).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The prehistory of South Texas can essentially be divided into 3 major periods: (1)
Paleoindian (9200–6000 BC); (2) Archaic, which has been subdivided into the Early Archaic (ca.
6000–2500 BC), Middle Archaic (ca. 2500–400 BC), and Late Archaic (ca. 400 BC–AD 800);
and (3) Late Prehistoric (AD 800–1600). These prehistoric periods are principally defined by the
presence of particular diagnostic projectile points, but they are intended to designate general
cultural patterns based on ecology, technology, and subsistence strategies (Black 1989:48-57;
Suhm et al. 1954).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9200–6000 BC)

Evidence of Paleoindian occupations in South Texas (9200–6000 BC) usually consists
of surface finds found most frequently in the Nueces-Guadalupe and Rio Grande plains. Only 2
stratified Paleoindian sites have been excavated in the region: Buckner Ranch (Sellards 1940)
and Berger Bluff (Brown 1987). Both sites were deeply buried in alluvial terraces. Diagnostic
projectile point styles of the Paleoindian period include Clovis (Meltzer 1986), Folsom (Largent
et al. 1991), Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura (Black 1989:48-49). Finely flaked end
scrapers fashioned on blades and bifacially worked Clear Fork tools are also diagnostic of the
Paleoindian period. Paleoindian peoples have traditionally been characterized as terminal
Pleistocene big-game hunters, but these highly mobile hunter-gatherers probably exploited a
rich diversity of wild plant and animal foods. Investigations at Baker Cave, for instance, indicate
that a diverse array of fish, snakes, and rodents was exploited by the Paleoindian occupants
(Hester 1983). Paleoindian populations were probably organized into small groups that ranged
over great distances across periglacial plains and marginally forested areas to acquire different
food sources throughout the year (Black 1989:48).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6000 BC–AD 800)

The major distinction of the Early Archaic period (6000–2500 BC) is the replacement of
earlier lanceolate-shaped projectile points by stemmed and corner-notched types. These styles
include Bell, Andice, Early Triangular, and Early Expanding Stemmed points such as Bandy,
Martindale, Uvalde, and related forms (Turner and Hester 1999). Other diagnostic artifacts
include Clear Fork tools and large, thin, triangular bifaces with concave bases. The beginning of
the Early Archaic period marks the onset of the modern Holocene era, during which the
periglacial climate of the late Pleistocene began to grow warmer. Available evidence from the

HJN 100148 AR 36

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Gulf Coastal Plain suggests that population densities remained low through the beginning of the
Archaic period in South Texas, reflecting a continuation of the highly mobile adaptations of the
Paleoindian period.
The Middle Archaic period (2500–400 BC) in South Texas is defined by the presence of
Pedernales, Langtry, Kinney, Bulverde, and Tortugas projectile point styles (Bell 1958; Turner
and Hester 1999). Distally beveled tools are also common during this period, and ground stone
tools, such as tubular grinding stones and manos, appear for the first time (Black 1989:49). Site
densities in South Texas increase markedly during the Middle Archaic, possibly reflecting a
decrease in group mobility and/or an increase in territoriality among groups (Black 1989:51). A
heavier reliance on vegetal foods may be indicated by the introduction of ground stone
technology and the appearance of large burned rock middens throughout Central Texas.
Late Archaic (400 BC–AD 800) occupations in South Texas are defined by small cornerand side­notched dart points, including Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Fairland, and Ellis types (Bell 1958,
1960; Turner and Hester 1999). Site densities continue to increase throughout the Late Archaic
period, possibly indicating that population densities continued to rise. Cultural deposits on Late
Archaic sites also tend to be deeper than during preceding periods, suggesting that occupations
were either more extended in duration or that reoccupation of the same locations was more
frequent (Black 1989:51). Cemeteries appear during this period, possibly indicating higher levels
of social organization and increasing territoriality (Black 1989:51). During the Late Archaic, the
exploitation of different ecological niches continued to intensify, becoming increasingly oriented
toward the exploitation of seasonal food sources. This kind of adaptation is best illustrated by
the frequent occurrence of shell middens along the coast and burned rock middens farther
inland. Data collected from inland sites indicate that the economy was based primarily on
vegetal resources supplemented with the hunting of small game such as rodents and rabbits
(Black 1989:51).

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 800–1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period is defined by the appearance of pottery and the
bow and arrow. The small dart points of the Late Archaic period were largely replaced by arrow
points (Black 1989:52). The Late Prehistoric period in South Texas has been divided into 2
distinct time horizons, the Austin (AD 800–1350) and Toyah (AD 1350–1600) phases (Black
1986). The Austin phase is characterized by the presence of Scallorn arrow points, while the
Toyah phase is defined by the presence of Perdiz arrow points. Faunal resources became
increasingly important during this period, especially large mammals such as bison and deer.
Lithic tool kits seem to have been manufactured for the processing of large mammals (Black
1989:51-57). Late Prehistoric sites are relatively common throughout South Texas, which might
be interpreted as the result of population increases. The movement of bison from Central to
South Texas may coincide with a movement of peoples and/or technology from both the Austin
and Toyah phases of Central Texas (Black 1989:51-57).

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 1520 TO PRESENT)

The historic era of South Texas began with the arrival of Europeans in the region and
can be subsumed within the overall history of Texas. In South Texas, the historic era has been
divided into 3 time periods: (1) Spanish Exploration and Colonial (ca. AD 1520–1821); (2)
Mexican (1821-1836); and (3) Texas-American (ca. 1836 to present). The Protohistoric era in
this region can generally be incorporated within the early part of the Spanish Exploration and
Colonial period.
Protohistoric
Records from the initial Spanish expeditions provide the earliest ethnohistoric accounts
of the Coahuiltecan-affiliated groups indigenous to the Rio Grande Plain (Hester 1989a:1-4;
1989b:77-82). Based on fragmentary ethnohistorical records, it appears that these people—part
of an extinct cultural group that occupied lands stretching from South Texas deep into Mexico—
were highly nomadic hunter­gatherers who moved in a seasonal pattern within distinctive
territories (Hester 1989a). Available evidence suggests that Coahuiltecans living in the Rio
Grande Plain (as well as in other parts of South Texas and northern Mexico) subsisted on a
number of seasonal food sources, ranging from prickly pear in the fall to bison or deer in the late
fall or winter, as well as small mammals and roots during off­seasons or in times of hardship
(Hester 1989b:77-81).
Two causes can be cited for the early destruction of the Coahuiltecan groups on the Rio
Grande plain. The primary reason stems from the great period of unrest among Native
American groups generated by the introduction of the horse by the Spanish. Groups who
adopted the horse (especially the Apache and the Comanche) eagerly took to raiding
neighboring groups. Nomadic peoples such as the Coahuiltecans were especially vulnerable to
such pressure, as they could neither consolidate for protection nor occupy defensible positions
without risking starvation. Therefore, finally, the Coahuiltecans asked for missions to be
established in their territories in order to protect them from the Apache and Comanche raiders.
After the establishment of the Spanish missions in South Texas during the first half of the 18th
century, the remnants of the indigenous Native American groups were rapidly integrated into the
mission system or were subjected to outright extinction by depredation or disease (John
1975:171-174).
Spanish Colonial
The first European incursion into Texas was by Alvarez de Pineda in 1513 during the
course of a Spanish mapping expedition. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after
being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay (Folan et al. 1989:85). Between
1688 and 1717, Spanish explorers such as Mazanet and Espinosa passed through the Rio
Grande Plain from Mexico on their way to the Caddoan settlements in northeast Texas (Hester
1989b:80-81). These early Spanish explorers recorded observations about the aboriginal
groups in the region, but they were primarily engaged in consolidating territory for the Spanish
Crown.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Following the founding of San Antonio in 1718, the town of Laredo was established
along the Rio Grande in 1755 when rancher Tomas Sanchez de la Berrera y Gallardo was
granted permission by the great Spanish colonizer, Jose de Escandon, to form a new
settlement. Located in the province of Nuevo Santander, which included most of northeastern
Mexico and parts of present-day Texas, Laredo was one of a series of settlements that
Escandon established or authorized as part of Spain’s effort to colonize the area south of the
Nueces River (Clark and Juarez 1986:85; Folan et aI. 1986:6).
Mexican and Texas-American
Prior to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, a Spanish garrison was established in Laredo
to minimize the effects of depredations by Lipan Apache and Comanche raiders. In 1790, a
daring attack on the city overran the garrison and exploded the powder magazine, deepening
fears “that the Comanches’ efforts to sweep through south Texas were succeeding” (Briggs
1982:7). Once the Texas-Mexico border was established along the Rio Grande in 1848, the role
of protection in the Laredo area passed to the United States. In 1849, a company of mounted
infantry under 2nd Lieutenant E.L. Viele arrived to establish an army post on “some high flats
west of the city, opposite a ford and just north of a bend in the Rio Grande” (Briggs 1982:7) on
the Texas side of the river about 3/4ths of a mile west of the old Spanish town of Laredo.
Originally named Camp Crawford (or Camp Laredo), the name of the post was changed in 1850
to Fort McIntosh in honor of Lieutenant Colonel James S. McIntosh, who died in September
1847 from wounds received at the Battle of Molino del Rey during the Mexican-American War
(Frazer 1972). When construction began in 1850, the general military objective of the Fort was
to provide “escort service to caravans of travelers and [to reduce] Indian depredations and
general outlawry” (Briggs 1982:8).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area. Similarly, a review of the
National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer also indicated the presence of no
historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (THC 2011; NPS 2011). No
documented cultural resources, including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or
immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas data, no
previous cultural resources investigations have been conducted within or immediately adjacent
to the boundaries of the Project Area.
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the Project Area on
several elevated landforms adjacent to tributaries of the Nueces River, it was Horizon’s original
opinion that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
resources within the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, no structures are visible in proximity to the Project
Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map. This suggested a decreased potential for
undocumented historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the
boundaries of the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the Project Area ROW on 30 December 2011. This entailed intensive surface inspection and
subsurface shovel testing efforts within the boundaries of the proposed well pad and access
road ROW. The TSMASS require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres for projects
measuring between 11.0 and 100.0 acres in size. As such, a minimum of 9 to 10 shovel tests
were necessary within the 18.3-acre Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 26 shovel tests within the Project Area. These
tests were concentrated within areas under the purview of FEMA within the Project Area, which
included the majority of the proposed well pad and roughly the eastern half of the proposed
access road. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.0-millimeter [mm])
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. If any new archeological sites were recorded, standard site forms were to
be completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, if any previously recorded archeological sites were assessed, updated site
forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and
assessed in the field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo
log were completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. Shovel
test locations are presented in Figure 4-1. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the areas under FEMA’s purview within the Project
Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new prehistoric site. This site, 41MC584, is described
below.

6.1

SITE 41MC584

General Description
Site 41MC584 was documented as a relatively low-density prehistoric lithic scatter
located within and just outside of the southeastern quadrant of the proposed well pad (Figures
6-1 and 6-2). It is situated on the southeastern slope of a landform that lies between 2
tributaries of the Nueces River. The site appears to be intact and is covered with chaparral
vegetation typical of South Texas, including prickly pear cactus, mesquite, and huisache
(Figures 6-3 and 6-4).
The ground surface was covered with sparse short grasses that
provided a surface visibility between 50% and 75% across the clay surface of the site.
Due to the fact that the ground surface of the site consisted of dense argillic clays, the
site was delineated primarily via intensive surface inspection. However, a total of 11 shovel
tests were excavated over the site (see Figure 6.4). Of these 11 shovel tests, only 3 produced
evidence of shallow cultural deposits primarily contained within the upper 40.0 centimeters (cm)
(15.7 inches) of the site. This evidence consisted of the recovery of 5 chert flakes from depths
of 0.0 to 25.0 cm (0.0 to 9.8 inches) below surface and 1 chert flake from a depth between 20.0
and 40.0 cm (7.9 and 15.7 inches) below surface. The bulk of the observed cultural deposits
were contained within the southeastern quadrant of the proposed well pad. However, based on
the observed surface materials, the site’s horizontal extent continued beyond the staked well
pad boundaries to the east and south. In order to fully assess the site and determine its overall
NRHP eligibility status, the field crew delineated the full extent of the surface scatter both inside
and outside of the boundaries of the proposed well pad.

Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41MC584 consist of a low-density scatter of
primarily tertiary chert flakes recovered from the surface of the site, although several secondary
chert flakes were also observed (Figure 6-5). The 3 positive shovel tests excavated on the site
produced 5 tertiary chert flakes from depths of 0.0 to 25.0 cm (0.0 to 9.8 inches) below surface
and 1 tertiary chert flake from a depth between 20.0 and 40.0 cm (7.9 and 15.7 inches) below
surface. In addition to the chert debitage, the medial section of what appears to be a dart point
was also observed on the surface of the site. This specimen, made from a brown fine-grained
chert, bears fractures on both the proximal and distal ends. One lateral edge of this specimen
retains an intact barb, while the opposing lateral edge is lacking a barb and appears to have
been reworked (Figure 6-6). Aside from the noted lithic specimens, no other modified stone
tools, temporally diagnostic artifacts, fire-cracked rock, or preserved floral or faunal remains
were observed on the site.
Cultural Features
No evidence of cultural features was observed on the surface of the site or within any of
the 11 shovel tests excavated across the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed surface materials, the horizontal extent of site
41MC584 measures approximately 110.0 m (360.9 feet) north-south by 90.0 m (295.3 feet)
east-west.
While the vast majority of the cultural materials on site 41MC584 are confined to surface
contexts by the dense clay soils across the site, 3 positive shovel tests on the site indicated the
presence of sparse cultural deposits within the upper 40.0 centimeters (cm) (15.7 inches) of the
site. The recovered materials from these 3 positive shovel tests consisted of 5 chert flakes from
depths of 0.0 to 25.0 cm (0.0 to 9.8 inches) below surface and 1 chert flake from a depth
between 20.0 and 40.0 cm (7.9 and 15.7 inches) below surface.
Summary
Site 41MC584 was documented as a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located within
the southeastern quadrant of the proposed well pad. With the exception of 1 recovered dart
point fragment, the site consists entirely of lithic flaking debris located on the slope of a landform
situated between 2 tributaries of the Nueces River. The vast majority of observed cultural
material is confined to the argillic clay surface of the site, although 5 chert flakes were recovered
from subsurface contexts between 0.0 and 40.0 cm (0.0 and 15.7 inches) below surface. Aside
from the noted lithic specimens, no other modified stone tools, temporally diagnostic artifacts,
fire-cracked rock, or preserved floral or faunal remains were observed on the site.

Although this site’s boundaries extended beyond the limits of the proposed well pad, the
field crew assessed the entire extent of the site in order to fully determine its overall NRHP
eligibility status. Based on the presence of only surficial and shallow cultural deposits, the lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts, the lack of any observed cultural features, and the lack of
preserved floral and faunal materials, site 41MC584 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion
on the NRHP.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

On 30 December 2011, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of
PEC’s proposed Wheeler Unit 8 1H well pad and access road ROW in east-central McMullen
County, Texas. The proposed well pad measures approximately 500.0 by 500.0 feet (152.4 by
152.4 m), with a total area of 5.7 acres. The proposed access road ROW measures
approximately 11,000.0 feet (3352.8 m) in length and 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide, with a total area
of 12.6 acres. Overall, the Project Area totals 18.3 acres. Although the Project Area will be
located entirely on private property and will be constructed with private funds, its construction
will require coordination with FEMA. As a result, the portions of the undertaking under FEMA’s
purview also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended.
These areas included the majority of the proposed well pad and roughly the eastern half of the
proposed access road. Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on
behalf of PEC in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if the construction of the proposed well pad and access road within areas under the
purview of FEMA had the potential to have an adverse impact on any significant cultural
resources considered to be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
The TSMASS require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres for projects measuring
between 11.0 and 100.0 acres in size. As such, a minimum of 9 to 10 shovel tests were
necessary within the 18.3-acre Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 26 shovel tests within the Project Area. These
tests were concentrated within areas under the purview of FEMA within the Project Area, which
included the majority of the proposed well pad and roughly the eastern half of the proposed
access road.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the
documentation of 1 new prehistoric archeological site within the southeastern corner of the
proposed well pad. Site 41MC584 was documented as a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter
situated on the southeastern slope of an upland landform between 2 tributaries of the Nueces
River. Although this site’s boundaries extended beyond the limits of the proposed well pad, the
field crew assessed the entire extent of the site in order to fully determine its overall NRHP
eligibility status. Based on the presence of only shallow cultural deposits, the lack of temporally
diagnostic artifacts, the lack of any observed cultural features, and the lack of preserved floral
and faunal materials, site 41MC584 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP.

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Aside from 41MC584, no other cultural resources were documented within the areas under the
purview of FEMA within the Project Area.

7.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the assessment that site 41MC584 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion
on the NRHP, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed Wheeler Unit 8 1H
well pad and access road will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources within
areas under the purview of FEMA. Horizon therefore recommends that PEC be allowed to
proceed with the construction of the proposed well pad and access road, relative to the
jurisdiction of FEMA and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed well pad and
access road, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately and the THC and FEMA should be notified of the discovery.
