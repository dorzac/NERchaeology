Christmas Party will be at Ft. Concho in the Commissary. The Ice House Band will
entertain us. CVAS will pay for turkey and ham, members will bring side dishes. All
members are cordially invited to attend. See you there.
UP COMING EVENTS:
Our Next Meeting will be in January on the 26th,, in the new year of 2007. Albert
Redder will present the “Horn Shelter”.
Located on the western bank of the Brazos River approximately seven miles
downstream from the Whitney Dam, the Horn Shelter is a 150-foot-long rock
overhang. The discovery of the shelter, made by amateur archeologists Albert
Redder and Frank Watt, is contributing directly to the current academic discussion of
the origin of man in the Americas.
The shelter is one of the oldest known Paleo-American burial sites in Central
Texas, one of only three in the United States with burial goods.
The significant find has claimed international attention and ranks among the
most important in the United States. Mr. Redder will describe their work in
unearthing “Sam” known as Son of America.
An exhibit recently opened at the Bosque Memorial Museum in Clifton Texas
tells of Sam and the unwritten story of those that came before us.

CVAS Director
Commentary
A very important part of our society is the
CVAS Newsletter and Web Page. They keep
us informed on what is going on in the society.
Recently Jimmie Wilson editor of the
newsletter and Fred Wilson Webmaster
resigned from these positions. Over the past
eight years they have done an outstanding job
and deserve many, many thanks for the
countless hours they have contributed to this
position.
At the last monthly meeting Tim Brewster was
appointed to fill these positions until the upcoming
elections. Thank-you Tim for taking on this
responsibility and we the CVAS look forward to
working with you in the future.

CVAS President
Reflections
Hello fellow CVAS members.
Sorry I was not at the last meeting. I am still
not over the cold symptoms and I did not want
to share them with you.
I would like to thank Fred and Jimmie Wilson
for all the hard work they have done for CVAS
over the years. I hope they will continue to be
part of CVAS. The CVAS is experiencing
growing pains and we have things that we need
to work out as a club. I know feelings have been
hurt and things have been taken to heart that
are hard to forget. Remember what we all got
into CVAS for the love of the past and the
friendship of the meetings and trips. I hope we
all can work out our hard feelings and still come
and enjoy the CVAS family. Yes we are a family
we always don't agree and sometime we don't
even like each other but we all share the same
love for the history and past.
Larry is looking into a room at Fort Concho that
would relieve the time restraints we have now
and be larger to accommodate the large turn
outs we have been seeing. Also parking would
be next to the building and make it easier for us
with sore knees to get to the meeting.
Election of officers will be in January please try
to attend and help elect the officers that you
would like to be the leaders of CVAS for 2007.
Looking forward to seeing you at the next
meeting.

Friends and colleagues: Ancient Egypt excites the imagination of people all over the world. For
us at ALI, an intriguing film about Egypt is a chance to reach lots of people with messages about
the human cultural past. In this spirit, we present Trial of a Mummy, the latest video feature on
our nonprofit streaming-media Web site, The Archaeology Channel
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org).
Created by Egyptian director Mohamed El Abassery, this is the fictional story of Khonso-Imhep,
Head Musician of the Pharaoh's court during the 18th Dynasty, as he passes from life into the
afterworld, complete with a trial that determines his fate. Through re-enactments and imagery
on wall paintings, and delivered in Arabic with English subtitles, the film depicts the ancient
Egyptian mummification process and the religious rituals involved in preparing a dead body.
This story displays the unique funeral ceremonies surrounding the preparation of a mummy and
portrays the religious beliefs involved, as well as the mummy's discovery by archaeologists.
This and other programs are available on TAC for your use and enjoyment. We urge you to
support this public service by participating in our Membership
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org/member.html) and Underwriting
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org/sponsor.shtml) programs. Only with your help can we
continue and enhance our nonprofit public-education and visitor-supported programming. We
also welcome new content partners as we reach out to the world community.
Please forward this message to others who may be interested and let us know if you wish to be
removed from our mailing list.
