HAWK BELLS

No. of Specimens: 1 complete, 12 fragmentary
Provenience: Feature 1 (5), Feature 2 (1), Feature 3 (3), Feature
5 (3), Feature 6 (1)
Illustrations: Figure 42
These were made by joining together two cupped hemispheres of
sheet brass so as to form a hollow, approximately spherical "jingle"
bell. At least three different methods are known by which the two
hemispheres were joined together. One method was simply to solder
the two halves together with their edges flush. A second method was
to turn the edges of both halves outward and then solder them together under pressure so that a narrow flange was produced which
encircled the equatorial circumference of the bell. The third method
was to lap the edges of one half over the edges of the other half
and to crimp and/or solder them in place. A pellet of iron or other
substance was usually enclosed within the bell to make it tinkle.
The smallest bell (Fig. 42, a), and the only complete specimen, is
of the flanged-edge form with an iron pellet inside; the largest bell
(Fig. 42, g), represented by the reverse half only, is to all appearances
of the lapped-edge form. The other 11 specimens (Fig. 42, b-f) are all
of flush-edge construction.
Seven of the Gilbert hawk bells include all or part of the obverse
face. On all seven there are two round holes cut through the sheet
brass and a slit connecting the two holes. The slit was made by slicing
through the wall of the bell, without a strip of metal being removed
in the process. The seven specimens that include the reverse portions
of the bells all have an eye fastened at the back by which the bell was
attached to clothing or accouterment. The eyes are made of narrow
strips of brass bent into loops, with the two ends of the strip
inserted through a small hole and bradded on the inside of the bell in
the same way that the ends of a cotter pin are bradded down. A drop
of solder holds the bradded ends securely in place.
The 11 flush-edged specimens are all in the same general size range

(see dimensions below) and all have two or three parallel lines impressed into the surface, just back from the edge, on both the obverse
and reverse faces. One of them, in addition, has the letter D stamped
into the obverse face, evidently a maker’s mark.
The largest specimen consists of a reverse body half which is 38
ram. in diameter and has a maximum thickness of 15 ram.; the attachment eye is made of a heavy strip of brass about 3 mm. wide by 1.5
mm. thick formed into a loop that is 11 ram. in diameter. The sheet

brass from which this bell was made is appreciably thicker than that
of the smaller bells.
The body of the smallest specimen (the only complete one) is 12
ram. in diameter and 7 mm. thick. The attachment eye, approximately
3 mm. in diameter, is made of a brass strip about 1 mm. wide and perhaps 0.5 mm. thick. The flange where the two halves are joined is
about 1 mm. wide. The two round holes on the obverse face are 2 mm.
in diameter and 6 mm. apart.
There appear to be several slightly different sizes represented by the
11 fragmentary flush-edge hawk bells. Diameters range from 16 to 21
mm.; attachment eyes are relatively uniform at 4 to 5 mm. in diameter,
with the strips from which they are formed all being between 1 and
2 mm. wide by about .5 mm. thick. The obverse holes are 3 to 4 ram.
in diameter and they aa’e set from 7 to 11 mm. apart.
Remarks: Hawk bells are known from many sites in the southern
plains, but few have been described in sufficient detail for close comparisons. Twenty-five lapped-edge and two flanged-edge hawk bells
made of sheet brass were recovered from the White Site, a historie
burial in Yoakum County, Texas (Suhm, 1962b: 87-89). The flangededge specimens are too fragmentary for full deseription, but they have
attachment eyes like those from the Gilbert Site: that is, they were
made of narrow strips cut from sheet brass. The lapped-edge bells,
however, have wire eyes and differ further from the Gilbert specimens
in being almost perfectly spherical and in having two crossed slots in
the obverse face rather than a single slot with round holes at each end.
The slots, instead of being just sliced through, were made by removing narrow strips from the bell wall.
Newcomb (1955: 188) reports bells from the Yellowhouse Canyon
burial in Lubbock County, Texas, but he does not describe or illustrate
them. The editor of this report examined one of the Yellowhouse Canyon bells and found it to be identical with the lapped-edge bells
from the White Site. The Yellowhouse Canyon burial certainly
dates after 1858 as it contained an 1858 model pistol (Neweomb,
1955: 187), and the White Site probably dates between 1860 and 1875
(Suhm, 1962b: 116).
The Watson Site, a historic burial in Fisher County, Texas, has
been estimated to date between 189.0 and 1840 (Bay and Jelks, 1964:
139). It contained 39 flanged-edge and 6 flush-edge hawk bells, both
forms similar structurally to those from the Gilbert Site. A flangededge bell that is apparently identical to those from the Watson Site
has been reported from Kipp’s Post, South Dakota, a trading station
of the 1890’s (Woolworth and Wood, 1960: 9.89, and PI. 60, n).

Hawk bells comparable to those from the Gilbert Site have been
found at two pre-19th century sites: the Spanish Mission of San
Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz in Ileal County, Texas, and the Fanning
Site in Doniphan County, Kansas. The San Lorenzo Mission, which
was excavated in tile fall of 1962 by Curtis D. Tunnell of the Texas
Memorial Museum, is well documented and can be dated precisely
between 1760 and 1769 (Castafieda, 1939: 158-199)~ One hawk bell
(not yet described in print but examined by the editor) was found
there, a flush-edge specimen with a strip eye, paired grooves along
the equatorial seam, and hole-and-slit treatment of the obverse
face. It is essentially identical to the flush-edge specimens from the
Gilbert Site, the only difference being that along the paired gn’ooves
are tiny, closely spaced tick marks.
The Fanning Site in Kansas is estimated by Wedel (1959: 170-171)
to date prior to 1724 and perhaps earlier than 1700. Two hawk bells
found there appear to be of the flush-edge form, with strip eyes,
paired grooves along the equatorial seam, and hole-and-slit piercing
of the obverse face (ibid: 166 and P1. 13, g). Since one of them is 1.6
era. in diameter and the other is slightly larger, they are evidently
identical in al! respects, including size, to the flush-edge bells from
the Gilbert Site.
On the basis of the foregoing meager data, the following inferences
may be made as to stylistic changes in hawk bells traded into the
southern plains during the 18th and 19th centuries:
1. Hawk bells of tile 18th and early 19th centuries were of oblate
spheroid shape. Most were made with a hole-and-slit design cut
through the obverse face, and the attachment eye was made from a
narrow strip of sheet metal. The two halves of the body were joined
by either a flanged-edge or a flush-edge seam.
2. The most common kind of hawk bell during the latter half of the
19th century was approximately spherical and had an attachment eye
made of wire; there were two simple, crossed slots cut out of the obverse face; the body halves were joined by a lapped-edge seam.
Needless to say, these inferences cannot be proved or disproved
until more data have been compiled. It is believed, nevertheless, that
they are probably indicative of general trends in hawk bell styles, and
it is hoped that from this feeble beginning a useful, accurate typology
for hawk bells will develop. In any ease, this suggested chronology,
even though tentative and quite general, is all we have to go on at
present, and it leads us to estimate that the Gilbert Site hawk bells,
when considered strictly on the basis of typology, date somewhere between 1700 and 1850.

Illustrations: Figure 43
Tinklers were made by rolling into cones pieces of sheet brass which
had been cut to the desired shape and size. There are two basic forms:
(1) a cone with a point projecting downward from one side of the
base (Fig. 43, a-e), and (2) a cone with a base which is in a single
plane, or approximately so (Fig. 43, f-i). On all specimens a small
opening was left at the top of the cone through which a string or thong
could be passed for attachment. Most of the blanks from which the
tinklers were made were approximately rectangular or of isosceles
trapezoid shape. Interestingly, there is no apparent correlation between blank shape and cone shape: that is, both forms of blanks were
used for both the plane-base and the pointed-base forms of cones.
Some of the cones are slender, others are "fat". Most are between
20 and 40 mm. long, but the largest one measures 66 mm. in length
and the shortest one 16 mm. The sheet brass of which the tinklers
were made is of variable thickness, the thinnest being approximately
0.2 mm. thick, the thickest about 0.5 mm. thick, and most falling into
the intermediate range between those two figures.
The blanks, the presence of sheet-metal trimming scraps, and the
general appearance of the tinklers themselves indicate that these
ornaments were made by the Indians, not traded to them in finished
form. The source of the sheet metal is unknown, but probably discarded kettles and other containers acquired from the French and
Spanish provided a major portion. Several bail ears from sheet brass
kettles were recovered from the site (Fig. 46).
Tinklers similar to these are common to historic Indian sites
throughout most or all of the plains, including sites of the Nortefio
Focus. They were attached to garments or other articles by passing a
thong or cord through the opening at the small end of the cone and
knotting the end so that the cone would not slip off. Thus an Indian
clad in tinkler-trimmed garments would have, like the lady from Banbury Cross, music wherever he went.
PENDANTS

Provenience: Features 4, 5, and 10
IUustrations: Figure 44, a, b, g
One pendant (Fig. 44, a) is a small piece of sheet silver cut into
the shape of an isosceles triangle with a suspension hole at the apex
and four notches spaced along the base. The edges of the triangle
are slightly convex and the corners are rounded. One face has a

simple crosshatched design that appears to have been made by
placing the edge of a knife on the pendant and tapping it in with
a hammer. Since some of the lines were cut across the suspension
hole after its edges had been smoothed down, it is certain that the
crosshatching did not just happen to be on the piece of metal from
which the pendant was made but was intentionally put on the pendant

itself as a decoration. Across one corner, however, are two faint rows
of tiny triangular punctations that probably are a small surviving
remnant of some decoration that was on the piece of metal before
it was fashioned into the pendant. The notches appear to have been
made with a file.
A second pendant (Fig. 44, b), made of sheet brass, is also an
isosceles triangle perforated at the apex and notched along the base.
The apex has been squared off and the basal corners are slightly
rounded. The nine notches on the base are approximately equally
spaced, but they are much smaller than those on the silver pendant;
also, they seem to have been made with a sharp knife rather than by
filing. There is no decoration other than the basal notches.
The former specimen is 21 ram. high by 24 ram. wide at the base.
The latter is 25 ram. high, 19 mm. wide at the base, and about 0.5
ram. thick, somewhat thinner than the other.
Similar triangular pendants have been observed by the editor
in collections from other Nortefio Focus sites, but none of them has
been described in print.
The third pendant (Fig. 44, g) is made from a coin identified as
a French ecu (Reinfeld, 1955: 67). The obverse side of the coin is
decorated with the left profile of the head of Louis XV, and encircling the head appear the letters LUD ¯ XV ¯ D ¯ FR ET ¯ NAV
¯ REX. On the reverse side the letters BENEDICTUM ¯ 1749 SIT
NOMEN DOMINI W encircle a design consisting of a crown above
an oval containing three fleur de lis. Around the oval and extending
to the crown is a wreath of leaves:
Two holes were made in the coin above the profile of Louis XV.
Measurements: diameter, 32 ram.; thickness, 2 ram. The holes are
2 mm. in diameter and 8 mm. apart.

They range in length from 8 to 30 mm., and all are near 5 ram. in

FINGER

RINGS

No. of Specimens: 2
Provenience: Both from Feature 3
Illustrations: Figure 44, c
One of the finger rings (not illustrated) is a fiat metal strip bent
into a circle with a 3 mm. gap left between the ends. This plain, undecorated ring has an iron core that has been plated with brass.
The second ring (Fig. 44, c), cast in brass, has a heart-shaped area
on top which is bordered with a dashed line and has the Roman
numeral X in the center. Both the border and the X are stamped into
the surface of the metal rather than being molded or etched. The
sides of the ring, as they extend from the heart-shaped area, are
progressively narrower and thinner, the point opposite the heart
being quite slender and fragile.
The iron-cored specimen averages about 20 ram. in diameter, and
the strip from which it is formed is between 3 and 4 ram. wide by
approximately i mm. thick. The other ring averages about 19 ram.
in diameter, and the sides vary from a maximum of 3 mm. to a
minimum of 1 ram. wide and from less than 0.5 ram. to slightly
more than i ram. thick. The heart design is 19 ram. tall by 20 ram.
maximum breadth and is approximately 1.0 ram. thick.
The ring with the heart design can be readily identified as a style
which was formerly worn by Jesuits, although members of that order
are not allowed to wear rings of any kind today. The design is
intended to portray a bleeding heart, the dashed lines representing
drops of blood. Similar Jesuit rings, many with slashed or bleeding
heart designs and one with the Roman numeral XX, have been reported by Maxwell and Binford (1961:105 and P1. IX, e-r) from the
site of Fort Michilimackinac in Michigan, a historically documented
site dating from about 1715 to 1781, occupied first by French and
later by English troops.
The Jesuit ring from the Gilbert Site is surely of French origin;
therefore, it probably reached the Indians of the upper Trinity River
region via the French trading post of Natchitoches, Louisiana. Since
the first Jesuit priest regularly assigned to Natchitoches arrived there
in 1730 (Nardini, 1961: 43), and as the French Jesuit priests were
generally replaced tba’oughout Louisiana by Spanish Franciscans after
the Treaty of Paris in 1763, those two dates (that is, 1730 and 1763)

may be considered to bracket, generally, the most likely period of
time during which a Jesuit ring might have reached the vicinity of
the Gilbert Site.
This specimen was analyzed spectographieally by R. E. Forrester
who reported the following metals to be present, in order of quantity:
copper, tin, zinc and lead (equal proportions), and silver.
BU~-rONS

No. of Specimens: 9.
Provenience: Features 9. and 4
Illustrations: Figure 44, d-e
A plain brass button (Fig. 44, d), from Feature 2, is an example
of the spun-back variety pictured by Olsen (1963: Fig. 1, D). The
body is 17 mm. in diameter and about 1 mm. thick; the eye is 4 mm.
across. According to Olsen (ibid.: 552), spun-back buttons were in
use by both civilians and the militalT throughout the 1760-1785
period.
The other button (Fig. 44, e) is represented by a plain obverse
part of a two-piece form. It is made of sheet brass in the shape of a
flattened hemisphere, and its edges are bent inward where they were
at one time crimped around the backing piece, which presumably
was made of wood, bone, or metal. The diameter is 16 ram., the
maximum thickness 5 mm. The sheet metal, by estimate, is less than
0.5 mm. thick. According to Olsen (1963:552 and Fig. 1, F, I) the
first two-piece, all metal buttons were made about 1812, and the
earliest ones shaped like the specimen in question here appeared
about 1830. Two-piece bone- or wood-backed buttons, however, are
said by Olsen (ibid.: 552) to have been in use as early as 1700. We
are unable to tell from the Gilbert specimen what kind of back
it had.

This imperfectly spherical lead ball is perforated through the approximate center. It is battered and flattened on one end.
The perforation is round, diminishing in diameter from 2.2 mm.
at one end to 1 mm. at the other, thus producing a hole with the
shape of a truncated cone. The hole may have been made by hammering a sharp implement into the ball, thus producing the flattened
end of the bead, or the hole may have been produced by drilling.

Glass beads constituted an important item of trade on the southern
plains in the 18th century. A large sample was collected from the
Gilbert Site, mainly by washing midden soil from the features through
fine-mesh screen.
The beads were classified according to a system originally worked
out by Duflqeld and Jelks (1961: 40-51) and later modified by Harris,
Harris, Blaine, and Blaine (1965: 307-315). Under this system beads
are classified on the basis of size, color, shape, use, and structure.
Beads are graded by size as follows (all measurements are outside
diameter): small (0 to 4 ram.), medium (4 to 6 ram.), and large
(more than 6 mm.). A color chart (Bustanoby, 1947: 28-29) was used
to designate the color of the beads. The various shapes are described
with the same terms used by Harris, Harris, Blaine, and Blaine ( 1965:
307-315) in their report on the Womack Site. Use is indicated by
the terms necldace and garter. Documentary evidence (Du Pratz,
quoted in Swanton, 1911: 56) states that larger beads were used
mainly for necklaces, while medium and small ones were used mostly
for making colorful designs on skins, garters, and the like.
As to structure, beads were classified as simplo (one homogeneous
piece of glass), compound (formed of two or more different-colored
concentric layers of glass), and complex (decorated with stripes, dots,
or other designs). Techniques of manufacture are: hollow-cane,
faceted, and mandrel- or wire-wound. At the Gilbert Site, bead types
40, 41, 53, and 54 are mandrel-wound; types 40 and 41 have facets

that were pressed while the glass was molten; all the others were
made by the hollow-cane method. The terms tumbled, untumbled,
and twisted have the following meanings: tumbled-after breaking
the hollow canes to the desired length, the broken sections were
placed in a heated drum which was rotated, a process that rounded
the broken edges; untumbled-the beads were not tumbled but
were used with their edges sharp; twisted- the hollow canes were
twisted as they were drawn out.
Descriptions of the bead types from Gilbert follow. The type
numbers refer to specific types in a general system of bead classification that has been worked out by R. K. Hart% and is soon to be
published in its entirety.

was between 1740 and 1770.
