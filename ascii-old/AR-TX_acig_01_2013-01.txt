Abstract
On August 29, 2012, prior to the construction of a proposed 8,660 feet of wastewater line
in Cedar Park, Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted an intensive
archeological survey in accordance with Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and Texas
Historical Commission (THC) guidelines along a 2,400-linear-foot by 30-foot wide (1.65
acres) section of the proposed wastewater line that had not been subject to previous survey
and was not in an existing wastewater alignment. This work was conducted incompliance
with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under TAC permit number 6325. A
pedestrian survey was conducted, and three shovel tests were excavated in relatively
undisturbed areas with poor surface visibility. No archeological sites were discovered. One
isolated prehistoric artifact, a large uniface, was found in a disturbed area on the west end
of the surveyed section of the proposed wastewater line. Based on the results of this
archeological survey, no further archeological work is recommended. Records from this
investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The City of Cedar Park is proposing to construct a new wastewater line, called the
Buttercup Interceptor Wastewater Line, in Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas. The
proposed construction consists of 8,660 linear feet of wastewater pipeline, 2,400 feet of
which require a cultural resources survey (Figure 1).
The project area generally traverses parallel to Buttercup Creek, north of Lakeline
Boulevard and between Bell Boulevard (just west of Hwy 183) and Cypress Creek Road
(CR 182) in Cedar Park, Texas (see Figure 1). The southwestern extent of the proposed
construction begins approximately 1,000 feet south of Lakeline Boulevard just west of a
tributary to Buttercup Creek. This segment extends 966 feet northeast to Lakeline
Boulevard where it terminates when it reaches a previously replaced portion of the
wastewater line that is not within the scope of the project. This southwestern portion of
the alignment will be constructed in existing easement. The proposed wastewater pipeline
construction restarts at Buttercup Creek approximately 1,200 feet to the north, and
continues east along Buttercup Creek for approximately 6,800 feet until it reaches S. Bell
Boulevard, which is the eastern extent of the project. The westernmost 2,000 feet is
located in an area that had been previously surveyed for cultural resources. The
remainder of the alignment is in existing easement with the exception of 2,400 feet
(highlighted in Figure 1), which is not in existing easement and requires archeological
survey.
On January 30, 2012, coordination with the THC project reviewer, Bradford Jones, was
initiated. Aci consulting summarized the proposed project indicating those areas
previously investigated, areas where the wastewater line is being replaced in the original
easement, and those areas that have not been subject to previous investigations. The
consensus at the meeting was that only the 2,400-linear-foot section of the alignment that
had not been previously surveyed and was not in existing easement required
archeological survey at this time (see Figure 1). Therefore, the Area of Potential Effect
(APE) has been defined as this 2,400-foot segment of the proposed wastewater line with
a 30-foot wide temporary construction easement (1.65 acres). The permanent easement is
20 feet in width.
This investigation consisted of an intensive archeological survey of the approximately
2,400-linear-foot (1.65 acres) APE, pursuant to Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC
26.20[2]). The overall investigation included pedestrian survey, photography, subsurface
testing (shovel testing), basic archival research and National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and State Archeological Landmark (SAL) eligibility assessment, data analysis,
and report preparation in accordance with THC and CTA standards. The records from
this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. The
concurrence letter from the THC is included as Appendix A.

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 Environmental Setting
The project area is located in central Texas in the Blackland Prairie, approximately two
miles east of the Balcones Escarpment, a fault zone with hills to the west and north and
low relief to the east and south. The topography to the west of the Balcones Escarpment,
the Balcones Canyonlands, is hilly and characterized by the presence of springs, karstic
sinks, caves, and rock shelters. The Blackland Prairie is characterized by low relief and
dark clays that support prairie vegetation along with small woods often found along low
gradient streams. The project area is within the âOak-Mesquite-Juniper Parksâ
designation, as noted on the Texas Parks and Wildlife âVegetation Types of Texasâ map
(McMahan et al. 1984). The proposed project area runs along Buttercup Creek and its
tributaries, which now flow into the Soil Conservation Service Site 6 Reservoir.
2.2 Soils
The Soil Conservation Service (SCS 1983) classifies the soils in the project area as the
Denton-Eckrant-Doss association (Figure 2). These soils consist of moderately deep,
shallow to very shallow, calcareous, clayey, cobbly, and stony soils formed in indurated
fractured limestone or limey earth on uplands. Three soil units are found within the entire
project area. However, the shallow Eckrant cobbly clay is the predominant soil in the area
requiring cultural resource survey.
ï·
ï·
ï·
ï·

Doss silty clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes (DoC)
Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes (EaD)
Fairlie clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes (FaB)
Oakalla soils, channeled (Oc)

Doss silty clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes (DoC) â This soil is found on gently sloping areas
irregular in shape and ranging from 10 to 50 acres. The surface layer is about nine inches
thick and is a dark grayish brown. The following layer is 19 inches of brown silty loam
with an underlying material of cemented limy earth interbedded with fragments of
limestone. The available water capacity is low and the permeability is moderately slow
due to the shallow depth of the limestone. This soil is well drained.
Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes (EaD) â This soil is generally found in
irregular shapes on undulating uplands ranging in size from 50 to 500 acres. The surface
consists of around 13 inches of a dark grayish-brown cobbly layer. The underlying
material consists of coarsely fractured indurated limestone. The soil is moderately
permeable as long as it does not dry to the point of cracking. It is well drained, and the
available water capacity is very low.

Archaic in that burned rock features are present, but they are not as large or ubiquitous as
those associated with the Archaic. Other artifacts, features, and faunal remains seem
more similar to those found later in the Archaic.
Archaic (Collins 1995:383-385) sites in Central Texas are most often associated with the
use of heated rock in hearths, ovens, middens, and scatters. The period as a whole is
defined by the intensified use of local resources and diversity of material culture in
comparison to the Paleoindian period. The climate ranged from mesic (relatively moist)
in the Early Archaic and the later part of the Late Archaic and xeric (relatively dry)
during the Middle Archaic and beginning of the Late Archaic. Subsistence during mesic
times is centered on the live-oak savanna while a shift in emphasis toward xerophytes
may have occurred during xeric intervals.
The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups, primarily from
the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics into the archeological
record takes place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans
inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
3.2 Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when Spanish explorers traveled through the
region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas. Captain Alonso De LeÃ³n
followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop several times during the 1680s,
and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and
Captain Domingo Ramon, a Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and
camped on the banks of Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them
Arroyo do las BendÃ­tas Ãnimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, the
Marques de Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through
present-day Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions. In the mideighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established along the San Gabriel
River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753, drought and disease
made the missions uninhabitable, and Spanish influence in the area declined (Odintz
2002).
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. In 1835,
continual attacks by local Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and his company
of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the headwaters of Brushy
Creek, in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson Fort, as it was called, was
abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several veterans
of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838, Dr. Thomas Kenney and his family
built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson County. Kenneyâs Fort
6

became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County. However, Indian attacks were
a frequent problem, and numerous settlers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians. By
1846, the Indian threat had waned and settlement in the region increased. In 1848, the
Texas legislature established Williamson County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a
Milam County Judge and state senator.
By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the San
Gabriel (Odintz 2002), but a few families were living in the western half. During the
1850s and 1860s, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up around the county.
Although urbanization and industrialization increased somewhat, the bulk of the county
remained rural and agricultural. The majority of the families lived on subsistence farms in
log houses and raised corn. During the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave population
increased and the agricultural patterns within the county became more diverse. Wheat
and corn were the predominant crops in the Blackland prairies, and cattle and sheep
ranching was widespread throughout the county. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but
it was not a significant cash crop.
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War but picked up again in
the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the expansion of cotton
farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisholm trail, which was established
in 1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle drives passed through or originated
in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s were also marked by the arrival of railroads
to Williamson County (Odintz 2002).
By the early twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry in
importance. With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm tenancy
developed. As late as 1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by owners. By
1890, 43 percent of the farms were worked by owners, and by 1930, only 29 percent of
the farms were worked by owners. The tenancy rates continued to drop during the Great
Depression (Odintz 2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of soil
depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil infestation.
The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation and encouraged
farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton production was reduced by nearly
half, while sorghum and wheat became important crops. Along with cattle and sheep,
poultry farming intensified (Odintz 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped areas of
Williamson County meant urban populations now had easier access to the Hill Country
and vice versa. The consolidation of rural schools also meant children could now attend
schools outside of their rural communities. For example, during the 1910s and 1920s,
Rock House School was one of the largest schools in Williamson County. In 1903, the
school boasted a population of 96 students and 2 teachers. The school was consolidated

7

with Liberty Hill School in 1947, and by the 1990s, Rock House had become a dispersed
agricultural community.
Suburbanization of the portions of the county bordering Austin caused the population of
Williamson County to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the population of
Williamson County was 37,305. By 1982, the population had grown to over 85,700
(Odintz 2002). A pattern of absentee ownership and of non-agricultural use of the land
also intensified following World War II. Austin, Georgetown, and Liberty Hill grew
rapidly.
3.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
The Texas Historical Commissionâs Sites Atlases were accessed in the search for
information about previous surveys in the area and the locations of previously recorded
sites. Records were also reviewed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL). The Historic Sites Atlas indicated that there were no cemeteries, historical
markers, or other significant historical properties located near the proposed wastewater
line. The Archeological Sites Atlas database shows numerous recorded sites in the area
including two sites within the previously surveyed sections of the proposed alignment
(Figure 3). According to desktop analysis, an approximately 2,000-foot section of the
proposed wastewater line had been previously subject to pedestrian survey (Brownlow
2002 and Owens 2009, see Figure 3).
The two sites previously recorded within the proposed alignment, Site 41WM1036, and
Site 41WM1037, were determined to be not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP in
Brownlow (2002). These sites are not within the project APE. Site 41WM1036 is a sparse
prehistoric lithic scatter overlooking Buttercup Creek. Four artifacts, 3 flakes and a
metate fragment, were discovered on the surface, but shovel testing revealed no buried
deposits. The eastern edge of Site 41WM1037 abuts the proposed alignment. This
historic farmstead includes two structures, a windmill, a water trough, and an extensive
scatter of historic trash along with a light scatter of prehistoric artifacts. With the
exception of the windmill and water trough, the site report notes that all historic
structures have been razed. The prehistoric component is limited to the surface and lacks
temporally diagnostic features and distinct cultural features.
Sites 41WM1038 and 41WM1039 were also reported by Brownlow (2002). Site
41WM1038 is a low density lithic scatter lacking in intact cultural deposits, while Site
41WM1039 is a sparse scatter of historic trash. These two sites are located close to, but
not within, the proposed alignment. Both sites were assessed as not eligible for inclusion
on the NRHP.
A transmission line project survey (Owens 2009) runs perpendicular to the proposed
Buttercup Interceptor wastewater line and intersects the alignment adjacent and to the
west of the Brownlow (2002) survey area. No sites were recorded within the Buttercup
Interceptor alignment.

A number of cultural resource surveys have been conducted within one mile of the
Buttercup Interceptor alignment. An Environmental Protections Agency cultural
resources survey was conducted west of Cypress Creek Road, and 18 sites were recorded
just west of Cypress Creek Road. Texas Parks and Wildlife conducted a survey in 2005 to
the east of S. Bell Blvd., and a few sites were recorded near S. Bell Blvd. Closer to the
proposed alignment, PBS&J (Fischbeck 2007) surveyed an 18-acre parcel north of the
alignment, and two LCRA linear surveys were conducted at the same latitude. No sites
were discovered during these efforts. To the south of the project area, Schroeder (2006)
conducted a cultural resource survey prior to construction of U.S. 183A and located one
historic homestead, which was not considered eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
4.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY
Following a review of the current archeological sites data, a 100% pedestrian survey of
the 2,400-foot-long by 30-foot-wide portion (see Figures 1 and 3) of the proposed
wastewater line that had not been subject to previous archeological survey and does not
fall within the existing wastewater alignment was conducted to locate any archeological
or historical sites that may be adversely affected by construction of the wastewater line.
The methodology of sub-surface testing consisted of shovel testing due to the shallow
depth of deposits. The remaining portion of the proposed wastewater line that either had
been previously investigated or will consist of a replacement of the wastewater line
within the exiting easement was not subject to pedestrian survey or shovel testing.
Survey methods complied with THC/CTA survey standards for the overall project area.A
pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted in order to locate any archeological or
historical sites that would be adversely affected by construction. Archeologists from aci
walked the APE in parallel transects spaced no greater than 30 meters apart. Because
sediment depth was shallow, shovel testing was adequate to assess the Eckrant cobbly
clay deposits found in the survey area without the need for deep soil testing.
Shovel tests were excavated in settings with the potential for buried cultural horizons or if
the ground surface visibility was less than 30 percent. Shovel tests were excavated at
least 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter to the bottom of Holocene deposits. The shovel
tests were dug in levels no thicker than 20 cm, and the excavated sediments was screened
through Â¼-inch hardware cloth.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
During the pedestrian survey, one isolated find, a large uniface, was found at the west end
of the APE (Figures 4 and 5). The uniface was found in a disturbed area adjacent to a
housing development. No additional artifacts or evidence of prehistoric activity were
observed. The artifact was photographed and not collected.
The APE showed signs of disturbance from the construction of the residential
development on the west end and the construction of the reservoir on the very eastern
end. In addition, a section of the proposed wastewater line within the APE runs along the
edge of a two-track road. Between the two-track road and the grassland at the western
end of the project, there were push piles indicating additional ground-moving activities.
Due to high surface visibility in sections of the APE, shovel testing was limited to three
shovel tests excavated along the 2,400 linear feet of the APE (Figure 4, Table 2). Two
shovel tests were dug toward the west end of the APE in areas with poor surface visibility
and the potential for buried deposits in the silty clay loam (Figure 6). Surface visibility
was impeded by thick grasses. Both shovel tests were negative, and the sediments were
only 9 cm and 18 cm in thickness above bedrock.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In advance of the construction of a proposed wastewater line in Cedar Park, Texas,
archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey and shovel testing (n=3)
in accordance with CTA and THC guidelines along a 2,400-linear-foot by 30-foot wide
(1.65 acres) section of the proposed wastewater line that had not been subject to previous
survey and was not in an existing wastewater alignment. This work was conducted in
compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]). No intact prehistoric or
historic deposits were discovered. One isolated prehistoric artifact, a large uniface, was
found in a disturbed area on the west end of the APE. Based on the results of this
archeological survey, no further archeological work is recommended.
