Abstract
Flatrock Enginering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources linear survey of a segment
of the Gravity Midstream Product Pipeline rights-of-way through a tract of land owned by the Port
of Corpus Christi Authority in Nueces County, Texas. The Area of Potential Effect is 1,368 meters
(0.85 miles; 4,488 feet) long x 24.39 meters (80 feet) wide, for a total of 8.25 acres. Texas
Antiquities Permit #7527 was issued in order to proceed with the archaeological investigations.
The entire Project Area consisted of soils classified as ‘Made Land’ presumably dredged from
Nueces Bay in order to create the adjacent shipping channel. Surface visibility within the Project
Area ranged from roughly 60 to 100 percent. Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a
thorough pedestrian survey on January 13, 2016 and excavated one shovel test along the ship
channel shoreline where surface visibility was approximately 60 percent.
Upon our arrival we noted that a boring machine and associated equipment were in place on the
south edge of Nueces Bay and north of Joe Fulton Boulevard. Notably, this operation was not
being conducted by Gravity Midstream, but by another contractor.
Nevertheless, no evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural material was observed within
the Project Area. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommended that construction of the Gravity
Midstream Product Pipelines through the Port Authority of Corpus Christi-owned property should
be allowed to proceed as currently designed. The project should be considered as having “no
effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should
be allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

Introduction

Gravity Midstream
Corpus Christi, LLC of
Houston, Texas is the
lead agency for the
Gravity Midstream
Product Pipeline rightsof-way that are proposed
for construction on a tract
of land owned by the Port
o f C o r p u s C h ri s t i
Authority.
Gravity Midstream in turn
contracted with Flatrock
Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd. of
San Antonio to ensure the
requirements for
environmental and
cultural assessments
would be conducted in a
professional compliance
manner. At the request of
Flatrock, Tierras Antiguas Figure 1. Location of the Project Area, and Nueces County in Texas.
Archaeological
Investigations (TAAI) conducted a cultural resources survey of the Project Area (PA) on January
13, 2016 (Figures 1-3).
The project is privately funded, however because the property is owned by the Port of Corpus
Christi Authority, a Texas Antiquities Permit was required. Based upon a Scope of Work and
Antiquities Permit Application, the Texas Historical Commission issued Permit #7527, authorizing
the cultural resources survey. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). In addition to a surface
survey of the 1,368 linear meters, Tierras Antiguas excavated one shovel test in the only area that
offered less than 60 percent surface visibility.

Project Setting
Geology, Soils, and Hydrology
As shown in Figures 4 and 5, the Port Authority of Corpus Christi-owned tract (see also, Figure
3) is located on Fill and Spoil consisting of mixed muds, silt, sand, and shell dredged for creating
land by raising land surfaces above alluvium and barrier island deposits. Typically, these deposits
form islands along waterways (Fisher 1975), such as the Viola Ship Channel.

As shown in Figure 6, the Project Area is primarily located on dredged and Made Land (Ma), on
the north edge of the Viola Shipping Channel. “This land consists of piles of sand, mud, and shells
that have been excavated from the floor of lagoons and bays”. Otherwise, a short southwestern
segment of the pipelines will course through Tital flats (Ta). “Tidal flats are mainly barren, nearly
level areas that are above salt water at low tide but are normally flooded at high tide. Layers of
sand, shells, and clay make up tidal flats, but these layers are not consistent in texture, in
thickness, or in their arrangement” (Franki et al. 1992:14, 16-17; Websoil Survey 2016).

Archival research of various topographic maps and aerial photographs illustrate when this land
was made and dredged from the Nueces Bay shoreline in the 1960s in order to create the deep
Viola Shipping Channel. Shown in Figure 7 are the proposed Gravity Lines super-imposed over
a chronological composite of the Project Area from 1951 through the present. Note that in 1951
the terrestrial land strip did not exist. However, in the 1960s, the terrestrial deposits were evident
above the bay floor.

Nueces County Elevations, Rivers, and Streams
The low elevations in Nueces County range from sea level along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline,
up to 200 feet above sea level in the western portions of the county where the coastal plains give
way to rolling caliche hills. Southeasterly flowing rivers and creeks include the Aransas and
Nueces rivers, and Chiltipin, Oso, San Fernando, and Petronila creeks (Long 1996). Hurricane
storm surges have frequently inundated the low coastal areas as well as areas further inland along
the Nueces River and Rincon Bayou.
Flora, Fauna, and Climate
The Project Area lies within the Coastal Prairie physiographic region of Texas (Figure 8). The
region is made up of a complex of marshes, upland grassland, and some forested habitat. Along
riverine environs are primarily large elms and oaks, along with some relict sabal palms, and
thornscrub. Otherwise, mesquite, huisache, tall prairie grasses, and prickly pear cacti are common.
The regional flora area has been classified as being part of the Tamaulipan biotic province
extending out from northeast Mexico (Figure 9). This is the only part of Texas where some
vegetation exhibits growth throughout the year (Blair 1950). Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively recent occurrence, with a mix of woody and grassland
species providing a savanna environment during prehistoric times (Black 1989; Hester 1980; Inglis
1964).

6

The original vegetation was an open
grassland mixed with brushy chaparral.
Oaks, pecan, and ash were common along
perennial streams. Due in part to
overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the
invasion of woody species has changed
the vegetation into “Texas brush country”
dominated by mesquite, acacia, spiny
hackberry, brazil, whitebrush, lotebrush,
and others (Diamond et al. 1987:203221). On sandy soils, the brush includes
mesquite with mixed grasses. In contrast,
clay soils support mesquite (Proposis
juliflora), various species of Acacia, and
mimosa, granjeno or desert hackberry
(Celtis pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera
angustifolia, lindheeimeri), tasajillo
(Opuntia leptocaulis), and species of
Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950).
Modern vegetation in Nueces County
includes cordgrasses, salt grasses, marsh
millet, tall grasses, oak, acacias,
mesquite, and prickly pear (Long 1996). Figure 8. Physiographic regions of Texas
(http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg).
Modern wildlife includes deer, javelina,
rabbits, raccoons, coyotes, bobcat, quail,
muskrat, beaver, mink, ring-tailed cat,
badger, fox, turkey, duck, geese,
jacksnipe, sandhill crane, and whooping
crane. The average annual rainfall in the
two counties is just over 30 inches. The
average low temperature is just over 46
degrees in January, the average high
temperature is 93 degrees in July, and the
average number of growing season days
is 306. Overall, the climate can be
classified as humid subtropical (Long
1996).

Cultural Context and Chronology
The Project Area lies within the Central Texas Coast archaeological region as refined by Ricklis
(2004). All dates are given as approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,000 - 7500 B.P.)
Although some Paleoindian artifacts have been found, no intact paleoindian components have
been found in the Central Texas Coast region, so that a chronology of the Paleoindian period or
stage cannot be adequately defined (Ricklis 2004). Exasterbating the discovery of intact
components is due in part to the rising sea level along the coast since Paleoindian campsites were
occupied; those campsites are presumably under water, far east of today’s shoreline. Ricklis
surmises that if buried and intact Paleoindian components are discovered, they will be in today’s
riverine environments away from the modern Gulf of Mexico shoreline.
Early Archaic (7500 - 4200 B.P.)
Two sub-periods are recognized during the 3,300-year Early Archaic period along the Central
Texas Coast. The earlier sub-period ranges from about 7500 to 6800 B.P., and is based upon
radiocarbon dates from shoreline archaeological sites in the Nueces Bay area. Sites during this
period are predominantly oyster shell middens situated on upland margins overlooking the bay.
These middens are the result of exploitation of oysters as a food source, but more often than not
few artifacts have been found. Those chipped stone pieces that have been found resemble Central
and South Texas, Uvalde and Gower dart points. Worked shell pieces include flaked sunray venus
clamshell scrapers and knives. Faunal remains are mostly non-existant at these sites, but that could
be due to the relative rapid disintegration of bone in the silty soils. Otherwise, only a few of the
more resiliant fish otoloiths have been found, suggesting that the occupants of the shoreline at this
time relied heavily on shellfish as their primary food source.
A valid archaeological record for the next circa 1,000 years is largely unknown. However, the later
sub-period of Early Archaic shoreline occupation sites date to around 5800-4200 B.P. Ricklis sites
radiocarbon data from 15 site components dating to this period. Cultural manifestations during this
sub-period are primarily oyster shell lenses, with occasional fish otoloiths and chert flakes.
However, one site (41NU221 - McKinzie Site) yielded a relatively thick shell midden, along with
hundreds of chert flakes, two Bell points, a Tortugas point, and two modified shells. Triangular
dart points have also been found on the surface at the Means Site (41NU184) in Nueces County.
Potential evidence of an Early Archaic structure in the form of post molds were also documented
at 41NU184 (Ricklis and Gunter 1986). Although animal bones are not generally found at these
sites, the presence of chipped stone dart points and scrapers suggest that hunting must have been
very much a part of the subsistence base. Seasonally, data retrieved from oyster shells and fish
otoliths indicate that shellfish were most likely exploited in the winter through early spring, and
fish were trapped or caught in the fall and early spring. Although Ricklis (2004) surmises that
based upon the number of sites discovered, human populations may have increased during this
later sub-period, he cautions that the number of sites that could have existed during the earlier subperiod may well have been destroyed and removed by a dynamically eroding landscape.
8

Middle Archaic (4200 - 3100 B.P.)
This period is poorly dated, and may reflect a hiatus in Gulf shoreline occupation between 4200
and 3100 B.P. Ricklis (2004) opines that the numerous midden shell deposits that were present
during the Early Archaic and Late Archic, are either absent during the Middle Archaic, or are most
certainly few in number. Environmentally, the relative absence could be attributed to a rapid sea
level rise and highstand during the Middle Archaic. Much more effort needs to be exerted to find
and research Middle Archaic components before this period can begin to be more clearly
understood.
Late Archaic (3100 - 950 B.P.)
Roughly 3,000 years ago, the sea level in the Gulf of Mexico stabilized to what we see it today.
Much like Central Texas, the archaeological sites along the Central Texas Gulf Coast are larger
than during the Early Archaic, the middens at these sites are thicker, and there are a relatively
wider variety of tools were being produced and utilized. These data strongly suggest that
populations increased significantly, and sites were likely occupied for longer periods of time.
Concurrent with the stabilized shoreline, and in effect the biotic production offered in coastal
estuaries, gathering shellfish became a very important food source, but supplemented with fish and
white-tailed deer. Around the middle of the Late Archaic, ca. 2,000 years ago, fishing became very
much an important part of the subsistence base. One of the more important Late Archaic
archaeological sites investigated is the Kent-Crane site (41AS3). It is situated on a shoreline bluff
above Copano Bay, was likely occupied as early as about 2,700 years ago, and extends for roughly
1,000 meters along the bluff. The intensive occupation at Kent-Crane is manifested by a sea shell
midden as much as 1.8-meters thick.
A second significant archaeological site in the Central Texas Gulf Coastal area that represents a
Late Archaic occupation period is the Mustang Lake site (41CL3). Once again, this site was
occupied during a period of apparent sea level stabilization very similar to today’s level. The first
occupations at the Mustang Lake site appear to be temporally co-eval with those at the Kent-Crane
site. Once again, there are dense layers of oyster shells, along with bone, and chipped stone. In the
upper-most portion of these midden layers, archaeologists found sandy-paste pottery sherds. Other
significantly important Central Texas Gulf Coastal, Late Archaic sites investigated at Ingleside
Cove on the northeastern shore of Corpus Christi Bay include 41SP43 and 41SP120.
Late Prehistoric (950 - 250 B.P. [A.D. 1000 - 1700])
Along the Central Texas Coast area, a marked change in stone tools, the transition from the
shoulder-thrown atlatl to the bow and arrow as a more accurate and deadly killing weapon, and
the production of clay vessels for storage and cooking occurred around 950 B.P. (A.D. 10001700). Ricklis (2004) divides the Central Texas Coast Late Prehistoric period into two subperiods, the Initial Late Prehistoric and the Final Late Prehistoric.
Initial Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1000-1250/1300)
A robust Initial Late Prehistoric occupation excavated at 41SP120 dates to between A.D. 1022 and
1209. Fish consumption was prolific, with human dietary needs supplemented by the hunting and
9

consumption of deer. Arrow points recovered at 41SP120 included triangular, Fresno-like
specimens. Further north within the coastal area, Scallorn arrow points have been found in
association with plain, sandy-paste pottery sherds. Although sandy-paste pottery appears to have
been manufactured during the earlier part of this sub-period, there is evidence to suggest that
decorated wares such as Rockport Black-on-Gray were a result of evolving pottery manufacturing
and design during the later centuries.
Final Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1250/1300 - 1700)
As with much of the rest of what we now know as Texas, the archaeological record in the Central
Texas Coast area reveals that the variety of chipped stone tools increased dramatically, and the
manufacturing of ceramic vessels in terms of quality, shape, and style changed significantly. These
changes demonstrated a marked advancement in tool production, and food storage and cooking
manufacturing technology, and further infer substantial changes in subsistence choices and mobility
patterns that occurred during this roughly 450-year period.
Chipped stone tools include smaller and presumably stream-lined arrow points such as the Perdiz
type, small unifacially flaked end scrapers, bifacially flaked knives, drills, and small prismatic
blades removed from blade cores. Pottery sherds found at period sites include those from bowls,
jars, and ollas which have been coated or decorated with asphaltum, and may have incised designs,
and even ceramic smoking pipes. Pottery types during the Final Late Prehistoric are named as
Rockport Incised, Rockport Crenelated, and Rockport Black-on-Gray; otherwise referred to as the
“Rockport Phase”. Remains found at Rockport Phase sites suggest the reliance of fish as a food
source probably reached its peak in prehistory, while the reliance on shellfish was largely
overshadowed.
There appears to be a non-discrete boundary between sites located close to the Gulf Coast
compared to those located roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) inland. At about that imaginary line,
Rockport pottery typical of shoreline occupations wanes, whereas bone-tempered pottery so typical
of Late Prehistoric Toyah occupations (e.g., Collins 2004; Hester 2004; Hester and Parker 1970;
Black 1986) tends to be prevalent. It was during the latter part of this Final Late Prehistoric subperiod when the bison became so much a predominate part of Toyah occupation, that the reliance
on bison herds also penetrated the imaginary 40-kilometer line west of the Gulf Coast, along the
riverine environs leading to the coast. For example, at the Mellon site (41RF21) in Refugio County,
bison and deer bones were found in association with Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points, and
Rockport pottery sherds.
Historic (ca. A.D. 1700-Present)
Although the coast of the Gulf of Mexico was charted by Spanish Captain Alonso Alvarez de
Pineda in 1520, perhaps the earliest white men to see this land area of Texas were Alvar Nuñez
Cabeza de Vaca, and two or three of his shipwrecked companions. De Vaca traversed parts of
southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the huntergatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). His stay with the Miriami in
1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves to the easily
exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally sending a hunting
10

party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near each other in
the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other succulents (Campbell
and Campbell 1981:13-37). In addition, his diary speaks extensively of the ways of the Karankawa
Indians, a nomadic tribe that favored the modern site of the community of Refugio as a campsite
and eventual permanent village (Leffler 1996).
In 1749, the faithful Catholic fathers, with support from the Spanish Crown, moved Mission Señora
del Espiritu Santo de Zúñiga to near Goliad in an attempt to Christianize and otherwise domesticate
the Aranama and Tamique (Ulrich et al. 2005). In 1754, Mission Nuestra Senora del Rosario was
established roughly four miles upstream on the San River from Mission Espiritu Santo. Mission
Rosario was founded to provide for the Copanos, Guapites, and Cujanes (Ramsdell 1934:17; Fox
2000). In 1793, Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio was founded at the confluence of the
Guadalupe and San Antonio rivers (Leffler 1996). However, Indian depredations caused the location
of this mission to be moved twice; the final site to be on the Mission River in what is now modernday Refugio. In 1830, the mission was closed, but by that time Mexican ranchos surrounded the area
(Tennis 2002).
In the early 1830s, colonists from Ireland, New York, and New Orleans were enticed to settle in the
area under empressario land contracts. During the Texas Revolution in 1835, residents of the area
were forced to flee to the east during the “Runaway Scrape”, and the Mexican town of La Bahia was
nearly destroyed.
Following the Civil War, the area’s economy was bolstered by cattle ranching and corn farming.
However, by 1900 the cattle industry had declined significantly. With the coming of railways in the
early 1900s, and a renewed cotton demand, cotton became the most predominate cash crop. In the
1920s, oil and gas were discovered in the area, and although somewhat diminished by the Great
Depression, production of oil and gas in the area has been a mainstay, and today is on a springboard
driving the economy of Nueces counties.

Site Types to be Expected within Nueces County
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Nueces County are prehistoric open campsites ranging
in age from the late Paleoindian period through the Historic period. Some of these represent a single
campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped for one night. Others are
very large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of people that stayed for long
periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these same campsites over a period
of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these large campsites include among
other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of
chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from making them, ground and smoothed stones
used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone
tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites occur in all types of environments,
11

whether that be in a plush riverine environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and
animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland
grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different food source that could be exploited such as various grass
seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts.
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are not a real common type of archaeological site that can be expected within Nueces
County. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that were left behind
when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The general absence of firecracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites suggest that they did not
camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time ( However, small camp fires may have
been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more knappable). Yet, they were
drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings or surface exposures of good
quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples of chipped stone most commonly
found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That
is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality of stone that could most easily be flaked
and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was useable
or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the
majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While
the finished stone tool products are carried away from these sites, what remains are those tools
broken during the manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of
flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped
‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a
transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further reduce it and make finished stone tools from the
flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not found on these sites because they
have been carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where raw material is not readily
available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left
behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found on
any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops that
were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried today, and
the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and lithic scatters in the Nueces
County area have been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
12

Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but differ
from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at times they
specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were not yet freed
from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types of sites are very rare
in the Central Texas Coast region for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not
present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up
gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone
remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well
as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are no documented burned rock middens in Nueces County. Burned rock middens result from
a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like modern-day roasting pits are
dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger rocks that serve as heating
elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a thermal source, they are
‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable, another is dug near by, and
the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked rocks
coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the formation of
burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et.
al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented at 30 sites within Nueces County
and are occasionally found elsewhere in the Central Texas Coast region. Individual and isolated
burials have been found in association with open campsites in both upland and coastal settings, as
well as in alluvial terraces along streams.
Shell Middens
As discussed in the “Cultural Chronology” section above, within an approximate 40-kilometer (25mile) zone from the modern Gulf Coast shoreline, archaeologists should expect to discover
prehistoric campsites where shellfish were exploited in abundance as a food source. As a result, the
thousands, or hundreds-of-thousands of shells were discarded, and over repeated usage, these sites
can be identified by layers of shell refuse sometimes as much as 1 to 2 meters in accumulated depth.
Although these refuse middens are more often than not directly associated with relative long-term
open campsites with campfire remains, bone, pottery, and chipped stone, because of the vast
accumulation of shell debris, archaeologists have tended to describe the overall site as a “shell
midden site”.
Historic Sites
Early explorers ventured into the area beginning in the 1500s, both the French and Spanish
established permanent structures in the region in the 17th and 18th centuries, and Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in the area by the early 19th century. Historic sites are not abundant,
but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to ranching and
farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types most commonly

houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or construction projects.

Nueces County History
Based upon artifacts discovered in Nueces County, it appears that humans may have occupied this
area as early as 8,000 years ago. Following that, the earliest known campsites indicating more stable
and permanent occupations can be dated to what is termed the Aransas culture, beginning roughly
4,000 years ago. The Aransas culture gave way to the Karankawas, about 1400 A.D. Karankawas,
Coahuiltecans, Lipan Apaches, and Tonkawas were those first encountered by Europeans explorers
and settlers in the 16th and 17th centuries. As with much of Texas, European contact with the
indigenous groups in Nueces County resulted in decimation of the Native Americans due to disease,
mixing among defined bands, tribes, and cultures, effectively eliminating previously existing
discrete and distinct groups (Long 1996).
The first European contact with the indigenous peoples of Nueces County ‘may’ have been made
by members of Alonso Álvarez de Pineda’s expedition as the Spanish sailed into Corpus Christi Bay
in 1519. Perhaps the most researched and published Spanish venture into what is now Nueces
County occurred in 1528 when Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his fellow crew members were
shipwrecked on the Texas coast. It is probable that de Vaca and his captors traveled through Nueces
County as they rounded the coastal inlands of Corpus Christi Bay. Presumably because of its
remoteness from inhabited Spanish holdings in what today is northern Mexico, the Nueces County
area was not of a matter of interest until the Spanish learned of a French presence, and the
establishment of a French colony and fort in the region in 1685 under René Robert Cavelier, Sieur
de La Salle (Fort La Salle). Upon learning of the French encroachment into Spanish territory,
Governor Alonso de León led an expedition to the fort but found it burned and abandoned. In 1747,
Captain Joaquin Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra departed from Presidio La Bahia at present-day
Goliad and explored the Nueces River to its mouth on Nueces Bay (Long 1996).
Under Spanish rule, large tracts of land were granted and ranching gained a foothold until 1812
when the Indians began raiding and pillaging. These depredations continued through 1824 when
a peace treaty was finally signed with the Comanches and Lipan Apaches. Under subsequent
Mexican rule, other large tracts of lands were again granted. Turmoil during the Texas Revolution
caused many landowners to flee the area, and following the revolution, both Texan and Mexican
raiding parties were at conflict within the county. At this time, both countries laid claim to the area
south and west of the Nueces River. In the meantime, illegal trading was prevalent within this
disputed territory, and the area’s ranches were virtually abandoned until after the Mexican War in
1845. During the Civil War, Corpus Christi emerged as a nucleus for Confederate trade. But Union
troops seized control of Mustang island in 1863, and bombarded Corpus Christi. Nevertheless,
unsanctioned trade goods were traveled via overland routes along the coast (Long 1996).
Following the Civil War, ranches with cattle, horses, and sheep bolstered the progressive economy
in Nueces County. In fact, Nueces County lead all other counties in Texas in the number of sheep
14

and cattle being raised, and the human population increased exponentially. In 1874, the Corpus
Christi sea channel was dredged to eight feet to allow for steamers to pass through it, and about the
same time a narrow-gauge rail line was constructed from Corpus Christi to Laredo. Another rail line,
the San Antonio and Aransas Pass, was completed in 1886 from Corpus Christi to San Antonio.
Cotton was the main cash crop through the early 20th century, but with large quantities of cabbage,
onions, spinach, carrots, cucumbers, and turnips being grown. In 1926 the Port of Corpus Christi
was opened. Cotton production waned through the 1940s, but peaked again in the late 1940s. As
with many counties in Texas, the discovery of oil and natural gas in Nueces County in the 1920s has
provided a generally stable economic stimuli. This stimuli is now peaking in the first quarter of the
21st century.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within each of the two counties, the results simply provide the data that is available.
In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon the
types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. That said, the data that is
available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the areas of the near coastal areas of Texas that the
surveys represent. Most of the near coastal areas of Texas have never been subjected to formal
cultural resource surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is
very poorly understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at least
some aspect of what the region looks like from an archaeological perspective.
Nueces County
As of January 14, 2016 there were 321 archaeological sites recorded in Nueces County. Of those,
229 are described as prehistoric open campsites, ranging in age from the Paleoindian through Late
Prehistoric periods. Shell middens are present on 26 of the 229 open campsites, and human burial
remains have been found at 31 of the campsites. In addition, there are five shell middens, and four
sites with human remains that are not directly associated with open campsites. Lithic scatters are
fairly rare in Nueces County, probably in part due to the paucity of quality raw material in the area.
To date, there have been only 18 archaeological sites that can be classified as lithic scatters. Nueces
County is blessed with an abundance of historical components - 43 recorded thus far. These include
an early 19th century river crossing of the El Camino Real, a Spanish Colonial ranch headquarters,
General Zachary’s camp dating to 1845, an 1800s school house site, Mexican-era sites, and early
to mid-20th century farmsteads and trash scatters, as well as many others. State Archeological
Landmarks documented within the county include 27 shipwrecks, the Fort Lipantitlan and MexicanTexan site, the Oso Lake Midden site with human burials, the San Antonio and Aransas canal and
causeway, the Old Bayview Cemetery, the Nueces County Courthouse in Corpus Christi, and a
variety of other very interesting sites (Atlas 2016).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical framework
is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the regions.
The historic framework is structured around the 1800s and 1900s settlement in the area as
documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests, government representatives, and
early Anglo-American settlers, through the Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty periods, and
into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort

The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, and thorough pedestrian survey of the linear rights-ofway (1,368 meters) was conducted. Working around flooded and muddied areas, as they were able,
two archaeologists meandered back and forth across the 24-meter wide (80-foot) rights-of-way to
ensure more complete coverage. Surface visibility ranged from 60 to 100 percent (see for example,
cover photo).
A single shovel test was excavated along the ship channel shoreline where surface visibility was
approximately 60 percent. All machine cutbanks, and backdirt piles along the rights-of-way were
thoroughly examined. In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural material of a
redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be
fully documented via sketches, field photographs, and copious notes.
Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be
considered as significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian
transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that
decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist. Historic

16

buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences adjacent to the ROW were to be documented
with photographs and included in this report of investigations.
The single shovel test was dug in 20-centimeter (cm) levels, and all sediments were screened
through 1/4-inch wire mesh. Following our designed research plan, any artifacts recovered from
shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 20 cm of the backfilled
shovel test. The results of shovel testing were fully documented on a Shovel Test form, and the
results are summarized below. The shovel test location was mapped using a hand-held GPS.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
As shown in Figure 10, the
terrestrial Project Area evolved
above the Nueces Bay floor in the
1960s, and is composed of clay,
silt, sand, and shells presumably
dredged from the adjacent Viola
Ship Channel. As such, one would
not expect to discover intact, wellstratified, and potentially
significant cultural deposits that
had been dredged and re-deposited.
However, Tierras Antiguas
archaeologists were also attuned to
the potential for human remains
from both prehistoric contexts as
well as from 1900s hurricanes that
could have been re-deposited
within the Project Area.
Nevertheless, the surface survey
conducted by Tierras Antiguas
archaeologists on January 13, 2016
revealed no evidence of either
prehistoric or historic cultural
materials. Instead, it was readily
apparent that the entire Project
Area was very heavily disturbed,
with little if any potential for intact Figure 10. Aerial photo of Project Area.

the Project Area on
January 13, we observed that a bore drilling rig, along with associated support buildings and
vehicles were in place and active at the proposed bore hole location on the north side of Joe Fulton
Corridor (Figures 10 and 11). Subsequent queries with the Gravity Midstream Product Pipelines
Project Manager revealed that the boring activities in process were not those of Gravity Midstream,
but were those of a separate company. Nevertheless, our surface observation around the bore hole
locale revealed no evidence of cultural material.
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists then focused our examination on the larger portion of the Project
Area between the Joe Fulton Corridor and the Viola Ship Channel. As shown in Figures 12-20, the
entire area had been heavily disturbed, and no evidence of cultural material was observed.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
The entire Project Area consisted of soils classified as ‘Made Land’. Surface visibility within the
Project Area ranged from roughly 60 to 100 percent. Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a
thorough pedestrian survey on January 13, 2016 and excavated one shovel test along the ship
channel shoreline where surface visibility was approximately 60 percent.
No evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural material was observed within the Project Area.
As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Gravity Midstream Product Pipelines
through the Port Authority of Corpus Christi-owned property should be allowed to proceed as
currently designed. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties
considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the
State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be allowed to proceed
without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.
