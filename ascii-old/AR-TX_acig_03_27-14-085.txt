Abstract
On February 22, 2016, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural resources
survey for the proposed Nameless Substation Expansion project in Travis County, Texas.
The Pedernales Electrical Coop (CEP) Nameless Substation Expansion is part of a larger
project being conducted by the Brushy Creek Regional Utility Authority (BCRUA), who is
developing a deep water intake structure to ensure the availability of a reliable water
supply for the BCRUA Regional Water System. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the
Antiquities Permit consists of the 0.4-acre review area to the east of the existing
Nameless Substation.
The survey did not result in the locat ion of any new archeological sites, historic
structures, or any addit ional historic propert ies. Based on these results, no further
archeological work is recommended. Records from this investigat ion will be curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Julie Shipp served as Principal Invest igator.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
On February 22, 2016, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural resources
survey of the proposed Nameless Substation Expansion project in Travis County, Texas.
The PEC Nameless Substation Expansion is part of a larger project being conducted by
the Brushy Creek Regional Utility Authority (BCRUA), who is developing a deep water
intake structure to ensure the availability of a reliable water supply for the BCRUA
Regional Water System. As described in the BCRUA Phase II Deep Water Intake
Environmental Assessment Supplement to Volume 2, the preferred alternative
(Alternative 8) includes an intake assembly at the mouth of the Sandy Creek arm of
Lake Travis, a maintenance building at Site 4 in the Village of Volente, a pump station
at Sandy Creek Park at Site 8 (Pump Station), and a tunneled pipeline from the deep
water intake assembly to the Pump Station and to the Phase I raw water pipeline on
Trails End Road.
The existing electrical infrastructure capacity is currently inadequate to power the
Pump Station; for the project to be viable, additional electrical capacity must be
provided. Four alternative alignments originating at four different Pedernales Electrical
Coop (PEC) electrical substations have been proposed to provide the additional
electrical capacity:
• Lago Vista Substation west of the Pump Station, which has four proposed
routes;
• Balcones Substation east of Pump Station;
• Nameless Substation north of the Pump Station, which has two proposed
routes; and
• Buttercup Substation northeast of the Pump Station.
For the Nameless Substation alignment to be a viable alternative, the substation
requires expansion. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of the 0.4-acre APE to
the east of the existing Nameless Substation (Figures 1 and 2).
The project will be funded through the BCRUA, thus the project is conducted in
compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code as well as Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, for any additional compliance for
impacts to US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) regulated waters. The investigat ion
will consist of an intensive pedestrian survey, shovel testing, site recording, assessment
of sites for listing on the national Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation

as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), data analysis, and reporting in accordance with
THC and Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) standards.
No archeological sites were recorded during the survey and no previously recorded
archaeological sites, cemeteries, NRHP properties, SALs, or Registered Texas Historic
Landmarks (RTHLs) were identified during the background review. As such, the
following report is presented in the short report format defined by the CTA for small
projects with negative results.

2.0 BACKGROUND REVIEW
A literature review of the THC Archeological Sites Database (the Atlas) revealed that no
previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted and no previous archeological
sites have been recorded within the APE. Furthermore, no previously recorded sites are
within one kilometer of the APE (Figure 3). The nearest recorded site is approximately
three kilometers to the northwest. The site is one of nine sites reported by Kutscher
Ranch and recorded by archeologists from the THC.
The soils within the APE are mapped as Brackett-Rock outcrop complex, Tarrant and
Volente (NRCS 2014). All of the soils formed in situ over limestone. Brackett soils are
shallow, gravelly, calcareous, loamy soils overlying interbedded limestone and marl.
Tarrant soils are very shallow, stony, calcareous, clayey soils intermingled with shallow
soils overlying limestone. Volente silty clay loam is deeper than the other two soils but
also formed on sloping uplands (Figure 4).

3.0 FIELD METHODS
A pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate any archeological sites or other
historical properties that may be adversely affected by construction. The pedestrian
survey was conducted within the entire APE. Shovel testing was not required due to
good ground surface visibility (ranging from approximately 30-50 percent), shallow and
eroded soils at the surface, and prior disturbance from the construction of pond (Figure
5).
4.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
The survey was conducted under pleasant conditions in the morning, under a partly
cloudy sky. The topography is gently sloped downward toward the narrow Nameless
Hollow Creek. The vegetation within the APE consisted primarily of ashe juniper and
oak trees, with some prickly pear and mixed grasses. Ground surface visibility was
generally good and ranged from 30 - 50 percent (Figure 6).
The majority of the APE has been disturbed from the channelization of Nameless
Hollow Creek and the construction of a detention pond. Naturally occurring chert
gravels and cobbles were observed scattered across the surface of the APE, however,
none of the materials appeared to be worked and no cultural materials were found
during the survey.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural resources survey for the
proposed Nameless Substation Expansion project in Travis County, Texas. The
Nameless Substation Expansion is part of a larger project being conducted by the
Brushy Creek Regional Utility Authority (BCRUA), who is developing a deep water
intake structure to ensure the availability of a reliable water supply for the BCRUA
Regional Water System. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of the 0.4-acre
tract to the east of the existing Nameless Substation.
No archaeological sites were recorded during the survey and no previously recorded
archaeological sites, cemeteries, NRHP properties, SALs, or RTHLs were identified
during the background review. Based on these results, no further archeological work is
recommended. If any cultural resources are observed during the course of construct ion
for this project, the BCRUA is advised to contact a professional archeologist.
