ABSTRACT
Duping Oatober, NovembeX', .and Deaember of 1977, and
Januapy, .1978, the Te:cas Arahe.ologiaal Survey, The University
of Te:cas at Austin,'aonduated areaonnaissanaesuzavey. of
seleated areas within the wateI'~hed of Cypress Cpeek, Waller
and Harris aounties:lTe:cas.Thi.s reaonnaissanae, aarried out
under terms of a aontraat award from the Galveston Distriat,
Corps of Engineers:l was initiated with the intention of loaating,
desaribing, and assessing the. signifiaanae of araheologiaal
and histo:z>iaal :z>esouraes,with a depth of study neaessary for
prepartion of a "prediative drainage basin model" to be used
by the Galveston Distriat in aonneation wi.th possible future
flood aontrol modifiaation in the Cypress Creek basin. The
size of the basin . (approximately B20square miles, i~aluding
an 80 square-mile, 100 year flood plain) preaZuded extensive,
basin-wide sampUng at this time.
However, sinae flood aontrol
aativities would likely be restriated primarily to the 100 year
flood p lain of Cypress Creek, a re lative ly extensive samp ling
of the flood plain and immediately aontiguous uplands was
imp lemented.
.
A mathematiaally-based sampling model Was designed to sample
20% of the 100 yeap flood plain. To a far lesser areal extent:l
some reaonnaissanae oaaurred outside of the seleated areas.
Araheologiaal investigations herein reported resulted in the
disaovery or reevaluation of 58 prehistoria sites. Systematia
surfaae inspeation, shovel testing, and aonsultation with loaal
informants, were used to identify these sites. The goal of
this projeat was not only to identify and loaate prehistoria
sites, but also to formulate an estimate of prehistoria site
frequenay for the enti"Je,~a'l'eaL')tjfJaanaern.
Methods for loaating historia sites.inaluded interviews
with loaal informants, assessments of files at the Texas Historiaal
Commission, use of state and loaal arahives in Austin and Houston,
and fieZd inspeation in the watershed and 100 year flood plain.
Twenty-five historic sites were identified and recorded.
Data
aoncerning 22 more sites known to be in the area but not speaifi­
cally loaated during the month for field work, wezoecacaumulated.
On the basis of the preliminary 20% sample:l it is possible
to conalude that there is a relatively high density of prehistoric
sites within the study area -a higher density than was anticipated.
No standing historic structures of National Register signifiaanae
were found.
However, severaZ areas are alearly sensitive, and
a number of archeologiaal sites identified are deemed potentially
important.
It is aoncluded that their relative value may be
determined only at the aonclusion of more intensive, site-speaifia
testing.
Suggestions for future actions to be taken prior to
structural modifiaation in the Cypress Creek area are offered.

PREFACE
This report represents the response of th~ ~exas
Atcheological Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, to
a request by the Galveston District, Corps of Engineers,
for a preliminary inventory and assessment of the cultural
resources (archeological and historical) present in the
Cypress Creek basin.
This need for information was
generated by present considerations, now being given by the
Corps of Engineers, to possible flood contro~ measures in
the Cypress Creek drainage.
Although the nature of any
structural flood control activities, if any, has not been
decided upon, these data will hopefully be of value in future
project environmental ~mpact evaluations.
It is the writer's ~pinion that prelimary assessmencs
at such an early stage of project conception are highly
desirable as it is then that the most prudent management of
potentially important cultural resources can be implemented.

A PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF THE
PREHISTORIC RESOURCES OF CYPRESS CREEK

Introduction
A survey and assessment of the archeological resources
of Cypress Creek t in Waller and Harris Counties, Texas, was
accomplished with respect to a scope of work presented to the
University of Texas at Austin by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers t Galveston District.
This reconnaissance was undertaken in response to flood
control studies of a preliminary nature.
Future modifications
of the creek channel may be called for as a protective measure
against the flooding of countless susceptible homes.
This
susceptability is complicated by the fact that this region
is in the fastest growing urban area in the United States
today.
Eventually the land bordering the creek will be packed
with homes needing security from high water.
The scope of work called for the study to be confined to
the defined basin of Cypress Creek and to be most intensive
within the 100 year flood limits of this stream: the area of
potential flood control modifications.
The field work began in the latter part of October and
was scheduled for completion by mid-December.
When the work
was completed, 58 prehistoric sites had been recorded.
Of
this number, five had been previously recorded by amateurs.
One of these sites, 41 HR 315, had been partially excavated
by the Houston Archeological Society in the summer of 1977.
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Culturally speaking, Cypress Creek flows through an area
which is generally described as "undefined" (Suhm, Krieger
and Jelks 1954: 230-231).
Cypress Creek does lie within the
bounds of one archeologically defined unitt the LaHarpe
Aspect (Johnson 1962: 268).
This Archaic pattern is fairly

3

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

widespread geographically in East Texas and parts of neigh­
boring states.
Other cultural units which are probably
associated with the project area are the Central Texas Aspect
to the northwest and the Rockport and Galveston Foci to the
south (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1054: 231).
Shafer (1974; Shafer, Baxter, Stearns and Dering 1975:
13-22; Shafer and Stearns 1975: 8-11) has recently attempted
to establish a chronology for the prehistoric populations of
southeast Texas.
It is anticipated that Aten (Ph.D. dissert­
ation in preparation) will present an updated synthesis of
chronological sequences applicable to the Upper Gulf Coast
of Texas.
Prior to the Cypress Creek Survey very little archeological
investigation had taken place in the immediate vicinity of the
watershed.
Five prehistoric sites had been recorded by amateurs
within the 320 square mile basin.
Of ,these, one site (41 HR 315)
was salvage excavated by a well-respected amateur archeologist,
Leland Patterson.
Naturally, the results of his workb the only
systematic excavation within the watershed, should be carefully
scrutinized before further endeavors take place in the immediate
area (Patterson ms. in preparation).
To the north of the project area, several important surveys
and subsequent excavations have recovered cultural material
similar to that from Cypress Creek.
These studies were under­
taken in the Livingston Reservoir in Polk and San Jacinto
Counties (McClurkin 1967, 1968), the San Jacinto River basin
in Montgomery County (Shafer 1968) and the Sam Houston National
Park in Walker County (McNatt 1978).
Some 10 miles to the south of Cypress Creek, in the Addicks
Dam Reservoir, Joe Ben Wheat (1953) carried out one of the most
important archeological investigations in southeast Texas.
This study is of interest, not only because of its close geo­
graphical location, but also because the material recovered
there bears a strong resemblance to that from Cypress Creek.
Further to the south of the project Clrea, there haye b.=e.=ec-"n'--__
numerous surveys and excava tions ...... One· or· the best studied
areas is the Wallisville Reservoir in Chambers County (Shafer
1966; Tunnell and Ambler 1967; Ambler 1970; Gilmore 1974;
Dillehay 1975).
Others are the Jamison Site (Aten 1967) and

'--­

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

the Price Daniel Site (Malone 1969) in Liberty County, the
Caplen Site (Campbell 1957) in Galveston County, Cedar Bayou
(Ambler 1967), Armand Bayou (Hole et aZ 1974), Harris County
Boys' School Cemetary (Aten et aZ 1976) and the studies along
White Oak Bayou by Payne (1973) and McClure (series of articles
in the Houston Archeological Society Newsletter), all of which
are in Harris County.
In Brazoria County, Aten (1971)
excavated the Dow-Cleaver Site, and Fritz (1975) surveyed
the Matagorda Bay area in Calhoun County.
Farther to the
southwest a number of intensive studies have been done in
Jackson County, especially dealing with the Palmetto Bend
Reservoir (Story 1968; Wakefield 1968; Mallouf et aZ 1973;
McGuff 1978; Fawcett ms. in preparation).
Finally, the exca­
vations at AlIens Creek (Hall in press) in Austin County should
be mentioned.
Few areas to the north of Cypress Creek have undergone
intensive archeological research, while a far greater number
of projects have taken place to the south (many of which are
not cited here).
This is unfortunate for comparisons with
Cypress Creek because the cultural settlement patterns, arti­
fact assemblages, and geographic locations exhibited by those
sites near the coast are vastly different from those same
traits observed at inland sites along Cypress Creek.
This is
not to say no comparisons can be made; but the Cypress Creek
area is viewed as a transitional zone between the coastal
region and the inland areas.
LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION OF ENVIRONMENT
Cypress Creek lies north-northwest of Houston, Texas,
approximately sixty miles from the Gulf of Mexico (Fig. 1).
The creek originates in Waller County from the union of two
smaller drainages, Snake and Mound Creeks.
Beginning in the
general vicinity of Waller, Texas, these creeks trend south
for about eight miles; at their confluence the stream is
termed Cypress Creek.
From this point, Cypress Creek flows
54.2 miles across northern Harris County to a juncture with
Spring Creek three miles west of the San Jacinto River.
Cypress Creek lies in the environmental zone known as
the West Gulf Coastal Plain (Fenneman 1938: 100) which extends
from the Mississippi Alluvial Plain southwest to Mexico.
Its
northern boundary follows the Balcones Escarpment as far in­

5

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

land as the Ouachita Mountain province in Arkansas and Okla­
homa.
This report focuses on a subdivision of this larger
area, a 50 to 75 mile wide belt called the Coastal Lowlands
(Fenneman 1938: 112).
Topography
The general topography of the area consists of flat to
moderately rolling plains gently sloping towards the Gulf of
Mexico, with a network of creeks and associated gullies afford­
ing only minor fluctuations in elevation.
The usually wide
valleys of this network are encompassed by low ridges with
naturally occurring levees.
Pock marks are numerous along the coastal plain and seem
to have evolved through the processes of erosion and deposition.
Bernard and LeBlanc (1965: 171) describe these features as
"very small, circular shaped depressions or intermittent lakes!!.
The pock marks are a result of the abandonment of river/stream
channels or depressions formed by aeolian blow-outs.
The water
retention capabilities of these pock marks grant them prominence
as a topographic feature despite their small size.
Mounds and pimple mounds are also associated with the flat
plain.
The pimple mounds, as described by Bernard and LeBlanc
(1965: 174-176) and as investigated by McGuff and Cox (1973:
62-72), are one of the more puzzling features of the coastal
plain.
These small circular or oblong mounds, ranging in height
from % 6 inches to ± 5 feet, and in diameter from ~5 feet to
±200 feet, are numerous and wide-spread.
The genesis of the
mounds has been~various1y attributed to erosion, differential
erosion around clumps of vegetation, ant or gopher activity, and
sand dunes.
Any patterning of the mounds associated with the
Cypress Creek drainage is difficult to discern.
Mounds occur
on the open prairie, or under the cover of dense vegetation in
the forest, with no apparent consistent correlation to stream
courses.
McGuff and Cox (1973: 71) feel that "mounds of this
type may result from a number of geneses which despite their
differences culminate in similar geomorphic features".
Dr.
Edward Garner and Dr. R.S. Kier (Personal Communication),
geologists of the Bureau of Economic Geology, The University
of Texas at Austin, believe that the mounds are the result of
large rodent/gopher populations, and that the mounds are being
formed even today.

6

ENVIRONMENT

Larger mounds are far fewer in number, but they can be
prominent features on the flat plain.
Only two mounds are
located in the project area, the Hockley Mound and the Hockley
salt dome.
Of the two, only the Hockley Mound (just to the
east of Mound Creek) is of any topographic significance.
Even though it rises a mere thirty feet above the plain, it
is a landmark easily recognizable from a distance of several
miles.
Many local "old-timers" have expressed the view that
the mound has decreased in size during their lifetimes.
The Hockley scarp dominates the features of the coastal
plain in the precincts of Cypress Creek.
According to Kreitler
(1967b: 13), the scarp in northwest Harris County rises 45
feet in elevation within a distance of about one mile.
This
seaward-facing scarp can be seen several miles north of Cypress
Creek.
Barton (1930: 1302) traces the scarp "from south Texas,
north of Eagle Lake, south of Sealy, past the Hockley salt
dome and Tomball, south of Conroe, past Cleveland, Warren and
Kirbyville and eastward into Louisiana".
He futher states
that "no scarp comparable with the Hockley scarp lies between
it and the present shore line, although a faint scarp is
present at the 100-foot contour near Addicks in Harris County".
No doubt, the Hockley scarp has affected the morphology of
the Cypress Creek drainage.
Drainage
Cypress Creek drains an area of about 320 square miles
and is classified as lying within the San Jacinto River basin.
Numerous small creeks and gullies regularly empty into Cypress
Creek.
Some of the more notable are Little Cypress Creek, Dry
Creek, Faulkey Gully, Pillo t G1.111y, Theiss Gully ,Se als Gully.
Lemm Gully, Wild Cow Gulch, and Turkey Creek.
All of these
creeks and gullies, with the exception of Turkey .Creek, drain
land which is to the north of Cypress Creek.
Consequently,
the overwhelming amount of land in the Cypress Creek watershed
is north of the main stem.
The drainage pattern of Cypress Creek is atypical of
fluvial systems on the coastal plain.
The norm for the region
is for streams to follow a generally southeasterly course, but
Cypress Creek flows northeasterly.

7

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

--------------------------------------------------Geology

The sediments of the study area are of Pleistocene
and Holocene (Recent) age.
The plain through which Cypress
Creek flows was developed from fluvial deposits (St. Clair
et aZ 1975) resulting from major river systems interacting
with coastal mechanics (Bernard and LeBland 1965: 138) during
a time of high sea level in the Pleistocene.
Three Pleistocene and one Recent fluvial terrace deposit
were mapped in the survey area (Barnes 1968a, 1968b; Kier
et aZ 1977). These deposits are, respectively, the Willis
Formation, Bentley or Lower Lissie Formation, Montgomery or
Upper Lissie Formation, and the Recent Alluvium.
Dubar and
Clopine (1961: 83) stated that "formation names are as plen­
tiial as -investigators who have worked in:~the area and....t.~e~
is no agreeinen t i n de finitTonor-~recognition of units within
the Pleistocene section~.
For these reasons, general labeling
and location of formations are utilized for this report.
The Willis Formation, oldest of the four formations ment­
ioned above, is commonly exposed in the northwestern part of
the watershed.
The Hockley scarp separates it from the younger
Bentley and Montgomery Formations.
It typically has a gently
rolling surface, as seen in the area of Snake and Mound Creeks,
and is characterized by such geomorphic features as Hockley
Mound and the Hockley salt dome.
This unit contains clay,
silt, sand (coarser than younger units), small amounts of sil­
icious gravel and petrified wood ranging from granule to pebble
size, and numerous iron oxide concretions (Barnes 1968a, 1968b).
The slightly younger Bentley Formation underlies a very
gently rolling plain and occurs in the westernmost portion of
the watershed.
Clay, silt, sand, minor amounts of silicious
gravel and iron oxide concretions are its dominant components
(Barnes 1968a, 1968b).
Cypress Creek cuts its channel almost entirely through
the Montgomery Formation, where the bulk of the survey was
undertaken.
The surface is fairly flat and featureless except
for numerous pimple mounds and rounded shallow depressions.
This unit is composed of clay, silt, sand, some silicious
gravel of granule to pebble size, and concretions of calcium
carbonate, iron oxide and iron-manganese oxides (Barnes 1968a,
1968b).

As previously stated, Cypress Creek is atypical of creeks
on the coastal plain because it flows in a northeasterly rather
than southeasterly direction.
The controlling factor or factors
for this orientation are not precisely known but its course
is probably affected by the Hockley scarp.
Cypress Creek gen­
erally parallels the Hockley scarp, slightly to the south.
This scarp is one of the more dominant features of the coastal
plain.
It has been described as a possible fault escarpment,
an erosional phenomenon, or a depositional feature.
Kreitler
(1976b: 13) suggests the first hypothesis. His documentation
of recent faulting is seen in lithe breakup of U.S. Highway
290 where it crosses the escarpment and the differential sub­
sidence profile which crosses the escarpment".
This theory
is partially substantiated by the fact that the Hockley scarp
lies along the great thickening of the Oligocene-Miocene-·
Pleistocene section. Kreitler (1976b:5) maps numerous faults
south of Cypress Creek and north of the so-called Addicks
scarp. Although they are extrapolated subsurface faults
(not active at present), their importance in the past may be
determinable by the relationship of their lineations to the
course of the creek. Based upon its rectilinear drainage
pattern, it is fairly safe to assume that Cypress Creek, like
its neighboring drainages, is structurally controlled.
Flora
Blair (1950: 98) has indicated that the Cypress Creek
watershed is situated in the Austroriparian biotic province
of Texas.
According to Tharp (1939: 7) it is situated in
the Coastal Prairie vegetational region of Texas.
These
districts encompass vast amounts of land which are stratified
into numerous variations of vegetational types.
Three of
these variations are found within the Cypress Creek study area;
the upland prairie, the coastal prairie, and the piney-hardwood
(Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept. 1968: 2, 1969: 17) (Fig. 2).
In the survey area the upland prairie occurs only above
the source of Cypress Creek in Waller County, and in the far
northwestern tip of Harris County in close relation to the
soils of the Willis Formation.
Some shrubs and a few trees
were noted here during the survey.
Postoak, hackberry, and
eastern red cedar are indigenous to the upland prairie.
Heavy grazing of the area has no doubt effected tree populations.

9

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

Shrubs, such as the Macartney rose, huisache, pricklyash, and
mesquite, are more numerous, in many cases as a result of
growth along fence lines and ditches.
Grass is by far the most
dominant variety of vegetation.
Common types of grasses are
little bluestem, Florida paspalum, vine mesquite, sand dropseed,
sand lovegrass, red lovegrass and sandburr (Texas Parks and
Wildlife Dept., 1969: 18).
The coastal prairie vegetation type covers the majority of
land in the watershed.
It is integrally related to soils common
to the Lissie Formations. Agri~ult6reis haa_ilp concentrated
within this vegetation zone with rice being the main product.
Land not under cultivation can support a variety of grasses,
such as little bluestem, Texas grama grass, buffalograss, threeawn,
brownseed paspalum, gulf muhly, resceregrass and bermudagrass.
The coastal prairie can support limited numbers of hardwoods
along the streams, the predominant types being liveoak and
hackberry.
Timber clearing has reduced their habitat to the
immediate area of Cypress Creek, and has completely eliminated
them in some situations.
A large stand of liveoaks survive
where Cypress Creek crosses the line between Harris and Waller
Counties.
This example of an unspoiled area is locally known
as "Liveoak".
Shrubs are the only large vegetation allowed to
encroach into the prairie.
Once again, they follow fence lines
and ditches.
The common types on the coastal prairie are Mac­
artney rose, mesquite, pricklyash, huisache and baccaris (Texas
Parks and Wildlife Dept •. 1968: 9, 1969: 17).
The piney-hardwood vegetation found in the Cypress Creek
watershed is an appendage of the East Texas Piney Woods which
protrudes into the coastal prairie.
Since this is a trans­
itional zone, plant communities are heavily mixed (Fig. 2).
The soils primarily associated with this extension are Recent
Alluvial deposits.
The vegetation is greatly dependant on
Cypress Creek, which permits the forest vegetation to encroach
upon the prairie. A number of species make up the overstory
population of the piney-hardwood type.
The short leaf pine,
loblolly pine with a liberal mixture of oak, hickory, bitter
pecan, magnolia, ash, and hackberry are dominant.
These trees
are to be found in fairly well drained soils while the more
poorly drained soils support water-tolerant hardwoods.
Common
to this environment are the water oak, willow oak, white oak,
sweetgum, and cypress.
Cypress trees are found in isolated
low-lying areas, usually in old cutoff meanders, and along the
creek with an increased density toward the confluence with Spring

Creek.
Complex patterns are seen throughout this vegetation
zone.
Fluctuations between pine and hardwood dominance are
common.
Frequently, pure hardwood stands are encountered.
Understory populations vary in intensity (Fig. 3).
Some
stands are impenetrable.
Stands can be made up of one or a
number of species.
Common plants are yaupon, Kentucky vir­
bnrnium, grape, greenbriars, yellow jessamine, poison ivy,
vaxmyrtle, hawthorn and French mulberry.
Ground cover is
usually total.
Forbs such as ragweed, doveweed, and smartweed
are common.
Bermuda grass and Texas needlegrass are the
dominant grasses (Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept. 1968: 3-4).
Fauna
Blair (1950: 99) states that "at least 47 species of mammals
occur in the Austroriparian biotic province in Texas or have
occurred there in recent times.
At least 29 species of snakes,
10 liz~tdsid.wo2la~dl.udtle$~lii,addroms,nandni' andd6ls are
known".
The animal habitats within the proj ect area lj ave been
severely threatened, and in some cases, almost eradicated by
the ressures of urbanizati~'l!pon t:h~~rural env~~~_. .~
Animals encountered during the survey included turtles,
fresh water mussels, froB~r' skunks, opossums, raccoons, small
rodents, rabbits, armadillos, numerous small birds, egrets,
herons, cranes, hawks, a number of non-poisonous and poisonous
snakes (water moccasins and copperheads), quail, dove~,?phea8an~s,
and thousands of geese andkaucks.
Deer signs were evident
throughout the forest, especially in the area known as "Liveoak",
but deer tracks also were seen in the middle of fields far from
any cover.
It is difficult to determine whether or not present
vegetation patterns and habitats accurately reflect the past
environment which supported prehistoric occupation.
Through
agriculture, grazing, post-Civil War logging, urbanization,
changes in flooding patterns, and pollution, the flora of
Cypress Creek and its surrounding areas has surely been changed.
On the other:hand, it is felt that the faunal assemblage was
basically the same, with some exceptions, in prehistoric times.
Faunal habitats and actual numbers of animals have shown the
greatest change over time.
Within a few years certain animal
species will no doubt completely disappear from the area.

ENVIRONMENT

Climate
Blair (1942: 191) describes the West Gulf Coastal Plain
as having a subtropical climate, hot in summer and cool in
winter.
The summer can be unbearably hot with a high relative
humidity and with temperatures averaging around 83 0 F.(Carr
1967: 8).
Temperatures above 100 0 F. are quite common,
especially during the months of July and August.
On the other hand, winters are usually mild with an
average temperature of about 56 0 F. (Carr 1967: 8).
Relatively
few freezes occur, and snow and sleet are rare.
The coldest
month of the year is usually January.
The Upper Gulf Coast region has one of the highest levels
of precipitation in the state with an annual mean of 46.2 inches.
The two highest monthly averages fall within the hottest and
coldest months (Carr 1967: 7).
During the hottest months,
fluctuations in conjunction with the gulf environment cause
numerous thunderstorms.
The summer's end is the time for
tropical storms and hurricanes, which account for the high
precipitation level observed from July to September.
Isolated
thunderstorms move into and out of the area rapidly, but
thunderstorms related to intense weather systems can be very
severe.
Large amounts of rain can cause dangerously high
flood levels.
Further complications can occur with hurricane­
related thunderstorms. Gale force winds usually are somewhat
subdued this far inland, but it is the storm aftermath that
brings tornadoes and their destructive forces.
December has the second highest rainfall on the Upper
Coast (Carr 1967: 7). Winter weather system, ~~ming from
the north, bring rain that can last for days at a time.
Although individual storms usually are not very forceful,
flooding may occur when a succession of fronts come into
the area and stagnate, saturating the soil.
ASBEtTS OF LAND MODIFICATION
U.S. Highway 290 serves as a dividing line between two
distinct fypesoef~areasr.eaified by man within the Cypress
Creek watershed.
Farming and the rural community largely
dominate ihnd use to the west of the highway, while to the

15

-----

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

east, control is largely in the hands of land developers and
the urban community (Fig. 4).
Farming and the Rural Community
West of the intersection of Cypress Creek and U.S. Highway
290 there are farms, large ranches, small towns, and minimal
residential development.
Though sparsely populated, vast
amounts of land have been severely altered by farming and
ranching activities, which have caused topographic changes.
By the time of the Civil War, extensive grazing had taken place,
and in the 1930's large-scale rice farming was initiated. (See
Part II, this report).
The years of plowing and leveling of
the land for rice fields (this is one of the most productive
rice-growing areas in the state) have almost completely oblit­
erated the once-prolific pimple mounds and natural low spots
indigenous to this plain. There are now numerous contiguous
large tracts of land which are virtually flat except for occas­
ional stock tanks, reservoirs and drainage ditches.
Disposal
areas are also recent additions to the topographic situation.
Drainage patterns along this stretch have also been
changed.
Interacting forces seen in the formation of straight
canals for qUick release of water, large water storage areas
(reservoirs and rice fields), and the straightenin'g of the
channel have all contributed to Cypress Creek's new appearance.
Modifications to the channel were done by the Harris County
Flood Control District.
Before the transformations, the creek
was a slowly meandering stream incapable of moving large
quantities of water swiftly.
Geologically speaking, faulting may occur as a direct _
result of the extraction of water (primarily), and oil or gas
from below the surface.
This fluid withdrawal is followed by
land subsidence which in many cases is integrally related to
faulting.
The impact of subsidence on the area has no great
immediate effect, but the long-range outcome (change in drainage
and habitation patterns) is significant.
Physiographic modification of the prairie is evidenced
by the transformation of vegetal and animal populations.
Agri­
culture has been responsible for the removal of the prairie
grass and for its replacement with rice, cotton, soybeans, and
other crops.
In addition, large trees and shrubs are now

16

LAND MODIFICATION

restricted to the immediate vicinity of the creek, and to areas
along fences or adjacent to homes and buildings.
The vegetation
of the creek environment is in part a result of channel dred­
ging.
The animal population has suffered in some ways and
has prospered in others.
It is obvious that few large species
such as deer and wolf can now survive on the open land.
Their numbers are limited by the lack of cover, the manipul­
ation of the ground surface, and the constant presence of man.
Even smaller animals are constantly threatened and have only
limited areas of habitation.
Agriculture is not totally destructive to animal pop­
ulationS. With the advent of crops such as rice, ~cores of
birds, especially ducks and geese, have an abundant food
supply.
Many of the migratory birds which previously occupied
low-lying marshy areas near the coast are now found on the open
prairie.
The Urban Area
East of the point where Cypress Creek and U.S. Highway
290 intersect is a world completely different from that of
the west side (Fig. 4).
Almost overnight this area has been
transformed from a quiet, rural,~forestdd~a~ea into the fastest
growing urban area in the United States.
The substantial land
modification that has taken place here is primarily the devel­
opment of residential subdivisions. Low-cost projects have
become crowded with homes, thus permitting only minimal preser­
vation of original vegetation and topography. High-cost sub­
divisions, with larger building lots, have been much less
destructive to the native flora.
Residential developments do not always denote a negative
impact on archeological remains.
Such projects can be some­
what helpful in locating prehistoric sites.
Due to vegetation
densities and the lack of prominent topographical features,
it is virtually impossible to use normal survey techniques to
locate sites away from the immediate creek environment. Land
clearing and road cutting during the inital phase of develop­
ment may expose cultural material which might otherwise have
gone unnoticed (Fig. 5).
One disadvantage is that the Jrche­
ologists~ must be present at the time or be fortunate enough

to be informed by local amateurs or collectors before further
development continues.
The second most notable aspect of modification of the
environment is the county flood control action carried out
on Cypress Creek and many of its small tributaries.
Before
work was done in the early 1950's, Cypress Creek was a small,
rather insignificant stream, much like several of the unaltered
larger gullies that run into it today.
The creek has been
enlarged to two to three times its original size and has become
a formidable stream (Fig. 6).
Modifications to the creek begin at Tettar'Ceme..tie.:r:..y Road
and continue uninterrupted westward to the county line.
Existing
alterations to natural conditions as a result of the county flood
control project consist of the removal of vegetation which once
bordered or was within the old channel, the cutting of a new
channel bottom with a back slope ratio. of 2:1, the formation
of disposal areas up to a height of 8 feet on both sides of the
creek, the cutting off of numerous dammed up meanders which now
form small oxbow lakes, and the required continual brush clear­
ing from within the channel.
To obtain an idea of the magnitude
of change, one may view the cutoff meander which remains active
with the runoff from Seals Gully.
Though part of the meander
is now an extension of Seals Gully, it provides an example of
the basic dimensions and characteristics of the old Cypress Creek.
There are many factors contingent upon modification.
Growth
of understory populations forms a new barrier between creek and
forest.
The impenetrable briars associated with(:t~Qsal banks
dominate this newly formed strata.
This zone contains the most
noticeable vegetation change.
Stream gradient variation is less
obvious, but it is evidenced by miniature waterfalls where the
tributaries intersect the creek.
Harris County has initiated a program of flood control.
Prior to creek modification, high water had a potential for being
widespread, with a tendency for slow rising and falling of water
levels.
Dramatics were subdued.
Flooding is controlled by the
size of the creek, the gradient, vegetation, meandering, soil
absorption, and efficien
~f minor drainages.
Since all of
these components have een altered, so has the flooding pattern.
The enlargement of the creek to handle a larger volume, the
steeper gradient, the lack of vegetation to retard flow, a dis­
posal bank which at times acts as an extension of the cutbank,

20

LAND MODIFICATION

development towara a luore linear flow, the efficient capa­
bilities of many heavily modified smaller drainages (Faulkey
Gully), and the greater amount of runoff as a product of the
rise in the number of impermeable surfaces (houses, streets,
parking lots, etc.) all add to a faster discharge of water,
and to a greater potential for severe flooding downstream.
The concept of relieving flood stress from populated areas
upstream by rapid channel flow has been effective, but it
produces an environmental impact downstream through erosion­
al and depositional recourse.
Minor modifications associated with urbanization are
visible in bridges, highways and roads, sand and gravel pits,
golf courses, and large land fill operations.
In summary, Cypress Creek appears to flow through two
divergent land use areas encompassed within its 100 year
floodplain.
The first could be described as upstream rural
land dominated by agriculture, open space, ~nd low density
population.
These land use areas are located west of the
intersection of U.S. Highway 290 and Cypress Creek.
A
second land use area stretches to the confluence of Spring
and Cypress Creeks.
This expanse of land could also be sub­
divided into two areas with Interstate Highway 45 as the
dividing line.
The reason for this divi8~on may
be seen in variations in population arid l.n developed land
densities, as well as the effect of flooding as seen along
the creek east of the highway.
METHODOLOGY

Introduction
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers called for archeological
investigations to be confined to the defined basin of Cypress
Creek, and to be most intensive within its 100 year flood
limits. A statistically valid sampling procedure was to be
developed in order to establish a predictive model for future
project planning in the Cypress Creek watershed.
The scope of work required that 20% of the 100 year
flood plain hJ;L surveyed.
The 100 year flood plain covers an

21

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

area of about 80 square miles.
The surrounding uplands were
to be less completely surveyed, though the percent of cover­
age was not specified.
The first step was to visually inspect the land by auto­
mobile.
A week was spent traversing the area, becoming famil­
iar with the means of access, terrain, vegetation, and land
modification, and formulating the sampling strategy which would
best fit the project area.
It was immediately obvious that an attempt to define and
sample the numerous microenvironments and ecological zones in
the project area was not necessary even if it was possible.
Severe alteration-of the land over the past 100 pruso years
makes it difficult to determine whether the contemporary life
zones were available to prehistoric people, or whether they
have been created in modern times.
Secondly, it was felt that a simple breakdown of land
stratification into flood plain and uplands would suffice.
These two strata were chosen because they represent two dis­
tinct zones, defined and separated by the 100 year flood limit.
As mapped by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the 100 year
flood limit approximates a topographic contour.
Consequently,
the flood plain and the upland areas selected for sampling
were based on topographic rather than environmental or eco­
logical parameters.
Thirdly, it was recognized that in order to find sites
in heavily vegetated areas, it would be necessary to employ
subsurface testing in addition to surface coverage.
In, areas
with a high piobability of exhibiting prehistoric remains,
small test pits were dug and the dirt screened through ~ inch
mesh.
Survey Techniques
Files at the Texas Archeological Research Lab were examined
to determine the location of previously recorded sites in the
project area.
Since no professional reconnaissance of the water­
shed had taken place, archeological reports from surrounding
areas were consulted.
All pertinent maps and aerial photographs
of the survey area were acquired.
Members of the Houston Arch­
eological Society were contacted; their knowledge of the area
was very helpful as several members had participated in arch­
eological work done along the creek.
Finding local collectors

22

METHODOLOGY

was also a primary objective as they could aid in locating
sites which might be overlooked because they lay outside
the survey s amp Ie. ­
Having established the specific areas to be sampled, the
primary goals of the field work were to locate, record, and
photograph prehistoric sites.
No set pattern for surveying
the land could be established because of the varying degrees
of visibility, vegetation density and land alteration.
Areas
which exhibited featureless topography and a lack of vegetation
were surveyed by pairs of investigators, approximately 100
meters apart, walking straight lines which criss-crossed the
sample area.
Survey was less systematic in areas which support
heavy vegetntion and have noticeable topographic features.
In many cases visibility was restricted to less than fifty
meters, and ground cover was complete.
In these areas
there was a heavy' reliance on topographic maps and aerial
photographs for locating high spots, old channel scars, and
other features which are commonly associated with prehistoric
sites.
All exposed land surfaces and rodent burrows were
checked.
The creek was always surveyed as it usually
maintained good exposed land surfaces (cutbank and channel
bottom) and was a likely setting for prehistoric occupation.
As mentioned above, site identification resanted from
surface discovery and shovel testing.
Several factors limited
subsurface probes to areas ~&§t of U.S. Highway 290. -I~§t
of the highway, no prominent land features were observed in
the areas selected for sampling on this flat prairie.
Consequently, no shovel testing was performed.
The area to
the east of the highway provided a great number of locales
suitable for test~ng, but access to them was seldom granted
by landowners.
Collection of cultural material was limited to those
sites which were viewed as threatened with destruction by
man or natural causes.
The exception to this rule was ,that,
all diagnostic artifacts were collected.
'
Sampling Strategy
A sampling design was implemented to provide the following
results; (1) ans~ifi6ient system for survey which would produce
a 20% sample of the 100 year flood plain, and at the same time,
maximize coverage
(2)
a random sample in order that simple
mathematical predictions could be made about total site popul­

ations and their densities and frequencies within the unsurveyed
80% of the flood plain, the flood plain could be compared to
the upland areas, and the areas west of U.S. Highway 290 could
be compared to the land east of the highway. (3) a systematic
survey that would permit random sample units to be chosen from
within predesignated areas and preclude large voids or gaps of
unsurveyed land, and that would ensure complete coverage of
the flood plain rather than the purely random selection that
could ~~ress some areas and be inadequate in others (4) flex-a
ibility enough to ~ccomodate anticipated problems such as land
access denial, sample units falling in the midst of heavily­
modified areas or flooding without affecting the randomness of
an exact 20% sample.
1

A stratified, systematic series compensation sampling
procedure was developed to achieve the outlined objectives for
studying the flood plain of Cypress Creek and its adjoining up­
land areas.
Judge (1975), Plog (1976), and others believe that a sys­
tematic tr&nsect design is a more efficient method of regional
survey than the quadrat survey.
At Cypress Creek, the dif­
ficulties involved with rights of entry, the numerous heavily
modified areas, and the sampling area's elongated configuration
dictated the use of quadrats over transects.
All U.S.G.S. topographic maps related to the project were
gridded using the Universal Transverse Mercator system as a
precise guide.
This grid formed 1 kilometer squares or quadrats
of equal area, which are the equivalent of the sampling units.
Any quadrat that touched the 100 year flood limit became part
of the sample universe and had an equal chance to be selected
for survey.
Each quadrat is identified by its southwest corner.
The quadrats were numbered in vertical columns from the south­
western unit to the northeastern limit of the project area.
Small tributary creeks and gullies were not included in
this numbering system.
They were blocked off and sampled sep­
arately from the main body, using the same procedure.
The
gullies formed appenda~es which in some cases would have caused
land gaps within columns of numbered quadrats, so it was felt taat
sampling a gully in its entirety was preferable to looking at
just a small section of its course (Fig.28).

Calculations were made to the nearest 1!1000th of a square
kilometer.
A small grid, equivalent in scale to one square
kilometer on the U.~.G.S. topographic maps, was drafted in 10
meter cells.
Superimposing this grid over the area to be cal­
culated, precise computations could be made.
No realistic area
calculations could be made for residential subdivisions, man­
made lakes or roads, however, because field investigations
clearly showed that what was observed on maps and aerial photo­
graphs (no matter how recent) often differed greatly from the
actual physical environment.
The selection of the quadrats to be surveyed is the most
important facet of the sampling procedure.
This selection;
process sets this method apart from the numerous other strategies
developed and tested by researchers whose parameters of study
were restricted to a random sample.
The simplicity of the procedure can be observed in the
example below.
Selection of quadrats can be readily accomp­
lished in the field, using elementary mathematics and a scratch
pad.
Beginning with sample unit #1, the area of the flood plain
within the first series of 10 quadrats is added.
This total
represents the amount of flood plain land in this series of
ten squares.
By multiplying this figure by 20% or dividing it
by five, the quota of land to be surveyed in this group of ten
sample units was determined.
The quadrats chosen for survey
were those sample units whose individual flood plain areas,
when summed, approximated 20% of the land in this series of ten
units.
Sometimes, the area of one square is sufficient to
achieve the desired amount.
In the case of a tie, a coin was
tossed to decide the squares~selected.

METHODOLOGY

In the event the combinations of flood plain areas in the
units did not add up to the exact amount of the 20% needed,
compensation in the next series of ten quadrats would be
required.
The discrepancy was added or subtracted from the
computed 20% flood plain total area in the next series so that
an overall 20% flood plain aggregate woul~he maintained.
If one of the selected sample units was inaccessible for
survey, the combination of units with which it was selected
would be rejected and the next closest combination of flood
plain area nearest to the 20% figure, would be chosen from
the same series of ten quadrats.
One exception to this rule
occurred when after several days had been expended in surveying
land chosen within a series of ten sample units, a landowner
reversed his decision and denied access to his property.
In
order that the precious amount of time spent surveying would
not be wasted by the elimination of the units and selection
of new ones, a small piece of land from the same series of
quadrats was substituted for the similar, but inaccessible,
tract.
The selection of sample units was done purely by chance.
The only aspect of the procedure which biased the random­
ness of quadrat selection was that the tracts were chosen
from a limited series of units and not from the universe as
a whole.
Since the aim of this selection process was to
achieve a stratified, systematic random sample, the imposed
control found within this system is justified.
Sample Results
The objective of sampling was to determine the density
and frequency of sites west of U.S. Highway 290 in the flood
plain and upland areas, east of the highway in the flood plain
and upland areas, and from the entire sample; and to compare
predictions of density and frequency of sites found by
surface inspection or shovel testing.(Table 1).
Sites are scarce in the upland areas.
The only upland
sites recorded are west of U.S. Highway 29~.
The overwhelming
majority of sites were located east of the highway, on the
flood plain.
Shovel testing was performed only in those eight sample
units where permission for subsurface probes had been granted.

flood plain in sampling area: 140.157 sq. km. (20% of this is 28.031 sq. km.l
flood plain surveyed (20% sample): 28.025 sq. km.
Upland surveyed: 21.604 sq. km. or 77% of flood plain total
sites found in the 20% sample: 38
sites identified by surficial inspection only:20
sites identified by shovel testing: 16

METHODOLOGY

In each of these eight units at least one site was identified
by means of shovel testing.
Probably the most interesting
calculations are those which involve comparisons between
densities and frequencies of sites found by surface inspection
and shovel testing (Table 2). Without the aid of subsurface
probes, the predictions of density and frequency would be
significantly lower.
Even though shovel testing has helped
to create a more realistic picture of the distribution of
prehistoric sites within the sample~ the actual site popul­
ations could be much greater in those areas where only
surface techniques were used.

PREHISTORIC SITE INVENTORY (20% SAMPLE)
Table 3 provides summary data on the present site in­
ventory of prehistoric sites which resulted from the 20%
sample of the 100 year flood plain and its adjacent upland
area (Fig. 9).
Pertinent information including permanent
site designations~ depth and lateral extent (where determined),
locatLon~ and description is recorded.

mation, such as data regarding associated land forms and soils,
observable past impacts, and site-specific recommendations are
also listed.
Thirty-eight prehistoric sites were recorded in'_the surveyed
sample units; with the exception of two, all were found during
the survey.
These two sites had been recorded previously by
amateurs and were on file at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratories, Balcones Research Center, Austin, Texas.
Several
other sites, known to local collectors but not recorded, were
relocated with the collector's help and all pertinent information
was recorded.
Table 3 lists the sites in sequence of discovery except for
the final two.
Gaps in the site number series are attributable
to sites found outside of the formalized sample units.
Sixteen sample units, of a possible 101, yielded identified
sites.
Unit #182 had the most prehistoric sites (seven); the
average number of sites per unit was 2.37.
All of the sites listed in Table 3 are from northwestern
Harris County.
There were no sites found in the surveyed
sample units in Waller County.
The general positions are desig­
nated by the sites' relationship to a measured stream mile and
by its proximity to the present creek channel.
The sites
found in units 1 - ·145 average approximately 1.2 kilometers
from the creek, while the sites found in units 146 - 233 are
a mean distance of about 100 meters from the present channel.
A histogram (Fig. 10) was constructed to determine whether
any significant linear clustering existed.
Stlrting at the
confluence of Spring and Cypress Creeks (mile 0) and ending at
mile 54, the frequency of sites located within intervals of
two miles was plotted.
Field work indicated that sites were
concentrated along the middle course of the stream.
Site
frequency was found to be highest between stream miles 16 and
24.
In this area, shovel testing and surface collecting were
used to identify the two most productive sample units of the
entire survey.
It is possible that this area was favored by
prehistoric populations, although test results may merely
reflect good surface visihility.
Miles 0 - 12 seem to reflect a consistent but relatively
low frequency of site occurrence.
Although prominent land forms
are less numerous, there are still many promising locations
Wh1Ch did not yield archeological material.
In this area,

SITE INVENTORY

shovel testing was primarily responsible for the identification
of prehistoric sites.
Either this area was not favored by the
prehistoric occupants, or the sites are too deeply buried or
too badly eroded to be ideritified.

There is more v2riation in

The increase in site frequency found between
mile 28 - 30 coincides with the Cypress Creek-Little Cypress
Creek juncture.
Little Cypress Creek is the largest trib­
utary of Cypress Creek.
The area around this confluence may
have been favorable for prehistoric populations.
Shovel
testing was somewhat restricted here compared to the area
farther downstream because of landowner reluctance to allow
subsurface testing.

distinct areas of prehistoric oc~upation along Cypress Creek.
The transition from the forest to the grassland prairie also
occurs here. Higher site densities correspond with the present­
day piney hardwood vege~ation type while lower frequencies are
found on the open prairie.
Only two sites were discovered
between mile 36 and mileS4; both are in upland locations.
Figure 10 is intended to be illustrative of overall site
distribution, but should not be considered a literal represen­
tation of , aboriginal settlement patterns.
It must be remembered
that the grapilc model only reflects the number of sites found
in a 20% sample.
This may account for the absence of sites
in several 6f the two-mile intervals. especially downstream
from mile 26.
Other factors which complicate the understanding
of site distribution are differential visibility and exposure,
land m'odification, weather, and variations in subsurface testing.
In the sample units surveyed, 21 different types of land­
forms were associated with the 38 recorded prehistoric sites.
Table 4 presents in tabular form the association of these land­
forms and prehistoric sites.
Each landform is described and
classified as a landform type with a letter designator in Table
3. The Gently Rolling Prairie Landform Type A was not .i.ncluded
in Table 4.
It represents the type of site/landform association
which has been defined only in the sample area west of U.S.
Highway 290. Here sites associated with the gently rolling
prairie are not viewed as being directly related either to
fluvial systems or to specific topographic features.
The three
sites found within this type give little clue to where sites
are most likely to occur on the open prairie.
The terms used for landform attributes in Table 4 are:

(1) Terraae refers to low flat terraces that are easily
flooded.
They can have natural levees.
(2) Slight rise on the terrace is a noticeable rise in
elevation above a high or low terrace.
(3) High terraae is less susceptible to flooding than a
low terrace.
(4) Creek/gully refers tm~sites that are in the immediate
vicinity of the confluence of a gully and the creek.
(5) Inside edge of Bend on Creek or Gully

40

SITE INVENTORY

(6) Outside edge of Bend on Creek or Gully
(7) Straight Course of Creek or Gully
(8) Present Creek or Gully Channe l is a modified or
unmodified channel that carries water.
It should be
noted that site 41 HR 338 is the only site recorded that
is solely supported by a gully.
(9) Cutoff ohannel is a reach of the creek that was cut­
off by county flood control activities sometime after
about 1950 (See Fi
11 for comparative modifications)(Fig. 12)
(10) Old meander soar is a reach of the creek that was
naturally cut off by stream channel alteration prior to
about 1950.(See Fig. 11 for comparative modifications)
(11) Site visibility is the de~cFiption of the density
of vegetation and the related exposure of cultural material
on- - -tbe
surface of the site area.
- - _.........._
.
a) Poor - land that rarely allows any glimpse of
exposed ground surfaces.
(b) Good - variable ground cover
(c) Excellent - consistent ground surface visibility
Table 4 is divided into a number of columns which illus­
trate the definable landform characteristics that are closely
connected to past or present fluvial systems. Almost all of
these attributes are restricted to the area east of U.S. High­
way 290, usually in close proximity to the present creek channel.
The first column lists the number of sites found associated
with specific landform types.
The individual numbers denote
the value of each correspond,:i"ng "X" _ in the succeeding columns.
An analYSis of the table shows that approximately 60%
of the sites were located on high terraces on the outside
edges of creek or gully bends, perhaps indicating prehistoric
preference for high,~dry locations overlooking the surrounding
terrain.
Sites found along the present course of a creek or
gully were slightly more prevalent than those situated along
cutoff or old meander scars.
The high correlation between particular attributes and
prehistoric sites is somewhat affected by factors of visibility.

Exposed surfaces occur on the eroding outside edge of a bend
along the present creek channel (Fig. 13). Since this is the
usual place for a high terrace remnant, and vegetation growth
is retarded by active erosional processes, cultural material
is more easily recognized.
In an area of variabl~ground
cover~ more sitesyiil be visible on the surface.
However~
visibIlity along Cypress Creek was poor except in the immediate
vicinity of the stream.
Fifty-seven percent of the sites were
found in conjunction with conditions of "poor" visibility as
compared to 14% with "excellent" visibility (Fig. 14).
Shovel testing contributed to high individual site land­

form associations.
A high terrace on the outside edge of a
bend on ei ther an old meander scar or cut6f·f channel, or near
the confluence of a creek and gully, was considered as a rational
choice for testing.
Site Depth and Area of Occupation
In only 10.5% of the sites found within the surveyed sample
units were estimates of the approximate depth of cultural material
possible.
Only 15.8% of the recorded sites allowed estimates
of the area of occupation to be made. Heavy vegetation and
limited surface exposure of cultural debris precluded estimates
in the remainder of the sample.
Few of the cutbank sites pro­
vided in situ artifacts and few sites were tested under controlled
subsurface conditions.
Only the site excavated by L.W. Patterson
(41 HR 315) has accurate depth control.
This site shows a depth
of about 60 cm.
Though a number of sites (20) were tested with
subsurface probes, shovel testing stopped once artifacts were
uncovered, so that maximum depth was not determined.
Partial
data for site dimensions were obtained in many cutbank sites.
Though surface material gives an approximation of one dimension
along the bank, little can be said about the extent of the site
away from the creek.
Soils
Eleven mapped soil units are~associated with the 38 pre­
historic sites.
Composition of the soil units variea from pure
10Gse sand and very fine sandy loam to fine sandy loam.
Future te~ting can be carried out with little difficulty.
The soil composition is such that digging and screening of the
matrix requires minimal effort. Voss soils make up 34% of the
units while Hatliff loam (13%) and Clodine loam (11%) are the
next most representative.
The remaining eight soil units each
average about 5% of the total area.
These soila have a tend­
ency to drain poorly.
This is especially true of Voss soils
which, like several others, are subject to frequent flooding.
Some of the soil units remain moderately well drained although
they too are subject to flooding to a lesser degeree.
Because
of high water retention in these soils, few of the units are
suitable for urban development.
Voss, Ratliff, and Nahatchie
soils, for example, are not preferred sites for permanent
structures.
Only through "a major increase in construction
effort, special design, or intensive maintenance u (Soil Survey

46

BITE INVENTORY

Staff 1976: 36) can these soils be built upon.
Only the
Hockley, Wockley, and Atasco s~ilsare not characeri&ed by
severe drainage probl~ms.
Their moderate limitations indi­
cate that they are not good sites for construction but "the
limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning
and design" (Soil Survey Staff 1976: 36).
Since most of the
prehistoric sites located along Cypress Creek will be in
locations similar to those found in the 20% sample, it is
encouraging to know that the soils association with these sites
are not prime candidates for construction.
Material Collected in 20% Sample Units
Recovery of artifacts in this area is usually restricted
because of the limited surface visibility.
The average number
of artifacts found at each site in Table 3 was 23.
During
the survey, a total collection was made only when a site was
thought to be in jeopardy. Diagnostic artifacts were always
collected.
The artifacts, other than diagnostics, that were
located in shovel test holes were always replaced in an
effort to disturb the site as little as possible.
The average
of 23 artifacts per site would be reduced by half if it were
not for the one site (41 HR 333) where large test pits ~~r.e
dug (Fig. 15).
This figure is further lowered if only the
collected artifacts are considered, as only 17 sites were
collected, even partially, out of a possible 38.
Chert was the dominant material collected.
Six hundred
seventy-three pieces of chert, or 78% of the total, were found
in 37 of the 38 sites identified during field sampling.
Tools
and residues of chert include projectile points, miscellaneous
tools, flakes, and chips.
Culturally modified petrified wood
was found in 15 sites and comprises 5% of the total assemblage.
One hundred fourteen ceramic sherds, the second most abundant
artifact, were recovered from 13 different sites and comprised
13% of the total material collected.
Bone, quartz, andJ:utrned clay concretions make up the
remaining group of artifacts noted in th~ sample.
The combined
_t::Q...ta:l,s represent less than 4% and were found iIl: an ave~rage
of only four sites.
The relatively low recovery of bone is
probably due to the known acid pH values and the alternate
wetting and drying of the matrices.
Summary
Culturally speaking, the archeological evidence recovered

I

47

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

in the 201 sample reflects a wide range of time in human
occupation along the creek.
Alth~ugh 58% of the sites have
no known chronological sequence, six sitesrep.resent a Late
Prehistoric occupation, one an Archaic assemblage, and nine
are multicomponent.
Three of the multicomponent sites suggest
an occupation from Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric times,
although this type of site usually has Late Prehistoric and
Archaic assemblages.
The limited occurrence of Paleoindi~n
and Early to Middle Archaic sites in the project area suggests
an increased occupation during Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric
times.
Human impact on the sites within the sample units is
occurring and ongoing.
Forty-seven percent of the sites
range from partially disturbed to completely destroyed.
Flood control measures, land development, and agriculture
are among the major transfiguring agents.
Recommendations
for future work a~e presented in the final section of this
report.
PREHISTORIC SITE INVENTORY (OUTSIDE 20% SAMPLE)
An inventory of prehistoric sites found outside the 20%
sample of the 100 year flood plain is presented in Table S
in a format identical to Table 3.
The pertinent information
reported in this table allows for comparison or contrast with
patterns established by Table 1.
Twenty sites were recorded outside of the surveyed sample
units, bringing the total number of known sites in the Cypress
Creek basin to ~8.
These sites, from the project area as a
whole, reflect more variety than those from the sampled units
alone.
As a general rule, these sites were previously recorded
or discovered with the aid of local collectors.
Consequently,
the majority are on the present creek channel where erosion
most readily exposes cultural material.
No shovel testing was
perfor-med outside the selected sample units so all these sites
are evidenced by surface material only.
All the previously recorded sites were rep6rted by members
of the Houston Archeological Society.
Since all these sites
have either been destroyed or were not relocated during the
survey, specific information on the precise location and the
artifact,..;assemblages is lacking.

48·

BITE INVENTORY

Four sites were found outside of the sample area.
Three
of these (41 HR 325, 326, 327) were associated with Mound
Creek, an upper tribritary of Cypress Creek, and outstanding
topographic features such as rolling hills or Hockley Mound.
Limited survey was pe~formed in the area surrounding these
three sites; nevertheless, survey produced a relatively high
frequency of sites for such a small area, in comparison to
the rest of the watershed.
Despite the limited information
available pertaining to upland areas, certain aspects of
prehistoric site distribution can be inferred.
Prehistoric
sites of the upland prairie are (1) located on top of the
outstanding topographic features (2) 100 - 500 meters from the
closest past or present flow of water (3) associated with
tributary, rather than major, streams (4) defined by light
lithic scatters in areas exhibiting little deposition and
(5) nonceramic.
Generally speaking, these upland prairie sites reflect
a more limited occupation than those found along Cypress
Creek based upon the lack of pottery, the intermittent water
supply, exposure to the elements and distance from the stream.
No site was found completely detached from a water source.
The fourth site, the Carl Mehrkam Cache Cobble Site,
appears to be functionally different :E rollt the 0 the r three
upland prairie sites.
Although not proximal to a stream,
it was near a depression in the prairie that was capable
of holding water.
This site produced a firiduni~ue. in the
state of Texas (Curtis Tunnell, Personal Communication)
and possiblyc in the country.
Here an apparent cache.:
about50 large cobbles, of which 25 remain, was revealed
by plowing.
All the cobbles seem to be tested by the
removal of one or more flakes to expose the rock interior.
Unlike the numerous blade or biface caches that have been
found around Texas, this is a stockpile of high quality
raw material.
The remaining sixteen sites are within the flood plain
and are similar in most respects to those sites described by
Table 2.
Primarily these sites are located on the present
channel cutbank and are not related to old meander scars or
cutoff channels.
This is a reflection of the restriction of
shovel testing to the sample survey units where these areas
of low visibility ~ere found to contain subsurface material.

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

Site Comparisons to Surrounding Areas
In the archeologically studied areas surrounding Cypress
Creek, e~idence indicates a substantial similarity in site
distribution.
In vesti ga tionscarried out along small drainage
or tributary sLstems such _~~_Buff~alolt~y~Whe~t 1953). ~nd White
Oak Bayou (Payne 1973), and Armand Bayo~ (Hole et aZ 1974),
and small rivers or the upper reaches of larger ones like the
Upper and Lower Neches River (Shafe~et a~ 1975) and the Trinity
River (McClurkan 1968) all refle~t a relatively set pattern
of prehistoric occupation. Sites are usually found on high
ground next to, or near permanent or semi-permanent water
supplies, past or present.
Stream confluences are also prime
locales for sites.
Those sites found some distance from a water supply are
usually associated with large rivers with wide flood plains
and high terraces far from the river channels.
In areas
where elevation fluctuates substantially, sites may be found
on rises set back from the creek, but close enough to permit
exploitation of water-associated resources.
Sites have seldom
been isolated on the prairie or in the woodlands with no water
reserves at hand.
The featureless topography or the lush veg­
etation in the areas not immediately adj acent to-fhe creeks
largely precludes location of any sites, if they do exist.
The pimple mounds seem to be the exception to this rule in that
they attracted prehistoric occupation (McGuff and Cox 1973: 62).
L.W. Patterson (Personal Communication) recorded sites in
association with these small, round, low mounds.
Although no
site was found on a pimple mound in the Cypress Creek watershed,
one site (41 HR 334), was located about 2 kilometers from the
creek on the open prairie in a cultivated rice field which the
landowner describes as a leveled small mound.

COLLECTED MATERIAL
A total of 767 specimens were collected from surface
and subsurface areas in the Cypress Creek basin.
This figure
does not reflect the total number of specimens observed during
the survey, as a number of sites (31) were not collected.
Projectile points, ceramics, and tools were collected and a
simple descriptive breakdown of that material is included here.

COLLECTED MATERIAL

Lithics dominated the collected material with 609 pieces
(79.3%) (Table 6). while ceramics were second with 129 sherds
(16.8%) (Table 7).
Bone and burn~d clay/concretiot;l~_~~h..e..
only other items collected.
Only 22 bone fragments (2.8%)
and 7 pieces of burned clay/concretions (.9%) were recovered.
Lithics
The categories of lithic material used in this analysis
are de'b i tage (flakes, chips, cores), flaked s tone tools (u t il­
ized/marginally retouched flakes or chips, trimmed flakes or
chips, thick bifaces/crude, thin bifaces/refined), pecked stones
(hammerstones), and miscellaneous rock.
Information on weights,
measurements, atid rock types accompany specimen descriptions
when appropriate.
DEBITAGE

FZakes
268 flakes were collected from thirteen sites.
This
total includes only unmodified flakes and makes up 44% of the
total lithic assemblage.
Flakes were categorized as (1) primary
- flakes whose outer surface is completely covered with cortex
(2) secondary - flakes whose outer surface displays any amount
of cortex other than total coverage (3) tertiary - flakes which
display the total absence of cortex.
Platform is considered
an outer surface.
The average maximum length of flakes is
3.4 cm., and the average minimum length is 1.4 cm.
Each flake type was further broken down by rock type
[chert, highly-silicified petrified wood (HSPW), and low-grade
petrified wood (LGPW~ in order to determine whether certain
rock types were preferred or merely more readily available than
others.
The HSPW usually represents fine-grained ch
p-etrified palm wood.
Its distinction from LGPW is that its
fracture pattern is similar to that of chert.
Included in the above total were 48 possible blade flakes.
Although they exhibited no evidence of utilization or retouch,
these flakes meet the criteria (flake length twice as long as
width) for having been manufactured as specific tools (blades).

53

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

Primary Flakes
Only seven primary flakes were collected during the survey.
They comprise 2.6% of the total number of recovered flakes.
Chert
is slightly more prevalent; in this type there are four chert
primary flakes, compared to three flakes of petrified wood.
No
primary flakes were observed to have been utilized or trimmed.

Secondary Flakes
This type consists of 94 secondary flakes or 35% of the
total number of flakes collected.
Only nine were made of pet­
rified wood (seven of which were highly-silicified).
The
majority of utilized/marginally retouched or trimmed flakes
fall into this type (not counted here).

(62% of total fl~ke count).
Eighty-nine percent of the tertiary
flakes were of chert, compared to 11% made of petrified wood.
Fewer tertiary than secondary flakes had been modified (not
counted here).
There were twice as many HSPW tertiary flakes
as LGPW tertiary flakes.

assemblage.
A number of chips have been modified.
They are
not included in the above total.
The maximum mean chip length
is 2.7 em., while the minimum mean is 0.8 cm.
Once again,
petrified wood is less frequent as a resource than chert.
Petrified wood makes up only 8% of the total chip count.
HSPW

Cores

Only thirty lithic spe~imens~ 5% of th~ .total lithic assem­
blage collected during the survey, were recognizabl:y cores.
Twenty-five of thes~core~ came from the Carl Mehrkam Cache
Cobble Site (41 HR 365) and are described in a separate section
of this report.
Cores are defined as pieces of stone displaying
evidence of removal of one or more flakes from their original
rock/cobble form and refle~ting no intent or purpose for flake
reduction.
Two of the five remaining cores are of low-grade
petrified wood, while the rest are of fairly good quality chert.
Because of the small number of cores in the sample, each will
be individually described.
Specimen 111
This is a small, irregularly-shaped core with the cortex
used as a striking platform, and upon which platforms were
created by subsequent flake removal.
Only six flakes seem to
have been removed from this core.
The potential for further
flake reduction was limited by its small si~e.
Length: 4.0 em.,
width: 3.2 em., thickness: 2.2 em., material: chert.
Provenience: 41 HR 335
Specimen 112
This core is a roughly rectangular rock which exhibits
only cortex platform flake reduction.
Since the material is
petrified wood, all the flake scars break irregularly along
the internal striations of the wood.
Evidence of flake removal
is minimal.
All of the flakes were taken from one facet along
the lateral edge of the stone.
The sides and one end of the
stone were used as platforms for flake removal.
The other end
shows some sighs.·of battering, as though it had been used as a
hammerstone.
Because the core is of poor quality petrified
wood, its potential for manufacture into a usable item was
limited as is shown by the small number of flakes removed.

Removal
may have been the result of utilization or it may have been
done with specific intent.
If the lataer is correct, it is not
obvious; hence, the designation "marginally retouched".
There

Of these eleven specimens, five fit into the category of

These flakes or chips exhibit obvious flake removal with
the assumed intent of forming an edge, or resharpening the
tool.
Usually these items are called scrapers and gouges.
Ten specimens' (1.6% of the total lithic assemblage) were
collected.
Six of these tools are modified chips, three are
secondary flakes, and one is a tertiary flake.
All are made

near thef~ final stage of manufacture.
Their predetermined
shape has been attained through both percussion and pressure
flake reductiony Almost all of these bifaces retain little
or no cortex.
Arrow points, arrow point fragments, dart points,
dart point fragments, knives, drills and unidentified biface
fragments form subgroups within this category.
A total of 50
thin/refined bifaces were collected during the survey.
This
constitutes 8.2% of the total lithic assemblage and 84.7% of
the total biface count.
Because only a few of these diagnostic
artifacts were recovered, each specimen is described individually.
Both arrow and dart points are subdivided into categories
according to stem variation; contracting, straight and expanding.

Arrow Point Fragments

(Fig. 17g-h,j-m)

Six arrow point fragments were collected Guring
the survey.
Two distal fragments with straight ser­
rated blades came from 41 HR 333. A proximal frag­
ment showing parts of two barBs and a broken stem,
slightly contracting, came from the same site. A
small point with no base and one damaged lateral
blade edge, one intact straight lateral blade edge
with a sharp barb, and probably of the Perdiz variety
was found at 41 HR 343.
Two points from 41 HR 375
which lack stems but have intact blades and one or
both barbs are excellently worked Catahoula points.
Both are similar to expanding stem Specimens #1 and
#2 but have more squared barbs.
The one fragment
with both barbs intact has a width of 2.4 cm. All
of the fragments were made of chert and have no cortex.

from 41 HR 338.
One large rounded rectangular chert cobhle with
convex sides shows battering from both ends.
Two sides along
the long axis show wear; possibly from use as a grinding stone.
The second specimen, a white quartzite stone, dxhibits definite
battering marks on both ends.
The third specimen, of light
blue quartzite, exhibits possible battering at one end.

It is to be e~pected th~t, in an area which possesses
or is convenient to lithic resources, a gre~ter frequency of
waste material will be present.
Flakes and chips make up the
greatest number of collected lithic specimens.
The presence
of primary flakes at some sites demonstrates that the initial
stage of manufacture did take place.
However, since the
majority of the debitage consists of small flakes and chips,
it is probable that a later stage in tool production was more
common at the sites.
The small number of cores found and the
higher percentage of tertiary flakes and small chips support
this probability.
To avoid transporting large~ heavy, un­
modified river cobbles great distances so that on-site
initial flake reduction could take place, initial decortication
probably took place at the lithic resource site, with tool
refinement occurring at the campsite.
An alternative method
for acquiring lithic material is inferred from the evidence
offered by the Carl Mehrkam Cache Cobble Site (41 HR 365).
This
a about 50 lar
tested cobbles
f
the
open prairie, suggests prehistor c man may have made major
trips for workable stone~ and then stored this raw material
for future use.
Most of the lithic material used for tool manufacture
seems to be of regional origin. No exotic rock types were
observed.
The tertiary gravel materials observed were those
found in abundance in rivers and creeks to the west and north­
west of the project area.
Some small chert cobbles and
petrified wood fragments could have come from Cypress Creek
and its neighboring Spring Creek, but such materials are
rare there, and the creeks are not a dependable source.
The
only time period in which petrified wood was heavily util­
ized as raw material was the Late Archaic.
Such point
varieties as Gary and Kent, seen in private collections and
this survey's collection, were in many instances made of
petrified wood.
Very few tools or earlier s~yle dart points
were of petrified wood.
The ratio of collected diagnostic artifacts to debitage
does not reflect reality.
As stated earlier, total collections
of artifacts at sites were not always made.
Only the diagnostic
artifacts (ceramics, projectile points) were always collected.
Also, artifacts from most cif tha exposed archeological sites
along the c reek have p robab ly been colle c ted, to varying

:83

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

degrees, by local people.
The projectile point varieties recovered from GypressCreek
clearly reflect an assemblage common to the Upper Gulf Coast.
Point types and freque~cies similar to th~ Cypress Creek assem­
blage were found at AddicksDam Reservoir, Lake Livingston and
the San Jacinto Riv.r b~sin.
gimilarities witharea~ or sites
closer to the coast were rioticed, but because of the lower
frequency of lith~c artifacts re~overed here, th~ comparability
is not always obvious.
Cultural ties with areas far to the
north and west are recognized by the fact that widespread pro­
jectile point varieties such as the Pepdiz arrow point, and San
Patpice and Mesepve dart points were recovered. At one site,
41 HR 375, a number of arrow points were found which resemble
points found at Addicks Dam Reservoir, Lake Livingston and the
San Jacinto River basin excavations.
According to Bell (1960:
pl. 8) these Catahoula arrow points have their origin in the
lower Mississippi River Valley.
Archeological investigations
have shown that this point style does exist in East Texas
though it is far less common than Pepdiz and Alba.
In the past,
Wheat (1953: pl. 35,a-h) classified this arrow point variety
as Alba. However, the CatahouZa point has distinguishing char­
acteristics such as squared barbs which are not observed in
the AZba type.
From a developmental point of view, these
point varieties may have acquired their similar attributes
by having a common derivation.
Overall, the artifact frequency within the lithic sample
is informative about cultural variations and technology.
Culturally, the diagnostic assemblage reveals a temporal range
from Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric. Artifacts from private
collections and the materials excavated from 41 HR 315 represent
a more complete temporal cross-section than does the sample
collected during the survey.
It is probable that future tests
and excavations within the Cypress Creek basin will uncover
cultural material similar in quantity and quality to the assem­
blages recovered at Addicks Dam or the San Jacinto River basin
excavations because (1) the three areas are environmentally
similar (2) ratios of artifact types collected in the course
of the survey are consistent with the artifact assemblages from
the previous excavations (3) the three areas are geographically
contiguous.
Ceramics
Ceramics represent the second most abundant type of pre­
historic cultural material collected or observed in the Cypress

COLLECTED MATERIAL

Creek basin.
However, tbe ~ignificance of this collection is
affected by the fact that only 129 ceramic pieces were recovered
from 16 out of th~ 5Brecorded sites (Table]).
The two bases, six ~im she~ds and 121 body aherds all
have sandy paste (very fine to coarse).
Only one shows signs
of a tempering agent, bone.
The vast majority of thesherds
are small body fragments with no decoration.
Only three are
decorated, either on the interior or exterior.
One specimen
has four incised parallel lines running just below the rim on
the outer surface of the sherd.
Another, a small body sherd,
has two parallel incised wavy lines on the exterior face.
The
third specimen, a rim sherd, has notchirig (pos~ibly finger­
nail marks) along the lip on the interior edge.
Thirty-one
sherds exhibit asphaltum coating to varying degrees. The
asphaltum seems to serve not only as decoration, but also
as a repair measure for cracks and general sealing of the
vessel.
Two body sherds have holes drilled in them.
It has
been suggested that the function of these hole was for hanging
or repairing cracked vessels (Suhm and Jelks 1962: 57). Many
of the sherds show signs of smoothing of the surface before
firing, but for many of these examples this process was poorly
done, leaving an uneven finished surface.
Tentatively, all of the collected ceramic material has
been divided into four ceramic types:
Goose Creek Plain~
Goose Creek Incised~ Bone Tempered and Rockport Plain. As
it is difficult to distinguish between Rockport Plain and
Black-on-Gray both types are consolidated here.
Each sherd was examined by making a fresh break on the
specimen and viewing its internal and external features with
a 25 power magnifying glass~n order to determine general size
and structure of sand particles, temper and paste and to
identify traces of asphaltum.

Goose Creek Plain and Goose Cre~k Incised were identified
according to the criteria defined by Wheat (1953: 184 - 189),
Suhm and Jelks (1962: 55, 57), and Ambler (1967: 31-3~).
Rockport Plain or Black-on-gray wer~~entified by the description
of Suhm and Jelks (1962: 1.31, 135) and Call1pbell (1961:·331-332).
The Bone Tempered sherd was distinguished by its aplastic com­
ponent.

one Bone Tempered sherd were recogni~ed.
Basic dist~nguishing
characteristics used to discr'iminate between Goose Creek and
Rockport types were: (1) color variations,·of core and external
surfaces (2) she rd thi ckness(3) 'hardness and (4 )asphal t um.
There is a possiblity that other ceramic types may be
represented in this collectio~.
Numerous types from areas
surrounding Cypress Creek have similarities to those mentioned
above.
Only through intensive analysis of a greater sample
from the area will the subtle differences be perceived.
Culturally speaking, the ceramics from Cypress Creek
generally reflect affiliations to 'cultures common to the Upper
Texas Gulf Coast. More specifically, the ceramics show close
association with areas to the south and southwest. These
areas are culturally well-known as the Galveston Bay and
Rockport Foci.
Miscellaneous Material

Bone
Twenty-two bone fragments were recovered from 41 HR 333
(15 specimens), HR 335 (1 specimen), HR 336 (5 specimens), and
HR 340 (1 specimen). All were very small, unidentifiable frag­
ments except for one long bone from 41 HR 335, which is probably
modern.
Seventy-three percent of these bones were burned.
All the bone was discarded except the one long bone.

Burned Clay/Concretions
Seven burned clay/concretions were recovered from 41
HR 333, 337, 338, 340 (2 specimens), 349 and 358.
These
specimens represent the material substituted for rock when
lithic material was not readily available for hearth construc­
':tion, (])r the result of recent fires.

in the Cypress Creek watersh~d.
According to Curtis Tunnell
(Personal Communication) it ~s also unique in Texas and, possibly,
the country.
The cache consists of approximately 50 large tested
flint cobbles.
There are a number of known caches of beads,
projectile points, large blades and thin bifaces; but never

90

CARL MEHRKAM SITE

before has a cache of stockpiled, raw material been recorded.
In 1973, Mr. Carl MehrUJIt began plowing one of his newly
acquired leased lands about 3 kilometers northeast of Hockley,
Texas.
During this first year, Mr. Mehrkam plowed his field
to a depth of about 14 inches.
One naturally depressed and
marshy portion of the field could not be cultivated.
This
type of water-holding low spot is rare here on the prairie.
The second year, plowing proceeded two inches deeper, and the
first few cobbles were exposed.
According to Mr. Mehrkam,
when he first noticed the stones they were dispersed by the
plow but still concentrated in an area approximately five by
six feet.
Realizing that rocks of this size are not common
to this area, he c6l1ected them.
He said that the stones
were found in close proximity to a very slight mound near
the depressed area.
This small mound has now been plowed
over and the field has been leveled.
Once the stonesy were cleaned and examined, Mr. Mehrkam
realized that one or more flakes had been intentionally
removed from each cobble, presumably by Indians. He returned
to the site with assistants and a backhoe, hoping to uncover
more artifacts and, perhaps, an Indian burial.
A trench four
feet deep was dug and all the upturned soil was raked.
To
their disappointment, all that was found were more cobbles.
No projectile points, flakes or chips were noticed. Mr.
Mehrkam states that if anything other than cobbles were there
they would have been observed.
He recalls that all of the
cobbles came from a depth of no more than about two feet.
No
discoloration of the soil was apparent and no clustering of
the rocks was noted, although any grouping would have been
disturbed by the plow and backhoe. Approximately SO cobbles
were originally recovered from the plowing and digging.(Fig.2~)
~oday the cache is represented by 25 chert cobbles.
Approx­
imately the same number was lost to individuals who, on the
day of intensive digging, took many stones out of Mr. Mehrkam's
truck for use in their gardens.
The lost cobbles are described
as exactly like the ones that remain, in that all were very
large flint river cobbles with at least one flake removed.
The remaining part of the collection has been permanently
loaned to the University of Texas at Austin for study.

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

The results of a preliminary examination of the 25 cobbles
are tabulated in Table 8.
Certain similarities among the stones
are readily perceived. All of the cobbles are typically stream­
rolled rocks.
Each has been shaped to a rounded to well-rounded
form through natural fluvial processes.
The stones vary in
shape from oblong to flat to odd, irregular forms.
Both the
natural exterior and interior materials are quite similar in
color.
The cortex colors are generally light shades of brown
and gray to white, while the interio!-"B are almost always a
dark shade of brawn. All the specimens are of good to excel­
lant quality chert.
Varying degrees of impurities affect the
color only.
The cobbles are much larger and heavier than characteristic
locally-known lithic resources. Together the cobbles weight
24,910.8 grams or 55.3 po~nds..
They range in weight from 506.6
grams or 1.1 pound to 1,994.3 grams or 4.4 pounds.
The longest
cobble measures 15.9 centimeters; the average length is 13.2
centimeters.
The flake reduction pattern observed on the cobbles is
intriguing.
Twelve cobbles or 48% of the specimens have only
one, usually small, flake removed from an end of the cobble
as though to test the inner quality of the rock with as little
waste as possible.
The rest of the stones have between two
and seven flakes removed, with an overall average of 2.4 flakes.
Multiple flake removal suggests that the rock quality was
thoroughly checked.
Perhaps some flaw in the material was
detected after the first flake removal and the additional flake 1
scars evidence an attempt to determine the extent of the impurity.
Many of the cobbles have mUltiple flake removals from opposite
ends of the stone.
Despite the three to one ratio of cortex
platform flakes to prepared platform flakes, there is a chance
some of the extracted material was used for tool manufacture.
Almost all of the removed flakes were long, wide and thick
enough to be made into, or used as, tools.
The majority of
the flakes were primary, the remainder secondary. The substan­
tial amount of cortex presant on one facet of all these flakes
would have made them difficult to thin or use.
No tertiary
or interior flakes were apparent from the flake scars on the
cobbles.
There is a readily discernible sequence of decortication

92

SITE

on several cobbles.
Cobble "D" is a good example.
Four flakes
were removed in a row, with some overlap.
Instead of the one
flake that would have been sufficient to test the cobble, three
more were removed in rapid succession.
Another type of probably unintentional flake removal is
quite common on the specimens.
An accidental or uncontrolled
blow to the cobble detached extra flakes or the cobble was
halved by poorly placed blows to the rock's outer surface.
Chatter marks are present on all of the specimens. These
small knicks can be caused by attempts to prepare a platform,
by rocks hitting against one another during collection and
transportation inanci~nt or modern~.times,
by being hit by
a plow, or, possibly, by the cobble's use as a battering
implement.
Definitive statements about the Carl Mehrkam Cache Cobble
Site must await further analysis.
The origins of the cobbles,
the method of transport, and the reasons for the abandonment
are open questions. The absence of accompanying diagnostic
artifacts impedes dating of the cache.
The combined weight
of the cobbles (approximately 100 pounds) would imply either
group action or multiple deposition by one individual.
The
cache was probably stored or hidden with onjy the small
depression as a marker.
There is no evidence of camping at
the site as only the cobbles were observed.
The site is not
altogether inexplicable since it would be easily accessible
for trading along Cypress or Spring Creeks or when a lithic
supply was needed for personal use.
It is possible this cache
contained stockpiled material to supply an area which lacked
convenient natural lithic resources.
The closest possible source or sources for stone of this
size and quality is along the major rivers which are capable
of transporting large amounts of tertiary gravels.
The
Brazos aud the Colorado are the on~y rivers near the Cypress
Creek watershed that have or had the potential for moving
such gravels.
Cobbles equivalent in size to those in the
cache have been reported on the Brazos north of Bryan, Texas
(Epps 1973: 32) and on the Colorado River near Columbus, Texas.
This size rock occurs in gravel bars in a river channel or on
old exposed Pleistocene terraces.

from the cache seem to suggest the sec6nd locality.
A matrix
of conglomerated cemented sand and quartzite has adhered to
the outer natural surface of these cobbles.
Becafise this matrix
would be washed off cobbles found in the active channel of a
river, these three specimens, and possibly the rest, probably
came from an exposed strata and not from a loose gravel deposit
such as a river bar.
If the prehistoric inhabitants did collect
these cobbles on the Colorado River, they would have had to
cross the Brazos to do so. Petrographic analysis and comparative
studies with selected materials from both locations could settle
the question of the origin of the cobbles.

41 HR 315: AN EXCAVATED SITE
During the summer of 1977, cultural matetial was exposed
in the Ravensway subdivision after the initial phase of land
clearing for construction had taken place. L.W. Patterson.
a Houston 'Archeolo~ic,,!l Society m~~l!lbe!.~ __tIlveJ!!.!~~ted this site
after a 10caT resi ent oTt:11esubdivision made notE!· of· the. pt'e­
sence of artifacts on the surface. Patterson is a very active
amateur in the field of archeology and has recorded and excavated
numerous sites in Harris County.
He has worked in areas near
Cypress Creek, such as in the Addicks Dam Reservoir and along
Buffalo Bayou.
Patterson extensively surveyed the Ravensway subdivision around
the spot where local residents had collected archeological
material.
As a result, he recorded five separate locales within
a 300 by 1100 foot area where artifacts were present.
After testing of the five locales was completed, one
(Location "C") seemed worthy of intensive excavation (Fig. 5).
Beg:1nning at the end of May and ending late in the year, 42
test pits were excavated. By utilizing weekends and holidays
as work days, approximately 10% of this location was sampled.
Excavation was carried out in arbitrary 10 centimeter levels
as there was no easily discernible stratigraphy.
The work re­
vealed that an upper lens (10 em.) of clay and sand, a result
of construction activities, capped the site.
Below this were
about 50 centimeters of soil containing cultural material.
Sterile clay was reached at that point.

41 HR315

In this relatively small area (50 by 90 feet) are repre­
sented approximately 7,000 years of prehistoric occupation.
Cultural stratification was found to be relatively intact with
Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric times adequately represented
by a number of diagnostic artifacts.
Paleoindian or Early
Archaic points, such as Ptainview, Angostura, and San Patrice,
were found in the lowest level with some mixing with later Archaic
material.
Although this level reveals much greater time depth
than the upper zones, soil deposition here for this amount
of time is minimal. Patterson states that "this possibly
indicates a slow rate of soil deposition and/or a severe
erosional epoch".
The upper five levels represent the relatively short
period of time between the Late Archaic and the Late Pre­
historic.
Good ser~ation was possible here, permitting finite
divisions of chronology and typology of artifacts.
Lithics make up the majority of the recovered material.
Though faunal material was present throughout the levels, poor
preservation was the general rule.
The one feature discovered
appeared to be a hearth made of burned clay lumps.
In conclusion, this test/excavation is very important:
to the understanding of what may be expected from some of the
sites found along Cypress Creek.
Since this is the only exca­
vation which has been conducted in the watershed, its information
about subsurface material such as the artifact assemblages and
typology, faunal material and preservation, stratification and
chronological sequences, site depth and area of occupation
make it a unique model.
The physical location of the site
is also somewhat unusual.
Although.the'landfonm upon which the
site is situated is common, it is not a prominent topographic
feature.
In this .heavily wooded area, with complete leaf and
grass cover, on flat ground at the edge of a gently downward­
sloping terrace, this site might never have been discovered
without the help of human modification of the land surface.
As this type of land situation is common, there may be other
multicomponent sites along the creek in similar locales.
The information in th ~s section was taken from L.W.
Patterson's "Preliminary: Report .on Site 41 HR 315, Harris
County, Texas"! which was pub!ls11,ed it:l,~the Jlnuston AX'obae.!.2l.oJ:l.i.t::..a.Z

Further detailed des­
cription of the analysis of the artifacts will be published in
the newsletter at a later date.
DOCUMENTED PRIVATE COLLECTIONS AND ISOLATED FINDS

PrimsrLly, the survey's efforts were committed to obtaining
a 20% sample of the 100 year flood plain.
To augment these dat~
information relevent~t6 the vast area outside the 100 year flood
plain was obtained through the assistance of private collectors.
This complementary data is presented as descriptions of collections
made by local landowners as well as Isolated Finds (IF) by the
surveyor local persons.
It is highly probably that a number
of Isolated Finds could be related to sites, but because no
other cultural material was observed, site designations could
not be given.

Colleation #1
This col£ection was made by Glen and Sadie Curry who live
north of House Bahl Road on the Longenbaugh ranch.
Their collection
came from.two separate locations, both on the ranch.
Locale tIl is
about 2.5 kilometers northwest of 41 HR 334, on the bank of a
cutoff meander which is now part of a large reservoir tank just
north of the creek.
This locale yielded one Late Archaic dart
point of yellowish-brown chert. Locale #2 is also numbered
41 HR 334.
The full range of time from Paleoindian to Late
Prehistoric is seen in this collection.
The material was
gathered from a terraced rice field which has been under
cultivation for a number of years.
According to the landowners,
there was a mound, now leveled, where the artifActs are found
(Fig. 21).

This collection represents an artifact assemblage typical
of this area.
A few Paleoindian/Early Archaic points (one or
two possible Plainview types), numerous Mid to Late Archaic
points with emphasis on the Late Archaic (Bulverde~ WelZs~
Xent~ Gary varieties), and a very few Late Prehistoric arrow
points (one possibly an Alba) make up the diagnostic lithic
types.
Other fragmented dart points, a drill, several thin
biface/knife forms and one core complete the collection.

---

DOCUMENTED COLLECTIONS

There is considerable variation~in the lithic material
represented.
Of the 32 lithic artifacts four are of petrified
wood and 28 of cherts of varying quality.
The petrified wood
pieces are of the Kent Late Archaic dart point style.
The
few ceramics in the collection are small sandy paste sherds.
Photographs and drawings were made of all the lithic
artifacts.
This collection's importance is gained from
its location, one of the few open prairie sites known in
the area.

Collection #2
Four chert artifacts, including a large Morhiss variety
dart point (approximately 9 centimeters long), a fragmentary
expanding stem/concave base dart point, and two secondary
flakes, were found by Mr. Roy Kellogg on a farm now leased
by Mr. James Lowery.
Mrs. Kellogg could not identify a
specific location other than that the artifacts were found
on the open prairie in association with small sandy mounds
which have now been leveled for farming.
The area from
which these artifacts reportedly came is directly
south of Collection #1's locale and about four kilometers
from the creek.
This area was surveyed but no other material
was observed.
Drawings, photographs, and notes were taken on the
collection.

Collection #3
This collection is made up of three projectile points
which were collected by Mr. Calvin House at two separate
but nearby locations.
On the southeast bank of a small
pond behind the Calvin House farm headquarters were found
one dart point with a slightly convex blade edge, weak
shoulders and a small and slightly contracting stem with
rounded base, and one Nolan dart point with a straight
edged triangular blade, expanding stem and straight ba~e.
The second location, about half a kilometer north of the
first, yielded a single dart point with a slightly convex
blade edge, expanding stem and convex base fou~d on a
levee along a drainage ditch.
Photographs, notes and drawings were made of the artifacts.

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

Collection #4
This extensive collection was accumulated by the Raymond
Anderson family from three different locations along Cypress
Creek.
The first locale is site 41 HR 342. Mr. Anderson said
they consistently found very crude dart points eroding from
the cutbank here but no pottery was found.
Fifteen dart
points were tentatively identified as coming from this site.
Most of these points were fairly small with a mean length of
five centimeters.
The most common materials are low-~rade c
chert and petrified wood.
Point types represente
'
Wells" Kent" Palmillas and Lerma/Refugio, a Late Archaic
as semb 1age.
The remainder of the collection is a mixture of material
from the second and third locations, sites 41 HR 343 and 41
HR 368.
Included are fourteen arrow points, 57 whole and
fragmentary dart points, 1anceolate knives, scrapers and
drills, numerous biface fragments, and large quantities of
flint debitage and pottery sherds with a few decorated sherds.
The full range from Pa1eoindian to Late Prehistoric is
represented by this part of the collection.
Several San
Patrice Pa1eoindian points were identified. The bulk of
the diagnostic artifacts are Bulverde, Gary" Wells, Ensor
and Fairland from the Archaic period.
The Late Prehistoric
was also well represented by Scallorn" Alba" and Perdiz
arrow points.
The pottery was almost all Goose Creek or
Rockport Plain sandy paste sherds. Some bone tempering was
evident.
The only decoration on any of the sherds was some
rim notching and punctations. Mr. Anderson recalled that
several large sherds with heavy asphaltum on them had come
from 41 HR 368.
As is typical of collections and surface material along
the creek, the Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric are best
represented oy these artifacts~ Photographs and notes were taken.

Collection #5
The largest collection of prehistoric artifacts from the
Cypress Creek area was accumulated a number of years ago by
G.A. Hohensee.
This collection was donated to the Museum of

report.

The part of the collection documented was a diverse
assemblage of lithic and ceramic artifacts.
Nine intact
arrow points, primarily Perdiz, 159 dart points with at
least bases intact, two drills, two ground stones of sand­
stone, and five sandy paste sherds were counted. Several
hundred other pieces such as retouched flakes, bifaces, cores,
dart point fragments, arrow point fragments, and lithic
debitage are part of this collection.
Four of the nine
arrow points and 90 of the 159 dart points were made of
petrified wood.
Heavy use of petrified wood seems to be
characteristic of the later Archaic diagnostic artifacts,
while the Paleoindian and earlier Archaic material indicates
a preference for higher quality cherts.
Fifty to sixty percent
of the tools and debitage reflect the heavy utilization of
petrified wood.
No provenience is available for
this collection.

Colleation #6
This collection was acquired by Mr. Herbert "Buster"
Theiss from two specific locations now designated as 41
HR 372 and 373.
Mr Theiss was not certain which site
individual artifacts came from so separation of the material
by provenience was not possible.
Five arrow points, 48 dart
~nts with cQ~te bases, one large drill, several knives,
numerous biface and dart:pcint fragments, twelve sandy paste
sherds, and a smooth oval stone with a drilled hole and
incised parallel lines on one end are in this collection.
Once again, the majority of the dart points are of Late
Archaic varieties.
Most of them are poorly worked petrified
wood or low-grade chert.
One point was of white quartzite.

Projectile point types in this collection which are not charac~
teristic of the region are one fragmentary Montell point and
one Lerma-like point.

Isolated Find #1

This possible Paleoindian point (Meserve or reworked Plain­
view) was found on a levee of a drain~ge ditch in a terraced
field, presently under cover of grass and brush.
The find was
made about 2.4 kilometers southeast of Cypress Creek. No other
cultural material was observed in ~he immediate area.

Isolated Find #8
An isolated dart point uf~petrified wood was found unassoc­
iated with any other cultural material, at the base of the creek
cutbank between sites 41 HR 335 and 336.

Isolated Find #3
A long chip with heavy retouch along both lateral edges
was found on an eroding cutbank of the creek, slightly down­
stream from 41 HR 358.

Isolated Find #4
This Perdiz arrow point was found by Mr. Jimmy Warren on
Hockley Mound (41 HR 327). Other arrow points found here have
been lost.
Photographs and notes were taken.

alated Find #6
Mr. Jimmy Warren also found this projectile point on the
southwestern shore of Warren Lake.
This artifact is a large
dart point with slightly constricting stem, prominent shoulders,
and long, straight-edged blade. Mr. Warren states he noted
quantities of flint below the lake in the creek, but did not
collect any.
Photographs and notes were taken.

Isolated Find #8
A large Bulvepde-like dart point was found by Mr. James
Lowery approximately four kilometers south of Cypress Creek
on a rice field levee.
Before the field was leveled, there
were reportedly numerous small sandy knolls dotting the
prairie.
Sketches and notes were taken.

Isolated Find #9
A large dart point with slightly convex edges on a
triangular blade, and with prominent shoulders, was found
by Mr. Edwin Kleb in a plowed field approximately .2 kilo­
meter northeast of LitITecypressCree~-~-

Isolated Find #10
About 20 pounds of petrified wood were collected by
Mr. Edwin Kleb in one hour as he walked along the stream
bed of Spring Creek. Most of the material is fragmentary,
but some of it is of knapping size and quality.
This
collection was made west of the crossing of Kickapoo Road
and Spring Creek in the northwest part of the watershed.

Acknowledgments
There are many agencies and individuals who deserve thanks.
The Texas Highway Department gave the survey numerous updated
aerial photographs that were invaluable. <The Soil Conservation
Service was very helpful with information and publications.
The Harris County Flood Control Project made available numerous
maps showing modifications along the creek. Many thanks go
to Mrs. Judy Overby~ of Judge Jon Lindsay's office.
She was
very informative about problems that might be encountered at
specific points and about property owners. Additional thanks
go to L.W. Patterson and Bill McClure, for getting us
archeologically settled into the area and to members of the
Houston Archaeological Society, especially Dick Gregg, Charles
Magan, Frank Brezig, and Tom Nukkols, who helped survey some
of the land. We also appreciated the help of personal friends
Randy and Joseph Burton, a father-son team wh~ participated
in the fieldwork.
In addition, Ann WeQger~and~~ynn Carroll
earned our deepest gratitude for tracking down the elusive
Hohensee collection in the Houston Museum of Natural Science.
The John Mitchell family gave us the use of one of their
farm houses for the duration of the project. We are greatly
indebted to them for their overwhelming generosity.
Special thanks go to Kit Taylor who diligently aided
with the analysis of the artifacts, to Maxine and Neal Morris
whose precise and thorough field work was invaluable, to Elton
Prewitt, Robert J. Mallouf, and Curtis Tunnell for support and
advice, to Margaret Kluge and Solveig Turpin for production
of the final manuscript, and to Dr. Dave Dibble for giving
me this professional opportunity. Last, but by no means least,
my appreciation goes to my sister, Jana Hale and my wife, Ginger.

A PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF THE
HISTORICAL RESOURCES OF CYPRESS CREEK
Introduction
Few counties in Texas have changed and grown as much
as Harris County in historic times.
From forest land in­
habited only by Orcoquiza Indians, and later Spanish
explorers and missionaries, the northwestern portion of the
county became a prime settlement area for Austin colonists
and German immigrants.
Families streamed into the county
along Cypress and Spring creeks and, taking up various
amounts of land, established permanent farms and small
ranching communities, venturing only occasionally into the
town southeast of them which would eventually have such an
impact on their futures.
By 1978, almost all traces of what was once a rural
way of life had disappeared from the Cypress Creek area.
In fact, it would be difficult to assess, other than statis­
tically, the extent to which even the physical appearance
of northwestern Harris County has changed within the last
twenty years.
Spurred on by a developing petrochemical
field and aero-space industry, the county has experienced
unprecedented booms, at least one of which has centered
specifically on the northwestern area with the construction
of the Houston Intercontinental Airport in the 1960's.
Developers flocked to the land around Farm to Market Road
1960 and Cypress Creek, and as houses sprang up and new
roads criss-crossed the area, entire subdivisions appeared
where forest had been only months before.
By 1970, the
population surrounding Cypress Creek was 75,000.
By 1977
it was 200,000, a phenomenal jump which caused the Wall
Street Journal to announce that the FM 1960 area was the
fastest growing residential community in the United States.
Such growth has been accompanied by problems both
predictable and unforeseen.
To new homeowners, floods
along Cypress Creek seem to occur with frightening regular­
ity,a condition aggravated by increased run-off from
developments and construction of homes within the floodplain
itself.
Just as serious has been the loss of various kinds

117

INTRODUCTION

of cultural materials and information. Many areas are rich
in prehistoric sites.
In addition, much of the heritage of
Cypress Creek and northwestern Harris County is in danger of
being lost as entire families and communities of older
residents, whose memories of Cypress Creek stretch back to
their ancestors' arrival there, have been forced by infla­
tionary taxes to move to other parts of the county and state.
In effect, because of the growth patterns of the last fif­
teen years, the historic resources, both personal memories
and physical remains, are seriously endangered.
A survey for historic sites along Cypress Creek, then,
has been strongly affected by recent events.
Because the
land is private property and subject to uncontrolled growth,
large blocks that were woodlands last year have changed
their appearance and function today.
Sites have disappeared
with startling rapidity in an area that has, unfortunately,
never before been surveyed for historic sites or buildings.
Today, only hints remain in the structures still standing
of what Cypress Creek might have looked like when the first
settlers arrived.
Even less remains, except in documentary
sources or archeological sites, to remind us of what the
land might have been when it was inhabited by its first
historic residents, the Orcoquiza Indians.
Historical Overview
CYPRESS CREEK, 171Q-1820
Hundreds of years before the new immigration of twen~
tieth-century suburbanites to northwestern Harris County,
the land was sparsely occupied by a little-known group of
Indians called the Orcoquiza.
Variously called Orcoquiza,
Orcoquisa, Arkokisa, and Akokisa, they were members of the
Attacapan family (together with the Bidai, Deadose, and
Attacapa) which in turn was part of the larger Tunican
linguistic stock (Swanton 1928: 678).
Although allied
linguistically with other Southeastern cultures, they were
not actually part of the Southeastern cultural center,
being loosely organized and practicing cannibalism in what
Swanton has called "something more than merely ritual form"
(1928: 712).

118

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

Early descriptions of the Orcoquiza are scarce and incomplete,
and not all of them are trustworthy.
Joe Ben Wheat, for
example, is chary of using Cabeza de Vaca's narrative for
information concerning native tribes because "of its vague­
ness from an ethnological point of view.
Some of his state­
ments are at variance with later information.
." (Wheat
1953: 158).
Surely the disputes surrounding the location
of his shipwreck and subsequent travels suggest that hi~~
data should be used with great care.
In the years following Cabeza de Vaca's 1528 shipwreck,
several other explorers such as De Soto, Moscoso, La Salle,
and Alonso de Leon, Jr., came near the Akokisa area.
How­
ever, the first explo£er to leave any ethnographic record
did not enter the scene until almost 200 years after Cabeza
de Vaca.
A French officer, Simars de Bellisle was only
twenty-four years old when he landed in Galveston Bay with
four companions in 1719.
Bellisle had left France intending to land in Louisi­
ana.
However, the ship on which he sailed passed its in­
tended mark in the Gulf of Mexico, and eventually ran
aground near Galveston Bay.
On board, events tooksa turn
for the worse, and Bellisle and four companions received
permission to land and attempt to guide the ship back to its
original destination by lighting fires on shore.
But, they
were deserted during the night.
Bellisle and his companions
began to search for a navigable river or passable prairie
which took them to the Sabine and San Jacinto rivers, and
eventually resulted in the death of all but Bellisle (Folmer
1940: 204-214).
Two weeks into the search, Bellisle sighted Indians on
an isla~n acr~ss the bay, and he rowed across to join them.
Although they stripped him of all clothing,. they also fed
him fish and birds' eggs they had collected.
The following
day, he was taken to the mainland where the rest of the
tribe waited.
"Greeted" by yelling, he was soon incorporated
into the tribe as a servant.
He went with the Indians every­
where in search of food "because they possess no cabins or
fields."
Men killed deer and buffalo, while women searched
for wild potatoes (Folmer 1940: 215-216).

119

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

As winter approached, Bellisle accompanied the Indians
as they joined another band at the end of the bay.
Attempts
to send a message to European settlements apparently failed
as the Indians took the letter, but only passed it among
themselves (Folmer 1940: 217-218).
Although the locations of Bellisle's adventures have
never been positively identified, much of the territory
described is similar to that along the Trinity and San
Jacinto rivers.
At one point, while on a buffalo hunt
several days' ride from the coast, he mentioned "a prairie
which seemed endless in every direction and where numerous
buffaloes were grazing."
He remembered later that the land
where they had hunted was beautiful, extensive prairie land
where the earth was "almost black.
Grass grows there to a
prodigal height, and in abundance, which is a sure sign that
the earth is good" (Folmer 1940: 218-219), a description
similar to that of Gideon Lincecum in 1835 when he commented
on "the vast, the boundless sea of grass[.JII He wrote:
"Leaving the head of these creeks [Cypress and Spring] you
enter the main prairie which is to the eye of the creeping
traveller bounded by nothing but the heaven, and the soil
is as good as the hear[t] could desire" (Bradford and Camp­
bell 1949: 187).
Eventually, Bellisle was rescued from the Akokisa by a
group of Hasinai Indians who saw his letter while visiting
the Akokisa, and took him to safety in New Orleans.
His
story of captivity, flamboyant and unbelievable as it might
seem, was confirmed when he returned to Galveston Bay with
Benard de la Harpe in 1721, and the two men went ashore
where Bellisle was recognized by the local Indians (Folmer
1940: 226-228).
The tribe's identity as Akokisa, or Atakapa,
was borne out by a vocabulary which was recorded by another
of the travellers, Jean Berenger (Gatchet and Swanton 1932:
2) •

Although it would be impossible to assert that Bellisle
ever travelled near Cypress Creek, it is clear that he lived
with and recorded the mores of a group of Indians who were
culturally related to the Orcoquiza.
By extrapolation, it
is possible to characterize the culture and habits which
probably were typical of many of the Akokisa coastal groups
in the early historic period.

120

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

According to Bellisle's account, the economic cycle of
the various bands was largely determined by a search for
natural food.
Winter found them in permanent or semi­
permanent camps, while summer saw them wandering in search
of food (Wheat 1953: 161).
Their main activities included
hunting,)fishing'oand gathering, while they practiced only
minimal agriculture.
Birds' eggs and fish made up a large
part of their diet, as did "wild potatoes lf and various
meats, including deer, bear, and bison.
Significantly,
Bellisle mentioned that by 1719, bison hunting was dl>lle
from horseback (Folmer 1940: 218).
From Bellisle's account, it is not clear what form
shelter took.
Furthermore, although he mentioned the use of
pottery and inferred that it had value, he did not describe
its appearance or source.
However, Swanton has stated that
the Akokisa received most of their pottery in trade from the
Karankawa, Avoyel, and possibly the Caddo (Wheat 1953: 161).
Bellisle's foray among the coastal Indians was only a
forerunner of more intense French activity which was to
occur in the years to come.
The founding of New Orleans in
1718 marked the advent of strong trade initiatives as the
French, pushing west and south along the Gulf coast, passed
the lower Sabine River and encountered the Orcoquiza.
Joseph Blancpain, for example, was at work trading among the
Orcoquiza by 1729, only ten years after Bellisle's first,
unhappy encounter with them.
The attraction for the French
lay with the bearskins, buckskins, and buffalo hides which
the Orcoquiza had; by the 1730's, trade between the two
cultures was strong.
The French initiative elicited a strong response from
the Spanish who, although they had hardly explored the area
at all, found themselves inspired to defend it and win the
allegiance of its Indian inhabitants.
In 1745-1746, the
first such expedition was headed by Joaqu!n Orobio Bazterra
who was sent from La Bah!a to the Trinity, and by March 15,
1746, after possibly crossing Cypress Creek, arrived at a
site he called Puesto de San Rafael. According to Bolton
and all subsequent students of the issue, Orobio Bazterra's
camp was probably located on Spring Creek, just north of

121

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

Cypress Creek.
He camped near two Orcoquiza villages and
confirmed reports that the French were moving freely among
them (Bolton 1962: 64-65, 329-330).
Bolton further stated that the Orcoquiza, at the time
of Orobio Bazterra's visit, were living in four or five
villages near the San Jacinto and lower Trinity - most of
them located along Spring Creek. (Bolton 1962: 65).
These
villages included that of Chief Canos, which Bolton placed
near the junction of the San Jacinto and Spring Creek, with­
in a gun shot of the Creek; the village of E1 Gordo, located
about 20 miles up Spring Creek; and that of Chief Mateo,
still further northwest (Bolton 1962: 332).
Neighbors were
the Attacapa near modern-day Beaumont, Bidai and Deadose on
the north, Coco on the west, and Karankawa and Cujane on
the west and southwest (Bolton 1962: 334).
Earliest Spanish accounts were not clear where tribal
organization or population were concerned, but apparently
there was some debate concerning the leader of the Orcoquiza.
Their numbers were small, and Orobio Bazterra, after his
second visit, declared that the Orcoquiza had five villages
of about 300 families or 1,200 individuals (Bolton 1962:
335), a number that could be declared maximum as they suc­
cumbed to disease in the years to come. Unlike the Akokisa
of Be11isle's account, the Orcoquiza practiced some limited
agriculture, raising maize.
However, the bulk of their diet
was similar to what Bellisle had described:
fish, wild
fruits, and game, including deer and bear.
The arrest of Joseph Blancpain in October 1754 and his
subsequent imprisonment and interrogation in Mexico yielded
information which eventually inspired the Spanish to estab­
lish a mission, presidio, and civil settlement at a site
called E1 Orcoquisac on the lower Trinity River.
This
settlement normally would have little bearing on the history
of Spanish and Indian activity in the present-day Cypress
Creek area were it not for the fact that the original site,
garrisoned in 1755, was deemed unhealthy and undesirable by
so many of its inhabitants.
In fact, the complaints became
so strong that during 1756 and 1757 Governor Barrios ordered
further exploration for a more suitable location and com­
missioned Lieutenant Del Rio and Don Bernardo de Miranda
each to make preliminary surveys.
On August 26, 1756, they

122

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

made their reports and agreed that the most desirable area
was in the center of the Orcoquiza tribe on the arroyo of
San£a Rosa del Alc&zap (Spring Creek) (Bolton 1962: 7~).
Subsequently, Barrios had SpringgCreek surveyed by
two men named Morales (also spelled Morelos) and Hernandez.
The party made an initial scout and then returned to San
August!n for reinforcements.
By September 13, 1756, they
were back in the vicinity of the San Jacinto, examining
some springs 6 leagues west of the river; the following day
they encamped near Antonio (Morales'?) rancho.
They reported
that the land on a large stream nearby, and on all the
stream's branches, was well-watered and rich and that, while
there was no stone, there was abundant timber (Brown 1909:
41-42).
Although the recommendations of all involved were
favorable, and despite the fact that Barrios had originated
the move to Spring Creek, nothing was done about moving El
Orcoquisac there.
Barrios' personal examination of the
territory, as well as that by Governor Don~Aniel~Martos y
Navarrete in 1759, resulted in objections to the Santa Rosa!
Spring Creek site, and the issue was dropped.
Subsequent
reports on the Orcoquiza Indians of Cypress and Spring
creeks consisted almost entirely of infrequent records of
their population and location.
On February 20, 1778,
Athanase de Mezieres wrote to the viceroy that the Atacapa
and Orcoquiza were found
at the mouths of the Nechas and Trinity Rivers.
They are without fixed residence, do not cul­
tivate the soil, are the least numerous, and the
least to be esteemed for any arduous undertaking,
because, since they live under the protection of
the other tribes, who free them from every attack,
they never take up arms except to hunt.
This
class is contiguous to and allied with other
wandering Indians, namely the Caranames • • •
[Bolton believed Carancaguases (Karankawas) was
meant here.]
(Bblton 1!14:1IZ2~17J)
Morfi wrote in 1779 that the Akokisa had untied with
neighboring tribes in establishing themselves on the coast
between the Colorado and Brazos rivers (Wheat 1953: 161), a

123

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

location that had changed little by 1820 and the opening of
the Anglo period, when Juan Antonio Padilla included the
Oroquiza among the fifteen friendly tribes.
They numbered
about 300 and were located at the mouth of the Trinity River.
They resemble the Yugan!s; although they do not
streak their faces.
Their occupations are
limited to hunting and farming.
They go down to
the seashore from whence they secure fragments
of ships and other things cast up by the sea.
They know how to manage a canoe, and they are
excellent swimmers.
They carry their furs to
Carcashu and Oppelousas to exchange with
foreigners who live in those settlements, which
are under the jurisdiction of the United States,
and which are not far from the coast.
They per­
formed many services for the troops who were
stationed at Atascocito, also called Orcoquisac,
until the year 1812, when the frontier was
abandoned (Hatcher 1919: 51).
CYPRESS CREEK, 1820-1846
If coastal Texas and northwestern Harris County held few
natural attractions for the Spanish, it was enormously
desirable to Anglo-American colonists from the Deep South in
the 1820's and 1830's and to the German pioneers who followed
them until the Civil War period.
Accustomed to rolling
prairies and wet bottom lands, Southerners flocked to parti­
cipate in the land colonization efforts led by Moses and
Stephen F. Austin.
The most attractive land was naturally
taken first, and by the mid-1820's, dozens of families had
received grants within a colony bounded by the San Jacinto
River on the east, the Old San Antonio Road on the north,
the Lavaca River on the west, and a line about 25 miles in
from the coast on the south (American Association of Univer­
sity Women 1977: 12-15).
Some of the first areas to be settled in Harris County
included Buffalo and Cedar bayous and the San Jacinto River.
Pioneers such as Stephen F. Austin's relative, John Austin,
John Richardson Harris, William Vince, and Nathaniel Lynch
received first colony land grants in 1824.
Others of the

124

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

Old Three Hundred apparently preferred the northern portion
of Harris County, where claimants included Frederick Rankin,
David Harris, and William Whitlock along the San Jacinto
River (Looscan 1914: 198).
Like the Orcoquiza Indians of fifty years before,
many participants in Austin's second colony seemed to prefer
Spring Creek.
By and large, most of these colonists were
granted land after 1830.
They included Joseph Miller, Joseph
House, John H. Edwards, Abraham Roberts, Samuel McCarley,
and Jesse Denson.
Four years later, a member of Austin's fifth colony
received a league along Cypress Creek.
Louisiana immigrant
John Callihan's grant straddled the junction of Big and
Little Cypress creeks, and today would be bounded by Grant,
Spring-Cypress, and Huffmeister roads (American Association
of University Women 1977: 20).
Although documents reveal that other settlers lived
along Cypress Creek before the Texas Revolution, Callihan's
was the only grant actually issued before 1836.
It was not
uncommon, however, for an individual or family to move onto
and improve a piece of property long before they actually
acquired title to it.
On Cypress Creek, the most notable
example of such settlement was that of Matthew Burnett
(also spelled Burnet) and his family.
Claiming a large
amount of land on both sides of Cypress Creek between present­
day Telge and Huffmeister roads, Burnett was patriarch of a
community which represented the earliest-known and most sig­
nificant Anglo settlement on the Creek.
Cursory research revealed little about the Burnett
family prior to their immigration to Texas. According to
one descendant, Crawford Burnett, Jr., three brothers came
to Texas: Matthew, Crawford, and William ([Goodspeed
Brothers Publishers] 1894: 264).
Testimony by Matthew
Burnett and friendly witnesses indicate that he was in Texas
by 1834 (General Land Office File 136, Nueces 59, San
Patricio 1st class; White 1968: 13), in San Felipe in June
of 1836, and was a participant in the Texas Revolution
(White 1968: 48-49.
He had a family comprised of a wife,
Sarah, born in North Carolina in 1798; a son, Alexander,
born in 1819 in Arkansas; and six daughters, Celia, born in

125

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

1834 in Texas; Matilda, born in 1836 in Texas; and Elizabeth,
Fanny, Sally, and Rebecca (United States Census, Harris
County: 1850; General Land Office, Bexar 1st 2021).
By 1836, the Burnett clan was living on land granted to
Matthew's and Sarah's son (?), Alexander, in about 1838.
The
community was in a strategic location astride the Old Washing­
ton Road (now very close to, if not identical with, present­
day Telge Road), a main thoroughfare from Houston to Washing­
ton-on-the-Brazos.
The location of the grant was described
as being about eighteen miles northwest of Houston, and a
sketch which accompanies the General Land Office file shows
that the 6,865,980 square varas lay primarily on the south
side of Cypress Bayou.
The Washington Road cut diagonally
through the western one-third of the grant.
Burnett Settlement was probably the most important early
Anglo settlement along Cypress Creek, and hardly a traveller
left Houston for the northwestern part of Harrisburg Dis~
trict without passing through it and stopping.
On March 22,
1836, William Fairfax Gray stopped at Burnett's where he got
feed for his horses and a meal of beef, butter, milk and
cornbread, as well as better hospitality than his party had
experienced at the rich and famous Jared Groce's (Gray 1965:
143).1
In his analysis of the San Jacinto Campaign, H.M.
Henderson remarked that preparatory to the battle, and after
the army had left the vicinity of New Kentucky, they stopped
with Sam Houston at "Burnett Settlement" on April 17, 1836
(Henderson 1956: 350, Houston 1938: 212).
Gustav Dresel
stopped at Burnett's which he noted was "leased to one Mor­
gan who, for a dollar per night, provides the traveler with
milk, corn bread, and venison, the horse with ten or fifteen
ears of Indian corn in the evening and in the morning."
The bed here consisted of my horse cloth as couch,
the saddle as pillow, and my Mexican rug ~ or
rather cloak, as cover.
I lay down on the floor

Gray remarked that Mrs. Burnett was a widow, but Alexander
Burnett did not die until 1842 (General Land Office Bexar

It is possible that Gray made a mistake, or that
he stopped with one of the brothers' wives.

in front of the chimney and, in my reveries,
passed my experiences in review (Freund 1954:

And advertisement in the TeZegraph and Texas Register
on August 28, 1839, touted the benefits of the road which
led from Houston to Matthew Burnet's [sio] and thence to
McLin Bracey's ferry on the Brazos River 2 miles below Jared
Groce's Plantation; and a year later, Burnett's was used by
the tax collector as the place from which he would be making
collections (TeZegraph and Texas Register October 14, 1840:
3).
Finally, Bishop Odin, on his trip to Texas in January
of 1841, was near Lynchburg and Houston.
On Sunday the
twenty-fourth, he recollected, he and a companion "'dressed
an altar' in their room at Burnett's Tavern on Big Cypress
Creek" (Bayard 1945: 192-195).
For all its notoriety in the second quarter of the
nineteenth century, Burnett's Settlement is disappointingly
unknown today.
Attempts to loeate the site on the ground
failed, although two informants remembered having heard
their parents and uncles mention the community.
According
to Willie Kalbow, Jr., older members of the family had
frequently collected pieces of china in their various fields
on the north side of Cypress Creek when they plowed; and
Chester Telge was able to point out the place where his
father had said the Old Washington Road crossed the creek
(Kalbow 1978, Telge 1978b). Positive site identification,
however, will be possible only after further ground surveying
and archival documentation.
With the victory of Sam Houston's forces at San Jacinto
on April 21, 1836, and the birth of the Republic, the area
included in present-day northwestern Harris County entered a
new era.
The Mexican Municipality of Harrisburg gave way to
Harrisburg County, and then Harris County in 1839.
For a
brief time, in 1841, Cypress Creek and Burnett's Settlement
were included in a judicial county named Spring Creek which
lasted only until 1842, when such districts were declared
unconstitutional.
Most importantly, a land office opened in Houston in
1838 (American Association of University Women 1977: 29),
and with the offering of public lands much of the available

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

property along Cypress Creek was taken up.
Anyone living in
Texas on the day independence was declared was entitled to a
grant~ and literally dozens of lst-, 2nd-, 3rd-, and 4th­
class headrights of a league and labor, or one-third league,
were claimed along the creek by 1840.
Bounty and donation
land grants were available to men who had participated in
the various battles of the Revolution.
However, despite the initial rush to claim their land,
most of the early landowners on Cypress Creek never actually
lived on their property.
George Delesdenier was an absentee
land owner who was a Galveston pilot in 1850.
Benjamin Page
lived in Houston, and Dan'l. Harmon probably lived in
Chambers County (American Association of University Women
1977: 32).
Other similar claimants included Lorenzo de
Zavala, former governor of the state of Mexico, minister to
France, member of the Convention of 1836, signer of the
Declaration of Independence, and ad interim vice-president
of the Republic of Texas; and Pierre J. Menard, delegate to
the 1835 Consultation, participant in the Revolution, and
senior member of the Galveston firm of P.J. Menard and Com­
pany.
Frequently, such claimants saw the land in purely
speculative terms, or as a way of paying debts incurred
during their move to Texas, or during their involvement in
the Revolution.
William Fairfax Gray, especially, noticed
the use of land for speculation by grantees who apparently
felt they were favored with a glut of land.
On February
21, 1836, he wrote that he had met a gentleman named Elijah
Allcorn on the road who tried to sell Gray his league on
Cypress Bayou, formerly the headright of a Dr. Wright [sic],
for fifty cents per acre.
He also wanted to market his own
league on the east side of the Brazos and some other land
adjoinlng~it which -he had purchased earlier.
Gray, impressed
by this free-wheeling approach to property, mentioned two
other parcels for sale by another party at prices ranging
from one to three dollars per acre (Gray 1965: 116).
Ob­
viously, permanent settlement awaited the arrival of another
group of immigrants with different ideas about land.
CYPRESS CREEK, 1846-1940
If the Anglo-American pattern of speculation, absentee
ownership, and general land exploitation along Cypress Creek

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

was typical of the 1830's and 1840's, the German pattern
which developed after statehood in 1846 was vastly different.
Northwestern Harris County needed settlers to help support
the economy of the nearby, newly-burgeoning coastal towns,
and land promoters throughout the state began to enthusias­
tically and aggressively promote emigration from various
European countries.
By 1850, Harris County had a population
that was 30-40% German (Jordan 1975: 51), as individuals
from Posen, Westphalia, Hannover, Prussia, and Saxony fled
in the face of revolutionary movements, Prussian wars of
annexation, and various Polish revolutions for national
independence (Geue 1970: 31).
German land attitudes differed greatly from those of
the Anglo-Americans who preceeded them.
Although they
followed a settlement pattern of dispersed, scattered, or
loosely-clustered farmsteads similar to that practiced by
American farmers, they did tend to settle in fairly close
proximity to one another (Jordan 1975: 55, 94).
This
pattern, coupled with the Germans' tendency to pass on their
land from generation to generation, created an overwhelming
cultural sense of "Germanness" along Cypress and Little Cypress
creeks which continues today.
The area."s~stlarge-com­
munity of permanent residents in almost 100 years, the
Germans in the Cypress Creek vicinity established a pattern
of settlement and land use which is still evident in the
less developed areas along the Creek.
Acquisition of land by Germans along the creeks was
rapid after 1846. Typically, they purchased property which
included Cypress Creek frontage, a portion of the woods
which adjoined the Creek, and as much upland farmland' as
they could afford.
Homes were built well back from the
Creek, while the wooded areas were used primarily as a
resource for firewood, fodder for the numerous sawmills
which sprang up after the Civil War, or shelter and forage
ground for the hogs and cattle which made up a large propor­
tion of the farm stock.
Only rarely did the Germans build
within what is known today as the 100-year floodplain.
As
many informants remarked, "The oldtimers knew just how far
they could go" (Strack 1977, Telge 1977, Borgstedt 1977,
Klein 1977).

129

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

One of the earliest communities of Germans, and one of
the few to immigrate as a group~ was located along Little
Cypress Creek.
The community had its roots in a village in
Posen, Germany, where an organization formed in-1847 for the
purpose of moving to Texas.
The society was comprised of
sixteen families who left Germany on March 25, 1848, and
arrived in Galveston on June 15 (Windwood Presbyterian
Church N.d.: N.p.).
Families included the Krahns, Froelichs,
Winkelmanns, and Fritches.
Intensely religious Lutherans,
they maintained close ties with one another that still exist
today, and take the form now, as in the past, of strong
church and neighborhood loyalties.
The Krahns lived near
Little Cypress, on the north side, and neighbors included
the Hillegeists, whose house was located about 100 yards
down Little Cypress from the bridge which now crosses the
Creek via Cypress-Rosehill Road; the Scheinerfeldts, who
lived on the southwestern side of Little Cypress, across
from Hillegeist's Cemetery; and the Henry Raatz family, who
lived across the Creek from the Krahn's first home.
According to the Anton Krahns, descendants of these
first German settlers, the Little Cypress Creek community
practiced many of the customs they had known in Germany.
(See Carter and Ragsdale 1977 for an equivalent example at
the German community of Biegel's Settlement, Fayette County.)
There were four gun and rifle clubs (Schutz en Verein) - Bear
Creek, White Oak, Spring Branch, and Cypress - the last one
of which was established by the Sons of Hermann. Members
held an annual marksmanship contest, and the best shot was
elected president of the club for that year.
There were
turkey shoots and Sunday shoots, as well as dances twice a
week.
As at Biegel's Settlement~ the club had a German
shooting medal which they awarded for marksmanship.
The Krahns were members of an eight-member beef club
which killed a beef every two weeks.
Each family had its
own place to hang its portion of meat - whether from a tree,
in the hallway of a barn, or in a smokehouse.
.
On Sundays, after church services, neighbors visited
one another.
The men would go together into the fields to
talk about crops, their stock, and their work.
Advice was
freely given and taken in informal meetings which tended to

130

_---------­

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

bond families together and create strong ties in their work,
religion, and recreation (Krahn 1977).
_Qn. both Cypress and Little Cypress creeks, German land
holdings were extensive.
The Telge Family, for exampTe,
--­
came from Hannover, Germany, and settled initially in Spring
Branch.
Eventually, descendants moved to Cypress Creek and
purchased large amounts of acreage out of the Old Alex
Burnett holdings.
They built a home near the present loca­
tion of Cypress-North Houston Road midway between Telge and
Huffmeister roads and ranched and farmed.
Hands were
generally Blacks, and at any given time there were from
twenty to thirty of them helping to raise corn, cotton, and
mules.
Other enterprises included a butcher club and a
sawmill which was located on the old John H. Callihan Grant.
Around the turn of the century, the Wilford Estate sold
about 500 or 700 acres to the Telges who set up the sawmill.
But the mill burned, and the Rodie [1J Family took over the
sawmilling for the area and ran their business just east of
the present intersection of Grant and Jones roads (Telge
1977).
The Johann Peter Borgstedt Family were neighbors of
the Telges and were located immediately east of them.
Johann Peter was born in Westphalia in 1826, immigrated to
Texas, and had registered a cattle brand by 1856. His land,
comprised of 200 acres, was bordered by Cypress Creek on
the north, Huffmeister Road on the east, and Cypress-North
Houston on the south.
He constructed a log cabin in which
his son was born, east of the present location of Knigge
Cemetery.
That son, in turn, constructed a home nearby which
was built in part of lumber milled at Christen's (also
spelled Christian's) Sawmill.
Although a 1915 storm des­
troyed much of this second home, parts of it still serve as
a barn in which notched and pegged members are clearly
visible (Borgstedt 1977).
On the north side of Cypress Creek, Charles Kreigle,
whose wife was descended from an 1845 French immigrant
named Pierre Francois Qualline, ran a sawmill about one-half
mile north of the Creek.
His neighbors included families in
the Klein Community who came to Cypress Creek in the late
1840's and early 1850's, arid the Strack Family who ran a
sawmill on the south side of the Creek.

131

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

Although they were relatively late in coming to Cypress
Creek, the Strack Family typified the German immigrants who
settled there in mid-century.
Five Strack men came to Texas,
and by 1857, one of them, Jacob, had registered a cattle
brand with the Harris County clerk and two years later pur­
chased 139 acres of land (The News September 21, 1977).
Brothers Herman, Frederick, and Henry followed suit with
purchases of land in the Delesdenier, Daniel Harmon, and
Mumford House surveys ([Neal 1977J: N.p.).
Typically, the Strack Family eventually intermarried
with most of the other German families along Cypress Creek,
including the Wunderlichs, Kleins, Hildebrandts, Theisses,
Krahns, Wunsches, Fritsches, Beckendorfs, Baumgartners,
Kuhnles, Glaymeyers, Muellers, Mueschkes, Mittelstedts,
Bammels, and Ehrhardts ([Neal 1976J: N.p.).
Jacob Strack
himself had married Friedricka Mittelstedt in Germany, and
together they ran a sawmill on land purchased in 1888 and
located near their home south of Cypress Creek near the
present-day intersection of Strack and Wunderlich. Workers
included two Black mill hands who were renown for their
work - Henry Cloe (Clow?) who had a two-story, yellow, frame
house on Cloe's Road; and Bill Jeffrey, who lived near the
present location of Klein High School on Steubner-Airline
(Neal 1977).
German families were also scattered along Cypress Creek
in the general vicinity of present-day IH-45.
The Strulaus
located just west of present-day Red Oak Center on FM 1960,
and their land extended north towards the Creek.
Their
daughter married another German immigrant named Burnhardt,
and they built a house about 1901 which was approximately
one-quarter mile north of FM 1960 on the east side of Red
Oak Street.
On their land, which extended from FM 1960 to
Cypress Creek, the Burnhardts farmed and raised cattle,
horses, pigs, and other livestock (Goodson 1978).
Much of the land on Cypress Creek between Westfield and
Humble was acquired and farmed by members of the Theiss and
Hildebrandt families.
The Hildebrandts, for example, pur­
chased property on the north side of the Creek about the
turn of the century and were well-known from Horseshoe Lake
to the present terminus of Treuschwig Road.
Today,

132

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

descendants of the original settlers still raise livestock
and run a butchering business just west of the confluence of
Cypress and Spring creeks (Hildebrandt 1977, Hildebrandt
1978).
Although Germans were probably the most numerous
ethriic group among the early Cypress Creek settlers, they
were by no means the only ones.
Today, the sites of two
large settlements of Black residents are still marked by
cemeteries, and although little is known about them, they
appear to date from the post-Civil War period.
The first of these early Black communities was located
on the north side of Cypress Creek along Treuschwig Road.
The patriarch of the group seems to have been a man named
Seal McDougal, an ex-slave who at one time owned approxi~
mately 1,100 acres and from whom T. Hildebrandt purchased
his property.
Ed Butler was a wealthy neighbor who the
Hi1debrandts remembered as having owned a considerable
amount of property and having lived in a large and magnifi­
cent house located between the Hildebrandt's present home
and Cypress Creek (Hildebrandt 1978).
Today, the most
visible evidence that the area was once predominantly Black
is McDougal's tombstone, the only marker remaining after a
developer bull-dozed the remainder of the cemetery in the
process of constructing a subdivision.
Another large Negro community was located near Faulkey
Gully, also on the north side of Cypress Creek.
According
to published information, the Blacks who settled in "The
Bottoms ll were freedmen who disembarked at the Galveston
docks and followed German immigrants inland (American
Association of University Women 1977: 40).
At least one
local informant remembers having been told of a group of
Blacks who frequented a spring on Cypress Creek just east of
Faulkey Gully, some of whom died there of cholera.
Other
Negroes who had settled at Camp Holden washed their clothes
at the spring. While only the cemetery on Faulkey Gully
remains today to mark the general location of what might have
once been a large population, at least one report. exists of
a Black church somewhere in the vicinity as well (Anderson
1977).

133

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

As might be expected, Negro and German settlement along
Cypress and Little Cypress creeks followed definite and identi~_
fiable patterns.
Land tended to be held by single groups
of related families who preferred to own a comgination of
creek frontage, woodlands, and prairie farm land.
They used
the forested areas, which were frequently within the flood­
plain, as sources of firewood, and most importantly, as
fodder for the numerous sawmills which sprang up after the
Civil War and were run by Telge, Jeanses [?J, Strack,
Holston, Kreigle, Kapner/Townsend, .Puryear and Laird, and
Kleb and Theiss, to name a few.
Houses, located well back from the Creek were, in many
cases, built on the extreme edges of the floodplain.
It is
apparent that the early settlers knew approximately how high
the water rose during periodic floods and, unlike contempo­
rary residents, had a healthy respect for the seemingly
innocuous Creek.
Interestingly enough, however, nineteenth-century
residents often buried their dead within reach of flood
waters.
In fact, of all the types of historic sites, with
the possible exception of sawmills, cemeteries were located
most frequently in the floodplain.
Examples of such sites
include two Negro cemeteries out of three located, and
seven German:
Mueller, Knigge, Borgstedt, Kluge, Zahn
Family (within the 1977 revised 100-year estimate), Kolbe­
Rumpel, and Kuehnle.
While the bulk of the Cypress Creek watershed was
inhabited by German, Negro, and French settlers·who farmed
and owned large numbers of mixed livestock, the remainder
of the Creek - that area to the west of present-day Highway
290 and the Houston and Texas Central Railroad - had its own
special pattern of settlement and land use.
West of the
line cut by these two important transportation routes was a
vast relatively level prairie where few trees grew.
Most
of this land was ideally suited to ranching, and the pattern
established by 1870 was one of large Anglo-Saxon landholdings
with many house sites placed well within a broad floodplain.
Earliest cattlemen in this northwestern portion of
Harris County included Austin colonist Abram Roberts, and
Joseph House, grandson of another Austin colonist who ~.

134

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

settled along Spring Creek (American Association of
University Women 1977: 54).
The best-known rancher in the
area, and the one whose family has had longest tenure along
the western stretches of Cypress Creek was John Warren who
migrated from Cumberland County, England, in the early
1850's, sailed for Texas, and landed at Galveston.
At first, Warren rao . a stage. stand near the M0tlt:gomery
County line, but soon he bega.~ to acquire livestock--:-·· He- --"'---­
made one brief visit to England and then returned to Texas
in 1857, when he settled near Hockley (Brown [189-7J: 552­
553).
By that time, the Houston and Texas Central Railroad
had extended its line through Cypress Top to Hockley itself,
and the prosperity the railroad brought with it probably had
much to do with Warren's choice of a place to live.
He
opened an eating house and inn which soon became famous for
its excellent food, and he gained a reputation as a bird
hunter which drew other gamesmen from allover the state
(Young 1913: 34-35).
With his profits, Warren gradually acquired cattle
and bought up about 6,500 acres which lay in Harris, Mont­
gomery, and Waller counties. He built a frame house which
still stands as the ranch headquarters and ran the large
spread with a son, John, born in Hockley on February 17,
1861 (Davis and Grobe N.d.: 718).
Typically, cattle were
loaded on the railroad at Hockley and shipped to New Orleans,
but another large market existed in Kansas, where the steers
were often shipped for winter grazing (Jordan 1977).
With time, the Warrens diversified and raised cotton,
_ _~~c~o~r~n~'L and other crops.
The family began to cultivate rice
in the late 1930 t s, while another source of income was the
salt dome that was originally located in 1905, explored in
1928, and fully developed in the 1940's (Stenzel 1946: 214).
The mine was serviced by two railroads:
one to Katy, which
is now abandoned, and the other one to Hockley (Jordan 1977).
m

- - - ­

While information about other early ranch holdings
west of the railroad is vague and incomplete at best, it is
apparent from field investigations that at least one other
ranch may have been contemporaneous with the Warren Ranch.
On the eastern portion of the prairie, between House and
Hah1 Road and Cypress Creek, are the remains of what is

135

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

known as the Roberts House.
Artifacts inspected at the now­
destroyed site demonstrate a period of long use which could
have begun as early as the mid-19th century.
TodaYt inforT
mants know nothing of the Roberts Family, but describe the
former home as having been a large t two-story frame struc­
ture, built high off the ground.
A brand collected by one
informant was registered to the Roberts name and used some­
time around the period of the Civil War (Curry 1978, Dolan
1978).
Around the turn of the century, a number of the large
ranch holdings seem to have been sold to new owners such as
the House Family, whose ranch lay just west of Highway 290
on the south side of Cypress Creek; the Will Hager Ranch,
which was located just south of the present-day Josey Ranch;
and the Anderson Ranch, which ran to 529 and west almost to
Katy-Hock1ey Road, and was purchased in later years by the
Josey- Family (Dolan 1978).
While many of the people who owned property west of
Highway 290 were strictly cattle raisers, others diversified
and began to raise rice.
The Longenbaughs, for example,
were located southeast of the Warren Ranch, and purchased a
large amount of land which they used to grow rice almost
exclusively.
A member of the family, Mrs. Alta Longenbaugh,
her own family from Iowa, recalls that they acquired the core
of their holdings about 1933 or 1934, and slowly added to
the ranch by buying surrounding acreage as it became avail­
able. Most of the land was acquired from other Midwestern
owners who had purchased it sight unseen from real estate
developers who had subdivided a large ranch sometime before
1930 (Longenbaugh 1978).2
The intensive rice cultivation which has occurred in
the past forty to fifty years, has been responsible for the
destruction of many historic sites, such as the Roberts
House, as plows have dug deeply, turning the earth over and
leveling it in preparation for planting.
Consequently,
material remains of historic houses on the prairie west of

This pattern of subdivision and speculation was especially
prevalent in Texas around 1900-1910.
See Freeman 1976 for a
similar example in Williamson County.

136

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

Highway 290 are infrequent, leaving archival research and
oral history among the only means for recovering historical
data about a portion of Cypress Creek that must have been
rich in sites prior to the 1930's.
Summary and Recommendations
Historic settlement in the Cypress Creek flood plain
and surrounding areas can be said to date from the time of
written records which resulted from Spanish contact with
aboriginal Orcoquiza groups in 1719, although such records
are understandably vague.
And even later manuscripts dating
from Spanish exploration of the mid-eighteenth century do
not provide the detail needed to positively locate the sites
of historic Orcoquiza settlements.
However, it is clear
from these records that at least one Spanish rancho and
several semi-permanent Indian camps did exist in northwestern
Harris County; one of them was located near the confluence
of Spring and Cypress creeks.
More detailed records of historic settlements resulted
from the initiation of Austin's colonization efforts, and
there are descriptions in the 1830's and 1840's of Anglo
settlements and single habitations such as Burnett's Settle­
ment or the residence of Pasca11 B. Hamblin.
Still, exact
loeations are rarely provided, and Harris County maps from
the nineteenth century are surprisingly scarce.
Of all historic settlements, the German are easiest
to locate, for whether or not they can be readily documented
by other means, they were inhabited by families which were
unusually stable and frequently unusually interested in the
histories of their families and the locations of sites
associated with them.
While memories may grow vague,
information elicited about sites as much as 100 or 125 years
old have often been remarkably accurate and easily substan­
tiated by field checks.
Today, northwestern Harris County is being rapidly and
cataclysmically changed.
Sites that existed weeks ago are
now gone as subdivisions build up to the banks of Cypress
Creek. Frequently, hard-to-locate sites~ such as the van­
dalized McDougal Cemetery, have been destroyed in the process,

137

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

and despite the efforts of a local genealogical group, there
are undoubtedly dozens of cemeteries which are similarly
threatened.
In addition, there are literally dozens of
sites which may be mentioned only in one source.
On the
United States Department of the Interior Cypress Quadrangle
map published in 1918, for example, numerous sites are
marked which have not been otherwise documented or located
by the Texas Archeological Survey, and which informants in
the field never mentioned.
An inspection of files at the Texas Historical Commis­
sion in Austin has revealed that there are no sites within
the survey area on the National Register of Historic Places,
nor are there sites designated with historic markers.
How­
ever, the dearth of such designations has clearly been the
result of a lack of comprehensive surveying and reporting.
Because one month was allotted for field investigations
of all kinds, whether research or observation, the depth of
reconnaissance was necessarily limited and superficial.
However, research in the Barker Texas History Center (The
University of Texas at Austin), the Texas State Library,
Harris County Courthouse, and County Engineer's Office, as
well as field investigation and numerous conversations with
informants, has revealed that Cypress Creek, if lacking in
examples of standing historic structures, is rich in
archeological sites, despite construction of subdivisions
and other commercial developments.
Aside from the obvious importance of single sites such
as Burnett's Settlement, there are at least four portions
of the Cypress Creek floodp~airi which are especially vulner­
able to present historical activity:
1. West of Highway 290, in the land encompassed by the
Warren, Longenbaugh, and Josey ranches, there are indications
that the remains of numerous structures may still exist.
Almost all of these appear to date from the late nineteenth
century, but very little of a specific nature is known about
them.
More importantly, almost nothing is known of the
historic development of nineteenth-century ranching in the
area as exemplified by the Roberts House site.

138

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

2.
The German settlements along Little Cypress Creek
are among the earliest within the Cypress Creek area, and
while there are other such settlements in Texas which are in
better condition architecturally, the Little Cypress Creek
communities may provide much information archeologically.
3.
A very sensitive area exists along the eastern
portion of Cypress Creek from Hardy Road to the junction of
Spring and Cypress creeks.
Site of early freed-Black settle­
ment, the area seems to have been home for several financial­
ly outstanding freedmen.
The possibility that early house
remains still exist suggests that the area should be the
focus of archeological surveying and intensive archival
research.
4.
Finally, there is a clear danger which exists
concerning the numerous historic cemeteries located along
the entire length of Cypress Creek.
To date, ten cemeteries
have been documented.
It is likely that they represent only
a fraction of the total.
Within these sensitive areas, there are a number of
sites which could have potential National Register status,
including the Warren Ranch Headquarters (in the watershed,
not the floodplain), Hot Wells Hotel complex, Blackman
House (watershed), Windwood Presbyterian Church, and
Burnett's Settlement.
However, the suggestion that such
sites are of National Register quality is not only extremely
tentative, but should not be interpreted to imply that they
are the only such possible sites.
The area on the extreme
eastern edge of the flood plain has, again, been so sketchily
surveyed that the possibility that there may be important
sites in the vicinity can only be decided after further work.
In 1978, Cypress Creek's most vulnerable historical
resource is its older residents, and with each month, more
of them move to other areas.
It is bighly recommended,
therefore, that should further work be necessary in the
Cypress Creek floodplain, a first priority should be the
interviewing of as many local informants as possible.
The
information collected from such contacts, combined with that
obtained through careful deed research in the Harris County

139

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

as well as the means for assessing the relative importance
of specific sites.
Historic Sites on Cypress Creek ­
A Preliminary List of Located Sites and
Unlocated, Documented Sites.
A cursory survey of Cypress Creek and the immediate
vicinity in northwest Harris County resulted in the locating
of forty historic sites or areas of historical interest.
The majority of these sites were located in the field, and
their histories substantiated and briefly documented in
personal interviews, printed publications, early newspapers,
records of the General Land Office. maps, and county record~ _ _
among other sources.
No definitive history of any of the
sites was attempted, but sufficient information about them
was gathered so that the importance of sites relative to one
another, and their place in the history of the development
of Cypress Creek could be ascertained. (See Fig~:22)
Other historic remains near Cypress Creek were sites
whose presence had been recorded in various ways, but which
could not be or were not actually found.
Such sites may be
located with the aid of further research, coupled with more
field work.
Historic sites on or near Cypress Creek were of several
different types.
These included cemeteries, houses,
churches, sawmills, roads and crossings, bridges, s
railroads, stagestops, and resorts.
They were spread along
the entire length of the Creek, although the bulk of them
were found in the area between Highway 290 and IH 45,
largely because of the area's relatively greater accessibil~
ity. Many of the sites lay on the very edge of the flood­
plain, a phenomenon so prevalent, in fact, that the limits
of the floodplain could almost be said to be defined by the
limits of historical settlement.
However, a significant
number of other sites lay immediately adjacent to the Creek,

or well within the study area.
Sites within the area, or
close to it, included the following:
CEMETERIES - LOCATED
1. Kolbe-Rumpel Cemetery, located within the flood­
plain on the south side of Cypress Creek between Highway 290
and Telge Road, was used from 1901 to 1936.
Family names
on the tombstones include Kolbe, Springborn, Rumpel, Neal,
and Patchen, at least two of which are important German
names in the development of Cypress Creek.
The Kolbes were
related to members of the Telge Family for whom Telge Road
was named; the Rumpels appear to have been among the second­
generation immigrants who entered Harris County after the
Civil War.
A Department of the Interior map for Harris
County, Cypress Quadrangle, Edition of 1918, includes indica­
tions that two structures existed in the vicinity of( the
cemetery.
Further archival and field research may locate
and identify the structures, and reveal whether or not they
have any obvious connection with the families interred in
the Kolbe-Rumpel Cemetery.
2. Mueller Cemetery, located within the floodplain
on the south side of Cypress C~eek between Highway 290 and
Tel
Road is a German cemetery which dates from 1896.
es nterre
re were members of the Hi11igiest,
Muller (also spelled Miller), and McCarty families. Members
of the Muller family still live in the immediate vicinity of
the cemetery, while "Hilligiest" may simply be a modern ver­
sion of the spelling, "Hilligeist," an old family on Little
Cypress Creek, whose presence in the person of Oscar
Hilligeist was recorded in the Harris County Road Records
as early as 1862 (Harris County, County Commissioner,
Record Roads Vol. 1: 7, 10), and whose house was located
about 100 yards down Little Cypress Creek from the Cypress­
Rose Hill -troad Bridge (Krahn 1977).
3.
An unidentified Negro cemetery lies in the flood­
plain in an unmarked area north of the intersection of
Skinner Road and Highway 290.
This site is extremely vul­
nerable because it is not well marked or protected by
fencing of any kind.
Although marked burials (including the
interments of John Solomon, Ola Mae Solomon, and members of

the Jackson Family) appear to have all occurred within the
last six years, there are indications that the area excludes
other, unmarked graves.
A local informant has stated that
the cemetery has had long usage, and its location is well­
known among members of the area's Black community (Kalbow

1978).
4.
Zahn Family Cemetery is located on property which
has been deeded to Harris County_ While lying outside of
the project area, being near the end of K-Z Road on the north
side of Cypress Creek, the cemetery does lie within the 100­
year floodplain as marked during the fall of 1977 (Zahn 1978).
The cemetery includes both marked and unmarked graves and ,_
served as the burial plot for numerous members of the early
Little Cypress Creek German community, including the Zahns,
Froelichs, Meyers, and Raatzs.
The oldest stone dates from
1878 and is that of Jake Zahn's great-great-grandfather,
Andreas Zahn, born in 1798.
5.
Knigge Cemetery lies within the designated flood­
plain on the south side of Cypress Creek at the end of
Knigge Cemetery Road.
It is owned by members of the Telge
Family and carefully maintained within the confines of a
chainlink fence.
Buried in the cemetery are members of the
Gerloff, Hoffman, Baatz, Telge, Kolbe, Knigge, Steinhagen,
Scholz, and Bitner families, some of whom, such as the
Telges and Kolbes, are related by marriage.
The earliest
burial in the Knigge Cemetery, and one of the oldest marked
graves in the entire Cypress Creek area, is that of J.H.
Friederich Knigge, born in Hannover on July 9, 1824, and
died on
ress Creek on October 24 1868.
6.
Borgstedt Cemetery is located within the floodplain
on the south side of Cypress Creek just east of Huffmeister
Road.
Like the Knigge Cemetery, the Borgstedt Cemetery is
privately owned and maintained.
Interments include members
of families from both the Cypress and Little Cypress: Bor~stedt,
Zahn, Teske, Ojemann, Koepke (Kopke), and Kluge, the last
of which also has family members interred in the Kluge
Family Cemetery north of Cypress Creek.
The oldest tomb­
stone is that of Johann Peter Borgstedt, -born in Westphalia,
Germany, on May 22, 1826, and died on September 24, 1891,
who was in Harris County by 1856 and constructed a log cabin
(now gone) about .2 miles east of Knigge Cemetery (Borgstedt

1977).

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

7.
A Negro cemetery located in the Lakewood Forest
Subdivision near Fau1key Gully in the floodplain is the best
preserved of the three Negro cemeteries found in or near the
project area.
It is protected by a chain1ink fence, but may
be endangered either by future development within the sub­
division or by flooding since it is so close to Fau1key
Gully.
Family names include Williams, B1acksteck, Green,
Raymond, Amsted, Patterson, and Woods, Woods being predom­
inant.
The most recent burial appears to have taken place
in the mid-1930·s; the first marked grave is that of Polly
Raymond, who died in 1887(7). Many of the gravestones are
formed from cement, and have pertinent information incised
in the surface.
Local informants have indicated that a church may have
been located nearby, and remember that the area had a good­
sized Black population (Anderson 1977; AAUW 1977: 40).
The
possibility that there was a Negro settlement in the vicini­
ty of the cemetery makes the area a potentially sensitive
one, archeo10gica11y speaking.
8.
(McDougal) Cemetery remains are located north of
Treuschwig Road east of the North Fork of Wild Cow Gulch.
The most prominent headstone left is that of Seal McDougal,
the remaining graves and markers having been destroyed when
a subdivision was created and a four-lane entrance con­
structed through the cemetery bounds.
The McDougal stone is
one of the few traces remaining of what a white informant
has remarked was once a very large Negro community along
Treuschwig Road (Hildebrandt 1978).
Further research and
field work is to be highly recommended for this sensitive
and potentially rich portion of Cypress Creek; development
near the terminus of the Creek has been less intense than in
many other parts of the survey area, and the chances of
identifying and excavating structures associated with Texas·
Negro culture, correspondingly higher.
SAWMILLS - LOCATED
9.
Te1ge Sawmill can be tentatively placed on the
south bank of Cypress Creek about .2 miles east of East
Shadow1awn Road.
According to Chester Te1ge, whose family
operated the business, the mill was established in the

145

1890's on part of the Callihan Grant.
The mill burned up,
leaving only the iron boiler.
However, there is no trace of
such heavy equipment on the site as located, heavy iron
cable being among the few artifacts noted, and unless other
remains exist elsewhere in the area, little indication exists
today of what was apparently a thriving business.
HOUSES AND HOUSE SITES - LOCATED
10. Warren Ranch Headquarters, located outside the
floodplain limits on the north side of Cypress Creek, is the
headquarters for one of the four largest ranches remaining
in the western Cypress Creek area.
It is comprised of
several homes, as well as work buildings, the oldest struc­
ture being the house built by John Warren.
There have been
numerous additions to the core of the original house, and
the family is unsure of the construction date, but it re­
mains one of the oldest continually-occupied houses in the
Cypress Creek area.
11.
Roberts House, located on the south side of Cypress
Creek west of the House and Hahl Road bridge crossing the
Creek, was located within the floodplain.
Its original
siting on a rise, however, kept it out of flood waters.
Recent rice cultivation has destroyed most of what remained,
scattering brick widely.
But artifacts viewed in the field
date from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries.
12. Unidentified house site, located about .2 miles
east of the Roberts House, may have been associated with it.
It has been similarly destroyed, but observed artifacts date
from the same period as the earliest noted around Roberts
House.
13. Hubert House, formerly south of Cypress Creek, west
of Highway 290, and north of the present Curry Home, has
been destroyed by plowing and bulldozing for rice cultiva~
tion.
The structure probably dated from the early nineteenth
century, but without archival research, it would be difficult
to ascribe a date on the basis of field observations.
14.
Hot Wells Addition, lying within the floodplain on
the east side of Highway 290 immediately south of Cypress

146

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

Creek, is in the general vicinity of the Knigge Homestead.
While there has been no record found yet of houses being
built in the Addition, preparation was made for such a
development.
According to Peter Borgstedt, numerous people
from the North bought lots, and his father hauled shell from
Cypress in order to make the roads (Borgstedt 1977).
The
development may have occurred about the same time ranches
along Cypress Creek west of Highway 290 were being sub­
divided; outlines of roads and lots are still visible from
the air.
15.
Knigge Homestead site is located within the flood­
plain on the south side of Cypress Creek.
It is visible
from Highway 290 on the east just before 290 crosses the
Creek. According to a descendant of the original owner, a
house was built on the site about seventy-five years ago by
Martin Knigge.
Today, the house is gone, but corrals,
chutes, and numerous sheds mark the general vicinity of the
former residence.
16. Adam Mueller House, located in the floodplain on
the south side of Cypress Creek about .2 miles east of
Mueller Cemetery Road, is an undistinguished white frame
structure, notable primarily because it is one of the older
buildings remaining in the Cypress Creek area.
According
to an informant, the house was constructed around 1900, but
architectural evidence indicates a date as much as twenty
years later (Kalbow 1978).
17. Granny Alice's Home, located within the floodplain
on the north side of Cypress Creek adjacent to Telge Road,
was the home of a Black woman who worked for the Telge
Family.
The house was built for her by one of the Telges;
a structure on the site appears as early as 1918 on the
United States Department of the Interior Cypress Quadrangle
Map.
18.
The Kalbow Homestead, located outside of the
floodplain on the north side of Cypress Creek, was con.
structed c. 1898 on land given to Louisa Telge Kalbow by her
father.
The core of the frame house consisted of four large
rooms and a central hallway; subsequent additions included a
room and pantry around World War I and another room and
pantry sometime later.
Outbuildings, all of which are in

147

HISTORIC SITES

excellent condition, include a barn~ corn crib, and several
miscellaneous structures.
The house has been continuously
occupied by the Kalbows since its construction, but its
future is uncertain because of rising land taxes and the
imminent construction of a large development nearby.
19.
Kolbe Homestead, located on the border of the
floodplain, was built by George Telge's maternal grand­
parents.
The house, now owned by the Burkett Family, has
been enclosed by a barn.
Originally, there was a kitchen
on the back, and an open porch on the front.
20.
Kluge Home, located in the floodplain on the south
corner of Kluge and Huffmeister roads, is an undistinguished,
one-story, white, frame structure with an attic which appears
to date from the period 1910 to 1920.
Information from Mrs.
Fritz Hildebrandt (nee Kluge) that the house her family
lived in waS built twelve years before they arrived in Texas
in 1890, suggests that there is a significantly older house
site in the vicinity.
21.
Blackman House, located outside the floodplain
about .2 miles north of the intersection of Telge and Huff­
meister roads, is possibly the oldest standing structure in
the Cypress or Little Cypres~ cr~eks area o
The or inal site of
~EheEouse was closertot'he woods near
tt e
press
reek,
and the structure has been moved only recently by the present
owners.
The Blackman House is sited just north of the Cypress
Creek floodplain, but it is significant because it may be
typical of the older "second generation" houses constructed
in the general vicinity.
The building rests on piers, and
it is one-story, frame, with an attic.
The windows are six
over six and there probably are wooden shingles under the
present composition roof.
Numerous additions have been made
to the rear of the building.
22.
Raif House lies within the floodplain about 2,000
feet north of Cypress Creek and east of West Montgomery Road.
Present owners were uninformative concerning the history of
the house and property, but the United States Department of
the Interior Cypress Quad, Edition of 1918, does reveal that
a structure was standing on the site at that date •

RAILROADS - LOCATED
23.
The old railroad grade west of Highway 290 runs
in a southerly direction across Cypress Creek from the
vicinity of the salt mine on the Warren Ranch.
Now aban­
doned, the track was used once to carry salt from the mine
to Katy.
RESORTS - LOCATED
24.
Hot Wells, located south of Cypress on the north
side of Cypress Creek, began as a result of the Humble oil
boom of 1904. Wi~dcatters drilled wells across Harris
County, but at Cypress, instead of hitting mil, they found
a hot, free-flowing artesian well. The pools of water that
formed found formal expression in the Houston Hot Wells
Sanitarium and Hotel, and for years, pleasure-seekers from
Houston rode the excursion train to the hotel to take hot
mineral baths (AAUW 1977: 58-59), much as they had gone to
Hockley to eat at John Warren's inn years before.
The resort was also immensely popular with the area's
residents, many of whom remember that they used to "live
there" as children.
Today, the grounds operate as a shooting
range, and although the pools still remain, the hotel is
gone, burned in the late 1960's.
CHURCHES - LOCATED
25.
Windwood Presbyterian Church, located in the
floodplain on the north side of Cypress Creek just west of
Grant Road, was originally called St. John's Lutheran Church.
It was constructed in 1915, the third such St. John's to
serve Cypress Creek's German population.
Eventually, it was
purchased by the Windwood Presbyterian Church and moved to
its present location after the Lutheran congregation grew
too large for the relatively small sanctuary.
Although the
building itself is only some sixty years old, it is said to
contain church furnishings made by the St. John's Lutheran
congregation for one of the earlier churches.

ROADS AND CROSSINGS -

LOCATED

26.
Burnett's Road and Crossing, located in the
floodplain on the south side of Cypress Creek immediately
east of Telge Road, is the most famous crossing in the
Cypress Creek floodplain.
In the first half of the nine­
teenth century, the road was commonly known as the Old
Washington Road, but as various members of the Burnett
Family began to settle in the vicinity, the name of the
crossing and the portion of the road near Burnett's Tavern
became associated with that family's name.
The road re­
mained one of the more important routes from Houston, and
the crossing one of the most frequently used along the
Creek.
27.
K~,kendall [sio] Crossing, within the Cypress
Creek floodplain, originally provided a crossing on the
Creek for a road which went to Egypt Crossing on Spring
Creek.
The road was adopted in February of 1890, and the
site is now known as Kuykendahl Road.
28.
Wunsche Crossing in the Cypress Creek floodplain,
was part of a public road leading from Cypress to Spring
creeks.
The road was adopted in August 1888; today it is
part of East Montgomery Road.
29.
Spring Creek and Cross Timber Road, part of which
lay within the floodplain, was adopted in February 1892.
Today, it is known as the Aldine Westfield Road.
SCHOOLS - LOCATED
30.
Big Cypress School, located within the floodplain,
was near the southwest corner of the intersection of Telge
and Cypress North Houston roads.
According to an informant,
the school was built on land which was given by a member of
the Telge Family, which also provided a schoolhouse for the
Black children in the neighborhood. (Telge 1977).

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

CEMETERIES - DOCUMENTED, UNLOCATED
31.
Kluge Cemetery lies within the floodplain in the
same general vicinity as the Kluge Home, and may derive its
name from proximity to the house since the Kluges were
buried in the Borgstedt Cemetery.
Clarise Borgstedt has
recorded the tombstones within the cemetery, and the site
is well-known to members of the Chapparrel Genealogical
Society of Harris County.
32. Mosbrucker Cemetery is located in the floodplain
south of Cypress Creek and west of Kuykendahl Road.
Accord­
ing to an informant, the cemetery is probably located on
property which formerly belonged to the Richey Family, many
of whose members are also buried in the Ehrhardt Cemetery.
The Mosbrucker Cemetery dates from 1882; the most recent
burial occurred in 1952 (Strack 1977).
SAWMILLS - DOCUMENTED, UNLOCATED
33.
Anderson Sawmill, located in the floodplain south
of the intersection of Faulkey Gully and Cypress Creek, was
recorded in 1918 on the United States Department of the
Interior Cypress Quadrangle Map.
34.
Kapner/Townsend Sawmill was located in the flood­
plain immediafel~ southeast of the pbint where Steubner
Airline Road crosses Cypress Creek (Kl.b 1978).
Neighboring
sawmills to the west, located outside the floodplain, were
the better-known Strack mills which operated from approxi­
mately 1888 on (Neal 1977).
35.
Holston Sawmill was located in the floodplain on
the north side of Cypress Creek west of the Chicago Rock
Island Railroad.
According to Thornwell Kleb~c it was in
operation in the late 1800's (Kleb 1978).
36. Kreigle Sawmill was located near the edge of the
floodplain on the north side of Cypress Creek, west of
Steubner-Airline Road.
According to Thornwell Kleb's grand­
mother, the Kreigle Mill began operation in 1872 and was
located one-half mile north of Cypress Creek, "about!:! mile
back of the negro Jeffries which is now all big trees.

small cemetery was made there also, the old man Henry Keiser
[her grandfather] and a baby sister of this writer were there,
the baby sister had a small tombstone which might yet be
found among the big trees." Grandma Kleb also remarked that
after ten years, "The timber was just about all sawed
out • • • " (Kleb 1978).
37.
A sawmill on the former Tautenhahn property [Stone
Gully Sawmill?] has been tentatively identified and placed
west of Hardy Road on the south bank of Cypress Creek
(Strack 1977, Hildebrandt 1977).
38.
[Snyder?] Sawmill and Bridge have been placed in
the floodplain on the south side of Cypress Creek west of
Tettar [sic] Road.
According to one informant, many members
of the Snyder Family worked in the mill, but he was not
certain that they actually owned the property (Hildebrandt
1978).
HOUSES AND HOMESITES - DOCUMENTED, NOT LOCATED
39.
Bains Ranch lay within the Cypress Creek floodplain
south of the Creek and west of Highway 290.
The 1918 United
States Department of the Interior Cypress Quadrangle map
notes structures in the vicinity of what might be the Josey
Ranch today.
40.
Unidentified structures are located in the flood­
plain south of Cypress Creek on the 1918 United States
Department of the Interior Cypress Quadrangle Map.
Their
proximity to the Kolbe-Rumpel Cemetery suggests that they
might in some way be associated with it.
41.
The Ed Butler Home was located between the end of
Treuschwig Road and Cypress Creek.
Vague directions by an
informant who now owns the property indicated only that this
Black homesite was located in a south pasture.
However, his
description of it suggested that it was a large, if not
sumptuous and important structure in the area, and more
efforts should be made to locate it more exactly (Hildebrandt
1978).

HISTORICAL RESOURCES

BRIDGES - DOCUMENTED, NOT LOCATED
42.
A logging bridge was located within the Cypress
Creek floodplain west of Steubner-Airline Road.
Informants
were able to give only the vaguest directions (Neal 1977),
but its location relative to the Strack mills suggests it
was used by that business.
HISTORIC SPRINGS - DOCUMENTED, NOT LOCATED
43.
An informant tentatively located a nineteenth­
century spring on an old cut of Cypress Creek east of the
junction of the Creek and Faulkey Gully.
He recollected
that his grandfather had mentioned a camp of soldiers there,
as well as a temporary settlement of Blacks (Anderson 1977)
which may have been associated in some manner with the
cemetery in present-day Lakewood Forest Subdivision.
STAGE STOP - DOCUMENTED, NOT LOCATED
44.
A possible stage stop was located within the
floodplain bounds on the south side of Cypress Creek between
Telge and Huffmeister roads.
Information concerning the
stop comes only from one informant, whose father told him
about the site, pointed it out, and remembered having
collected numerous sherds in the vicinity (Telge 1977).
No
such site appears on any maps, but further archival and field
work may yield information.
The informant volunteered similar information about a
possible historic Indian burial site between the stage stop
and Cypress Creek.
However, his information was again
second-hand.

Acknowledgements
Northwestern Harris County is changing and growing at
an unprecedented rate. While such growth has been accompanied
by far~reaching economic benefits~ some of the social impli­
cations have not been so positive. Historians frequently
must rely heavily on local informants whose families have
resided in the survey area for extended periods of time.
The fact that so many of these families had left north­
western Harris County did not bode well for the successful
gathering of certain types of information during the course
of the Cypress Creek survey.
Fortunately, sufficient numbers of informants were
still holding tenaciously to property that had once belonged
to grandparents and great-grandparents.
In addition,
there has been a recent and encouraging interest on the part
of old=timers and new residents in preserving what remains of
Cypress Creek's historical heritage. Mrs. Evans of the Tomball
Museum, for example, was able to provide a regional perspective
on historical events, while Mrs. Mary Holt Kimball and the
American Association of University Women made available the
information they had gathered in the process of compiling a
fine history of northwestern Harris County. Mrs. Rebecca
Strack provided invaluable information on the area's
cemeteries.
Numerous other long-time residents pointed out specific
historic sites. Mr. Chester Telge and Mrs. Sadie Curry were
especially helpful in this regard.
Other informants include
Mrs. Tom Jordan, Sr., Mrs. Clarise Borgstedt, Bud and Dallas
Lamar, and Mrs. Alta Longenbaugh, all of whom live or own
land west of U.S. Highway 290.
On Little Cypress Creek, the
Krahn and Zahn families provided hospitality and point out
house, church, and cemetery locations.
Finally, a large
number of individuals helped assemble information about
the portion of Cypress Creek between Highways 290 and 45:
Gottlieb Knigge, Raymond Anderson, Catherine Neal, Thornwell
Kleb, Willie Kalbow, Jr., Fritz Hildebrandt, and Mrs.
Albert Kitzmann. East of Highway 45, Mr. ArIes Hildebrandt
noted the presence of early Negro homes and cemeteries.
In Houston, I received help at the Clayton Library,
Houston Metropolitan Archives, and the County Courthouse.
Outstanding information came from Mr. Johnny Gunter, County

161

Engineer's Office, whose far~sightedness and love of Harris
County history has resulted in the preservation of numerous
nineteenth and early twentieth-century road maps.
In Austin, I received the usual cooperation and assistance
from the staffs of the Texas Historical Commission, the Texas
State Library, General Land Office, and Barker Texas History
Center at the The University of Texas at Austin.

PART III. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This page intentionally left blank.

General Summary and Recommendations
A reconnaissance survey of portions of the Cypress Creek
basin herein reported has, in our opinion, d~monstrated that
substantial and potentially dmportant .cultural resources do
e~istin the study area.
These investigations were focused
on the area encompassed by: the defined 10.0 year flood limits
of Cypress Creek and immediately contiguous uplands.*
Prehistoric

.Reaou~ces

Methods utilized in designing and implementing a 20%
random sampling of the8a-square ~ile area within the study
area have been detailed in Part I of this report. This
coverage has resulted in the discovery or further documentation
of 58 prehistoric sites of various ages.
In all cases where
age estimates were possible they were based on typological
evidence (i.e. the preserice of time-diagnostic artifact forms
or styles, such as dart points, arrow points or aboriginal
ceramics).
Because of the comparably scanty cultural
residues visible from surface examination and light subsurface
testing only 42% of the archeological sites were assigned age
other than "prehistoric ll •
The possibility of certain of
these localities representing historic (post-European contact)
native American occupation of the Cypress Creek area does
exist, although direct evidence, such as the association of
early historic European manufactured materials,'was'not found.
As has been pointed out, the study area has produced cultural
material which probably dates from the late Paleoindian
Pe rio d (a iraa 6,000-8,000 B .Q.), various phases 0 f the
succeeding Archaic Per~od, and, as indicated by the presence
of various arrow point styles and pottery, the Late Prehistoric
Period.
The results of the survey indicate that site density is
fairly high in the areas inspected.
This characterization
is subjective, however, in that few surveys have been
reported in geographically comparable areas.
Cypress Creek
lies in what might be termed a IItransitional" area between
coastal and inland zones and is one of the least sampled
areas of the state.
Calculat~d per unit, density and frequency
as reflected in our sample are quantified and discussed in
Part I.

SUMMARY. AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Where determinable the sites are small and appear to
reflect general camping activitie~.
Site function, an issue
of great archeologicll con~ein, .eouldnot be. ~etermined with
any reasonable. degree of .confidence hecause of the limited
scope of our, reconnaissance. ,Site associated residues
recovered were restricted t~ lithic and ceiami~ materials.
No structural features, f~od remains or other items useful
in suggesting the nature of site usage were observed.
In a
relatively large numbei of instances, time-diagnostic artifacts
of varying ages were found at the same site -suggesting use
of the same locality at various times in the past.
The generally heavy vegetation cover characteristic of
the Cypress Creek area must be considered as a factor in
assessing the validity of the results of this reconnaissance
and as important in the design of any future archeological
surveys.
The lack of extensive ground surface exposure
must be assumed to have substantially lessened our ability
to detect evidence of prehistoric use of this landscape.
As has been discussed earlier, occasional shovel testing in
areas where some trace of cultural activity had been isolated,
or where there was some other reason to suspect its presence,
were the only avenues of response to this handicap at this
level of investigation. Also, the probabilities of active
alluviation on former land surfaces in near-stream positions
must be considered as high.
Deep overbank sediments of
Holocene age are characteristic of the modern flood plain
and undoubtedly have buried many traces of prehistoric
human activity.
Too, the presence of cutoff meander scars
and other features indicate that active channel changes
have occurred in the past and are among the natural processes
affecting the present condition of the archeological record.
Because the Corps of Engineers has not yet proposed
'specific flood control measures in the Cypress Creek baSin,
it was not possible to estimate impact on the idsutified
resources.
It is clear, however, that structural measures
involving fill removal or water retention within the 100
year flood limits and, in certain case~, the adjoining
terrace surfaces would very likely damage or destroy residual
archeological materials.
Our reconnaissance results indicate
that site density within the flood plain is higher from
stream mile 0-36, downstream from the U.S. Highway 290
crossing of Cypress Creek.
Further, co-incidence of
relatively high site density near the confluence of Cypress
Creek with its tributary drainages is evident in the same
stretch.

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

Previous discussions ~n this ~eport have emphasLzed
a presently determinable ~hieat to identified and predictable
.cul tural resources in the study area.
The current rapid
growth of commercial and residen.tial develop.ment in th.e area
east of U.S. Kighway 290 is Burely the greatest danger to
existing archeological and histo~ic sites of potential
importance.
There appears to be no governmental authority
empowered to minimize the obvious detrimental effects of
these burgeoning developments.
The nature of this investigation, i.e. a sampling

surface visibility characteristic of this area, . precl.ude.s
prudent assessment of individual site Significance.
Certainly, it is not possible to justify re~ommendations for
nomination of any defined site to the National Register of
Historic Places.
A number of identified sites appear to
have sufficient structural integrity or cultural residue
productivity to be of potential value to current arch­
eological interests or problems.
Specific recommendations
for additional, more conclusive assessment of these
localities are listed in Part I, Tables 3 and 5.
Implementation
of these suggested studies should serve to evaluate the
relative importance of these sites in a regional perspective.
In addition .to site-specific recommendations listed
therein, the following recommendations for future
archeological investigat!ons in the Cypress Creek study
area as a whole are offered:
(1)
Because the reconnaissance survey within the 100
year flood limits sampled a reasonably large percentage
(20%) of the calculated area of 80 square miles, no
additional coverage of this nature is advised. Although
it is predicted that more work at this level of investi­
gation would identify many more sites, it would not add
to, or contradict, the general results of the present
study.
Given the nature of site visibility in this
area, it is felt that the inherent limits of essentially
surface reconnaissance have been reached.
(2)
It is assumed that when flood control structural
measures are finalized by the Corps of Engineers, area
to be affected will be preced~d' by project~specific
cultural resource surveys.
To be effective, these
surveys must allow for substantial subsurface testing.

In-house
calculations made by the Texas Archeological Survey indicate
that per area unit costs for intensive survey increase by
an average factor of 2.5 to 3.0 over that for reconnaissance
survey.
The greater costs are due to the need for lengthier
periods of field and laboratory analysis f larger crews, and
the advisability of retaining geological, paleobotanical and
other specialists necessary for definitive site e~aluations.
Historic Resources
Part II of this report, "Historic Resources", contains
a summary of results, specific assessments, and recommendations
for future research (see p~. 137-140). These will be summarized
here.
In 6zder.to.identify:non-staftding_structures of historical
value, it is highly recommended that future intensive
archeological surveys be carried out concurrently with the
suggested historical research.
Sensitive areas that would
be the most productive foci for concentrated archival and
archeological research are:
(1) West of U.S. Highway 290, the Warren, Longenbach and
Josey Ranches, where remnant structures pertinent to
nineteenth-century ranching may still exist
'~2)

Little Cypress Creek where the earliest settlements of
the Germans have archeological potential
(3) The eastern portion of Cypress Creek from Hardy Road to
the junction of Spring and Cypress Creek where the house
remains of early Black freedmen require archeological and
archival analysis
/
(4)
The historic cemetaries along the entire length of Cypress
Creek lack complete documentation.

Although no identified historic properties are suggested, at the
present time, as meeting the criteria for nomination to the

176

National Register of Hiataiic Places, a number of sites
could have this potential.
These include the Hot Wells
Hotel complex, Warren Ranch Headquarters, Blackman .House,
Windwood Presbyterian GhurchandBurnett' s "Settlement.
