Hays County, Texas

Abstract
Due to the potential impacts of the proposed La Cima Project in Hays County, Texas
(i.e., archaeological sites and historic-age structures), Bowman Consulting contracted
HDR Engineering to perform an intensive cultural resources survey of the project area.
The purpose of this cultural resources survey is to provide an inventory of cultural
resources within the proposed area of potential effects (APE). Any cultural resources
identified were evaluated for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).
The field survey consisted of five days of intensive survey in October of 2014. Intensive
survey techniques included pedestrian survey, shovel testing of potential sites, and
documentation of standing structures. A total of 290 person-hours were invested in the
field project.
Fourteen archaeological sites were recorded during the survey of the project area, and
none are recommended eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Forty-two non-site isolated
finds were encountered and recorded during the course of the survey. Isolated finds do
not meet the requirements for site designation and cannot be considered for NRHP
eligibility. In addition, the location of one previously recorded site (41HY153) was
revisited, but no evidence of the site was identified. As a result of the field survey, two
historic-age sites with components built more than 50 years ago were documented. One
site—Architecture 1—includes a corral and an animal watering system with building
materials dating to the late-nineteenth or early-twentieth century. The other site—
Architecture 2—includes a barn with an associated corral/pen system and watering
facilities. These structures were likely built in the 1940s after local rancher J.H. Robinson
and his wife Velma purchased the parcel in 1941. Neither architectural site is
recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP. Thus, it is recommended that the
construction of the proposed La Cima development project is not likely to affect
significant cultural resources within the APE.

Introduction
As part of the La Cima Project, Bowman Consulting has proposed the construction of the
proposed La Cima development project in Hays County, Texas, with an area of potential
effects (APE) of approximately 1,247 acres (505 hectares) (Figure 1-1).
Due to the potential impacts of the proposed La Cima Project (i.e., archaeological sites
and structures 50 years old or older), Bowman Consulting contracted HDR Engineering
to perform an intensive cultural resources survey of the project area. The purpose of this
cultural resources survey is to provide an inventory of cultural resources within the
proposed APE. Any cultural resources identified were evaluated for their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The intensive survey, including pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and documentation of
structures 50 years old or older within the APE, was completed between the 27th and 31st
of October 2014. The project area for the proposed development is located west of the
city of San Marcos, and south of Ranch Road 12 (RR12), in Hays County, Texas. A total
of 290 person-hours were invested in the field project.
Megan Koszarek and Johan Rodriguez were the project archaeologists, and crew
members included Steven Cummins, Cesario Guerra, Jessica Mauck, Ben Morton, and
Steven Sykes. Clayton Tinsley served as the Principal Investigator. The historical
research and architectural evaluations were conducted by architectural historian Ann
Keen.
All records and materials generated by this project will be permanently curated at the
Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.

Environmental Setting

2.1

Topography and Hydrology
The project area is located within Hays County and is part of the Balcones Canyonlands
Level IV ecoregion within the Edwards Plateau Level III ecoregion with elevations
ranging from 650 to 2,400 feet above sea level. The Edwards Aquifer lies beneath the
ecoregion, which is resupplied through percolation through the porous limestone (Griffith
et al. 2004, 2007). Numerous waterways dissect this region and high gradient streams
flow from springs in the canyons. Purgatory Creek bisects the project area and is one of
many perennial streams that cut across this ecoregion.

2.2

Geology and Soils
According to the Bureau of Economic Geology (1982), the underlying geology of the
region is comprised of Edwards Limestone, undivided of Lower Cretaceous Age, with a
thickness of approximately 350–400 feet. The primary rock is limestone, but dolomite
and chert are also present in the region.
According to data from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the project
area is comprised of three soil map units (Web Soil Survey 2014). These units are the
Rumple-Comfort association 1 to 8 percent slopes (RUD), Comfort-Rock outcrop
complex 1 to 8 percent slopes (CrD), and the Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex 8 to 30
percent slopes (ErG). The soil series descriptions that follow are based on the soil survey
of Comal and Hays Counties in Texas (United States Department of Agriculture 1984).
The Rumple-Comfort association dominates the area, covering 57.2% of the APE. The
Rumple soil series has slopes ranging from 1 to 8 percent and consists of cherty and
clayey soils with a four horizons profile: A1) very cherty clay loam from 0–10 inches,
color is dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3), and 35% by volume of angular chert fragments;
B21t) very cherty clay from 10–14 inches, color is dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4), and
35% by volume of angular chert fragments; B22t) extremely stony clay from 14–28
inches, color is dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4), and 75% by volume of limestone
cobbles and stones and chert pebbles and cobbles; R) coarsely fractured indurated
limestone from 28–36 inches with dark reddish brown clay in crevices. The Comfort soil
series is described below.
The second most prominent soil unit on the project area is the Comfort-Rock outcrop
complex, which encompasses 41.6% of the total APE, with slopes ranging from 1 to 8
percent. In general, the Comfort soil series is extremely stony clay formed from
weathered dolomitic limestone. Typically, the soil profile consists of three horizons: A1)
extremely stony clay from 0–6 inches, color is dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), and 45% of
cobbles and stones by volume; B2t) extremely stony clay from 6–13 inches, color is dark
reddish brown (5YR 3/2), and 70% of stones by volume; R) from 13–20 inches with
indurated dolomitic limestone.
The Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex is the third soil unit and is present only on 1.2% of
the APE. The Eckrant series consists of very shallow clayey soils on uplands (1 to 30
percent slopes), formed over indurated fractured limestone. Three horizons are present

Hays County, Texas

in the soil profile: A11) extremely stony clay from 0–6 inches, color is very dark gray
(10YR 3/1), and 35% limestone fragments by volume; A12) extremely stony clay from 6–
10 inches, color is very dark gray (10YR 3/1), and 75% limestone fragments by volume;
R) indurated, fractured limestone from 10–20 inches.

2.3

Climate
The project area is located within the Humid Subtropical climate subtype (Cfa), defined
by the Köeppen Climate Classification and characterized by hot humid summers and
mild to cool winters (Kottek et al. 2006). The mean annual precipitation is 26–34 inches,
with temperatures ranging from 34°F in the winter to 94°F in the summer.

2.4

Flora and Fauna
According to Griffith et al. (2004) the project area is located within Hays County and is
part of the Balcones Canyonlands Level IV ecoregion within the Edwards Plateau Level
III ecoregion. This ecoregion supports deciduous woodlands. Common flora in the region
is escarpment black cherry, Texas mountain laurel, madrone, Lacey oak, bigtooth maple,
and Carolina basswood. The region also supports bald cyprus, American sycamore, and
black willow along its major waterways in the east. In the west, vegetation consists of live
oak woodland; and the north consists of open shrublands with juniper, sumac, sotol,
acacia, honey mesquite, and ceniza. The region is used for grazing livestock including
cattle, sheep, and goats. Exotic game mammals and wildlife are also found in the region
(Griffith et al. 2004).

Cultural History

3.1

Prehistoric (ca. 10,000 B.C.–A.D.1540)
Several current regional chronologies (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode
1994) are utilized in the following discussion of Central Texas prehistory. The regional
chronology is divided into three basic periods: Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric (Table 2-1).

Paleo-Indian (10,000–6800 B.C.)
Human occupation in Central Texas is generally agreed to have begun during the
terminal Pleistocene. This initial Paleo-Indian cultural period is dated to approximately
10,000–6800 B.C. (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994). In Central
Texas, the Paleo-Indian period is divided into Early (10,000–8900 B.C.) and Late (8900–
6800 B.C.) subperiods. The Early Paleo-Indian period is characterized by fluted Clovis
projectile points along with prismatic blade manufacture. Subsistence during this
subperiod appears to have been diverse and consisted of both megafauna
(e.g., mammoth and extinct large bison) as well as smaller taxa such as badger, alligator,
and moles (Collins et al. 1989). Prominent sites in the region with Early Paleo-Indian
components include the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault sites. The Late
Paleo-Indian continues with a mixed hunting-gathering tradition and is characterized by
the Folsom and Plainview point types (Collins 1998). Burned rock features made their
first appearance in Central Texas during the Late Paleo-Indian period (Masson and
Collins 1995). Sites of note in the region with Late Paleo-Indian components include
Wilson-Leonard, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall.

3.1.2

Archaic (6800 B.C.–A.D. 750)
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) formulation of the Central Texas Archaic makes use of
three subdivisions: Early Archaic (6800–4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000–2000 B.C.),
and Late Archaic (2000 B.C.–A.D. 750) based on point typologies.

Early Archaic (6800–4000 B.C.)
The Early Archaic in Central Texas is most known for its large burned rock midden sites
that commonly constitute multiple tons of fire-cracked rock. Although burned rock

middens are first noted in the Late Paleo-Indian period for Central Texas, they became a
prominent site type by the Early Archaic. The Early Archaic is generally defined by three
projectile point style intervals: Angostura, Early Split-stem, and Martindale-Uvalde
(Johnson and Goode 1994). In addition to burned rock middens, site types include open
campsites (Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, and Richard-Beene) and caves (Hall’s Cave).
Subsistence evidence for the Early Archaic is varied, with deer, small animal, fish, and
plant bulb being common taxa. Pollen and fluvial geological evidence suggest that
environmental conditions during the period fluctuated between mesic and xeric (Collins
2004).

Middle Archaic (4000–2000 B.C.)
Bell/Andice/Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan/Travis constitute the three projectile point
styles indicative of the Middle Archaic period (Johnson and Goode 1994). The
Bell/Andice/Calf Creek point technology along with environmental data suggesting mesic
conditions are seen by Collins (1995) as evidence for a focus on bison hunting. However,
by the latter portion of the Middle Archaic, environmental conditions appear to have
shifted again to being more xeric. The xeric conditions of the Middle Archaic have been
correlated with an increase in burned rock midden deposits, and this association is
believed to have been due to a greater reliance upon tuberous plants such as stool iris
(Johnson and Goode 1994).

Late Archaic (2000 B.C.–A.D. 750)
According to Johnson and Goode (1994), the Late Archaic for Central Texas can be
subdivided into (ascending chronological order) six style intervals: Bulverde,
Pedernales/Kinney,
Lange/Marshall/Williams,
Marcos/Montell/Castroville,
Ensor/Frio/Fairland, and Darl. The Late Archaic in Central Texas began with xeric
conditions and progressively became more mesic. Burned rock midden deposits
continue to be a significant part of many site assemblages and actually peak in density
during the Pedernales/Kinney interval (Collins 2004). Dart points, corner-tanged knives,
and cylindrical stone pipes are associated with Late Archaic site assemblages from
Central Texas. A mixed hunting-gathering economy of large and small animals as well as
various reliable plants of the region (e.g., stool iris and pecan) became well developed by
the end of the Late Archaic and continued largely unchanged into the early Late
Prehistoric.

3.1.3

Late Prehistoric (A.D. 750–1540)
The Late Prehistoric period of the region is divided into Early (Austin interval) and Late
(Toyah interval) subperiods (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994). The evolution to
the Late Prehistoric period in Central Texas is signaled by the introduction of bow and
arrow technology that occurs during the Austin interval. Although the arrow point made
its debut in the Late Prehistoric, it is initially under-represented when compared to dart
points. The later Toyah interval of the Late Prehistoric is characterized by the dominance
of the arrow point, specifically the Perdiz type. The constellation of Perdiz arrow points,
locally manufactured ceramics, end scrapers, and prismatic blades is seen as an
indication of a focus on large game animals (e.g., bison, deer, and antelope).
Researchers currently disagree on whether this artifact assemblage represents a technocomplex (Ricklis 1994) or an actual cultural group (Johnson and Goode 1994).

3.2

Historic Period (A.D. 1540–1970)
The Historic period began with the arrival of the first Europeans in the area: Coronado’s
1540–1542 expedition to the Plains of Cibola (Castañeda 1554[1904]). Coronado’s
chroniclers and those of later Spanish expeditions report that the region was occupied by
Apacha (Apache) people. Based on Spanish descriptions of the Apache lifeways—with
limited sedentism and a seasonal round of bison hunting and foraging—it seems that the
Garza and Toyah archaeological complexes may represent early Apache occupations
(Boyd 1997). In an alternative interpretation that has not yet gained traction in the Texas
archaeological community, Garza and other Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric
assemblages have also been linked to the Wichita (Baugh and Perkins 2008; Roberts
and Bradford 1997).
If Garza and/or Toyah indeed represent early Apache occupations, the Apache were the
primary native group in the area until the early to mid-eighteenth century, when nomadic
Comanche hunters arrived from the Great Basin and plains northwest of Texas
(Lipscomb 2008). Various Anglo, French, and Spanish traders maintained commercial
relationships with the Apache and Comanche, but locations and timing of these
interactions are debated; for instance, sites of the Spanish traders known as
comancheros have not been securely identified because “no one is sure what they
should look like” (Freeman and Boyd 1997:82). Shoshonean-speaking Comanche
continued their presence in Central Texas until the end of the nineteenth century.
Euro-American exploration of Hays County occurred during the Spanish period of Texas,
with early expeditions crossing the region in 1691, 1709, and 1714. The first attempt at
settlement came in 1807 along the San Marcos River but was abandoned after four
years (Cecil and Greene 2010). The newly independent Mexican government issued
land grants for the county in the 1830s, with the first Anglo-American settler establishing
a farm north of present-day San Marcos in 1846 (Cecil and Greene 2010).
In 1848, the Texas legislature established Hays County out of a portion of Travis County
and named San Marcos as the county seat. The county was named for John Coffee
Hays, who led a company of Texas Rangers. Official establishment of the county
encouraged settlement, and the population grew from 387 in 1850 to 2,126 in 1860
(Historical Census Browser 2004). Settlers originated from throughout Texas, Georgia,
and Arkansas; and the county supported the Confederate States during the Civil War.
Mid-nineteenth century development in the county included a stage line, cotton gins, a
number of mills, and a beef-packing enterprise. Cattle ranching and farming were the
primary economic forces drawing more settlers to the county, and when the first rail line
came through in 1880, the population almost doubled by 1900—from 7,555 to 14,142
(Cecil and Greene 2010). The population remained steady until the 1960s. Farming and
ranching remained the most important economic factors to county residents through the
mid-1960s, until the establishment of the Gary Job Corps Training Center in 1964 and
the rapid enrollment increase at Texas State University in San Marcos during that same
timeframe. The county’s population boomed from 19,934 in 1960 to 27,642 in 1970
(Cecil and Greene 2010). The county’s continued development during the last quarter of
the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century is largely due to its proximity to the
city of Austin and the ongoing commercial expansion along Interstate 35.

Methodology

4.1

Previous Investigations in the Vicinity of the Project
Area
Recorded cultural resources were evaluated for the one-mile radius of the 1,247-acre
(505-hectare) project area (Figure 4-1). A review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission, revealed 23 recorded archaeological
sites within a one-mile radius of the project area and one site (41HY153) within the APE
(Table 4-1). Ten previous cultural resources surveys were conducted within a one-mile
radius of the project area (Table 4-2). Additionally, one Historic Marker (#10285) is
located within a one-mile radius of the project area. This marker, erected in 1982,
commemorates the Lloyd Gideon Johnson House located at 1030 Belvin Street, San
Marcos, Texas. The Mediterranean-style house was built in 1919–1920 by Atlee B. Ayres
and served as a private residence until purchased by the San Marcos Masonic Lodge in
1937. The house returned to a private residence in 1990. The Lloyd Gideon Johnson
House is a recorded Texas Historical Landmark. No National Register Eligible
Properties/Districts or cemeteries were located within a one-mile radius of the project
area.

Field Methods
As part of the cultural resources survey of the project area, an intensive archaeological
survey implementing pedestrian survey and shovel testing was conducted. An evaluation
of standing structures was also included in the cultural resources survey.

4.2.1

Archaeological Survey
During the five days of field survey, one seven-person crew conducted a pedestrian
survey in the APE in accordance with THC standards. This method was chosen due to
the lack of soil deposition and high surface visibility (>30 percent) in the project area. The
field conditions were verified with the average ground visibility being between 50 to 80
percent. The whole project area consists of 1,247 acres (505 hectares), but only those
areas with a slope less than 15% were systematically pedestrian surveyed, for a total of
689 acres (279 hectares). The archaeology crew was equipped with two Trimble XT
Global Positioning System (GPS) units for recording the location of transects, surface
material, and standing structures. The pedestrian survey involved systematically
traversing the project area at uniform transect intervals of 15 m. Surface collections of
both historic and prehistoric materials involved only temporally diagnostic artifacts or
tools that could offer information concerning historic or prehistoric periods in which site
activities may have occurred as well as lithic material samples.
Each site was identified by a temporary marker placed on site. The marker had an
identifying number in the form of “LC HDR ###”. This number was a temporary field
number only. Site designations were applied only to clusters of artifacts that represented
occupation or activity areas. Field notes concerning sites were maintained by the project
archaeologist. The field notes documented survey conditions, vegetation cover, and
initial interpretations of the cultural properties.
All records and materials generated by this project will be permanently curated at the
Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.

4.2.2

Site Designation
The THC differentiates between archaeological sites and isolated finds. Sites are
evaluated and recommended eligible or ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Isolated
finds are ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP as they do not meet the requirements to be
designated as a site. The HDR standards applied to this project in defining
archaeological sites and isolated finds involve the cultural affiliation and number of
artifacts present within an area of pre-determined size. A prehistoric site designation is
applied when five or more prehistoric artifacts are present within a 20 m² area. A historic
site designation is applied when 10 or more artifacts of two or more artifacts classes are
present within a 20 m² area. All sites were sketch-mapped and photographed. Isolated
finds are defined as the presence of four artifacts or less within a 20 m² area. A State of
Texas Archeological Site Form was completed, as required by the THC, for all sites and
encountered during the current project. These forms record a variety of data including
location, setting, artifactual materials recovered, and other information.

4.3

Lithic Analysis
Lithic artifacts included chipped stone debitage, tools, and tested cobbles. The major
prehistoric artifact class identified was lithic debitage. Chipped stone tools and debitage
were sorted into classes. Variables recorded for the lithic debitage included amount of
dorsal cortex (if present), heat-treatment or burning, and material type. Chipped stone
tools were identified on the basis of morphology, manufacturing method, and use-wear.
The identification of utilized and edge-modified flake tools was undertaken with caution

March 2015 | 15

Phase I Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed La Cima Development Project,
Hays County, Texas

due to the variety of other damaging processes such as trampling and spontaneous
retouch during flake detachment. Raw material identification was based on macroscopic
characteristics such as color, texture, inclusions, cortex, and hardness.

4.4

Architectural Resources
Archival research was conducted in order to determine historic land use patterns
associated with the project area and thus establish what types of standing structures
were likely to be encountered during the survey. Using the THC standard of 50 years or
older, the focus was on resources built prior to 1964. Research was conducted using
holdings from a number of repositories including the Texas/Dallas History and Archives
Division of the Dallas Public Library, the Hays County Central Appraisal District, and the
Texas Land Records Real Property database. Research efforts focused on sources such
as county histories, historic maps, and local newspapers. Information gathered during
this phase was analyzed and synthesized to prepare a historic context for the project
area as well as a parcel history for the architectural site documented.
For this study, Secretary of the Interior-qualified architectural historian Ann Keen
examined available county and topographic maps, county histories, and other data
pertinent to the project area. This task commenced with an investigation of Texas THC
resources and the National Register Information System (NRIS) website. THC
information and NRIS revealed that no previously identified architectural resources were
located within the proposed project study area. No National Historic Landmarks (NHLs),
NRHP, or State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) properties related to architecture were
identified in the project area.
As a result of the field survey, two architectural resources were identified within the APE
(Architecture 1 and Architecture 2) and were keyed onto the survey results aerial map
(Figure 5-1). The resources were evaluated to determine NRHP eligibility, based on
archival research, as well as the architectural significance and integrity of the standing
structures. The descriptions, visual documentation, and evaluations are presented in the
Results chapter (Chapter 5).

Survey Results
The fieldwork conducted within the APE encountered vegetation characterized by thick
mottes of cedar/juniper, oaks, and open grassland with patchy cacti and rock outcrops.
The project area encompasses a hilly terrain with slopes varying along Purgatory Creek’s
drainage system and is currently being used mainly for cattle grazing and seasonal
hunting activities. Since ground visibility was variable due to the vegetation, the APE was
surveyed according to THC survey standards for project areas that have greater than
30% surface visibility. A pedestrian survey was employed in areas with a slope less than
15%; and where intact soils were present, judgmental shovel testing was employed.
A total of 14 archaeological sites (41HY503 through 41HY516) and 42 isolated finds (LC
ISO 001 through LC ISO 042) were identified and recorded within the project area. Two
architectural sites 50 years old or older were identified and evaluated. All the cultural
resources identified in the APE are recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP,
and no further work is recommended (Table 5-1).

Archaeological Survey Results
A total of 14 archaeological sites (41HY503 through 41HY516) were identified, and an
attempt was made to relocate one previously recorded site (41HY153) within the APE
(Figure 5-1). According to the type and proportion of lithic materials, ten of the newly
recorded sites were classified as lithic scatters and four as procurement areas.
Additionally, 39 prehistoric, and three historic non-site isolates were located during the
course of the survey. Following discussion of the previously recorded site revisit, the
newly discovered archaeological sites are discussed below following the order in which
they were registered, covering the project area from the southwest to the northeast.

5.1.1

Site 41HY153
Site 41HY153 is a previously recorded archaeological site located in the northwestern
corner of the project area (Figure 5-1), approximately 100 m (300 ft) south of RR 12. It
was originally recorded in 1981 by the Texas Archaeological Society (TAS) and was
revisited in 2002, 2003, and 2012. The site was recorded as a superficial lithic
procurement/primary reduction site with dimensions of 400 x 75 m (3000 m² [1,312 x 246
ft; 322,752 ft²]). The site was originally described in 1981 as an area of low to moderate
density quarry debris on a rocky hill slope, and disturbed by road and substation
construction. Later, in 2002, the south side of the site was reported as virtually
obliterated with little evidence left, and it was determined that research potential is low
due to lack of soil deposition and diagnostic artifacts. No further investigation was
warranted. The site has been determined to be not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
During the La Cima project, the location of site 41HY153 was revisited, but no cultural
evidence could be detected during the pedestrian survey performed of the area. Possible
causes of the destruction of site 41HY153 are related to active erosion and construction
projects.

5.1.2

Site 41HY503
Site 41HY503 is a prehistoric surface lithic scatter located west of a two-track road
intersection leading to the Storey-Robinson Dam on Purgatory Creek (Figure 5-2; Figure
5-3). The site encompasses 35 x 63 m, totaling 2,205 m² (114 x 206 ft; 23,484 ft²).
The lithic material observed on the surface was local in origin and consisted of 18
artifacts. The assemblage consisted of 16 chipped stone debitage (six primary flakes,
nine secondary flakes, and one tertiary flake), one core, and one tested cobble (Tables
5-2 and 5-3).
A total of six shovel tests were placed in areas with soil deposition, each reaching the
bedrock at a depth of 30 cm (12 inbs) from the surface. The soil has a dark brown color
(7.5YR 3/3), and a clay loam texture with the presence of gravel and cobbles (Figure 54). All shovel tests were devoid of cultural artifacts.
The site appears to have no research potential based on the low artifact density and lack
of diagnostic artifacts or cultural features. Furthermore, the site does not appear to
exhibit contextual integrity due to its deflated upland setting and is unlikely to add to our
understanding of prehistory in the region. No further work is recommended at site
41HY503.

Site 41HY504
Site 41HY504 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located north of a two-track road leading to the
Storey-Robinson Dam on Purgatory Creek (Figure 5-5; Figure 5-6). The site dimensions
are approximately 66 x 62 m (4,092 m2 [217 x 203 ft; 44,051 ft2]).
A total of 108 lithic artifacts were identified on the surface in deflated areas on exposed
limestone bedrock and within buried contexts at site 41HY504 (Tables 5-4 and 5-5). The
surface lithic material consisted of 90 chipped stone debitage (two primary flakes, 42
secondary flakes, and 46 tertiary flakes), four unifaces, three biface fragments, four
projectile points, one core, and one tested cobble. The projectile points recovered from
deflated surface contexts include one Early Triangular point (Early Archaic, ca. 3700
B.C.–3600 B.C.) (Figure 5-7), two Kent points (Middle to Transitional Archaic, ca. 2000
B.C.–A.D. 500) (Figure 5-8; Figure 5-9), and one Ensor point (Transitional Archaic, ca.
200 B.C.–A.D. 600) (Figure 5-10). Both typology and chronology for these points were
estimated following the classification proposed by Turner and Hester (1991). The
occurrence of artifacts representing several periods within the Archaic at this site
suggests a repeated use of the same space over a long time frame.
Of the six shovel tests excavated in areas with soil deposition, three were positive for
subsurface cultural materials at depths ranging from 10 to 25 cmbs (4 to 10 inbs). The
material observed in these shovel tests consisted of five pieces of debitage (one
secondary flake and four tertiary flakes). The soil has a black color (10YR 2/1) and a clay
loam texture with the presence of gravel and cobbles (Figure 5-11). Shovel tests were
terminated at depths ranging between 15 and 30 cmbs (6 and 12 inbs) due to contact
with bedrock. No diagnostic materials or evidence of cultural features were found within
the subsurface.
The minimal soil deposition and absence of Archaic Period artifacts or other diagnostic
materials within the subsurface suggests that the subsurface artifacts are likely unrelated
to the surface Archaic diagnostics. In addition, the deflated upland setting in combination
with the lack of cultural features suggests that site 41HY504 retains little original integrity
and has low potential for any additional knowledge of prehistory of the region. No further
work is recommended at 41HY504.

Site 41HY505
41HY505 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located southwest of a two-track road leading to
the Storey-Robinson Dam on Purgatory Creek (Figure 5-12; Figure 5-13), encompassing
29 x 43 m with a total of 1,247 m² (95 x 141 ft; 13,395 ft²).
In total, 36 lithic artifacts were observed on the surface. The assemblage consists of 30
chipped stone debitage (two primary flakes, 18 secondary flakes, and 10 tertiary flakes),
one uniface, three bifaces, one informal tool in the form of a modified flake, and one
projectile point basal fragment (Tables 5-6 and 5-7). The point resembles those
described by Turner and Hester (1991) as Plainview points, which corresponds with the
Paleo-Indian Period (ca. 8150 B.C.–8010 B.C.) (Figure 5-14). No shovel tests were
excavated due to the lack of soil deposition.
Due to the deflated upland setting, low density of artifacts, lack of soil deposition, and
absence of cultural features, the site lacks the potential to significantly aid in our
understanding of the prehistory in the region. No further work is recommended at
41HY505.

Site 41HY506
Site 41HY506 is a prehistoric lithic scatter at the southeastern portion of the project area,
located on a limestone outcrop in an upland setting 0.35 mile north of Purgatory Creek
(Figure 5-15; Figure 5-16). The site measures 13 x 16 m (208 m² [42 x 52 ft; 2,184 ft²]).
The scatter consists of a total of 31 artifacts, including 28 chipped stone debitage (13
secondary flakes and 15 tertiary flakes), one projectile point tip fragment, one biface, and
one core (Tables 5-8 and 5-9). All artifacts were composed of local material. Due to the
lack of soil deposition, no shovel tests were excavated.
Based on the low density of artifacts, deflated upland setting, and lack of diagnostic
artifacts or cultural features, site 41HY506 does not appear to retain integrity or exhibit
potential to aid in further understanding the prehistory of the region; thus, no further work
is recommended.

Site 41HY507
41HY507 is a low-density lithic procurement site located on a limestone outcrop within
dense vegetation northwest of a two-track road, bisected by a barbed wire fence, and
bounded on the north by an intermittent stream (Figure 5-17; Figure 5-18). The site
encompasses 16 x 15 m, totaling 240 m² (52 x 49 ft; 2,548 ft²).
The findings at 41HY507 consisted of a total of 22 artifacts observed on the surface
during the pedestrian survey, including 14 large chipped stone debitage (two primary
flakes, 11 secondary flakes, and one tertiary flake), four tested cobbles, and four bifaces
(Tables 5-10 and 5-11). No shovel tests were excavated due to the lack of soil
deposition. The amount of large sized debitage, tested cobbles, and cores on a rocky
outcrop suggests that this site was likely used for lithic procurement activities.
Site 41HY507 does not have potential to aid in our understanding of the prehistory of this
region due to the low density of artifacts, lack of diagnostic materials or cultural features,
and continual water erosion down slope. In consequence, the original integrity of the site
has been compromised, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41HY508
41HY508 is a lithic procurement site located south of a two-track road and northeast of a
corral structure identified in this report as Architecture 2 (see Section 5.3.2.) (Figure 519; Figure 5-20), encompassing 28 x 40 m with a total of 1,120 m² (91 x 131 ft; 11,921
ft²).
During pedestrian survey and subsurface testing at 41HY508, a total of 42 artifacts were
recovered (Tables 5-12 and 5-13). Twenty-six of these artifacts were observed on the
surface, including eight chipped stone debitage (five primary flakes and three secondary
flakes), nine cores, eight tested cobbles, and one biface fragment, which was collected
as a source material sample. The amount of tested cobbles and cores suggests that
41HY508 was likely used for lithic procurement.
All six shovel tests excavated at 41HY508 yielded subsurface cultural materials. The
shovel tests distribution was placed according to the soil deposition at the site. These
materials consisted of 16 chipped stone debitage (seven cultural shatter, one primary
flake, four secondary flakes, and four tertiary flakes) at depths ranging from the surface
to 30 cmbs (12 inbs). The soil has a dark brown color (7.5YR 3/3) and a clay loam
texture with the presence of gravel and cobbles (Figure 5-21).
The low density of artifacts, lack of diagnostics, and absence of cultural features
suggests a limited potential to further knowledge in regards to the prehistory of the
region. In addition, the deflated upland setting and livestock activity have affected the
contextual integrity of the site. For all these reasons, no further work is recommended.

Site 41HY509
41HY509 is a prehistoric lithic procurement site located in the northwestern portion of the
project area, between a two-track road and the southern limit of the San Marcos Baptist
Academy (Figure 5-22; Figure 5-23). The site’s measurements are 19 x 28 m (532 m² [62
x 91 ft; 5,642 ft²]).
Found during pedestrian survey on a hilltop, the site yielded a total of 28 artifacts in both
surface and subsurface contexts (Tables 5-14 and 5-15). The surface scatter consisted
of 18 prehistoric artifacts including: 10 tested cobbles, one core, and seven chipped
stone debitage (one primary flake and six secondary flakes).
The site contents are primarily superficial, but four out of six shovel tests placed on areas
with soil deposition revealed artifacts to a depth ranging from the surface to 20 cmbs (8
inbs) (Figure 5-24). The subsurface material consisted of seven cultural shatter, two
secondary flakes, and one tertiary flake. The soil is characterized by a dark brown color
(7.5YR 3/3) and a clay loam texture with the presence of gravel and cobbles (Figure 524).
The low density of artifacts and lack of diagnostic materials or cultural features provide
little future research potential, and it is not likely that 41HY509 could significantly add to
our understanding of the prehistory or history of the region. Furthermore, the site’s
integrity is affected by environmental factors such as erosion. No future work is
recommended.

Site 41HY510
41HY510 is a low density prehistoric lithic scatter bisected by a two-track road located in
the northwestern portion of the project area (Figure 5-25; Figure 5-26). The site
encompasses 49 x 39 m, totaling 1,911 m² (160 x 127 ft; 20,320 ft²).
A total of 31 artifacts were identified at the site during pedestrian survey and shovel
testing (Tables 5-16 and 5-17). Among those detected on the surface are: one core, one
tested cobble, and 20 chipped stone debitage (two primary flakes, 12 secondary flakes,
and six tertiary flakes).
After placing six shovel tests on areas with soil deposition within the site, all of them were
positive for cultural deposits to a depth of 20 cmbs (8 inbs). A total of one core, one
cultural shatter, three secondary flakes, and four tertiary flakes were observed within a
dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) soil with a clay loam texture. Encounter with bedrock in shovel
tests ranged between 10 and 30 cmbs (4 and 12 inbs) (Figure 5-27).
Given the low density of artifacts and lack of diagnostic materials or cultural features, the
evidence suggests a limited potential to gain further knowledge in regards to the
prehistory of the region. Additionally, the site does not appear to retain integrity due to
the road’s proximity. No further work is recommended.

Site 41HY511
Site 41HY511 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located in the northern end of the project area,
between Ranch Road 12 and an electric substation to the west (Figure 5-28; Figure 529). The site, encompassing 148 x 97 m, totaling 14,356 m² (485 x 318 ft; 154,230 ft²), is
located on a hilltop bisected by a two-track road. The location also serves as a hunting
spot and includes two deer feeders.
The site yielded 100 artifacts in total, including one tested cobble, two cores, seven
bifaces, four informal tools in the form of modified flakes, and 86 chipped stone debitage
(two primary flakes, 26 secondary flakes, and 58 tertiary flakes) (Tables 5-18 and 5-19).
The quantity of artifacts such as bifaces and informal tools associated with a relatively
large amount of stone debitage, especially secondary and tertiary flakes, could suggest
that 41HY511 was likely used for tool manufacture or retouch.
The subsurface shovel tests within site 41HY511 were culturally sterile. All six shovel
tests were placed on areas with soil deposition, reaching the bedrock at a depth of 30 cm
(12 inbs) from the surface. The soil has a dark brown color (10YR 3/3) and a clay loam
texture with the presence of gravel and cobbles (Figure 5-30).
Due to natural erosion, moderate vehicular traffic, and hunting activities, the original
integrity of site 41HY511 has been compromised. Moreover, the lack of diagnostic
artifacts or cultural features limits the potential to gain further knowledge in regards to the
prehistory of the region. No further work is recommended.

5.1.11

Site 41HY512
41HY512 is a dense lithic procurement site on top of a limestone outcrop. It is located
south of Ranch Road 12 (Wonder World Dr.), between the property’s fence and a twotrack road (Figure 5-31; Figure 5-32; Figure 5-33). The site’s measurements are 33 x 48
m (1,584 m² [108 x 157 ft; 16,956 ft²]).
The site yielded 229 artifacts in total, including 10 bifaces, three tested cobbles, six
cores, two informal tools or modified flakes, and 208 chipped stone debitage (19 primary
flakes, 156 secondary flakes, and 33 tertiary flakes) (Tables 5-20 and 5-21). The amount
of stone debitage associated with cores and bifaces on a rocky outcrop suggests that
this site was likely used for lithic procurement activities. Due to the lack of soil deposition,
no shovel tests were excavated.
Based on the site’s deflated upland setting, lack of diagnostic materials or cultural
features, 41HY512 exhibits low potential to gain any further knowledge relating to the
prehistory of the region. As a result, no further work is recommended.

Site 41HY513
Site 41HY513 is a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter with no diagnostic artifacts, located
100 feet west of a two-track road in the northeastern portion of the project area (Figure 534; Figure 5-35). The site measurements are 20 x 19 m (380 m² [65 x 62 ft; 4,030 ft²]).
A total of 15 artifacts were recovered during pedestrian survey and shovel testing
(Tables 5-22 and 5-23). The surface scatter included three cores, two informal tools in
the form of modified flakes, and six chipped stone debitage (one primary flake, two
secondary flakes, and three tertiary flakes).
Of the six shovel tests excavated, four yielded subsurface cultural materials at depths
ranging from the surface to 20 cmbs (8 inbs). The material observed in these shovel
tests consisted of one primary flake, two secondary flakes, and one tertiary flake. The
soil has a dark brown color (7.5YR 3/3) and a clay loam texture with the presence of
gravel and cobbles (Figure 5-36).
Due to the low density of artifacts and lack of diagnostic materials or cultural features,
site 41HY513 is considered to have low potential to further our understanding of the
regional prehistory. Also, its proximity to one of the property’s access roads and its
location along a secondary road indicates that the integrity of the site has been
compromised. No further work is recommended.

Site 41HY514
Site 41HY514 is a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter located on a hilltop between two, twotrack roads in the eastern portion of the project area (Figure 5-37, Figure 5-38). The site
measurements are 11 x 17 m (187 m² [36 x 55 ft; 1,980 ft²]).
In total, 18 artifacts were detected after surface and subsurface inspections (Tables 5-24
and 5-25). Among the findings at this site, there were seven artifacts observed on the
surface during the pedestrian survey. The surface material consisted of three cores, one
informal tool in the form of a modified flake, and three chipped stone debitage (one
primary flake, one secondary flake, and one tertiary flake).
All six shovel tests excavated on areas with soil deposition within the site were positive
except for one. The subsurface material observed between the surface and 20 cmbs (8
inbs) included one primary flake, seven secondary flakes, and three tertiary flakes. The
soil is characterized by a dark brown color (7.5YR 3/3) and a clay loam texture with the
presence of gravel and cobbles (Figure 5-39).
41HY514 does not have potential to aid in our understanding of the prehistory of this
area due to the low density of cultural materials and lack of diagnostic artifacts or cultural
features. No further work is recommended.

Site 41HY515
41HY515 consists of a low density lithic scatter on a limestone outcrop. The site is
located on a side slope east of an intermittent stream in the northeastern portion of the
project area (Figure 5-40; Figure 5-41). The site encompasses 10 x 6 m, totaling 60 m²
(32 x 19 ft; 608 ft²).
Among the local findings, a total of 15 artifacts were observed on a side slope eroding
towards the stream. The material consists of one biface and 14 chipped stone debitage
(three primary flakes, 10 secondary flakes, and one tertiary flake) (Tables 5-26 and
5-27). Due to the lack of soil deposition, no shovel tests were excavated.
Based on the site’s location on an eroding side slope and lack of diagnostic materials or
cultural features, site 41HY515 exhibits low potential to gain any further knowledge
relating to the prehistory of the region. No further work is recommended.

Site 41HY516
41HY516 is a diffuse lithic scatter site on a hilltop located 150 feet south of a two-track
road that runs SW-NE through the property, and approximately 0.5 mile down this road
from the property entrance at Ranch Road 12 (Figure 5-42; Figure 5-43). The site
encompasses 22 x 11 m, totaling 242 m² (72 x 36 ft; 2,592 ft²).
A total of 19 artifacts were observed on the site: one tested cobble, two bifaces, one
informal tool in the form of a modified flake, and 15 chipped stone debitage (11
secondary flakes and four tertiary flakes) (Tables 5-28 and 5-29). No shovel tests were
excavated due to the lack of soil deposition.
Due to the low density nature of the site, lack of soil deposition, and lack of diagnostic
artifacts or cultural features, site 41HY516 is considered to have low potential to yield
further research to aid in our understanding of the regional prehistory. No further work is
recommended.

Isolated Finds Descriptions
Upon completion of the archaeological survey within the La Cima APE, 39 prehistoric
and three historic non-site isolates had been recorded (Table 5-30). Isolate designations
were ascribed to an artifact or artifact cluster that did not meet the definition of an
archaeological site.
A total of 42 isolated finds were identified during the survey (see Table 5-30). Of these
isolated finds, 39 were prehistoric (LC ISO 001–LC ISO 016, LC ISO 019–LC ISO 030,
and LC ISO 032–LC ISO 042) and consisted of a cumulative 82 lithic artifacts including
58 chipped stone debitage, two unifaces, 12 bifaces, four cores, four informal tools in the
form of modified flakes, one tested cobble, and one point. The remaining three isolated
finds were historic isolates consisting of a total of six artifacts, including one base
fragment from a medicine glass bottle with an Owens Illinois makers mark dated to 1943
(LC ISO 017) (Lockhart 2004, 2006), one horse shoe (LC ISO 018), one base fragment
from an olive green glass wine bottle base, two amethyst glass fragments, and one
transfer printed white ware (LC ISO 031).
A site was defined when five or more prehistoric artifacts were found within a 20 m² area
or when 10 or more historic-age artifacts of two or more artifact classes were found
within a 20 m² area. Since isolated finds fail to meet the criteria for a site, none of these
finds are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Architecture 1

88

The standing structures on the Architecture 1 site comprise a water delivery system
(Figure 5-44). The parcel on which Architecture 1 sits is associated with what was
originally the 1,476-acre John Williams Survey Abstract 490 (Figure 5-45). The heirs of
John Williams received the Abstract 490 tract as compensation for his military service
from January 1836 through May 1836, when he was killed. The parcel was patented in
1848 and then administered by John’s brother Robert, who also had land holdings in the
vicinity (General Land Office Patent 217, Certificate 9223). Both John and Robert
Williams were settlers in Matagorda County as part of the Old Three Hundred, Stephen

82 | March 2015

Phase I Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed La Cima Development Project,
Hays County, Texas

F. Austin’s first colony of settlers in Texas in the 1820s. The parcel was conveyed
numerous times through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Figure 5-45. John Williams Survey Abstract 490, Hays County, 1902.
The earliest structural components likely date from the late eighteenth or the early
nineteenth century. James L. Malone purchased a number of sub-parcels in the vicinity
of Architecture 1 between 1898 and 1902, totaling approximately 2,800 acres from the
Smithson, Williams, Maximillian, and Glasgow surveys (Hays County DB [HCDB] 37:445;

March 2015 | 83

Phase I Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed La Cima Development Project,
Hays County, Texas

40:237; 43:297). James Malone (1825–1904) served as the Hays County farm
superintendent during the Civil War, ensuring crop production continued uninterrupted
throughout the county. He was married to Eliza Pitts, daughter of General John D. Pitts,
who moved to San Marcos in 1847 and constructed its first residence. The Malones
owned a 1,000-acre farm outside of San Marcos, where they lived for more than 40
years. They sold the farm in 1892 and moved to San Marcos (Oudekerke 2011:23).
James Malone formed a company with his son, William D., purchasing the land on which
Architecture 1 sits.
The Malones conveyed the farm to N.E. Shands in 1906, two years after James
Malone’s death (HCDB 52:163). Shands paid $28,112 in consideration for the
approximately 2,800-acre parcel. In various volumes of The American Shorthorn Herd
Book, N.E. (Ninus) Shands is listed as owner of several bulls that were bred by William
D. Malone (Allen 1907:73). After Shands conveyed the property to H.G. Henne and
Adolph Holz in 1911 for $40,000, the parcel changed hands numerous times through
1946, when it was conveyed from J.H. and Larkie Sherrill to Harold and Joe Freeman
(HCDB 135:210). Freeman heirs owned the land until 2014, when it was sold to its
current owners, Lazy Oaks Ranch (4856:534).
The standing structures on Architecture 1 include a windmill with pump apparatus, a
water tank, a concrete trough, and a corral/pen. The estimated age of the various
structures is difficult to gauge, as many are pieced together from other structures using
non-original materials. What appears to be the oldest structure on the site is the
concrete/stone/brick plinth under the repurposed water tank. The water tank is inscribed
with lettering indicating its original association with aircraft-related usage (Figure 5-Figure
5-46), but a found brick in the vicinity of the tank shows part of the plinth to be
constructed of brick manufactured by M. Valdez of Laredo (Figure 5-47).

Advertisements for “M. Valdez Wholesale and Retail Groceries and Brick Manufacturing”
appeared in The Laredo Times in 1896 through the turn of the century (The Laredo
Times 1896:1). Advertisements in 1899 list him as the successor to A. Thaison, who
relocated his brickmaking operation from Austin to Laredo in 1881, establishing the
Laredo Brick Works. Thaison died in 1898 (Holloway 2010). Valdez advertised that his
brickyard’s capacity was 30,000 bricks per day (The Laredo Times 1899:1).
Other components on the site include a combination of metal and wood corral fencing
and a concrete trough, likely from the post-World War II era (Figure 5-48). There were no
indications of date stamped on the windmill, although the concrete pump housing
appears to use a different concrete mix than the trough (Figure 5-49).
The Architecture 1 site is recommended not eligible for listing on the NRHP. As a
collection of outbuildings and structures difficult to date, but cobbled together from
disparate materials and origins, it does not meet NRHP qualification standards under
Criterion A for Agriculture or Criterion C for Architecture. While the parcel has been
associated with families relevant to Texas and Hays County history in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, it has been used primarily as a ranching outpost, not as any family’s
main ranch interest or center of operations, so it does not qualify under Criterion B for
association with significant persons. The site is also unlikely to yield information essential
to the understanding of the archaeological narrative of the county, region, or state
(Criterion D).

5.3.2

Architecture 2
The standing structures comprising Architecture 2 are a barn and corral/pen system with
watering facilities (Figure 5-50). The parcel on which Architecture 2 sits is currently
associated with William Burke Abstract 68. Over the years, however, neighbors in this
vicinity modified property lines to accommodate existing fencing and usage. In addition,
long-term owners consolidated and subdivided tracts: Abstract 68 was patented as a
1,280-acre parcel and now covers almost 1,400 acres. Architecture 2 is located on what
was originally the 1,476-acre John Williams Abstract 490, the same abstract as
Architecture 1 (see Figure 5-46).

(Source: Pictometry Online 2014)

Figure 5-50. Architecture 2, Aerial View.
The patent information for Architecture 2 is the same as Architecture 1. The heirs of John
Williams received the Abstract 490 tract as compensation for his military service from
January 1836 through May 1836, when he was killed. The parcel was patented in 1848
and then administered by John’s brother Robert, who also had land holdings in the
vicinity (General Land Office Patent 217, Certificate 9223). Both John and Robert
Williams were settlers in Matagorda County as part of the Old Three Hundred, Stephen
F. Austin’s first colony of settlers in Texas in the 1820s. The parcel, which appears to
have been used strictly for ranching purposes throughout its history, traded hands
several times through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
When John Harvey and Velma Robinson acquired a 1,499-acre tract from Lee E. and
Maud A. Posey in 1941, it was described as the William Burke Abstract 68 tract (HCDB
123:466). In addition, a deed agreement was filed in 1942 between the Robinsons and
E.E. and Nora Posey, their neighbors to the southeast, clarifying the boundary between
their two holdings, accepting an existing fence, while not situated along the surveyed
parcel boundary, to serve as the legal boundary, for $10 consideration to be paid by the
Robinsons (HCDB 124:496). The land associated with the Architecture 2 site may have
been a part of this transaction.

88 | March 2015

Phase I Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed La Cima Development Project,
Hays County, Texas

The Robinsons ranched approximately 20,000 acres of land in Texas, with their main
16,000-acre ranch operating out of northeast Jackson County. The Robinsons continued
to own the land associated with Architecture 2 through Velma’s death in 1998,
whereupon it was held by her estate and, after a series of legal contestations, it was
conveyed to real estate investors in 2006 (HCDB 3006:256). The most significant
modification to the tract took place in 1979, when Mrs. Robinson donated 200 acres to
serve as the new campus of the San Marcos Baptist Academy. The new campus opened
in 1982, and Mrs. Robinson served on its board from 1964 to 1985 (The Baptist Standard
2014). A campus street was named in her honor in 2014.
The standing structures on Architecture 2 include a barn, corral, and an animal watering
system. The barn is a wood-framed, L-plan, two-part structure (Figure 5-51). The
enclosed, double-height, gabled western section is set on a concrete foundation and has
corrugated metal panel wall and roof cladding (Figure 5-52). It has two large openings,
one each on the south and east elevations, to facilitate animal passage. Gates on the
openings are metal-framed with horizontal wood slats (Figure 5-53). The barn also has a
shed-roofed eastern section that is open on the south and east elevations, with most of
the north elevation clad in corrugated metal panels at the base and then board-andbatten wood panels above (Figure 5-54). One bay of this elevation is open, with three
horizontal wood slats in place to maintain ventilation.
Other components on the site include a combination of metal and wood corral fencing,
metal cattle squeeze chutes, concrete troughs (Figure 5-55), metal troughs, a windmill
with pump apparatus, and metal water tank (Figure 5-56). These structures were likely
installed at the same time as the barn, serving as the containment and watering system
for the ranch’s cattle.
The Architecture 2 site is recommended not eligible for listing on the NRHP. As a
collection of outbuildings and structures likely dating to the 1940s, but not associated
with a larger ranching system or homestead, it does not meet NRHP qualification
standards under Criterion A for Agriculture. While the parcel has been associated with
families relevant to Texas and Hays County history in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, it has been used only as a ranching outpost, not as any family’s main ranch
interest or center of operations, so it does not qualify under Criterion B for association
with significant persons. The structures are standard examples of common constructions,
so they do not qualify under Criterion C for Architecture. The site is also unlikely to yield
information essential to the understanding of the archaeological narrative of the county,
region, or state (Criterion D).

Summary and Recommendations

6.1

National Register Eligibility

6.1.1

Criteria for Evaluation of Eligibility
As part of the review process, cultural resources investigations are undertaken with the
purpose of identifying resources that are listed on, or eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places. The assessment of significance of cultural resources is
based on federal guidelines and regulations. Any cultural resource that is listed on or
eligible for inclusion in the National Register is known as a “historic property,” and the
term “eligible for inclusion in the National Register” includes both properties formally
determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet
National Register listing criteria (36 CFR §800.2). The criteria for evaluating properties
for inclusion in the National Register (36 CFR §60.4 [a–d]) are codified under the
authority of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set forth guidelines to use in determining
site eligibility. Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related
research questions, these four criteria for eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering,
and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess
integrity of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or
d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history. Note that the application of Criterion D presupposes that the information
imparted by the site is significant in history or prehistory [36 CFR §60.4,
emphasis added].
The physical characteristics and historic significance of the overall property are
examined when conducting NRHP evaluations. Although a property in its entirety may be
considered eligible based on Criteria A, B, C, and/or D, specific data are also required for
individual components therein based on date, function, history, physical characteristics,
and other information. Resources that do not relate in a significant way to the overall
property may contribute if they independently meet the National Register criteria.
The scientific value of archaeological sites is assessed under Criterion D. With regard
specifically to this criterion, the goal of prehistoric archaeological research and
management is to fill gaps in our knowledge about specific research domains. Scientific
importance is partially driven by the research paradigms of the time and in part by the

March 2015 | 93

Phase I Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed La Cima Development Project,
Hays County, Texas

amount of information available about a particular research topic in a specific geographic
area. The most robust forms of scientific importance should honor diverse and
occasionally competing schools of research interests and their attendant approaches. To
fulfill Criterion D, a site must possess certain attributes, such as intact buried cultural
strata with functionally and temporally diagnostic materials, datable cultural features, and
so on, such that further intensive research at the site could be expected to add additional
information to relevant research questions.
The research domains are addressed through testing and excavation programs; over
time, data required for addressing specific questions are collected, analyzed, and
compiled. Eventually, the potential importance, or significance, of sites that contain only
the types of data already collected may diminish. This suggests the identification criteria
of important historic properties are tied to both a specific geographic area reflecting a
cultural adaptation or cultural region and a state of accumulated knowledge about a
research domain topic. The criteria and priorities of important sites are apt to shift as
accepted research paradigms change or as data accumulations approach redundancy.
Archaeological sites that retain contextual integrity and contain artifacts and features
capable of contributing information toward addressing relevant research issues are
significant and should therefore be considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

6.1.2

State Antiquity Landmark
At the state level, archaeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized
or designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. The archaeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of
Texas or one of its political subdivisions; or
2. The archaeological site is situated on private land which has been specifically
designated as an SAL and fits at least one of the following criteria:
A. Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard
archaeological techniques to advantage;
B. The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s
original characteristics can be defined through investigation;
C. The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative cultural history by the
addition of new information;
D. The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
E. The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theories, or
methods of preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas
Natural Resources Code 1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities
Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7, Antiquities Code of Texas].

6.2.2

Conclusion
During the course of the intensive cultural resources investigation of the proposed project
area, a total of 1,247 acres (505 hectares) were pedestrian surveyed within the La Cima
APE. A total of 14 archaeological sites, 42 archaeological isolated finds, one site revisit
(41HY153), and two architectural resources were recorded.
All 14 archaeological sites were evaluated to determine eligibility for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under Criterion D, and for listing as a SAL
under Criterion 2. All are recommended not eligible. The isolated finds, by definition, do
not meet the requirements of site designation and are not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP. The recorded location of site 41HY153 was revisited, but no cultural evidence
could be detected during the pedestrian survey performed of the area. Two architectural
resources were evaluated to determine eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria
A, B, C, and D, and are recommended not eligible.
As a result of the present survey, it is recommended that the construction of the
proposed development at La Cima is not likely to affect cultural resources within the
APE. However, should in situ cultural deposits be encountered during the construction,
construction should cease and the Texas SHPO and state archaeologist should be
notified.
