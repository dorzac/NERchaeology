Archeological Survey of a Proposed Five-Acre Detention Pond along FM 2978, Montgomery County, Texas

Abstract
In May of 2016, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an intensive
archeological survey for a proposed detention pond along FM 2978 in Montgomery County,
Texas (CSJ No. 3050-02-024). The total project area covers five acres, all of which will be
utilized as a detention pond. AmaTerra conducted the archeological survey under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 7638.
Archeological investigations consisted of a pedestrian survey and the manual excavation
of nine shovel tests within the Area of Potential Effect (APE). Field archeologists observed
numerous landscape modifications resulting from previous drainage alterations and other
earth-moving activities. No archeological sites were recorded during field investigations
and one isolated scatter of bricks was documented within the project area. The brick
scatter is a recent dump located on top of a berm. Based on the results of AmaTerra’s
field investigations, no additional archeological work within the surveyed areas of the APE
are warranted at this time. No artifacts were collected during this survey. All documents
and photographs generated during this survey will be permanently curated at the Texas
Archeological Laboratory in Austin.

Chapter 1

Introduction and Project Description
In May of 2016, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological
survey in advance of a proposed construction of a detention pond by the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) along Farm-to-Market (FM) 2978 in south-central Montgomery
County, Texas (CSJ No. 3050-02-024). The project is located on five acres approximately
1,600 feet south of Woodlands Parkway along FM 2978 (Figure 1).
Currently, a small depression is serving as a runoff pond on undeveloped land along the
west side of FM 2978. The new detention pond will be located within an area measuring
approximately 400 feet north/south by 600 feet east/west. The proposed detention pond
will be set back 300 feet west from the existing FM 2978 right-of-way (ROW) (Figure 2).
Current project schematics are attached (Appendix B).
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archeological resources is defined as the footprint of
the proposed project to the maximum depth of impact(s), including all easements, detention
pond locations, and project specific staging locations. Thus, the APE for archeological
resources will cover a total area of five acres to a depth of up to ten feet.
The project is being funded by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). In addition,
the proposed project will involve land controlled by a political subdivision of the State of
Texas. Since the proposed project will be built using FHWA funds on land controlled by
the State of Texas, the project is subject to the rules and regulations outlined by Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (Section 106), as
well as the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Therefore, AmaTerra’s work conformed to the
guidelines under 36 CFR Part 800 and 13 TAC Chapter 26, which outline the regulations
for implementing Section 106 and ACT, respectively.
Coordination with the TxDOT resulted in a survey recommendation for the entire APE.
Archeological investigations consisted of a pedestrian survey, and shovel testing of all
portions of the APE. Field investigations took place on May 11, 2016 under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 7638. Joel Butler acted as Principal Investigator and Katherine Seikel served
as Project Archeologist. A total of 20 person hours were expended in the field in support of
this project. No artifacts were collected during this survey. All documents and photographs
generated during fieldwork for this project will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL).
This report is divided into six chapters. The project background and cultural overview are
discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 4 includes the field methodology implemented
during the project and the results of field investigations are discussed in Chapter 5.
Chapter 6 presents the summary and recommendations. Appendix A contains the shovel
test locations and Appendix B includes current schematics and profiles.

Chapter 2

Project Background
The project area is located within the western edge of The Woodlands community east of
Magnolia, Texas in an area that in undergoing extensive development. However, historic
maps and aerial imagery dating to the 1950s indicates that the project location has never
been developed and has contained a pond (or its dry depression) for at least 60 years.
Residential and commercial development around the project area has increased in the
last 10 years in connection to suburban growth associated with the expansion of Houston.
Environmental Setting
The APE lies within the South Central Plains Level III Ecoregion (Omernik and Griffith
2013). Locally known as the Piney Woods, this ecoregion is dominated by low rolling hills
punctuated by incised drainages and vegetated predominantly by pine forests of long leaf
and loblolly interspersed with hardwood species such as pin and white oak, black walnut,
mockernut hickory, and birch. Subjected to extensive logging during the early 20th century,
few stands of virgin timber exist.
Common fauna in this region include swamp rabbit (sylvilagus aquaticus), plains pocket
gopher (Geomys bursarius), nutria (Myocaster coypus), scissor tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus
forficatus), killdeer (Charadrius vociferous), coyote (Canis latrans), hog-nosed skunk
(Conepatus leuconotus), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Texas blind
snake (Leptotyphlops dulcis), Gulf Coast toad (bufo valliceps), and diamondback terrapin
(Malaclemys terrapin).
Topography
Overall, the APE is flat plain, with very little variation in the topography. There is an
ephemeral drainage swale that runs through the APE from east to west.
Geology and Soils
Geologically, the region is underlain by the Willis formation, dating to the Pliocene and
Pleistocene Epochs. The Willis formation is made up primarily of alluvially deposited coarse
sands, clays, and mixed small siliceous gravels (Stoeser et al 2005).
Within the project APE, soils consist of two different units: Boy fine sand and Conroe loamy
fine sand. (USDA-NRCS 2016) (Figure 3). These are moderately deep, well-drained yet
slowly permeable sandy soils, developed in place on uplands with fine sand to depths of
30–50 inches underlain by sandy clays and clay loams. No Holocene alluvium is located
within the APE.

Land Modifications and Historical Land Use
An inspection of historic maps and aerial imagery revealed that the project location has
never been developed and has contained the pond depression for at least 60 years. In a
1958 aerial photograph (Figure 4), the pond can be seen to be an earthen-dam stock pond
on the north side of a cleared area containing a homestead located 100 meters (328 feet)
south of the pond. No historic maps or aerial photographs depict historic structures within
the APE. Aerial imagery during the past ten years indicates that the pond is rarely full now
after being altered to drain beneath FM 2978 sometime after 2006. Previous impacts
from repeated drainage alterations have disturbed approximately three acres (60 percent)
of the project area.
Archeological Site Potential
The fine sandy upland soil has medium potential for containing intact archeological
deposits. The historic map and aerial photographs assessed by archeologists indicated
that historically no structures were ever located within the APE, suggesting low potential for
historic-age archeological deposits with the exception of potential household trash dumps
from the adjacent homestead seen in the 1950s aerial images. Several archeological
surveys have been conducted within or near the APE finding no archeological sites within
one kilometer (0.62 miles) of the APE.
According to the Potential Archeological Liability Mapping (PALM) for TxDOT’s Houston
District (Abbott 2001), the soils within the APE have some potential for prehistoric
archeological remains (Figure 5). Map Unit 2 encompasses the entire APE (with the
exception of the pond area). According to Abbott’s model, areas identified as Unit 2 have
potential for archeological remains on the surface or shallowly buried with no trenching
recommended.
Based on previous surveys, local soils, historic maps and imagery, and the Houston PALM,
it was determined that any prehistoric archeological sites encountered within the project
area could be potentially intact and stratified to depths of up to one meter (3.2 feet) or, in
the case of historic-age sites, be present as a scattered at or near the surface.

Chapter 3

Cultural Background
Within the state of Texas, archeological regions of the state tend to reflect that of
topographical settings. This division is seen in Turner and Hester’s (1999) model of the
archeological regions of Texas, where Texas is divided in to nine archeological regions, all
based on geography. Although the divisions of Turner and Hester’s (1999) are generally
accepted, Perttula (2004) further divides these regions into 16 distinct archeological
regions based on physiographic zones and biotic communities. Both models are used
interchangeably by archeologists when describing and defining the cultural chronology
of their project area. Despite these regional breakdowns of the archeological areas of
Texas, not all archeological sites fall within the clear cut chronological sequences provided
for these areas. In some cases archeological sites may lie at the cusp or confluence of
two or three distinct archeological regions, therefore reflecting different aspects of those
different regions. In cases such as these, rather than confining to one regional chronological
sequence, chronological sequences of the surrounding regions must also be taken into
consideration.
The project area is located in the Piney Woods Region of Southeast Texas. This region
has been extensively researched, and comprehensive chronological sequences have been
established (Turner and Hester 1999). According to research conducted at archeological
sites in this region, evidence of human occupation in the region roughly spans 12,000 years
before present (BP). These 12,000 years of occupation are typically divided into five main
periods, based on technological and cultural changes seen throughout the archeological
record. These five main periods are as follows: the Paleoindian (12,000/11,500–
8,500/8,000 BP); the Archaic (8500/8000–2000/1500 BP); the Ceramic Period (2000
BP–1250 BP [AD 700]); the Late Prehistoric (AD 700–1650); and the Historic (AD 1650–
1950s). The following is a general overview of trends seen during each period, followed by
a discussion of what occurred in the Piney Woods Region of Southeast Texas.
Paleoindian (ca. 11,500–8000 BP)
Generally, there is a lack of data relating to the Paleoindian Period in Southeast Texas and
archeological excavation of any Paleoindian site has yet to be undertaken. While many
projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Folsom, Scottsbluff, and San Patrice have been
recovered, most were isolated, mixed, or surface finds, or found in excavations of later
contexts (Ricklis 2004). The distribution of artifacts suggests that most sites occur along
major streams or within major stream drainages.
Because of the paucity of evidence, no detailed understanding of settlement mobility and
subsistence patterns during the Paleoindian period in Southeast Texas has been developed.
What evidence does exist suggests that groups likely engaged in a mix of hunting and
gathering, and since many of the lithic tools recovered were made of materials that are
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

11

Archeological Survey of a Proposed Five-Acre Detention Pond along FM 2978, Montgomery County, Texas

sparse or absent in the region, extensive movement of people and materials over the
landscape has also been suggested (Ricklis 2004).
Archaic in Inland Southeast Texas (ca. 8000–1500 BP)
Many Archaic sites have been found in this region, mostly near major streams, and these
are represented by flaked stone dart points and other lithic tools. A general outline of
dart point chronology during this period in Southeast Texas is available (Ricklis 2004), yet
the lack of any other evidence (i.e., faunal, botanical, etc.), allows for little generalization
regarding subsistence strategies other than the suggestion that groups were likely engaged
in some form of hunting and gathering. By the Late Archaic period, the use of poor quality
and local lithic materials suggest reduced mobility and smaller, more localized territories.
The use of cemeteries in this region, most notably the Ernest Witte cemetery, became
increasingly important culturally by the Late Archaic period. These cemeteries could be
quite large and often contained grave goods. For example, Group 2 of the Ernest Witte
cemetery contained 145 individuals along with lithic debris, bone pins, and shell beads
and pendants.
Archaic sites in the Coastal region of Southeast Texas consist mostly of shell middens.
Most are located along the shores of secondary bays or in and around river mouths and
deltas (Ricklis 2004). The most complete Archaic sequence of occupation in this region
was recovered from the Eagle’s Ridge site, a densely stratified shell midden. A large sample
of features and artifacts from the earliest part of the period to the latest were recovered
at the midden, which contains mostly Rangia cuneata, but also oyster shells. By the Late
Archaic (ca. 3,000 BP), the increase in number of sites discovered has led researchers to
suggest significant population growth occurred during this period.
Ceramic (ca 2,000–1,250 BP [700 AD])
The Ceramic Period in Southeast Texas has been defined as the point at which ceramics
first appeared, and thus signaling the end of the Archaic Period. During the Early Ceramic
period, while ceramics were introduced from Louisiana and the Lower Mississippi Valley,
there is not much evidence of major changes in lifeways. Ceramic Period artifacts recovered
overlying Archaic ones near river drainages suggest consistent patterns in subsistence and
settlement over time. Story et al. (1990) coined the term Mossy Grove Tradition/Culture
to describe groups that occupied areas surrounding Galveston Bay (including the current
project area) during the Ceramic Period.
Late Prehistoric (ca. 700–1650 AD)
This period is usually defined by the introduction of the bow and arrow. Evidence from
the Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) suggests that the Late Prehistoric in Southeast Texas
can be divided into the Initial Late Prehistoric sub-period, represented by Scallorn arrow
points, and the Final Late Prehistoric sub-period. The Final Late period correlates with the

well-documented Toyah phase, as defined by an abundance of bison bone and a lithic
assemblage geared towards the processing of the meat and hides of large game (Ricklis
2004).
Historic (1650–1950s AD)
The Historic Period in Texas begins with the arrival of the Spanish explorer Cabeza de
Vaca in 1528. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the French and Spanish
made forays into Texas for the sake of exploration and trade, though no permanent
European settlements were successful until the late seventeenth century. Archeological
sites dating to this period contain a mix of both European (e.g., metal and glass arrow
points, trade beads, and wheel-made or glazed ceramics) and traditional Native American
artifacts (e.g., manufactured stone tools). The effect that Europeans had on Indians in
Texas prior to about 1700 is not well-understood. What is known is that the initial wave
of Spanish and French missionaries and explorers spread disease that killed, displaced,
and fragmented a huge percentage of the population. As colonization spread from Mexico,
many of the Coahuiltecan groups moved northward to avoid the Spanish. At the same time,
invading Indian groups from the north put pressure on Native American groups in North
Texas (Nickels et al. 1997). Historians believe that these pressures led to intense territorial
disputes, further destabilizing Native American populations.
Although it was not officially established until 1837, settlement in Montgomery County
began in the 1820s as part of Stephen F. Austin’s original colonization efforts. Initial
settlers in Montgomery County were 42 of Austin’s original 297 families who are known as
the Old Three Hundred (TSHA 2016). Many abandoned their homes during the Runaway
Scrape of 1836 and returned to devastation. Afterward, the county seat of Montgomery
became a thriving economic center.
Slaves were an important factor in the early economy in Montgomery County. By 1850,
the slave population was 1,448 and in 1860, the slave population accounted for almost
half of the overall county population (TSHA 2016). Nearly two-thirds of the families in
Montgomery County owned one or more slaves in the 1850s and 1860s. Montgomery
County became dependent on the plantation economy, which produced over 8,000 bales
of cotton in 1860. Due to this economic structure, county residents overwhelmingly
supported secession and the Confederacy during the Civil War. Following the Civil War the
area suffered economically, and agricultural production dramatically decreased. Economic
recovery was slow after the Civil War.
At the close of the nineteenth century, the county’s economy remained dependent on
agriculture, but it was characterized by small farms and ranches and tenant farming (TSHA
2016). Commerce associated with the construction of the railways in the 1870s and 1880s
contributed to economic growth, but it could not account for agricultural productivity
losses due to soil depletion. Lumber became a major industry in Montgomery County in
the 1880s.

Slow economic growth continued into the twentieth century. The lumber industry began
to decline in the 1920s due to diminishing timber reserves, and the Great Depression
contributed to economic struggles in Montgomery County (TSHA 2016). The discovery of
oil in the early 1930s improved the local economy, and the production of oil and carbon
was the primary focus of industry in the 1940s as a mean to support the war effort.

Previous Investigations
Background research for this project consisted of an online records search through the THC’s
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas). Research focused on the identification of archeological
sites, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP), sites listed as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), neighborhood
surveys, cemeteries, and previously conducted archeological surveys within one kilometer
(0.62 mile) of the APE. According to the Atlas and the records at TARL, there are no previously
recorded archeological sites within the APE, however, three previous archeological surveys
have occurred within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE (Figure 6).
A 2012 survey of FM 2978 adjacent to the project area was carried out by HRA Gray and
Pape for TxDOT under TAC Permit 6053. This survey was limited to the road ROW and did
not cover any of the current project’s APE. Additionally, in 2011, Ecological Communications
Corporation (now AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.) surveyed for a San Jacinto River Authority
water pipeline approximately 50 meters (164 feet) east of the current project area. Finally,
Montgomery County carried out a survey approximately 900 meters (3,000 feet) east of
the project area in 1999. None of the surveys encountered archeological sites within one
kilometer (0.62 mile) of the project area.
No RTHLs, NRHP properties, SALs, or historical markers were found within one kilometer
(0.62 miles) of the project area. There are no resources which would be affected by the
proposed project activities.

Methodology
Prior to the field investigations, archeologists conducted archival research to assess the
potential for buried or near-surface historic archeological materials. This research involved
examining historical maps (Perry-Castañeda Library 2016) and aerial photographs (USGS
2016). As mentioned above, archeologists consulted soils and PALM data and the Atlas
to assess the potential for prehistoric archeological sites within the APE. Consulting these
resources not only allowed investigators to determine the presence of previously recorded
archeological sites within the APE, but also to gain a sense of site types (e.g., historic
or prehistoric), artifact types, and average depth of cultural material below the surface,
among other things.
Archeological investigations were carried out in accordance with the THC/CTA survey
standards (as referenced in 13 TAC 26.20 and THC policy). AmaTerra inspected the entire
available APE for direct impacts to the natural landscape. This inspection was conducted on
foot through visual reconnaissance. As a result, archeologists observed multiple areas of
disturbance, including soil berms and eroded areas. These areas were photographed and
archeologists made notes on the conditions they encountered during their investigations.
Archeologists shovel tested in some of these locations to confirm disturbance of soils.
As the proposed undertaking measured an area of five acres, the CTA-recommended
rate of two shovel tests per acre for areal surveys meant that up to 10 shovel tests were
proposed for this project. However, because over half of the project area was visibly
previously impacted by earth-moving activities, nine shovel tests distributed throughout
the APE in an effort to locate intact soils.
Shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and extended to a maximum depth of 80 cm
below the surface or until restrictive features (e.g., water or basal clay) were encountered.
The shovel tests were excavated in 10 cm increments and all soil was screened through
a ¼-inch hardware cloth. Relevant information for all shovel tests was recorded on a
standardized form. Shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. This archeological
investigation was a non-collection survey; therefore, artifacts encountered during the
course of the work were returned to their original location.
Archeological sites were to be defined using the THC/CTA standards (as referenced in
13 TAC 26.20). Thus, an archeological site had to contain a certain number of cultural
materials or features older than 50 years of age within a given area. The definition of a
site is: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 15-m (50-foot) radius; (2) a single cultural
feature, such as a midden or cistern, observed on the surface or exposed during shovel
testing; (3) a positive shovel test containing at least five total artifacts; or (4) two positive
shovel tests located within 30 m (98 feet) of each other. Archeologists did not document
any archeological material which met these criteria.

Results
AmaTerra archeologists Joel
Butler and Katherine Seikel
surveyed the APE through visual
inspection and shovel testing
on May 11, 2016. They found
the terrain to be largely flat
and open, interspersed with
trees and shrubs. A few areas
outwardly displayed impacts
from the creation of soil berms
and drainage erosion (Figures 7
and 8). Much of the project area
is characterized by the presence
of elevated berms formed
through the moving and grading
of soils along the cut drainage,
which runs through the project
area west to east.

Figure 7. View of the center of the project area with
an elevated berm in the center, facing east.

Investigators had access to the entire
project area, and surveyed all five acres.
The visual survey included a walkover
inspection of the ground surface within the
ROW. The only potential artifacts observed
during the visual inspection were a scatter of
mortared bricks, which have been dumped
on the soil berm in the southeastern part
of the project area (Figure 9). It is unclear
when the bricks were discarded and they
cannot be attributed to a nearby historicage structure.
In addition to the visual inspection, nine
shovel tests were excavated in order
to evaluate the APE for the presence
of subsurface archeological deposits
(Figure 10). Surface visibility ranged from
poor in areas overgrown with grasses to
good, particularly on berms and eroded
surfaces. A typical soil profile in undisturbed

areas of the APE consisted of a light yellow-grey (10YR7/3) sand overlying an orangebrown (10YR5/8) clay mixed with iron oxide concretions. In disturbed areas a mottled clay
containing iron oxide concretions was present on the surface (Figure 11). Shovel tests were
typically terminated around 20 cmbs due to disturbance and/or concretion-rich mottled
clay, though shovel tests in undisturbed soils terminated around 60 cmbs. All of the shovel
tests were negative and no cultural materials were observed.

Conclusions and Recommendations
On May 11, 2016, AmaTerra surveyed the proposed detention pond along FM 2978 in
Montgomery County, Texas. The project was conducted under the ACT and Section 106 of
the NHPA and all work conformed to the guidelines for implementation of these regulations
under 13 TAC Chapter 26 as well as 36 CFR 800. Because work was conducted in
conjunction with TxDOT, all work was subject to Section 106 review.
AmaTerra archeologists conducted an intensive archeological survey of the proposed
detention pond location totaling five acres of land. One hundred percent of the APE
was surveyed. The survey included a visual inspection and nine shovel tests. The visual
inspection revealed an APE heavily impacted by previous drainage modifications. Shovel
testing revealed disturbed soils (orange-brown mottled clays) on the surface throughout
much of the APE. Shovel tests were distributed across the APE to confirm disturbance and
identify intact soils, which may have contained cultural deposits. No cultural material was
encountered during shovel testing, and a scatter of mortared bricks of unknown origin
were observed during the visual inspection.
No archeological deposits were encountered, and no sites were recorded during the survey.
The proposed undertaking would then have no effect on significant cultural resources in
this area, and AmaTerra recommends no further archeological investigations.
In the unlikely event that construction activities should contact significant archeological
deposits in areas already surveyed, all work in the vicinity should cease until such time
as those materials can be evaluated by a professional archeologist and the results of that
evaluation are reported to the THC.
This report is submitted in fulfillment of Antiquities Permit No. 7638. No artifacts were
collected during this survey. All documents and photographs generated during fieldwork
for this project will be curated at TARL.
