SOUTHERN ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONSULTANTS, INC.
REPORT OF INVESTIGATIONS

July 2010
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5703

Abstract
During July of 2010, Southern Archaeological Consultants, Inc. carried out cultural resources monitoring in
an area of subsurface boring where the Brownsville Public Utilities Board (PUB), was installing a new force
main. This area is adjacent to the historic Brownsville Cemetery property and between the cemetery and the
Town Resaca. Indeed the entire area represents a filled in resaca channel and this factor is extremely
important to understanding the nature of the archaeological situation and the conditions and obstructions
encountered by the boring machine.
This investigation involved monitoring of boring in an area some 12 feet beneath the present ground surface.
No cultural resources were recorded during the survey and no further work is recommended in the area. The
lack of cultural materials is attributed primarily to disturbance and/or artificial filling operations.

During mid-July of 2010, Southern Archaeological Consultants carried out cultural resources
monitoring operations at the Resaca Force Main Transfer Lift Station (LS) 33 in Brownsville,
Texas. This location is adjacent to the historic Brownsville Cemetery and occupies an area of
artificial fill between the cemetery and the Town Resaca. This is a Federally funded project and
is covered under procedures defined under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L.
89-665), as amended; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (P.L. 91-190); Executive
Order 11593, "Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment", 13 May 1971 (36 CFR
Part 800); Preservation of Historic and Archaeological Data, 1974 (P.L. 98-291, as amended;
and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, "Procedures for Protection of Historic and
Cultural Properties" (36 CFR Part 800) and the Texas Antiquities Code. Therefore, a Texas
Historical Commission Antiquities Permit is required.

This project \consisted of five interlinked phases
Phase 1 Background and Literature Search
Phase 2 Map Review
Phase 3 Monitoring
Phase 4 Analysis
Phase 5 Report Preparation and Recommendations
The project is concerned with the location, recording and evaluation of any intact cultural
resources present within the affected area. This kind of project does not generally lend itself to
detailed research methodologies or comprehensive examinations of cultural process. Such
compliance oriented studies are primarily concerned with the practical rather than theoretical
issues.
Project Area
The project area is located wholly within the city limits of Brownsville, Texas and covers an
impact area of less than acre. This area is bounded by the cemetery on the south and the resaca
on the north so that it forms a narrow corridor of artificial fill that has been constructed both to

seperate the cemetety proper from the resaca and to provide space for other and previously
installed water lines and piping.

Culture History
The culture history of the Rio Grande Valley, especially its prehistoric component, is not well
understood. In large measure this is due to a basic lack of data (Prewitt 1974). Archaeological
sites have been recorded and in some cases, at least, investigated but almost without exception
these sites have been heavily disturbed cemeteries from which archaeologists have been able to
extract only limited data.
Prehistoric populations are believed to have been the predecessors of the Cohuiltecan groups
encountered by the first European explorers. They are believed to have practiced a nomadic
hunting and gathering way of life that stressed mobility and the exploitation of fish, shellfish and
plant products (Hester 1969). Presumably this way of life has been practiced from the time of
the earliest occupations with only slight alterations occurring with the adoption of such
technological innovations as the bow and arrow and the use of ceramics. As a result, the best
known of the defined cultural complexes, the Brownsville complex (MacNeish 1947) appears to
differ little from the preceding Archaic.
The Brownsville complex is characterized by large numbers of shell artifacts, Fresno,
Matamoros, Starr and Cameron arrowpoints and limited numbers of ceramics. This complex is
known almost entirely from heavily disturbed mortuary associations. As a result, some of the
assumptions about Brownsville complex culture may be unfounded and it is suspected that basic
chronological relationships are badly in need of revision (Collins, Hester and Weir 1969).
Populations encountered by the first European explorers and observers were nomadic huntersand-gatherers (Salinas 1990). The records of the first Spanish explorer, Alonso Alvarez de
Pineda, suggest as many as forty brush arbor settlements (ramadas) or rancherias were present
along the first sixteen miles of river channel (Salinas 1990:22) in 1519. Other documents
suggest that the Rio Grande delta was the most densely populated area of northeastern Mexico
and Southern Texas (Salinas 1990:139) if only because of the greater subsistence resources
available in the area. The project area is included within this area of higher population density
and, with the limited data presently available, almost any prehistoric site would add greatly to
our data base and predictive capability.
The historic period beginning with the first explorations of Pineda is better understood.
Nevertheless, there has been comparatively little work done with historic materials despite the
fact that the settlements established by Escandon on the Rio Grande River are some of the
earliest in what is now the United States. These settlements are generally associated with the
present course of the Rio Grande and are located north and west of the project area.

After the establishment of the Republic of Texas the area remained a Mexican holding until the
conclusion of the Mexican war in 1846. Indeed the first battle of that struggle were fought at
Palo Alto and the Resaca de la Palma in what would become Brownsville and the establishment
of the city dates to this time period. Skirmishing associated with these events could have taken
place within the project area but there is no collaborative evidence of such involvement. During
the Civil War this entire area was the scene of intermittent skirmishing by combatants
representing the United States, the Confederacy, the Mexican Republic and the Emperor
Maximillian. The cemetery was established in 1866 to replace the previous El Campo Santo
Viejo (Keller 2005) but did not actually begin to be utilized until some years later.
After the Civil War, the project area returned to its relatively undeveloped state. Land use was
dominated by open range and cattle production although Brownsville prospered as an entreport
and trading center. The establishment of intensive irrigation agriculture (Pierce 1917,
Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1954) in the early 1900's caused a fundamental change in the
lifestyle of Cameron County and Brownsville. The city became a major marketing center and
the largest United States city in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
Background and Literature Search
The general survey area, and indeed Cameron County has not been the scene of numerous
cultural resource investigations. This seems to be related both to a lack of Federal or State
supported projects and limited knowledge of the requirements. A background and literature
review was carried out at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas at
Austin and with the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas 2009, THC). The nearest recorded
archaeological site is 41CF188, a historic farmstead or residence, within the boundaries of the
Brownsville- South Padre Island International Airport. Culural resource surveys have also been
made in the vicinity of the Port of Brownsville, at borrow areas to the southwest of that facility
ans at scattered properties throughout the city but none of these included the project area.
Additional literature searches were carried out at the library of the University of TexasBrownsville, the Cameron County Courthouse, the Hidalgo County Historical Museum and the
Historical Collection in the Library of the University of Texas-Pan American. These resources
proved to be particularly valuable for the maps prepared for the International Boundary
Commissions in 1884, 1889, and 1900. These maps provide topographic evidence for active Rio
Grande River channels, resacas, cutoffs, bancos, oxbow lakes and historic occupations during the
period from 1853 to 1911.

Monitoring Procedures
Since this was a monitoring project, the survey procedures outlined in Archeological Survey
Standards for Texas, Minimum Survey Standards, were not applicable. Monitoring took place

only after an obstruction was encountered by the boring mechanism. Public Utility Board
employees advised the archaeologists that they were sure that the area was disturbed and
probably composed mostly of fill. However, since the project was Federally funded they felt it
prudent to have an archaeologist present to confirm that their operations were not impacting the
cemetery and that the boring mechanism had not encountered a grave ior human remains. To
identify the obstruction and clarify the nature of the subsurface deposits a trackhoe was utilized
to excavate an area measuring approximately ten feet (3.04 meters) by twenty feet (6.08 meters)
and twelve feet (3.65 meters) in depth. Archaeologists were present on site for approximately
1.5 days until the nature of the situation had been clarified. The obstruction was identified as the
portion of a buried seawall or bulkhead.

Figure 3: Portion of USGS East Brownsville quadrsngle showing position of cemetery.

There are three large water pipes buried in this fill at depths of between 8 and 10 feet beneath the
surface. The new water pipe, which is approximately 4 feet in diameter will replace these pipes
but it is more efficient to perform a directional bore rarther than excavating a new trench and
removing the existing piping. These pipes are believed to date from the1940âs and 1950âs. One
of these pipes is lined with asbestos and this material is supposed to have been phased out before
1950.
Two of these pipes are located above the buried seawall and one of them appears to rest, in part,
on that construction (see attached photograph). During the investigation this pipe, although
abandoned, continued to leak. The bulkhead was constructed of relatively modern treated

Figure 4: Trenched area showing exterior plywood pieces and portion of sea wall exposed
under leaking and previously installed water pipe.
exterior plywood and the support members were modern dimensional lumber. Thus, the 2x4
actually measured 1 and 3/4 inches by 3 and 3/4 inches.
Results
No significant cultural resources were discovered or recorded during this survey. Observation
indicates that the area of subsurface boring is composed almost entirely of artificial fill and that
the location is essentially a filled resaca channel. This is indicated by the presence of a buried
seawall/bulkhead under the waterpipes buried about 8 feet below the present ground surface.

There is a similiar structure present on the other side of the existing resaca channel. Another
suggestion of the presence of fill is large number of debris items such as bricks, cement blocks,
and large pieces of waste concrete intermixed into the heavy clay fill. Disturbance by modern
activities is, therefore, a primary factor operating in this location. It seems quite evident that the
cemetery itself was not influenced by this episode of rechannelization, filling, and pipe
implacement. Instead the area of the cemetery was actually increased and potential erosional
problems on the cemetery edges were curtailed. The Public Utilities Board records on this area
are limited but personnel advised the archaeologists that they knew the area was disturbed.
Conclusions
No cultural resources were recorded and there are no previously recorded archaeological sites,
prehistoric or historic, within the project area. As a result, no further work is recommended
within the area being monitored.
