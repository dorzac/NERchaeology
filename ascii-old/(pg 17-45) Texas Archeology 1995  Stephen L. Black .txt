(Texas) Archeology 1995
Stephen L. Black

INTRODUCTION

end, the reader will find specific notions about
needed changes and the expected evolution of Texas

As the 20th century comes to a close, it is
appropriate that archeologists find time to take stock
of our discipline and begin to think long and hard
about its future. Ideally, archeology of the 21st
century should be structured so that it combines the
best of our present traditions with new ideas, methods, and technologies. However, before the headlong course of any discipline such as archeology
can be (re)directed, the intimate workings of that
field of research need to be revealed. The
discipline’s organization and formal nature have to
be explained, as well as its methods of financing.
The nature of the relationships among the players
must be understood and the human behavior that
transpires has to be disclosed.
In this essay I advocate and attempt to stimulate positive improvement by contrasting the good
things about Texas archeology 1995 with the bad.
When I look at Texas archeology, I see great promise along with grievous problems, colored black,
white, and a thousand shades of gray. I see more
money and time being spent in the name of archeology than ever before. I see ethical and capable
individuals and organizations that are devoted to
realizing the wonderful archeo!ogical opportunities
afforded by the in-the-ground archeological record
that yet survives in this state. Yet, I also see the
very same opportunities being dashed by greed,
incompetence, and malfeasance. I wonder if this
perplexing mismatch is inevitable or if the (Texas)
archeology of the future will be a marked improvement on what we have today.
I will begin by explaining my motivation and
reviewing certain general aspects of the discipline
of archeology in North America, and then go on to
treat the practices of Texas archeo!ogy in particular.
Wishing to avoid the hemlock proffered Socrates,
criticisms and faults are accompanied by possible
remedies, and are usually not personalized. In fact,
a number of recommendations for improvement
appear throughout this essay and, near the paper’s

archeology. Beyond the turn of the century, (Texas)
archeology will surely differ from what it is today.
Changing technology, improvements in datarecording and information-sharing methods, shifts
in social values, and perhaps major changes in
governmental support and regulation (control) are
all to be expected.
Many changes will occur automatically in the
new milieu, as American social structure, educational systems, and bureaucracies, as well as world
technologies, evolve (and occasionally devolve).
However that might be, Texas arche-ologists of all
stripes will not be trapped in an evolutionary cycle
entirely beyond our control. Techniques of research
can be chosen or rejected, and used wisely or foolishly. Organizational formats of a bureaucratic nature can be altered and redirected, and ethical
professional and personal values can be inculcated.
As we approach the 21st century, Texas archeologists, professional and avocational alike, will need
to reaffirm our commitment to basic principles and
responsibilities.

THE AUTHOR

The reader may wonder, rightly, about my
background and motivation as author of an article
that presumes to assess the state of the archeology
of the "great state." I offer a somewhat lengthy
accounting of my "archeological lineage" because
I am convinced that the historical connections
(mentors, colleagues, education, field experiences,
etc.) that form one’s archeological background
largely determine one’s contributions, for better or
worse, to the discipline (see Black 1990a). I first
deve!oped an uninformed interest in archeology as
a suburban teenager who loved reading adventure
and historical novels; these fostered an unabidding
curiosity about the cultural world and the human
past. The first site I knowingly saw was a burned

rock midden a few miles from my north Austin
home that was in the process of being obliterated
by relic collectors in advance of urban
development. Later, as a student at the University
of Texas at Austin, I decided to major in
Archeological Studies after taking my first courses
from Professors E. Mott Davis, T. N. Campbell,
and Dee Ann Story. My undergraduate education
and some minor field experience gave me a decent
appreciation of basic archeological principles.
However, upon graduation in 1976 I could not
write competently and truly did not appreciate the
difficulties involved in meaningfully relating the
static past (what archeologists find) to the onceliving people who created that human past. I also
had little clue as to how I might make a career out
of archeology.
On the verge of reading employment ads, a
phone call from Thomas R. Hester, Director of the
Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at the
University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) led to
a one-week job surveying in Karnes County with
the inimitable Co!. Thomas C. Kelly. My one week
evolved into a nine-year stint doing "contract"
archeology at UTSA, during which I climbed the
ladder of archeological responsibility from crew
member, to crew chief, to assistant project director,
to project director. I worked on surveys, testing
programs, and excavations at many prehistoric and
a few historic sites from the Balcones Escarpment
southward. This experience, particularly the endless
year spent working under Grant D. Hall in what
would become Choke Canyon Reservoir, gave me
a more solid connection to the natural landscape
than city life ever had. From my first real mentor,
Tom Hester, I learned to view contract archeology
as an opportunity to do basic research while
performing a needed service for federal agencies,
small town governments, and mining companies.
As I assumed greater responsibility, I gradually
learned to organize archeological data and express
my understandings in writing, especially while
following through with the excavations at the
Panther Springs Creek site (Black and McGraw
1985) and the Hinojosa site (Black 1986). Most
importantly, however, I made many friends among
the fluid ranks of contract archeology crews and
the earnest members of the Southern Texas
Archaeological Association (STAA). Along the way
I earned a Master of arts degree in anthropology
from UTSA and was introduced to archeology in

the land of the Maya, which seemed far more
appealing than digging test pits in Live Oak County.
I left Texas and went to Harvard University in
1984, to study Middle American archeology under
Gordon R. Willey, and to continue fieldwork near
the Maya center of Rfo Azul in northern Pet~n,
Guatemala under Richard E. W. Adams of UTSA
(himself a former student of Willey). However, I
soon found myself learning more about sociocultural and biological (physical) anthropology and archeology, as it is conceived and practiced across
the wide human world beyond and before North
America. Surprisingly, I learned more while
"teaching" discussion sections than I did from most
of my professors. The students asked the most
obvious and the most obscure questions--the
former by far the more challenging to address. This
training combined with the vivid cultural experience of living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, convinced me of two "big" ideas that I had not
adequately appreciated. One was that modern human cultures were so vastly varied and complex
that even trained observers-in-the-flesh were often
reduced to gross abstractions or trivial pursuits.
Social anthropologists, I learned, were almost inescapably ethnocentric despite genuine effort to be
otherwise, forcing me to understand that the same
had to be true of archeologists as well. The other
big idea was that for any archeological region or
topic there were many alternative approaches and
radically different ideas to be considered when
planning archeological strategies (such as how and
what to dig). In this regard, being one of the last
two of Gordon Willey’s long line of students
(Grant Hall was the other) was instrumental. The
Bowditch Professor Emeritus of Central American
Archaeology and Ethnology was very reflective
about roads he had taken and those he had not. Also
thought-provoking were conversations with Rosemary A. Joyce, an untenured faculty member who
challenged many of my favorite ideas. For my doctoral thesis I studied the historical development of
field methods and methodologies in lowland Maya
archeology (Black 1990b). Mayanists, I discovered, tended to follow the tracks of their predecessors rather nan’owly, walking right by, so to speak,
unimagined temples of the past hidden not by forest veil, but by archeological tradition.
After my final graduation, I taught and advised students at Harvard for a year while seeking
the tenure-track teaching job I trained for. Such

Black m (Texas) Archeology 1995

jobs are scarce and highly competitive (200 or
more applicants for every solid position). Happily,
in 1991 I moved back to Austin and began working as a Research Associate at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). There,
working once again under Tom Hester, I have been
directing and administering CRM projects sponsored by the Texas Department of Transportation.
Beyond the need for employment, I came back to
Texas because of family, archeological friends, and
my love for the land and its waters, but I came back
with a different outlook on archeology as it is practiced in the 28th state.
My break from contract archeology, time spent
doing archeology in Mesoamerica and studying and
teaching anthropology in Cambridge, gave me a
perspective on Texas archeology that I would not
possibly have gained ifI had stayed put. Back home,
the change from the archeological frontier of San
Antonio to the longtime hotbed of Austin opened
my eyes on Texas archeology as I had never seen it
before. For self-serving reasons, I developed an
intense interest in the workings of CRM archeology as I realized my career would be centered in
Texas instead of Mesoamerica. I asked questions,
developed and renewed contacts, and paid more
attention to what people did than to what they said.
I was able to see more clearly the opportunities and
the limitations, as well as the admirable and the
senseless aspects of archeology. I now feel compelled to speak out (Black 1993; Black and Shafer
1994), try different approaches (Black et al. 1993),
and participate more actively in community-wide
organizations such as the Texas Archeological Society and the Council of Texas Archeologists.
This essay, then, reflects my archeological
path, and those of my mentors and colleagues, as I
seek to describe how I think (Texas) archeology
works, for better and for worse, and where I hope
the discipline might go. Throughout, I try to
personify archeo!ogy by mentioning positive
examples of the colleagues and organizations that
I know best, knowing that I must omit mention of
many who should be lauded, particularly those who
work in areas of the state where I have not. As the
reader will have guessed, I put Texas in
parentheses from time to time to reinforce the point
that much of (North American) archeology knows
no political boundaries. I begin by explaining my
understanding of what archeology the discipline is
all about.

THE ARCHEOLOGISTS
Today as never before, archeology means many
different things to the many different individuals
who consider themselves archeologists. Most
American archeologists fall into one of three broad
groups: academic archeo!ogists, cultural resource
management (CRM) archeologists, and avocational
archeologists. Keep in mind that many individuals
participate in more than one group during their
archeological careers, and that finer distinctions can
and will be made.
Academic archeologists are the formally
trained holders of advanced degrees who teach,
theorize, and conduct scholarly research from the
bastions of the University. Academic faculty are
paid on a long-term basis (through the tenure system) to teach and to do scholarly research, although
most research funds except salary and basic infrastructure are obtained from outside sources (mostly
federal granting agencies, private foundations, and
private benefactors). Historically, it has been the
academic archeologists in North America who have
held the scholarly high road, written most of the
books and articles, trained the next generation of
archeologists, and done (or at least supervised) most
of the excavations. While at the present time there
are perhaps 30 to 40 tenured archeologists teaching
in universities and colleges in Texas, fewer than 10
are active in Texas archeology, as most have research interests elsewhere in the world. Academic
archeologists have contributed greatly (and not-sogreatly) to the development of Texas archeology.
In my view, the late Alex D. Krieger was one of the
finest scholars that has yet concentrated on the state,
although he did not hold a faculty position and left
Texas precipitously in 1956 because of wi~at he felt
was a lack of support from UT-Austin (Story 1993).
There are also smaller numbers of academically
trained archeologists who have research and
curatorial duties at regional and local museums.
The holders of such positions often operate in
isolation, preoccupied with the survival of the
professional niches they have found and the
direction of their institutions, more than research.
For example, Anna J. Taylor (of Quitaque, Texas)
has returned to her geographic roots at the
Panhandle-Plains Museum at Canyon. As Curator
of Archeological Collections, A. J. is helping the
museum deal with repatriation issues (see below)
and hoping to win a permanent position. Others,

20

Texas Archeological Society

such as Alex Barker, Curator of Archaeology at the
Dallas Museum of Natural History, are less isolated
and are able to interact with academics at major
schools (SMU, in Alex’s case). The premier
example of a museum-based academic position in
Texas archeology is the one Eileen Johnson has
carved out at the Lubbock Lake Landmark.
Since the early 1970s, the balance of archeological power (as reflected by funding) in North
America has increasingly shifted to the burgeoning
CRM subfield. Cultural Resource Management is
the preferred term today for what I previously labeled as contract archeology and which earlier generations called salvage archeology. The term CRM
comes from the 1960s and 1970s federal laws and
regulations which strengthened government commitments to the preservation of cultural resources
(including prehistoric and historic sites). The profound change in emphasis from salvaging information to "complying" with government regulation is
one that American archeology is still struggling to
come to grips with. Paradoxically, CRM funding
has been both boon and boondoggle.
CRM archeologists include researchers, bureaucrats, businessmen, and technicians that collectively comprise a majority of the membership of
the Society for American Archaeology (SAA), the
major national organization of professional archeologists. A much smaller number of these also belong to the Society of Professional Archeologists
(SOPA), an organization whose members are sworn
to uphold an ethical code and standards of performance. Today, almost all CRM archeologists, except for a few technicians, hold at least a B.A., with
many having a master’s degree, and some a Ph.D.
Broadly, the CRM archeologists can be sorted into
two piles, government and non-government.
The first includes those employed by the
federal and state governments or, less commonly,
local and regional governments and quasigovernmental entities (like the Lower Colorado
River Authority, or LCRA). Most CRM
archeologists employed in government are paid on
a long-term basis to regulate and administer CRM
archeology and, to a lesser extent, to actually do
archeological research. For example, Erwin Roemer
(of Elgin, Texas) works for the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers in Vicksburg, Mississippi. His job is to
make sure that the Corps complies with federal and
state archeo!ogical regulations as it builds and
maintains the nation’s reservoirs and waterways.

He travels often and coordinates research, but rarely
gets to participate directly in fieldwork. At the state
leve!, Margaret Howard Hines of Austin works for
the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, planning
and conducting archeological surveys to help
individual state parks protect and manage the many
obvious and not-so-obvious archeologica! sites they
contain. She spends more time than most state
government archeologists doing fieldwork, but her
work is limited to survey and testing projects.
Erwin and Margaret are two of many fine archeologists who have joined the governmental
branch of CRM archeology and have continued to
contribute to archeological research. However, as
is typical of all bureaucracies, there are many government archeologists who do not advance archeological research in any demonstrable way.
Regardless, over the last thirty years or so government has been a steadily growing and secure source
of employment, although this may soon be changing, especially at the federal level.
The growth in the number of non-government
CRM archeologists has been even more explosive,
and the highs and lows even more profound. In the
history of Texas archeology, most organized research was connected with the University of Texas
at Austin until the early 1970s. The establishment
of anthropology departments at other universities
in Texas, coupled with strengthened CRM laws,
led to the creation of organized archeological research units at Texas A&M University (TAMU),
Texas Tech University, Southern Methodist University (SMU), the University of North Texas
(UNT), UTSA, the University of Texas at E1 Paso,
and Stephen F. Austin University. While many of
these organized research units have operated mainly
within the regions in which they are located, others
sought contracts wherever opportunity has arisen.
However, the demand for CRM archeology has
been more than the universities could effectively
handle, and by the 1980s private consulting firms
brought American archeology into the free enterprise system both for better and for worse.
Firms such as Prewitt and Associates, Inc., of
Austin have been able to make a viable business of
complying with archeological regulations while accomplishing quality research, at the same time providing many up and coming archeologists with
training and research opportunities (Margaret, for
one). With such firms, the archeology seems to
come before profit. However, there are competing

Black ~ (Texas) Archeology 1995

organizations where the driving motive is clearly
profit and, as I perceive it, the quality of archeological research has often suffered as a direct consequence. One could cite unfavorable examples of
small firms run by Texas-bred archeologists, as well
as larger corporations in which Texas archeology is
only a convenient aspect of a wider portfolio of
endeavors intended strictly to garner profit. Despite
the setting, the quality of CRM archeology depends
on the integrity of the individual archeologists and
managers as much or more than that of the organization; if the archeological integrity of either is compromised, the quality of research suffers.
Today, private firms compete with the universities that still have contract programs, such as the
one at TARL. Some organized research units that
were active in the 1970s and 1980s, such as those
at SMU and Texas Tech, no longer exist. While as
a university-affiliated archeologist, I wish I were
able to assure the reader that the quasi-academic
setting always insures that quality research is the
top priority; any archeological organization, however, is only as good as its people. I use the term
"quasi-academic" because, as organized research
units, university CRM operations are typically
housed separately from, and are not effectively
integrated with, the teaching faculty. The Center
for Environmental Archaeology (CEA) at TAMU
is an important exception to this characterization,
as it is reasonably well-integrated with TAMU’s
Department of Anthropology. While I can point to
many examples of excellent research projects that
have been conducted by university CRM organizations, it is also the case that some of the most
egregious examples of wasted archeologicat oppor2
tunities in Texas can be laid at the feet of organized
research units connected with public and private
universities. Thankfully, not many of these horror
stories are recent ones. The history of CRM archeology, on whatever level one wishes to discuss, is
replete with examples of the good, the bad, and the
downright ugly.
Part of the difficulty is the uncertainty of funding, which for any given organization can vary
widely from one year to the next. Almost all nongovernmental CRM positions are only as "permanent" as the funding. This means there is often a
high turnover rate, especially at the positions of
lower responsibility. Most private firms employ a
relatively small number of archeologists who hold
"permanent" staff positions. These serve as admin-

21

istrators, principal investigators, and project directors, and fill other positions of primary responsibility. Most field and laboratory workers are hired and
laid off seasonally as business comes and goes, and
they are seldom offered fringe benefits. Many
would-be archeologists, including some of the
brightest and most promising I have known, leave
archeology because of the uncertainties and difficulties of CRM employment. For those that survive
the initial years and are capable of, and interested
in, assuming greater levels of responsibility, the
employment picture improves, although it is still
subject to irregular cycles of feast and famine. Many
CRM archeologists migrate back and forth across
the country as regional economies and megaprojects boom and bust.
The final group, the avocational archeologists,
includes those from many walks of life who participate in archeology without earning a salary from it.
Texas has a long and justifi.ably proud tradition of
public participation in archeology, a tradition that
is exemplified by the history of the Texas Archeological Society (see Davis t979). The Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society was
founded in 1929 with the idea that anyone with an
abiding interest in past peoples, things, and fossils
could participate. Among its founding members
were the few professional archeologists of the day
and the somewhat more numerous serious
avocationals. As time went on the paleonto!ogists
went their separate way, and the members of the
Society agreed to adhere to a code of ethics that
said among other things that members would not
buy and sell artifacts and would not dig irresponsibly. As the profession of archeology grew so did
the TAS, as well as regional and loca! societies and
associations such as the STAA and the Travis
County Archeological Society, the two that I belong to. It is interesting to note that the TAS and the
regional and loca! societies have only partially overlapping memberships; more people, it seems, will
participate in regional and local societies than in
the statewide society.
Initially, most avocational archeologists do not
have any formal education in archeology. They usually gain field experience and training by participating in field schools and digs sponsored by societies,
and by working on volunteer projects in the field
and laboratory. Many go on to take college courses
in archeology and to participate in university field
schools and research projects. In the earlier years of

22

Texas Archeological Society

Texas archeology it was common for professional
archeologists to invite avocational archeologists to
participate in digs. Unfortunately, because of the
growing professionalization of archeology and, in
part, because of liability laws and other restrictions
placed on archeological organizations by governmental and private sponsors, this practice is generally uncommon today. In fact, some CRM
archeologists complain when a competing CRM firm
uses volunteers in lieu of paid help, out of a belief
that the practice confers an unfair competitive advantage. This situation is one of many highly regrettable aspects of compliance archeology.
Avocational archeologists present the discipline with much enthusiasm and varying levels of
archeological expertise. Some of the very best excavators that ! have been privileged to dig with
have been avocational archeologists. For instance,
E. Thomas Miller of Kerrville, Texas, is retired and
has gone on to make archeo!ogy a part-time occupation and serious avocation. Tom worked with me
at the Panther Springs Creek and Hinojosa sites,
and on the Higgins Experiment, and is an active
member of the STAA and TAS. As I write this, the
archeological grapevine reports that, while participating in the fall 1995 STAA field school, Tom has
excavated the first complete Angostura point found
at the deeply-stratified Richard Beene site in southern Bexar County. Knowing the man, I am certain
that he carefully exposed the artifact in place and
documented his find as skillfully as any professional archeologist. Tom is one of many avocational
archeologists of the first water.
Avocationals often bring-to archeo!ogy skills
and specialized knowledge that most archeologists
do not have. For instance, Donald Lewis of San
Antonio, a retired research chemist, has taught at
UTSA and made many contributions to South Texas
archeology, as well as to the field of archeometry,
the application of hard science methods to
archeological problems (e.g., Lewis 1978). Lewis
has trained several students, such as Jeff Huebner,
who have gone on to put archeometric techniques
to good use in Texas archeology (e.g., Huebner
1991). Pam Wheat, formerly of Houston, was a
school teacher who melded her profession with her
avocational interest in archeology to great effect
(e.g., Wheat and Wharton 1990). Pam is currently
the educational coordinator for the Crow Canyon
Archeological Center in Colorado. Many other
avocationals develop specialized skills out of their

interest in archeology, although I’ll cite only three.
The late R. King Harris of Dallas was a world
authority on glass trade beads (e.g., Harris and
Harris 1967). Jay C. Blaine of Dallas has become
an expert in early historic weaponry and metal
artifact conservation (e.g., Blaine 1993). Bill
McClure of Houston is an acknowledged expert
zooarcheologist, one who analyses animal bones
from archeological sites (e.g., McClure 1990).

INVESTIGATING THE
HUMAN PAST
Archaeo: from Greek arkhaio, meaning ancient
-Logy: from Greek logos, meaning word/speech/
discourse
Archaeology (Archeology): discourse about the
human past as informed by the systematic
study of ancient material remains.
What is it about archeology that the members
of the three groups of archeologists, academic,
CRM, and avocational, have in common? What is
the central goal of archeology? We will not find a
consensus answer from the scholarly discipline of
archeology, which over the past half century increasingly has become a field of inquiry that lacks
a unifying theoretical vision (Dunnell 1986). Today among the "hothouse theoretical elite" (Watson
1991:273), there are literally dozens of label-bearing brands of archeology: processualism, postprocessualism, Marxism, realism, feminism,
evolutionism, and so on (see Preucel 1991). While
each has its proponents, adherents, and critics, most
academic archeologists tread the abstract waters
without wholly subscribing to any one theoretical
pathway. And as Watson (1991:272) points out,
"beyond the brightly lit arena of theory in North
America, there are thousands of people doing archaeology every day who do not participate in the
debates or even follow them very closely." She
sees the very large CRM group as "almost an archaeological proletariat" who do "most of [the] field
and laboratory work carried out in this country."
Like many members of the "dirt" archeology
proletariat, I see the nature and aims of archeology
in more concrete terms. To me, archeology is about
trying to understand what it means to be the only
ape (member of the superfamily Hominoidea) that
can reach in his pocket, pull out the key to a Toyota,

Black ~ (Texas) Archeology 1995

and drive to the store for a bunch of bananas. Put
differently, the archeologist’s fascination with the
human past is part of mankind’s never ending efforts to understand the nature and history of our
own species, Homo sapiens sapiens, "doubly-wise
man." We archeologists study the material remains
of the human past, a past that is dimly and not-sodimly reflected by ancient things, artifacts and site
deposits: ancient remains that, when carefully and
cleverly studied, can reveal something of mankind’s
past, which is to say something of our present and
future selves as well. To me, archeology is both
history and science; by using the diverse methods
and tools of both the historian and the scientist, we
can help tell the unfolding narrative of humankind’ s
unique history on earth as well as help identify and
explain the processes and mechanisms by which
our species and its cultures have evolved since our
distant ancestors began to use tools some two to
three million years ago.
Like most, I chose to become an archeologist
because it seemed fascinating and fun. While in the
field as an archeologist, I have the opportunity to
sweat and shiver, ache and chaff, swat and stumble,
and otherwise savor the pleasures and pains of working with my hands in the dirt searching for ancient
things connected to the human past. The thrill of
archeological discovery is a powerful shared human experience. When a remarkable artifact, for
instance a Guadalupe gouge (Brown t985), comes
back from the past to make itself known to us in the
present, the feeling of connectedness is hard to
shake. As my hand grasps the curiously shaped
object and pulls it to my eyes, my mind’s eye flashes
with the realization that this very artifact was last
held by another human in this very place some
5500 years ago, a veritable warp in the time-space
continuum. And naturally, my second impulse is to
holler out to my field companions of the moment:
"come look at this." We gather around trying to
find a name for it, a time for it, an action for it. We
want to understand who made this thing, what was
it used for, how it looked in life, where was it
created, when was it left behind, and why was it
abandoned. We try to imagine the faces of its maker
and her (his?) companions. We recognize larger
patterns that this thing fits and fits not; what do
these patterns mean? What was life in the past like?
Why was it that earlier humans came to this very
spot? These questions, and the discoveries that bring
them to mind, are the timeless and universal es-

23

sence and excitement of archeology. Yet, definitive
answers can be exceedingly difficult to come by
and we archeologists often become dissatisfied with
those that we do propose.
Throughout the 20th century, archeologists
have come to realize that the human past is infinitely more complex and less accessible than was
previously imagined. The Tales that Dead Men Tell
through the "father of Texas archeology," James E.
Pearce, in 1935 seem quaint and narrow-minded
today. Similarly, site reports written in archeology’s
recent youth often seem painfully naive as the archeologist of the day reads with what she/he regards as a more sophisticated understanding of the
nature of the archeological record. The past is a
distant place inhabited by people we can never meet,
whose tongues are forever silent, whose thoughts
we can never directly fathom, and whose mundane
habits remain quite a challenge to comprehend. Today the materials remains of the human past are
static, lifeless things; the past will never exist again
and cannot possibly be recreated (Binford 1986).
We archeologists study the archeological record
and create present day understandings of the past.
Yet, despite the abundant evidence of our inevitable failings as interpreters, we continue to gain
understandings of the human past. In doing so, we
are coming to appreciate a bit more about what it
means to be the members of the only species with
pockets containing car keys.
The material record of mankind’s past is
entombed skin-deep within the ever-changing face
of the planet Earth. To develop improved understandings of our unwritten cultural past, we
archeologists must also study the earth’s natural
history. Archeology is inescapably linked to the
earth and natural sciences, geology, geography,
biology, botany, zoology, and so forth. Those who
study the archeological record must also tread some
of the same intellectual and methodological turf as
certain of the social sciences and humanities,
including sociocultural anthropology, history,
architecture, art history, linguistics, sociology,
psychology, and even philosophy, among others.
Archeologists look to these many interrelated
disciplines to borrow ideas, methods, and knowledge; occasionally we reciprocate.
To be an archeologist, then, is to be engaged
in an ongoing discussion about the human and
natural past as informed by the systematic study of
ancient material remains and many other avenues

24

Texas Archeological Society

of learning. This discourse is potentially carried on
at many levels with many other humans. For each
of us there is first the internal dialogue; trying to
convince yourself that some observation is of potential relevance for understanding the human past.
Outwardly, we communicate our understandings
and questions by the written and spoken word, as
well as by images, that find expression in excavation records, informal discussions, site reports,
journal articles, presentations at archeological
meetings, visits to public schools, public lectures,
and, increasingly, through the electronic media.
Today, our audience can be as narrow as our immediate colleagues, or as wide as interest in the
human past and our own skills as communicators
will allow.
In communicating what we think about the
past we archeologists hope to strike a cord in
another’s mind, for unless we can provoke response
we have failed to communicate. The main lure of
the discipline for the serious archeologist lies not in
the discovery of some great or perfect thing, but in
the intellectual and emotional interaction that follows. We attempt to learn about the human past so
that we can share our discoveries, our ideas, our
words, with each other and, perhaps, with a few of
those who will follow. Archeology is creative human interaction or it is nothing. As detectivistichistorians we try to weave the bits and clues into
narrative accounts of the behaviors, events, and
relations of human prehistory. As scientists, we try
to link the patterns we detect in the archeological
record to convincing explanations of the long-term
processes of cultural transformation. Archeologists
create ideas based on our preconceived notions tempered with our systematic observations about ancient remains, so that informed dialogue about the
human past and about the human present can thrive
among present and future humans.
At the heart of the archeologist’s responsibility
is the ethical principle that we share what we learn.
To do this, one’s field data must be inventoried and
organized coherently in the process of analyzing
one’s findings and writing down an honest
(methodological warts and all) and adequate
accounting of what one did and found. Once these
steps are properly done and the materials turned
over to a proper curation facility, then any
archeological researcher wishing to use the data or
examine the collections will be able to do so toward
whatever research goals they might have.

Unfortunately, the process of analysis and reporting
is often long delayed, sometimes for good reason.
A regrettable (and all too common) cost of
delay between field work and publication is that
often the latter never happens and the artifacts,
records, and other random data languish in messy
boxes. Untold hundreds of boxes have been dumped
at TARL and other repositories, places where the
tiny, overworked records and curation staffs never
have time to properly sort out most of the messes.
Every ethical archeo!ogist fully intends to publish
the backlog of reports and sites that often accrue
during a career, but being opportunistic, we often
take on much more than we can successfully bring
to publication. Yet we know we have the
responsibility, so we maintain the illusion that some
day we will make things right. All the while, the
data we collected is sitting, often in an incoherent
and unusable condition, sometimes hidden and
forgotten. This problem is even worse among
unethical archeologists and organizations that do
not even intend to carry through with their
obligations to finish projects and properly curate
data and collections. A better solution, in my
opinion, would be to take the interim step of
properly preparing a coherent data set and brief
accounting of what was done, as well as properly
curating the materials. This step done, the data and
artifacts would be available for other researchers to
access. If the original researcher found time to
publish the information, so much the better, but if
not, the primary ethical responsibility (to make one’s
data accessible) has been accomplished.
I think that the failure to publish one’s research
also points to a very harmful misunderstanding held
by many about archeology: the perception that a
single correct interpretation of any artifact, feature,
or site can (or should) exist. No interesting idea or
understanding about the human past is complete or
beyond dispute and improvement, no matter what
the credentials of its author. We do not dig up facts,
we dig up things and groups of things about which,
potentially, a great many observations and
explanations can be advanced, many different
questions posed, and many stories told. Ultimately,
most published archeological explanations are either
ignored or are shown to be flawed or otherwise
incomplete. While some explanations are ignored
because they are set forth in obscure sources or
because they are not understood, most simply fail
to capture the reader’s mind as an interesting notion.

Black-- (Texas) Archeology 1995

(A cynic might also add that many fine ideas are
ignored simply because few archeologists actually
bother to read the CRM reports lining their shelves.)
Our best interpretations are carefully structured
arguments that account for as many of the relevant
facts and observations as we can muster, given our
preconceptions at the time. Since we are constantly
enlarging the written archeological record,
continually finding ways to apply new (or borrowed)
analytical techniques, and even occasionally able
to come up with improved explanatory frameworks,
most interpretations are destined to be revisited.
That so little about the human past can be
definitively known is, depending on one’s
perspective, either the greatest frustration about
archeology or its greatest opportunity.
Perhaps it is the frustration with the uncertainties of archeological inquiry that causes many of us
to cling to previously expressed notions so tightly
that we close our minds to new ideas. Sometimes
we become so afraid of being wrong that we are
unwilling (or unable) to commit our ideas and our
data to the printed word. Maybe it is just a lack of
imagination? Whatever the motive, archeologists
often mimic and recycle prevailing notions as if
reiteration strengthens veracity. In my view, the
idea that ’what is written must be right’ is absurd,
especially in a revisionistic field like archeology.
Archeological interpretations and presentations
should live for their moment. I see the most successful archeological idea as one that inspires others to challenge it and, in so doing, push
archeological understanding to the next level or in
a new direction. Similarly, the successful presentation of archeological data provides reliable information that others find useful or stimulating. Truly
unsuccessful archeological ideas and data presentations are not those that fai! to provide the end all
and be all; they are the ones that are ignored.

(TEXAS) ARCHEOLOGY
The political entity we call Texas (from the
Caddo word taysha, meaning friend) has existed
for !ess than two centuries, a blink in humankind’s
past. Most of the boundaries of the oddly-shaped
28th state are completely meaningless in the context of the past. The straight lines that separate
Texas from other states are transparently artificial.
Our rivers have been effective cultural barriers but

25

for brief moments of their existence. Only the Gulf
of Mexico served as a natural barrier, and even it
seems to have been penetrated by water-borne visitors from Mesoamerica and Mississippian America
long before Alvar Nffiez Cabeza de Vaca washed
up on Galveston Island in 1528.
The landforms, plants, and animals that make up
Texas are aspects of geographic patterns that dwarf
the "everything is bigger" state. The oak and juniper
savanna in the central part of the state form the tale
end of vast forests that stretch eastward for thousands
of miles as well as the tail end of easterly critters like
the pine vole and the swamp rabbit. Likewise the
grassy prairies that meet their salty demise on the
beaches of South Texas can be followed for an even
greater distance to the north. And the parched, thorny
evergreen woodlands and brushlands of southwest
Texas can be tracked southward for hundreds of
miles up, down, and over the parched and rocky
Sierra Madre of northern Mexico. And so on.
The wider natural landscape provided the stage
upon which the dramas of the human past played
themselves out. The Native American cultures that
left their dim and unmistakable marks upon the
stage we call Texas often can be traced far beyond
the confines of our provincial state. Paleoindian
hunters carried distinctive spear tips and knives
made from Texas Panhandle (Alibates) flint hundreds of miles northward, following the migrations
of the Pleistocene beasts to and fro across the inland grassy sea. Archaic plant gatherers and deer
hunters performed hallucinogen-induced shamanistic rituals and depicted these on the walls of
rockshelters on both sides of the Rio Grande. The
dryland farming Mogollon villagers of the Hueco
Bolson shared culture and bloodlines with their relatives further west, and turquoise, pottery, and ideas
with Chichimecs far to the south. The forest farming ancient Caddo participated in far-flung interaction spheres which moved cultigens, cult items, and
social ideals back and forth across the Red River.
These examples are evoked to drive home the point
that modern political bounds of Texas need not
confine the minds of its archeologists.
The impressive archeological record of ancient
and not-so-ancient Texas exists in two great bodies
of potential and realized information, in-the-ground
and on-the-shelf. The buried archeological record
includes all that remains in context of the 54,000
officially recorded sites, as well as the hundreds of
thousands of other localities bearing cultural

26

Texas Archeological Society

remains that have not yet been added to the list. All
of us know that with each passing day this
archeological record suffers depredation and
attrition as the human (and natural) remodeling of
the planet continues apace. A relentlessly expanding
human population begets more concrete and less
unaltered terrain. More and more people find the
lure of ancient human artifacts irresistible. And who
can blame them?
Serious archeologists have as our credo that
things from the past are important and interesting
because of their informational content. While most
of us will certainly pause to appreciate the beauty
and craftsmanship of a well made dart point or
pottery vessel, we recognize that without good provenience (where something comes from) and lull
context (the circumstances within which something
occurs), artifacts lose most of their archeological
meaning. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that we
archeo!ogists often condemn pothunters and relic
collectors who seek things for things sake.
We who call ourselves archeologists need to
realize that we do not have an exclusive right to
study or possess archeological remains. As much
as we might desire control, the fact is that many
people other than archeologists are interested in the
past and purposefully (and not-so-purposefully) go
about finding artifacts. Landowners and their guests
ordinarily have every right under current Texas law
to do what they please with artifacts and entire sites
found on private property. In the near future, both
archeologists and collectors will probably have less
say-so regarding the ownership of certain archeological remains. For many Native Americans, whose
direct and not-so-direct ancestors created much of
the in-the-ground archeological record in Texas (as
elsewhere in North America), the ownership and
disposition of human remains, grave goods, and
other cultural items represents civil and political
rights issues.
Under the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), federal
agencies and all museums and repositories that receive federal funds must create inventories of all
Native American human remains and associated
funerary objects. Currently, these institutions are in
the process of providing inventories to the appropriate "culturally-affiliated" tribes, after which
time the tribes can demand the return of human
remains and associated grave goods. There are
many circumstances where tribal groups have de-

monstrable and direct cultural links to the bones of
their ancestors; in these cases, few conscientious
archeologists would deny their rights to demand
repatriation. However, political and bureaucratic
decisions already have been made that will almost
certainly result in the reburial of much more than
the bones and grave goods that can reasonably be
linked to specific tribes. Prehistoric burials and
grave goods that cannot be confidently attributed
to the direct ancestors of any modern tribe are being assigned to designated tribal groups. For instance, in Texas this could conceivably result in all
unmarked burials from the Southern Plains being
assigned either to the Comanches or one of the
Apache groups. Ironically, archeological repositories soon may be turning over the last direct remains of the Late Prehistoric Southern Plains
peoples (and their likely Archaic ancestors) to the
descendants of the very peoples who drove them
from their homeland.
I suspect that many may not be aware that this
process is already well underway here in Texas. In
most of the museums and other repositories like
TARL, NAGPRA inventories (accounting for and
assessing the cultural affiliation of all human remains and grave goods) are nearing completion.
Repatriations already have begun. For instance, in
the Federal Register issued on Monday, August 14,
1995 (60(156):41898-41899), the National Park
Service posted a "Notice of Inventory Completion"
in compliance with NAGPRA involving human remains recovered from five sites in Bell County,
from within or near Fort Hood. This brief notice
also summarizes actions already taken since 1991
by Jack Jackson, staff archeologist at Fort Hood
whose expertise is primarily in the realm of historic
archeology (e.g., Jackson 1986). Jackson appears
to be operating on his own as his actions did not
follow the federal government’s stated NAGPRA
policy. Among other things, the policy specifies
that formal notice of intent to repatriate will appear
prior to an action, not after-the-fact. Far worse from
my perspective is the way alleged tribal affiliations
were justified.
As stated in the notice, Jackson repatriated the
bones of 48 individuals vandalized from Javalina
Shelter to the Comanches. The determination of the
affiliated tribal group was based on the "abnormal
number of juvenile remains, suggesting a historical
disease epidemic" and "evidence of access to obsidian." A single obsidian flake was found in pothunter’s

Black ~ (Texas) Archeology 1995

backdirt (along with most of the bones), and may or
may not have been interred with the burials. It does
not take much archeological knowledge to realize
that these constitute precariously thin grounds for
linking the bones to the Comanche (or any other
modem group). Obsidian artifacts, although generally rare, are known from Paleoindian times onward
in the prehistoric archeologica! record in Texas (see
Hester 1991). Apparently, Jackson did not employ
the routine archeological method of obtaining radiocarbon dates from the archeological deposits containing the bones or directly from a small sample of
the bones, to find out if indeed these remains could
plausibly be those of the Comanche.
The notice says that on another occasion, Jackson turned over human remains from three other
sites to the Tonkawa of Oklahoma because they
were recovered from sites "occupied by peoples of
the Toyah and Austin Foci, acknowledged as ancestral to the Tonkawa Tribe." The knowledgeable
reader will know that this assertion flies in the face
of recent archeological and historical thinking and
abundant contrary evidence (see Johnson 1994:271281; Newcomb 1993:26-29; Newcomb and
Campbell 1982; Ricklis 1992). The Tonkawa were
latecomers to Texas who did not arrive until the
17th century, and could not possibly have been
responsible for the vast majority of the archeological manifestations known as the Austin and Toyah
foci or phases (cf. Jelks 1962; Prewitt 1981, 1985).
I consider it extremely unlikely that the bones
from Fort Hood that were returned to the Comanche
and Tonkawa were, in fact, those of their ancestors.
Sadly, the hasty and, in my opinion, ill-considered
actions in these cases will probably be used to establish legal precedent. Within a very few years
(months?), it is likely that human remains, grave
goods, and possibly even obsidian flakes and other
artifacts from the Waco area wil! be turned over to
the Comanche, Tonkawa, and other tribes based on
equally dubious evidence of ancestral connection. I
doubt that knowledgeable archeological researchers will be allowed any say in the matter.
If NAGPRA and the Archeological Resources
Protection Act of 1979, an oddly-written law which
contains sweeping provisions that partially belie its
apparent benign intent, are any indication, the federal government will continue to attempt to exert
greater control over archeological remains in Texas,
as elsewhere. Although there are indications that
some Native American groups, such as the Caddo,

27

appreciate the information that can be gained from
responsible archeological research (Carter 1995:1019), the archeological community can expect years
of turmoil during which archeological repositories
will lose significant portions of their collections.
While some tribes may elect to maintain their own
curatorial facilities, most grave goods will probably be reinterred along with the human remains. I
predict that future generations of archeological researchers will wonder why the archeologists of the
20th century were so slow to acknowledge and to
take into consideration Native American interests.
Future Texas archeologists will also wonder why
the archeological community did not take a strong
stance to oppose repatriation to inappropriate
groups, and why more analyses were not done before archeological collections were repatriated. Our
answers will seem hollow.
My view is that, in principle, the human past
belongs to all humankind. Since ultimately all living humans are genetically related to one another,
often much less distantly than most realize, on some
level we can all claim past remains as part of our
cultural heritage. Human remains from whatever
time period or cultural affiliation should be treated
with care and dignity. When our archeological work
intrudes on the human remains and sacred places
that are historically linked to specific living peoples
(i.e, lineal descendants), archeologists should take
into consideration their wishes. However, the idea
that all present-day Americans with Native blood
should determine the fate of all prehistoric remains
in North America is as preposterous as the notion
that I, Stephen Louis Black, as an individual of
Anglo-Saxon descent, should have a say so concerning what might be dug up on the grounds of
Buckingham Palace, much less what is excavated
in the Caucasus Mountains. Cultural heritage has
many competing interests, and we archeologists
should make sure that the right to investigate the
archeological record scientifically is not dealt away
by politicians, bureaucrats, lawyers, and our own
politically correct colleagues.
We North American archeologists need to realize that we must accord extraordinary respect and
sensitivity to Native American peoples and groups,
out of appreciation for the prehistoric archeological
record, which is the historical record of Native
American life. We must also acknowledge that
among earlier and present generations of archeologists there are many who have shown little respect

28

Texas Archeological Society

for living Native Americans. These realizations and
acknowledgments are not, however, grounds for
accepting without question any statement or claim
by a person who identifies himself as a Native
American. Last year, I listened respectfully while
an older Hispanic man from San Antonio who considers himself a Coahuiltecan intently described how
his ancestors made stone tools by trickling hot water onto flint rocks. I said nothing, but I recognized
his explanation as a bit of popular folklore that has
no basis in reality. Perhaps he has a trace of
Coahuiltecan blood coursing through his veins, but
Coahuilteco-speaking cultures have long since gone
to ground. Is tribal identity acquired by biological
ancestry or through the generation to generation
sharing of history, place, language, and custom?
Should newly formed groups such as "The
Coahuiltecan Nation" be given control of the archeological collections they are now coming forth
to claim? What happens when more than one group
of reborn "Coahuittecans" emerge? These issues
will be revisited many times in the next few years
as bones and grave goods are pulled in many directions, and as more and more urban Texans acknowledge and celebrate their Native American ancestors
(England !995).
We archeologists must also acknowledge that
Native Americans, casual and serious collectors,
and other members of society have understandable
and often legitimate interests in the past, even in
cases where these competing interests are antithetical to the goals of archeology. I advocate this position, not out of any desire whatsoever to encourage
collecting, site destruction, and wholesale repatriation, but simply because I think it foolish to deny
reality. Rather than react to the many challenges to
the in-the-ground and on-the-shelf archeological
record with condemnation, condescension, and denial, we must make better use of our most effective
tools: education, negotiated science-based compromise, and the dissemination of what we have learned
from the archeological record.
The on-the-shelf archeological record is the
sum total of the archeological data that has been
salvaged from the ground and preserved for posterity. This data exists as site notes, photographs, maps,
drawings, data bases, manuscripts, and published
reports, much of it stored at a relatively small number of permanent curation facilities like the one
where I work. The things (artifacts) themselves, are
not, to my way of thinking, archeological data, per

se. This is because the actual items have little meaning until and unless meaningful observations are
made about them. A meaningful observation might
be as simple as a basic description, but without
such a record the artifacts might as well not exist.
Without provenience and proper archeological documentation, the artifacts collected by the archeologist are just plain old things that have comparatively
little to say about the past.
All archeological pathways share at least one
common set of needs: to establish when, where,
and how ancient human traces came to rest in the
places we call sites. The universal need for establishing context is critical to all but the artifact idolaters among us, and even they would like to hang a
time and place on their goodies now and again.
This means that all archeologists (and even nonarcheologists interested in relics of the past) share a
common need. The contextual pieces that allow
each archeological puzzle-solver to gain an understanding of how his/her site or artifact fits into the
human past are virtually meaningless in and of
themselves. In archeological research, as in the assembly of a jigsaw puzzle or a detective’s chain of
evidence, each fitted piece (say an archeological
deposit linked to a time period) opens a larger picture. The chances of finding the fit(s) for any particular piece are proportional to the number of
well-fitted pieces. In other words, the more that is
known about the archeological record, the more
likely it is that any single site or deposit or artifact
can be linked to another, and wider cultural patterns can be discerned. Let’s take a concrete example involving the two archeological
manifestations I mentioned earlier, the Austin and
Toyah foci.
In 1959 and 1960, the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project (as TARL was then known) undertook the excavation of the Kyle Rockshelter in
what is now Whitney Reservoir, about 35 miles
northeast of Waco. Members of the Dallas Archeological Society (many of whom were TAS members as well) assisted in the work. Edward B. Jelks,
then a professional salvage archeologist (see Jelks’
Foreword, this volume), directed the excavations
and wrote a fine report (Jelks 1962) which many
subsequent archeological researchers, including
me, have found very useful. The study’s main contribution was to begin to flesh out the definition of
that portion of the archeological record in the central part of the state that dates to the latter part of

Black n (Texas) Archeology 1995

the prehistoric sequence, now known to date from
about A.D. 800 to A.D. 1500, or perhaps a bit later.
Jelks found that the shelter’s earlier cultural deposits formed during what was called the Austin focus
(with Scallorn arrow points as its main marker) and
that these deposits were overlain by those attributed to the Toyah focus (with Perdiz points). In
doing so, he succeeded in finally putting to rest J.
Charles Kelly’s long-lingering notion that Scallorn
and Perdiz arrow points were contemporaneous,
and showed that their periods of use of the Kyle
rockshelter were characterized by different artifact
assemblages and peculiar human behaviors.
However, lacking adequate comparative data,
Jelks could not fully evaluate his findings. For instance, when he assembled what would be one of
the first published sets of radiocarbon dates in
Texas archeology, he mistakenly concluded that
the Austin and Toyah loci were separated in time
by a gap of several hundred years. Subsequent researchers have shown that the makers of Perdiz
points (i.e., Toyah peoples) followed directly on
the heels of those who made Scallorn points (i.e.,
Austin peoples) and probably even partially overlapped in time (Prewitt 1985). Today, as archeologists are continuing to try to understand the timing
and nature of the cultural relationships among Late
Prehistoric cultural manifestations, the archeological data excavated and presented by Jelks over 30
years ago are used time and again as comparative
points of reference (Black 1986:249; Johnson
1994:246-248; Prewitt 1981:82-84; Quigg and
Peck 1995:176; Ricklis and Collins 1994:298-304).
While it is likely that Toyah culture was in part
shared by peoples who were present in earliest historic times, such as the Mayeye (Newcomb t993)
and perhaps the Sanans (Johnson and Campbell
1992), these were the very groups that were displaced by the mounted aboriginal raiders who
moved into the region in the 17th and 18th centuries (see Newcomb t993).
As this example shows, the written archeological record of prehistoric Texas is a dynamic
and constantly changing set of documents in which
archeologists attempt to record and preserve the
results of our research. As research opportunities
arise, we go back to the field and sample more of
the in-the-ground record, giving rise to new, improved, but never perfect understandings as archeologists fulfill their ethica! obligation to publish
and make available the results of their research.

29

Academic scholars have traditionally published in
peer-reviewed academic journals, such as American Antiquity, in scholarly volumes published by
university presses, and in regional journals such as
the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society.
Effective scholarly publication is a time-consuming, expensive task because the intended result is a
polished, carefully reasoned, tightly edited, wellillustrated, well-produced volume.
CRM archeology generally moves at a much
faster pace and, unfortunately, generally has much
lower standards. In Texas, the growth of CRM archeology has led to an overwhelming quantity of
printed information: letter reports, survey reports,
testing reports, and mitigation volumes. While there
are fine studies among these, the average report is
hastily produced, minimally edited, poorly illustrated, and crudely printed. Further, there is much
duplication of effort, because CRM archeologists
feel obligated to provide the background and basic
explanations that the sponsors of research often do
not have (but rarely care to learn). The cost of
producing badly done reports is one of the major
ones associated with CRM archeology. The problem is well known to anyone who has actually
looked at the stacks and stacks of reports that CRM
archeology generates. Aside the relatively small,
but crucially important, fraction of substantive reports, most CRM reports are, in my opinion, remarkably free of meaningful content. In fact, most
ordinary reports look and sound alike, because they
basically contain the same things written in the
same dull, technical style. If the common claim is
true, that we CRM archeologists write only for
each other, much of our published record would
seem to suggest that we hold each other in exceptionally low regard.
I often find more interesting reading in the
journals produced by the most dedicated of the
volunteers who comprise the regional and local societies. There, one finds timely articles by professional, avocational, and student archeologists on a
range of archeological and historical subjects. The
one I regularly receive and enjoy is La Tierra, the
quarterly journal of the STAA, now in its 22nd
year. Even !onger traditions are maintained by the
E1 Paso Archaeological Society (The Artifact) and
the Dallas Archeological Society (The Record). Although the quality of articles and the production of
the regional journals is highly varied, much good
data are reported nowhere else.

HOW TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY
1995 WORKS
To explain more clearly how archeology works
today, I need to discuss the roles of key groups of
"players," some of whom have already been mentioned. The many individuals and organizations that
play a role in current Texas archeology have diverse interests and involvements, roles which are
sometimes adversarial to one another. Some players do archeology, while others sponsor, regulate,
manage, legislate, consume, preserve, encourage,
allow, protect, destroy, or do their best to avoid
archeology. This sketch is of necessity incomplete
and perhaps not entirely objective, as I am sometimes in the thick of things. Like most attempts to
fit people or archeological things into neat piles,
there are gaps and overlaps. I shall begin by taking
a closer look at how each of three groups of North
American archeologists--academic, CRM, and
avocational--are involved in Texas archeology.
There are academic archeologists at all of the
major public and private universities in the state
and some of the smaller colleges as well. Many
academics have little direct involvement in Texas
archeology, but may have considerable impact
through their scholarly contributions. For example,
the man many consider the most influential modern
archeological thinker in North America, Lewis D.
Binford, is presently on the faculty of SMU. Binford
was the acknowledged intellectual leader of the
New Archeology, a reactionary movement in North
American archeology in the 1960s and 1970s. The
New Archeologists, most of whom were among the
younger academic archeologists of the day,
wrenched the prevailing research agenda of North
American archeologists away from its traditional
concentration on chronology and culture history
and toward what they considered more explicitly
scientific approaches and a primary concern with
cultural processes (see Dunnell 1986; Trigger 1989).
While Texas archeology remained on the sidelines
during much of the upheaval and debate, its research goals and methods have changed somewhat
in response to wider intellectual trends, as many of
the articles in this volume attest.
Resident academic archeologists also contribute to Texas archeology by training undergraduate
and graduate students and by participating directly
in archeological research. With the exception of a
small number of mostly Old World archeologists

who are connected with Classics, Art History, and
Middle Eastern Studies, academic archeologists in
Texas are faculty members in anthropology (or
sometimes geography) departments. They teach
courses on many aspects of archeology and often
involve graduate students (and sometimes undergraduates) in their research projects. This is directly reflected in the comparatively small number
of Ph.D. dissertations that have been written on
Texas archeology. Most advanced students are encouraged to work toward their mentor’s goals in
other areas of the world. From the present perspective, this is highly regrettable, because doctoral research often contributes very importantly to the
archeology of any region. Interesting, among the
small number of examples that can be cited of such
energizing studies, about as many were accomplished by Texas archeologists who left the state to
study elsewhere (e.g., Weir 1976; Creel 1986) as
were done locally (e.g., Shafer 1973; Ricklis 1990).
Most of the academics who actively participate
in Texas archeology periodically teach summer field
schools. In any given summer there may be as
many as 4-5 field schools going on in different
places in Texas. For instance, in late June of each
of the last four years I have enjoyed visiting the
Texas Tech University (TTU) field school near San
Saba in Central Texas that is directed by my longtime friend and colleague, Grant Hall. As is typical
of university field schools, most of the students are
undergraduates getting their first exposure to handson archeology. While relatively few will make a
career of archeology, many will remember the
experience fondly and may participate in archeology
again on an avocational basis. I know of a half
dozen of Grant’s former field school students who
are employed in CRM archeology in Texas and
elsewhere, as well as several who are now in
graduate school. As the students at the TTU field
school learn about the basics and logistics of survey
and test excavation, they contribute to long-term
regional research. Hall has identified the San Saba
area as one that, because of its concentration of
native pecan trees and permanent springs, would
have been an important resource area for Archaic
hunter-gatherers. Over the next several decades,
Hall hopes to continue working in the area (with
anyone who will join him) to gain the kind of indepth understanding of the cultural and natural
history of the region that can only come from
experience. As I see it, most archeological research

Black m (Texas) Archeology 1995

efforts in Texas would be more effective if they
were conceived and coordinated on a regional basis.
For me the most disheartening aspect of academic archeology in Texas is the present gulf between theoretical/methodological ideals and the
realities of CRM archeology. Most academic programs continue to prepare more and more students
to become academic archeologists despite the fact
that only a small fraction of those graduating with
advanced degrees will obtain academic positions
(see Schuldenrein 1995). In the real world of archeological employment, the vast majority of all
the jobs are CRM-related. To succeed in the CRM
world, archeological students need training and exposure to such aspects of modern archeology as
situational ethics, CRM law and the regulatory process, government- and private-sector employment
opportunities, and even business administration. To
my knowledge, the only academic program in Texas
archeology that regularly offers formal courses in
CRM or "applied" archeology is TAMU. Other
anthropology departments, such as the largest one
in the state at UT-Austin, continue to act as though
an academically-oriented education will best serve
their students. While UT-Austin and other universities have organized research branches (such as
TARL) that provide some students with employment opportunities and firsthand experience in CRM
archeology, far less integration exists than should
and could (Blanton 1995).
I find it fascinating and encouraging that so
many undergraduate and graduate students take an
interest in Texas archeology. While many of these
students are young, a surprising number are older
people who have followed other paths through life
and have returned to school to pursue an interest in
the human past. They do not study, knowingly, to
prepare themselves to be management or business
types; they study to become archeo!ogical researchers. Longtime readers of the Bulletin and the regional journals have seen many examples of the
potential revealed by student research articles, but
must wonder what happens to all those whose names
never surface again. As they progress through the
educational system, students encounter many of the
same promises and problems that I describe in this
article and they, too, wonder if they will find employment that satisfies both their need for a steady
income and their desire to contribute to meaningful
research. While some find that they have no real
aptitude for painstaking research, many become dis-

31

heartened because of the mismatch they encounter
between academic promise and CRM reality, and
they leave archeology never to return. However,
others persist. Some go on to make significant contributions to archeology in Texas or elsewhere, but
others seem to bow their once-promising heads to
what I see as the darker side of CRM reality and
become part of the problem.
I have made the basic distinctions among private-sector, university-affiliated, and government
archeologists. About a third of the 300-400 CRM
archeologists in the state belong to the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA), a professional organization that meets twice a year to discuss shared
issues. The CTA also provides a listing of archeological contractors. The May 1995 list reveals that
in the private-sector there are at least 40 firms that
periodically employ archeologists in Texas, although at least a third of these are essentially oneperson operations. The priv.ate firms include those
like Prewitt and Associates, Inc. of Austin and
Moore Archaeological Consulting of Houston that
focus exclusively on archeology, as well as larger
consulting companies like Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. of Austin, Sandra Hicks and Company of Austin, and Geo-Marine, Inc. of Plano that
provide a variety of environmental and cultural services. Among the multi-service companies, there
are still larger consulting firms like TRC Mariah
Associates Inc. and SWCA Environmental Consultants that have offices in Austin, but are headquartered in other states. Further, consulting firms
in adjacent states and elsewhere in the country sometimes do archeological work in Texas. The private
archeological consulting business is fluid and difficult to track as companies expand and contract in
step with business.
I have mentioned the larger university-affiliated research organizations, TARL at UT-Austin,
CEA at TAMU, and CAR at UTSA. There are
smaller contract programs at the University of Texas
at E1 Paso, Stephen F. Austin University
(Nacogdoches), and UNT (Denton). The major federal agencies that have archeo!ogists in Texas include the Corps of Engineers with offices in Ft.
Worth and Galveston, the U.S. Forest Service, and
the U.S. Army at Ft. Hood and Ft. Bliss. Other
federal archeologists in the state work for the U.S.
Air Force and the National Park Service (NPS). At
the state level, the largest archeological employer
is the Texas Historical Commission, followed by

32

Texas Archeological Society

the Texas Department of Transportation, the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department, the Texas Water
Development Board, the Adjutant General’s Office
(Army National Guard of Texas) and, finally, the
Texas General Land Office (GLO) who has a single
archeologist, Bob Skiles. Bob’s career is an interesting example of how CRM archeologists often
move from one group to the next. He got his start
with university contract outfits at SMU and UNT,
then worked for the U.S. Forest Service in East
Texas, and now works for the GLO in Austin.
Among the CRM archeologists and organizations that actually do compliance fieldwork, I see a
basic distinction between those which I will call
"reactive" and others who may be said to be
"proactive" with regard to archeological research.
While there are many shades of gray, the end members, at least, are accurately described by my caricatures. Proactive archeologists attempt to carry
out compliance work in a conscientious way, generally doing average or above-average work with
whatever archeological task falls their way. When
given a choice, these individuals generally do the
archeologically ethical thing to the best of their
training and ability, within the constraints of the
situation. In contrast, reactive "archeologists" seem
to care about archeology only when it is particularly exciting or falls within their favored area of
the state, or when forced to. Many are just lazy, but
some are downright dishonest. They cut corners
whenever possible. Ironically, reactive archeologists sometimes piously claim the high road of archeological righteousness and justify their
professional irresponsibility on the nature of the
archeological record. Only "good" sites deserve
good work, they say (thereby acknowledging that
they ordinarily do bad or cursory work). Unfortunately, despite not having the respect of most of
their colleagues, a fair number of these individuals
end up in positions of authority and responsibility,
often undermining or thwarting the efforts of the
proactive archeologists who work under them. Since
the principals of any organization usually determine the nature of its contributions to, and attitudes
about, archeological research, one can ordinarily
distinguish between reactive and proactive organizations. I will use this admittedly overdrawn
proactive vs. reactive distinction to help illustrate
certain tensions in Texas archeology.
CRM archeology is driven by federal and state
laws, regulations, and rules. These include laws

such as the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 and the Antiquities Code of Texas (written in
1969 and amended several times since, most
recently in 1995), as well as regulations such 36
CFR 60, Department of the Interior Regulations
concerning the National Register of Historic Places.
Leaving aside the many technicalities, the obvious
intent of this extensive body of laws and regulations
is to offer some protection to cultural resources
(such as archeological sites) by insuring that when
federal- or state-funded, permitted, or approved
land-altering actions take place, steps are taken to
avoid or mitigate the impact of these actions on the
resources. All Federally permitted, funded, or
approved "undertakings" (land-altering actions)
must follow what is known as the Section 106
process (of the National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966). Examples of such undertakings include
the state’s building of interstate and state highways
with federal moneys, the building of recreational
facilities on NPS land at Lake Amistad, and the
issuing of discharge permits by the Environmental
Protection Agency for lignite mines in East Texas.
The Section 106 process involves the determination
of whether affected archeological sites are eligible
for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (i.e., are important), and, if so, what actions
should be taken to protect the sites or salvage a
reasonable part of the information that they contain.
The complex federal process is administered and
enforced through the State Historic Preservation
Office, the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The THC also administers and enforces the
Antiquities Code, which requires permits (under
certain conditions) when land-altering actions are
carried out on property that is owned or controlled
by a state agency or any of the state’s political
subdivision (counties, municipalities, etc.). While
there are important differences, the federal and state
processes are broadly equivalent.
Like most areas of government, what began as
a well-intentioned and straightforward aim--to protect archeological sites and preserve the information that they contain--has become a complex,
time-consuming, and very expensive process. Simplified, it works more or less as follows. The archeological regulators at the THC and among
various federal agencies attempt to encourage, cajole, and coerce "sponsors," governmental agencies, political subdivisions, and private concerns
who need governmental approval, to determine if

Black ~ (Texas) Archeology 1995

they have responsibilities under these laws and if
their actions will have an adverse impact on "culturally or scientifically-significant" archeological
sites. Sponsors do this by hiring or employing CRM
archeologists to survey a given property and evaluate the encountered sites, usually by probing or
testing with hand and mechanized methods. CRM
archeologists usually find sites for the simple reason that prehistoric and historic sites abound in the
state. While the proactive archeologists generally
find more sites and answer "yes" or "maybe" more
often to the question of site significance than reactive archeologists, initial work rarely suffices when
the area to be affected is sizable and/or situated
along permanent water. This is because little is
actually known about the hundreds of thousands of
archeological sites present in Texas; hence most
sites have some theoretical (or actual) potential to
yield scientifically useful information. A "yes" or
"maybe" answer means, of course, that more investigation time (which means money) is needed to
further test to determine if a site is important enough
to be excavated. If it is, and the site cannot be
avoided or protected from the action, even more
time/money will be needed.
CRM archeology, like purely academic
research, is costly for many reasons, such as the
not-unreasonable desire for profitability among
private contractors. Most reasons, however, have to
do with the changing nature of archeological
research and the cost of life in late 20th century
America. Sticking to the former, modern
archeological research is expensive for two reasons,
time and technicality. The process of intelligently
and thoroughly investigating informative
archeological sites is extremely time consuming
(and in professional life, time equals money). While
there are ways to speed things up, to focus more
narrowly, and to extrapolate from smallish samples,
thorough field archeology requires a great deal of
human effort. While earlier generations of Texas
archeologists dug fast and saved only the "goodies"
(intact or well-shaped artifacts), today we recognize
that the answers to much of what we want to know
about aboriginal life can only corne from recording
the crucial observations that document the
patterning of artifacts, features, and natural deposits
before the archeological context is shoveled away.
We also understand that often we must closely
scrutinize the minutiae, the fragments as well as the
good stuff, the tiny charred pieces of animal bone

33

and plants, the very grains of the soil which envelop
archeological deposits. Increasingly important and
informative are technical studies such as the
identification of animal bones and plants,
radiocarbon dating, pollen and phytolith (plant
crystals) identification, soil chemistry, petrographic
examination of pottery thin sections, and forensic
studies of human bone. These specialized studies
are part and parcel of modem archeological research
and the developing subfields such as archeometry,
zooarcheology, paleobotany, and geomorphology.
Many millions of dollars are spent each year
in Texas as part of CRM work. No one really
knows how much is spent because the funds are
dispersed by many different public and private organizations. My educated guess is that at least 10
million dollars will be expended in 1995 on contracted CRM archeological research in Texas.
Since this does not include the cost of work done
by the 60-70 archeologists who are on government
payrolls, add another roughly 2 million for federal
and state archeologists headquartered in Texas.
Conservatively, then, I estimate that at least 12
million dollars will be spent on archeology in
Texas during 1995, although the true figure could
be twice that. The reader might find this figure
astonishing and might wonder what is being
learned for all this money; so do I. (Many of the
data summarized and presented in the other articles
in this Bulletin were gathered during CRM work,
and provide a partial answer.)
The sponsoring organizations who distribute
these monies include state and federal agencies,
regional and local utilities, land developers, and
other private businesses. In Texas, the federal agencies who directly sponsor research include all those
previously listed as employers of archeologists, as
well as the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department
of Energy, and various others. Certain state organizations, such as the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) sponsor or administer archeology
on behalf of federa! agencies, in this case the Federal Highways Administration, as well as for the
state. In addition to TxDOT, the sponsoring agencies at the state level include the Texas Water Development Board and the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department. As mentioned, some of these federal
and state agencies have archeologists on their staffs
who carry out or contract out archeological research
work. Beyond the strictly governmental realm, regional quasi-governmental agencies such as the

34

Texas Archeological Society

LCRA sponsor archeology, as do many municipalities and towns. The other major group of sponsors
are private land developers, such as mining companies, who contract archeological services as part of
the federal and state environmental review and permitting process.
Few of these sponsoring agencies and organizations are motivated to become seriously involved
in archeology because of a primary concern with
the impact their activities might have on archeological sites and other types of cultural resources.
They sponsor research and contract archeological
services because federal and state regulations require them to do so and because archeologists working for federal and state agencies force them to
meet these requirements. In Texas, most of this
responsibility falls to (or involves) the Texas Historical Commission, a small state agency that has
the unenviable burden of attempting to balance the
many conflicting interests involved in archeology.
The daily workings of the THC are in the hands
of its Executive Director, Curtis D. Tunnell (himself
an archeologist), who runs the agency on behalf of
18 commissioners who are private citizens (usually
politically connected) appointed for 3-year terms by
the Governor. Rose Trevifio, historic preservationist, TAS member, and avocational from Laredo,
Texas, is the only archeologist who has ever served
as a commissioner. Fortunately, due to recent changes
mandated by the 74th Legislature, in the future, one
of the commissioners will always be a professional
archeologist. Also new is a seven-person Antiquities Advisory Board (which includes five archeologists) which will advise the Commissioners on
archeological matters related to the Antiquities Code.
The Commission meets four times a year, and rules
on certain preservation issues such as the occasionally hotly contested designation of State Archeological Landmarks (a protective designation that is
somewhat confusingly applied more often to historic buildings than archeological sites). However,
the day-to-day decisions are made by agency staff,
who have a mission to encourage the preservation
and protection of historically important cultural resources, including buildings and other types of historical properties, as well as archeological sites.
Two THC departments deal with archeology, the
Department of Antiquities Protection (DAP), headed
currently by Dr. James Bruseth, and the Office of
the State Archeologist (OSA), headed by Pat
Mercado-Allinger, the acting State Archeologist.

The Office of the State Archeologist is funded
primarily by the state, and is charged with working with private landowners and citizens to protect
and preserve archeological sites on private land.
They havea staff of four archeologists (including
Mercado-Allinger) and several support people, including a publications editor. OSA does some research, particularly in rescue situations when
private funds can be raised, but focuses its efforts
on education and on working with avocational archeologists. Since 1984, one of the most important
projects of the OSA has been its Archeological
Stewardship Network, composed of about 50
avocational archeologists across the state who
serve as the eyes and ears of the THC. Among their
duties, the stewards try to monitor land-altering
activities in their corners of the state, and to alert
OSA and DAP when archeological opportunities
and problems come to their attention. Stewards
record sites, salvage important finds and document
collections, and generally try to stay on top of the
archeology in their local areas, tasks that the small
Austin-based staff of the THC cannot possibly do.
Along with the TAS and CTA, the OSA also cosponsors Texas Archeology Awareness week (now
month) in April of each year. This highly successful program provides archeological speakers and
literature to public groups and schools around the
state. The OSA also publishes well-produced archeological reports and educational brochures.
While OSA gets drawn into various archeologically
related conflicts, these generally pale by comparison to those facing DAP.
The Department of Antiquities Protection is
charged with making sure that the federal Section
106 process is followed by federal agencies and
project sponsors, as well as overseeing the
provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas that
deal with archeological sites. Because DAP
administers, on behalf of the state of Texas, the
Section 106 review process, it receives a
substantial portion of its funding from federal
sources. DAP has a regular staff of eight
archeologists (including Bruseth) and three support
people. In addition, four other staff members (two
of whom are also archeologists) are working on the
Texas Historic Sites Atlas Project, a sizable,
federally funded project to create a statewide
electronic database of historic and prehistoric site
information. The regular staff archeologists spend
most of their time reviewing the small mountains

Black ~ (Texas) Archeology 1995
of paperwork that flow through DAP week-in,
week-out. Their task is to sort through the notices
of federal, state, and local actions to find the
relatively small number of activities that may
adversely affect (impact) archeological sites.
Project reviewing is a difficult and largely
thankless task even in the best of times, a process
that virtually the entire CRM community in Texas
depends on for its livelihood. In spite of this, or
perhaps because of it, DAP is the lightning rod for
criticism and controversy concerning archeological
problems in the state of Texas.
The Department of Antiquities Protection lies
at the nexus of sponsors, CRM archeologists, Texas
politicians, and federal regulatory agencies, groups
which often have competing and conflicting interests and priorities. Understandably, most of the
sponsors want to be done with archeology as
quickly and as cheaply as possible so they can accomplish their larger construction goal. However,
relatively few sponsors understand how CRM archeology works. Sometimes out of ignorance,
sponsors at times contract with the more reactive
CRM organizations and archeologists, who care
more about serving their business client, the sponsor, than they do about doing good archeology.
While keeping the sponsors happy and doing good
archeology need not be an either-or situation, it all
too often is. With profit as their primary motive,
reactive CRM firms bid as high as they can (but as
low as needed to get the work), and then do as little
archeology as they think they can get away with.
Naturally, DAP should deal with reactive CRM
archeologists with a heavy hand, double-checking
their claims and often demanding that a more thorough job be done. Yet, what would be judged
"shoddy" or substandard work by most competent
archeologists regularly goes unchallenged because
DAP reviewers do not have the resources, the
motivation, and/or the mandate to investigate every suspect case. However, sometimes the reported
work is blatantly inadequate or misrepresented
(such as one archeologist’s claim that he had
single-handedly dug, screened, and recorded some
90-100 shovel tests in a single day!). On other
occasions, an OSA Steward or other archeologist
b!ows the whistle on problems by alerting DAP to
the existence of additional sites within the affected
area or to the potential significance of sites that a
CRM firm (or governmental agency) has judged
insignificant.

35

When shoddy work is called into question, the
reactionary archeologist always blames the need
for more work on DAP, sometimes causing the
sponsor to complain to DAP. In extreme cases,
usually involving large tracts and costly archeological investigations, sponsors have been known
to call friendly politicians who themselves do not
understand archeology. "We have already spent
nearly a million dollars" they might say (omitting
mention that the costs often reflect the incompetence and greed of their archeological contractor
more than the amount of archeology done), "we
just can’t afford any more." The sponsors or their
politicians demand explanation and reprieve from
DAP (or from the THC’s Executive Director). In
Section 106 cases, the THC truthfully responds that
they are merely insuring that federal laws and regulations relating to archeology are met by project
sponsors and federal agencies. Still, the THC is
vulnerable to political pressure because its state
funding and the Antiquities Code is in the powerful
and capricious hands of the Texas Legislature.
While many such calls can be handled by calm
explanations of the process, the political pressure
results, more often than DAP admits, in a decision
to "back off’’ from its demands that reactive CRM
archeologists do a competent job. Regrettably, it is
the archeological record that suffers, not the unethical archeologists.
With most proactive CRM archeologists, DAP
does not need a heavy hand because they know that
conscientious archeologists make good-faith archeological evaluations and attempt to do an adequate
amount of work. Even so, differences can arise
between the sponsor, the CRM contractor, and DAP
as archeological significance, costs, and timing, are
weighed and debated. Project sponsors often find
the costs of archeology more than what they had
initially budgeted (usually without benefit of consultation with archeologically knowledgeable individuals), especially when they delay archeological
decisions until late in the process. Zealous contractors are sometimes unwilling to do less than what
they see as the archeologically correct thing to do,
irrespective of costs and political realities. DAP
tries to steer a neutral road by seeming to side with
both, and often ends up making everybody unhappy
and suspicious. Further, in their usual attempt to be
impartial, DAP reviewers have been known to scrutinize proactive work more carefully than reactive
work (i.e., trivial problems are pointed out and small

36

Texas Archeological Society

decisions are questioned). Although such actions
and differences cause resentment and sometimes
delay, the proactive archeologists usually take their
complaints directly to DAP and ultimately achieve
some kind of workable compromise.
In sum, sponsors perceive themselves to be at
the mercy of archeologists, who always blame the
problems on DAP, who blame the federal agencies
and regulations. Few sponsors have the knowledge
of the CRM archeological world to be able to realize that a higher initial bid from a competent,
proactive firm may end up costing them less in the
long run, especially if they use the occasion to gain
the positive publicity that can be garnered by sponsoring important research. The reactive firms often
submit unrealistic initial bids, knowing that DAP
will force them to do more work, which they can
bill the client for, blaming added costs on DAP.
The proactive archeologists get upset when they
see DAP caving in to real and perceived political
pressures and letting reactive archeologists (their
competitors) get away with inadequate work. The
result is a vicious circle that, at times, has all sides
distrusting and resenting DAP.
Doubtlessly, many sponsors and CRM archeologists do not see the CRM world the way I do.
Having served on DAP’s 1992-1994 CRM Advisory Board, a small, diverse group of CRM and
avocational archeologists, i appreciate the extremely important and unavoidably difficult nature
of DAP’s role. On the balance, I think that DAP
usually does a commendable job. However, I do
not agree with the way political pressure is often
handled. As I perceive it, DAP makes
archeologically unfavorable deals and caves in to
perceived and real political pressure out of a belief
that this will stave off the powerful sponsors, business groups, and bought politicians who want to
see archeological laws and rules weakened (e.g.,
Ivanovich 1995). ! think that just the opposite happens: When the power players see that DAP will
bend to pressure, they are encouraged to lean even
more heavily. DAP claims that this behind-thescenes political bargaining saves the archeological
day by "keeping the preservation tools intact" (a
euphemism which apparently means "preserve the
bureaucracy at any cost"). I think the only right
thing for DAP to do is to address such matters
openly, and to consistently argue in favor of doing
what is best for the archeological record (i.e., to
protect the state’s antiquities).

The reader may find this seamy underside of
CRM archeology disturbing; so do I and so do most
conscientious professional archeologists. Many of
my colleagues feel powerless to do anything about
the situation and some fear, not without reason, that
speaking up might make their professional lives
more difficult. Others fear that if we draw attention
to our problems, we will provide ammunition for
archeology’s foes. I feel strongly that cleaning up
the CRM process is a responsibility that we cannot
postpone or conceal, although ! realize all too well
that the road to a better CRM tomorrow will not be
an easy one.
Let me now turn to the more pleasant task of
mentioning recent examples of some of the quality
research that CRM archeologists in Texas are producing before I discuss the roles of other players in
Texas archeology. By focusing attention on the
troubles of CRM archeology, I run the risk of making it seem as though nothing good ever happens.
This is far from the case, as demonstrated by four
recent studies that have provided outstanding data,
as well as stimulating ideas. The need for a large
water pipeline in Tom Green County brought about
the 1993 discovery and partial excavation of an
unusually well-stratified and preserved Toyah campsite (Quigg and Peck 1995). This important report’s
major strengths are its data presentation and timely
publication. Many years earlier, the construction of
IH 10 in Kimble County occasioned the excavation
of an interestingly different Toyah campsite. After
long delay, the results were studied and a lively
comparative study was published in a volume that is
quite welt-produced by CRM standards (Johnson
1994). At about the same time far to the south in
Live Oak County, the building of IH 37 was scheduled to obliterate a large prehistoric cemetery containing the bones and grave goods of Archaic peoples
who lived in the region some 2,500 years ago. Fortunately, TxDOT archeologists were able to carry
out a major excavation, and eventually the results
were analyzed and a fine report produced that is
jam-packed with very useful and well-presented data
(Taylor and Highley 1995). My final recent example is a project done on Galveston Island, where
a civic-minded developer funded the study of a
cemetery and campsite that dates to the latest prehistoric era and early historic period (Ricklis 1994).
This report is exemplary because of its data presentation and the skillful integration of archeological
and ethnohistorical data. These are but a few of

Black ~ (Texas) Archeology 1995
many examples that could be cited where CRM
monies result in the salvaging of important information in advance of land-altering activities.
Having taken Jack Jackson to task for how he
has handled reburial issues, it is only fair that I
acknowledge his contributions as a manager of cultural resources. Since the late 1980s, Jackson has
overseen the archeological resources at Fort Hood, a
huge expanse of land in Bell and Coryell counties
controlled by the U.S. Army. Jackson and his predecessor, Frederick Briuer, have managed the Army’s
efforts for almost 20 years to fulfill its obligations
under the National Historic Preservation Act. Work
by TAMU, TRC Mariah Associates, and now Prewitt
and Associates, has been aimed at inventorying and
evaluating the archeological record that the Army
manages. While this work has been time consuming
and costly, over 30 published studies have documented a huge research base of dated site deposits,
many of which are not immediately threatened. In
the 21st century, this data base may prove very
important to archeologists as a conserved, welldocumented archeological record that may be made
available for focused research efforts.
The many avocational archeologists in the state
contribute in diverse ways, many of which I have
mentioned. The regional and local societies regularly undertake survey and excavation work, sometimes assisting professional archeologists. Although
avocational archeologists usually do not receive
much recognition, the Society for American
Archaeology’s Crabtree Award for lifelong
avocational contributions has been awarded to three
individuals who have worked in Texas since the
award was established in 1985. In that year, the
first recipient was the late Clarence Webb, who
was recognized for his contributions to Caddo archeology in Texas and Louisiana. In !989, the late
J. B. Sollberger (formerly of Dallas) was acknowledged for his experimental lithic research. Most
recently in 1994, Leland W. Patterson of Houston
was recognized for his prolific and wide-ranging
contributions to archeology.
I have cited other examples of particularly
dedicated avocationals who specialize, like many
professionals do, on some topic or area and, over
time, become respected experts. Other avocationals
work with relic collectors and landowners to
document sites and artifact collections. For instance,
longtime STAA and TAS member and Steward C.
K. Chandler of San Antonio has labored tirelessly

37

for many years to record sites and bring important
collections and finds to printed light (e.g., Chandler
1995). Some professional archeologists are opposed
to having anything to do with poorly provenienced
and improperly excavated artifacts, reasoning that
by cooperating, archeologists will lend an air of
legitimacy to collecting and looting. While I agree
in cases that involve antiquities buying, selling, or
trading, I believe that there is much more to be
gained by documenting the collections of recreational collectors than by chastising these people.
Most collectors are ordinary citizens motivated by
a genuine, if uninformed, interest in the human
past. I know of many examples where such
collectors have become involved in archeology
through avocational societies, and then have
contributed to archeology. In fact, many of the
leading professional archeologists in this state were
first introduced to archeology through collecting. It
is usually through contact with avocational and
professional archeologists that collectors become
more informed and responsible about archeology.
The final two players, private landowners and
the general public, are potentially the most important players of all. Since most land in Texas is held
in private hands, and since the state’s laws allow
most private landowners to do what they please
with archeological sites, landowners hold one of
the most important keys to archeology’s future. I
have found that most ranchers, farmers, and other
landowners (including some developers), have a
genuine interest in the natural and cultural history
of their land. Some of archeology’s most tireless
and effective workers have come from the ranks of
rural landowners; historian and avocational archeologist Kay D. Hindes of Charlotte, springs immediately to mind (e.g., Hindes et al. 1995) as does
Wharton County rancher and avocational Joe D.
Hudgins (e.g., Hudgins 1993). When archeologists
earn landowners’ respect, we often find them willing and interested in protecting important archeo!ogical sites. However, developing such
relationships takes a commitment on the part of the
archeologist to respect the rights and wishes of the
landowner. Obtaining permission to enter private
land, leaving gates as you find them, crossing fences
through gates, obeying landowner rules, and keeping one’s promises are essential behaviors for the
responsible archeologist.
Recently, though, I have become troubled by
the more reactionary forces involved in the

38

Texas Archeological Society

property rights movement, as I have encountered
several landowners who have refused me access,
when only a few years before they were willing and
cooperative. "Why," I ask, "did I break my word?"
"No, it’s just that this ’environmental’ thing has me
upset," one banker in West Central Texas told me.
Apparently he had been persuaded that unnamed
"environmentalists" would use any excuse
(including archeology) to obtain access to private
land for untoward purposes. I think such scare
tactics are ludicrous, but the banker was quite
sincere and unmoved by my lengthy letter
explaining exactly what I wanted to do (a minor
reconnaissance while collecting ochre and chert
samples for comparative analyses). I mention this
in hopes that archeologists will be aware of the
heightened sensitivity of landowners and will keep
archeological issues separate from environmental
issues and property rights. We archeologists
already have our hands full in educating
landowners and other members of the public about
the value and long-term potential of important
archeological sites.
Archeology’s biggest potential audience is the
general public. I cannot count the times that, when
introduced to a stranger as an archeologist, I have
heard "I always wanted to be an archeologist" or
"archeology is so-o-o fascinating." Average people
are interested in archeology because they understand, often more clearly than archeologists, that
we all have a share in the human past. They want to
know many of the same things that archeologists
want to know, although most are uninterested in
technicalities and the painstaking research process.
They want to know who did what in the past and
why. Unthinkingly, we archeologists often reply in
our normal dry, jargon-laden, and overly qualified
archeo-speak. As my wife put it, after sitting through
what I had thought was a very public-oriented, wellillustrated talk, "most people are not as interested
in [burned] rocks as you are." I believe that to
insure a bright future for (Texas) archeology, we
must concentrate on building and maintaining "audience share." We need to give back to the public
that directly and indirectly supports archeological
work more of what they want to learn (Lintz 1994).
Through education and increased public participation, I am convinced that more people will want to
hear about the fascinating implications of the lowly
burned rock and other sorts of mundane, but potentially revealing archeological evidence.

(TEXAS) ARCHEOLOGY IN
THE 21ST CENTURY?
While earlier generations of archeologists in
Texas and elsewhere in North America shared a
world view of how archeology was to be done and
what archeology was after (Dunnell 1986), 21st
century archeologists will continue to diversify. Interest will proliferate in different: periods of the
past, cultures, theoretical perspectives, methods, research specialties, and motivations for doing archeology. This diversification will continue simply
because of the growing numbers of people who live
in the state and take part in archeological research,
because there are so many ways that the past can be
explored, and because there are many uses to which
the past can be put. As we increasingly recognize
the complexities of the past, we realize that there is
no one true path to knowledge, but many pathways
which can and should be explored.
It is equally apparent that certain unproductive
trails should be avoided. An obvious example is the
one that led archeologists to excavate Caddo cemetery sites as recently as two years ago in Northeast
Texas without taking into consideration the views
of the modern Caddo people. Other unproductive
pathways are commingled with productive ones in
the tangled mess of laws, bureaucracy, "research"
by low-bid, and good archeology that is subsumed
under the shingle of CRM. Where is (Texas) archeology to go?
The shape of the archeological future in Texas
will be closely tied to social, technological, and
political changes. We are witnessing a period during
which politicians and the public are struggling with
social issues and the nature of government
involvement. Those who are taking aim at the
enormous federal government and its seemingly
voracious spending have gone after historic
preservation funding and the budgets of many
agencies (such as the Corps of Engineers) that play
important roles in Texas archeology. So far, the
cuts in most of the areas that affect CRM funding
seem to be relatively minor, but these decreases
may very well constitute the first wave of many to
come, I suspect. Perhaps this is because I see up
close plenty of examples of needless waste, wellintentioned but hopelessly cumbersome regulations,
and misdirected effort in the federal and state CRM
process. However, all things are relative, and the
magnitude of archeological spending pales by

Black ~ (Texas) Archeology 1995
comparison with that of many other areas of
government. Some of my colleagues believe that
the federal and state CRM processes are too firmly
ingrained to be done away with, and point to
continued public support for historic preservation.
The problems of CRM archeology are certainly not unique to Texas (or to archeology) and
are currently being chronicled and debated elsewhere in the country (e.g., Pape 1995). While I
think it is increasingly clear that the whole process
needs to be reconsidered, few participant observers
see a safe path to achieving meaningful reform. In
cynical moments, I am convinced that major improvements will not come about until the regulations are gutted and the present system collapses.
However it happens, catastrophically or gradually,
CRM archeology must change. Too much power
and control is concentrated in the hands of too few
well-intentioned, but entrenched bureaucrats in Austin and Washington. Those of us on the contractor
side of the CRM coin, proactive and reactive alike,
have vested interests in that our own needs and
goals often take priority over objective assessments
of archeological significance. To keep our organizations and careers afloat, we play the system to
our own advantage, justifying our own excesses
more easily than we do those of our competitors.
Texas archeologists of good heart and thick
hide need to push the state’s CRM agencies toward
profound reform. Archeological bureaucrats, like
academics, tend to stay put for too long, becoming
inured to shortcomings, and well-practiced at rationalizing the status quo. Experience needs to be
tempered with the idealism borne by fresh faces
who do not yet conceive most problems as intractable. To effectively manage the cultural resources
of our vast and geographically diverse state, we
need to move toward regionally based systems of
planning, review, and research where the important
decisions are shared by a broader spectrum of
archeologically knowledgeable individuals. Our
vested interests need to be openly disclosed and
balanced against objective measures of research significance, need, and value. And we CRM archeologists need to consistently serve the needs of the
archeological record at least as well as we do those
of our sponsors, and ourselves.
During the CRM boom of recent decades, the
traditional bonds among the relatively few professional archeologists and the relatively many
avocational archeologists have weakened. Today

39

many of the professional archeologists in the state
do their work with comparatively little interaction
with avocationals. This trend is one that I think is
particularly harmful, though perhaps understandable. Archeology as a business operates at a hurried
pace that often does not allow time for developing
and cultivating relationships between paid and unpaid archeologist. The increasingly technical nature of archeological research and writing is also to
blame as fewer and fewer people find archeological
reports interesting and readable.
However, from my perspective it will be absolutely crucial to the survival of archeology in the
21st century that professional and avocational archeology be reunited. Here is why. The archeological record is disappearing at an ever-increasing pace.
There will never be enough money and time for
professionals to salvage or investigate the disappearing record fully. The efforts, skills, and enthusiasm of avocational archeologists can help increase
the odds that any single site or deposit is at least
partially sampled before it is gone. Besides, the fun
of archeology is the process of discovery, and sharing that discovery with people who care. What is
the point of spending great chunks of archeological
research time and effort in our all-too-short lives to
learn things that nobody gives a tinker’s spring
about? For me, more good archeological data and
more good archeological participants means more
fun, more stimulation, and more meaningful interaction about the archeological record.
How do we achieve this reunification, or rather,
improved integration? I think the lion’ s share of the
responsibility here falls to the professional archeologists. Too many paid archeologists do not participate in the societies, Archeology Awareness
Week, or any after-hours activities in archeology.
Professionals need to realize that we are part of a
wider archeological community and that cooperation with avocational archeologists and the
archeologically interested public is part of our responsibilities as members of the discipline. All CRM
organizations and agencies should encourage staff
members to participate in the events of archeo!ogical societies and organizations as part of their professional obligation to share knowledge.
Texas archeology of the next century will operate in an increasingly different technological and
social environment from what we have now. On the
social side, more and more people will live in the
state and they will have more and more diverse

40

Texas Archeological Society

interests, if less and less free time. Thus, there will
be an ever larger pool of possible participants and
consumers of Texas archeology. Clever archeologists among us will harness this potential by devising imaginative ways of involving avocationals and
non-archeologists more meaningfully in the potentially creative human interaction that is archeology.
I think the primary means for involving more people
in archeology will come from the rapidly changing
technological world.
It is estimated that by the end of 1995, 40
percent of American households will have personal
computers. I would guess that this percentage is
much higher among most professional archeologists in Texas and probably among avocationals as
well. I bought my first one in 1982, and have relied
on computers ever since, primarily as writing tools,
but increasingly as the means of organizing, collecting, and analyzing data, as well as a communication device. From my house in Austin I can
participate nightly in debates and exchanges with
archeologists across North America and the world.
Information, trivial and substantive, travels almost
instantaneously. For instance, last July I sent a message to A1 Wesolowsky, former Texan archeologist
who is the managing editor of the Journal for Field
Archaeology at Boston University, telling him of
the news that underwater archeologist J. Barto
Arnold of the THC had apparently discovered one
of La Salle’s ships in Matagorda Bay. Not surprisingly, A1 had already seen digital rumor of this asyet-unannounced discovery, and was keen to know
details. The world is truly becoming a global village for those of us with access to technology.
In the early 2 t st century, the computer will be
integrated with the television and telephone to fundamentally change communication and information
exchange. While late 20th century archeologists
have been generally slow to harness the technology, computers offer us the very means we have
long lacked to effectively manage, store, compare,
and exchange the astonishingly voluminous amount
of archeological data that has been pried from the
in-the-ground archeological record. Resistance to
doing this has come from the cost of techno!ogy
and the technological phobias that some archeologists seem to have. Ironically, archeological tradition is sometimes seen as threatened by the very
thing, technological change, that archeologists often study. The considerable costs of adopting technology must be weighed against the considerable

cost of doing things by hand. Computers will not
replace archeologists; they are simply tools that,
when used effectively, will allow us to concentrate
more on the fun parts of archeology: investigation,
analysis, and communication. In the 21st century,
new generations of computer-literate archeologists
will be able to help transform and convert data
collected by traditional methods to the newer technologies. The information age will offer many challenges and opportunities to Texas archeologists.
Those interested in archeology in the 21 st century should, I think, take a keen interest in where
the professional archeological money goes and how
it is spent. Since most professional archeologists
are being paid directly or indirectly to serve the
public, to educate the public, to preserve cultural
resources for the public future, or to fulfill public
(governmental) regulations and responsibilities, the
public has the right to demand accountability and
participation. Taxpayers and citizens ultimately pay
for most of the archeology that is done in Texas as
elsewhere in this country. The archeologically motivated citizenry can and should demand accountability and participation.
What is being learned by public-sponsored
digs? Why are taxpayers paying millions of dollars
for what amounts to, in some cases, shoddy research and abysmal archeological records? Why
can’t taxpayers go to public libraries and find readable accounts of every major archeological research
project? Why can’t taxpayers see and even handle
the artifacts that are collected by public servants
and housed by public institutions? Why can’t they
visit digs on public lands and lend a hand? Why
aren’t the laws and regulations written to insure
that public moneys are wisely spent (in archeology)? Why don’t more local and regional museums
hire an archeologist? Why don’t state-funded universities train archeotogical students to do publicsponsored archeology? Ask and ask again.
I am encouraged by the positive steps currently being taken to keep building on the successes of the Archeological Stewards Network.
However, we other archeologists need to recognize
that such stewardship is within our power. That is,
each of us can and should serve as archeological
stewards by working locally to do what we can to
rescue the rapidly vanishing in-the-ground archeological record. We need to put greater emphasis on
what earlier generations called "salvage" archeology; it is hard to "manage" cultural resources that

Black ~ (Texas) Archeology 1995
are being destroyed at ever-faster rates. The crisis
of a disappearing archeological record is one that
every introductory text emphasizes and one that
every conscientious archeologist calls attention to
whenever opportunity presents itself, but I’ll make
it real and recent.
In Corps of Engineers lakes in Northeast Texas,
Caddo villages, graves, and houses are being relentlessly destroyed, day-in, day-out, by the actions
of winds and artificial waters and by the artifactseeking collectors and pothunters. Far to the south
and west the same is happening to the remains of
Coahuilteco speakers (and other ethnic groups who
passed without leaving their name): cemeteries,
camps, and rockshelters along both sides of the
Mexican border in Falcon and Amistad reservoirs.
Near E1 Paso, all-terrain vehicles wreck much havoc
and provide ready access to Mogollon villages,
houses, and graves, things that lay scarcely buried
beneath the shifting sands. In the Pandhandle, collectors with metal detectors are striping away the
meager traces of early Spanish visitors and potting
some of the few documented historic Indian village
locations. Meanwhile honest farmers pl0w through
the playas ringed with habitation traces dating back
to Clovis times, year by year.
As more and more people populate Texas and
the world at large, the traces of past humans are
progressively destroyed by intent, by accident, by
neglect, and by the passage of time. Here in Texas,
the buried archeological record is continuously and
rapidly dwindling, and it is our responsibility as
conscientious archeologists to act wherever and
whenever we can to rescue (a term preferred by the
British) what we can. Of course many of us are
doing just that, but we can do more if we would
coordinate and focus our actions more effectively.
In my view, one of the most important missions
any archeological society can aspire to is that of
rescue archeology. While there are countless sites,
features, and artifacts in need of rescue, we should,
I think, marshall our efforts where it can be best put
to use. For urban and suburban archeologists the
major battlefields should be on the edges of the
metropolis. As the cities relentlessly sprawl, it is in
those places that the largest number of sites are
threatened by construction and by the wave of
uncontrolled digging that accompanies the urban
expansion. The most recent session of the Texas
Legislature has provided a special incentive
(through a brokered deal of the sort I mentioned

41

earlier) by exempting municipalities from following
the Antiquities Code when their actions involve
less than 5 acres and no sites are known before
construction. Thus, by making sure that the cultural
resources within and around municipalities are
known and properly recorded, we can prevent undue
harm to the archeological record.
I conclude this article by sketching a vision of
a Texas archeology of the 21 st century, an idealistic blend of the best of what we have now and what
might and could be. As you read it, try not to think
about the reasons why such a Texas archeology can
never exist, or even the many difficult steps that
achieving such a vision would require. Instead, join
me in imagining (Texas) archeology as it could be
in the tomorrow of the next century. The sketch
touches on many elements that I think we, who are
sincerely and even passionately interested in archeological scholarship, research, and interaction,
should work to achieve. As I have tried to indicate
throughout this essay, there are already many encouraging recent examples of the kinds of positive
archeological effort and common-sense integration
that I seek. The seeds of a productive archeological
future for Texas are already sown, but our seedlings need coddling and protection from the tenaciously weedy and often harsh climate that is Texas
archeology in 1995. Doubtlessly, my fellow archeologists present and future will create a 21st century different from what I envision, but perhaps
some ideals will be shared and realized.

A Vision of (Texas) Archeology
of Tomorrow

For I dipt into the future, far as human eye
could see,
Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder
that would be;
Alfred, Lord Tennyson, 1842

Texas archeology could be a place where
academic, avocational, and CRM archeologists
work cooperatively: sharing mutual goals whenever
feasible, sharing ideas, data, and scholarly
arguments freely, and taking advantage of diverse
skills and interests by channeling opportunity
toward the peoples and organizations that can best
accomplish individual pieces of the archeological
pie. Academic and contract branches of a single

42

Texas Archeological Society

university would be effectively integrated, with
students and teachers moving back and forth from
classroom to apply method and theory hands-on.
University-based researchers and specialists would
also work with private compliance-oriented firms
that offered efficient, competent service tailored to
meet the needs of both sponsors and archeological
research. CRM archeologists would have a
professional guild whose members were sworn to
promote ethical, competent research.
CRM funds would be generated based on fair
appraisals of land-altering project impacts. These
moneys would be distributed according to research
and development priorities, as well as scientific
and educational potential. Regionally based funding and compliance approval boards made up of
rotating groups of regional experts (including CRM
researchers, avocationals and academics, as well as
archeologically-educated private citizens and government managers), would set reasonable standards,
research priorities, and effectively administer the
money. University-based archeologists and private
firms would compete to win contracts to carry out
specific archeolological rescue tasks and basic research, based on the quality of research designs,
innovation, and delivery efficiency. Professional
research organizations would be expected to accommodate capable avocational volunteers and the
interested public whenever possible.
Professional and avocational archeologists
would work within loosely organized research
groups to monitor and steward the archeological
resources of a region, and work cooperatively to
share in the process and results of archeological
interaction. They would also help channel and encourage citizen involvement through educational
programs, field and laboratory participation, archeological experiments, and public museums. Local
and regional museums would employ archeologists
that helped coordinate and focus avocational and
public participation. Community colleges would
offer courses and training in archeology to extend
that provided in the universities to a wider segment
of the citizenry. Landowners would receive recognition and tax incentives for protecting and preserving important archeological resources.
The Texas Archeological Society and its
regional and local counterparts would work with
professional research organizations to accomplish
long-term research. The annual field school would
be one component of a year-around commitment to

follow research through to completion. TAS
members, guided by professional principal
investigators, would participate in the planning of
research, the execution of field research (the field
school), laboratory processing, analyses, and
publications. The data generated from the Society’s
research efforts would be quickly made available
for all interested members to ponder and work with.
This would be accomplished through widelyavailable digital technologies, technologies that
would allow TAS members to communicate at any
time from any spot in the state, sharing ideas,
rumors, finds, and bad puns. The Society would
foster many new archeological activities. The annual
meeting would include sessions geared toward the
general public, hands-on work, and regional
problems, as well as conventional talks.
State and Federal agencies would coordinate
their planning and development programs with the
regional research groups and funding boards. Research would be scheduled to mutual advantage,
usually well in advance of land-altering activities.
Business and government would pay their fair share,
but would be assured that their monies were wisely
spent. The physical remains of our past would be
treated with respect and concern for both cultural
and scientific needs. When land-altered activities
and archeological investigations encountered human remains of any time or culture, these would be
handled according to protocols worked out by agreements negotiated in advance by living ethnic descendants, if such can be accurately traced, and
with scientific and cultural advisors.
Information about the basic archeological
record would be filed, stored, and retrieved
electronically from any location in the state (and
world), with proper safeguards for locationally and
personally sensitive information. Routine reports
of most investigations would appear only in
electronic form, retrievable from any home or office.
These would competently describe what was done
and what was found, and furnish an overview (and
locational guide) of properly archived and
safeguarded data. Much comparative research could
be done remotely by accessing data from regional
clearing houses and repositories. When necessary,
researchers would be able to examine artifacts,
ecofacts, and records first hand, by scheduling visits
with curation facilities jointly supported by
universities and government funds. Major research
efforts, general and technological syntheses, and

Black m (Texas) Archeology 1995
special studies would be published both
electronically and conventionally to high standards
of scholarship and production.
Technological advances would permit "virtual
digs," where excavations in remote areas of Texas,
such as the canyons of the Lower Pecos, would be
linked via satellite communication and the Internet
to the wider world. These interactive demonstration
projects would feature rotating teams of professional, student, and volunteer archeologists working together to close the loop between discovery
and dissemination of the archeological findings.
Specialists and analysts would attempt to stay current with the excavation, providing immediate
feedback to the excavators and to the watching
world. Links to schools would allow 7th grade
Texas history classes to follow the dig, ask questions, and actually examine and work with the archeological data. The project’s corporate sponsors
might fund a contest enabling school kids, who
come up with winning solutions to real archeological problems, to visit the dig first hand. Through
such virtual digs, Texas archeology could move to
the forefront of innovation and public participation
in the 21st century.
Blink, blink. Back to the Texas archeology of
1995, where darker professional moments send
nightmarishly pessimistic visions flickering through
my mind’s eye. The great promise and the grievous
problems compel me to see the end of this century
as a major turning point and a time for action.
Although certain changes in 21st century archeology will be automatic (and a consequence of social
change), the members of the Texas Archeological
Society and all other archeologists in the state will
have many opportunities to use our voices, talents,
and resources to help shape the archeological future. Whether and how we make use of these opportunities is up to each one of us. Think of
tomorrow, do it today.
