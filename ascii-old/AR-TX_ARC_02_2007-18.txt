ABSTRACT
AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological
survey of approximately 75 acres within the Hidden Cove Development
Tract during the middle of April, 2007. The proposed development tract is
on the Lake Lewisville shore west of The Colony in Denton County,
Texas. The purpose of the survey was to determine if cultural materials
were present and was done for Marine Quest Marina and Resort.
A records research did not reveal any historic or prehistoric cultural
resources in the study area; however, 10 archaeological sites were
recorded in the vicinity of the study area during an archaeological survey
of the proposed Lewisville Lake shoreline by the University of North
Texas. No archaeological resources were found and shovel-testing failed
to locate any buried cultural resources. Probably the absence of prehistoric
sites was due to the distance from perennial water and low biotic diversity.
The absence of historic sites is probably the fact that the land was farmed
in the past and the recorded historic sites were found further downslope.
Based on the field investigation, it is AR Consultant’s recommendation
that no further cultural resource investigations are warranted on this
property. The Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers
should be advised if buried cultural resources are uncovered during
construction, and, if found, construction should cease immediately in that
area until proper investigations can be carried out.

INTRODUCTION
During the middle of April, 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of approximately 75 acres of the Hidden Cove Development Tract
located within the old Hackberry Park in Denton County, Texas. The study area is located
north and south of the Hackberry Creek Park Road within the Hidden Cove Park and
north of Lake Lewisville’s shoreline (Figure 1). This archaeological survey was required
by the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The survey was
conducted for Marine Quest Marina and Resort.
The archaeological survey was conducted as part of the environmental review needed to
meet relevant federal legislative requirements. These include legislation such as the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593
“Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment” and Procedures for the
Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C.
The following report contains a brief description of the natural environment, the culture
history and then a review of previous investigations in the area. This is followed by the
research design and methodology. The description of the archaeologically surveyed tract
constitutes the major part of this report. Recommendations are contained in the final
chapter. A list of references cited concludes the report. This report was written in
accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (N.D.).

NATURAL SETTING
Denton County is located in North Central Texas. It is bisected by the sandy soil of the
Eastern Cross Timbers. The western portion of the county is covered by the black soil of
the Fort Worth Prairie and the eastern part consists of the rich, black soil of the Blackland
Prairie in which the study area lies. The county is drained by the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River and several major creeks (Odom 2003).
The underlying geology of the study area is mapped as the Upper Cretaceous-aged Eagle
Ford Formation which consists of shale which is overlain by Quaternary fluvatile terrace
deposits (Bureau of Economic Geology 1967). The soil association in which the study
area lies is the Branyon-Burleson-Heiden which consists of nearly level to moderately
steep upland clays (Ford and Pauls 1980:Sheet 34). Specific soils within the study area
consist of Altoga silty clay with 3 to 5 and 5 to 8 percent slopes, Branyon clay with 0 to 1
and 1 to 3 percent slopes and Heiden clay with 1 to 3 and 3 to 5 percent slopes (Ford and
Pauls 1980:Sheet 35). The subsoil for the Altoga series is listed as being 6 inches (15 cm)
below the ground surface (Ford and Pauls 1980:60) and is present on the highest
elevation of the study area. The rest of the soils are on the slopes and have C horizons at
least 4 feet beneath the ground surface.
The upland surface has been cleared of most trees and supports Bermuda and other
grasses that have been invaded by mesquites. The edge of the upland and the valley
support numerous young and old trees including bois d’arc, American elm, cedar elm,
hackberry, honey locust along with various weeds and masses of greenbriars. According
to various authors, including Lynott (1979), the prairie once supported a cover of tall
grasses and was inhabited by now absent herbivores including bison and antelope.
Certainly, deer inhabited the floodplain forests, but this environment is not present in the
survey area.
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring and Yates
(1997), Humphrey and Ferring (1994), and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations
based on different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on
Ferring’s investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating
periods of rapid alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier
conditions, Ferring has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr B.P. to the present]
was a wet period with moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000 to 1000
yr B.P. [A.D. 1-1000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol was
established on the stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and its
tributaries. This interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope
analysis. Brown (1998) offers a differing interpretation based on isotopic analyses of
mussel shells from a prehistoric site (41DL270) on Denton Creek. He concludes that the
period from 1500 to 2500 yr B.P. was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after the
environment was warmer and drier, but he points out that this interpretation may only be
applicable for the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

CULTURE HISTORY
The history and prehistory of this part of Denton County are summarized in several
reports prepared by the University of North Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990; Ferring and
Yates 1998). Prehistoric Native American settlement in Denton County began at least
10,000 years ago as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points (Crook
and Harris 1957) at the Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001).
Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff and other
Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region. The presence of exotic, i.e.,
non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled through a territory
where higher quality lithics were available or the people were involved in a system of
raw material trading. These early people hunted now-extinct large game, but probably
also foraged off the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000 to 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700-800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the counties but particularly along
the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods.
Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts found
on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making and using exotic cherts
for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics for
chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and
Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or
ridges that overlook the Elm Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have been
recorded in upland areas throughout the county. These sites appear to be Archaic in age,
but none have been thoroughly studied.
About A.D. 700 to 800, a major change is found in the artifacts and settlement patterning
of the prehistoric sites. This is attributed to the drying up of the smaller tributaries.
During this period, which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East
Texas appears as trade material along with the indigenous Nocona Plain pottery. It has
been suggested that farming may have been practiced. Arrowheads appear about this
same time and apparently the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tool kit.
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the north-central Texas area based on an absence of sites with trade
goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish or English traders (Skinner
1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and attempts to
factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational archaeologists
who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region (Peter, Cliff and Green
1996:2). There is very little evidence of historic era Native American occupation
anywhere in the region although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the
early 1800's.
The history of man's presence in North Central Texas continues with the first written
accounts by the French and Spanish explorers. There is tantalizing evidence to the south
in Dallas County of possible visits by Spanish explorers. Current research, however,

seems to indicate that Anglo settlers were the first non-Indians to visit the survey area.
Established European settlement in Denton County began before the mid-1800's with the
establishment of the Peter's Colony after Texas independence. These early settlers were
farmers who selected bottomland along the Elm Fork of the Trinity. The town of Little
Elm was established with a post office in 1845 (Bridges 1978). Commercial farming was
not important until after the Civil War, and the early settlers were essentially selfsufficient. Besides the plants and animals they grew, wild animals and plants were
commonly consumed. Denton became the county seat in 1856. By 1875, cotton, corn, and
wheat were the main cash crops. Up to half of these crops were grown by tenant farmers
who either paid rent to the land owner for their house, tools, and seed or by tenants who
gave the landowner a third of the grain and a quarter of the cotton or other cash crops. By
the turn of the century, all of the major communities had been established and some had
passed away.
Previous Investigations
Prior to the field survey, records were checked with Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeological Sites Atlas (2007). Historic maps, including the 1918 Soil Map of Denton
County (Carter and Beck 1918) and the R. King Harris’ map (1936) were also reviewed.
No historic farmsteads were shown on the maps and previous surveys had not recorded
any sites within the area of potential effect.
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007) no sites have been recorded in
the study area. However, the University of North Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:85-93)
did an archaeological survey of the shoreline of Lake Lewisville and recorded 10 sites
(41DN401 through 41DN411) surrounding the study area underneath the water of the
lake. The sites consist of the remnants of historic homesteads with associated trash
scatters that range in age from the late 1870s to the 1930s. Site 41DN411 is multicomponent and also contains a prehistoric lithic scatter and two manos.
AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2002) conducted an archaeological survey about
4 miles northwest of the study area of a proposed toll road that extended from Lake
Lewisville’s shore line to IH 35E but failed to discover any archaeological sites.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

Research Design
The purpose of the research design below is to insure that fieldwork will contribute to
better understanding of prehistoric and historic settlement in Denton County. Geographic
locations for sites found in Lebo and Brown’s (1990) research and Ferring and Yates
(1998) excavation of five sites in the Lake Lewisville area suggest that sites are found on
benches, their toes, and knolls. Usually the sites are close to permanent water courses.
The question then arises, “Are there sites located in these topographic features further
away from permanent water sources?” The presence of a historic site is possible based
upon the amount found in Lebo and Brown’s survey. The presence of only one
prehistoric site indicates that the potential for a prehistoric site may be low.
Methodology
In order to address these questions, the field personnel, with the aid of appropriate project
system design maps, USGS maps and Denton County soil information, conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the study area. The archaeologists walked
parallel transects spaced approximately 30 m apart. Notes on the vegetation, soil and
other relevant information were taken as were photographs.
The ground surface was carefully inspected even in areas where visibility was less than
thirty percent. Shovel tests were placed in locations with less than thirty percent ground
visibility as recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) in the Blackland
Prairie upland setting. Shovel tests were not dug in mechanically disturbed areas or where
the soil was visible. Due to the upland setting, shovel tests were excavated to
approximately 35 cm below the ground surface because cultural materials would deflate
onto the ground surface. The clay which could not be screened was broken manually and
visually inspected for cultural resources as were the pit walls.
The proposed development tract consists of approximately 75 acres. Of the 75 acres,
approximately 40 acres had been disturbed by the construction of RV parks, picnic tables,
cabins, parking lots and other features. The one shovel test per 2 acres was exceeded for
the approximately 35 undisturbed acres.

RESULTS
This portion of the report presents a description of the survey area, a discussion of the
survey and the conclusions based upon the survey and information from the surrounding
area. Due to the odd shape of the survey area, it has been broken into four sections, A
through D (Figure 4). Shovel tests are discussed generally in the text and shown on
Figures 5 and 6. The shovel test data are presented in Table 1.
The survey area
The terrain gently slopes to the north and south. The study area is heavily disturbed from
construction of roads, picnic tables, camping areas and cabins and related structures.
Numerous crayfish holes and armadillo holes as well as ant mounds were present. Trees
include mesquite, eastern red cedar, American elm, winged elm, hackberry and bois
d’arc. Understory vegetation includes johnson grass, coastal bermuda grass, saw
greenbriar, daisies, milkweed, yucca, poison ivy, poison oak, hog brush, catalpa and
native grasses and bushes. Ground visibility ranged from less than 5 to 80 percent.
Mowed trails that had eroded in places throughout the study area allowed for good
ground visibility. Eye-height visibility in the cleared areas was excellent and in the
grassland portion of the study area, but was only about 10 m in the deeply forested areas.
As previously mentioned, only about 35 acres of the suryey area were undisturbed. The
typical vegetation in the forested area is shown in Figure 2 and the typical disturbed area
is shown in Figure 3.

The survey
Section A
This section was almost all disturbed due to the construction of park facilities as shown
on Figure 6. Three shovel tests (1 through 3) were excavated in undisturbed terrain south
of Hackberry Creek Park Road in the eastern portion of the section. The shovel tests
uncovered 35, 37 and 36 cm of culturally sterile clay, respectively. Shovel tests 4 and 5
were excavated in the center of the oval in the western portion of the section and
uncovered 34 and 36 cm of culturally sterile clay. No cultural materials older than 50
years were seen on the ground surface or were uncovered in the shovel tests or along the
shoreline.
Section B
Section B consists of a relatively undisturbed area and the small area around a water
tower. A RV/Boat storage area is present that does not show up on the Google Earth map
(Figure 6). Interestingly, despite the amount of vegetation, ground visibility was at least
30 percent. Six shovel tests (6 through 11) were excavated and uncovered 39, 35, 37, 34
36 and 38 cm of culturally sterile clay. No shovel tests were excavated around the tower
area due to disturbance and good ground visibility. No mowed trails were present in this
portion of the study area. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the
ground surface or uncovered in the shovel tests.

Section C
This section contains a forested area similar to Section B, but the ground visibility was
less. A residence and storage facility are present and make-up about a fourth of the
section. Shovel tests 12 through 15 were excavated and encountered 35, 38, 37 and 34 cm
of culturally sterile clay. Mowed trails that were eroded in places are present in this
section. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface or
uncovered in the shovel tests.
Section D
Section D is the largest section and ranges from south of Hackberry Creek Park Road to
the shore of Lake Lewisville. This area contains the largest amount of poison oak and
ivy. The disturbance is greater than shown on Figure 6 and only a narrow band of
undisturbed terrain is present south of the road and in the locality of Shovel tests 21
through 23. Eight shovel tests (16 through 23) were excavated and uncovered 37, 37, 38,
36, 34, 38, 35 and 34 cm of culturally sterile clay. No cultural materials older than 50
years were seen on the ground surface. A survey of the shoreline failed to discover any
archaeological sites.
Conclusions
No archaeological sites were found during the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
of the study area. The distance from reliable water sources seems to be a factor in the
placement of prehistoric sites in the Lake Lewisville area. The absence of historic sites
may be that this area was more suitable for farming. The recorded historic sites are
present further downslope. The shoreline was intensively surveyed for any artifacts
associated with sites 41DN404 or 41DN405. Based on the coordinates, it appears that site
41DN404 is misplaced. However, no artifacts were found associated with site 41DN405
which is located on the shoreline south of Area D. The site may be located further
downslope and under water although the lake was down 4.6 feet below its normal level at
the time of the survey. Approximately 15 m of the eroded shoreline was exposed, but no
cultural materials older than 50 years were found. The site being under water is supported
by the statement of one of the park attendant’s statement that she found historic trash
further west along the shore when the lake was down approximately 17 feet. The site was
under water when we talked with her.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the systematic pedestrian survey and the excavation of 23 shovel tests, it is AR
Consultants’ conclusion that buried cultural resources are not present and that further
archaeological investigations are unwarranted. However if buried cultural deposits are
encountered during construction, work should immediately stop in that area and the Fort
Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers should be notified.
