PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE BLOOM
MOUND, CHA YES COUNTY, NEW MEXICO
JANE HoLDEN

One pit house and one adobe-walled room were dug at
Bloom Mound during the 1954 field session of the Museum
of Texas Technological College. This work was done in
cooperation with the Roswell Archeological Society, which
had been working in the site for several years. This report
covers only the present excavation, as the materials obtained
previously were not available for study.
Bloom Mound is located approximately 12 miles westsouthwest of Roswell, New Mexico, at the base of the Sacramento Mountains, and on the north bank of Hondo River.
The approximate elevation is 3,775 feet (Fig. 6).
The artifacts will be discussed in the section dealing with
the room in which they were found. Room designations are
those of the Roswell Archeological Society. Pottery .types
will be dealt with separately.
ROOM F
This is a large, deep pit house, roughly 20 feet square
(Plate 21, A and Fig. 7, A). In the northwest corner, the
plastered wall is 7 feet high. This is only a few inches below
the surface at the present time; however, a blade was used
by the Society to remove overburden, so it is impossible
to say how much fill had accumulated over the old surface.
The pit house is at least 7 feet deep, as the plastered wall
is that high in the northwest corner. Most of this depth is
through silt and gravel, while the last 8 inches is through
a soft gypsum. The floor is exceedingly level, and consists
throughout of the gypsum.
The roof was undoubtedly supported by large beams
spanning the four central posts. Over these were pl;;tced
smaller poles. A heavy grass matting overlaid these poles.
In places, this matting remained 5 inches thick. The grass
was tied to the poles with what appears to be a yucca fibre
at intervals of about 12 inches. The whole was covered with

a heavy layer of clay. The roof must have been flat, and
almost on the same level as the ground outside, considering
the depth of the pit.
Four large central posts supported the roof. Each of these
post holes is 11 or 12 inches in diameter, and 14 to 16 inches
deep. These were dug into gypsum. Three of these posts
had been burned to the floor level; the wood has not been
definitely identified, but apparently pine was used for these
posts. An auxiliary post is located in the northwest corner;
it is not charred, and is standing to a height of 4 feet above
the floor.
A fire pit is centrally located. It is a cylindrical pit 12
inches deep and 12 inches in diameter, with a clay rim built
up 4 inches above the floor.
Just 12 inches east of the firepit is a pit dug into gypsum,
9 inches in diameter and 14 inches deep. Over this was a
perforated metate that had been plastered in place to form
the mouth of the pit. The metate is 20 inches long, lllf2
inches wide, and the opening is 41/2 inches by 5 inches.
Both sides of the metate had been well ground; the side
that showed the deepest grinding had been placed face
down.
One crudely chipped white chert projectile point was
found on the floor. A grey chert knife came from the same
location. This knife is oval in shape and shows rather careful
chipping on both sides.
A full-grooved maul or hammer came from above the
roof debris ; it measures 3¥2 inches long and 2 2/ 3 inches
wide at the base. Three metate fragments were found
stacked together on the floor against the north wall. They
were of the slab type. A small stone bead, 3fs inch in diameter,
and shaped like a doughnut, was found with four shell
beads. The four shell beads are flat discs. One had a diameter
of lf4 inch, while the other three measured 3/ 16 inch in
diameter.
Fragments of human bones occurred throughout the fill.

For instance, a charred mandible came from the area by
the west wall. Fragments of a baby skull came from just
above the floor in the southeast corner. A femur was close
to the fireplace.
There were two possible burials. Neither was articulated,
and both were very fragmentary. Both were in the fill above
the roof; they were on the same level, just 3 feet apart.
It is possible that this is a secondary disposal of the bodies,
judging from their confused positions.
One skeleton from the northeast section of the room
tells a tragic story. An adult male was apparently trying
to get out of the building while it burned. The upper part
of the body was on the top of the roof; the leg bones extended through the roof, and the right foot rested on the
floor.
ROOMG
This room is bounded by previously excavated rooms on
the south and east (Plate 21, B and Fig. 7, B). It is well
defined by hard adobe walls that are standing from 11 to
21 inches high. These walls are made of puddled adobe
that exhibits vertical cracks. These cracks may be a natural
result of drying adobe, or they may show the method used
to build the wall; that is, the adobe may have been molded
in sections at one time. The roofing clay and poles are close
to the surface. There was an unusual amount of charred
straw and reeds mixed with the roofing clay. The position
and condition of this straw would indicate that it was on
the inside of the room. A central post is the only interior
roof support. The room lacks a firepit of any sort.
A small Chupadero Black-on-white jug (Plate 22, C) was
found on the floor. There was apparently a wooden stopper
in the jug, but it was badly decayed. Inside the jug were
kernels of corn. Possibly this was corn that had been saved
for planting, as the amount is so small that it could hardly
have served as the bread of one meal. This small jug was

172

Texas Archeological Society

sitting on a charred bundle of grass that was tied tightly.
Possibly this was a broom (Plate 22, A).
A large Chupadero Black-on-white jug was also on the
floor. It had been broken by the fall of the roof. Inside
this jug was a large knife blade of dark red flint (Plate
22, G).
A small undecorated jar was likewise found on the floor
(Plate 22, D). The rim is like that of El Paso Polychrome,
as is the paste and wall thickness. This jar was resting on
a metate surrounded by charred straw.
A large olla of El Paso ware was near the west wall,
resting on a charred mat that is rather reminiscent of a
finely woven Mexican petate (See Plate 23, A for a fragment of the mat). It contained the following artifacts:
1. Two worked stones made from a slab of micaceous
schist. One is 4% inches long and 1 1/z inch wide. It is flat
and of uniform thickness of about 3/s inch. One edge is
ground to form a dull blade. Some red ochre adheres to
one surface. The other stone is not as finely ground, and
measures 3 inches long and 2 inches wide.

2. A scraper of translucent flint (Plate 23, C) .
3. A projectile point of brown flint (Plate 23, I) .
4. Miscellaneous unworked stones, identified as calcite
crystal and crystalline quartz; and four small brachiopods
which may be from localized microfauna in the San Andres
formation. These must have been picked up as curiosities.
5. Shell objects, including one fresh-water mollusk shell,
one Olivella bead, and one unfinished shell bead (the hole
was not drilled completely through).
6. Two worked bones (Plate 23, M) . These were probably
bound together with a reed mouthpiece to form a whistle.
7. A bone spatula lOYz inches long (Plate 22, F).
8. A second bone spatula, perhaps showing signs of working on one edge (Plate 22, E).

9. A hair ornament that has a carved base (Plate 23, N).
A large, heavily corrugated cooking pot was resting on
some basketry, close to the central post. This pot contained
no artifacts.
Two charred trays were flattened on the floor (Plate
22, B). Both were made by use of split coils over a fibre
bundle. (For a fragment of this type basketry, see Plate
23, B) . The size of these baskets cannot be given as they
are in the Roswell Museum.
Miscellaneous artifacts found scattered over the floor
include two projectile points. One is of black flint, about
1 inch long, side notched, slightly concave base (Plate 23, G) .
The other is too fragmentary to describe the type (Plate
23, H). The scrapers are made of random flint flakes (Plate
23, D, E) . A full-grooved stone axe is 6 inches long and
3% inches wide. It is made from cherty limestone.
A slab metate 10 inches wide and 22 inches long is from
the upper layer of the fill. Two metate fragments were
on the floor. One is a trough type, and it was in this metate that the small undecorated jar was sitting. The other
metate is too fragmentary to classify.
One small one-hand mano of quartzite was on the floor.
Another mano, 7% inches long, was present in the upper
layer.
Considering the abundance of material in this room, and
the fact that there is no fireplace, the obvious conclusion
is that this was a storage room.
POTTERY
The pottery from Bloom shows no clear-cut stratigraphic
difference between the deep pit house and the adobe surface structure. Hence, the statistics given here apply to the
total sherd count.

Sherds that occur in extremely small quantities are:

Rio Grande Glaze I
The majority of the pottery belongs to the brownware
complex. J ornado Brown is the most numerous, with El
Paso Polychrome being second numerically. Only one sherd
of J ornado Polychrome occurs, but this is to be expected,
as this form occurs in earlier sites.
A type of red-on-brown ware is present that is unfamiliar
to the author. The vessel form, rim form, and thickness of
the vessel wall are identical to those of El Paso Polychrome.
However, the paste is tan and lacks the extremely large
tempering particles so characteristic of the latter type. The
design consists of broad red bands. Possibly it is simply an
aberrant form of El Paso Polychrome, or possibly it is an
undescribed pottery. However, further evidence is needed
to establish it as a definite type.
Of the intrusive sherds, the Glaze I allows dating of the
site at 1350 to 1400 A.D. These sherds undoubtedly originated in the southern part of the Rio Grande Glaze area.
Gila Polychrome falls into the same period and is probably from eastern Arizona. St. Johns Polychrome likewise
falls within this time period and came from west-central
New Mexico.
Mimbres Black-on-white is found associated with this
ceramic complex in other sites in the area. This is thought
to be the latest appearance of Bold Faced Mimbres.

179

An unusual intrusive sherd is Santa Fe Black-on-white.
This is the first Santa Fe Black-on-white sherd to be identified from the immediate area. As the name indicates, this
sherd originated in the vicinity of Santa Fe.
FOOD
Animal bones are abundant in the site. In a superficial
survey, the following bones were identified: bison, deer,
antelope, rabbits, squirrels, and birds of several types.
Corn was abundant at the site. Records of the Roswell
Archeological Society list beans and squash as having been
identified. In Room G there was a charred pit of what has
been tentatively identified as cactus fruit (such as pitahaya
or tuna).
COPPER BELLS
Three copper bells were found in previous excavations
by the Roswell Archeological Society. This is thought to
be the easternmost occurrence of such bells.
SUMMARY
The eastern boundary of the sedentary dwellers of this
particular area of New Mexico seems to be the Pecos River.
No permanent villages are known east of the Pecos; instead,
the remains from the Pecos into the sand hills of west
Texas indicate nomadic camp sites. Judging from the pottery found in these camps (brown wares are the most common, with Chupadero Black-on-white and Glaze I red occurring not infrequently), the hunters originated in this
southern area of New Mexico. The presence of Glaze I in
many of these camp sites places their occupation in the
same time period as Bloom Mound and other sites.
Bloom Mound represents one of the easternmost sedentary
villages, as it is located close to the junction of the Hondo

l80 _____________T_e_x_a_s_A_r_c_h__e_

g_ic_a_l_S_o_

~-------

and the Pecos rivers. The beginning date of the site is uncertain, but it is felt that it was slightly before 1300. The
presence of Glaze I and the absence of later glazes places
the terminal date close to 1450.
This period from 1300 to 1450 was a time of extensive
population expansion. There are numerous sites on all the
rivers between the Pecos and the mountains immediately
to the west that belong to this expansion period. Such a
site is the Bonnell Site, about 50 miles west of Bloom
Mound, reported by the author in this Bulletin, Vol. 23, pp.
78-132, 1952.
The population increase corresponds in part to a southern
movement of Pueblo IV peoples. Large pueblos do not extend as far south as Bloom Mound; rather, the last concentration of square pueblos (many containing up to 120
rooms) seems to be the Gallo and the Macho drainages.
The upper adobe-walled Room G is one of a double line
of rooms of a surface structure. The whole house may have
contained 12 rooms, of which six have been excavated.
The Pueblo IV peoples must have mixed with the local
builders of the deep pit house, as the Pueblo traits become
fused with those already existing in the Jornado area. The
pottery continues to be predominantly of the brownware
tradition, with an increasing number of intrusive sherds,
many stemming from the northern Pueblo area.
The deep pit house is thought to be earlier than the upper
adobe structure. Evidence to support this theory is the
presence of flood-borne gravel and silt that broke through
the west wall of the pit house. The adobe structure is built
above this flood deposit. Other clear-cut cases of an age
distinction between the two house types is lacking. Pottery
types remain nearly constant from all levels.

Preliminary Report on the. Bloom Mound

181

Two almost identical pit houses have been found at the
Bonnell Site. They are alike as regards size, floor features,
and quality of workmanship. The only unique feature of
Bloom Mound House F is the pit to the east of the fireplace
covered by a metate.
It is hoped that a full report can be written on this site,

using the materials obtained by the Roswell Archeological
Society. Because this appears to be a critical site in the
study of the Jornado area, it was deemed advisable to
publish this brief report. Our sincerest thanks are extended
to the Roswell Archeological Society, especially to Col.
Sayre, for cooperation in this endeavor.
