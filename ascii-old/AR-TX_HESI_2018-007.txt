MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 12 October 2017, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of American Midstream Partners, LP’s (AMP) proposed Ajax
UL6-31 Lateral pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located in northeastern Andrews and northwestern
Martin counties, Texas (Project Area). The development of the pipeline ROW will be privately
funded and will not require any federal permitting or coordination. However, it is located entirely
on land owned by the University of Texas (UT Land). As UT Land is considered to be public
property, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At
the request of Venado Environmental, LLC (Venado), Horizon conducted the cultural resources
survey of the Project Area on behalf of AMP in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the
survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if
any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural
resources survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number
8193.
The Project Area measures approximately 2.3 miles (3.8 kilometers [km]) long by 100.0
feet (30.5 meters [m]) wide (approximately 27.9 acres). The entire length of the proposed ROW
is located on UT Land.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 35
excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Ajax UL6-31 Lateral Project across UT Land will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon
therefore recommends that AMP be allowed to proceed with the construction of the proposed
pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of American
Midstream Partners, LP’s (AMP) proposed Ajax UL6-31 Lateral pipeline right-of-way (ROW)
located in northeastern Andrews and northwestern Martin counties, Texas (Project Area;
Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The development of the pipeline ROW will be privately funded and will not
require any federal permitting or coordination. However, it is located entirely on land owned by
the University of Texas (UT Land). As UT Land is considered to be public property, the
undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of
Venado Environmental, LLC (Venado), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of AMP in compliance
with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were
located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to
have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs).
The Project Area measures approximately 2.3 miles (3.8 kilometers [km]) long by 100.0
feet (30.5 meters [m]) wide (approximately 27.9 acres). The entire length of the proposed ROW
is located on UT Land.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s principal investigator,
while Jacob Lyons and Jared Wiersema (Horizon field technicians) conducted the field
investigations. The cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit number 8193.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 12 October 2017. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing along the length of the Project Area.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16
shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the
Project Area totals 2.3 miles (3.8 km) in length, a minimum of 38 shovel tests were necessary

within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon fell just short of the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 35 shovel tests across the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 35
excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Ajax UL6-31 Lateral Project across UT Land will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon
therefore recommends that AMP be allowed to proceed with the construction of the proposed
pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed pipeline ROW, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately,
and the THC and UT should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

AMP’S proposed Ajax UL6-31 Lateral Project is located in northeastern Andrews and
northwestern Martin counties, approximately 20.0 miles (32.2 km) northeast of Andrews, Texas.
It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Scharbauer Ranch, Texas,
topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 1-1). The Project Area consists of a pipeline ROW
that measures approximately 2.3 miles (3.8 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide (approximately
27.9 acres). The entire length of the proposed ROW is located on UT Land. Representative
images of the Project Area at the time of the cultural resources survey are presented in Figures
2-1 and 2-2.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in northeastern Andrews and northwestern Martin counties in
far West Texas. It is situated within an area of gently undulating desert hills dotted with several
small playa basins to the north of Mustang Draw (see Figure 1-1). The proposed ROW initiates
at an existing well pad in Andrews County and extends southeasterly to an existing gathering
line in Martin County. Elevations within the Project Area range between 2920.0 and 2950.0 feet
(890.0 and 899.2 m) above mean sea level. Hydrologically, the proposed ROW is situated
within the Colorado River basin. It is drained to the south by Mustang Draw. Mustang Draw
flows to the southeast, joining Beals Creek approximately 38.6 miles (62.2 km) southeast of the
Project Area. Beals Creek flows easterly, joining the Colorado River approximately 81.2 miles
(130.6 km) southeast of the Project Area.

2.3

CLIMATE

Andrews and Martin counties have cool-temperate, dry steppe climates. Winters are
mild, with an average temperature of 46.2 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are
hot, with an average temperature exceeding 90.0°F. The average annual total precipitation is
about 14.0 inches (35.6 centimeters [cm]), with most of it falling between May and October
(NRCS 1974a and 1974b).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is situated within Blair’s Kansan biotic province that takes in the
Panhandle and the red plains to the east of the escarpment of the high plains. The plants and
animals are mostly grassland species, but some Austroriparian species extend along wooded
stream valleys into the eastern part of the province (Blair 1950). The proposed ROW is located
along the southern edge of the Llano Estacado ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). The Llano
Estacado ecoregion was historically a shortgrass prairie supporting large herds of buffalo.
Common plants species on these prairies included buffalograss, blue and sideoats grama, silver
bluestem, mesquite, yucca, prickly pear, and juniper (Griffith et al. 2007). In addition to
supporting vast bison herds, this ecosystem also included prairie dogs, black-footed ferrets,
burrowing owls, coyotes, pronghorn antelope, gray wolves, and a variety of deer. Playa basins
scattered across this region also attracted migratory waterfowl such as the sandhill crane
(Griffith et al. 2007).

SOILS

A total of 5 soil types are mapped along the Project Area. These soils are presented in

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of American Midstream Partners, LP’s Proposed
Ajax UL6-31 Lateral Project Located on UT Land in Andrews and Martin Counties, Texas

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: the Paleoindian (pre-8500
B.P.), the Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and the Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic
period is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), the Middle Archaic (6000
BP to 3500 B.P.), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 B.P.)

The Paleoindian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game such as deer and turtles were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early Paleoindian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 B.P.)

Like the Paleoindian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies
in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.

HJN 170212 AR

9

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries, as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC I (1250 TO 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow in
Texas, as well as ceramics. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As with the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is highly evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the
recovery of burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices
also suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area (THC 2017). Similarly, a
review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) Nation Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google
Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the
review perimeter (NPS 2017). No documented cultural resources, including any listed on the
NRHP or formally designated as SALs, are located within or immediately adjacent to the
boundaries of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources
surveys have been undertaken within the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a historic-era WWII
bombing target practice area. This site, 41Ad66, is located approximately 4.3 miles (6.9 km)
west of the Project Area.

4.2

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are
often found in proximity to playa lake beds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the
Project Area on elevated landforms above several playa basins, it was Horizon’s opinion, prior
to the field efforts, that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric
cultural deposits within the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to
the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle maps suggested a decreased potential
for historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the Project Area on 12 October 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and
subsurface shovel testing along the length of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a
minimum 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide.
As the Project Area totals 2.3 miles (3.8 km) in length, a minimum of 38 shovel tests were
necessary within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon fell just short of
the TSMASS by excavating a total of 35 shovel tests across the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site forms were
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated
site forms were completed and filed at the TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD
83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 5-1. Shovel test data are presented in
Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

On 12 October 2017, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of AMP’s
proposed Ajax UL6-31 Lateral pipeline ROW located in northeastern Andrews and northwestern
Martin counties, Texas. The development of the pipeline ROW will be privately funded and will
not require any federal permitting or coordination. However, it is located entirely on land owned
by the University of Texas. As UT Land is considered to be public property, the undertaking
falls under the regulations of the ACT. At the request of Venado, Horizon conducted the cultural
resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of AMP in compliance with the ACT. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project
Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse
impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as SALs. The cultural resources
survey was conducted under TAC permit number 8193.
The Project Area measures approximately 2.3 miles (3.8 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
wide (approximately 27.9 acres). The entire length of the proposed ROW is located on UT
Land.
The cultural resources survey consisted of intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing along the length of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the Project Area

The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 35

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
