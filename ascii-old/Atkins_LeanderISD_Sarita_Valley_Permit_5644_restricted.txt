Abstract
In May and June 2010, PBS&J conducted a cultural resources survey of a 163-acre area in
Williamson County, Texas, at the request of Leander Independent School District. The project area
is proposed for future construction of Leander Independent School District’s schools and facilities.
One previously recorded cultural resource site (41WM1168) was relocated and one new cultural
resource site (41WM1255) was located and recorded. No artifacts were collected, but field records
will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Cultural resource clearance is
recommended for the project.

Due to the high degree of ground surface visibility, low potential for intact buried cultural deposits,
and heavily disturbed soils due to past cultivation and other activities, a total of 24 shovel tests
were excavated. The state guidelines for intensity of shovel tests were not met.

I. INTRODUCTION
In May and June 2010, PBS&J conducted a cultural resource survey for the Leander Independent
School District in west-central Williamson County, Texas, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5644.
The project area is proposed for future construction of school facilities. The purpose of the
investigation was to locate, describe, document, and assess all existing cultural resources that
would be affected by the proposed project. The project area is approximately 163 acres (66
hectares) in area centered approximately 1,640 feet (ft) (500 meters [m]) southeast of the
intersection of State Highway 2243 and Williamson County Road 175 and 3 miles (5 kilometers
[km]) east of the city center of Leander (Figure 1). The archeological field investigation was
conducted by PBS&J archeologist Michael Nash who also served as Principal Investigator and senior
author of this report of investigations. Historic research was conducted by Casey Hanson who
authored the Property Historic section of Chapter V.
This study was performed in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Title 9, Chapter 191,
Texas Natural Resources Code of 1977) and other appropriate cultural resources legislation and
guidelines, as well as the guidelines set forth by the Register of Professional Archaeologists and the
Council of Texas Archeologists.

II. METHODOLOGY
Prior to the field investigation, PBS&J conducted a records search at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in order to identify any previous cultural resource investigations
and/or previously recorded sites within 2 km of the project area. This search included all recorded
cultural resource sites as well any sites listed on or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places or designated as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). Modern and historic United
States Geological Survey (USGS) maps, historic Texas Highway Department Maps, and historic
aerial photographs of the project area and vicinity were also reviewed.

PBS&J archeologists conducted an intensive 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project area
utilizing parallel pedestrian transects spaced approximately 30 m apart. In accordance with the
scope of work, shovel tests were only excavated in areas of low surface visibility or perceived
potential for buried deposits. Due to the high degree of ground surface visibility, low potential for
intact buried cultural deposits, and heavily disturbed soils due to past cultivation and other
activities, a total of 24 shovel tests were excavated. The state guidelines for intensity of shovel tests
were not met.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
PHYSIOGRAPHY/GEOLOGY
The project area is situated on level to moderately sloping uplands in the Texas Hill Country. The
southern boundary of the project area roughly parallels Brushy Creek, a small perennial stream
situated 30 to 100 m south of the project area. An unnamed seasonal tributary of Brushy Creek
flows north-south through the project area with two smaller branches. Water was present
intermittently in the tributary and its branches at the time of survey.

The Texas Hill Country is a highly dissected plateau characterized by a predominant oak-juniper
woodland/shrubland interspersed with pastures dominated by scattered trees and short to mid
grasses and forbs (Hatch et al. 1990). McMahan et al. (1984) identify the project area and vicinity as
Oak-Mesquite-Juniper Parks/Woods.

According to the Williamson County soil survey (Werchan and Coker 1983), the project area is
situated on Fairlie clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes, Crawford clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, Denton silty clay,
1 to 3 percent slopes, Doss silty clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes, and Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent
slopes

The Fairlie series consists of deep, moderately well-drained, clayey and calcareous soils on uplands
overlying weakly cemented limestone. This soil is found in pastures and fallow and cultivated fields
of the southern part of the project area, and is the most common soil series, accounting for
approximately 33 percent of the soils in the project area. Denton soils are moderately deep, welldrained, clayey soils overlying limestone on uplands and are associated primarily with timbered
areas in the central and northwestern parts of the project area, accounting for about 27 percent of
the soils in the project area. The Doss series, composing about 14 percent of the project area, are
shallow, well-drained, clayey soils on uplands with limestone fragments overlying cemented limey
earth and limestone. Doss soils are located primarily on fallow fields in the northwestern part of the
project area. The Eckrant series, found in the rangeland of the northern and northeastern portions
of the project area, account for 14 percent of the soils. Eckrant soils consist of shallow to very
shallow, well-drained, stony and clayey soils overlying limestone on uplands. The Crawford clay
series consists of moderately deep, well-drained, clayey soils overlying fractured limestone on
uplands and occurs primarily in the cultivated fields in the western portion of the project area,
composing about 12 percent of the total area. All of these soils are upland clayey soils with very
little potential for burying archeological resources.

CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGY

The prevailing local climate is humid subtropical. Summers are usually long with hot days and
warm nights (Werchan and Coker 1983). Winters are normally mild with occasional polar air
100011661/100131

III. Environmental Setting
intrusions of short duration and below-freezing temperatures occurring less than 25 days each
year. Temperatures in the area range from an average high of 95 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) (35
degrees Celsius [°C]) in summer to an average low of 38°F (3°C) in winter. The average annual
precipitation is approximately 34 inches (87 centimeters [cm]) and is fairly evenly distributed
throughout the year.

FLORA

The project area occurs on nearly level uplands within the Edwards Plateau vegetational region of
Texas, as described by Hatch et al. (1990), with cultivated hay fields in the eastern and western
parts of the project area, timber in the northwestern and northwest-central part of the project area,
rangeland in the northern and northwestern parts of the project area, and open pasture in the
southern and northwest corner of the project area. Vegetation in pasture and range areas consists
of various grasses and forbs, including Johnsongrass, little bluestem, goldenrod, nettle, and prickly
pear with scattered juniper and mesquite. Timbered areas in the central and northeastern portions
of the project area are dominated by juniper, cedar elm, live oak, and hackberry.

FAUNA

The project area is along the eastern edge of the Balconian biotic province, as described by Blair
(1950). Wildlife species of potential or actual occurrence in the project vicinity include such
mammalian species as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus
floridanus), common gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), northern raccoon (Procyon lotor), and
striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Avian wildlife species of potential occurrence in the project
vicinity include species such as Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis), northern cardinal
(Cardinalis cardinalis), western scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica), golden-fronted woodpecker
(Melanerpes aurifrons), and mourning dove (Zenaida macroura). Common reptile species include
green anole (Anolis carolinensis), Texas spiny lizard (Sceloporus olivaceus), little brown skink
(Scincella lateralis), and Texas ratsnake (Elaphe obsoleta).

IV. CULTURAL BACKGROUND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A TARL records search identified six previously recorded cultural resources within 1 km of the
project area. These sites are 41WM1005, 41WM1040, 41WM1041, 41WM1100, 41WM1168, and
41WM1202.

Site 41WM1005 is located approximately 1,000 m northwest of the project area. It is a historic
dump location dating approximately to the late nineteenth or early twentieth century recorded by
Ron Ralph and Reign Clark of Horizon Environmental Services for the widening of FM 2243 (Ralph
and Brownlow 2004). The project was conducted for the City of Cedar Park. During another survey
for the same project in 2004, Melinda Tate Iruegas of Horizon Environmental Services recorded site
41WM1100. This site is a surface and shallow subsurface lithic and burned rock scatter located
about 700 m northeast of the project area.
Sites 41WM1040 and 41WM1041 were recorded by Sean Nash of Archaeological and Cultural
Sciences Group in 2002 during a cultural resources survey for the Palmer Lane Extension and
Improvement Project (now known as Ronald W. Reagan Boulevard in this area). Site 41WM1040,
located about 250 m west of the project area, consists of a surface lithic scatter and a disturbed
burned rock midden. Site 41WM1041, located about 200 m southwest of the project area, consists
of a surface lithic scatter and a relatively intact burned rock midden (Nash et al. 2002).

Site 41WM1168 is a sparse surface lithic scatter recorded in 2007 by Reign Clark and Michael Mudd
of Horizon Environmental Services for a proposed residential development (Owens 2007). Site
41WM1168 is located within the present project area and will be impacted by the proposed
development. Site 41WM1168 was recommended as not eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) when originally recorded. The Texas Historical Commission concurred
with this recommendation.

Site 41WM1202 is a burned rock midden about 450 m southeast of the project area recorded by
Michael Chavez and Laura Acuna of SWCA Environmental Consutlants in 2008 during a survey for
the Northern Brushy Creek Interceptor Project sponsored by the City of Cedar Park.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY

Williamson County is located in the Central and Southern Archeological Planning Region of Texas
(Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996). The cultural developments in the region are usually classified by
archeologists according to four primary chronological and developmental stages. These are the
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic periods. Changes in material culture over time
have been used as indicators of the four temporal periods. One general theoretical tenet that
100011661/100131

6

IV. Cultural Background
underlies this classification scheme is that change in material culture reflects behavioral and
cultural adaptation to change in the natural and manmade environment.

The earliest occupations documented for the area date to the Paleoindian period. This period,
beginning prior to 10,000 B.C. and continuing to about 6000 B.C. (Black 1989), coincides with the
decline of the Wisconsin glaciation and is characterized by a relatively cool, moist climate.
Paleoindian populations were apparently small groups of transient hunters whose lifeways
revolved around the exploitation of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna such as mammoth,
mastodon, camel, and bison. However, in most areas, particularly outside of the Great Plains,
big-game hunting was probably supplemented by exploitation of plants and smaller game.

The distinctive tool kit of the Paleoindian period includes finely chipped and sometimes fluted
lanceolate-shaped projectile points. In chronological order, the fluted Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San
Patrice, and Big Sandy types represent the early Paleoindian period and unfluted Plainview,
Golondrina, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura projectile point types are typically recognized as
characterizing the later part of the period (Black 1989). Most of the evidence for Paleoindian
occupations is based on surface finds. Few intact sites dating to this period have been recorded or
investigated in this region partly because Paleoindian deposits are deeply buried in various alluvial
settings or are difficult to locate and study due to their ephemeral nature. However, at least three
Paleoindian sites in the east-central Texas area have been recorded and investigated; these include
the Gault site (41BL323) in Bell County, the Levi site (41TV49) in Travis County (Alexander 1963),
and the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) in Williamson County (Collins 1998).
At the end of the Paleoindian period, the archeological record exhibits evidence of a diversification
of subsistence patterns that marks the beginning of a long (6000 B.C. to A.D. 800) and complex
chronological period referred to as the Archaic (Hester et al. 1989). The Archaic period is
commonly divided into three or more subdivisions, most often designated as the Early (6000 to
3000 B.C.), Middle (3000 to 1000 B.C.), and Late (1000 B.C. to A.D. 800). The Archaic period cultures
are generally characterized as having a more diversified resource base than earlier groups, with
subsistence dependent on hunting modern species of game including deer and rabbit, and gathering
edible roots, nuts, and fruits (Black 1989). Site types include rockshelters, campsites, lookout sites,
and quarry sites. These sites are usually located near a reliable water source.

Early Archaic groups continue to exhibit many of the characteristics of the preceding Paleoindian
period, and the early part of this period is sometimes referred to as transitional between the
Paleoindian and the Archaic periods. Most of the projectile points from this period are well made,
and many exhibit characteristics typical of Paleoindian technologies, such as lateral edge grinding.
In addition, Early Archaic artifact forms have been recovered beyond the boundaries of central
Texas. The variety of projectile point types distributed over such a large area has prompted Prewitt
(1981) to suggest that these people were organized in small, dispersed bands that roamed broad
territories.
100011661/100131

7

IV. Cultural Background
The Middle Archaic can be subdivided into early (Clear Fork) and late (Round Rock) intervals.
Nolan and Travis projectile points are indicative of the Clear Fork interval, and the Round Rock
interval is marked by Pedernales, Marshall, and Langtry points. The Langtry point is an especially
common type in the Lower Pecos. It was during the Middle Archaic that burned rock middens
became a specialized site type (Black 1989). This site type becomes extremely common during this
period, suggesting an intensive and perhaps rather specialized plant-processing economy. Weir
(1976) has also suggested population increase and possible developments in social organization
during this period. Projectile points from this period are quite numerous, occurring in large
frequencies at some sites. They tend to be large and straight stemmed and are often not as well
made as points from earlier or later periods.
By the beginning of the Late Archaic, a proliferation of projectile point types again occurred, and
burned rock middens were either no longer created or had become a minor aspect of subsistence.
Prewitt (1981) has suggested that the proliferation of projectile points during the earliest phase of
the subperiod may represent a return to the Early Archaic pattern of small, dispersed bands with
wide-ranging territorial areas. The latter part of the Late Archaic appears to be marked by an
emphasis on the utilization of a variety of food resources, perhaps indicative of population or
climatic stress at this time.

Projectile points diagnostic of the early part of the Late Archaic include Bulverde and Pedernales.
Later in the period, Darl, Ensor, Frio, and Mahomet points became prominent. Terrace locations are
still the primary locations for sites of this period but with less emphasis on midden sites, and
rockshelters are more commonly utilized.
The Late Prehistoric period is marked by the introduction of several technological advances, most
notably the bow and arrow and ceramics. The bow and arrow quickly became the standard weapon,
replacing the throwing stick, or atlatl, and small thin arrow points became a key indicator among
the material remains of the period. Sometime after the adoption of the bow and arrow, plainware
ceramics were also introduced into the area. This development probably came from agricultural
groups to the east or northeast. There are possible indications of major population movements,
changes in settlement patterns, and perhaps lower population densities during the Late Prehistoric
period (Black 1989).

During the early Historic period, the time of European contact and settlement, the area was
inhabited by numerous aboriginal groups including the Jumano, Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and
Comanche (Newcomb 1961). The Jumano initiated extensive trading activities with the Caddo in
east Texas and the Trans Pecos groups to the west (Suhm 1958). The Tonkawa, originally from
Oklahoma, were one of many native peoples displaced in the second half of the nineteenth century
by the horse-using Apache and forced to move south and southwest (Newcomb and Campbell
1982). During the early part of the nineteenth century, the Tonkawa, represented by a
consolidation of remnants of diverse bands, occupied an area between the Trinity and San Antonio

100011661/100131

IV. Cultural Background
rivers (Gatschet 1891; Newcomb 1961; Sibley 1922; Sjoberg 1953). The Lipan Apache and
Comanche entered the area from the Plains in pursuit of food. Their weapons included the bow and
arrow and lance. Trade items such as glass beads, European-made ceramics, gun parts, and metal
arrow points indicate a contact period occupation.

The first Anglo settlement of Williamson County began during the mid-1830s but was greatly
limited by Indian hostilities until after Texas’s annexation by the United States in 1846. There were
at least 250 settlers in present Williamson County when it was created out of western Milam
County on March 13, 1848. The county seat of Georgetown was laid out during the summer of that
year, and the district court was in session by October. By 1850, Williamson County had a population
of 1,534, including 155 slaves. Most were living in agricultural communities along Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. As was common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage was
used to grow corn.

By 1860, the population grew to 4,529 including 891 slaves. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied
and reflected the county’s geographical diversity. Wheat and corn were the most common crops,
and livestock ranching was widespread. In 1860, the county had 38,111 head of cattle and 16,952
sheep.

No military action occurred in Williamson County during the Civil War. Reconstruction was less
severe than in many parts of the south and ended with the return of county government to
conservative Democratic control in 1869. The economic recovery in the 1870s was aided by the
growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a dramatic expansion of cotton farming. Several
portions to the Chisholm Trail passed through Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed
through or originated in the county from the 1860s through the early 1880s. Cotton production,
which had been insignificant before the war, rose to successive heights of 4,217 bales in 1880,
33,945 bales in 1890, and 80,514 bales in 1900. The proportion of cropland used for cotton
production moved from about one-third of the total in 1880 to a high of 77 percent in 1910.

The International-Great Northern Railroad, which later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific,
was built across the eastern part of the county in 1876 and led to the founding of Taylor and Hutto
and to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened up large areas in Williamson County to
commercial farming.
Dramatic changes in land tenure attended the shift to cotton production. As late as 1880, 1,183 of
the 1,538 farms were still worked by owners. By 1890, only 43 percent of the farms were operated
by owners, and by 1930, the percentage had dropped to 29 percent. Farm tenancy rates began to
decline during the Great Depression with the shift away from cotton and other staple crops.

V. RESULTS
The cultural resources survey was conducted in May and June 2010 by PBS&J archeologist Michael
Nash. A total of 24 shovel tests were excavated within the project area. One previously recorded
prehistoric site, 41WM1168, was revisited and one previously unrecorded historic site,
41WM1255, was recorded during the survey (Figure 2, map pocket, not for public disclosure).
These sites are described below.

41WM1168

Site 41WM1168 is a previously recorded prehistoric site located in the southeast portion the
project area. The site is a relatively sparse surficial lithic scatter located on an upland terrace
overlooking a seasonal stream about 15 m to the west (Figure 3). The site is about 40 m in diameter
and located at an elevation of about 890 ft above mean sea level (amsl). The site was originally
recorded by Reign Clark and Michael Mudd of Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Owens 2007)
during a survey for a proposed development. It was recommended as ineligible for NRHP listing at
that time.

The site is located in a field at the edge of a wooded area. The field is vegetated primarily in native
grasses and scattered nettle and cactus with mature junipers in the woods along the western
margin. The slope of the area is about 1 to 2 percent over most of the site but increases to about 5
percent at the western edge of the site as the topography drops down the adjacent drainage. The
soil at the site is mapped as Denton silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (Werchan and Coker 1983). A
single shovel test was conducted at the site to investigate the site’s potential for intact buried
cultural deposits or features. The shovel test was culturally sterile and exhibited a relatively
uniform dark brown gravelly clay to a depth of 50 cm. During the current survey, surface visibility
ranged from about 30 to 80 percent, averaging about 40 percent. During the surface inspection,
only nondiagnostic chert debitage was observed. No chert raw material was observed.
Based on the lack of potential for intact cultural deposits or features in the upland setting, the
paucity of artifacts, and lack of diagnostic artifacts, features, or activity areas, it is unlikely that
further more-intensive investigation will yield any significant additional information. It is the
opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site is not eligible for the NRHP, and no further
investigation is recommended.

41WM1255

Site 41WM1255 is a newly recorded historic site located in the southeast portion the project area at
an elevation of about 880 ft amsl. Vegetation on the site included mature live oaks, junipers, and
pasture grasses.

V. Results
Site 41WM1255 covers an area of 75 m north-south by 90 m east-west (Figure 4). Site dimensions
were determined by the extent of historic artifacts on the ground surface. The site’s most
prominent feature is a large pile of limestone building stones about 5 by 7 m and 2 m in height
(Figure 5). The limestone includes both cut and uncut stones. The uncut stones consist of both
cobbles and tabular slabs of limestone; many appear to have been shaped by hammering or
chiseling. In the center of the pile is the in situ remnant of a large chimney made primarily of
tabular slabs of limestone cemented with lime mortar approximately 2 by 2 m in size (Figure 6).
Limestone building rubble is also in a few smaller piles, as well as scattered over the site area.
Mr. John Brite, the current lessee of the property, stated that the primary structure at the location
was a large, two-story stone house with a large two-story front porch and a large stone chimney
located in the middle of the structure rather than along an outer wall. Mr. Brite stated that the
structure had been demolished in about 2006, yielding many large cedar beams that were salvaged
by local residents. He also reported that the majority of the building stones had been moved to the
banks of Brushy Creek south of the site and a tributary of Brushy Creek west of the site and used for
erosion control.
Other than limestone rocks, many other artifacts were visible on the ground surface at an average
density of about four artifacts per m2. The most common artifacts observed on the ground surface
were window glass fragments and vessel fragments of colorless glass. Also relatively common were
vessel fragments of aqua, brown, dark blue, and milk glass. Amethyst (solarized), dark olive, and
green glass were present but uncommon, with only one sherd each observed. Ceramics present on
the ground surface consisted primarily of semiporcelain and ironstone sherds with small amounts
of stoneware and blue and brown transfer-printed sherds. Other artifacts present include wood
fragments with square nails, a plastic-encased window fan, a modern ceiling fan fragment, and
unidentified fragments of leather, metal, and plastic. Also associated with the former house location
is a stone alignment that probably represents the former front (south) edge of the house (Figure 7).
The alignment includes about six large stones that are almost flush with the ground and run east to
west for about 12 m. The alignment is about 4 m south of the rubble pile.

A stone-lined well is present in the front of the house. The well is about 30 inches in interior
diameter and about 42 inches in exterior diameter. The aboveground portion of the well has
collapsed to ground level, and the well is filled with rubble to within 3 ft of the surface (Figure 8).
However, it seems likely that the well and its aboveground portion were intact until the house
structure was demolished and bulldozed, so the fill in the well is likely modern.

To the rear (north) of the former house location is an area where melted glass is common. This area
probably represents a trash-burning locus.

V. Results
A pole barn that appears to be modern is situated about 55 m west of the rubble pile (Figure 9). Mr.
Brite, the property lessee, stated that when he began using the property in the early 1980s, the pole
barn appeared to be only a few years old. The barn is made of dimension lumber and wire nails and
is sided and roofed with recycled corrugated tin.

Mr. Brite also remembered that a small log structure used as a storage shed was located between
the former house location and the barn but closer to the barn. A concentration of large limestone
rocks about 6 by 8 m in size that may be foundation remnants for this log structure is located about
40 m west of the rubble pile.

Soils within the site are classified as belonging to Fairlie clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes. The Fairlie
series consists of deep, moderately well-drained, clayey and calcareous soils on uplands overlying
weakly cemented limestone (Werchan and Coker 1983). The profile of this soil type typically
consists of a dark gray clay surface soil about 55 centimeters (cm) in thickness. Below this clay
surface soil, gray to dark grayish brown clay extends to limestone bedrock at an approximate depth
of 115 cm below the surface. Eight shovel tests were performed within the site’s boundary and
encountered stratigraphy consistent with the mapped soil type. Seven of the shovel tests were
positive and one was negative (see Figure 4). The seven positive shovel tests yielded a total of 57
artifacts, which consisted of residential refuse indicative of occupation during the late nineteenth to
mid-twentieth centuries. Artifacts were limited to the upper 30 centimeters below surface (cmbs)
and more than 80 percent of the artifacts were from the upper 20 cmbs (Table 1).

A review of historic topographic maps was conducted to aid in assessing the age of site 41WM1255.
A structure was located in the immediate vicinity of the subject site as early as 1934 as depicted on
a 1934 Williamson County soils map. Earlier maps of the area, including 1893 and 1918 USGS
Georgetown topographic maps, do not depict a structure at the site location; however generally,
only structures in established town locations are represented on these maps. Additional maps of
the area were drawn in very large scale and do not depict structures.

Property History for Site 41WM1255

The present survey covered a single large tract made up of multiple smaller parcels with related
histories, all of which came out of the Milton Hicks first class headright (Texas General Land Office
[GLO], Williamson County Abstract 287) in Williamson County, Texas. The first Class headright was
made into law during the Texas Republic period in 1834 and was issued to “all persons except
Africans and their descendents, and Indians, living in Texas on the day of the Declaration of
Independence” (Texas General Land Office n.d.). Milton Hicks was a single man in 1839 when he
was awarded the grant, and thus he received the rights to one-third of a league of land (1,476 acres)
in Williamson County. Nevertheless, additional evidence suggests that he never occupied this
headright. While awarded in 1839, the grant was not patented until November 15, 1860, and

Description

The above-referenced 1859 transaction describes a lawsuit against Milton Hicks’s heirs in which
their deceased father’s 1/3-league headright grant was transferred to Phil Claiborne of Bastrop
County and George W. Paschal of Travis County by the Williamson County sheriff for $145. It is
unclear from the records how the sheriff came to acquire the property. Two years later, Claiborne
and Paschal conveyed 725 acres of the 1,476-acre Milton Hicks Survey to William Black
(Williamson County Deed Records 8:378). While this document notes that William Black was a
resident of Williamson County, historians were unable to locate Black in Williamson County census
records between 1860 and 1880, suggesting he never occupied the subject tract.
Five years later, in 1866, William Black conveyed 722 acres of the parcel to John Foulks [sic]. This
tract constituted the entire parcel conveyed to Black from Paschal and Claiborne “with the
100011661/100131

20

V. Results
exception of the School House which [was] reserve[d] for the use of the neighborhood” (Williamson
County Deed Records 10:247). John D. Folks [sic] appears in the 1870 Williamson County census as
a 53-year-old farmer from Virginia living with his wife Rebecca (48), son Daniel (12), and a 12year-old African American named Wes Cambell. According to the census data, the Fulkes family
owned $1,500 worth of real estate at that time and lived in the Bagdad Post Office Precinct. The
community of Bagdad is located approximately 1 mile west of present-day Leander, which was not
established until 1882 when the Northwestern Railroad bypassed Bagdad (Odintz 2010). As a
result, the Fulkes family may have lived within or near the project area by 1870.

Between 1869 and 1870, Phil Claiborne and George W. Paschal sold their remaining interest in the
Milton Hicks Survey to Joel Ray (Williamson County Deed Records 11:385; 12:72, 118). Joel Ray
(27) appears in the 1870 Williamson County census living in the vicinity of the Fulkes family with
his wife and three children. The families close proximity to each other suggests that both may have
been living on their holdings in the Hicks Survey. In 1875, Joel Ray sold 52 acres of his holdings in
the Milton Hicks Survey to John D. Fulks [sic] (Williamson County Deed Records 16:241). While he
lived in the area, it does not appear that the Ray family lived on the subject tract, and according to
the deed research, the Fulkes family owned and lived on a considerable portion of the southeast
corner of the Milton Hicks Survey where the subject site is located. By 1875, the Fulkes family tract
extended from Brushy Creek, the western boundary of their parcel, eastward to include a portion of
the John T. Church Survey (GLO Williamson County Abstract 140), which John D. Fulkes patented in
1870 (Figure 10). While the deed research is somewhat unclear, it appears that the subject tract
was acquired by J.D. Fulkes in the transaction from William Black in 1866, and the subsequent
transaction with Joel Ray simply added additional acreage to his existing holdings.
The Fulkes family remained in the area during the late nineteenth century. John D. Fulks [sic] (62)
and his family appears in the 1880 census living one household away from the Penelope Cloud
family. Deed research indicates that Penelope Cloud (33) was the daughter of John D. Fulkes
(Williamson County Deed Records 46:162). According to census research, Penelope was married to
James Cloud by 1870. In that year, the couple and their three children Rebecca (3), James (2), and
Isaac (2 months) lived two households away from Penelope’s father. By 1880, she appears in the
Williamson County census as a widow and headed a household containing seven children including
Rebecca E. (14), James D. (12), Isaac F. (9), Gracey A. (8), Kennedy H. (6), John F. (4), and Lucas A.
(2). The 1880 census indicated that she lived one household away from her father at that time.
John D. Fulkes retained ownership of the portion of the Hicks Survey containing the subject tract
until 1891 when he sold a substantial amount of acreage in the Milton Hicks and John T. Church
surveys to his son Asa Daniel (A.D.) Fulkes (Williamson County Deed Records 57:18). A.D. Fulkes
appears as a resident of Williamson County in the 1900 census records; however, he began selling
portions of the property containing the subject tract to members of the Cloud family in 1894. The

V. Results
property’s association with the Cloud family during this period suggests that they may have
occupied the house at site 41WM1255 after the death of John D. Fulkes. In April 1894, A.D. Fulkes
conveyed two tracts of 19 and 23 acres each from the Hicks Survey to I.F. Cloud of Williamson
County (Williamson County Deed Records 161:130). In 1900, A.D. Fulkes conveyed another 121acre tract in the Hicks Survey to I. F. Cloud, whom the record lists as a resident of Williamson
County (Williamson County Deed Records 99:77). It is likely that I.F. Cloud is Isaac F. Cloud,
Penelope Cloud’s son and A.D. Fulkes’s nephew.

While the deed record indicates that I.F. Cloud was a resident of Williamson County, he does not
appear in the 1900 Williamson County census records, and Penelope Cloud disappears from the
census subsequent to 1900. A.D. Fulkes transferred another 29 acres of the Milton Hicks Survey
along with four other tracts from the John T. Church Survey to an L.A. Cloud (most likely Penelope
Cloud’s son, Lucas A. Cloud) in 1913 (Williamson County Deed Records 161:130). Again, while
listed as a Williamson County resident in the deed record, Lucas A. Cloud does not appear in the
1910 or 1920 Williamson County census records. By 1924, another member of the Cloud family
owned the property containing site 41WM1255. In that year, J.D. Cloud (James D. Cloud) of Jones
County, sold 355.48 acres from the Milton Hicks Survey and 69.5 acres from the John T. Church
Survey to Joseph Branch of Williamson County (Williamson County Deed Records 216:364). It is
unclear how J.D. Cloud acquired the 424.98 acres, which includes the three tracts transferred from
A.D. Fulkes to I.F. Cloud and the 29-acre tract acquired by L.A. Cloud from A.D. Fulkes. However, it
appears that these tracts and all improvements located on the tracts remained in the Fulkes/Cloud
family from 1866 to 1924.
According to contemporary probate records, Joseph Branch passed away in 1928. After his death,
his daughter Ruby Branch Powell received 356 acres containing the subject property from the
Milton Hicks Survey (Williamson County Probate Records 3717). The Branch/Powell family
retained ownership of the property well into the late 1970s; however, it does not appear that they
occupied the subject tract during the early twentieth century. Prior to acquiring the tract, the 1920
Williamson County census lists Joseph Branch and his family as residents of the nearby town of
Leander. The 1920 census also lists Joseph Branch as a stock farmer, suggesting he may have been
using the subject tract as pastureland. Ruby Branch Powell does not appear in the 1930 Williamson
County census records.

In an attempt to supplement the limited archival resources available, PBS&J historians consulted
with two local residents with knowledge of the site. Mrs. Anaray Barhoe, a 102-year-old resident
who grew up in the area, stated that Henry and Ellen Bryson (her aunt and uncle) lived in the
limestone house historically associated with site 41WM1255 in the 1920s, where she would often
help with the cotton harvest. Mrs. Barhoe was unsure if her aunt and uncle ever owned the home,
but clearly remembered that the house was vacant for some time after the Bryson family moved
out. Henry (29), Ellen (27), and their two children appear in the 1910 Williamson County Census as
farmers from Texas working on a farm they owned in Justice Precinct 3. They appear again with a

100011661/100131

V. Results
third child in the 1920 Williamson County Census. In that year, they worked as farmers in Leander
Justice Precinct Number 3, but the records do not indicate whether they owned the land. When
asked about the owners prior to the Brysons, Mrs. Barhoe thought that the Cloud family may have
lived there, but she was not certain (Barhoe 2010).

Mrs. Jesse Stence, an 80-year-old local resident, stated that a family named Landry occupied the
two-story limestone block house located at site 41WM1255 in the 1930s and 1940s. The
households of Albert and Felix Landry appear in the 1930 Williamson County census within the
Justice Precinct 3 area, but the census does not indicate whether they owned their residence. It is
likely that the Landrys worked as tenants for the Branch/Powell family, or just simply rented the
land (Stence 2010).

Mr. John Brite, the current lessee of the property stated that he had used the property since the
early 1980s and the house appeared to have been vacant for several years at that time and
continued to be vacant until it was demolished in about 2006.

Conclusions

The artifact assemblage, primarily the square nails remaining in wood fragments observed on the
surface of the site, strongly suggest that the house was constructed prior to 1900. The archival
research suggests that the house may date to as early as the late 1860s. However, the paucity of
artifacts supporting this early date makes it questionable. The cut limestone blocks and soft lime
mortar suggest that the structure may have been built prior to the construction of the International
and Great Northern Railroad in 1876 in eastern Williamson County, which would have made
sawmill cut lumber available and affordable. Archival research has determined that 41WM1255 is
likely associated with the Fulkes/Cloud family, early residents of Williamson County, and represent
a continuous occupation by this family from the 1860s through the 1920s. Site 41WM1255 has no
known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B, and no
architectural remains of merit and design distinction to qualify for the NRHP under Criterion C.
Given the disturbed context of the archeological remains, the site also lacks integrity to qualify
under NRHP Criterion D for its potential information content. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the site is not eligible for listing in the NRHP, and no further work is
recommended.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The field survey resulted in the location of two cultural resource sites, including previously
recorded site 41WM1168 and newly recorded site 41WM1255.

Site 41WM1168 is a sparse surficial lithic scatter with little potential for intact cultural deposits or
features. No temporally or functionally diagnostic artifacts were observed. Its integrity has been
severely compromised by past agricultural practices. It is not thought to be eligible for the NRHP or
inclusion as a SAL.

Site 41WM1255 is the location of a former farmstead that was occupied from the late nineteenth to
the mid-twentieth centuries. The site has little potential for natural depositional development and
has been heavily disturbed by bulldozing so that no intact cultural deposits are thought to be
present. Rural domestic residences dating to this period are well documented in the regional
literature. For this reason and the lack of intact structures or cultural deposits or features, it is the
opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site does not meet Criteria A, B, C, or D and thus does
not warrant listing in the NRHP or inclusion as a SAL.
Neither prehistoric site 41WM1168 nor historic site 41WM1255 appears to meet the criteria for
listing in the NRHP. No further investigation is recommended in association with the proposed
project, and cultural resources clearance is recommended.
