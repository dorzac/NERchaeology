Report #339
October 2014

Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of a proposed cellular tower
in northeastern Taylor County, Texas. The Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide
Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be
conducted prior to such an undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent
review of this archaeological report was provided by the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeology Division. The total area to be impacted is 5,625 square feet (<0.13 acres) in addition
to a 30-foot wide easement.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on October 18, 2014. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the six shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

funding was involved in the proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking.
In October 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or within
one mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area

Project Environment
The Project Area lies within the extreme northeastern portion of Taylor County, on the southern
edge of the Rolling Plains (Osage Plains), an undulating plain with sometimes steeply eroded
canyons (Fenneman 1931:54). The Rolling Plains, with its silty clay loams and stony clays in the
valleys overlying Permian-age silt and sandstone beds, covers about 80 percent of Taylor County,
gradually changing into fine sandy loams on the eroded slopes of the Edwards Plateau.
Geologically, the area provides abundant outcrops of limestone and gravels from the Edwards
limestone and San Angelo conglomerate formations. Physiographically, the region falls along the
Northwest Margin of the Edwards Plateau Section of the Great Plains province (Fenneman 1931).
Elevation in Taylor county ranges from 1,672 feet to 2,410 feet above mean sea level. The
Callahan Divide is a line of hills that run east to west through the county, and create a natural
watershed, with runoff on the north side of the divide ultimately draining into the Brazos River,
while water drains into the Colorado River south of the divide (Leffler 1996).
The modern climate of the Abilene area is classified as semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall
of just under 24 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year, with
average daily maximum temperatures averaging about 96 degrees in July, to around 31 degrees
in January. The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in frequent
droughts as well as periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of roughly 225
days (Leffler 1996).
Soils
As shown in Figure 4, the Garnet-Potter Tower is to be constructed in Pitzer Weymouth complex
soils commonly found on 1 to 3 percent uplands in this area of Taylor County. Pitzer Weymouth
complex soils formed in loamy sediments over indurated caliche, and as such are generally
shallow.
Typically, the upper six inches is gravelly loam. Below that, from about 6 to 14 inches is gravelly
loam with fractured caliche and limestone fragments roughly 50 percent by volume. These are
underlain by soft caliche or limestone (Conner 1976; WebSoil Survey Online 2014).

Cultural Chronology
The location of the Garnet-Potter Celluar Tower survey area presumes cultural affinities both
indigenous to the western edge of the north-central Texas region as well as intrusive influences
from the Southern Great Plains (Figure 5). Several scholars have offered sound but differing
arguments for cultural chronologies for the Southern Great Plains extending into northern Texas.
The cultural chronology, defined by complex (in lieu of the terms phase, interval, or period) of
the North American High Plains has been synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and more recently,
the Southern High Plains in Texas by Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd (1995). It should
be noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by shifts in climatic conditions and
subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are indicators of change in central and
south Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived from Johnson and Holliday (1986,
1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are approximate and given as years
before present (B.P.).

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may
have inhabited the
landscape before 11,500
B.P, solid evidence does
not support their
existence. Although
human behavior is
inferred on stone
artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site
(Fox et al. 1992:51-73),
all are problematic. At
Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of
north-central Texas,
r a d i o carbon d a t e s
initially believed to be
from burned charcoal in
human campfires, and
approximating an
antiquity of 40,000 years
were later disproved as
dates on natural coal Figure 5. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from
(Stanford 1982:208-209). Black 1989a).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic
proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on
stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and
with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances
of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains
were occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people
who made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented
the presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include
bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
5

straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called "Goshen" may be present (Hofman 1989:34; Irwin et al. 1973).
A well-documented Paleoindian Clovis site in the southern Great Plains is the McLean site in
Taylor County, west of Abilene (Ray and Bryan 1938; Sellards 1952). Folsom sites in the area
include the Scharbauer site in northwestern Midland County (Wendorf et al. 1955), and the
Adair-Steadman site in north central Nolan County (Tunnel 1977). A fourth site nearby
containing a Milnesand component is Lone Wolf Creek in northeastern Mitchell County
(Wormington 1957). By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered
at the Gault Site in Bell County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian
artifacts have been recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far
(Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940),
archaeological evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either
extinct or otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer,
antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman
1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano
Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of
megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic
hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game
hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas,
such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were
small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed
6

and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the
inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants and animals which would produce the same
amount of calories and protein with the same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile
points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues that the Taylor County area was used more
frequently in the Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of
bison and other game animals on the Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that
population densities were low during this period, and that groups consisted of related individuals
in small bands with "few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based
on diffuse utilization of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly
pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285).
Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains
decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation
of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut
harvests in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black
1989a). Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the
acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and
processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt
this conclusion (e.g., Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock
middens are still a matter of controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach
and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus
seems to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other
plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds
of accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological
7

community, but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about
4500 B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites,
at least in the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as
the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or
fell during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of
burned rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the
Blue Hole site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32
(Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens
at Camp Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County
(Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in
diameter were still very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have
become less specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base
(Black 1989b:30). Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains
area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the
Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story
(1985:44-45) believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981),
Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt
(1980) further posits that population in the Taylor County area peaked during the Late Archaic
with groups moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found
in the region were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still "pre-ceramic" until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45-47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic
points. The most common are Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2011), both of which are short,
triangular points with side notches. The Frio point also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).

8

Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt
(1980) presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's
(1974) contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes,
which also lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.
Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits marks the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period,
including the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central
Texas and the northern South Texas Plain (Black 1989b:32; Story 1985:45-47). Two complexes
following the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from
about 2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts
into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977;
Skinner 1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into
the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to
Hurt (1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is
mirrored in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due
to the increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited
European contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The
cultural context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence
of outside ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos
and Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed
in many sources (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975;
Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan
Apache, and Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989;
Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on
9

the Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994;
Johnson and Campbell 1992).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
A review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the Garnet-Potter Tower site had not been subjected
to a cultural resources survey (Atlas 2014). Although as shown in Figure 3, there were no
professional archaeological surveys shown within one mile on the Texas Atlas, there were in fact
two archaeological sites recorded. The first is 41TA51, described as a prehistoric open campsite
of an unknown age covering approximately one acre, and situated on a knoll and valley slope. It
was first documented in the 1930s by renowned archaeologist E. B. Sayles, a professional
archaeologist with the University of Texas at Austin.
The second site shown in Figure 3 is 41TA53. This site was also one of those recorded by E. B.
Sayles; he described it as a prehistoric open campsite. However, the correct plotting of this site
remains problematic. That is, the site locale as plotted on an upper slope near a tributary of Elm
Creek was re-visited in 2002 by archaeologists during a cultural resources survey of the South
Abilene to Eskota Transmission Line upgrade. At that time, they found only an historic scatter
of historic glass, whiteware, and stoneware.
As of October 18, 2014 there were 275 documented archaeological sites in Taylor County, and
together they begin to convey a glimpse of how the landscape may have been exploited over the
past several millennia in the area. It is evident that humans have lived in the area from the
Paleoindian period, perhaps as long ago as 11,500 years ago.
Roughly half of these 275 sites were documented in the 1920s and 1930s by legendary
archaeologists Cyrus Ray and E. B. Sayles. A hiatus of nearly 50 years ensued until Texas
Antiquity codes and rules provided new guidelines for cultural resources investigations to be a
part of development on public lands, or development funded with public tax dollars. Accordingly,
many more archaeological sites have been recorded in Taylor County, beginning in the 1980s.
Of the 275 sites, 131 are prehistoric open campsites ranging in age from Paleoindian through the
early Historic periods. The Gibson Site (41TA1) is one of those that contains a Paleoindian
component, and was excavated by Ray and Sayles in the 1930s. Other sites also contain either
10

Clovis or Folsom-age artifacts (e.g., the McLean Site [41TA29]).
Lithic scatters make up 69 of the recorded sites, while lithic procurement sites account for 53 of
the 275. Burned rocks middens have been documented on nine of the open campsites. Ten sites
with prehistoric human burials have been recorded. In addition, historic components such as trash
scatters, farmsteads, lone burials, house sites, wells, a school house, CCC structures, and the
Abilene & Southern Railroad berm can be found on the Texas Atlas. Two rockshelters are also
included. There are four State Archaeological Landmarks in the county, including the Taylor
County Courthouse.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
Prior to the archaeological survey, the area to be impacted had been clearly delineated with survey
survey stakes (Figure 6). In Accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough
pedestrian survey of the delineated tract was conducted. Soils matrices from the six shovel tests
were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with a designed research plan, all
redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be placed
in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. Excavation of the shovel tests were terminated
either at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs), or in Pleistocene soils or fragmented bedrock
if shallower than 60 cm.

southeast).

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
The immediate area of the tower footprint area appeared to have been heavily disturbed due to
previous agricultural activities. Although the area was overgrown with sparsely scattered
secondary growth mesquite trees, prickly pear cacti, and occasional bunch grasses (see Figure
6), the deflated remnants of an artificially constructed farming terrace was observed running
across the southwestern corner of the PA. Scattered, rounded, as well as angular and fragmented
white limestone caliche and soft limestone pieces to softball size were common across the surface.
An occasional, but rare chert gravel piece was also observed.
In general, the six shovel tests placed within the tower’s footprint and the access entryway from
Hwy 277 (Figure 7) revealed weak red (10R4/3) coarse sandy clay in the upper 12-15 cm, with
angular limestone fragments and rounded limestone gravels to baseball size, 10% by volume. This
zone appears to represent the depth of discing and plowing. Between 15-30 cm is pink (10R8/4)
compacted sandy clay with larger, angular limestone fragments 25% by volume, along with few
12

soft calcium carbonate masses, few rounded limestone gravels to golf ball size, and few
fragmented snail shells. Below 30 cm is pinkish white (10R8/2) clay/caliche with common calcium
carbonate masses, and common angular limestone fragments over fragmented limestone bedrock
90% by volume.
The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms, are on file at Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, and are available upon request. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface or in any of the six shovel tests.

Figure 7. Location of shovel tests on the Project Area (Shovel Tests are numbered 1 thru 6).

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the Project
Area was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated, with no evidence of neither prehistoric
nor historic occupation observed. Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as
currently designed by the project sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect”
on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed
without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds

13

are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant,
and by the Texas Historical Commission.
