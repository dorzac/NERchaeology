ABSTRACT
On January 18-19, 22-23, and 29, 2007, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey investigation at an 80 tract near Clear Creek, in southeast
Harris County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify cultural
materials, sites, or historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding any identified resources. The investigations were
conducted for Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. (Berg Job No. 6390P), under Texas Historical
Commission Section 106 guidelines, in anticipation of the submission of a permit application to
the U.S. Corps of Engineers, Galveston District. n intensive pedestrian field survey of the project
area was conducted, and included both surface and subsurface (shovel test) examination. A total
of 62 shovel tests and two 50 x 50 cm units were excavated. The survey determined that
significant portions of the tract have been disturbed by previous agricultural and industrial-related
impacts. These include areas of mechanical scraping and imported fill, a natural gas pipeline and
associated gravel road, artificial drainage canal, pipeline, and pond, livestock pen, and a brick
feature possibly related to water divergence or livestock maintenance. No evidence of
archeological or historic remains was identified by any of the shovel tests or surface inspection.
The two hand excavation units produced an assortment of modern debris in Levels 1-3, and a
single archaic projectile point was recovered from Level 5 of Unit 2. The point most likely
represents an isolated find and is unrelated to any prehistoric occupation. At the end of the
project, the modern debris will be discarded and the projectile point will be included within the
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., artifact type collection. Consequently, no further
archeological investigations are recommended. In the event that archeological deposits or
features should be encountered during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity
and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

INTRODUCTION
gas?) located near the center of the property,
as well as its access road of crushed shell
and gravel. In the western half of the tract, a
visible layer of fill, up to 3 m in depth, was
used to level the edge of the pasture where
the natural topography began descending
down to the creek. In other parts of the
pasture,
areas
had
been
recently
mechanically scraped and graded. Along
the eastern edge of the tract is an artificial
canal which drains into a rectangular bermed
pond. The pond is drained to the south by a
partially
buried
concrete
pipe,
approximately 30 cm in diameter. These
drainage features are most likely related to
the areaâs agricultural usage (e.g., rice
farming). The canal is depicted as early as
the 1932 Genoa Quad, USGS map (which
has since been renamed Friendswood).
Additional agricultural features include a
modern barbed wire livestock enclosure and
associated collapsed tin shed near the tractâs
northern boundary, as well as a U-shaped
brick feature near the center of the small
drainage (see below).

On January 18-19, 22-23, and 29,
2007, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation at an 80 tract near Clear Creek,
in southeast Harris County, Texas. The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials, sites, or
historic properties within the proposed
impact area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 06127) were conducted for Berg Oliver
Associates, Inc. (Berg Job No. 6390P),
under Texas Historical Commission Section
106 guidelines, in anticipation of the
submission of a permit application to the
U.S. Corps of Engineers, Galveston District.
The project area is depicted on the
Friendswood, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The project is in
preparation for residential subdivision
development. The tract is irregularly shaped,
but is bounded on the north by Grissom
Road and o the east by Massengail Road and
by previously established residential
properties.
The southern edge of the
property is located approximately 100 m
from Clear Creek. Near the center of the
tract, a deeply incised drainage runs northsouth and drains into Clear Creek. Much of
the eastern half of the tract is heavily
wooded, while the western half is open
pasture. Numerous small pimple mounds
were located across much of the property.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figure 3; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of 62 shovel
tests and two 50 x 50 cm hand units were
excavated. The field investigations were
conducted by project archeologist Randy
Ferguson and field technicians John Moretti
and Darren Schubert. Roger G. Moore
served as the projectâs principal investigator.

Previous disturbances include a
gravel pad and utility junctions (natural

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Hydrology
The southern boundary of the
project area is located approximately 100 m
north of Clear Creek. Clear Creek rises in
Fort Bend County and flows east for a total
of 41 miles before emptying into Galveston
Bay. For a portion of its course it forms the
boundary between Harris, Brazoria, and
Galveston Counties.

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. San Jacinto
County is situated within the pine-oak
subdivision of the Austroriparian province
(Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the
dominant floral species of the pine-oak
forest subdivision as loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus
stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandica). Hardwood forests are found
on lowlands within the Austroriparian and
are characterized by such trees as sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa
sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra), and
other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as
well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss
(Tillandisia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal
glabra).

The project area is depicted on sheet
139 of the Soil Survey of Harris County
(Wheeler 1976). The principal soil type
present in the tract is Bernard clay loam
(Bd). In addition, a narrow strip of Lake
Charles clay, 1 to 3 percent slope (LcB) is
present in the area adjacent to Clear Creek.
Bernard clay loam soils are identified as
somewhat poorly drained with slow runoff
(Wheeler 1976:12). Lake Charles clay soils
are identified as somewhat poorly drained
with medium runoff (Wheeler 1976:19).
Abbott (2001) defines both soils as upland
ancient (pre-Holocene) alluvium, with a low
potential for containing prehistoric sites.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,

Climate
The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).

common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus

Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail

(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)
may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated
economic development of the county, and of
the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a

the second decade of the 20th century, the
growing gas and oil industry was competing

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in the project area.
However, there are three sites located within
its immediate vicinity (Â½ km). These
include two prehistoric occupation sites,
41GV103 and 41GV104, that are located
approximately 300-350 south of the current
tract, and one historic farmstead site,
41HR830, which is located approximately
500 west of the property.

The most extensive survey of the
creek was conducted by the Texas
Archaeological Survey (McGuff and Cox
1973) in preparation for massive flood
control project that would enlarge and
rectify most of the streamcourse. The
project examined almost the entire length of
the creek, covering from just west of the
Fort Bend/Brazoria County line, all the way
to Galveston Bay. A total of 76 prehistoric
and 2 historic sites were identified. They
noted a bimodal distribution of sites
(McGuff and Cox 1973:2, Figure 1), with
concentrations located in the lower reaches
of the creek near Clear Lake (between miles
2-5), and in the upper reaches (between
miles 23-28). This latter group of sites was
located on terraces alongside an incise
meander, and consisted of 41 pimple mound
sites and four terrace sites (McGuff and Cox
1973:18-19). They reported that no sites
were located west of this concentration,
though they attributed this lack to previous
channelization. A similar lack of occupation
for the upper portion of Clear Creek has
been reported by Howard et al. (1992).
They identified three types of sites (shell
middens, terrace sites, natural mound sites)
that corresponded to topographic and
environmental zones mapped along the
creek. Based on their geomorphological
assessment of the Clear Creek waterway,
there is an implication that the lack of sites
in the upper reaches is due more to the
relatively steep nature of the stream profile,
and the resultant increased surface erosion
(Howard et al. 1992:4).

The earliest work in the Clear Creek
area was conducted by avocational
archeologists during the 1950s (from
Howard et al. 1992). During the late 1960s,
a professional survey was conducted by the
Texas Archaeological Salvage Project
(Corbin and Hester 1968). The survey,
which was limited to the lower portion of
the stream, located 10 sites in Galveston
County. Beginning in the early 1970s, a
series of efforts by the Houston
Archeological Society examined a number
of locations in the region around Clear
Creek, and included both survey and
excavations at a number of sites (Aten et al.
1976; Chaffin-Lohse 1978; Hole 1974).

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
associated collapsed tin shed near the tractâs
northern boundary, as well as a U-shaped
brick feature near the center of the small
drainage (see below).

The fieldwork was conducted on
January 18-19, 22-23, and 29, 2007, and
consisted of a 100% pedestrian survey that
included systematic shovel testing and
visual examination for surface exposure of
cultural materials.

A total of 62 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through Â¼â mesh (Figure 3;
Appendix 1). Each of the projectâs shovel
tests were recorded and plotted on the
project map. The tests were placed at
intervals of approximately 50 m along each
bank of the small drainage and along the
tractâs southern boundary close to Clear
Creek.
The interval was increased to
approximately 100 m in the remainder of the
property. A number of these tests were
placed on the visible pimple mounds.

The project area is depicted on the
Friendswood, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The project is in
preparation for residential subdivision
development. The tract is irregularly shaped,
but is bounded on the north by Grissom
Road and o the east by Massengail Road and
by previously established residential
properties.
The southern edge of the
property is located approximately 100 m
from Clear Creek. Near the center of the
tract, a deeply incised drainage runs northsouth and drains into Clear Creek. Much of
the eastern half of the tract is heavily
wooded, while the western half is open
pasture (Figures 5, 6). Several small pimple
mounds were present in portions of the
property.

Of the 62 total shovel tests, 49 were
able to reach what appeared to be intact
ancient (pre-Holocene) subsoils (see
Appendix 1). No prehistoric or historic
cultural materials were found in any of the
shovel tests.

Previous disturbances include a
gravel pad and utility junctions (electricity,
gas?) located near the center of the property,
as well as its access road of crushed shell
and gravel (Figure 7). In the western half of
the tract, a visible layer of fill, up to 3 m in
depth, was used to level the edge of the
pasture where the natural topography began
descending down to the creek. In other parts
of the pasture, areas had been recently
mechanically scraped and graded. Along
the eastern edge of the tract is an artificial
canal which drains into a rectangular bermed
pond. The pond is drained to the south by a
partially
buried
concrete
pipe,
approximately 30 cm in diameter. These
drainage features are most likely related to
the areaâs agricultural usage (e.g., rice
farming). The canal is depicted as early as
the 1932 Genoa Quad, USGS map (which
has since been renamed Friendswood).
Additional agricultural features include a
modern barbed wire livestock enclosure and

Brick Feature
During the survey, a U-shaped brick
feature was identified on the west bank of
the small interior drainage (Figures 3-4, 810). The feature measures 2.40 m in length,
1.10 m in width. It rises in six courses to a
height of 60 cm above the modern ground
surface. The featureâs open end faces south.
However, the two ends of the side wall
sections are not finished and have several
bricks out of place, making it unclear
whether the feature had been constructed
with an open ended, or as a complete
rectangular enclosure. No other visible
features or constructions were located
nearby, and the function of the brick feature
was not immediately clear. Consequently,
two 50 x 50 cm units were excavated, one
(Unit 1) inside the feature and one (Unit 2)
placed outside. The units were excavated in
arbitrary 10 cm levels and the matrix
screened though Â¼â mesh. Forms were
completed for each level of each excavation

sediments had buried the lowest two courses
of brick.

unit. The purpose of the excavation was to
determine whether the soils inside and
outside the feature were intact, or whether
the brick construction was associated with
some form of subsurface disturbance or
subsurface feature (e.g., rubbish pit, grave,
cellar, etc.). Unit 1 reached a total depth of
70 cm, while Unit 2 was excavated to a
depth of 80 cm.

The uppermost 30 cm (Levels 1-3)
of both units contained modern debris that
included brick and mortar fragments,
unidentified metal fragments, and a
whiteware shard. The feature appears to be
a modern agricultural landscape feature,
most likely the foundation for a pump or
livestock watering trough associated with
the small nearby drainage. The modern
artifacts recovered from the two units will
be discarded once the project is completed.

Prior to excavation, the visible
portion of the brick feature consisted of six
intact courses and a small section of a
seventh course. The excavations determined
that the lowest portion of the brick feature
had been buried up to the top of the second
course of bricks, and revealed a total intact
height of 80 cm in nine courses. The
presence of several large fragments of intact
mortared brick were scattered around the
feature suggest that the feature may have
consisted of up to 10-15 courses when
originally constructed.

Isolated Find
A single dart point was recovered
from Level 5 (46 cmbs) in Unit 2 (Figure
11). The point appears to be a wide-bladed,
corner-notched archaic point. Though the
stem is broken off, the point may be
classified as an Epps, a Southeast Texas
point type that dates to ca. 1500-500 B.C.
As no other prehistoric artifacts were
recovered from any of the shovel tests,
excavation units, or surface exposures, the
artifact appears to be an isolated find.
Consequently, it is proposed that at the
conclusion of the project, the artifact will be
included in the Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., artifact type collection.

The two excavation units also
determined that the soils both inside and
outside the feature were intact, and the
feature was not associated with any
subsurface feature or even constructionrelated disturbance (i.e., no construction
trench). It thus appears that the feature had
been constructed directly atop the ground
surface, and that a slow deposition of

RECOMMENDATIONS
On January 18-19, 22-23, and 29,
2007, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation at an 80 tract near Clear Creek,
in southeast Harris County, Texas. The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials, sites, or
historic properties within the proposed
impact area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 06127) were conducted for Berg Oliver
Associates, Inc. (Berg Job No. 6390P),
under Texas Historical Commission Section
106 guidelines, in anticipation of the
submission of a permit application to the
U.S. Corps of Engineers, Galveston District.

gravel road, artificial drainage canal,
pipeline, and pond, livestock pen, and a
brick feature possibly related to water
divergence or livestock maintenance. No
evidence of archeological or historic
remains was identified by any of the shovel
tests or surface inspection. The two hand
excavation units produced an assortment of
modern debris in Levels 1-3, and a single
archaic projectile point was recovered from
Level 5 of Unit 2. The point most likely
represents an isolated find and is unrelated
to any prehistoric occupation. At the end of
the project, the modern debris will be
discarded and the projectile point will be
included within the Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., artifact type collection.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination. A total of 62
shovel tests and two 50 x 50 cm units were
excavated. The survey determined that
significant portions of the tract have been
disturbed by previous agricultural and
industrial-related impacts. These include
areas of mechanical scraping and imported
fill, a natural gas pipeline and associated

Consequently,
no
further
archeological
investigations
are
recommended.
In the event that
archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.
