MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by H4 WR, LP to conduct an
intensive cultural resources inventory and assessment for the proposed Wolf Ranch 4A Trail
Project in Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would consist of
constructing an approximately 3.0-meter- (10.0-foot-) wide hike-and-bike trail and an associated
maintenance trail extending from the Interstate Highway (IH) 35 southbound frontage road rightof-way (ROW) westward along the northern terraces of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River.
For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the project area was assumed to consist of 1.4kilometer- (0.9-mile-) long hike-and-bike trail and 0.3-kilometer- (0.2-mile-) long maintenance
access trail rights-of-way (ROW), covering a total linear distance of 1.7 kilometers (1.1 miles).
Permanent and temporary construction easements are assumed to measure no more than
50.0 feet in width, and the project area would cover a total area of 2.7 hectares (6.7 acres).
The proposed project is being sponsored by H4 WR, LP, a privately owned developer, on
privately owned land. In the future, following completion of construction, the trail would be deeded
to the City of Georgetown. Ordinarily, the involvement of a political subdivision of the state of
Texas triggers the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resources Code
of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191). While the City of Georgetown is not currently actively involved in
the project as a sponsor, source of funding, or landowner, the cultural resources survey was
nevertheless conducted under the auspices of the Antiquities Code of Texas pending the
involvement of the City of Georgetown as the future owner of the trail easement. The cultural
resources survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8584. The project may also
require the use of Nationwide Permits (NWP) issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE), Fort Worth District. As the USACE is a federal agency, those portions of the overall
project area that fall under the purview of federal permits would also fall under the jurisdiction of
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). As the project represents a publicly
sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor is required to provide the applicable federal agencies
and the Texas Historical Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic Preservation
Office (SHPO) for the state of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on the project’s
potential to adversely affect historic properties listed on or considered eligible for designation as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas and for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under the NHPA.

Management Summary

On October 8 to 9, 2018, Horizon archeologists Jacob Lyons and Rachel Naasz, under
the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural
resources survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the 1.7-kilometer- (1.1mile-) long project area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and
historic-age cultural resources. The project area traverses the gravelly northern terraces of the
South Fork of the San Gabriel River in the City of Georgetown. Vegetation consists of pecan,
cedar, honey locust, mesquite, oak, prickly pear, greenbrier, mustang grape vines, dewberry
vines, wild onions, and thorny brush. Visibility of the modern ground surface was fair to excellent
across most of the project area (30 to 100%). Extensive exposures of limestone bedrock and
decomposing limestone gravels are present on the modern ground surface across the project
area, and only a thin veneer of sediment is present overlying bedrock or dense clay subsoil in
most areas.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear project areas per
30.5-meter (100.0-foot) width of ROW. Thus, a minimum of 18 shovel tests would be required
within the 1.7-kilometer- (1.1-mile-) long project area. Horizon excavated a total of 53 shovel tests
during the survey, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this size.
The pedestrian survey and shovel testing revealed shallow gravelly clay sediments overlying
limestone bedrock.
Two archeological sites were recorded during the survey, including one previously
recorded site (41WM555) and one newly recorded site (41WM1401). Site 41WM555 consists of
a low-density surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic debris, a crude biface, a bifacially retouched
secondary flake, and a dart point that may represent a heavily reworked Bell or Andice point. The
presence of the possible Bell/Andice point suggests an Early Archaic period occupation. No
evidence of a burned rock midden described on the site in 1984 when the site was originally
recorded was observed. Aboriginal cultural materials observed on site 41WM555 are constrained
entirely to the eroded modern ground surface of the gravelly northern terrace of the South Fork
of the San Gabriel River and possess minimal research potential. Based on the lack of integrity
of archeological deposits, the portion of site 41WM555 within the current project area is
recommended as non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the site for inclusion in the NRHP
and for designation as an SAL. No further archeological investigations are warranted on the
portion of site 41WM555 located within the current project area.
Site 41WM1401 consists of a multiple-component aboriginal and historic-age surface and
shallow subsurface artifact scatter. Aboriginal cultural resources consist of a crude biface, a
utilized flake, and 10 to 20 tertiary flakes. Historic-age debris includes wire nails, unidentified
pieces of metal scrap, pewter/tin buttons, ceramic insulators, a copper or brass bullet casing, and
shards of aqua and green glass. Site 41WM1401 is situated at the mouth of a small, erosional
tributary where it opens up onto the northern terraces of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River,
and observed cultural materials may have been washed down from the uplands to the north and
west. Historical US Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps dating from 1928 and 1945
show a single structure, possibly a house, located at the end of a two-track road approximately

vi

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
Proposed 1.2-Mile-Long Wolf Ranch 4A Trail, Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas

100.0 meters (328.0 feet) north of the site. This structure no longer appears on USGS maps
dating from 1951 onwards or on aerial photographs dating from 1962 onwards. The historic-age
cultural materials on site 41WM1401 likely represent either domestic debris that washed down
into the gully where they were observed from the former domicile to the north or a dump of
domestic debris. Historic-age cultural materials are generally diagnostic of the early to mid-20th
century, though the aboriginal cultural materials are datable only to an undetermined prehistoric
timeframe. Based on the lack of integrity of archeological deposits, site 41WM1401 is
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No further
archeological investigations are warranted on site 41WM1401.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for inclusion in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as SALs according
to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further
archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However,
human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety
Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery,
and the THC should be notified immediately.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by H4 WR, LP to conduct an
intensive cultural resources inventory and assessment for the proposed Wolf Ranch 4A Trail
Project in Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would consist of
constructing an approximately 3.0-meter- (10.0-foot-) wide hike-and-bike trail and an associated
maintenance trail extending from the Interstate Highway (IH) 35 southbound frontage road rightof-way (ROW) westward along the northern terraces of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River.
For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the project area was assumed to consist of 1.4kilometer- (0.9-mile-) long hike-and-bike trail and 0.3-kilometer- (0.2-mile-) long maintenance
access trail rights-of-way (ROW), covering a total linear distance of 1.7 kilometers (1.1 miles).
Permanent and temporary construction easements are assumed to measure no more than
50.0 feet in width, and the project area would cover a total area of 2.7 hectares (6.7 acres)
(Figures 1 to 3).
The proposed project is being sponsored by H4 WR, LP, a privately owned developer, on
privately owned land. In the future, following completion of construction, the trail would be deeded
to the City of Georgetown. Ordinarily, the involvement of a political subdivision of the state of
Texas triggers the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resources Code

On October 8 to 9, 2018, Horizon archeologists Jacob Lyons and Rachel Naasz, under
the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural
resources survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. The cultural resources investigation consisted of an
archival review, an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area, and the production of a report
suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
The cultural resources survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8584.
Following this introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the environmental and
cultural backgrounds, respectively, of the project area. Chapter 4.0 describes the results of
background archival research, and Chapter 5.0 discusses cultural resources survey methods.
Chapter 6.0 presents the results of the cultural resources survey, and Chapter 7.0 presents
cultural resources management recommendations for the project. Chapter 8.0 lists the
references cited in the report, and Appendix A summarizes shovel test data.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located on the gravelly northern terraces of the South Fork of the San
Gabriel River in the City of Georgetown in central Williamson County, Texas. Williamson County
is situated near the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain in Central Texas and close to the
common junction of three significant physiographic provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain, the
Edwards Plateau, and the Blackland Prairie (Hill 1901; Hill and Vaughn 1900; Johnson 1931:125).
The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone between the Edwards Plateau to the west
and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band along
the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to
the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and poor
drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle gradients.
The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that
arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone
bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked
by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the
entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology,
soil, vegetation, and animal life.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is a roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in central and
north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and Colorado rivers ranging in elevation from
230.0 to 400.0 meters (754.4 to 1,312.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut
Plain forms a limestone upland that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its tributaries,
resulting in landforms characterized by generally rounded uplands cut by moderately broad,
shallow valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and supports a mixed savanna flora,
whereas soil is moderately deep in valley floors, where it supports mixed riparian woodlands and
forests. Karst features include sinks, caves, and rockshelters, but such are neither common nor
extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but not widespread across the Lampasas Cut Plain
and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the study area is situated within the Brazos River basin. The project area
is located on the gravelly northern terraces of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River. Two
unnamed tributaries of the South Fork cross the western portion of the project area, and two

H177-180235

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

springs arise at the base of the bluffs that frame the South Fork valley and flow across the project
area into the river. The South Fork of the San Gabriel River flows eastward into the main body of
the San Gabriel River north of Georgetown, which in turn flows generally eastward to its
confluence with the Little River in Milam County. The Little River, in turn, flows a short distance
eastward and empties into the Brazos River. The Brazos River flows southeastward across the
Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short
distance northeast of East Matagorda Bay.
Elevations within the project area range from approximately 213.4 to 242.3 meters
(700.0 to 795.0 feet) amsl. Drainage within the project area is to the southeast toward the South
Fork of the San Gabriel River.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the project area is situated on the Lower Cretaceous Edwards Limestone, a
member of the Fredericksburg Group (Barnes 1995). This geological formation is composed of
limestone, dolomite, and chert deposits. The chert deposits associated with the Edwards
Formation were extensively exploited by the aboriginal inhabitants of Central Texas.
Geomorphologically, the project area is situated on four specific soil types (Table 1; Figure 4).
Soils within the project area consist predominantly of a mix of gravelly residuum weathered in situ
from underlying limestone bedrock and remnants of Pleistocene-age alluvial terraces. Holoceneage Oakalla soils are present on the southern side of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River and
Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) soil maps depict this soil unit extending to the

northern side of the South Fork floodplain; however, no residual soils were observed on the gravel
terrace bench that characterizes the project area on the northern side of the river during the
survey. As such, no Holocene-age soils are present within the project area.
In Central Texas, aboriginal archeological sites are commonly located adjacent to streams
as well as in upland environments. The physiographic setting of the project area on a series of
gravel terrace benches and upland formations adjacent to the South Fork of the San Gabriel River
suggests that the project area possesses high potential for aboriginal cultural resources. The
antiquity of the limestone uplands and gravelly terrace soils suggest that any aboriginal cultural
resources present within the project area would be present on the modern ground surface or in
very shallowly buried subsurface contexts in eroded settings lacking integrity.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was considerably
cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was more heavily
forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late
Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying
trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by
grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period,
the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable. The deciduous forests
had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming
trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there
appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to
5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental
conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Williamson County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in western
Williamson County. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (32.0 inches) and
temperature averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest
month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods

lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30.5 to 63.5 centimeters (12.0 to
25.0 inches), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to 127.0 cm (45.0 to 50.0 inches)
of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall (Baker
1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain that fell
within an 18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9-cm
(22.0-inch) deluge that fell in less than three hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker
1975). Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal
storms pass so frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upperlevel winds from west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the
available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer,
cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal
convective storms.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits
of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as
“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through western
Williamson County in the vicinity of the project area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird. Reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat snake, eastern
hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake, copperhead, western
diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog, diamondback water snake,
Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and antelope were common during
the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are no longer native to this region
(Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region. The indigenous
human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle
throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North America, mobility and
settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (9,200 TO 6,000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011, 2018).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (9,200 to 6,000 B.C.) (Black 1989). This stage coincided with ameliorating
climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the extinction of
herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods within this
stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate projectile
points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and bone
foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central Texas are
known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of
plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little
evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in
North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced
throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2
periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These include the Early
PaleoIndian Period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points (i.e., Clovis,

H177-180235

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which is
characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6,000 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic stage
(6,000 B.C. to A.D. 800). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation
of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less pronounced in Central
Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the big game
populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base composed of
smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this hunting and gathering pattern is
characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the
development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of
projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater diversity
during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. In
Central Texas, the Early Archaic subperiod extends from 6,000 to 3,000 B.C., the Middle Archaic
subperiod extends from 3,000 to 1,000 B.C., and the Late Archaic subperiod covers the
1,000 B.C. to A.D. 800 timeframe. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as
markers differentiating these subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as
well. Perhaps most markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod,
continuing into the Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic
subperiod. In addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered
to constitute evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least
partially accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 800 TO 1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 to 1600) (Black 1989) is defined by the
appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north who
lacked the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1600 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed
South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay. However,

14

180235_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
Proposed 1.2-Mile-Long Wolf Ranch 4A Trail, Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas

European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The first half of
the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as the first
effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social systems.
This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data suggest population
declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased participation on the part of the
Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement of Texas began in
the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished.
The earliest known historical occupants of Williamson County were the Tonkawa Indians.1
The Tonkawa traditionally followed buffalo herds on foot and periodically set fire to the prairie to
aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, however, they made the transition to a horsebased culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Decimated by European diseases and by
warfare with the Cherokee and Comanche, the Tonkawa were generally friendly toward the early
settlers of Williamson County but were nevertheless removed from Central Texas by the 1850s.
Lipan Apaches and Comanches were also associated with the area that would become
Williamson County. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Lipan Apaches ranged
through the western part of present Williamson County, and, after Spanish missions were
established on the San Gabriel River in the 18th century, the Indians frequently raided the
missions for horses. Their enemies, the Comanches, arrived in the area in the 18th century and
lived in parts of the territory of Williamson County until as late as 1838. After they were crowded
out by Anglo settlers, the Comanches continued to raid settlements in the county until the 1860s.
There also appear to have been small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and Mayeye
Indians living in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.
While Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have traveled through the area in the 16th
century, it was probably first explored by Europeans in the late 17th century, when Capt. Alonso
De León sought a route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas that would
serve as a drier alternative to the more southerly Camino Real. The new route passed through
the area of Williamson County along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River and was called
Camino de Arriba. In 1716, two explorers in the Spanish service, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis
and Domingo Ramón, led an expedition that passed through the area and camped on Brushy
Creek and the San Gabriel River, naming them respectively Arroyo de las Bendítas Ánimas and
Rio de San Xavier. The San Xavier missions, which were founded in the mid-18th century and
occupied a series of sites along the San Gabriel River, were just across the eastern border of
Williamson County in present-day Milam County, and the area was extensively explored by the
Spanish. During the Mexican period, parts of the county were awarded as land grants, first to
several Mexican families, then as part of Robertson’s colony, but no settlement resulted from
these grants.
Anglo settlement began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic
of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835, in an attempt to strengthen the
frontier against Indian attack, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy Creek in

what would become southwestern Williamson County and was named for Capt. John J.
Tumlinson, Jr., the commander of the company of Texas Rangers who garrisoned the post. The
post was abandoned in February of 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the
Mexican invasion. In 1838, the first civilian settlement was established by Dr. Thomas Kenney
and a party of settlers who built a fort, named Kenney’s Fort, on Brushy Creek near the site of the
present-day crossing of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Several other sites on Brushy
Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept Anglo settlement in check, and a number of
the early pioneers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians over the next few years.
In 1842, many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised
settlers to pull back from the frontier. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx of
settlers who came to Texas after its annexation traveled to the frontier along Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. By 1848, there were at least 250 settlers in what was then western Milam
County, and in the early months of that year 107 of them signed a petition to organize a new
county. Recognizing that the petitioners needed a seat of local government that was considerably
closer to them than Milam County, the Texas legislature established Williamson County on 13
March 1848, naming it for prominent judge and soldier Robert M. Williamson. Georgetown, the
county seat, was laid out during the summer of that year, and the district court was in session by
October. According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a population of 1,379 Anglos
and 155 slaves living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel. As was
common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage was used to grow corn. Three
families owned 15 or more slaves in 1850, but family farms and subsistence agriculture remained
the norm prior to the Civil War. While most of the settlers had moved to Texas from other southern
states, particularly Tennessee, a substantial contingent came from Vermilion County, Illinois, and
this latter group remained pro-Union and Republican in its political orientation during the
secession crisis.
On the eve of the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage and
was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. The Anglo population tripled between 1850 and
1860 to 3,638, while the slave population grew even more dramatically to 891, six times the
number of slaves in 1850. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied and reflected the county’s
geographical diversity. Farmers used the rich Blackland soils in the eastern half of the county to
grow wheat and corn. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in
1860, and it was not an important cash crop for most farmers. The early settlers had found large
herds of wild cattle in the 1840s, and cattle ranching for both home consumption and the market
was widespread throughout the county by 1860. The number of cattle on county ranches had
more than tripled from 11,973 head in 1850 to 38,114 head in 1860. Similarly, the number of
sheep grew from 2,937 producing 3,499 pounds of wool in 1850 to 16,952 sheep and
32,994 pounds of wool in 1860.
Williamson County was marked by political divisions during the secession crisis, divisions
that were carried over into the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist sentiment was strong in
the county, and a resolution denouncing secession was adopted by a Texas Constitutional Union
party meeting in Round Rock in 1860. One of the county’s delegates to the secession convention,
Thomas Proctor Hughes, was among the 8 who voted against the ordinance of secession. When

16

180235_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
Proposed 1.2-Mile-Long Wolf Ranch 4A Trail, Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas

the ordinance was referred to a statewide election, Williamson County was one of 19 counties to
oppose it, rejecting secession by 480 to 349 votes. When the war came, most of the citizens of
Williamson County supported the Confederate cause, and at least five companies were raised in
the county: an independent “spy” company under James O. Rice, a company of Texas Rangers
for border defense under William C. Dalrymple, and companies in the Fourth, Seventh, and
Sixteenth Texas Cavalry regiments. While some of those who had opposed secession became
active Confederate supporters, others remained loyal to the Union and fled to Mexico or the North,
and a number enlisted in the Union army. In July 1863, 8 Williamson County men were caught
by Confederate troops while traveling to Mexico and were hanged near Bandera, Texas, and
other Unionists were persecuted during the war. The pattern of violence within the community
continued into the summer following the end of the war, when several men were arrested for
“flagrant crimes” and “illegal persecution of Union men.” In September 1865, a mass meeting of
the citizens of Williamson County was held on the San Gabriel River near Georgetown, and the
gathering set a general tone of reconciliation, which seems to have characterized the
Reconstruction period in Williamson County, a period that ended with the return of county
government to conservative Democratic control in 1869. Freed slaves formed several new
communities, and the county seems to have been free of much of the political and racial strife
that occurred in other Texas counties during Reconstruction. On the other hand, there was a
great deal of crime, much of it violent, in the latter 19th century. Horse and cattle thieves and
some of the more famous outlaws of the day, such as Sam Bass and John Wesley Hardin, preyed
on the property of citizens, and long-term family feuds and drunken brawls at the various saloons
in the towns added to the toll of homicides.
Though the Civil War had caused little material damage in the area, the county was a
much poorer place in 1870 than it had been in 1860. The total value of farms had fallen from
$833,418 to $389,239 and the value of livestock from $823,653 to $341,794. The economic
recovery in the 1870s was aided by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a dramatic
expansion of cotton farming. Various feeder routes to the Chisholm Trail passed through
Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed through or originated in the county from the
1860s through the early 1880s. With the coming of the railroads to the county in the 1870s,
Taylor, in the eastern part of the county, became an important rail center for the cattle trade.
Cattle-raising, after declining somewhat in importance in the early 20th century, was again a major
part of the agricultural economy by 1950, and in 1969 ranchers owned a record 65,093 cattle.
Sheep- and goat-raising followed a similar pattern. Sheep ranching recovered its pre-war level
by 1880 and peaked at 39,961 sheep and 171,752 pounds of wool in 1890, then declined in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries to 13,397 sheep and 39,458 pounds in 1920. The industry
revived in the 1930s and reached a new high of 59,919 sheep and 336,494 pounds of wool in
1959. Mohair became a significant agricultural product by 1930 and reached a peak in 1959,
when 44,668 goats produced 209,098 pounds of mohair. Cotton, the second boom industry in
Williamson County, developed at about the same time as the cattle industry. As early as 1869,
the editor of the Georgetown Watchman was advising farmers to “make cotton, but do not, by any
means, neglect the grain crop-diversity.” Cotton production, which had been insignificant before
the war, rose to successive heights of 4,217 bales in 1880, 33,945 bales in 1890, and
80,514 bales in 1900. In 1900 to 1901, Williamson County ginned more cotton than any county

H177-180235

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

in Texas except Ellis County. The number of improved acres increased almost tenfold from 1870
to 1880 and doubled again to 306,881 acres by 1890. The proportion of cropland used for cotton
production moved from about 1/3 of the total in 1880 to a high of 77% in 1910, and cotton was
grown on 73% of the cropland as late as 1930. Dramatic changes in land tenure attended the
shift to cotton production. As late as 1880, 1,183 of the 1,538 farms, or 77%, were still worked
by owners. By 1890, only 43% of the farms were operated by owners, and the percentage of
owner-operators remained at 40% until the 1920s, when it dropped still further to 29% in 1930.
Farm tenancy rates began to decline during the Great Depression with the shift away from cotton
and other staple crops and by 1959 had dropped to 36% of the county’s farmers.
Both the cattle and the cotton booms were aided by the improved communications
available in the county in the later 19th century. The International-Great Northern Railroad, which
later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific, was built across the eastern part of the county in
1876 and led to the founding of Taylor (now Williamson County’s third largest city) and Hutto and
to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened up large areas in eastern Williamson County to
commercial farming. The Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railway, which was eventually
consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway, was built in the 1880s and aided in
the development of Taylor, Granger, and Bartlett. Roads were generally poor throughout the
county in the early 20th century. There were 11,882 automobiles in the county by 1930, and
extensive improvements, including blacktopping, of all major roads took place in the 1930s.
The county also became more ethnically diverse in the later 19th and early 20th centuries.
While there were only 111 inhabitants of foreign birth out of a population of 6,368 in Williamson
County in 1870, significant numbers of Scandinavians, Germans, Czechs, Wends, and Austrians
moved to the county in the 1880s and 1890s. The proportion of foreign-born in the county
population remained at about 10% from 1890 to the 1930s. Mexican immigration reached a
significant level by about 1910, just as Europeans stopped arriving in the county. There were
294 Hispanics in 1900, 732 in 1910, and 4,967, or 11% of the population, in 1930. In 1980,
9,693 residents, or again 11%, were of Hispanic origin. The immigrants added their distinctive
customs and architectural styles to the mix of county life and introduced new religious
denominations. By the time of the Civil War, Williamson County had a number of Baptist and
Methodist churches and several different factions of the Presbyterian Church. Churches of other
denominations were built after the war, and the new emigrants established Lutheran, Catholic,
and Czech Moravian congregations. By 1930, Williamson County had a culturally diverse
population of 44,146 inhabitants. The economy was still overwhelmingly agricultural; only
29 manufacturing establishments employed 347 workers that year. While cotton production was
near its peak in terms of percentage of cropland, the cotton industry was already undergoing a
rapid transformation.
The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and the influx of the boll weevil
had already injured the profitability of the industry by the late 1920s, and the situation of cotton
growers was further worsened by the depression. The black population seems to have been
particularly hard hit by the depression. Of the 944 county families on relief in 1933, 442, almost
half, were black, though blacks constituted only 16% of the population. Various federal relief
programs benefited farmers with farm loans and subsidies, and in 1936 a total of $204,000 in

18

180235_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
Proposed 1.2-Mile-Long Wolf Ranch 4A Trail, Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas

subsidy checks was issued. The Depression encouraged diversification among farmers and a
shift away from staple crops to livestock. Between 1930 and 1940, the number of acres used for
cotton-growing fell by almost half, and cotton production went from 68,266 to 36,890 bales.
Cropland acreage used for corn production increased over the same period by about half, and
wool and mohair production more than doubled to 342,983 and 102,517 pounds, respectively.
While cotton continued to be an important crop in eastern Williamson County, farmers increasingly
turned to other crops like sorghum and wheat and to livestock-raising in the latter 20th century.
Along with such traditional livestock as sheep and cattle, poultry farming played a significant role
in the economy by 1950, when the county was fifth in the state in the production of eggs and
chickens. In 1980, it was 10th in the state in the production of turkeys.
The agricultural diversification of the middle decades of the 20th century was followed by
significant social and economic changes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The black population,
which had remained at between 15% and 18% of the total in the early and mid-20th century,
began to decline, both proportionately and in real numbers, from the 1940s on and had fallen to
4,111, or about 5%, by 1980. As in other areas of Texas, blacks were relegated to segregated
and inferior housing and educational facilities until the 1960s, when some improvements were
brought about by federal desegregation policies. Along with changes in racial composition,
Williamson County experienced a dramatic increase in population during this period, growing from
37,305 inhabitants in 1970 to an estimated 85,700 inhabitants in 1982, making it 34th in population
growth among counties in the US in the 1970s.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon performed background archival research on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) for information on previously recorded cultural
resources as well as previous cultural resources investigations conducted within and in the vicinity
of the project area. Based on this archival research, 11 previously recorded archeological sites
and two cemeteries (one of which has also been recorded as an archeological site) are present
within a 1.0-kilometer (0.6-mile) radius of the project area (Table 2; Figure 5). Ten of the 11 sites
contain aboriginal cultural components, and site types include lithic scatters, a burned rock
midden, and one possible rockshelter. Temporally diagnostic aboriginal artifacts observed on the
site suggest prehistoric occupations dating from the Archaic to protohistoric/historic periods,
though several of the sites lack temporally diagnostic artifacts and are datable only to an
undetermined prehistoric timeframe.
Two of the 11 sites contain historic-age cultural
components, including one early 20th-century house and one mid-20th-century farmstead. No
historic properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designated as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) are present within the project area or within the desktop
archival study radius.
The majority of the sites are located well beyond the boundaries of the project area and
would have no potential to be affected by the proposed undertaking. However, two of the sites—
41WM555 and 41WM1047—are located within or adjacent to the project area. Site 41WM555
was recorded in 1984 as an aboriginal lithic scatter and a large burned rock midden at the edge
of the terrace and toe slope of the adjacent uplands. The burned rock midden was described as
heavily disturbed at the time, and the landowner apparently intended to let his grandchildren dig
up the rest of the midden. The boundaries recorded for site 41WM555 are rather extensive, and
it is not clear exactly where the burned rock midden is, or was, located within the overall site. Site
41WM1047 was recorded by Horizon in 2002 during a cultural resources survey for a larger land
development project on Wolf Ranch. Cultural resources observed on the site consisted only of
two chert flakes on the modern ground surface west of the rock overhang, and it is not entirely
clear that the overhang represents an archeological site or simply a natural feature.
The majority of the project area was previously surveyed during Horizon’s initial 2002
survey of the larger Wolf Ranch tract and by a 2007 survey conducted for the City of Georgetown
for a proposed waste water interceptor pipeline.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

On October 8 to 9, 2018, Horizon archeologists Jacob Lyons and Rachel Naasz, under
the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural
resources survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the 1.7-kilometer- (1.1mile-) long project area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and
historic-age cultural resources. The project area traverses the gravelly northern terraces of the
South Fork of the San Gabriel River in the City of Georgetown. Vegetation consists of pecan,
cedar, honey locust, mesquite, oak, prickly pear, greenbrier, mustang grape vines, dewberry
vines, wild onions, and thorny brush. Visibility of the modern ground surface was fair to excellent
across most of the project area (30 to 100%). Extensive exposures of limestone bedrock and
decomposing limestone gravels are present on the modern ground surface across the project
area, and only a thin veneer of sediment is present overlying bedrock or dense clay subsoil in
most areas. An existing City of Georgetown sewer line runs adjacent to the linear project area
for most of its length (Figures 6 to 12).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear project areas per
30.5-meter (100.0-foot) width of ROW. Thus, a minimum of 18 shovel tests would be required
within the 1.7-kilometer- (1.1-mile-) long project area. Horizon excavated a total of 53 shovel tests
during the survey, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this size
(Figures 13 to 14). The pedestrian survey and shovel testing revealed shallow gravelly clay
sediments overlying limestone bedrock. Shovel tests measured approximately 30 centimeters
(11.8 inches in diameter and typically revealed shallow gravelly clay sediments overlying
limestone bedrock or gravels derived from decomposing bedrock at depths ranging from 10.0 to
30.0 centimeters (3.9 to 11.8 inches) below surface. Sediments excavated from shovel tests were
screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth, and the Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all shovel tests were determined using hand-held Garmin eTrex
global positioning system (GPS) devices based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
Specific shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log
was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources. Diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and non-

diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found.
Two archeological sites were recorded during the survey, including a portion of one
previously recorded site (41WM555) and one newly recorded site (41WM1401). For each site, a
standard site recording form was used to record pertinent information on location, physiographic
setting, and local environmental characteristics; types and quantities of artifacts observed;
distribution and densities of artifacts; artificial and natural impacts; and the condition of surface
and subsurface archeological deposits. A scaled sketch map was drawn illustrating site
boundaries; locations of shovel tests, cultural features, and/or material concentrations; as well as
notable features of the landscape. Each site was thoroughly photo-documented using color digital
photography, and a photographic log was maintained of all photographs taken. Based on the
information recorded on the standard archeological site recording form in the field, a Texas
Archeological Data Site Form was completed for each newly recorded site and a Texas
Archeological Data Site Update Form was completed for each previously recorded site by
Horizon’s laboratory personnel using the most current version of TARL’s TexSite archeological
data collection software. All TexSite forms were submitted by TARL, and a permanent site
trinomial was obtained for the newly recorded site.
As discussed in the previous chapter, two previously recorded sites—41WM555 and
41WM1047—are located within or adjacent to the project area. A portion of site 41WM555 was

documented during the current survey and is described in the following chapter. However, no
evidence of site 41WM1047 was observed during the survey. When site 41WM1047 was
recorded by Horizon in 2002 during a cultural resources survey for a larger land development
project on Wolf Ranch, cultural resources observed on the site consisted only of two chert flakes
on the modern ground surface west of the rock overhang. Based on this scarce evidence, it was
not entirely clear that the overhang represented an archeological site or simply a natural feature
located in an area with a high density of prehistoric sites nearby. During Horizon’s survey for the
current project, numerous shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of the rock overhang
recorded as site 41MW1047 (Figure 15). No cultural resources were observed in the vicinity of
this feature, and it is Horizon’s current opinion that this overhang is simply a natural feature.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Two archeological sites were recorded during the survey, including one previously
recorded site (41WM555) and one newly recorded site (41WM1401) (Figure 16). Site 41WM555
consists of a low-density surface scatter of aboriginal lithic debris, a crude biface, a bifacially
retouched secondary flake, and a dart point that may represent a heavily reworked Bell or Andice
point. Site 41WM1401 consists of a multiple-component aboriginal and historic-age surface and
shallow subsurface artifact scatter. Each site is described in more detail below.

6.1

SITE 41WM555
General Description

Site 41WM555 consists of an extensive, low-density scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts on
the gravelly northern terraces of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River (Figure 17; also see
Figure 16). Site 41WM555 was originally recorded in 1984 by Ulrich Kleinschmidt as an aboriginal
lithic scatter and a large burned rock midden at the edge of the terrace and toe slope of the
adjacent uplands. The burned rock midden was described as heavily disturbed at the time,
including a trench running through its center and other evidence of looter activity. Approximately
30% of the midden remained intact at the time, and the landowner apparently intended to let his
grandchildren dig up the rest of the midden. The originally recorded boundaries of site 41WM555
are rather extensive, and it is not clear exactly where the burned rock midden is, or was, located
within the overall site. During the survey for the current project, Horizon observed a low-density
surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic debris, a crude biface, a bifacially retouched secondary flake,
and a dart point that may represent a heavily reworked Bell or Andice point within the linear Wolf
Ranch 4A Trail project area traversing site 41WM555. The portion of the site investigated by
Horizon winds across the gravelly northern terraces of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River.
An unnamed, spring-fed tributary of the San Gabriel flows southward across the site near its
western boundary. Vegetation on the site consists of pecan, cedar, honey locust, mesquite, oak,
prickly pear, greenbrier, mustang grape vines, wild onions, and various thorny underbrush. An
existing City of Georgetown sewer line runs adjacent to the linear project area for much of its
length across site 41WM555, and an overgrown two-track road descends from the nearby uplands
and crosses the site (Figures 18 to 19). Elevations across the site range from approximately
222.5 to 228.6 meters (730.0 to 750.0 feet) amsl.

Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
As delineated when the site was originally recorded in 1984, the boundaries of site
41WM555 measure approximately 340.0 meters (1,115.5 feet) east to west by 140.0 meters
(459.3 feet) north to south. The site boundaries appear to have been determined based on the
extent of the aboriginal lithic scatter observed on the modern ground surface as no subsurface
investigations are mentioned on the original site form. Horizon confirmed the presence of
aboriginal lithic artifacts on the modern ground surface within the previously recorded site
boundaries but saw no reason to modify the site boundaries.
Horizon excavated a total of 18 shovel tests within and immediately surrounding the
previously recorded boundaries of site 41WM555. Shovel testing typically revealed dense clay
and gravelly clay at the surface, though some shovel tests revealed shallow deposits of clay loam
over clay at depths down to 45.0 cmbs (17.7 inches), construction fill to a depth of 30.0 cmbs
(11.8 inches) (possibly from construction of the sewer line), and clay over limestone gravels at a
depth of 25.0 cmbs (9.8 inches). One shovel test, ST JL12, revealed sandy clay loam to
80.0 cmbs (31.5 inches) overlying limestone gravels in dense clay. No subsurface cultural
resources were observed in any of the shovel tests excavated on site 41WM555; archeological
deposits are constrained to the modern ground surface.
Observed Cultural Features
A large burned rock midden was observed on site 41WM555 at the edge of the terrace
and toe slope of the adjacent uplands when the site was originally recorded in 1984. At that time,
the burned rock midden was described as heavily disturbed, including a trench running through
its center and other evidence of looter activity. Approximately 30% of the midden remained intact
at the time, and the landowner apparently intended to let his grandchildren dig up the rest of the
midden. The location of this burned rock midden within the overall site boundaries is not clear
from the site form. No evidence of this burned rock midden or any other cultural features was
observed during Horizon’s investigations on site 41WM555.
Observed Cultural Materials
Aboriginal cultural materials observed on site 41WM555 include a low-density surficial
scatter of aboriginal lithic debris, a crude biface, a bifacially retouched secondary flake, and a dart
point that may represent a heavily reworked Bell or Andice point (Figures 20 to 22). The presence
of the possible Bell/Andice point suggests an Early Archaic period occupation, though the large
extent of the lithic scatter and former presence of a burned rock midden on the site suggests that
a broader range of occupations, possibly extending through subsequent prehistoric timeframes,
is possible. However, no other temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41WM555 consists of a low-density surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic debris, a crude
biface, a bifacially retouched secondary flake, and a dart point that may represent a heavily
reworked Bell or Andice point. The presence of the possible Bell/Andice point suggests an Early
Archaic period occupation. No evidence of a burned rock midden described on the site in 1984

when the site was originally recorded was observed. Aboriginal cultural materials observed on
site 41WM555 are constrained entirely to the eroded modern ground surface of the gravelly
northern terrace of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River and possess minimal research
potential. Based on the lack of integrity of archeological deposits, the portion of site 41WM555
within the current project area is recommended as non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the
site for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No further archeological
investigations are warranted on the portion of site 41WM555 located within the current project
area.

6.2

SITE 41WM1401
General Description

Site 41WM1401 consists of a multiple-component aboriginal and historic-age surface and
subsurface artifact scatter situated on a low terrace at the mouth of an unnamed tributary of the
South Fork of the San Gabriel River where it discharges onto the gravelly river floodplain
(Figure 23; also see Figure 16). The aboriginal component consists of a low-density surface and
shallow subsurface scatter of 10 to 20 pieces of lithic debitage, a crude biface, and a utilized flake.
The historic-age component consists of a dump or eroded, secondary deposit of 20th-century
domestic debris. Vegetation consists of Ashe juniper, greenbrier, prickly pear, honey locust,
dewberry vines, mustang grape vines, sparse short grasses, and thorny underbrush (Figure 24).
The unnamed tributary of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River forms the northern boundary

of the site (Figure 25). Elevations across this relatively small site range from approximately
222.2 to 225.9 meters (729.0 to 741.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of aboriginal and historic-age cultural materials observed on the
modern ground surface and in one subsurface shovel test, site 41WM1401 measures
approximately 80.0 meters (262.5 feet) east to west by 30.0 meters (98.4 feet) north to south.
Six shovel tests were excavated within the final delineated boundaries of site 41WM1401.
One shovel test, ST JL25, contained one chert tertiary flake at a depth of 10.0 to 20.0 centimeters
(3.9 to 7.9 inches) below surface, though cultural materials on site 41WM1401 are otherwise
constrained to the modern ground surface. Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of clay
over gravels derived from limestone bedrock at depths of 15.0 to 30.0 centimeters (5.9 to
11.8 inches) below surface.
Observed Cultural Features
No cultural features, prehistoric or historic-age, were observed on site 41WM1401.

Figure 25. Minor Tributary Stream at Northern Boundary of Site 41WM1401 (Facing East)

Observed Cultural Materials
Aboriginal cultural materials observed on site 41WM1401 consist of a low-density surface
and shallow subsurface scatter of 10 to 20 pieces of lithic debitage, a crude biface, and a utilized
biface-reduction flake (Figures 26 to 28). No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed.
f Historic-age artifacts observed on site 41WM101 include 40 to 50 wire nails, three pewter
or tin buttons, four ceramic insulators, one “30-30 WIN” ammunition casing, 5 to 10 aqua bottle
glass shards, 5 to 10 green bottle glass shards, and 10 to 20 pieces of unidentified metal scrap
(Figure 29).
Historical Research
Historical USGS topographic maps dating from 1928 and 1945 show a single structure,
possibly a house, located at the end of a two-track road approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet)
north of site 41WM1401 (NETR 2018). This structure no longer appears on USGS maps dating
from 1951 onwards or on aerial photographs dating from 1962 onwards. The historic-age cultural
materials on site 41WM1401 likely represent either domestic debris that washed down into the
gully where they were observed from the former domicile to the north or a dump of domestic
debris.

Prior to being acquired by the current landowner, H4 WR, LP, the larger parcel on which
site 41WM1401 is located (R548562) was previously under the ownership of various other
investment trusts, the Guy family, and the Knight family (WCAD 2018). Neither the Guy nor Knight
family names appear on the TSHA (2018) as being of historical importance in the history of
Williamson County.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41WM1401 consists of a multiple-component aboriginal and historic-age surface and
shallow subsurface artifact scatter. Aboriginal cultural resources consist of a crude biface, a
utilized flake, and 10 to 20 tertiary flakes. Historic-age debris includes wire nails, unidentified
pieces of metal scrap, pewter/tin buttons, ceramic insulators, a copper or brass bullet casing, and
shards of aqua and green glass. Site 41WM1401 is situated at the mouth of a small, erosional
tributary where it opens up onto the northern terraces of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River,
and observed cultural materials may have been washed down from the uplands to the north and
west. Historical USGS topographic maps dating from 1928 and 1945 show a single structure,
possibly a house, located at the end of a two-track road approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet)
north of the site. This structure no longer appears on USGS maps dating from 1951 onwards or
on aerial photographs dating from 1962 onwards. The historic-age cultural materials on site
41WM1401 likely represent either domestic debris that washed down into the gully where they
were observed from the former domicile to the north or a dump of domestic debris. Historic-age
cultural materials are generally diagnostic of the early to mid-20th century, though the aboriginal
cultural materials are datable only to an undetermined prehistoric timeframe. Based on the lack
of integrity of archeological deposits, site 41WM1401 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No further archeological investigations are warranted
on site 41WM1401.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or federal
codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a
function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs, though
historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important historic events
and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources
are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological
resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs, respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by three requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least one of the four criteria for eligibility listed
above, and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As
discussed here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory
and history according to various periods of development in various times and at various places.
Thus, the significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic
development and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular
period of development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding
of prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought
to bear for historic sites.

7.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

H177-180235

49

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

7.4

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

Two archeological sites were recorded during the survey, including one previously
recorded site (41WM555) and one newly recorded site (41WM1401) (Table 3). Site 41WM555
consists of a low-density surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic debris, a crude biface, a bifacially
retouched secondary flake, and a dart point that may represent a heavily reworked Bell or Andice
point. The presence of the possible Bell/Andice point suggests an Early Archaic period
occupation. No evidence of a burned rock midden described on the site in 1984 when the site
was originally recorded was observed. Aboriginal cultural materials observed on site 41WM555
are constrained entirely to the eroded modern ground surface of the gravelly northern terrace of
the South Fork of the San Gabriel River and possess minimal research potential. Based on the
lack of integrity of archeological deposits, the portion of site 41WM555 within the current project

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
Proposed 1.2-Mile-Long Wolf Ranch 4A Trail, Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas

area is recommended as non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the site for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No further archeological investigations are warranted on
the portion of site 41WM555 located within the current project area.
Site 41WM1401 consists of a multiple-component aboriginal and historic-age surface and
shallow subsurface artifact scatter. Aboriginal cultural resources consist of a crude biface, a
utilized flake, and 10 to 20 tertiary flakes. Historic-age debris includes wire nails, unidentified
pieces of metal scrap, pewter/tin buttons, ceramic insulators, a copper or brass bullet casing, and
shards of aqua and green glass. Site 41WM1401 is situated at the mouth of a small, erosional
tributary where it opens up onto the northern terraces of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River,
and observed cultural materials may have been washed down from the uplands to the north and
west. Historical USGS topographic maps dating from 1928 and 1945 show a single structure,
possibly a house, located at the end of a two-track road approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet)
north of the site. This structure no longer appears on USGS maps dating from 1951 onwards or
on aerial photographs dating from 1962 onwards. The historic-age cultural materials on site
41WM1401 likely represent either domestic debris that washed down into the gully where they
were observed from the former domicile to the north or a dump of domestic debris. Historic-age
cultural materials are generally diagnostic of the early to mid-20th century, though the aboriginal
cultural materials are datable only to an undetermined prehistoric timeframe. Based on the lack
of integrity of archeological deposits, site 41WM1401 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No further archeological investigations are warranted
on site 41WM1401.

7.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for inclusion in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as SALs according
to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further
archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However,
human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety
Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery,
and the THC should be notified immediately.
