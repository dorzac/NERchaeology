Some Puebloan Trade Pottery From
Panhandle Aspect Sites
MARTHA LEWIS

CRABB

ABSTRACT
Twelve types of Puebloan trade pottery were found in 5 Panhandle
Aspect village sites and two camp sites in the western ha!f of the Texas
Panhandle. Nine of these have not previously been reported for the
Panhandle Aspect. All of these pottery types apparently date between
A.D. 1200 and A.D. 1450. These dates correspond to the general dates
suggested for the Panhandle Aspect.
INTRODUCTION
From 1964 through 1967 amateur archeologists from Dumas, Texas,
collected a large number of New Mexico trade pottery sherds. The
sherds were found at 7 sites along the Canadian River and its tributaries in the western half of the Texas Panhandle.
Except for two isolated finds, the 73 sherds were found in test
excavations or on the surface of 5 village sites. Four sherds from
a collection of the National Park Service are included. The village
sites, CRla, Big Blue 1, Floyd Ranch Ruin, Ozier Ranch Ruin and
Saddleback Ruin, are each located on a bank of the Canadian River
or a tributary creek where live water exists today. Each is adjacent to
a cultivable flood plain and some timber.
Four reported Panhandle Aspect sites, one in the Oklahoma Panhandle and three in the Texas Panhandle, have produced Puebloan
trade sherds while 8 reported sites have yielded none. The Saddleback Ruin near Tascosa in Oldham County (Holden 1933) produced
about two dozen Puebloan trade sherds and 4910 cordmarked sherds.
The trade pottery was identified as Glaze I and Biscuit A which
Baen’eis and Bryson (1966) equate with Agua Fria Glaze-on-red and
Abiquiu Black-on-gray respectively. Several Puebloan sherds were
picked up from the surface at Saddleback by Floyd Hudspeth of
Amarillo, Texas, including 3 Kuaua G[aze-polychrome dated circa
A.n. 1450 and one Cieneguilla Glaze-on-yellow dated A.D. 1375-1450.
The Antelope Creek Ruin in Hutchinson County and the Alibates
Creek Ruin in Potter County (Krieger 1946) produced the following
four types: Lincoln Black-on-red, circa A.I). 1300-1400; CieneguilIa
Glaze-on-yellow, circa 1375-1450; St. ]ohns PoIychrome, circa 12001275; and Agua Fria Glaze A. Agua Fria Glaze A is equated with
Agua Fria Glaze-on-red, circa 1325-1425, by Baerreis and Bryson
(1966).

TEXAS AI~CHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Four sherds of Puebloan trade ware in a sample of 1831 sherds were
recovered at the Stamper Site, Oklahoma, type site of the Optima
Focus (Watson 1950). They were identified as Rowe Black-on-white
dating from the late 13th centm3~ and found only in a few of the
upper Peeos Valley ruins.
My sincere appreciation goes to each of the following people: Dr.
Alfred E. Dittert, Jr., former curator, Museum of New Mexico, made
this paper possible by identifying and dating the sherds. Jack T.
Hughes, Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum, gave helpful advice.
Michael Beeker, Superintendent of Sanford tleselwoir, kindly gave
permission to use the identifications contained in his letter from
Albert H. Sehroeder, National Park Service archeologist.
The sherds were found by Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Blackburn, Mr.
and Mrs. Jimmy Crabb, Mr. and Mrs. Collier Phillips, Mr. and Mrs.
Fred Squyres, Mr. and Mrs. Arehie Caven, Mr. and Mrs. Bill Smith,
Charlie Knight, and Floyd Hudspeth.

VILLAGE SITES
CRIA SITE

Cl:[la is a large, rich site directly across iRunning Water Creek south
of CI~I in Moore County, Texas (Classcock 1955). It has produced
typical Panhandle Aspect materials except that stone houses and
polished stone tools are absent. Several artifacts not reported for other
Panhandle Aspect sites found here are: eagle or hawk talons; carefully
made discoidal stones with red ocher on the flat sides; a cache of 24
end scrapers, 9 side scrapers, 6 knives, and 94 large unworked flakes;
a small animal figure, a bead, and a small flower each of fired clay.
Over half of the cordmarked rim sherds are collared. Small triangular,
bifacially-worked flakes, one to two inches long, are abundant.
The midden which lies under 19. to 94 inches of compact overburden is from 8 to 36 inches thick, averaging about 18 inches. Local
collectors have recovered hundreds of artifacts from the midden area.
Although no positive evidence of houses has been found, the site must
have been occupied permanently or intermittently by a large group
for many years. House floors, but no stone structures or foundations,
have been found in Ctll just across the creek.
Four types of Puebloan trade pottery were found at this site:
Santa Fe Black-on-white, A.D. 1225-1350
(9 sherds, 1 vessel)
Wiyo Black-on-white, A.D. 1300-1400
(8 sherds, 2 vessels)

GalisCeo Black-on-white, A.D. 1300-1325

(13 sherds, 2 vessels)
Rowe Black-on-white, A.D. 1350
(19 sherds, 2 vessels)
These types are fi’om the Rio Grande-Pecos River area of northeastern
New Mexico. The temporal range is from A.D. 1225 to 1400 with a
median date of about A.O. 1300.
BIa BLUE 1 RUIN
This village site is located in Moore County on a high promontory
overlooking the winding channel of Blue Creek and a wide floodplain.
Slabs of dolomite mark the foundations and fallen walls of two
groups of separate structures at the Big Blue 1 Ruin. A midden area
6 feet deep which is located on a shelf immediately below one group
of houses was excavated. None of the houses were excavated.
Three sherds of a CieneguilIa Glaze-on-yellow vessel dated A.D.
1375-1450 and one possible jar base sherd of Agua Fria Glaze-on-red,
A.D. 1325-1425, were found in the midden. Dates of the pottery cover
a period from A.D. 1325-1450 with a median date of around A.D. 1400.
Ozm~ RANCH RmN
This ruin is on the north side of the Canadian River between Evans
Canyon and Martins Canyon in Moore County. It is on a bench about
20 feet above the bed of the river. Formerly the river bed was one
mile across but is now covered by the waters of Lake Meredith. North
of the site a steep bluff rises nearly 9,00 feet to the leve! of the Llano
Estaeado.
This site has been almost completely wrecked by vandals. Evidence
of stone walls at least 3 feet high were observed in some of the pot
holes. The rooms were evidently in a cellular arrangement.
A large amount of Borger Cordmarked pottery and the usual stone
and bone m’tifaets were found. A sherd of Puebloan trade pottery was
described by Dittert as an anomalous specimen close to GaIisteo Blackon-white (personal communication). Other Puebloan sherds collected
by National Park Service personnel and Jack T. Hughes were identified by Dittert as Apache A.D. 1600-1700(?); Largo Glaze-on-yellow,
circa A.D. 1425; Largo Glaze-poIychrome, circa A.D. 1425 (letter from
Albert H. Schroeder to Michael Becker 1966). The late Apache sherd
is doubtless intrusive.
Evidently this site was occupied after the Panhmldle Aspect ruins
were completely covered with sand and soil as the sm’face of the site
was covered with flint chips before it was disturbed by collectors.

Disregarding the Apache sherd, the dates of the Puebloan sherds
span the years A.D. 1300 to 1425. Since the identifieation of the
Galisteo Black-on-white is questionable, A.D. 149.5 is the best date for
the trade ware at the Ozier Ranch Ruin.
FLOYD RANCH RUIN

Full-height stone-walled rooms in cellular arrangement and polished
stone axes set the Floyd Ranch Ruin apart from the other 3 Panhandle
Aspect sites investigated. Situated northwest of Amarillo on a high
bank of the Canadian River, the site offers a panoramic view of the
river and surrounding plains. Typical Panhandle Aspect materials have
been found as well as a polished stone ax of fibrolite, tm’quoise ornaments, stone artifacts of obsidian and Dakota sandstone, and corrugated cookware sherds.
The Puebloan trade sherds show a wide range of dates and sources.
Types from the Rio Crande-Pecos River area of northeastern New
Mexico are 1 sherd of Cieneguilla Glaze-on-yellow, A.D. 1375-1450; 1
sherd of Wiyo Black-on-white, A.D. 1225-1350; and i sherd of Santa
Fe Black-on-white, A.D. 129,5-1350. One sherd of Chupadero Blackon-white, A.D. 1200-1600, usually found in eastern New Mexico and
7 sherds of 1 vessel of Heshotauthla Polychrome, A.D. 1275-1375 from
western New Mexico were recovered.
Disregarding Chupadero Black-on-white, the temporal range of the
sherds is from A.D. 1225 to 1450, median date of about 1350.
ISOLATED FINDS

One sherd of Puebloan potte13z identified as Kowina Black-onwhite, A.D. 1200-1400, was found on top of a sand dune a quarter of
a mile downstream from CR1 and CRIa. This type is probably from
western New Mexico. Another sherd identified as Largo Glaze-onyellow, circa A.D. 1425, was found in a cut bank of Blue Creek near
several Panhandle Aspect sites.
The Texas sites from which trade potte13z has not been reported are
the Handley Ranch or Wolf Creek Ruin, Cottonwood Creek Ruin
(Moorehead 1931), Tarbox Creek Ruin (Holden 1930), CR1 (Glasscock 1955), the Medford Ranch, Spring Creek, and Conners sites (Duffield 1964).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Typical Panhandle Aspect materials found in association with the
sherds were Bo~’ger Cordmarked pottery; Harrel, Fresno, and Washita
projectile points; ovate and diamond-shaped beveled knives; snubnosed, side and flake scrapers; flint drills, hammerstones, choppers;
ornaments of mussel shel!, olivella shell, and of stone, bone, and
turquoise; bone hoes, rasps, awls, flaking tools, and digging stick tips;
charred maize kernels and cobs; and a great abundance of Alibates
flint chips.
Nine types of Puebloan pottery found at Panhandle Aspect sites are
added to the six types already reported. The fifteen types of trade
pottery include: Agua Fria Glaze-on-red, C ieneguilla Glaze-on-yellow,
Abiquiu Black-on-gray, Lincoln Black-on-red, St. ]ohns PoIychrome,
Rowe Black-on-white, Chupadero Black-on-white, GaIisCeo Black-onwhite, Heshotau,thla Polychrome, Kowina Black-on-white, Kuaua
Glaze-polychrome, Largo Glaze-polychrome, Largo Glaze-on-yellow’
Santa Fe Black-on-white, Wiyo Black-on-white.
While the maiority of the types are from the Rio Grande-Pecos River
area of northeastern New Mexico, it is interesting to note that Kowina
Black-on-white and Heshotauthla Polychrome are from western New
Mexico. These two western New Mexico types have a temporal span
of 200 years from A.D. 1200 to 1400. While the 12 types (shown in
Table 1) span 400 years from A.D. 1200 to 1600, all were being produced within the period from A.D. 1250 to 1450.
CRla with a median date of about A.D. 1300 seems to be the oldest
of the village sites here reported. It has yielded no evidence of rock
structures or foundations. Big Blue 1 with a median date of around
A.D. 1400 is a village of separate house ruins. Ozier Ranch with a
median date of A.D. 1425 is, beyond reasonable doubt, a village of
contiguous stone-walled rooms. It would appear, from the pottery
dates, that Ozier is the latest of the sites.
Although CRla, Big Blue 1, and Ozier Ranch fall into a neat
chronological pattern of early dates with no rock structures, middle
dates with individual houses, and late dates with contiguous rockwalled rooms, the Floyd Ranch site does not fit the pattern so nicely.
The dates of the Puebloan pottery found at Floyd Ranch range from
A.D. 1225 to 1450 with a median date of between A.D. 1350 and 1375.
The rooms at this site are definitely of cellular arrangement with stone
wa!ls to the full height of the rooms. The site is considerably closer to
the New Mexico Pueblo region than the others, and the corrugated
cookware, polished stone axes and hoes, turquoise ornaments, and use
of obsidian and Dakota sandstone indicate more Puebloan influence.

It is suggested that the people at the Floyd Ranch site were being
subjected to earlier or greater influences from the western Pueblos,
which would account for the appearance of contiguous roomed houses
at the slightly earlier date.
The dates of the Puebloan pottery here reported correspond with
the cm’bon 14 date detelTninations of A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1500 reported
by Baerries and Bryson (1966). The dates also correspond with the
dating of the Panhandle Aspect as discussed by Krieger (1946).
