MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by CP&Y, Inc. (CP&Y) on
behalf of the San Antonio River Authority (SARA) to conduct a cultural resources inventory survey
and assessment for the proposed Martinez IV Project 4 24-Inch Sanitary Sewer Line Project. The
proposed undertaking would involve construction of an approximately 1.6-kilometer- (1.0-mile-)
long 24-inch-diameter sanitary sewer pipeline and the decommissioning of an existing lift station.
The project area is located off the southern side of the eastbound Interstate Highway (IH) 10
frontage road roughly 1.4 kilometers (0.9 mile) east of its intersection with Farm-to-Market Road
(FM) 1604. For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the project area is assumed to consist
of a linear pipeline right-of-way measuring 1.6 kilometers (1.0 mile) in length by no more than
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width, covering an area of approximately 4.4 hectares (10.9 acres).
Based on available construction plans, the vertical depth of impacts would range from 3.0 to
7.6 meters (10.0 to 25.0 feet) below surface.
The proposed undertaking would be sponsored by SARA, a political subdivision of the
state of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of
Texas. In addition, portions of the study area fall within the corporate boundaries of the City of
San Antonio (CoSA); as such, the project may be subject to review by the CoSA’s Office of
Historic Preservation (OHP) under CoSA’s Historic Preservation and Design Section of the
Unified Development Code (Article 6, Sections 35-630, Designated Archaeological Sites, to 35634, Cemeteries). At this time, no federal jurisdiction has been identified for the project. The
Antiquities Code of Texas states that the applicable state agencies and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the State
of Texas, must be afforded the opportunity to comment when any historic properties that are
designated as or considered eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) are
present in a project area affected by stage agency actions or covered under federal and/or state
permits or funding.
On July 31, 2019, Horizon archeologists Jesse O. Dalton and Mckinzie Froese conducted
an intensive cultural resources survey of the project area. The survey was conducted under the
overall direction of Jahleen E. Sefton, Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 8914. The purpose of the survey was to locate any significant cultural resources that
potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the
project area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age

cultural resources. The project area is situated on the upland and floodplain terraces of Salitrillo
Creek, which skirts the northeastern corner of the project area. The project area crosses tracts
of primarily undeveloped land consisting of short to tall grasses, which typically afforded poor
visibility of the modern ground surface (<20%). Two driveways exit off the southeastern side of
the IH 10 frontage road, crossing the project area and providing access to existing commercial
and industrial facilities to the south.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1.0 mile) per 30.5meter (100.0-foot) width of linear right-of-way (ROW), or fraction thereof. In addition, for blockarea projects, the TSMASS call for excavation of three shovel tests per acre for project areas
measuring 0.8 hectare (2.0. acres) or less in size. As such, a minimum of 16 shovel tests would
be required within the proposed 1.6-kilometer- (1.0-mile-) long linear sewer line ROW. Horizon
excavated a total of 16 shovel tests during the survey, thereby meeting the TSMASS
requirements for a project area of this size. Shovel testing typically revealed dense, blocky black
clay on the modern ground surface and extending to the maximum depths of shovel tests at
depths ranging from 30.0 to 45.0 centimeters (11.8 to 17.7 inches) below surface. It is Horizon’s
opinion that sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits were fully
penetrated in shovel tests and that the project area was adequately assessed for cultural
resources.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified within the project
area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or for inclusion in the
NRHP under 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,”
and no further archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking.
However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and
Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent
discovery, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified immediately.

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by CP&Y, Inc. (CP&Y) on
behalf of the San Antonio River Authority (SARA) to conduct a cultural resources inventory survey

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located east of San Antonio in eastern Bexar County in south-central
Texas near the common junction of three significant physiographic provinces—the Edwards
Plateau, the Balcones Canyonlands, and the Gulf Coastal Plain. The Edwards Plateau and
Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a
distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains
composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the
Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this
transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation,
and animal life.
The Gulf Coastal Plain, which extends as far north as the Ouachita uplift in southern
Oklahoma and westward to the Balcones Escarpment, consists of seaward-dipping bodies of
sedimentary rock, most of which are of terrigenous clastic origin, that reflect the gradual infilling
of the basin from its margins (Abbott 2001). The fluviodeltaic sedimentary rocks are arranged in
an offlapped sequence, with interdigitated and capping eolian, littoral, and estuarine facies making
up a relatively minor component of the lithology. Major bounding disconformities between these
formations are usually interpreted to represent depositional hiatuses that occurred during periods
of low sea level. The oldest rocks in this sequence are of Late Cretaceous age.
Hydrologically, the project area is situated within the San Antonio River and Guadalupe
river basins. The project area is situated on the upland and floodplain terraces of Salitrillo Creek.
Salitrillo Creek flows generally southeastward, discharging into Martinez Creek in eastern Bexar
County. Martinez Creek, in turn, flows eastward into Cibolo Creek near the intersection of the
Bexar, Wilson, and Guadalupe county lines. Cibolo Creek meanders southeastward, flowing into
the San Antonio River north of Karnes City in Karnes County. The San Antonio River flows
generally southeastward across the Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Guadalupe
River near Tivoli along the Refugio-Calhoun county line. The Guadalupe River continues
southeastward a short distance, discharging into the Gulf of Mexico at San Antonio Bay.
Elevations within the project area slope gently down toward Salitrillo Creek, ranging from
approximately 186.5 to 178.0 meters (612.0 to 584.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl).

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

In general, the bedrock throughout central Texas is composed of Late Cretaceous
formations that dip slightly to the east and are predominantly composed of calcareous clay, shale,
limestone, and marl, with a small portion of sandstone (Barnes 1983). These geologic units are
overlain in some areas by unconsolidated Quaternary alluvial floodplain and fluviatile terrace
deposits. On the surface, these formations weather into a rounded, gently rolling topography with
a few bluff faces exposed in stream valleys where more resistant strata are present.
Specifically, the project area is situated on the Upper Cretaceous Navarro Group and
Marlbrook Marl (“Upper Taylor Marl”) formations (Kknm), which consist of marl, clay, sandstone,
and siltstone (BEG 1983). Stream valleys below the Balcones Escarpment tend to be entrenched
and lack active floodplains, and terrace structures are typically located above flood level along
entrenched streams, resulting in preservation of fluviatile morphology in point bars, oxbows, and
abandoned channel segments. The nearby Edwards Formation is composed of hard, micritic
limestone beds, some of which are chert-bearing. Other beds are extensively burrowed and
weathered into “honeycombed” porous rock. Caverns and sinkholes are known to occur
throughout central and southwestern Texas in the Edwards Formation and Austin Chalk
limestones, but they are not especially common. The nearby Edwards Limestone constitutes one
of the largest chert resources on the Great Plains (Frederick and Ringstaff 1994; Frederick et al.
1994), and expansive outcrops of Edwards Group chert are often accompanied by extensive
aboriginal lithic scatters created during raw material procurement (or “quarrying”) activities. In the
absence of aggrading depositional environments, such lithic procurement sites are typically
restricted to the deflated modern ground surface, on which the native limestone bedrock is
typically exposed over large areas.
Soils in Bexar County, Texas, formed from the underlying sedimentary formations,
including limestone, chalky limestone, chalk, shaly clay, marly clay, sandy clay, calcareous clay,
sand, and sandstone (Taylor et al. 1991). Alluvial deposits of recent or ancient age occur along
the principal rivers and streams of the county, but soil thickness in upland environments is typically
minimal, and extensive bedrock outcrops are commonly exposed on the modern ground surface.
The majority of the soils in the project area consist of Pleistocene-age clayey deposits of
the Heiden and Houston Black soils series, which formed in situ via weathering from underlying
shale and marl bedrock (Figure 4; Table 1) (NRCS 2019). A small segment of the project area
located at the point at which the proposed right-of-way turns away from the IH 10 frontage road
is characterized by Holocene-age clayey and loamy alluvium of the Tinn and Frio soil units.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 years Before Present [B.P.]) through the Late
Glacial period (14,000 to 10,000 years B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 years B.P. to
present). Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-

central Texas was considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that
the Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming
and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were
gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During
the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable
than during the Late Glacial. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and
post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period
continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration
to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 years B.P. Recent studies by Bryant
and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were
probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Bexar County is now located within the South-Central Climatic Division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar

1983:18, 50). Regional temperature ranges from 4 to 36 degrees Celsius (°C) (39 to 96 degrees
Fahrenheit (°F), with an average annual temperature of 18°C (64 F).
Average annual precipitation in the region is approximately 78.7 centimeters
(31.0 inches). Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall (Baker
1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain that fell
within an 18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9centimeter (22.0-inch) deluge that fell in less than three hours near O’Harris, Texas in May 1935
(Baker 1975). Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter,
frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing
upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of
the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer,
cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal
convective storms.

2.4

BIOTA

The project area is located in the Balconian Biotic Province on the southern fringes of the
Edwards Plateau (Blair 1950). The Edwards Plateau and associated Balcones Escarpment is
characterized by a mixture of species from the Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, and
Kansan, Balconian provinces. While three vegetation regions are recognized by Tharp (1939)
within the limits of the Balconian Province, the project area is situated in the oak-cedar region that
corresponds to the dissected southern and eastern part of the Edwards Plateau.
Fifty-seven species of mammals are known from the Balconian Province, though none of
these species are restricted to this province. Common mammalian species include white-tailed
deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit, raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed
mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite,
eastern meadowlark, mourning dove, killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted
kingfisher, and mockingbird. Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include
six-lined racerunner, rat snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard,
rough green snake, copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green tree frog, Blanchard’s
cricket frog, diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of
bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these
species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located near the southern boundary of Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central
Texas Archeological Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of central Texas practiced a
generally nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to
much of the rest of North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have
changed markedly through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8,500 YEARS B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian
bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and
settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central
Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There
is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is
divided into two periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These

H030-180237

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points
(i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which
is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and
Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8,500 TO 1,200 YEARS B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most markedly,
burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the Late
Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In addition,
the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute evidence
of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially accounts for the

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1,200 TO 350 YEARS B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 YEARS B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first Spanish incursions into the area known as present-day Bexar County began in
1691 when the expedition of the first appointed governor of the province of Texas, Domingo Terán

14

de los Ríos, was sent by the Spanish Crown to East Texas. The focus of his entrada was to
reinforce military and mission presence among the Caddo Indians as well as to investigate rumors
of French settlements near the Atakapan Indians on the southeast Texas Coast (Chipman 1992;
Wade 2003). De los Ríos crossed the Rio Grande on May 28, and, by June 13, he had advanced
to the future site of San Antonio. There, he named the fresh water river after the Portuguese
Franciscan friar Saint Anthony of Padua (Chipman 1992; Long 2010b). By June 19, the
governor’s entrada had reached the Guadalupe River, where he encountered a large party of
Jumano Indians along with an unnamed group of indigenous allies (Chipman 1992). After Terán
de los Rios made his way northeastward, he followed the same route of Alonso De Leon’s fourth
expedition during the previous year in 1690. Portions of this route were likely a network of
preexisting Indian trade paths composed of a main course out of which forked several feeder
routes (Long 2010b). This trail system was to become an avenue of Spanish colonial domination
for the transportation of goods and commerce; historically, it is known as El Camino Real, or
“King’s Road.” Later, after Spanish rule, this route was referred to as both the San AntonioNacogdoches Road and the Old San Antonio Road.
Before the first Spanish explorations of the area, several Native American cultures
occupied the Edwards Plateau and present-day Bexar County. This included the distinct
archeological manifestation known as the Toyah Phase, as well as the descendants of the
Coahuiltecan-speakers, the Payaya, Tonkawa, and Jumano (which included sub-groups Cibolo,
Hape, Mescale, Cholome, Cantona, Catqueza, and Caynaya) (Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012; Wade
2003). The Payaya were the first Native Americans affiliated with the San Antonio area and were
among the first to be baptized and converted at the Spanish Mission San Antonio de Valero
(Cambell 2010). Post European-contact tribes included the well known Lipan Apache, KiowaApache, Wichita, and Comanche (Newcomb 1961; Wade 2003). Lesser-known groups and
“micro-social coalitions” included the Ape, Arame, Bagname, Bobole, Ervipiame, Geniocane,
Gueiquesale, Jumee, Mabibit, Manos Priestas, Natage, Ocane, Pataguache, Pinanaca, Siano,
Teaname, Teroodan, Ypandi, Xaesar, and Xoman, all of which appeared in the Spanish records
after the mid-18th century (Wade 2003).
As New Spain expanded its frontier boundary north past the Rio Grande River, the viceroy
in Mexico City had sent the Aguirre expedition to pursue lands upon which to build future mission
and presidio complexes (Chipman 1992). This was part of a continuing effort to convert the Tejas
indios (Chipman 1992). On April 5, 1701, Fathers Olivares and Espinosa traveled with the Aguirre
entrada to the area of present-day San Antonio, where they were much impressed with the natural
landscape and water resources (Chipman 1992). At San Pedro Springs, they encountered a party
of 500 Native American members of the Chaularame, Siupan, and Sijame tribes (Wade 2003).
The Aguirre expedition utilized four indigenous persons as tour guides and scouts as it progressed
northeastward (Ward 2003).
In 1718, Governor Martin de Alarcon sent another expedition back to the area the Aguirre
group had explored earlier in 1701. When Franciscan Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares
arrived with a small escort at the area near the headwaters of San Pedro Springs on May 1, 1718,
he rendezvoused with Governor Alarcon’s entrada, who subsequently awarded him with the site
(Chipman 1992; Wade 2003). Thus was born the San Antonio de Valero Mission. Four days

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

after the beginning of the mission’s construction, the military garrison, San Antonio de Bexar
Presidio, was founded one mile to the north in honor of the dukes of Bexar Spanish royalty (Wade
2003). The newly founded mission was, at first, structurally composed of mud, straw, and wood.
Later, it housed the four or five missionized Native Americans that Olivares had raised since
childhood (Chipman 1992). The first civilian settlement in this area was centered around the
presidio, Villa de Bexar (Chipman 1992). Due to its location between hostile tribes on the Texas
coast—the Karankawas—and further northeast into the Edwards Plateau, the Apaches and
Comanches, the Bexar complex became the “most important town in Spanish Texas” (Chipman
1992). By 1718, several non-violent indigenous groups joined the mission: the Jamrame,
Payaya, and Pamaya groups (Long 2010b). By this time, the Spanish had built several more
missions in the region. Fray Antonio Margil de Jesus established the San José y San Miguel de
Aguayo Mission in 1720, the San Francisco Xavier de Naxara was established in 1722, and the
Aguayo Mission merged with the San Antonio de Valero mission in 1726 (Long 2010b). In addition
to these settlements, three more missions were moved to the area along the San Antonio River
in 1731 after the East Texas enterprise with the Caddo Indians had failed. These missions were
the Nuestra Senora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña, San Francisco de la Espada, and San
Juan Capistrano (Long 2010b).
In 1724, the San Antonio de Valero Presidio was moved to present-day Alamo Plaza from
its previous site near the present-day Military Plaza (Long 2010b). The new area provided not
only a vital fresh water source from San Pedro Springs, but there was also a large concentration
of naturally occurring salt approximately 15 leagues (45.0 miles) west of San Antonio (Wade
2003). The Spanish magistrates declared San Pedro Springs as public land in 1729, making it
one of the oldest municipal parks in the country (Long 2010b). The captain of the presidio, Jose
de Urrutia, constructed the first Comandancia in the 1730s as a one-room adobe brick building
(Draves 2010). Urrutia’s predecessor and son, Toribio de Urrutia, added to the construction of
the building, giving it an archetypical Spanish Colonial design. By 1804, the residence had six
rooms and housed the interim governor of Texas at the time, Juan Ignacio Perez (Draves 2010).
The fledgling community at the San Antonio mission complex had been mainly composed
of soldiers, Mexican frontiersmen, and assorted families until 56 persons from the Canary Islands
were introduced to the compound on March 9, 1731 (Long 2010b). Together, they formed the
villa of the San Antonio de Bexar, the first European civil government operating in Texas that was
recognized by the Spanish King (Jasinski 2010). As experienced agriculturalists, the Canary
Islanders helped the residents establish a comprehensive network of acequias, or gravity-drawn
irrigation canals. The oldest acequia at the site was the Concepcion, or Pajalache, which was
constructed prior to the Canarians arrival in 1729 along present-day Garden and Roosevelt
streets. This waterway was purported to be wide enough for Franciscans to employ small boats
“to transport themselves to and from the mission and to repair the canal” (Long 2010a). Soon
after, the village’s plans were officially drawn. The San Fernando de Bexar Church was begun in
1738, and it stood in the center of the village between two plazas—Plaza de las Islas (Square of
the Islands) on the east, and Plaza de la Constitucion (Constitution Square) on the west (Crook
1964). Most of the early buildings in San Antonio were one-story flat-roofed adobe constructions
built for defense, often with three-foot thick walls that could deflect bullets, and most were
constructed with grated windows (Crook 1964).

From the 1740s to 1760s, San Antonio de Bexar prospered in its infancy, especially
compared to that of other missions during this time. However, this era was rife with constant raids
and attacks from various Native American plains horse cultures. From 1733 to 1739, the complex
at San Antonio suffered small raids from the Apache, and, as a result, Captain Urrutia began a
punitive campaign (Wade 2003). As a retaliatory measure against the Spaniards for pillaging a
Native American rancheria, 350 Ypandi and Natage men, women, and children attacked de Bexar
on June 30, 1745 (Wade 2003). As a result of this conflict, four chiefs (two Natage and two
Ypandi) were arrested, only to be later released with 100 other imprisoned Natives from each
tribe, as a part of a peace initiative between the local tribes and the authorities at de Bexar (Wade
2003). On August 19, 1749, the treaty was signed and celebrated with ceremonies and a large
feast for Natives, Anglos, and Spaniards (Wade 2003). From the years 1749 to 1755, the Spanish
had few to no conflicts with the Natage, Ypandi, or Apaches (Wade 2003). However, this armistice
was short-lived, and raids continued from both the Comanches and Lipan Apaches well into the
19th century.
After issuing the decree of Royal Regulation of 1772, the Spanish government moved the
capital of the Province of Texas, Los Adaes, from East Texas to San Antonio de Bexar (McCorkle
2010). This decision was based on several factors: the new area was more suitable with friendlier
Indians and had ample sources of water and decent grazing land; it was almost 400 miles closer
to the true Spanish frontier lines; the French had sold arms to the tribes in the northeast that
already were weary of the proselytizing efforts of the Spanish friars; and the abandonment and
disenfranchisement of the East Texas mission campaign over the Caddo Indians had resulted in
failure (Chipman 1992). The population in Bexar was growing by 1777. There were now more
than 1,350 military and civilian residents made up of an ethnically diverse pallet of Europeans,
Afro-Mexicans, African-Americans, mestizos, and mulattos (Long 2010b). Additionally, there
were more than 700 mission Indians that were mostly composed of Coahuiltecan speakers
needing protection from the invasion of the Comanche and Apaches (Long 2010b).
Despite its official designation, the town of San Antonio de Bexar was said to resemble ”a
poor village rather than the capital of a province," according to Father Juan A. Morfi when he
visited in 1778 as a part of an inspection tour of the Provincias Internas (Long 2010b). The town’s
grid was composed of narrow, crooked, and irregular unpaved streets that lacked any systematic
planning (Crook 1964). The majority of the structures, called jacales, were composed of mud,
sticks, and thatched roofs, and often had dirt floors (Long 2010b). This was a period of socioeconomic stagnation for San Antonio, for no schools were built, no arts were practiced, and no
professional class had flourished. The town was drained of any resemblance to a civilized society
higher than a brackish agricultural outpost isolated on the northernmost Spanish frontier
(Fehrenbach 1974). Despite these setbacks, the population was nonetheless growing and
reached 1,878 citizens by 1790 (although the indigenous population was declining) (Long 2010b).
By the late 18th century, the Spanish Crown had grown extremely displeased with the
circumstances of the Provinces Internas in dealing with an uninterested and declining local
indigenous population. Furthermore, the Comanches were systematically marauding all their
outposts. In 1772 and 1773, the college of Zacatecas took control of the four remaining missions
in San Antonio, and, in September of 1792, the president of the Texas missions, Father Jose

H030-180237

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Francisco Lopez, recommended that the Valero and La Bahia missions be secularized (Chipman
1992). This offer was especially appealing to the Viceroy Revilla Gigedo II because, as a
consequence, the Indians at the missions transformed from financially responsible wards of the
state to tax-paying Spanish citizens (Chipman 1992). By 1794, all of the missions in San Antonio
were partially secularized. As a last-ditch effort, the Purisima Concepcion and San Jose missions
attempted to convert the remaining 43 Indians in residence (Chipman 1992; Fehrenbach 1974).
Secularization was followed with the militarization of San Antonio de Valero, later known as the
Alamo. To strengthen defenses against Indian attacks, a walled perimeter was constructed
around the Alamo and its plazas, and a lookout fort was built on the river 2.0 kilometers (1.2 miles)
away (Long 2010b). This era also saw a flourishing agricultural and cattle ranching community,
and the first organized cattle drives from South Texas were routed to both Coahuila and Louisiana
(Chipman 1992). In a Spanish government census report from 1795, professions in San Antonio
included 69 ranchers, 60 farmers, six cart drivers, four fisherman, four carpenters, two
blacksmiths, tax collectors, notaries, and priests (Chipman 1992).
By the early 19th century, the Province of Texas encompassed no more than 4,000 nonIndians, a dozen dilapidated missions, two rebuilt presidio garrisons, three settlements, and two
roads (Chipman 1992). Soon, the revolutionary developments in New Spain gave rise to a
turbulent and bloody era. In September 1810, Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a radicalized
priest later known as the “Father of Mexican Independence,” publicly denounced Spanish
hegemonic rule over New Spain in his Grito de Dolores to a crowd of Indians and mestizos
(Chipman 1992). This grito echoed across the nation and ignited a class war against the Spanish
royalist forces. On January 21, 1811, Juan Bautista de las Casas organized an armed
insurrection of the San Antonio complex and successfully seized the acting governor and his staff
(Chipman 1992). This proved to be a short-lived campaign. By March, royalist-based
counterinsurgents removed Las Casas from power, and, by the fall of 1811, the royalists had
gained complete control of Texas (Chipman 1992). After Hidalgo’s death in 1811, Jose Maria
Morelos y Pavon called a congressional session in Chilpancingo, which delegated a declaration
of independence from Spain that included a constitution outlining a reformation of new principles
of social justice like the elimination of slavery and distinctions among classes (Chipman 1992).
The Gutierrez-Magee expedition was a filibustering campaign aimed at conquering royalist
presence in Central Texas under the military command of Santisima Trinidad de Salcedo. The
Republican army led by Simon de Herrara and filibuster Samuel Kemper consisted of a mixture
of Anglos, Indians, turncoat royalists, and Spanish (Long 2010b). In the Battle of Rosillo, the
Gutierrez-Magee army defeated Salcedo and his royalists, who in turn turned the Alamo and town
over to the Republican Army of the north (Long 2010b). In an effort to smash the rebellion once
and for all, on August 18, 1813, Spanish general and former governor of Nuevo Santander,
Joaquin de Arredondo, and his royalist army of approximately 1,600 troops engaged in the
bloodiest battle ever fought in Texas. There, they defeated a republican force of 1,400 soldiers
on the Medina River near present-day Atascosa County (Chipman 1992). As a consequence,
San Antonio suffered an enforcement of draconian laws, and hundreds of rebel sympathizers
were ruthlessly executed.

Mexico gained her independence from Spain in 1821, though the Royalists had
successfully thwarted Republican invasions throughout the previous seven years. The population
at the time was a mere 2,000 citizens (Long 2010b). During the nascent Mexican period, Texas
was merged with Coahuila to form one state, and San Antonio lost its government seat to Saltillo
some 547.2 kilometers (340.0 miles) to the southwest. When the three departments of Texas,
Coahuila, and Brazos were formed in the 1830s, San Antonio regained its political prominence,
and it once again became the seat of the Department of Texas (Jasinski 2010). Several citizens
from San Antonio helped draft the Mexican federal Constitution of 1824, which was loosely based
on the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and the Constitution of Coahuila and Texas of 1827 (McKay
2010a, 2010b). In 1825, the US government offered to purchase to Texas, an offer the Mexican
government refused.
By the early 1830s, English-speaking Anglo-American colonists
outnumbered Spanish-speaking Hispanics in Texas by an overwhelming ten to one (Fehrenbach
1974).
During the siege of Bexar from October to December 1835, San Antonio sat in the
epicenter of the Texas Revolution when Texas volunteers under the leadership of General
Edward Burleson, Stephen F. Austin, and Thomas J. Rusk seized the Alamo and town from the
grip of Mexican General Martin Perfecto de Cos (Barr 2010). San Antonio was held by the
Federalist Army of Texas until General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with his army of nearly
2,000 soldiers stormed the bastions on the fateful day of March 6, 1836. Collectively known as
the Battle of the Alamo, this conflict resulted in a Texian defeat and a Mexican regain of their
former Central Texas territories. This was overturned by the subsequent Texian victory over
Santa Anna’s army at the Battle of San Jacinto, which culminated in the complete evacuation of
the Mexican government and armed military from Texas, at least temporarily. In January 1837,
the neophyte Congress of the Republic of Texas named San Antonio the seat of the newly
organized Bexar County, which was carved from the original Spanish Department of Texas. The
Mexican and Texas revolutions left the area in a population decline; on the 1840 Census, only
339 Anglo individuals and 30 African-American slaves were listed (Jasinski 2010). In 1840, a
violent massacre of 30 Comanche chiefs that were seeking peaceful negotiations occurred on the
streets of San Antonio at the hands of Texas authorities who failed to understand the “diffuse
nature of Comanche political authority” (Schilz and Dickson 2010). During the Mexican Invasions
of 1842, San Antonio was taken twice, once in March by General Rafael Vasquez and again in
September by General Adrian Woll. The latter resulted in the Battle of Salado Creek and the
Dawson Massacre (Haynes 2010). In a census conducted in 1844, 1,000 citizens were listed,
90% of whom were Hispanic, likely of Mexican descent (Long 2010b). During this time, the culture
of the town was rooted in Hispania, where siestas, cockfights, bullfights, and nightly fandangos
were daily occurrences (Crook 1964).
Texas was officially annexed into the US in December 1845, making it the 28th state to
join the Union. This was followed by a period of socioeconomic growth, and San Antonio played
a key role as a service and distribution center for the US’s westward expansion into the New
Mexican, Arizona, and California territories. An influx of German immigrants boosted the
population of Bexar County to 5,633 in 1850, of whom 60% lived within the city limits of San
Antonio (Long 2010b). During this period, the local economy was sustained mainly through
ranching and agriculture, although the former comprised the majority of income. Beef cattle, oxen,

H030-180237

19

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

dairy cows, swine, and sheep made up the livestock focus, and corn, oats, and beans were the
main crops grown (Long 2010b). By 1857, San Antonio served as a hub to the surrounding
frontier satellites in the southwest, such as El Paso and much of Chihuahua (Crook 1964).
Due to its isolated position on the frontier of Comanche- and Lipan Apache-controlled
territories to the north and west, San Antonio gained prominence as a strategic military outpost
and troop concentration point. In 1845, before Texas was annexed, Colonel William Shelby
Harney positioned three companies of his Second US Dragoons at the Alamo, then called Camp
Almus (Crook 1964). On the eve of the Mexican War of 1846, Brigadier Colonel John Ellis Wool
founded Camp Crockett in San Antonio, which had the capacity to hold more than 2,500 troops
(Crook 1964; Hinton 2010). In 1848, the Eighth Military Department’s headquarters were moved
to San Antonio (Long 2010b). In order to supply arms and munitions to the west Texas fort system
(including more than 21 forts), the San Antonio Arsenal was constructed by the US Army in 1859
on an 8.5-hectare (21.0-acre) reservation just south of town (Long 2010b). By 1860, the
population had grown to 8,235, including 1,395 African-American slaves (Crook 1964; Long
2010b).
In February 1861, Bexar County narrowly voted 827 to 709 in favor of secession from the
Union (Timmons 1973). The county was torn on the issue of slavery due to the large percentage
of residents of German, Mexican, and African ancestry, who held vehement anti-slavery
sentiments. By 1877, the German tongue was spoken more than Spanish or English (Long
2010b). Before the state seceded from the Union on March 2, a local militia overthrew the arsenal
and placed it in Confederate hands, where it remained throughout the Civil War (Long 2010c).
Although the front lines were far from the county lines, the war nevertheless impacted San
Antonio, creating unpredictable fluctuations of Confederate currency and upsurges in cattle
rustling (Long 2010b).
Like most cities in the deep South during post-war Antebellum period, San Antonio was
not spared from economic decline. Land prices dwindled, improved farmland declined, and local
businesses failed. To make matters worse, the city suffered an outbreak of cholera in 1866 (Long
2010b). However, the cattle industry saved the economy by the late 1860s and early 1870s.
Positioned at the apogee of the “original Texas cattle kingdom,” San Antonio became an important
center for cattle drives, serving as a supply center for the trails as well as for the merino sheep
wool market (Long 2010b). The population by 1870 had grown to 12,256 residents in the city,
and the head of cattle had grown to 55,325 (Long 2010b).
The Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway was the first railroad to reach San
Antonio in February of 1877. Subsequently, Bexar County experienced economic growth and an
influx of immigrants that bolstered the community’s prosperity. Five additional railroads were
completed by 1900, including the International-Great Northern (Long 2010b). By 1880, the
population of San Antonio had grown to 20,550. The majority of the immigrants during the
Reconstruction period were Anglo-Americans from the southern states who were seeking new
socioeconomic opportunities. In a census from 1887 entitled The First Annual Report of the
Agricultural Bureau of the Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History, the ethnic
breakdown of the city of San Antonio was recorded in the following figures: “Americans 26,061;
colored [African-Americans] 3,395; English 606; Germans 6,146; French 564; Danes 26;

Hebrews 90; Irish 1,022; Italians 171; Mexicans 7,688; Spanish 101; Swedes 30; Norwegians 12;
Poles 447; Russians 64; Chinese 19; of all other nations 745” (Long 2010b). To accommodate
the needs of a growing populace, the town had 10 schools and more than 60 teachers by 1890
(Long 2010b).
As a result of the booming cattle industry and military presence, San Antonio hit its
economic stride in the 1880s as evinced by an episode of modernization in its gilded-age
infrastructure. Streets were paved, telephone systems and a city water supply were established,
hospitals and a power plant were planned, and civic government and utilities were put into place.
The longest continuously published news outlet in the county, the San Antonio Express-News,
was first published in 1865 and went from a circulation of 300 daily and 800 weekly subscribers
in the mid-1880s to 13,100 daily and 18,800 subscribers by 1906 (Donecker 2010). The railroads
also contributed to the growth of the towns of Macdona, Von Ormy, Cassin, Atascosa, Thelma,
Beckman, Luxello, Converse, and Kirby (Long 2010b). By the late 1880s, the Industrial
Revolution reached San Antonio, which had four breweries, four ice factories, three book
binderies, three tanneries, and an iron foundry (Long 2010b). Notable businesses included Lone
Star Brewery, Alamo Cement Company, and Pioneer Flour Mills, and Bexar County had 328
factories in operation by 1920 (Long 2010b).
Between the years of 1885 and 1891, more than 54.6 hectares (135.0 acres) were offered
to the US War Department for a permanent army post to be constructed. This post included a
military headquarters, hospital, artillery, and infantry quarters and would be later named Fort Sam
Houston in honor of General Sam Houston. At the onset of the Spanish-American War, Theodore
Roosevelt’s famous “Rough Riders,” otherwise known as the First US Volunteer Cavalry, was
formed and trained at Fort Sam Houston (Cutrer 2010). The turn of the century saw exponential
population growth in San Antonio from 53,321 in 1900 to 96,614 by 1910, making it the largest
populated city in Texas. With the chaos brought on by the Mexican Revolution during the early
1910s came an increase of Mexican immigrants pursuing better opportunities in Texas. To
accommodate the needs of a large Hispanic population, several Spanish-language newspapers
were set in print, such as La Prensa in 1913 (Long 2010b). These publishers provided the
backbone of Hispanic culture by covering local and Mexican politics and printed news of local
Mexican-American organizations like La Gran Liga Mexicanista, Liga Femenil Mexicanista, La
Agrupación Protectiva Mexicana, La Liga Protectora Mexicana, and Orden Hijos de America
(Pycior 2010).
Mark Twain once identified San Antonio as one of the “four unique cities” in the US along
with San Francisco, Boston, and New Orleans. Undoubtedly, this was due to the ethnic diversity
of German, Hispanic, African-American, and Anglo-American cultures and their influences on
politics, customs, Victorian architecture, cuisine, and languages within the town. Germans
constituted the largest ethnic group to immigrate from Europe. Most of the German settlers were
experienced farmers, educated professionals, skilled tradesmen, and of the middle class (Jordan
2010). Most settled in a fragmented belt across Texas, and a large percentage ended up forming
a nucleus in Bexar County as a result of chain migration. The popularity of immigrant guide books
written by charismatic pioneers like Johann Friedrich Ernst, the “father of immigrants,” wooed
potential immigrant families (Jordan 2010). These families brought a religious pallet of

H030-180237

21

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

denominations composed of Catholics, Methodists, Lutherans, Jews, and atheists. German
musical influences were absorbed into the San Antonio cultural fabric as early as the 1840s. The
Beethoven Männerchor, a German men’s choir, was founded at this time. In 1874, a number of
German musicians formed the first orchestra in the region and played the first state Saengerfest
in San Antonio, which predates the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra by almost 60 years (Jordan
2010; Long 2010b). German architecture abounded in the city, the most prominent area being a
22-block Victorian neighborhood now known as the King William Historic District. Named after
Prussian King Wilhelm I, this district is known for its unique 19th-century architecture and German
heritage (Long 2010b). In the 1990 census, Germans were the third largest origin group in the
state with over 2,951,726 people claiming German ancestry (Jordan 2010).
By the early 20th century, San Antonio had grown from a crumbling Spanish frontier post
to a well populated industrial and military city. The agricultural and ranching economies in Bexar
County were booming as well, adding to the prosperity. The number of farms almost tripled from
1880 to 1910, when a census recorded 3,205 tenable farms with more than 800,000 improved,
farmable acres (Long 2010b). Crops included corn, milo, hergari, cane, citrus fruits, and oats,
and ranching focused on beef, dairy cattle, and poultry. Cotton has been a staple crop in the
county since the 1880s; however, the cotton industry peaked in 1926, when 27,505 bales were
produced (Long 2010b). Several factors were to blame for the crash of the cotton industry in the
1930s, such as poor farming techniques, the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, and the
introduction of the boll weevil beetle. However, a new product, mohair (a fabric made of the silky
hair of the angora goat that is typically mixed with sheep wool), became an agricultural staple in
the county and was shipped out to markets all over the United Kingdom and the American Midwest
(Long 2010b). After oil was discovered in 1889, more than 13,000 wells were drilled in Bexar
County; in 1991 alone, more than a century later, 32,548,292 barrels were produced (Long
2010b).
Although the years between 1920 and World War II were economically devastating,
technological advancements in agricultural mechanization had increased significantly. The
advent of farm machinery such as the tractor, combine, and harvester revolutionized the efficiency
of the planting cycles, and many tasks that were once based upon difficult manual labor were now
alleviated with such machines. Around the beginning of World War II, Bexar County led the state
in mechanized farming. Tenant farming also increased during this period. In the late 19th century,
only 10% of farmers were tenants; this figure increased to 50% by 1930 (Long 2010b). The
farming labor force was dominated by persons of Mexican descent, while the majority of farm
owners and leaseholders were of Anglo descent. As the mechanization of farms progressed,
many laborers were released into the industrial sectors.
The stock market crash of 1929 had a substantial impact on the local economy in Bexar
County. Unemployment and hardship were commonplace and relief efforts were initiated by the
federal and state governments, including the Federal Emergency Relief Act and the Texas
Rehabilitation and Relief Commission, both of which were passed in 1933. Direct work relief was
doled out to the unemployed through President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal programs such
as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), Works Progress Administration (WPA), National Youth
Administration (NYA), and Public Works Administration (PWA). The CCC employed more than

50,000 Texans and emphasized natural resources, archeology, forest and soil conservation, and
the construction of recreational parks. This included 31 state parks in Texas alone (Procter 2010).
As a result of these programs, many streets and sewers were paved, and parks and bridges were
built. La Villita, once a Coahuiltecan village, sat at the center of early Spanish life in the city and
was renovated with WPA funds in the 1930s; similarly, all the missions, including the Alamo,
received comparable treatment (Long 2010b). By 1941, the WPA had also funded 5,181.6 meters
(17,000.0 feet) of concrete improvements (including six bridges) downtown along the San Antonio
River, known as “Paseo del Rio,” or the San Antonio Riverwalk. Despite the economic tribulations
caused by the Great Depression, the population of Bexar County rose to 500,460 citizens by
1950.
From the onset of World War II through the Korean War, Bexar County became known as
an important military center by serving both the US Army and US Air Force. The San Antonio
Aviation Cadet Center and Fort Sam Houston-Joint Base San Antonio serve as headquarters of
the US Army. Other military buildings include the San Antonio Naval Recruiting District, the US
Army Medical Command, the Medical Education and Training Campus, the Brooke Army Medical
Center, and the Institute for Surgical Research: The Burn Center (Manguso 2010). More than
21,000 civilians were employed at Kelly Field during the height of World War II, and 6,800 men
graduated from Kelly’s Advanced Flying School from 1939 to 1943 (Long 2010b). The Brooke
Army Medical Center is one of the premiere institutions of medicine in the country and serves a
large retired military community based in San Antonio. The availability of health care providers
and hospitals and dozens of institutions of higher education have made Bexar County an
appealing place for veterans to live since the mid-20th century.
Today, Bexar County is known for its numerous centers of higher education. During San
Antonio’s tenure as the provincial capital, the Spanish-speaking settlers established several
private and free schools. In 1789, Jose Francisco de la Mata was “led by pity for the ignorance
of the youth in the villa,” and petitioned the cabildo, or town council, to defray funds for a private
school (Wright 1916). In the early 19th century, many Anglo-American settlers immigrated into
Bexar County under Stephan F. Austin’s empresario land grant, and, by 1828, the McClure’s
School was founded to serve the growing Anglo community (Long 2010b). These schools were
mostly short-lived, and McClure’s and several other schools closed during both the tumultuous
revolutionary periods.
Many of the first schools were often operated and funded by various religious groups, such
as the Marianists. In 1852, the first Catholic bishop in Galveston ordered the Marianists to open
a private charter school in San Antonio, and, in 1855, they bought the 36.4 hectares (90.0 acres)
surrounding the dilapidated Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña Mission (Wood
2010). By 1861, the mission had been completely refurbished into a school that operated under
their influence until 1911. In 1888, they opened the San Fernando Cathedral (Wood 2010). To
accommodate the needs of the German immigrants, the German-English School opened in 1858,
and the Freedmen's Bureau School opened its doors to newly liberated slaves during the
Reconstruction period (Wood 2010). In 1879, the Episcopalian Diocese of Texas opened St.
Mary’s Hall, the first public girl’s school in the area. Several larger institutions of higher education
opened after Word College was chartered in 1881. Since then, Our Lady of the Lake University

H030-180237

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

was opened in 1912, St. Mary’s University in 1924, Trinity University in 1952, and the University
of Texas San Antonio in 1969. Two community colleges, the San Antonio College and St. Philip’s
College, opened their doors in 1925 and 1927, respectively. In 2018 to 2019, there were
489 public schools operating in Bexar County serving more 348,356 students, 85% of whom were
Hispanic. In 2019, the county’s public schools had a diversity score of 0.32, slightly below the
state average of 0.41. Based on a census taken from 2013 to 2017, approximately 82% of the
population over 25 years of age had a high school education, yet only 26% had a Bachelor’s
degree or higher.
From the 1850s to the 1950s, the citizens of Bexar County generally voted for Democratic
leaders in both local and national elections. This trend reversed when Republican Dwight D.
Eisenhower defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 election. Voters went Democratic
in the 1960, 1964, and 1968 elections in favor of John F. Kennedy and local Texan Lyndon B.
Johnson. Republicans won the elections of 1972, 1980, 1984, and 1988, only to lose in 1992 and
1996 to Democrat Bill Clinton. George W. Bush took the 2000 and 2004 elections, while Barack
Obama took back the county with Democratic votes in 2008 and 2012, and the trend continued
in the 2016 election when Hilary Clinton won the county’s vote. Today, there are over
1,073,320 registered voters in Bexar County, albeit only 51% of them voted in the 2016 election.
There were 117,546 firms listed in the business census of 2012, and 71,287 of them were
owned by minorities. In 2017, the poverty rate was 18% (39.7 million people), slightly above the
national annual 12%. Today, the largest industries are all technology-based, including advanced
manufacturing, aerospace, bioscience, information technology, new energy economy, financial
services, and military and defense. There are currently four military bases in Bexar County:
Brooks, Lackland, and Randolph Air Force bases and Fort Sam Houston. Aside from the military
and technology, San Antonio is well known for being a commercial center and an agricultural hub
that serves more than 47 surrounding counties. In a census from 2012, 2,457 tenable farms were
listed in Bexar County covering more than 138,759.4 hectares (342,882.0 acres) of improved
farmland. Principle livestock includes beef cattle, goats, poultry, horses, and sheep. The most
profitable crops include grains, oilseeds, dry beans, peas, coastal hay, wheat, corn, and sorghum
for grain. In 2012, the nursery and greenhouse commodity values towered over the value of sales
from all other agricultural products, indicating a shift from farming to a more urbanized and
industry-based labor force. The largest employers in San Antonio are mostly commercial
businesses and include the H-E-B supermarket company. Food groups and the United Service
Automobile Association collectively employ more than 20,000 people.
Since the 1980s, tourism has been a major contributor to the San Antonio economy and
has provided tens of thousands of jobs. Notable theme parks like Fiesta Texas and SeaWorld
attract people from across the nation, and protected parks like the Alamo, the San Antonio
missions, and the National Historical Park also serve as international tourist stops. Festivals
occur throughout the year that embrace the area’s Spanish roots, such as the Day of the Dead,
Fiesta San Antonio, and the Texas Folklife Festival. The Riverwalk district attracts more than
11.4 million people annually, 80% of whom are from outside of Bexar County. In 2009, the
healthcare industry in Bexar County was the third largest in the state, employing more than

24

24-Inch Sanitary Sewer Line Project, San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas

5,000 workers. Medical institutions include the Santa Rosa Hospital, Brooke Army Medical
Center, and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.
As of 2019, Bexar County was home to 1,958,841 residents, making it the 10th largest
city in America. However, the population growth rate has slowed over recent years and has not
gone over 3.0% since 2010. Hispanics dominate the ethnic makeup of Bexar County at 59%,
Anglo-Americans at 30%, African-Americans at 8%, and Asians at 3%. The poverty rate is
currently 16%, slightly above the national average. Because of its large Hispanic population, San
Antonio has been at the forefront of the civil rights movement. By the 1940s, the military
integrated its troops and the “cities accommodations” were available to Mexican-Americans
(Jasinski 2010). In 1953, San Antonio elected its first Mexican-American city council member
Henry B. Gonzalez, who outspokenly campaigned for civil rights and to end segregation. Later,
Gonzalez was the first elected Tejano to the US House of Representatives. Desegregation came
late to African-Americans in San Antonio; however, on March 16, 1960, it became the first city in
the South to integrate its lunch counters by serving four African-American men. Shortly after, the
San Antonio Interracial Committee was organized to implement and litigate a series of involuntary
desegregations from public establishments. Overall, desegregation was a gradual and arduous
process full of beatings, sit-ins, and arrests, but institutions like the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) paved the way by helping to integrate city parks, golf
courses, public swimming pools, and municipal bus and train stations.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon performed background archival research on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) for information on previously recorded cultural
resources sites and historic properties in and near the project area as well as previous cultural
resources investigations conducted in the vicinity of the project area. Based on this archival
research, 12 known archeological sites are present within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the
project area (Figure 5; Table 2) (THC 2019). All of these known cultural resources are located
well beyond the boundaries of the project area and would not be disturbed as a result of the
proposed undertaking. No cemeteries or historic properties listed on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or designated as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) are located within or
adjacent to the project area. (Thompson et al. 2008)
Nearly the entire project has been previously surveyed for cultural resources. Based on
the THC’s TASA, three prior cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the project
area. The first survey conducted was conducted in 1999 by Paul Price Associates, Inc. (Kotter
and Jones 1999) followed by a survey conducted in support of SARA’s proposed Graytown Road
Wastewater Treatment Plant (Schroeder 2007). These surveys roughly followed Salitrillo Creek
at the eastern end of the project area. A year later, the Center for Archaeological Research of
The University of Texas at San Antonio surveyed the IH 10 corridor (Thompson et al. 2008), which
parallels a majority of the project area.
Examination of historical aerial photographs dating from 1955 to the present and US
Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps dating from 1959 to the present indicates that the
project area was utilized for agricultural purposes prior to construction of the existing Salitrillo
wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) on the site between 1973 and 1986 (NETR 2019). No
standing structures of potentially historic age are present within the project area or visible on
historical imagery.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

On July 31, 2019, Horizon archeologists Jesse O. Dalton and Mckinzie Froese conducted
an intensive cultural resources survey of the project area. The survey was conducted under the
overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator. The purpose of the survey was to
locate any significant cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed
undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the project area and thoroughly inspected the
modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The project area is
situated on the terraces and uplands adjacent to Salitrillo Creek. The existing WWTP facility
adjacent to the project area has been extensively disturbed via the construction, use, and ongoing
maintenance of the existing industrial facilities, including sewage treatment ponds, process
equipment, administrative buildings, parking lots, and driveways. The project area itself has
historically been used for agricultural purposes and likely experienced some disturbances from
season plowing and harvesting activities, construction of the nearby wastewater treatment plant,
and nearby construction and maintenance of IH 10. The project area is situated on the upland
and floodplain terraces of Salitrillo Creek, which skirts the northeastern corner of the project area.
The project area crosses tracts of primarily undeveloped land consisting of short to tall grasses,
which typically afforded poor visibility of the modern ground surface (<20%). Two driveways exit
off the southeastern side of the IH 10 frontage road, crossing the project area and providing
access to existing commercial and industrial facilities to the south (Figures 6 to 9).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1.0 mile) per 30.5meter (100.0-foot) width of linear right-of-way (ROW), or fraction thereof. In addition, for blockarea projects, the TSMASS call for excavation of three shovel tests per acre for project areas
measuring 0.8 hectare (2.0. acres) or less in size. As such, a minimum of 16 shovel tests would
be required within the proposed 1.6-kilometer- (1.0-mile-) long linear sewer line ROW. Horizon
excavated a total of 16 shovel tests during the survey, thereby meeting the TSMASS
requirements for a project area of this size (Figure 10). Shovel testing typically revealed dense,
blocky black clay on the modern ground surface and extending to the maximum depths of shovel
tests at depths ranging from 30.0 to 45.0 centimeters (11.8 to 17.7 inches) below surface. It is
Horizon’s opinion that sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits
were fully penetrated in shovel tests and that the project area was adequately assessed for
cultural resources.

Shovel tests generally measured 30.0 centimeters (11.8 inches) in diameter and were
excavated to a target depth of 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface, to the top of pre-Holocene
deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable. In practice, shovel tests were terminated at depths
ranging from 30.0 to 40.0 centimeters (11.8 to 15.7 inches) below surface due to the presence of
dense, pre-Holocene sandy clay sediments. All sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter
(mm) (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. Standard shovel test logs were completed for each shovel test
describing the location, strata, soil texture and color, archeological materials (if present), and any
unusual characteristics of the surrounding landscape. All sediments excavated from shovel tests
were replaced in the shovel test hole upon completion of recording. The Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) coordinates of each shovel test were determined using hand-held Garmin
Foretrex or eTrex Global Positioning System (GPS) devices using the North American Datum of
1983 (NAD 83). Specific shovel test data are summarized in Appendix A.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel testing and backhoe trenching results. Digital photographs were
taken, and a photographic log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for
cultural resources. Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with
maker’s marks) and non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and
metal scrap) were to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced
in the same location in which they were found. As no cultural materials were observed during the
survey, the collection policy was not brought into play.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 CFR
800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

On July 31, 2019, Horizon archeologists Jesse O. Dalton and Mckinzie Froese conducted
an intensive cultural resources survey of the project area. The survey was conducted under the
overall direction of Jahleen E. Sefton, Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 8914. The purpose of the survey was to locate any significant cultural resources that
potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the project area and to make preliminary determinations of whether or
not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important
historic events and/or personages. Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources
are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological
resources for designation as SALs.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

On July 31, 2019, Horizon archeologists Jesse O. Dalton and Mckinzie Froese conducted
an intensive cultural resources survey of the project area. The survey was conducted under the
overall direction of Jahleen E. Sefton, Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 8914. The purpose of the survey was to locate any significant cultural resources that
potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the
project area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age
cultural resources. The project area is situated on the upland and floodplain terraces of Saltillo
Creek, which skirts the northeastern corner of the project area. The project area crosses tracts
of primarily undeveloped land consisting of short to tall grasses, which typically afforded poor
visibility of the modern ground surface (<20%). Two driveways exit off the southeastern side of
the IH 10 frontage road, crossing the project area and providing access to existing commercial
and industrial facilities to the south.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
1.6 kilometers (1.0 mile) per 30.5-meter (100.0-foot) width of linear right-of-way (ROW), or fraction
thereof. In addition, for block-area projects, the TSMASS call for excavation of three shovel tests
per acre for project areas measuring 0.8 hectare (2.0. acres) or less in size. As such, a minimum
of 16 shovel tests would be required within the proposed 1.6-kilometer- (1.0-mile-) long linear
sewer line ROW. Horizon excavated a total of 16 shovel tests during the survey, thereby meeting
the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this size. It is Horizon’s opinion that sediments
with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits were fully penetrated in shovel
tests and that the project area was adequately assessed for cultural resources.
No cultural resources of historic or prehistoric age were observed on the modern ground
surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated within the project area during the survey.

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

7.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified within the project
area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or for inclusion in the
NRHP under 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,”
and no further archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking.
However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and
Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent
discovery, and the THC should be notified immediately.
