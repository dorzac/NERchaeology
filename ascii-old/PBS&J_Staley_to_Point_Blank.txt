Abstract
PBS&J conducted a cultural resources survey for the Sam Houston Electric Cooperative Staley to Point
Blank 138-kV Transmission Line Project in San Jacinto County, Texas. The total survey area is
approximately 7.3 miles (11.8 kilometers) in length and 100 feet (30 meters) in width for a total area of
approximately 88.5 acres (35.8 hectares). An intensive pedestrian survey augmented with shovel testing
was performed within the 100-foot (30-meter)-wide corridor. Two prehistoric archeological sites
(41SJ220 and 41SJ222) were recorded within the project area during the course of fieldwork, along with
one modern cemetery (41SJ221). No further work within the right of way is recommended for the two
prehistoric sites located during the cultural resources survey. Monitoring may be necessary for work done
around the modern cemetery. Artifacts were not collected. Site-specific documents and photographs will
be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin.

I. INTRODUCTION
In November 2009, PBS&J conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for the proposed Sam
Houston Electric Cooperative, Inc. (SHECO) Staley to Point Blank 138-kV Transmission Line Project.
The entirety of the proposed project will consist of approximately 7.3 miles (11.8 kilometers [km]) of new
138-kilovolt (kV) transmission line in northern San Jacinto County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed
transmission line will connect SHECO’s proposed Point Blank Substation to an existing Entergy 138-kV
transmission line to the north. The existing Staley Substation is located within the existing Entergy
transmission line right of way (ROW), on the west side of Farm to Market Road (FM) 980 approximately
2 miles (3.2 km) east-northeast of the Staley community and 20 miles (32 km) east of Livingston.
The transmission line route terminates at the proposed Point Blank Substation located on Counts Road in
the northwestern portion of the City of Point Blank. PBS&J conducted the cultural resources survey
within a corridor that measured approximately 100 feet (ft) (30 meters [m]) in width centered along the
proposed transmission line centerline. A total of approximately 7.3 miles (11.8 km) encompassing
88.5 acres (35.8 hectares) was surveyed.
Intensive pedestrian survey augmented with shovel testing was conducted within areas likely to contain
intact cultural resource materials. A total of 76 shovel tests were excavated during the survey. Of this
total, 3 were positive for cultural resources.
The investigation was performed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(Public Law [PL] 89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL 91-190. 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4321, 1970); the Procedures of the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (36 CFR 800) and other appropriate cultural resources legislation and guidelines, as
well as the guidelines set forth by the Register of Professional Archaeologists and the Council of Texas
Archeologists. The objectives of the survey were to (1) locate cultural resource sites within the project
area; (2) delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of any located sites; (3) assess the integrity of each
site; and (4) provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for eligibility for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Two prehistoric archeological sites and one modern cemetery were recorded within the project area
during the course of fieldwork. Project documents associated with recorded archeological sites will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin.

II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
PHYSIOGRAPHY
San Jacinto County is located on the border between the Interior Coastal Plains and Gulf Coastal Prairies,
which are part of the subprovince Gulf Coastal Plains within the Austroriparian Physiographic Province
of Texas (Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG] 1992; Blair 1950). The study area itself, however, is
located in northern San Jacinto County entirely within the Interior Coastal Plains. The Gulf Coastal Plain
subprovince is the southern element of an elevated former sea bottom that is characterized by low
topographic relief, extensive marshy tracts, elevations below 500 ft mean sea level (msl), and sedimentary
geologic formations. The Gulf Coastal Plain was formed during the Cenozoic era when cycles of
transgression and regression of the ancestral Gulf of Mexico deposited sands, shales, clays, and marls
(Atwood 1940; Sellards et al. 1932).

CLIMATE
The Soil Survey of Polk and San Jacinto Counties, Texas (McEwen et al. 1988) describes the climate as
having long, hot summers due to the moist tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico that persistently covers
the area. Winters are fairly short with rare cold waves that only last a few days. Precipitation is evenly
distributed throughout the year, and droughts are uncommon. The average temperature in the winter is 51
degrees Fahrenheit (°F) with an average daily minimum temperature of 39 °F. Average summer
temperature is 81 °F with a daily average maximum of 93 °F. The average annual precipitation is 48.5
inches. Thunderstorms are fairly common and occur mostly in the summer. Snowfall is rare, and severe
storms and tornadoes occur only occasionally.

GEOLOGY
The Interior Coastal Plains are characterized by numerous alternating bands that consist of resistant
uncemented sands among weaker shales that erode into long, sandy ridges. At least two major fault
systems, which dip downward toward the coast, trend nearly parallel to the coastline. Clusters of faults
also concentrate over salt domes in East Texas. Numerous permanent streams dissect the general area
(BEG 1992).
The Fleming Formation is the primary geologic formation in the study area. It represents tremendous
sedimentary deposition during the Tertiary and Quaternary periods of the Cenozoic era. The Fleming
Formation consists of calcareous yellow-green to light brown clays, gray sandy clays, and in the basal
layer, dark greenish sandy clays. Near the end of the Tertiary period, large river systems deposited
calcareous muds from Cretaceous marls and limestones over a broad area of the low coastal plain. The
weathering of these marls produces a thick black soil that, when wet, forms a thick sticky mud. Within the
project area, the Fleming Formation is generally characterized by rolling Blackland Prairie interspersed
with low-forested sand and gravel ridges. This formation represents the boundary with the overlying,

II. Environmental Setting

Pleistocene-deposited, fluviatile floodplain deposits and delta sands, silts, and muds of the Willis
Formation (BEG 1992; McEwen et al. 1988; Sellards et al. 1932).
The Fleming Formation overlays the Catahoula Formation within most of the project area (McEwen et al.
1988). In some sections though, the Catahoula Formation is exposed. This formation is dated to the late
Oligocene to early Miocene. The formation consists of volcanic ash blown in from northwestern Mexico,
New Mexico, and the Trans-Pecos area of Texas starting in the Eocene. Lacustrine deposits often contain
siliceous pebbles that appear unrelated to parent materials in the upper parts of the soils, weathered
bentonitic clays, and unreworked volcanic ash.
The Willis Formation, which outcrops in the extreme southwestern portion of the study area, consists of
reddish orange sand and yellow-gray clay and silt with the clays predominating in the upper part. The
Willis Formation’s basal layer consists of gravel sheets and coarse sand with numerous ferruginous and
siliceous pebbles and great quantities of silicified wood. There is a gradual decrease in grain size as the
formation grades into the overlying sediments (Fisher 1965; Sellards et al. 1932).
Within the study area, recent alluvial terrace deposits composed of unsorted coarse sand and gravels of
dolomites, chert, quartz, and limestone are found along tributaries of the Trinity River, including Pools
Creek and Palmetto Creek. These terrace deposits have two or more levels that correspond to coastal
Pleistocene units (BEG 1992; Sellards et al. 1932).

SOILS
The Soil Conservation Service (SCS, now the Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS])
published soil surveys for Polk and San Jacinto counties in 1988 (McEwen et al. 1988). This soil survey
was utilized to describe the soil associations located within the project area. Only two major associations
were found within the project area: Woodville-Pinetucky and Laska-Colita-Oakhurst.
Woodville-Pinetucky Association: Gently sloping to strongly sloping, somewhat poorly drained and
moderately well-drained, very slowly permeable and moderately slowly permeable, loamy soils. This
association makes up approximately 18 percent of the San Jacinto/Polk County survey area, consisting of
approximately 62 percent Woodville soils, 17 percent Pinetucky soils, and 21 percent other soils of minor
extent. This association is located south of Palmetto Creek.
Laska-Colita-Oakhurst Association: Nearly level to strongly sloping, moderately well-drained and
somewhat poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable, moderately permeable, and very slowly
permeable, loamy soils. This association comprises approximately 12 percent of the survey area
(McEwen et al. 1988). Approximately 21 percent Laska soils, 19 percent Colita soils, and 16 percent
other soils of minor extent compose the association. This soil association is located north of Palmetto
Creek.

II. Environmental Setting

FLORA
The project lies within the Pineywoods vegetation area as delineated by Hatch et al. (1990). The
Pineywoods ecological region of Texas comprises approximately 15,000,000 acres of gently rolling to
hilly, forested land averaging 200 to 500 ft in elevation. Numerous perennial streams and several large
rivers dissect this area. The area has a high incidence of rainfall (35 to more than 50 inches per year),
which is fairly uniformly distributed throughout the year (Schuster and Hatch 1990). Extensive pine and
mixed pine/hardwood forests, scattered swamps, and increasing amounts of cultivated land and
pastureland characterize the vegetation communities in the area. Timber production is a primary industry
in the region and is responsible for the establishment of various age classes of regrowth hardwood and
pine forests.
The ROW is within an area that was once a vast region known as the Big Thicket, which encompassed
roughly 15 counties and over 3,000,000 acres of diverse woodlands (Ajilvsgi 1979). This region has been
significantly fragmented by farming, lumbering, oil production, and other land uses. Remnants of virgin
forests that remain are mostly restricted to remote, nearly inaccessible swamps. Several national forests
are located within the Pineywoods ecological region including the Sam Houston National Forest, Davy
Crockett National Forest, Angelina National Forest, and Sabine National Forest.
Common flora of the area include loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), and red oak,
post oak, and blackjack oak (Quercus spp.) (Blair 1950). Also common within the area are Spanish moss
(Tillandsia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

FAUNA
San Jacinto County lies within the Austroriparian Biotic Province (Blair 1950) and falls primarily in the
Pineywoods vegetational area (Hatch et al. 1990; McMahan et al. 1984). Wildlife habitats in the area
correspond to vegetation types representative of the region. These habitat types include upland hardwood
forest, pine and mixed pine-hardwood forest, bottomland/riparian forest, grassland, forest regeneration
areas, and hydric and aquatic habitats. This biotic province would have provided a broad range of animal
species suitable for exploitation by historic and prehistoric populations.
The Austroriparian Biotic Province supports numerous urodele species (salamanders and newts), and
anuran species (frogs and toads) (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999; Blair 1959; Dixon 2000). Turtles that may
occur in this region include three three-toed box turtle, pallid spiny softshell turtle, and the western
chicken turtle. Lizards that may occur include the green anole, six-lined race runner, five-lined skink,
broadhead skink, ground skink, and the northern fence lizard (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999; Dixon 2000).
Snakes that may occur include the buttermilk, Texas rat snake, western mud snake, eastern hognose
snake, prairie kingsnake, eastern coachwhip, blotched water snake, and several venomous species such as
the southern copperhead, western cottonmouth, Texas coral snake, and western pygmy rattlesnake (Dixon
2000; Werler and Dixon 2000).

II. Environmental Setting

Numerous avian species are found within this region of Texas. Some of the year-round residents of this
region of Texas are the great blue heron, black vulture, turkey vulture, red-tailed hawk, killdeer, rock
dove, mourning dove, greater roadrunner, belted kingfisher, red-headed woodpecker, pileated
woodpecker, blue jay, American crow, tufted titmouse, Carolina wren, eastern bluebird, American robin,
northern mockingbird, and the loggerhead shrike (Dickinson 1999; Sibley 2000; Texas Ornithological
Society [TOS] 1995).
Many other species of birds migrate through the region in the spring and fall, including such summer
residents as the snowy egret, green heron, common nighthawk, chimney swift, eastern kingbird, scissortailed flycatcher, purple martin, barn swallow, painted bunting, and dickcissel. The bald eagle is a regular
migrant and winter resident in the eastern half of the state. The mallard and spotted sandpiper are both
migratory winter residents that are also expected to occur within the area. Numerous other migrating
species such as arctic shorebirds wintering on the Gulf coast, northern passerines wintering in Central
America, and raptors and waterfowl, pass through or over the region during spring and fall migrations
(Dickinson 1999; Sibley 2000; TOS 1995).
Mammals of this region include the Virginia opossum, least shrew, eastern mole, eastern red bat,
Seminole bat, evening bat, nine-banded armadillo, eastern cottontail, swamp rabbit, eastern gray squirrel,
eastern fox squirrel, eastern flying squirrel, Baird’s pocket gopher, hispid pocket mouse, beaver, fulvous
harvest mouse, cotton mouse, white-footed mouse, hispid cotton rat, eastern woodrat, coyote, red fox,
gray fox, common raccoon, mink, striped skunk, bobcat, and white-tailed deer (Davis and Schmidly 1994;
Schmidly 1983). Black bear historically ranged in this region of Texas but were extirpated early in the
twentieth century.
A comparison of Hubbs (1982), Hubbs et al. (1991), and Lee et al. (1980) indicate that the geographic
ranges of approximately 100 species of freshwater fish could occur in the region. Common game fish that
may occur in the larger streams within this region of Texas include the largemouth bass, white crappie,
black crappie, white bass, channel catfish, and several species of sunfish. Other fish common to this
region include common carp, smallmouth buffalo, spotted gar, and longnose gar.

III. CULTURAL BACKGROUND
San Jacinto County is within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region (Perttula 1993). By the close of
the Pleistocene, hunter-gatherers, referred to as Paleoindians, roamed over much of North America.
During the Archaic period, population density and economic diversification are thought to have increased
while a mobile hunting and gathering subsistence strategy was maintained. During the Early Ceramic
period, sandy paste ceramics were introduced, though this does not necessarily indicate changes in
subsistence. Agriculture and increased sedentism are thought to have got their start during the Late
Prehistoric period.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The Paleoindian period (10,000–7000 B.C.) is the earliest generally accepted cultural period in the New
World and includes populations that inhabited most, if not all, of North America by the end of the
Pleistocene epoch. During the Pleistocene, the Texas coastline extended as much as 40 km into the
present Gulf of Mexico, and rivers cut deep canyons into sediments deposited during previous periods of
glaciation (Aten 1983). Coinciding with the decline of the Wisconsin glaciation, the early part of the
Paleoindian period is characterized by a relatively cool, moist climate that was conductive to now-extinct
species of Pleistocene megafauna, such as Bison antiquus figginsi. This period is sometimes called the
Big Game Hunting tradition (Willey 1966), due to a presumed heavy reliance by Paleoindian people on
megafauna as a food source during the earlier portion of the period. These conclusions are based on welldocumented exploitation of megafauna in the western United States and evidence of the presence of
similar species in North Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (Slaughter and Hoover 1963).
However, excavations at the Aubrey site (41DN479) in north central Texas have indicated that
subsistence efforts did not focus on big game animals alone. Rather, the entire range of available fauna
was utilized by the occupants of the site. These included bison, deer, rabbit, squirrel, fish, and turtle
(Ferring 1989; Ferring and Yates 1997). Whether this pattern of a more generalized foraging subsistence
system is characteristic of Clovis adaptations to this region remains to be documented. Ferring and Yates
(1997) suggest that, in general, the Clovis people probably employed “very flexible adaptive strategies.”
Many archeologists now believe that while Paleoindian people did use megafauna as part of their diet, the
correlation between the two has been exaggerated (Bryant and Shafer 1977; Johnson 1977).

100011542/090224

III. Cultural Background

Paleoindian occupation of the region during the terminal Pleistocene is evidenced by the recovery of
several types of well-made, lanceolate, parallel-flaked projectile points from archeological contexts in
Tyler, San Augustine, and Angelina counties. Evidence of this culture has also been found in the Addicks
Reservoir basin in Harris County (Patterson 1979; Wheat 1953) and at several sites within and near the
Galveston Bay vicinity. Projectile point types such as Scottsbluff, Clovis, Plainview, Angostura, and
possibly San Patrice are considered characteristic of the Paleoindian culture.
Archeological evidence synthesized by Story et al. (1990) from numerous counties comprising the greater
Gulf Coastal Plain in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma support the suggestion that the early
cultures of the Paleoindian period probably existed in small nuclear families or bands that migrated
widely in pursuit of seasonal resources.

ARCHAIC PERIOD
Cultural developments appear to have progressed beyond those of the Paleoindian period with the onset
of the Holocene epoch, when changes in the world climate caused sea levels to rise, inland prairies to
expand, and regional weather patterns to become more variable (Aten 1983). Overall, the climate became
warmer and drier and is characterized by the disappearance of the megafauna. Generally termed the
Archaic (7000–200 B.C.), this next period of cultural development has been further subdivided into Early,
Middle, and Late stages based on changes observed in the archeological record that appear to coincide
with episodic shifts in the Holocene climate and environment. Indications suggest that the Early Archaic
inhabitants of this area developed a more generalized hunting and gathering economy than had been
present during the previous Paleoindian times (Prikryl 1990). A variety of small game animals, including
deer and rabbit, were hunted, while edible roots, nuts, and fruits were gathered. This subsistence strategy
maintained the nomadic hunting-gathering lifestyle from the earlier Paleoindian period.
Despite a general paucity of intact Early and Middle Archaic components at sites in southeast Texas,
Archaic lithic technologies appear to show an increased diversity of functional types and styles over those
associated with the Paleoindian period, while the level of craftsmanship and the use of fine exotic
materials appear to have declined. In addition, the greater array of Archaic projectile point styles appears
to reflect a greater degree of regional specificity (Story et al. 1990). From these apparent changes in the
lithic technologies of Archaic cultures, Story et al. (1990) surmise that Archaic period human populations
may have become more dense with individual bands covering less overall territory on their seasonal
rounds.
In east and southeast Texas, the projectile point that most frequently typifies the Early Archaic
assemblage is the San Patrice (Shafer 1974; Shafer and Stearns 1975), which characteristically exhibits
triangular or leaf-shaped blades, is nearly always thinned at the base, and somewhat resembles the Dalton
type (Goodyear 1974) and Meserve type (Suhm and Jelks 1962).
Much of the data about the Middle Archaic is derived from investigations at Lake Conroe (Shafer 1968),
Lake Livingston (McClurken 1968), Lake Limestone (Prewitt and Mallouf 1977), and the Allens Creek
100011542/090224

III. Cultural Background

Project area (Hall 1981). Overall, this period is characterized by expanding- and parallel-stemmed dart
points such as Evans, Edgewood, Ellis, Lone Oak, Palmillas, Trinity, and Yarbrough.
Sites dating to the Late Archaic period tend to be more abundant and are usually located on sandy knolls
and other high terraces along perennial streams (Shafer et al. 1975). Many have been found within the
confines of the various reservoir projects of east and southeast Texas (Hall 1981; McClurken 1968;
Prewitt and Mallouf 1977; Shafer 1966) and as a consequence have been subjected to a considerable
amount of excavation and analysis. Typically, Late Archaic sites tend to be relatively small and only
rarely contain specialized tools or specific indicators of subsistence technology. During the Late Archaic,
dramatically increased population densities may have occurred concurrently with possible changes in the
natural and cultural environment (McGregor 1987, 1993). This population increase has been postulated
based on the increased number and size of sites that can be dated to this period. Another change that
occurred during this time and that may support the hypothesis of increased population is that lithic
artifacts were overwhelmingly made of local materials. This is a change from the Paleoindian and Early
and Middle Archaic in which nonlocal lithic materials were more common. However, these studies were
based on sites farther west of the area, although patterns similar to what has been seen on the edge of the
prairies are evident in East Texas as well.

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD
The advent of the Early Ceramic period (200 B.C.–A.D. 800) actually heralds few changes. Shafer et al.
(1975) argue that patterns developed during the Archaic effectively remain in place with the only
alteration being the addition of ceramics to the technological repertoire. Sites are numerous and are
usually located on sandy knolls or ridges and along the edges of stream valleys. Assumed utilized floral
and faunal resources that have been identified at archeological sites in this region include hickory, walnut,
pignut, deer, raccoon, tortoise, bison, and fish. No evidence has been found of long-term or permanent
settlements that might support horticulture. Initially, the lithic assemblage of the Early Ceramic was
dominated by contracting-stem projectile points such as the Gary type, with rectangular-stemmed types,
such as the Kent type, continuing.
Ceramic sequences derived from the Sabine Lake and Trinity delta areas indicate that the ceramics were
principally an indigenous development, although they may be technologically related to the Tchefuncte
culture. Most of the early vessels of southeast Texas are sandy paste hemispherical bowls and cylindrical
jars with round and sometimes flat bases. Decorations are usually rare and, when they occur, are typically
in the form of incised lines, punctations, and lip notching (Shafer 1974). Despite a halting start, area
residents achieved a firmer grasp of ceramic technology by the middle of the Early Ceramic period.
The Early Ceramic cultural development in southeastern Texas shows similarities with developments
related to Woodland culture manifestations of the southeastern United States. Shafer (1974) states that
sandy paste ceramics and the Gary point lithic tradition represent a local Woodland manifestation that
was involved in Hopewell interaction and continued after its demise until the historic period, when it was
represented by the indigenous Bidai, Deadose, Patiri, and Akokia cultures.

III. Cultural Background

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
The Late Prehistoric period in the western portions of the upper Texas coast spans the time between
approximately A.D. 800 and 1500. With the exception of the use of the bow and arrow, there is little
evidence for significant cultural change from the preceding Early Ceramic and Later Archaic times during
the early part of this period. The period is marked technologically by the appearance of arrow points,
notably of the Scallorn and, later, the Perdiz types. There does appear to have been a population increase,
as evidenced by the higher artifact density and more-numerous hearth features associated with Late
Prehistoric–age deposits.

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD
The time between initial contact and European influence among Native American populations is highly
varied and poorly documented. This time period is therefore referred to as the Protohistoric period (A.D.
1500–1700). The first record of Europeans encountering native groups in east Texas was the account
written by Cabeza de Vaca in 1528, documenting the experiences of him and the survivors of the De Soto
expedition in 1542 living for 8 years among indigenous peoples. According to Newcomb (1961), the main
indigenous Indian groups in southeast Texas at the time were the Bidais, Deadose, Patiri, and Akokisa.
These groups were closely related and spoke the Atakapan language. By the end of the nineteenth
century, these indigenous groups were gone from Texas (Newcomb 1961). A small immigrant Native
American population composed of Alabama and Koasati (Coushatta) managed to maintain a presence in
east Texas. This group is discussed further in the following section.

HISTORIC PERIOD
Alabama-Coushatta
The Alabama tribe was first referenced in 1541 by Hernando de Soto (Martin 2009). It was not until the
French began to become more of a presence in the area, around 1714, that contact was made again.
During this time, they lived in current-day Alabama. They remained in that area until around 1766. At this
time, overhunting of white-tailed deer in the area created a strain on environmental resources and the
tribes began to move westward. By the 1780s, the Alabamas and Coushattas were living along the Sabine
River and had begun to settle on the Trinity River. During this period, the Spanish had control of Texas
and were quite welcoming of the tribes. In many ways, the Spanish used the Alabama-Coushatta as a first
line of defense against the French, and then the United States. By the 1830s, there were three large
communities that had been established in northwestern Tyler County and several others that were later
inundated by the creation of Lake Livingston.
Although the Alabama-Coushatta tended to be peaceful, there were several instances of them fighting
other tribal groups when defending their territory (Martin 2009). During the Texas Revolution, the
Alabama-Coushatta provided help to Texas settlers fleeing toward the Sabine River in an incident known
as the “Runaway Scrape.” Later, Sam Houston asked for assistance from the Alabama-Coushatta in
100011542/090224

fighting the Mexican army. However, before negotiations with the tribe were completed, the Battle of San
Jacinto had been won.
Although Sam Houston was friendly toward all native tribes, his successor, Mirabeau B. Lamar, was not
(Martin 2009). Overall, he pushed toward the extirpation of Native Americans, except for the AlabamaCoushatta. With the Alabama-Coushatta tribes, he remained friendly and encouraged settlers living near
them to adopt the same attitude. It is uncertain why Lamar’s general Indian policies did not extend to the
Alabama-Coushatta tribe, but he even went as far as to grant the two tribes 2 leagues of land. However,
due to miscommunication, the tribes thought the survey was for white settlers and began to move into
other regions of Texas instead.
In 1853, Chief Antone, along with subchiefs and prominent citizens of Polk County, petitioned the Texas
legislature for land (Martin 2009). Because of this, the Alabama tribe was awarded 1,110.7 acres and the
Coushattas were awarded 640 acres in 1855. The two tribes continued to interact, and more Coushattas
began to move onto Alabama reservations, causing more people to see the two groups as one. Because of
the continued good relations between white settlers and the Alabama-Coushatta, the tribe continued to
help in military situations. During the Civil War, the Sixth Brigade, Second Texas Infantry was formed
from approximately 130 Alabama-Coushatta volunteers. Although they did not fight in any battle, they
performed the necessary task of safely moving supplies for troops along the Trinity River.
After the Civil War, the Alabama-Coushattas suffered. Reorganization from Reconstruction, along with
an influx of white settlers and an increase in forest harvesting, meant that the tribe and their needs were
largely ignored. In 1876, a section of their land was granted to the International-Great Northern Railroad
because the surveyor from 1854 failed to file the necessary paperwork. However, by 1880, things began
to improve. Several railroads now ran through Polk County, and the lumber industry picked up. Many of
the Indians began to work as lumberers, increasing their economic stability. At the same time, Christianity
and education started to play an important role. The first Presbyterian mission was established on the
reservation in 1881, and the early missionaries were teachers, establishing schools, ministers, doctors, and
nurses. The relationship between the church and the Alabama-Coushattas flourished, causing an increase
in prosperity for the tribe.
Another important change at this time involved J.C. Feagin, a lawyer interested in aiding the tribe through
the introduction of bills to Congress. The main purpose of these bills was to convince the government that
the Polk County Indians needed aid. Although the bill was rejected twice, in 1910 the Sixty-first Congress
appointed William Loker as commissioner, assigned to look into the needs of the Alabama-Coushatta. His
report encouraged the government to grant up to 5,000 acres of land and to build a school for manual
training in order to make the tribe more self-sufficient. Although nothing was done in 1910, Loker laid
the groundwork for future endeavors. Then in 1934, under the Indian Reorganization Act, the tribes were
allowed to begin organizing their own federal charters and welfare. It was at this time that they officially
became the Alabama-Coushatta, joining the two tribes together on paper. By 1939, the constitutions and
bylaws of the tribe had been ratified, and in 1955, the federal government released the trusteeship of the
100011542/090224

11

III. Cultural Background

tribe’s land and assets to the state of Texas. This lasted until 1987, when the federal government again
assumed responsibility for the Alabama-Coushatta.
Today, the Alabama-Coushatta has a governing body consisting of seven members elected by the tribe.
Although there is still a chief, he acts in an advisory manner and only votes to break a tie. The reservation
contains two churches, several shops, and recreational campgrounds. These campgrounds include a 26acre reservoir, camping areas, picnic areas, and nature trails. This has become a major economic source
for the tribe, bringing in approximately 200,000 visitors a year. Also, every year, a powwow is held
during June, which results in more tourists.

Euro-Americans
The Pineywoods of East Texas were obviously capable of supporting resident indigenous populations. To
a large extent, however, the arriving Euro-Americans had a more difficult time. The rolling, forested
landscape was not particularly suited to large-scale agriculture. Some members of Stephen F. Austin’s
First Colony settled along the San Jacinto River in 1824, and cattle ranching and timbering became the
principal economic mainstays. Later, oil and gas exploration beginning near Beaumont in the early part of
this century significantly altered the economic picture of the area, but not necessarily its settlement
pattern. The population of the region followed a traditional dispersed single-family rural homesite and
small hamlet pattern with an overlay of oil- and gas-related industrial activities.
Within present-day San Jacinto County, Euro-Americans began settling in the area during the 1820s
(Woestman 2009). Overall the population stayed fairly small due to the slow development of
transportation. The area did include a post office that was established in Coldspring (formerly known as
Coonskin) in 1847. Despite the low Euro-American population, San Jacinto County was officially
established in 1870 with Coldspring as the county seat. During the 1850s, steamboats on the Trinity River
were the main form of travel in the area. The steamboats were also an important part of the economy,
enabling farmers to get their cotton crops to market. However, steamboats did not often make trips along
the Trinity River, and it wasn’t until 1871, when several ferries were established in the area, that
transportation beyond horses became more feasible. Then, in 1881, the Houston, East, and West Texas
Railroad was constructed along the southeastern corner of the county. The timber industry figured
importantly in the development of the county and Coldspring. Between the 1880s and 1920s, almost 6
million acres of timber were cut. The Delta Land and Timber Company built a commissary there in 1926
(Wooster 2002). The Civilian Conservation Corps established a camp for black youths in 1930 and
operated it until 1937. The Coldspring Oil Field was discovered in 1945.
Overall, the population of the area stayed relatively low (Woestman 2009). Early schools were
established, but poorly attended. The main reason for this was due to the fact that most schools were
private and students commonly dropped out to work or could not afford to go. In many ways, religion
played a more prominent role in the county history. Although several churches were built in the area,
many were difficult for the people to reach. For this reason, during the late 1800s, camp meeting became
popular. Usually held during the summer months, a campground would be cleared beginning months in
100011542/090224

12

III. Cultural Background

advance and eventually a large shed, called a “brush arbor” was constructed. These religious camp
meetings would bring large numbers of people into the area. It was not until the 1900s, when
transportation began to improve greatly, that these style meetings made camping unnecessary and the
practice ceased.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
The Smithsonian Institution River Basin Survey program conducted some of the earliest archeological
investigations in the project vicinity prior to the construction of Addicks Reservoir in Harris County.
Surveys were also conducted in the late 1940s along Buffalo Bayou and several of its tributaries (Wheat
1953). Wheat also recorded and tested several archeological sites where he obtained data that resulted in
the definition of the Galveston Bay focus. Other results of that work included the development of a
relative chronological sequence for the area, based on lithic typology (Suhm et al. 1954).
During the 1960s, archeological investigations were conducted for Lake Livingston Reservoir, which
encompassed portions of Polk, San Jacinto, Trinity, and Walker counties (Nunley 1963). At the time of
this survey, archeological sites were recorded within and adjacent to the then-proposed lake. Seven of the
sites recorded were subsequently tested during 1965 and 1966 (McClurken 1968). Other archeological
investigations near this study area include the Lake Conroe investigations in Montgomery County
(McNatt 1978; Shafer 1968; Shafer and Stearns 1975). An archeological assessment of the Big Thicket
National Preserve conducted in 1974 and 1975 recorded 12 sites: 11 prehistoric and 1 multicomponent
prehistoric and historic (Shafer et al. 1975).
The Archeological Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University (Ensor and Carlson 1988) conducted
excavations at the Crawford site (41PK69) during 1984 and 1985. In 1986, and again in 1988,
archeological investigations were conducted in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Galveston District’s maintenance dredging of the river south of Liberty. During the 1986 survey (Prewitt
et al. 1986), several sites were recorded and subsequently tested in 1987 by Coastal Environments, Inc.
(Weinstein et al. 1988). Four of the tested sites (41CH273, 41CH274, 41LB54, and 41LB55) were
determined eligible for the NRHP and were later subjected to mitigation by Espey, Huston & Associates,
Inc. (EH&A, now PBS&J) (Nash and Rogers 1992).
EH&A conducted NRHP testing at site 41OR58 between December 1990 and January 1991 (Rogers et al.
1991). A survey conducted in Walker County for the proposed Huntsville Fish Hatchery recorded nine
archeological sites (Davis et al. 1994). Other small-scale investigations have also been conducted for
water and sewer improvements in San Jacinto County (Corbin 1993) and/or oil and gas interests (Moore
1993). A survey of B.A. Steinhagern Lake in Tyler County was also completed (Horizon Environmental
Services 1996). Additionally, testing has been conducted in San Jacinto County at site 41SJ13 (Wood
1991) and in Walker County at site 41WA185 (Gadus and Fields 1997).

III. Cultural Background

Previously Recorded Sites within 1 Mile
A literature and records review was conducted for the proposed study area during October 2009. Known
cultural resources sites within or adjacent to the study area were plotted on 1:24,000 U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) topographic maps. The cultural resource site files at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) at The University of Texas at Austin and at the THC were reviewed for sites located
in the study area. A search was conducted of both published and unpublished NRHP data for sites in or
determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The list of State Archeological Landmarks (SAL)
determined significant by the state was also consulted.
The available records at TARL and the THC revealed seven cultural resource sites within 1 mile of the
project area (Table 1). One cultural resources site (41SJ182) is mapped within the proposed transmission
line centerline. Site 41SJ182 was recorded in 2002 as an unknown prehistoric site consisting of only a
surface scatter of flakes. The site is located on a sandy hill overlooking Palmetto Creek in a disturbed area
used as a sand quarry. No recommendations for further work were made, and the site was described as not
considered eligible for listing in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL. However, the recorder suggested
that cultural materials were possibly found on the other side of FM 980.
Six cultural resource sites are recorded within 1-mile on each side of the proposed project area. Site
41SJ95 is located on a sandy ridge north of Palmetto Creek. The site was recorded in 1969. Artifacts
observed at the site were limited to one projectile point and one pottery sherd. No recommendations were
made regarding potential NRHP eligibility of the site.
Site 41SJ103, discovered in 1969 during the Lake Livingston investigations, is described as on a sandy
slope with a small flat area on both sides of Pool’s Creek and both sides of a tributary of Pool’s Creek.
Artifacts observed at the site included 23 arrow points, 2 dart points, plain pottery, shell-tempered pottery,
1 iron object, bone, and burned rock. No recommendations were made regarding the NRHP eligibility of
the site.
Site 41SJ105, also recorded in 1969 during the Lake Livingston investigations, is described as located on
a sandy ridge bank of Pool’s Creek. Artifacts recorded from the site include petrified palm, arrow points,
bone, mussel shell, snail shell, plain pottery, and shell-tempered pottery. No recommendations were made
regarding the NRHP eligibility of the site; however, the records on file at TARL list the site as a SAL.
Site 41SJ109 recorded during the Lake Livingston investigations in 1969 is located on a bank of Brook’s
Creek. The area was described as a manufacturing area for stone implements. Artifacts recorded at the site
include chips, flakes, pottery, snail shell, burned rock, a dart point, an arrow point, and burned bone. No
recommendations on the NRHP eligibility of the site were made.

*Information is from THC Atlas

Site 41SJ135 is located on a sandy ridge that used to be the old bank of the Trinity River and is described
as dissected in half by a small creek. The site was recorded in 1969 during the Lake Livingston
investigations. Artifacts observed at the site included dart points, pottery, and mussel shell. No
recommendations regarding potential NRHP eligibility of the site were made.
Site 41SJ137 is located on a knoll ridge 300 ft (100 m) from Brown’s Creek. The site was located during
the Lake Livingston project in 1969. The site is a rockshelter that showed evidence of hearth pits and
charred wood. Also found in the area were palm chips and flakes. No mention was made regarding NRHP
eligibility.
Site 41SJ182 was recorded in 2002 as part of a personal project. It is located on a primary terrace north of
Palmetto Creek. In relation to the project area, the site is approximately 5–10 m south of the area of
potential effect. When first recorded, several flakes were found on the surface, but no diagnostics were
present. The site was listed as not eligible for NRHP status. When working in the project area, it was
noted by field archeologists that the site area now contains a gravel road and is heavily disturbed. It is
unlikely any material remains.
No NRHP-listed, or determined eligible for listing, or SAL-designated sites were identified within the
proposed transmission line centerline.

IV. METHODS
PRIMARY GOALS
The purpose of the survey was to (1) locate and record all archeological resources that may be within the
survey corridor; (2) assess their significance and eligibility for listing in the NRHP and for designation as
a SAL, and (3) provide site-specific recommendations for additional archeological research, as
appropriate.

RECORDS REVIEW
The files at TARL and the THC were examined for the location of previously recorded archeological
sites, NRHP-listed and determined-eligible properties, and SAL-designated properties within the survey
corridor. All previously recorded sites located on the USGS quadrangles on which the survey corridor is
located were plotted on the USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle maps.

FIELD METHODS
The survey corridor was located within pine plantations, mixed hardwood and pine forests, and
pastureland. From mile marker one to approximately mile marker three, the survey corridor paralleled
FM 980 on the east side. The remainder of the area cut through pasture and pine plantation.
The project archeologist first examined every survey area on topographic maps and aerial photographs
prior to initiating fieldwork in a given parcel to determine high probability areas (HPAs) and the
appropriate level of shovel testing. These assessments were based on criteria reflecting the probability
that intact evidence of cultural occupation might be present, including such factors as the dependability of
water sources, the degree of surface disturbance, slope gradient, and likelihood of seasonal inundation.
Shovel tests were placed in one transect at approximate 30-m (100-ft) intervals within the survey corridor,
or up to 100-m (328-ft) intervals depending on the judgment of the principal investigator or project
archeologist and experienced crew chiefs in the field. Slopes with greater than 25 percent gradient or
severely disturbed, inundated, and eroded areas were only shovel tested at the discretion of the principal
investigator or crew chief and noted on the field maps.
When cultural resource sites were found during shovel testing or based upon surface observations
(including historic architecture), additional shovel tests were then placed at 10–15-m intervals between
the survey transects in all four cardinal directions or on an axis based upon the prevailing terrain when
able. Since access was not granted outside of the proposed ROW, some site delineation was limited to a
single transect. Site boundaries were determined by the excavation of two consecutive negative shovel
tests in any cardinal direction, or the presence of slopes with greater than 15 percent gradient or severely
disturbed, inundated, and eroded areas. No artifacts were collected; all were replaced where found, either
on the surface or reburied in the shovel test.
100011542/090224

16

IV. Methods

The cultural resources survey was performed by teams of two PBS&J archeologists, each team containing
one crew chief designated by the principal investigator. Each archeologist was equipped with a shovel,
6.3-millimeter (mm) (0.25-inch)-mesh hand screen, compass, PBS&J shovel test and photographic logs,
daily journal forms, and TARL site forms. Each crew was equipped with topographic maps and aerial
photographs of the survey corridor, a digital camera, a GeoXT Trimble Global Positioning System (GPS)
device, and a cellular telephone.
The shovel tests measured approximately 30 centimeters (cm) (12 inches) in plan and were excavated by
natural strata where possible, or in intervals not exceeding 10 cm (4 inches). Shovel tests were excavated
to a depth where pre-Holocene sterile substrates were encountered, if possible, although disturbed
conditions and shallow clay subsoil precluded penetration below approximately 30 centimeters below the
surface (cmbs) (12 inches) in some locations, while other locations had soils that were deeper that 1 m.
All soil matrices were sifted through 6.3-mm (0.25-inch)-mesh hardware cloth unless the matrix was
dominated by clay. Clayey matrix was finely divided by trowel and visually inspected.
For each of the shovel tests, the following information was recorded on PBS&J shovel test logs: location,
maximum depth, and the number of soil strata. For each soil stratum, thickness, texture, color, and the
presence or absence and nature of cultural materials were recorded. All shovel tests were backfilled upon
completion.

100011542/090224

17

V. SURVEY RESULTS
Most of the landforms contained within the survey corridor are upland landforms with little or no
potential for alluvial or colluvial deposition. Moderate to severe erosion and disturbances resulting from a
nearby highway and transmission line corridor occur along part of the alignment, as well as livestock
trampling, historic logging, and human landscape modifications. A total of 76 shovel tests were excavated
during the cultural resources survey. Of these shovel tests, 73 were culturally sterile while 3 were positive
for prehistoric artifacts only. Three new sites were recorded: 41SJ220, 41SJ221 (Ethician Cemetery), and
42SJ222 (Catahoula Outcrop).
The project area consists of approximately 7.3 linear miles (11.8 km), of which 1.8 miles (24 percent)
were considered HPAs and 0.8 mile (11 percent) were considered LPAs, while the remainder was
considered MPAs. A total of 63 shovel tests were excavated within the HPAs for an average of 23 shovel
tests per linear mile.

SITE 41SJ220
Site 41SJ220 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on the terrace approximately 40 m northwest of Zwicky
Creek, a seasonal stream (Figure 2). FM 980 is approximately 50 m to the east. No artifacts were
observed on the surface. A total of seven shovel tests were excavated in delineation of the site. Three of
the shovel tests were positive, while the remaining four shovel tests contained no cultural material,
indicating a site about 30 m in length east-west along the surveyed corridor. Due to the small width of the
project corridor in the north-south direction, only the east-west direction could be tested. Soils in the area
are mapped as Oakhurst fine sandy loam, although the fine sandy loam surface soil is much deeper than is
typical of the soil type. This is likely due to colluvial erosion from the top of the terrace, historic logging
activities, or the construction of the SHECO substation about 40 m to the north-northwest. Overall, the
surface soil ranged from 50 m to at least 100 m in depth. The majority of the artifacts were found where
the soils were the deepest.
From the three positive shovel tests, 11 small flakes were recovered (Table 2). Four artifacts were
recovered from Level 3 (20–30 cmbs), 2 were from Level 4 (30–40 cmbs), 1 was from Level 6 (50–
60 cmbs), 1 was from Level 8 (70–80 cmbs), and 3 were from Level 10 (90–100 cmbs). However, due to
vertical movement of artifacts in sandy soils and the possibility of natural or artificial redeposition, it is
difficult to determine the original location of the artifacts. None of the artifacts appeared to be utilized or
modified.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts or intact cultural deposits or features were located. It is unlikely that
more-intensive investigation will yield any significant amount of additional data. The site is not thought
to be eligible for listing in the NRHP or designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended for site
41SJ220.

Site 41SJ221 (Ethician Cemetery)
The Ethician Cemetery is a modern family cemetery located on the edge of a small knoll about 30 m west
of FM 980. The cemetery is located in a mixed pine and hardwood forested area that has been cleared by
both the landowner and survey crews.
Based on information from the official website for the cemetery it is considered a “green” cemetery and
thus only 1 percent of all burials are allowed to have any markings, i.e., headstones. There are currently
only six plots occupied and only two with stone markers, all interred since 2004. The cemetery is
immediately outside of the ROW. Located centrally at the presumed western edge of the cemetery is a
large wooden cross with two smaller wooden crosses on either side of it and a few meters back, which
appear to be headstones for two graves (Figure 3). These three crosses are the only means of recognition
from the road. A third grave location is indicated by a small berm about 10 m west of the marked graves.
A pedestrian survey was conducted of the area. No shovel testing was done in the area because of known
internment of bodies (Russell 2009).
The cemetery appears to be just east of the proposed ROW. However, as the official website for the
cemetery states that six burials are located at the cemetery and only three apparent grave locations are
visible, the possibility exists that some of the burials may be within the ROW. The cemetery does not
appear to be eligible for listing in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL. If the boundaries of the
cemetery cannot be established with confidence through coordination with the landowner, it is
recommended that monitoring be conducted of any construction activities within 100 ft of the cemetery
location.

Site 41SJ222 (Catahoula Outcrop)
Site 41SJ222 (the Catahoula Outcrop) is a natural rock outcrop located on a sloped terrace approximately
50 m south of Pool’s Creek, and immediately east of FM 980 (Figure 4). The outcrop is located on the
edge of a mixed pine and hardwood forested area and is approximately 22 x 23 m in size and consists of

several large boulders of moderately coarse metaquartzite. The surface was subjected to a thorough
pedestrian survey. Numerous photographs were taken to document the sizes of the boulders and the
location. Inspection of the outcrop gave no significant signs of cultural use, although a few flake scars
were observed on the boulders suggesting the site functioned as a lithic procurement location. One
probable flake was found near the outcrop but was of a different material from the outcropping rocks so
its origin is questionable. Shovel testing was done on the terrace directly south of the outcrop. No cultural
materials were recovered from shovel tests.
The site is not thought to be eligible for listing in the NRHP or designation as a SAL. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts or intact cultural deposits or features were located. Although the site is a prominent
topographic feature, its limited usage indicates that it is unlikely that more-intensive investigation will
yield any significant amount of additional data. The site is not thought to be eligible for the NRHP. No
further work is recommended.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The cultural resource investigation included a pedestrian archeological survey augmented by shovel
testing and an oral interview with the landowner. Three cultural resource sites were located and recorded
(Table 3). Two sites are prehistoric in nature—site 41SJ220, a lithic scatter, and site 41SJ222, the
Catahoula Outcrop, a lithic procurement site. The third site is 41SJ221, the Ethician Cemetery, a modern
cemetery. None of the sites are considered to be eligible for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation as they
exist within the corridor surveyed. The two prehistoric sites are unlikely to have interpretable or datable
remains. No further investigation is recommended for site 41SJ220 or 41SJ222.
