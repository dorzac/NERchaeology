A cultural resource survey of a proposed disposal area was conducted on
28 March 1985 by Carolyn Good and Janelle Stokes assisted by Ed Mokry. The
Applicant proposes to dredge Packery Channel to a depth of -6.0 MLW and a
width of 50 to 70 feet. Approximately 35,000 cu yds of fine grained sand
will be removed by hydraulic dredge and placed in a leveed disposal area south
of the Park Road 53 bridge and west of Packery Channel. Maps of the project
area are Attachments A and B, and Shovel Test Forms are Attachment C.
At the time of survey, the proposed disposal area was found to consist of a
large dune field. Many of the dunes have been stabilized by vegetation consisting of low grasses and some light brush. Within the dune field is a maze
of sandflats. and freshwater ponds. Vegetation of the sandflats includes
glassworts and other low wetlands plants, while the freshwater ponds are filled
with cattails and rushes. Although a systematic survey was attempted, it was
difficult to maintain orientation and to accurately plot locations on the
7.5 1 USGS topographic quad. Ed Mokry commented that the size and location
of dunes changed dramatically after each storm (hurricane). Specifically,
he was aware of several major changes in the topography of the disposal area
during his lifetime, following major storms (he fishes Packery Channel).
Because of this dynamic nature, most effort was directed toward survey of
sandflats and blowouts, where historic or prehistoric materials might remain
relatively intact beneath the constantly moving dunes. A few of the dunes
were traversed with negative results. Eight shovel tests were conducted as
indicated on Attachment C.
A previously recorded site, 41NU6, is located in the proposed disposal area
(see Attachment B). T.N. Campbell originally reported the site in 1964, and
described it as wind deflated, producing arrow points and Rockport wares.
The plotting we obtained from TARL places the site immediately south of the
Park Road 53 bridge, and indicates it as being fairly extensive. At the
time of the current survey, the area indicated as 41NU6 was found to be a tidal
flat with excellent exposure. The area was intensively surveyed with negative
results, as was about ~ mi of beach along Packery Channel north of the bridge
(this area, which is outside the permit area, was surveyed in an attempt to
identify the location of the site). Approximately 200m south of the bridge,
however, prehistoric archeological remains were encountered along the channel
(east) side of a large dune at the water's edge. At this location, a light
scatter of bleached shell and several artifacts including ceramics and an
Ensor point were found. The shell was primarily oyster, with some conch and
moon shell. Modern shell is abundant, and it was difficult (if not impossible)
to distinguish naturally versus culturally deposited materials, Cultural
remains including the artifacts and a few bone fragments were found from the
beach along Packery Channel to about 1/3 up the side of the 8 to 10-foot dune
(about Sm east/west), and for a distance of about lOm north/south along the
beach and dune. There was no real concentration of material, and 2 shovel

tests (ST-2, -3; Attachment C), failed to identify in situ remains or additional
artifacts. To the west of these materials, on the west or backside of this
particular dune complex, a small scatter of bleached oyster shell which
included 2 small pieces of burned clay was found exposed about 2 feet above
the sandflats at the base of a small dune. The material was rather sparse,
and extended for about lOm along the dune. Two shovel tests were excavated
at this location with negative results (ST-6, -7; Attachment C). No in situ
deposits or artifacts were recovered (see Attachment B for location).
It is difficult to determine if these ephemeral and possibly redeposited
materials represent part of 41NU6. At the time Campbell recorded the site,
there was apparently a good deal more material present than we found, and
possibly in a different location than we observed. Given the difficulty in
mapping in this area, and the dramatic natural and man-made changes in the
landscape since Campbell's 1964 observations, we have chosen to include the
materials identified in this survey as part of 41NU6. We are dismayeft that
no intact deposits or real concentrations of material could be found. The area
where the materials described above were found was intensively surveyed with
negative results. It is concluded that in this area, the materials we
found do not represent potentially significant remains. Future researchers
should be cautioned that other areas of 41NU6 that may become exposed in
the future may have potentially significant remains, and should not dismiss
this site on the basis of this survey. An updated site form is Attachment D.
The base of a hand-blown glass bottle was found in the south central portion
of the permit area, but was not associated with any other historic remains.
A pile of concrete-like blocks was found in the northern portion of the permit
area near Park Road 53. These blocks do not represent a foundation, and are
believed to be debris from bridge construction. All other materials present
in the permit area represent modern trash from fishing, camping, and other
recreational use of the area.
In conclusion, ephemeral prehistoric archeological remains were found south
of the area previously identified as 41NU6. We have chosen to consider these
materials as part of that site. No in situ deposits or concentrations of
cultural remains could be identified, and no further work is recommended.
At this point in time, the remains we have described above and included as
part of 41NU6 do not appear to be eligible for the National Register of
Historic Places. No historic remains of potential significance were identified,
