ABSTRACT

At the request of the City of Eagle Pass, Blanton & Associates Inc., conducted an archaeological
survey of four segments of proposed right-of-way for water lines that are part of the Eagle Pass Regional
Water and Wastewater Facilities Plan. The combined segments extend from south of the city off of the El
Indio Highway (FM 1021) to north of the city and west of FM 1588, a total of 8.75 miles. Final easement
width is 15 feet for most of the project area; the temporary construction easement is 40 feet. The water
pipeline will be placed approximately five feet below the surface. Also included are two 1.5-acre water
tower pad sites. Total acreage of the surveyed area for the four segments and two tower pads is 45.5 acres.
Portions of all but the northern segment of the proposed right-of ways are in urban areas along
neighborhood roads, highways, irrigation canals, and are highly developed. The northern segment is in a
rural area. A 100% pedestrian survey was conducted by two archaeologists. Two previously recorded
sites are within the current project area. Pedestrian survey and shovel tests at 41MV102, located along
FM 1021, revealed very little evidence of prehistoric occupation and suggest that the site is not eligible
for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nor does it merit formal designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL). Site 41MV280, located in the northern segment on a hill overlooking
Elm Creek, is a lithic procurement/initial reduction site. As a result of the present survey, the site
boundaries were enlarged and an updated site form completed. Because the site is surficial and lacks
intact features further work is not thought necessary nor is the site thought to be eligible for listing on the
NRHP or as a SAL. One new prehistoric site was recorded in the northern segment - 41MV298,
consisting of four burned rock clusters, two of which are likely hearths as well as a light lithic scatter.
Shovel tests conducted here revealed no subsurface materials. Site 41MV298 apparently is also a surface
site with two small diffuse burned rock features and two more concentrated, larger burned rock features
or hearths. No further work is recommended for this site which is not thought to be eligible for the NRHP
or formal designation as a SAL. None of the artifacts noted at the above sites were collected for curation.

INTRODUCTION

In response to a request from the City of Eagle Pass Water Works System, archaeologists from
Blanton and Associates, Inc., conducted a survey of revised segments of proposed improvements to the
water distribution systems in and around the City of Eagle Pass in Maverick County, Texas. The original
water system improvements were defined in the Eagle Pass Regional Water and Wastewater Facilities
Plan and prepared by Tetra Tech, Inc., in February 2002. Amendment #1 to the original plan, also
prepared by Tetra-Tech, was completed in December of 2003. The regional water improvements are
being funded by the City of Eagle Pass, the Texas Water Development Board, the Border Environment
Cooperation Commission, and the North American Development Bank.
Survey was undertaken for those portions of the revised project which had not previously been
subjected to archaeological survey. The southeastern segment is 5.7 miles in length, the central segment is
.45 miles in length, the north central segment is .7 miles in length, and the northern segment is 1.9 miles
in length for a total of 8.75 miles (Figure 1). Water lines within these segments range from 8 to 24 inches
in diameter; the proposed lines will be buried at an average depth of approximately five feet. Construction
right-of-way width is 40 feet, while the permanent easement will be 15 feet along most segments. Also
included in the survey were two 1.5 acre water tower pad sites, located at Chula Vista, at the southern
extent of the project area, to the east of FM 1021, and in Deer Run, located at the northern extent of the
project area, northeast of Highway 277, and west of FM 1588 and the Southern Pacific Railroad. Water
will be pumped from these locations through a pipeline into the distribution system.
Funding for the project is being provided by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) in
conjunction with the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC), a bi-national agency within
the Department of the Interior that was formed just after the inception of NAFTA in 1993 to address the
environmental infrastructure along the U.S.-Mexico border, and the North American Development Bank,
another bi-national development agency. Since federal funds are involved in construction, the project falls
under the purview of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
The purpose of the NHPA is to protect significant cultural resources that may be threatened by actions
that are federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. This legislation, which creates
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
(ACHP) states that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when cultural resources eligible
for inclusion on the NRHP are present in an area affected by actions committed or funded by federal
agencies. The federal process is described in ACHP regulations 36 CFR 800. Preservation and protection
of cultural resources under federal law is linked to eligibility for the NRHP which is based on site
"significance" as defined by National Park Service regulations 36 CFR 60. The ACHP has the final say
with respect to the Section 106 process, which includes the identification, evaluation, and treatment of
significant properties and impacts, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and concurrence
by the appropriate agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by
the THC.
Other Federal legislation relevant to the historic preservation process includes the Antiquities Act
of 1906, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Archeological and Historic
Preservation Act of 1974, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (AIRFA), the
Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA), and the Native American Graves Protection
and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA). Executive Order 13007, which states that agencies must take
into account the effect of an undertaking on American Indian sacred sites, may also be applicable in
certain cases.

Cultural resources located on land owned or controlled by the state or its political subdivisions
are protected by the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) as articulated in Title 13, Part II of the Texas
Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of
State Archeological Landmarks and requires that governmental entities identify potential SALs through
survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially impact cultural resources. As a political
subdivision of the. state, the City of Eagle Pass, which will control easements for the various segments and
water tanks, is responsible for complying with provisions of the code. The code's provisions are
administered by the Division of Archeology of the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The
archaeological survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 3292, issued to Dr. Richard
Meadows.
The archaeological survey was undertaken in compliance with appropriate archaeological survey
methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and
Historic Preservation (NPS 1983), and the THC Archeological Survey guidelines (THC n.d.). The
primary goals of the survey was to identify and document cultural resources located within the project
area, evaluate the identified resources in terms of their eligibility for formal designation as an SAL and
listing on the NRHP, and should potentially significant resources be located, provide recommendations
for their evaluation, such as further archaeological testing, or management options such as avoidance or
preservation.
Archaeological survey of the proposed right-of-way was conducted in early December 2003 by
Dr. Richard Meadows and Dana Anthony. Dr. Meadows returned in January 2004 to shovel test
41MV102. Total time for completion of the survey, excluding travel, was 5 person days. Total acreage
surveyed for the project is 45.5 acres.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area lies near the extreme western edge of the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province (Fenneman 1938). Just to the north lies the Edwards Plateau region
(Fenneman 1931 ). The rolling hills of the Coastal Plain in this area are underlain by Upper Cretaceous
sediments. The major drainage basin of the area is the Rio Grande.
Maverick County has a subtropical steppe climate with mild winters and hot summers. Though
most of the annual precipitation falls between April and October, humidity in the summer months is
typically low. The average annual rainfall, based on the period from 1939-1968, is 19.52 inches but, as in
many arid areas, year to year variation is great, ranging from a high of 44.36 inches in 1900 to a low of
6.01 inches in 1956 (Stevens and Arriaga 1977:59). Southeasterly winds prevail throughout the year, with
occasional north and northwesterly winds ushering. in sudden, brief cold spells during the usually mild
and dry winters.
As mapped, the southern portion of the project area, along FM 1021, the El Indio Highway, the
proposed right-of-way includes the Late Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits, Pliocene or Pleistocene
Uvalde Gravels, and the Upper Cretaceous Escondido Formation (Barnes 1976). The terrace deposits
consist of gravel, sand, silt, and clay, materials similar to those present in contiguous alluvium. The
Escondido Formation is found on the higher landforms and is described as
Clay, sandstone, siltstone, and limestone. Upper part: fossiliferous siltstone, commonly
glauconitic, light gray; limestone, impure, yellow; thickness about 270 feet. Lower part:
mostly mudstone punctuated by sandstone units and divisible into three parts from top
down about 285, 145, and 175 feet thick respectively; sandstone, fine grained, yellowish
gray, medium to thick bedded, ripple marked, crossbedded, forms cuestas. Thickness of
formation about 200-875 feet, thickens southward (Barnes 1976).
The Uvalde Gravels are exposed on the hill at the site of the proposed Chula Vista water tower.
These gravels are described by Barnes (1976) as
Caliche-cemented gravel; well-rounded pebbles and cobbles of chert, some pebbles and
cobbles of quartz and igneous rocks; thickness up to about 30 feet, occurs in part as lag
gravel.
The short central portion of the survey area, at the northern end of the City of Eagle Pass, is
underlain by the Upper Cretaceous Olmos Formation (Barnes 1976). It is
Clay, sandstone, and coal; irregularly stratified, interfingering lenses of sandstone and
clay, ferruginous concretions and silicified wood common; chief coal seam about 6 feet
thick, poorly exposed; thickness 400-500 feet.
The north-central segment in the Seco Mines area and the far northern segment east of Elm
Creek, are also underlain by the Olmos Formation. There are small pockets of Uvalde Gravels mapped in
the latter segment where site 41MV280 was recorded.
The southern portion of the project area is mapped within two soil associations (Stevens and
Arriaga 1977). The Copita-Pryor-Dant soil association occurs in the vicinity of FM 1021 and is
characterized as nearly level to gently sloping and undulating, moderately deep and deep sandy clay
loams and clay loams. These soils are mapped at 41MV102. The Catarina-Maverick association, mapped
to the north and east of FM 1021, is described as gently sloping and gently undulating to undulating, deep
and moderately deep clays. The Catarina-Maverick soil association is also mapped in the central portion

of the project area, located to the east-southeast of the intersection of 277 and the 277 loop east of the
City of Eagle Pass. The north-central part of the project area, in the Seco Mines area, is also mapped as
Catarina-Maverick association. The northern part of the project, in the Deer Run area, is mapped as
Copita-Pryor-Dant, where newly recorded site 41MV298 is located, Jimenez-Olmos-Zapata, and
Catarina-Maverick association. The Jimenez-Olmos-Zapata association is described as rolling to
undulating, very shallow and shallow gravelly loams and loams (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). Site
41MV280 is located on this mapped association.
Eight soil series are mapped along the southern portion of the proposed and existing rights-ofway. Elindio, Maverick, and Copita soils are mapped in the southeastern section of the right-of-way,
extending from the Chula Vista water storage pad site to FM 1021. Catarina Association soils are also
found in this area. Along FM 1021, Montell and Pryor soils are the dominant series. Just west of the
Maverick County Canal, where the right-of-way turns to the north, Elindio soils are common while
Maverick and Verick soils are also mapped. The middle portion of the project area is mapped as Pryor
and Maverick soils. The north central portion of the project area is mapped as Copita, Elindio, and Pryor
soils. The northern portion of the project area is mapped as Elindio and Jimenez soils.
Elindio soils formed in calcareous alluvium. They are loamy, deep, nearly level to gently sloping
(Stevens and Arriaga 1977). In a typical profile of the series, the surface layer consists of dark grayishbrown silty clay loam about 15 inches thick. Below is a firm clay loam, brown in the upper 11 inches and
very pale brown in the lower 13 inches. There is about 5 percent mass of lime per volume. Elindio soils
are classed as fine-silty, mixed, active, hyperthermic Aridic Calciustolls (NRCS 2004).
Catarina soils are deep, gently undulating, calcareous, clayey soils that formed in saline clays and
shaly clays (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). The surface layer is grayish-brown clay about 22 inches thick.
Below, to a depth of 52 inches, is a very firm clay, grayish-brown in the upper 14 inches with a few lime
masses, and light yellowish-brown clay with a few masses and threads of salt in the lower 16 inches. The
underlying material extends to about 78 inches and is a pale-yellow clay that is about 5 percent lime
masses and 5 percent gypsum crystals. Catarina soils are classed as fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Sodic
Haplusterts (NRCS 2004).
Copita soils formed in loamy sediment over sandstone and are calcareous, moderately deep,
nearly level to gently sloping and gently undulating (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). In a typical profile the
surface layer is grayish brown sandy clay loam about 12 inches thick. Below, to a depth of 30 inches, is a
friable sandy clay loam, brown in the upper 9 inches, and pale-brown in the lower part. The next layer is a
5-inche thick very pale brown sandy clay loam that is about 15 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate.
The underlying material to a depth of about 60 inches is light-gray sandstone that has small amounts of
calcium carbonate. Copita soils are classed as fine-loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Aridic Calciustepts
(NRCS 2004).
Jimenez soils formed in beds of gravelly caliche and consist of very shallow to shallow, rolling
calcareous, very gravelly, loamy soils on old, high terraces (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). A typical profile
is comprised of 9 inches of dark grayish brown, very gravelly loam. This surface layer sits on thick beds
of caliche that also contain extensive gravels. Jimenez soils are classed as loamy-skeletal, mixed, active,
hyperthermic, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls (NRCS 2004).
Maverick soils were formed in marine shale and clay. They are moderately deep, gently sloping
and undulating, calcareous, saline, and clayey soils (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). The five-inch thick
surface layer is grayish-brown clay. Underlying this is 16 inches of light olive-brown, very firm clay that
has a few soft masses of and few threads of neutral salts. Below is 5 inches of pale-yellow clay that is
about 10 percent soft masses of lime with a few threads of salts and a few yellow and brownish-yellow

mottles. This is underlain by a pale yellow shale to a depth of 72 inches. Maverick soils are classed as
Fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Aridic Haplustepts (NRCS 2004).
Montell soils formed in calcareous clayey alluvium and are deep, nearly level soils on broad
uplands (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). In a typical profile the surface layers is gray clay approximately 28
inches. The next layer is 16 inches of grayish brown very firm clay. The underlying material, to a depth of
80 inches, is very pale brown clay. There is about 5 percent visible lime and gypsum. Montell soils are
classed as Fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Sodic Haplusterts (NRCS 2004).
Pryor soils are deep, nearly level to gently sloping and undulating that formed in calcareous,
loamy and clayey material over shale (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). In a representative profile, the surface
layer is grayish-brown clay loam about 8 inches thick. The underlying layer, which extends to 42 inches,
features pale brown, firm clay loam in the upper 10 inches, yellowish brown firm clay in the next 12
inches, and light yellowish brown firm clay loam in the lower 12 inches. A pale yellow clayey shale with
a few soft masses of calcium carbonate and a few gypsum crystals is the underlying material to a depth of
72 inches. Pryor soils are classed as fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Ustertic Haplargids (NRCS 2004).
Verick series consists of loamy, shallow, gently sloping to sloping and undulating soils that
formed in interbedded calcareous sandstone material (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). In a typical profile, the
surface layer is about 6 inches thick, brown, very friable fine sandy loam. Below, the layer is about 9
inches thick, pale-brown, friable sandy clay loam. To a depth of 50 inches, the underlying material is
weakly cemented, calcareous sandstone with a small amount of visible lime. Verick soils are classed as
loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic, shallow Aridic Haplustalfs (NRCS 2004).
The county lies within Blair's (1950) Tamaulipan biotic province. The semiarid, megathermal
Tamaulipan Province has a distinctive vegetation marked by brushy species which disappear or decrease
notably north of the province boundary. The fauna includes a number of grassland species that range
northward into the Texan and Kansan provinces as well as species that are found in common with the
adjacent Austroriparian and Chihuahuan provinces. The Tamaulipan in unique among the Texas
provinces in having a neotropical element. Many of these species are more prominent at the southernmost
tip of Texas that Blair (1950) suggests might be included within his suggested Matamoran district.
Following Johnston (1963), Hatch et al. (1990:13-14) describe the original vegetation of the
South Texas Plains as an "open grassland or savannah-type along the coastal areas and brushy chaparralgrassland in the uplands." The region has seen considerable vegetation change in the historic era, with a
dramatic increase of brushy species the result of historic grazing practices (Inglis 1964).0nce less
prominent, woody species have increased their range significantly throughout the South Texas Plains
during the historic era. These species include mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), live oak (Quercus
virginiana), acacia (Acacia sp.), brazil (Zizyphus obviata), spiny hackberry (Ce/tis pallida), whitebrush
(Aloysia gratissima), lime pricklyash (Zanthoxylum fagara), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana),
shrubby blue sage (Salvia ballotiflora), and lotebush (Zizyphus obtusifolia). Dominant grasses of the oak
savannah of South Texas include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), indiangrass (Sorghastrum
nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), crinkleawn (Trachypogon secundus), and various species of
Paspalum. In addition to the widespread pricklypear (Opuntia sp.), common forbs include bush
sunflowers (Simsia sp.), orange zexmania (Wedelia hispida), shrubby oxalis (Oxalis berlanderi), white
milkwort (Polygala alba), Amercan snoutbean (Rhynchosia americana), and greenthread (Thelesperma
nuecense).

CULTURAL SETTING
PREIDSTORIC CULTURE IDSTORY

The Maverick County project area falls within the Rio Grande Plains biogeographical area of the
South Texas Plains cultural region (Black 1989:39). The larger cultural region is very close to the extent
of Blair's (1950) Tamaulipan biotic zone while the subregion extends along the northern bank of the Rio
Grande encompassing much or all of Starr, Zapata, Jim Hogg, Webb, Dimmit and Maverick Counties.
Overall, the South Texas Plains region is one of the most poorly known in Texas and the Rio Grande
plain itself is one of the least well known of the subregions. Very few sites have been excavated in this
region.
The earliest synthesis of the South Texas region's archaeology was attempted by E. B. Sayles
(1935) who defined several cultural complexes along the Texas coast, indicating the presence of extensive
campsites inland. Later, J. Charles Kelley (1947) defined the Monte aspect in this region and Richard
MacNeish (1947, 1958), included some parts of Texas along the lower Rio Grande in his archaeological
survey of Tamaulipas, defining the Brownsville, Abasolo, and Repelo cultural complexes. Suhm et al.
(1954) summarized the archaeology of this region, incorporating newly collected data from the Falcon
Reservoir survey and excavations (Krieger and Hughes 1950; Hartle and Stephenson 1951; Cason 1952; .
Jelks 1952, 1953). Two new foci were defined. The Falcon focus represented the Archaic of the region,
while the Mier focus, with smaller dart points and arrow points, was considered later in time. The Archaic
cultures of the southwestern Central Texas area were also addressed by Johnson (1967). Since that time a
number of important contributions have been made to the understanding of the archaeology of the south
Texas region, including papers by T. R. Hester and his colleagues (Hester 1975, 1976, 1978, 1980; 1981,
1983, 1989, 1995; Hester and Hill 1975; Hester and Eaton 1983; Hester et al. 1989).
The prehistoric cultures of South Texas and its sub-areas have been most recently synthesized by
Hester (Hester 1989, 1995) and Black (1989); the following brief summary draws most heavily from
those sources. The cultural stages are: Paleoindian (9200-6000 B.C.); Early Archaic (6000-2500 B.C.);
Middle Archaic (2500-400 B.C.); Late Archaic 400 B.C.-A.D. 800); and Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800-A.D.
1600) (Black 1989:48-51).
The earliest evidence of the human presence in South Texas dates to the Paleoindian stage. This
stage originally included the earliest inhabitants of the New World who spread across the American
continent in the waning years of the Pleistocene era. Recent possible pre-Clovis finds in both North and
South America, such as the site of Monte Verde in southern Chile (Dillehay 1989), may significantly
refine the chronology of New World occupation but the finds are still sporadic and not universally
accepted. In any case, the evidence for such early cultures has not been forthcoming in Texas.
Paleoindian cultures are typically identified by their distinctive lithic technology, including wellmade projectile points such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview and a wide range ofrelated lanceolate forms, as
well as more specialized tools such as the Clear Fork biface. Throughout the South Texas Plains area, most
of these artifacts are scattered surface finds rather than from buried stratified sites; the only excavated
Paleoindian sites are from the extreme northeastern margin of the culture area along the coastal plain
(Brown 1987; Sellards 1940). Data from the broader area of South, Southwest, and Central Texas indicates
that primary site types of this period include open sites and rockshelters, with evidence of general
occupation as well as specialized activities such as stone tool making, hunting and game processing.
Stone artifact caches and human burials have also been found which date to the Paleoindian era. In the
past, the Paleoindian peoples have been typically characterized as a nomadic big-game hunting culture,
but considerable evidence from sites in nearby regions such as Baker Cave suggests a much broader range
of subsistence activities within a rich and complex cultural tradition (Hester 1983).

Overall, the Paleoindian era is one that is marked by a gradual warming trend at the close of the
final Pleistocene Wisconsonian glaciation. This warming trend is associated with a dramatically shifting
faunal and floral environment, to which the various cultural traditions quickly adapted. The transition
from Paleoindian to the Early Archaic is difficult to define, yet by the Archaic there apparently was a
change in projectile points from lanceolate forms to stemmed points as well as unifacial Clear Fork tools
with beveled distal ends. This probably correlates with a change in subsistence patterns to a more varied
economy that no longer had an emphasis on the megafauna extinct by Archaic times. However, beyond a
very few excavated sites.(Scott and Fox 1982) subsistence data are scarce for this area. Early Archaic sites
are known throughout the area, though few have been excavated and there is very little data on such sites in
the Rio Grande Plain subregion (Black 1989:49). Throughout the general area, sites are found on high
terraces and in the uplands, but several buried alluvial sites have also been identified, though not in the
immediate project area. As with the Paleoindian period, the widespread distribution of artifact types and low
site counts suggests small populations, small band sizes, and large territorial ranges, though as Story (1985)
and Black (1989) among others have argued, these generalizations probably apply to a wide area of the
West Gulf Coastal Plain.
Despite its later date, the Middle Archaic of the South Texas Plains is little better known that its
Early Archaic and Paleoindian antecedents. Hampered by the paucity of excavated sites and the near
absence of radiocarbon dates, some of what is known is inferred by comparisons with adjacent regions
(Black 1989:49-51). By the Middle Archaic, ground stone, including manos and metates, occurs at a
number of sites, perhaps indicating a greater reliance on plant materials than during previous stages as
well as new methods of food processing. Unifacial, distally-beveled tools also continue, while triangular
dart points characterize the projectile points of this stage. Stemmed points are also present (Hester
1995:438). Sites have been identified in the uplands as well as alluvial settings and along estuary bays in
the Coastal Bend. Chronologically diagnostic artifact scatters appear for the first time in the Rio Grande
delta (Black 1989:49). In Starr County, Nunley and Hester (1975:13) identified Middle and Late Archaic
sites as occurring on terraces, arroyo banks and in hilly areas overlooking the arroyos and their tributaries.
Hall et al. (1986) suggest a greater reliance on plant materials based on the presence of burned rock
concentrations. Also at this time (2500 B.C.), the stabilization of the modem sea level led to maritime
exploitation along the coastal areas (Prewitt et al. 1987). Population densities may have increased during
this stage along with more defined territories, suggested by the presence of cemeteries at sites like Loma
Sandia in Live Oak County and Morhiss in Victoria County.
Late Archaic sites in South Texas are quite numerous and this period is considerably better
known that its predecessors. During this time, plant and marine resources probably took on a greater role
than hunting of large mammals. In fact, resource specialization may have reached a peak during this
period, followed by a somewhat more generalized subsistence in the subsequent Late Prehistoric period
(Black 1989:51). A further increase in population is inferred by the increase in site density during this
period. Regional distinctions in artifact assemblages and other cultural traits also become prominent at
this time.
The final prehistoric stage, the Late Prehistoric, is well represented in South Texas. This period is
marked by the introduction of new technologies, including the bow and arrow and ceramics, as well as
potentially new adaptive strategies (Hester 1995). Site types are varied including open campsites, lithic
scatters, and cemeteries. At the southernmost tip of the culture area, the Brownsville complex is noted for
its shell-working industry and influences from groups along the Mexican coast. Two subperiods that have
been defined for this period in Central Texas also have relevance to the Late Prehistoric of the South
Texas Plains. The earliest part of this period, the Austin subperiod, beginning about 1200 to 1300 BP,
reflects a certain degree of cultural and economic continuity underlying the adoption of new technologies
while the later Toyah subperiod, extending roughly to the beginning of the historic era, may indicate the
introduction of immigrants following a southward extension of the range of the bison. Throughout most of

the state, there is a shift back to hunting as evidenced by the faunal remains that occur during the Late
Prehistoric stage (but particularly during the Toyah subperiod).
Little is known of the fate of the prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas during the historic era.
Though a number of small groups have been documented in the early historic period of south, south
central and coastal Texas, most disappeared very quickly from the written records. In South Texas,
Campbell (1988) and Salinas (1990) have documented the available evidence on the numerous Native
American bands that roamed this region in the early historic period. With increasing Anglo settlement of
the South Texas area in the early to mid nineteenth century, and antagonistic official policies, as well as
continuous onslaughts of epidemic diseases, Native American populations began to dwindle. While the
Comanche and a few other groups were able to maintain some social cohesion, other groups were
eliminated or lost their individual identities as the survivors merged with isolated survivors from other
bands. Remnants of bands from the Plains and from across the continent, including Kickapoo, Seminole,
and others, ranged across northern Mexico and southern Texas seeking refuge from Anglo settlement and
military inclusions.
IDSTORIC PERIOD EXPLORATION AND SETTLEMENT

The earliest European presence in the general area may have been Alvar Nufiez Cabeza de Vaca
who likely passed near Maverick County on his journey westward from the Texas coast where he had
been marooned after the shipwreck of the Narvaez expedition. Later, the earliest Spanish entradas into
central and East Texas passed through the county, including the Bosque-Larios expedition of 1675, the
De Leon expedition of 1689, the Teran expedition of 1691. Most of these expeditions crossed well south
of modem day Eagle Pass, at the ford where, by 1700, the Spanish had established the mission and
settlement at Guerrero. Much of the travel from northern Mexico into Central Texas was by way of this
. route, including General Santa Ana's attempt to quell the Texas rebellion in 1836.
In a later attempt to surprise the Texans and recapture the young republic, General Woll crossed
the Rio Grande north of the old Guerrero crossing to attack San Antonio in 1842. He followed a
smuggler's trail, crossing at the Paso de los Adjuntos near the mouth of the Rio Escondido, just south of
present day Eagle Pass. Later that same year, General Isidro Reyes sent troops to the same crossing
fearing a counterattack after Woll' s attempt was repulsed.
In 1848, Captain John A. Veatch with a company of Texas Mounted Volunteer Militia, camped
on the U.S. side of the river at the old Adjuntos ford. Confusing this location with a crossing farther up
the Rio Escondido, Veatch referred to the location as Eagle Pass or Paso del Aguila, a name which came
to refer to the settlement which sprang up in this location where San Antonio merchant James Campbell
established a trading post in 1849 (Pingenot 1971:3).
Jane Cazneau, writing under the pen name Cora Montgomery, described her experiences living in
Eagle Pass between 1850 and 1852. It is one of the earliest accounts of Campbell's Store and the newly
settled community (Montgomery 1966). Montgomery also mentions that this area across the mouth of the
Rio Escondido was more preferable for orchards and gardens than the soils around the Fort where she and
her husband, General Cazneau were first established. Apparently, gardening was not the only attraction;
this locale was also favorable to smugglers because of the fords and was in closer vicinity to towns on the
Mexican side of the Rio Grande and the mining districts beyond them (Montgomery 1966:66). Under a
heading titled Social Distinctions, Cazneau describes the little settlement.
Our town was begun. It held a commodious double tent, with the first settler and
proprietor, Mr. C, and his lady, that was the aristocratic party. Then our reed shelter and
its twain. We were the democratic middle class, and close upon us was the thatched shed
of Don Guillermo the mason, in blood, bone and sinew, pure Indian; he constituted the

radical native American party. Finally there was a score of men quarrying out stone and
making adobes; some of these were free-born toilers, the working class. Below this still
another rank, enduring all the ills and blight of slavery, but with none to sorrow, none to
pray with them, for there is no political capital, no religious fame to be made out of the
Mexican peon (Montgomery 1966:94-95).
In March of 1849, Captain Sidney Burbank and Companies A, B, and F of the First U.S. Infantry
camped at a site two miles upstream of the fledgling town. First known as the Camp at Eagle Pass, the
name was quickly changed to Fort Duncan after Colonel James Duncan, a Mexican war hero. With a
steady stream of immigrants arriving at the ford, headed to California to join the gold rush, a second small
settlement called California Camp sprung up outside the fort. In 1850, John Twohig, who owned land up
and down the river on the American side, laid out a town that he also called Eagle Pass just north of the
fort. In that same year, the Mexicans established a garrison on the opposite bank. Around this military
outpost, civilian settlement quickly grew into the town of Piedras Negras, named for the coal deposits
visible along the river in this area.
The new town of Eagle Pass on the north side of Fort Duncan soon eclipsed the older settlement
at the Adjuntos ford across the mouth of the Rio Escondido. By 1851 there was stage service to San
Antonio, passing through Fort Inge where the road from Eagle Pass joined the San Antonio to San Diego
road. Life in the early settlement was not always easy. The 80 to 100 residents in 1853 lived in "eight or
ten tolerably good buildings and the same number of mud hovels" (Freeman 1853 in Crimmins 1949).
Indian attacks were a constant danger and outlaws and other assorted troublemakers sought the safety of
the border. In 1855, an American party pursuing Indian raiders clashed with Mexican troops and
eventually looted and burned the town of Piedras Negras (Pingenot 1971:5). In May of 1859, the fort was
ordered closed, but continued problems forced the army to reopen it a year later in August of 1860.
In March of 1861, Federal troops evacuated Fort Duncan. During the Civil War, Confederate
forces occupied the fort which became known as Rio Grande Station. Col. George H. Giddings
commanded its garrison. General Joseph Shelby occupied the fort for a brief period at the close of the
war, burying the last Confederate flag in the Rio Grande as he and his troops marched south into Mexico.
The town of Eagle Pass had become important as a port of trade with Mexico during the Civil War. After
the Civil War, Fort Duncan was re-established in 1868 and Maverick County was formally organized in
1871 with a population of 1,951.
By 1875 the telegraph had reached Eagle Pass. That same year the army finally purchased the
land on which Fort Duncan was located from John Twohig. A few years later, in 1882, the Texas and
New Orleans Railroad opened its lines. Shortly thereafter, the railroad bridge connecting Eagle Pass and
Piedras Negras was built. Koch's 1887 bird's eye view of the town shows the railroad bridge in
essentially the same place as today. Though life may have been somewhat easier on the post-Civil War
frontier, problems still abounded. Indian raids were not uncommon, as was trouble with outlaws. In 1876,
General John Bullis crossed the Rio Grande to attack the Lipan village at Saragosa, Mexico, after a raid
led by Chief Washo Labo killed a dozen Texans above Eagle Pass. Retreating to Texas, Bullis and his
men narrowly escaped a major international incident with the pursuing Mexican Army. King Fisher,
rancher and outlaw, was a conspicuous figure in the 1870s in Eagle Pass where he owned a saloon.
Arrested by Captain McNelly and the Texas Rangers, Fisher was never convicted on any of the charges
leveled against him. He was killed with the notorious Ben Thompson of Austin in San Antonio in 1884.
Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the town grew slowly. By 1903, the
town's population was 2,729 and by 1915, 4,000 people lived there. The 1880s saw the development of
the area's first coal mine by F. H. Hartz. Larger scale operations began in the early 1890s. By 1905, the
largest mine was producing 500 tons of coal a day for the Southern Pacific Railway Company (Pingenot

1971:9-10). By the early twentieth century, irrigated lands were being opened to agriculture (Webb
1952:II: 161).
PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

As noted in the cultural setting section, the South Texas Plains and Lower Rio Grande corridor
has seen relatively little archaeological research through the years. With less than 300 archaeological sites
recorded, Maverick County has seen a moderate amount of past archaeological investigations, which have
consisted primarily of cultural resource management surveys whose primary emphasis is locating and
documenting sites as part of the process of complying with applicable state and federal historic
preservation legislations. Much of this research has been undertaken in the general vicinity of Eagle Pass
and most of it within the past decade as intense urban growth has brought about rapid changes in the area.
Much of the earliest knowledge of the general area came from archaeological investigations in
adjacent areas of Texas (Krieger and Hughes 1950; Hartle and Stephenson 1951; Cason 1952; Jelks 1952,
1953; Johnson 1967) and Mexico (MacNeish 1947, 1958). Other than historical investigations at Fort
Duncan and a brief archaeological investigation of Campbell's Store (Notes on file at Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, the University of Texas at Austin), archaeological investigations in
Maverick County did not begin until the mid-1970s. Among the earliest cultural resource management
(CRM) investigations conducted in the Eagle Pass area were those for water and wastewater projects,
including a number of studies in the alluvial settings along the Rio Grande such as those by Whitsett
(1976) and Fox and Whitsett (1979). One of the sites recorded upstream of Eagle Pass by Whitsett (1976)
was later tested by Frkuska et al. (1977). More recently, a survey by Hubbard and Fox (1990) recorded
nine prehistoric archaeological sites (one also an ·historic mining town) in areas scheduled for various
wastewater improvements near Eagle Pass. Two of these sites were subsequently tested by O'Neill
(1991). Another of the sites recorded during this phase, 41MV104, was later investigated by trenching
(Davis and Jones 1993a).
Some of the more important archaeological investigations of the floodplain and Rio Grande
terrace areas were conducted during the past decade as part of the new International Bridge. Potter (1990)
found no sites in the area. The investigations included both surface reconnaissance and backhoe trenches
and "scrapes," both designed to search for buried material. Later geomorphic investigations were
undertaken in conjunction with the planned bridge by Collins (1991). In fact, he discounts the lower
terraces altogether, dismissing them as recent or highly disturbed, focusing instead on the upper terrace
surface which he suggests is Late Holocene in age and a likely location for buried archaeological sites.
Following recent research on Texas paleoenvironmental and geomorphological history, Collins notes that,
like many rivers in Texas, the Rio Grande appears to have been incising since about AD 1000, gradually
ceasing the deposition of sediments on the higher terrace.
Davis and Jones (1993b) conducted an archaeological survey where the international bridge and
its main access routes are located. In addition to standard surface survey and shovel tests, their
investigations also included backhoe trenching and a thorough geomorphic assessment of the general area
that was completed by Caran (1993). Caran's geomorphic assessment of the International Bridge area is
generally similar to Collins (1991), noting the lower and middle terraces are recent, and assigning the
upper terrace to the Late Holocene period. Although he did not collect new radiocarbon samples, he cites
nearby dates on this terrace ranging from 4000 to 5000 years BP (Caran 1993). More recent investigations
include the study of an apparent bone bed in vicinity of the new customs house (Brown and Anthony
1998). The bone was that of a horse, but that and the other historic materials found were likely the result
of flood deposits rather than any human activity.

Although there have been relatively few extensive archaeological investigations in the Eagle Pass
area, there have been a number of small to medium sized CRM projects. Most of these have been
restricted to high terrace and upland areas of Maverick County. In addition to the bridge and wastewater
studies cited above, archaeological investigations have been generated by coal mining in the area, such as
surveys by Espey, Huston & Associates (1981), Uecker (1994), Uecker and Warren (1995), surveys for
municipal projects (Brown 1979; Gross and Nickels 1994; Treece and Jones 1995; Nickels et al. 1999;
Karbula et al. 1999), public housing projects (Turpin 1994; Ringstaff et al. 2000), and Federal projects
along the border (Owens et al. 1998; Kibler 2001; Greaves 2001). A number of transportation route
surveys have also been conducted, including surveys (SHPDT 1985;TxDOT 1995, 1996) and a major
investigation at the Late Archaic site 41MV120 (Vierra 1998). Gustavson and Collins (1998) completed a
geoarchaeological study of the Rio Grande. Though focused primarily on areas to the south, the study of
the Holocene and Late Pleistocene alluvial history of the river is critical for understanding the potential
for buried sites in the Eagle Pass area. Two investigations completed for the Eagle Pass International
Pipeline included searching for the location of Campbell's Store along the Rio Grande, 41MV1, trenching
at sites 41MV106 and 41MV281, both in close proximity to the current project area, and a survey that
recorded new sites 41MV284-286 in the uplands northwest of FM 1021 (Anthony and Brown 2002,
2003).
The initial surveys for the current project were undertaken by the Texas Water Development
Board. A reconnaissance by Fox (2001) for the proposed East Central Wastewater Interceptor, part of the
Eagle Pass Regional Water and Sewer Project, resulted in the recording of 41MV281 along the southeast
flowing drainage west of the current right-of-way along FM 1021 and 41MV280 which lies within the
right-of-way at the northern end of the current project area. The following year, a supplemental survey
was conducted for changes to the plan (Fox 2002).
Archaeological survey for the proposed Eagle Pass Outer Loop, conducted by SWCA for
TXDOT, re-examined portions of 41MV280 as the proposed roadway passes along the edge of this large
site (Carpenter 2004). SWCA also conducted test excavations at 41MV297, an upland site which lies
several kilometers southeast to this area (Carpenter and Lawrence 2003).

PROJECT METHODS

Archaeologists from Blanton and Associates, Inc. performed an archaeological background
literature and records review prior to field investigations in order to determine the extent of previous
research in the area as well as to not the locations of previously recorded archaeological sites on or near
the water system improvement right of way. The background review involved an examination of records
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the THC. The 1936 Maverick County
Highway Map was also examined prior to the survey. No historic sites were identified during the current
project.
The archaeological investigations of the proposed wastewater right-of-way consisted of a 100
percent pedestrian survey of the four segments, augmented by shovel tests where appropriate. Surface
visibility was overall very good in each of the four segments and archaeologists covering the areas were
able to view cultural material on the ground surface where it was present. High probability areas were
located in areas along the west side of FM 1021 where the right-of-way crosses five small drainages as
well as in the northern segment, near Elm Creek.
Shovel tests were not considered necessary along the segment east of FM 1021 and ending at the
Chula Vista water tower site. The latter area is on a hill with no soil depth. In this area and moving
westward, surface exposure of gravels revealed only a few isolated pieces of chert debitage. Where the
line turns back toward FM 1021, shovel tests were not excavated because the existing right-of-way is
already very disturbed along the roadway. Shovel tests were excavated on either side of the drainages
along the FM 1021 route. Also, when cultural material was observed on the ground surface, shovel tests
were excavated to define the extent of the material and the depth of subsurface deposits. Where the rightof-way turns southwest it includes an area that was previously trenched by Anthony and Brown (2002)
with no recovery of cultural materials. The rest of the right-of-way follows a large irrigation canal and
runs along the existing roads of a neighborhood.
The central segment was also extremely disturbed due to recent development. The western
portion was devoid of any vegetation so surface visibility was excellent. The eastern portion of this
segment was directly behind a housing development and large piles of earth were in the right-of-way.
Because of these disturbances, shovel testing was not conducted. The north central segment of the project
area is all developed residential neighborhoods, covered with pavement, and shovel tests were not
possible. There was no indication of historic properties here. Along Elm Creek in the northern segment of
the project area, upland terrace remnants were considered to be high probability areas. In this area,
surface visibility was overall very good. Because site 41MV280 is located on a hill and slopes, with
exposed bedrock and gravels, shovel tests were not attempted. Shovel testing was conducted at the newly
recorded site, 41MV298 because of the soil depth there.
A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated at specific localities across the four segments ofrightof-way that comprise the project area. Shovel tests were excavated at previously recorded archaeological
sites 41MV102 located in the project area, as well as a newly discovered site (41MV298) to help
determine site boundaries and the presence, absence, and extent of subsurface deposits. All shovel tests
were excavated to the depth permitted by the hard packed clays. The results of individual shovel tests
were recorded and a hand held global positioning receiver obtained coordinates for each shovel test. No
cultural material was encountered in any of the tests nor were any of the surface artifacts collected for
curation.
One new prehistoric site was recorded and two previously recorded sites were revisited. The sites
were mapped using a GPS, and pace and compass. Initial and revisited site forms were filled out for each
and entered into the TexSite program.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

As was mentioned previously, the project area was divided into four linear segments, each
consisting of portions of new and existing right-of-way. During the current survey, one new prehistoric
archaeological site, designated 41MV298, was recorded and two updated site forms were completed for
previously recorded sites 41MV102 and 41MV280. Site 41MV298 consists of four burned rock features.
41MV102 consists of a diffuse lithic scatter along an intermittent, unnamed drainage. Site 41MV280 is a
lithic procurement and reduction area on a hill above Elm Creek. No historic sites were identified in the
project area.
PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
Southeastern Segment

fu the southeastern portion of the project area, the right-of-way follows close to existing road
easements for most of the segment. The right-of-way leaves the Chula Vista water tower pad and extends
to the northwest along a series of neighborhood roads before turning southwest and heading to FM 1021.
It follows FM 1021 in a northwesterly direction. Just north of a series of industrial businesses, the rightof-way turns west and runs parallel to an existing Eagle Pass futernational Gas Pipeline right-of-way
across some fields and to the right-of-way of a large north-south running irrigation ditch. The right-ofway follows the easement for the ditch then turns southwest at Memo Robinson Road and finally turns
northwest running parallel with the north-south running road that connects this portion of the
neighborhood with Memo Robinson Road and FM 1021.
Overall, this segment of the water system improvements extends some 6.0 kilometers before
terminating at a road intersection located to the northwest of Memo Robinson Road and east of both FM
1021 and the Maverick County canal. The pipeline route for the most part follows existing right-of-way
and crosses rolling uplands and a mosaic of open fields and suburban homes, large warehouses and farm
and industrial structures. The majority of the right-of-way is covered in prickly pear, mesquite,
blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), and buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) as well as pavement and gravels.
Surface visibility was excellent, and gravels and lightly cemented sandstone bedrock erode from the
upland slopes in many places. However, nearly all of the existing right-of-way and portions of the new
right-of-way located to the west of FM 1021 has been severely disturbed by drainage or irrigation
improvements, road construction, and clearing, burning, and chaining activities in the more rural areas as
well as urban development.
It must be noted that a new portion of the right-of-way in this segment crosses several drainages

adjacent to and west of FM 1021. These are short, intermittent tributaries of the Rio Grande and, relative
to the segments included in this project, are medium probability with respect to the presence of cultural
resources. fudeed, one previously recorded site, 41MV102, was recorded in this area. And although it was
documented on the USGS 7.5' quads located at TARL, there was no form found for the site.
The right-of-way continues northwest along FM 1021 across several other small drainages and
turns southwest, running parallel to a gas pipeline right-of-way. It crosses a small drainage that has been
completely disturbed. When the right-of-way reaches the neighborhood south of Memo Robinson Road,
the right-of-way turns to the north, running along a large irrigation canal right-of-way (Figure 2). These
areas have been impacted by road and house construction, as well as by the placement of the irrigation
canal. fu general, the area is heavily disturbed and the right-of-way exhibited no cultural resources across
the remainder of the segment.

Central Segment

The central segment of the
project area is located to the north of
the City of Eagle Pass. The segment
is approximately 1.5 kilometers in
length and connects a large water
tower located some 1.0 kilometers
southeast of the intersection of US
277 and Business 277, north of
Eagle Pass to the water distribution
system. The right-of-way runs from
the water tower tank to the west
along the fenceline of a new
development of single family
homes. The right-of-way crosses a
small drainage and continues west
upslope to an area that has been
used as a dump for fill materials.
This is an area of thick vegetation,
including
mesquite,
guayacan
(Guaiacum
angustifolium),
blackbrush and other species.
Sandstone bedrock erodes out of the
sides of the small drainage.
Figure 2. Irrigation canal along right-of-way just south of
Memo Robinson Road; view to north
The right-of-way then crosses a new road and runs west along the north fenceline of a school to
the railroad tracks, where it ends (Figure 3). To the north of the road, it appears that the entire area has
been cleared and burned. There are gravels and cobbles of siliceous material visible across the ground
surface, but no indication of cultural material was apparent. Moreover, fill has been dumped in this
location as well, intermixing with the gravels eroding out of the hillslope. Overall, the soils in the area are
very thin except in the area where piles of fill have been dumped. No cultural resources were documented
along this segment of the right-of-way.
North Central Segment

The north central segment of the project area is located approximately 1.25 kilometers north of
the intersection of US 277 and Business 277 in the Seco Mines area north of Eagle Pass. This short
segment is all located in existing right-of-way along Church Street, Valerie Street, and Diaz Street,
respectively (Figure 4). The right-of-way originates at a water tower location on the west side of U.S. 277
north. The entire area is a developed neighborhood of single family homes. The water line is going to be
placed beneath the existing street and will impact no new areas.

Northern Segment

The northern segment of the project is located in the Deer Run area, a mixed suburban and rural
area located in proximity to Elm Creek. The right-of-way runs along the easement of a gravel road
winding north and then to the northwest before turning north again running parallel with Elm Creek for a
short distance. The segment runs parallel to a fenceline, approximately 200 meters southeast of Elm
Creek and 100 meters to the northwest of the Maverick County Canal. This area is an upland environment
with vegetation consisting primarily of mesquite with more succulent plant species in proximity to a small
tributary of Elm Creek. Surface visibility was excellent and little artifactual material was noted except for
a few isolated pieces of chert including three modified flakes and a split cobble. The right-of-way then
turns to the east-southeast and runs across the tributary and in close proximity to the beginning of the
irrigation canal. At this point, the landscape opens up into clear range land. The right-of-way merges with
an existing right-of-way for the Eagle Pass Outer Loop. The right-of-way proceeds across the lower slope
and saddle between two hills that are covered with gravels and cultural material, previously recorded as
41MV280 and revisited and described by the project team. This area is underlain by the Olmos
Formation, but the hills are the only outcrops of Uvalde gravels mapped in the area.
Thus, the right-of-way extends to the southeast along the proposed Eagle Pass Outer Loop over
open range land that has been highly disturbed by clearing, chaining, and possibly brush burning. Sparse
vegetation includes mesquite, blackbrush, and a number of grasses. The right-of-way runs parallel with
the Maverick County Canal located some 100 meters to the west. As the right-of-way runs closer to the
irrigation canal, upland soils were highly eroded and several burned rock clusters were observed on the
ground surface. These clusters were recorded as 41MV298.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
Site 41MV102

Site 41MV102 is a previously recorded site just west of FM 1021 that was mapped along a
northeast-southwest running field road north of a small drainage. As there was no existing site form at
TARL, it is not known what type of site was originally mapped or even whether it was prehistoric or
historic. Presently, a few surface artifacts suggest a diffuse lithic scatter. As currently mapped, the site
extends from north of the field road down the slope southeast to the small drainage and a short distance
beyond (Figure 5). It measures approximately 385 meters northwest-southeast by 215 meters at its widest
point and lies at an elevation of about 715 feet AMSL. The small drainage runs southwest into a larger
tributary flowing south to the Rio Grande (Figure 6). This was one of the few drainages along this portion
of the project area that had not been channelized.
The ground was bare for the most part providing excellent surface visibility. The vegetation is
mesquite woodland with sparse grasses. The site area has been severely disturbed by erosion, construction
of FM 1021, an irrigation canal that parallels the west side of FM 1021 in this area (Figure 7), and the
field road. Moreover, the area has been burned, chained and cleared.
There were no artifact concentrations visible on the surface in this or any part of the site that was
previously documented. To the south of the drainage, several artifacts were visible on the ground surface,
including a couple of pieces of burned sandstone and one modified flake. The flake was a primary
decortication flake with two notches along one margin. It appeared that the flake may have been utilized
as a spokeshave. The backfill from the irrigation ditch exposed siliceous gravels, sandstone and a few
pieces of chert. A single biface fragment was observed in the backfill some 25 meters to the northeast of
Shovel Test 6. No other artifacts were observed in this area.

Six shovel tests were excavated in the area of site 41MV102. The shovel tests revealed no
subsurface cultural deposits (Table 1). Soils at the site are mapped as Capita sandy clay loam, 1 to 3
percent slopes (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). This gently sloping soil exhibits slopes that are mainly
convex. The surface layer is approximately 12 inches of friable sandy clay loam that is light brownish
gray in the upper part and grayish brown in the lower part. The next layer is 25 inches of very pale brown,
friable sandy clay loam with some limy masses throughout. The underlying material is yellowish, weakly
cemented sandstone (Stevens and Arriaga 1977:9). Overall, the shovel test profiles adhered closely with
the profiles described in the USDA Soil Survey of Maverick County (Steven and Arriaga 1977:7-9). The
shovel tests yielded no subsurface cultural materials either north or south of the drainage. Because the site
is in poor condition, and consists of only a few lithic artifacts with no identifiable features or buried
components, it is not considered eligible for the NRHP, or worthy of formal designation as a SAL. No
further archaeological work is recommended for this site.

Site 41MV280

This lithic procurement area, on a prominent hill above Elm Creek, was previously recorded by
TWDB in 2001 as part of proposed water improvements for the City of Eagle Pass Regional Water and
Sewer Project (Fox 2001). The site was mapped as covering the whole hill and lower slopes extending
down to the 800-foot contour interval. Ground cover was essentially what it is today-gravelly surface with
low scattered scrub. Artifacts recorded consisted of tested cobbles, primary and secondary flakes and a
few cores. No diagnostic artifacts or features were observed. During 2003, as part of the survey for the
proposed TxDOT Eagle Pass Outer Loop, the site was reexamined by SWCA (Carpenter 2004). The site
description is essentially the same as that noted by Fox (2001) in the original site form; tested cobbles and
debitage reflecting early lithic reduction. No diagnostics or features were identified in the six trenches dug
within the TxDOT right-of-way.
As part of the current project the site was revisited because the proposed City of Eagle Pass
Water System Improvement project right-of-way also crosses the lower slope and saddle portion of the
site. In addition, the current right-of-way extends from this line northeastward to the top of the adjoining
hill where one of the water towers is to be located. The site boundaries were drawn to include this latter
section of the right-of-way to a point half way up the adjoining hill or where debitage was still observed.
Debitage was not noted on this hill top. At this point, the site now measures roughly 400 meters
southwest-northeast by 250 meters northwest-southeast at elevations ranging from 790 to 850 feet above
mean sea level (Figure 8). Elm Creek is located 600 meters to the north-northwest. There is also a small
side drainage about 450 meters to the southeast that originates from the southern end of the saddle and
drains the two hills.

The surface is still bare with sandstone bedrock and eroded chert gravels that provided the
material for tool making (Figure 9). There are small clumps of grasses, scattered mesquite, blackbrush,
tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), guayacan, prickly pear and allthorn (Caste/a texana). Soils are mapped as
Jimenez association rolling (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). These soils are loamy-skeletal, mixed, active,
hyperthermic, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls (NRCS 2004). These ancient soils are shallow, calcareous
and contain quartzite, chert, limestone and basalt pebbles. The underlying sediments are mapped as upper
Cretaceous Olmos Formation which consists of clays and sandstones along with isolated remnants of
Pleistocene Uvalde gravels containing chert, quartz and some igneous rock (Barnes 1976). Disturbances
to the site include erosion, plant growth, and the current transmission line.

Figure 9. Gravels at 41MV280

As with the two previous investigations at the site, no features were identified during the current
survey. However, isolated pieces of burned rock were noted, mostly gray fractured stone but some red
cobbles were also observed. Raw lithic material consists of chert cobbles, a few tabular in form. The chert
is fairly siliceous but some specimens are coarser. Tested cobbles dominate the assemblage that also
includes cores, large secondary and tertiary flakes, 6 centimeters or more in size, some edge-worked
flakes, a thick, early stage biface with an overshot fracture of brown, siliceous chert and tan cortex. A
lithic reduction sequence of five pieces of heat-treated chert of the same material, including a biface
fragment and secondary and tertiary flakes, was found on the lower slope of the hill to the northeast.
These artifacts and other heat-treated ones suggest the heating took place at site. Therefore, some burned
rock should be present and that observed may be remnants from this process. Because of the shallow soils

ADDITIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY FOR CITY OF EAGLE PASS WATER WORKS SYSTEM

22

and gravelly surface on the hill slope and saddle, shovel tests were not dug. No artifacts were collected
during the surface inspection.
This site was a lithic procurement and initial reduction site located on the hill and slopes below
and continuing across the saddle to the lower slopes of the opposite hill. The Uvalde gravels exposed
provided the source of quality chert as well as other siliceous stones. Though the site is extensive, no
features were observed. Due to the shallow nature of the soils, there is no possibility of intact, buried
features. Because further work beyond the testing recently conducted by SWCA is not likely to add to our
knowledge of the prehistory of the region, none is recommended. In addition, the site is not thought
eligible for nomination to the NRHP or for formal designation as a SAL.
41MV298

This site is an open campsite consisting of four disturbed burned rock clusters. It is 200 meters
east of an upper branch of a side drainage to Elm Creek which is 1.2 kilometers to the northwest. As
mapped, the site measures about 40 meters north-south by 30 meters east-west, and lies at an elevation of
785 feet above mean sea level (Figure 10). The site is on level ground with a bare gravelly surface. There
is a wide variety of stone; sandstone, limestone, quartzite, igneous types and some chert. The sparse
vegetation includes very scattered, tall mesquite, allthorn, tasajillo, guayacan, blackbrush and prickly
pear.
Soils are mapped as Copita sandy clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (Stevens and Arriaga 1977).
Copita series have recently been reclassified as fine-loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Aridic
Calciustepts (NCRS 2004). These are calcareous loamy soils that formed over sandstone. The underlying
sediments are of the Olmos Formation cited above (Barnes 1976).
Though disturbed, four rather distinct burned rock clusters were identified and mapped as part of
the site. Two of these features contain 75 to 100 pieces of stone while the other two contain only a few
specimens of burned rock. Feature 3 is located near the northwest boundary of the site some 15 meters
from the other clusters. It consists of about seven pieces of burned rock, including quartzite, sandstone,
and limestone, that are approximately 10 centimeters or more in size. It has been scattered to roughly 1 to
2 meters in diameter.
Feature 1 is located about 1.5 meters northwest of Feature 4, one of the two larger concentrations
of burned rock. The former feature consists of two large cobbles, about 15 centimeters in size, and a few
smaller fire-cracked pieces of sandstone and limestone. It is spread over an area less than 1 meter in
length and 50 centimeters in width.
Feature 2 is one of the better preserved clusters and consists of roughly 75 to 100 pieces of firecracked stone (Figure 11 ). Limestone, sandstone, quartz, some igneous specimens and chert comprise the
material types. Chert colors noted include gray and white with pink streaks indicating heat treatment. The
feature measures approximately 3 meters southwest-northeast by 2 meters north-south. While many
stones measure about 10 centimeters or more in size, most are smaller. A trowel probe into a more intact
portion of the feature failed to reveal any subsurface staining or charcoal.
Feature 4 is separated from Feature 2 by about 1.5 meters. It is also fairly intact with several
stones cracked in place. It measures about 2.5 meters in diameter and consists of limestone, sandstone,
quartzite, fire-cracked chert and igneous materials. A trowel probe into the center of this feature also
failed to identify any subsurface staining or charcoal.

Figure 11. Burned rock features at 41MV298; view to northwest

A very light lithic scatter is associated with the burned rock features and indicates a initial
reduction site. A few specimens, including chert chunks, split cobbles, a core, large tertiary and secondary
flakes, and a single early-stage thick biface were observed in addition to the chert pieces noted within the
two larger features. Thinning or smaller flakes were not observed. Some shards of modem clear bottle
glass were found near Feature 4. These were likely intended for the modem dump which is just northeast
of the site. None of the artifacts were collected.
Four shovel tests were excavated into the very compact, dark gray-brown loamy clay to a
maximum depth between 20 and 30 centimeters below the surface (Table 2). This depth was considered
sufficient due to the upland setting as well as the compacted nature of the soils. In addition, the erosional
gullies just off site to the east were also examined for signs of buried cultural materials but none were
observed. No sign of cultural materials was observed in any of the tests and only a few small gravels were
found in each. The features are currently lying on a deflated surface and while the likelihood of deeper
buried materials is possible, it is not thought very likely.

The four burned rock clusters that include fire-cracked chert, and the light artifact scatter
composed primarily of initial reduction lithic debitage, indicates a short-term camp perhaps devoted to the
heat treatment of chert. Features 2 and 4 are likely remnants of hearths. A similar site has recently been
examined by SWCA (Carpenter 2004). Site 41MV297 is located 1.7 kilometers to the southeast and

ADDITIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY FOR CITY OF EAGLE PASS WATER WORKS SYSTEM

25

consists of 5 hearths. Artifacts at 41MV297 consist of about 30 pieces including a core, flakes, a latestage biface fragment and several Archaic dart points, one of which is tentatively identified as a Langfly
which would date the occupation of the site to at least the Middle Archaic (Turner and Hester 1999:143).
Because this site is surficial and the features lack depth there is little to gain from further work.
The site is not thought to be significant. Therefore, it is not considered eligible for the NRHP or for
formal designation as a SAL.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Three prehistoric archaeological sites were located and documented during the course of the
survey for revisions to the City of Eagle Pass Waterworks Improvements. These consist of 41MV102,
located along FM 1021 and an intermittent drainage in the southeastern segment of the project area,
41MV280, located in the northern segment of the project area on a hill and saddle exhibiting chert-rich
Uvalde gravels eroding from their slopes, and 41MV298, comprised of a total of four burned rock clusters
and a light lithic scatter located some 500 meters to the southeast of 41MV280. There were no historic
sites identified on any of the four segments.
Despite the paucity of evidence for prehistoric human occupation along the four segments in the
current project area, we can draw several conclusions that reinforce what we know about where aboriginal
people were located themselves across the landscape. Site 41MV102 is a very sparse lithic scatter with
one or two pieces of burned rock located in direct proximity to a water source, the small intermittent
drainage located in the southeastern portion of the site. The proximity to water is a critical variable when
considering the location and/or potential significance of archaeological sites. Sites 41MV280 and
41MV298 are located near two resources that were critical to the aboriginal communities in the area. The
hill and the saddle where 41MV280 is located was important because of the rich diversity of gravels that
are present there. Particularly, siliceous materials or cherts were important to these communities by
providing the material for differing kinds of tools used in daily activities. The artifacts at 41MV280
suggest that aboriginal peoples were exploiting the gravels by producing large flakes that were perhaps
removed to campsites for further reduction into formal tools, or utilized as expedient tools. Site 41MV298
is located in proximity to water and relatively close to chert resources. A previously recorded site,
41MV297, is located close by, suggesting that people were visiting this area as part of the quest for food,
water, and lithic resources.
To reiterate, 41MV102 is a very diffuse lithic scatter located on an ancient alluvial terrace of the
river which is cut by a small erosional tributary of the drainage that runs along the edge of the river
terrace just to the south of here, A total of four artifacts were observed on the ground surface across
approximately 350 meters. Soils on the site are very thin and exhibit little accumulation or depth, and the
site is highly disturbed from road and canal construction. The same can be said for the cultural resources
there. As such, the site is considered ineligible for listing on the NRHP or worthy of designation as a
SAL. Therefore, no further work is recommended.
Site 41MV280 is a lithic procurement and initial reduction site located on a hill and saddle and
slopes below. The Uvalde gravels exposed provided the source of quality chert as well as other siliceous
stones. Though the site is extensive, no features were observed. Because of the shallow nature of the hill
and soils, there is no possibility of intact, buried features. Because further work beyond the testing
recently conducted by SWCA is not likely to add to our knowledge of the prehistory of the region, none is
recommended. In addition, the site is not thought eligible for nomination to the NRHP or worthy of
designation as a SAL.
The four burned rock clusters at 41MV298 that included fire-cracked chert, and a diffuse lithic
scatter composed primarily of initial reduction lithic debitage indicates a short-term camp perhaps
devoted to the heat treatment of chert. Because this site is surficial and the features lack depth there is
little to gain from further work. The site is not thought to be significant. Therefore, it is not considered
eligible for the NRHP or worthy of designation as a SAL.
However, in the event that previously unidentified cultural resources are encountered during
construction, work in the area should be halted until the Texas Historical Commission can be consulted
and the deposits assessed.
