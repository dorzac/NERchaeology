ABSTRACT

The log cabin known as 41NV386 was recorded by David Jurney in 1981
in conjunction with the Richland Archaeological Project. It was rerecorded
in 2006 during an archaeological survey of The Shores at
Richland/Chambers Lake and tested in 2008 to satisfy Corps of Engineers
404 permit stipulations. In 2007, 1950s pictures of the structure were
discovered in the photograph files at Pioneer Village in Corsicana. The log
structure has deteriorated significantly over the past half century but it was
tested to determine if it was originally built on its present location or if it
had been moved there later. Testing revealed an absence of mid-nineteenth
century artifacts, and along with the presence of half-dovetail notches
which were common in the 1850s, and the single tree ring date of
1832+20 years AD, it appears that the cabin is more than a century and a
half old. It was apparently moved to its present location late in the 1800s
based on the sample of late 1800s artifacts which include square-cut nails
and hand-turned purple bottle glass. A mud cat chimney was built in the
center of the western wall when the cabin was reassembled on its present
location. The cabin was occupied into the twentieth century based on the
abundance of wire nails, two piece mold bottle fragments, and other early
1900s artifacts. The present decomposed and displaced condition of the
cabin, the absence of intact features other than the chimney base, and the
mixed artifact assemblage eliminate the cabin from further consideration
for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The history and archaeology of the log cabin at The Shores was carried out thanks to the
contributions of the people mentioned below as well as many others who are not recorded
in this report. First and foremost, we want to thank Bill and Bobbie Jean Young for their
continuing interest in the history and archaeology of Navarro County. Bill serves as the
Archeological Steward for the Texas Historical Commission and has been involved in
locating and recording prehistoric and historic archaeological sites in the greater
Corsicana area. His encouragement was instrumental in seeing that archaeological
surveys were conducted in the proposed Tennessee Colony Lake area and in the
Richland/Chambers Lake area. For years he has written a weekly column about
archaeology and history in the Corsicana newspaper. He has also been the lead
investigator in the documenting of hundreds of cemeteries in Navarro County. Bobbie
Jean has been supportive of these activities throughout these years and has been Curator
of Pioneer Village in Corsicana which is sponsored by the Navarro County Historical
Society. These two folks provided information, artifact identification, photographs, and
encouragement throughout the cabin study and are thanked for all their help.
David Jurney of the US Forest Service in Arkansas recorded the cabin in 1981 and over
the past two years provided us with his memories of the cabin. He also was a source of
information about other cabin studies and tree-ring dating of cabins in Texas and in
adjacent states. Information about mud cat chimneys was also provided by Meeks
Etchison of the US Forest Service, also in Arkansas, as well as Butch Lee of Earth
Search, Inc. Don Wyckoff of the Sam Noble Museum at the University of Oklahoma also
provided information about cabins. Tree-ring dating was conducted by Dan Stahle at the
University of Arkansas in Fayetteville thanks to the training by his father, Dr. David
Stahle, Director of the Tree-Ring Laboratory at the University of Arkansas in
Fayetteville.
Joanna Roberson, a doctoral candidate at Southern Methodist University, went through
the Richland/Chambers Project records at SMU and retrieved a copy of the site survey
form prepared by David Jurney. She also found an original photograph of the log cabin at
the time of the Richland/Chambers Project which has been included in this document.
Last but not least, Missi Green of Geo-Marine, Inc. in Plano is to be thanked for her help
with the identification of artifacts found during the original survey and in conjunction
with the cabin testing.

INTRODUCTION
In the spring of 2006, AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted a cultural resources survey
at The Shores at Richland/Chambers which is an 800 acre residential development that
includes eight miles of shoreline at Richland/Chambers Lake in Navarro County, Texas
(Figure 1). The surveyed area included an upland pasture that had been a farmed field
where the previously known but unstudied location of a collapsed log cabin was recorded
(41NV386) but not tested at the time of the lake survey. The cabin was believed to date to
the mid-1800s (Jurney and Moir 1982:156) and to be the oldest intact log structure then
recorded in the county. The purpose of the present investigation was to further record the
decomposing remains of the cabin before a house is built on the lot and to determine the
age of the heavily disturbed structure. The log cabin was tested in response to permit
stipulations from the Fort Worth District office of the US Army Corps of Engineers
(COE) regarding the issuance of a 404 permit for the housing project. Based on the
results of the 2006 survey (Craver and Skinner 2006), it had been recommended that the
log cabin was not likely to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places. Environmental permitting for The Shores was coordinated by the Fort Worth
office of the engineering firm of Turner Collie and Braden, Inc.
During the initial survey a title search and review of the Navarro County tax records for
the cabin were conducted at the county courthouse by Bill Young of Corsicana who is the
Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Steward for this area. No discussion of a
specific house site or of a log cabin was found in the records. It is believed that the log
cabin was moved from its original location to its current location but the title search
found no evidence of this. According to Norman Alston (personal communication 2007),
the installation of an out building such as the cabin would have had no impact on the tax
value of the large tract and the tax records would not be expected to provide substantive
information about the presence of, the origin of, or the arrival date of the cabin.
The following report contains a brief review of the natural and cultural environment of
the area as it relates to the past one hundred and fifty years. The research design and
methodology are presented in the next section. The results chapter begins with a
summary of David Jurney’s 1981 description of the log cabin and then presents archival
photographs of the cabin believed to date to the 1950s. This is followed by a description
of the present condition of the cabin and the results of limited testing within and outside
the log pile. The last chapter presents conclusions about the site and places it into the
context of a regional perspective. This document was prepared following the report
guidelines developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (ND) and adopted by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC). The Texas Historical Commission reviewed the
report for the COE but a Texas Antiquities Permit was not required for the investigation.

HISTORIC AND NATURAL SETTING
The Shores is located in the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province and near the
boundary of the Blackland Prairie and Eastern Deciduous Forest biomes. The surface
geology of the study area is composed of the undivided Wilcox Group (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1970). This formation consists mostly of mudstones with some sands,
clays, and sandstones. Quaternary alluvium fills the valleys of Chambers and Richland
Creeks and a short distance up Long Arm Branch but is confined to the channels now
under the lake.
The soils are all included in the Crockett-Wilson association which includes fine
textured, very permeable, calcareous soils (Meade, Chervenka and Greenwade 1974). All
the soils are upland varieties. The upland north of Long Arm Branch is composed
primarily of Wilson very fine sandy loam and Wilson clay loam along with areas of
Crockett fine sandy loam.
The development site is situated near the boundary of the Austroriparian and Texan biotic
provinces. This environmental dichotomy is also reflected in the fact that the Blackland
Prairie is situated to the north of Richland Creek and the Eastern Deciduous forest is to
the south (Richner and Lee 1977:22-24). The property was farmed prior to World War II,
and was in pasture until the lake was built. In pre-1900 times, the land was probably a
tall-grass prairie. All of the drainages are mapped as being intermittent, and at the time of
the survey, water was present only in the lake and in stock tanks. There may have been a
spring at the upper end of Long Arm Branch and thus potable water may have been as
close as 1000 feet to the west or northwest. The climate in the region is generally
characterized by long growing seasons of about 260 frost free days with hot summers and
mild winters. Rainfall in this humid subtropical area averages 37 to 41 inches per year.
Rainfall is heaviest in the late spring and early summer and lightest in mid-summer.

The history of the American Era has been divided into four periods by Richner and Lee
(1977:48-50). The four periods are frontier (ca 1820-1840), initial cash crop (ca 18401870), tenant farming (ca 1870-1940), and agribusiness (ca 1940-present). The second
period was divided by the Civil War, but was characterized by the growth of cotton as a
cash crop and the use of the river for transportation. Tenant farming replaced the
plantation system after the Civil War and railroads replaced river navigation as the means
of moving cotton to the market place. Lumbering and oil production were added to the
economic base during this period. The last period (Agribusiness) is marked by the
consolidation of farms and the use of mechanized equipment to plant and harvest crops
that had been done in the past by the once large labor pool. Since the beginning of this
period, crop production has been replaced with livestock production and cotton has been
replaced by pasturage.
The Richland Archaeological Project expanded the earlier temporal framework and the
survey found no evidence of sites dated to the frontier period. This is attributed to the fact
that the floodplain flooded regularly and that early sites were situated in the upland

outside the lake area. Many farmsteads dated between 1850 and 1950 were found in the
lake area and confirmed occupation in the floodplain, edge of the upland, as well as
throughout the upland. Cotton farming was the major activity that drove occupation in the
Richland and Chambers Creeks area and with the culmination of the Civil War tenant
farmers (croppers, renters, and others) became a major rural socioeconomic constituency
in this part of the cotton belt (Moir 1987).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Site 41NV386 was considered by Jurney to be the oldest extant log cabin in Navarro
County when he recorded the site in 1981. Inspection in conjunction with archaeological
survey of The Shores at Richland/Chambers Lake led to the conclusion that the logs in
the cabin may be from the mid-1800s as believed by Jurney but that the structure may not
be in its original location and that some time prior to 1900 it was moved to this spot in
the middle of a “cleared” field to be used as a storage building or as a residence for a
tenant farmer.
The purpose of this investigation was to answer the following questions:
1.

When were the logs cut? Was it in the mid-1800s? And could they have been
harvested in this immediate area?

2.

Is this the original location of the structure or was it moved to this location and
used at this location in the early 1900s or late 1800s?

3.

What was the purpose of this structure when it was occupied/used on the property
that now is The Shores?

In order to answer these questions, we needed to do the following:
a.
Collect tree ring samples from the logs that have heartwood and as close as
possible to the outside ring of the trees. This was to have been done using an increment
borer but was done by cutting a section from one log. We also wished to determine the
types of log wood present as part of describing the structure. Cabin logs needed to be
photographed and given individual numbers in order to relate them to tree ring samples.
How long are the complete logs, ie was the structure square or rectangular?
b.
Collect tree ring samples from the hackberry tree, if possible, in order to
determine the tree’s age which may correlate with the date that the cabin was placed at
the site. It was necessary to collect diameter measurements and then come up with an
average annual growth rate thickness.
c.
Map the structure with particular attention to openings in the wall, height
reconstruction, opening location heights and widths as well as the artifact scatter and the
presence of outside features such as a cistern, root cellar, chimney, or entry side walk.
d.
Test for the presence of artifacts inside the structure as well as outside in order to
obtain datable materials from the time(s) when the structure was occupied/used. The
composition of artifacts should give us a hint at what the structure was being used for and
when. Also test for the base to a chimney, is a rock slab hearth or a heavily burned clay
hearth buried below the surface where an exterior chimney was present. This is an area
where Jordan (1978:95-99) might expect to find a burned clay hearth and not a slab base
to a chimney. This would be highly unlikely if the structure was occupied in the 1900s
since cast iron or sheet metal stoves had replaced exterior chimneys and open hearths,

particularly in a structure with a small floor space. It is unlikely that a well would be
present but numerous brick-lined cisterns are present in the early 1900s houses that were
recorded during the survey.
Brush, weeds, loose logs and other junk had to be moved from the site area and young
trees needed to be removed or branches trimmed so that testing and site photography
could be done effectively. A 1x1 m grid system was used to map the cabin and external
features along with test units.
Tree-ring samples were collected for dating and wood types were determined. Six 1x1 m
units were excavated and were located inside the structure as well as outside after the
exterior had been weed-eaten down to the ground level and the weeds blown out of the
immediate area. Excavation was in 10 cm levels. Shovel-scraping and troweling the
surface of the units did not reveal buried artifacts. All fill was screened through 1/4”
mesh hardware cloth.

RESULTS
The cabin at The Shores was first recorded by David Jurney in conjunction with the
archaeological survey of Richland/Chambers Lake (Raab 1982:156-158) and this chapter
begins by reviewing the results of the original site description. The second section of the
chapter presents a series of historic photographs found in the Pioneer Village files after
the survey at The Shores was completed. The third section presents the findings of
archaeological investigation at the site with regard to recording and dating the cabin and
assessing the contents of the midden deposit in the immediate vicinity of the cabin.
At the time of the lake survey, the cabin was situated outside the study area but its
potential importance was recognized by the SMU team and the landowner agreed to let
the survey team record the site. This was done by filling out a survey form and taking
photographs but the collection of tree ring samples for dating was not allowed despite the
demonstrated successful dating of several other structures in the lake area and in the
county (Jurney 1987:Figure 2-2).
The site is designated as SMU4439 in the survey report (Jurney and Moir 1982:Figure
13-1b) and is one of several nineteenth century log dwellings recorded by survey teams.
It was found to be situated in a broad flat field that is north of Long Arm Branch. The site
is described as consisting of a square single pen log structure with a gable-end chimney
despite the fact that no evidence other than the 1.7 m wide wall opening in the center of
the west wall was found. However, Jurney noted on the site form that handmade bricks
were present in the immediate vicinity of the west opening and apparently concluded that
a brick chimney had been present. In fact, openings are shown to be in the center of each
wall (Figure 2). The north, east, and south openings are mapped as being approximately a
meter wide and the eastern opening is noted as being a window. The bottom logs were
resting on the ground but Jurney noted the presence of crudely cut tree trunk foundation
piers. Sill logs were not recognizable. The post oak wall logs were joined with halfdovetail corner notches or corner timbering as the term is used in the report. Jurney
mentions that cedar pole rafters were present and that cypress or pine boards had been
used on the interior walls. The survey form mentions that an artifact scatter
approximately 50 m in diameter was present but does no mention or map the relationship
of the cabin to the scatter. The form notes that ground visibility was 80-90% but that the
field was then being used for raising winter wheat.
By the time of the major excavation report, the site had been designated 41NV386 and is
described as being 5.0 by 5.6 m in size and having a floor area of 25.6 square meters
(Jurney 1987:Table 2-1). This original investigation considered that the single pen
structure was probably built and initially occupied some time between 1845 and 1860
(Jurney 1987:Figure 2-2). This dating also conforms to the date for half-dovetail notching
described by Jordan (1978:81). The site was considered by Jurney to be the only in situ
1850 period structure in the impact area.

back and outside the south and north walls of the structure. A pile of trees, lumber, and
sheet metal is shown on top of or immediately adjacent to the west wall. The northwest
corner is not visible. The surrounding area was a cleared pasture which has been grazed
to ground level by cows that are shown in the middle right-hand side of the picture. At
least two long logs that apparently were from the south wall are shown inside the north
opening and one of them is notched and probably represents the door header in the
southern wall. No evidence of lumber framing within the structure is apparent and any
evidence of a chimney is covered by the pile of logs and lumber. No evidence of a roof is
obvious but Jurney (1981) indicated the presence of cedar roof beams on the site survey
form.
The SMU team had worked with Bill Young of Corsicana throughout their investigation
at Richland/Chambers Lake and we continued to work closely with Mr. Young in
conjunction with the survey at The Shores. Not long after the survey report for The
Shores was completed, Young called to report that his wife, Bobbie Jean, had found 4x5”
black and white negatives of the cabin in the files at Pioneer Village where she is the
Curator. Documentation of the pictures is limited to a notation that the cabin is from the
Bright Farm which is located about six miles southwest from the present location of the
cabin. This would indicate that the cabin was formerly on the Twin Oaks Ranch that was
owned by Pete Hamilton and was inherited by the late Liston Herod and his wife. As an
aside, a recently discovered letter dated March 25, 1850 from William Bright to his
brother describes river traffic on the Trinity River and plans for it on Richland and
Chambers creeks. This letter was found in the Pioneer Village archives. The pictures
were probably taken by Alva Taylor who was a professional photographer in Corsicana
in the 1950s and who was a founder of the Navarro County Historical Society and
Pioneer Village. Taylor was also curator of Pioneer Village. The following seven pictures
are accompanied by captions prepared after review of the present structure and Jurney’s
site information. Unfortunately, no scales are in the pictures but the logs in the present
structure range from 14 to 29 cm in height.
The following photographs (Figures 4-10) show the cabin to be a rectangular structure
that had an opening in each of the four walls. It was held together with logs that were
half-dovetail notched and had been shaped to a rectangular profile. If the average height
of the logs was 25 cm then the standing structure would have been more than eight feet
tall. No evidence of a roof or upper story is visible. The pictures are discussed in greater
detail in the captions that are presented below each figure.

having no plank facing but the logs had been cut with a saw and the height
is an estimated 4.9 feet high. The overall estimated height of the wall is
8.2 feet. The east wall connects to the right end of this façade and is up
against what appears to be a two-trunk hackberry tree [it actually is three
trunks as shown on Figure 5]. A lath is visible inside the opening and is
shown from the other direction in Figure 8. Note that the east wall appears
to have been raised up in the middle of the corner and the cause of this is
not obvious.

An almost straight on view of the east wall showing four logs above the
opening in the wall that is mostly obscured by the three-trunk hackberry

spreading noted in Figure 4 is obviously due to a log section having fallen
into the structure but it appears that at least five logs made up the wall
section between the southeast corner and the opening in the east wall.
Logs are obvious on the right side of the opening but it is not obvious how
many were present. Both corners are clearly half-dovetailed notched. An
opening is apparent in the center of the north wall which is shown on
Figure 6. This can be seen through the space created by the apparent
collapse on the north end of the east wall.

appear to be in place. The lowest of the wall logs that span the wall is
notched and defines the top of the opening. As before, there are four logs
above the opening and six logs show to be present to the right of the
opening making up the western end of the north wall. All the notching
appears to be half-dovetail. As shown on all the pictures, the logs have
been shaped to be taller than they are wide and the space to be filled
between logs was relatively narrow.

below. At least two “vertical” lathes
appear to be have been nailed to the
inside of the wall and may indicate that
the wall had been insulated after it was
rebuilt on this location. Also note two
horizontally oriented boards nailed to
cover log spaces behind the vertical
lathes. Two similar horizontal boards
are on the west wall between the
second and third logs above the ground.

It has been impossible to determine just what happened to the cabin in the quarter century
that occurred between when the photographs were taken and the time that the structure
was recorded as an archaeological site by David Jurney. Certainly the logs continued to
decompose and we do not have any idea if tree-ring dating could have been done on the
few logs present at that time. Furthermore, although sections of the logs above the
openings were preserved, it appears from the photograph that many of the logs were
missing. Consequently, it appears that logs may have been removed from the house
which may have begun to collapse or that the removal of better preserved logs may have
resulted in the collapse of the cabin. In either case, the cabin had roughly been reduced to
a pile of logs when it was recorded as an archaeological site.

The cabin area was tested during March of 2008 in order to attempt to answer the
questions presented above. The immediate site area was cleared of brush, grass, and
weeds before a grid system was imposed over the site area (Figure 11). It was noted at the
time that water was present in the clay soil immediately under the ground surface and
also that several areas had been so disturbed that testing was unwarranted. The area
immediately east of the large three-trunk hackberry tree had been used for dumping piles
of dirt along with large branches. No testing was done in this area. The area immediately

southeast had been disturbed and soil removed and standing water was present just below
the ground surface. The area to the southwest of the structure had been extensively
disturbed by hogs routing in the soil but they had not uncovered any significant artifacts

or evidence of a buried deposit. The area west of the cabin is where a large hackberry had
grown and the rotten stump, roots, and trunk were present on the ground and have been
incorporated into a dense growth of honey locust saplings is present. The entire northwest
quadrant of the cabin and the adjacent ground outside had been bulldozed and scraped to
the point that it is impossible to estimate with any confidence where the house corner had
been. Furthermore, the northeastern corner of the cabin and the adjacent north wall had
also been pushed to the east, thus distorting the north end of the east wall. These
disturbed areas are shown on the site base map (Figure 11) and were not investigated.
The only part of the cabin that appeared to retain an original semblance of the
relationship of corner logs was in the southwest corner that is shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12.

semblance to what they must have been when they were in place and first
had collapsed. View is to the northwest.

Testing focused on determining if any evidence of a chimney was present in the western
opening as mapped by Jurney or in the north or south openings (Figure 13). The eastern
opening had been totally destroyed by the three-trunk hackberry and was not explored
further. A total of 42 logs and log sections were mapped on the base map and are
individually described in Table 1 which is at the end of this chapter. At least three of the
logs that formed the upper part of the southern wall were lying roughly parallel to the
wall but in the center of the structure where the wall had apparently collapsed. In general

all the logs had suffered significant erosion since the structure was photographed in the
1950s and even since it was photographed in 1981. A single log from the eastern half of
the northern wall was sufficiently preserved to allow it to be tree-ring dated (Figure 14).
The date is 1742-1832+20 (Stahle 2008) and compared favorably to the Nichols Ranch
chronology from Northcentral Texas (Stahle and Cleaveland 1988). As shown in the
early photographs and in Table 1, many of the logs had been thinned and ranged in size
from 14 to 29 cm in height and from 7 to 19 cm in width. As indicated previously, corner
timbering consisted of half-dovetailed notches. Square-cut nails were noted in several of
the logs.

and 2 where the chimney base was being excavated by Cody Davis (blue

in the northwest corner and the log pile that is the remains of the cabin.

Testing consisted of the excavation of six 1x1 m units which are shown on the figures
above. Artifacts in the form of metal, glass, ceramics, bone and other items were
recovered from each of the units and are described below. A massive amount of roughedged limestone rock was recovered during testing of Units 1 and 2 which coincide with
the location of the western opening where Jurney had reported the hearth. As listed in
Table 2, few or no rocks were found in levels 1 and 2, i.e., 0-10 and 10-20 cm in Units 1

and 2 but essentially none were found in the other units. More than 200 rocks were
recovered from level 3 in each unit. The average rock weight was 173.7 g in Unit 1 and
175.2 g in Unit 2 and the weight of all the rocks totaled 85.5 kg for the two units. These
rocks apparently served as the base for a cat chimney and possibly for a flat hearth stone
that may have been removed after the chimney/cabin was abandoned. No evidence of a
collapsed or disintegrated log and mud chimney was encountered.

Figure 14.

opening is visible in the left center of the picture.

Nails and nail fragments were the most commonly found artifacts (N=216) and just over
a quarter of the nails are square-cut (N=67) while the remainder are wire nails (Fontana
and Greenleaf 1962:44-66; Loveday 1983). Wire nails were most common in the first
level but were accompanied by square-cut nails in each level. In levels 2 and 3, wire nails
outnumbered cut nails but the number of nails decreased with depth and there were very
few nails in level 3 and none in level 4 of Test Unit 1.
A variety of unidentified wire and metal fragments was recovered. The second most
common artifact class was plain glass fragments. A total of 80 glass fragments were
recovered from three levels in Unit 1. These include clear, amber, purple, light blue and
light green colored glass. Two adjacent pieces of clear bottle glass were marked with

“…ONE QT…” this along with other fragments was not attributed to a specific
manufacturer or date of manufacture (Toulouse 1971). There were several pieces of
unidentifiable glass from level 2. A purple hand turned neck from a bottle was recovered.
The bottle neck has a packers lip (Berge 1980:Figure 36)) and was probably a pepper
sauce bottle (Young 2008). Several small pieces of what appears to be window glass
were recovered from level 2. The eight window glass pieces had thicknesses of 1.6 mm,
1.7 mm, 1.9 mm, and 2.0 mm. According to Moir’s predictive model for dating lower to
middle class rural dwellings (Moir 1988:79), these pieces would date from the mid to late
1800’s.
Like the glass, the majority of the ceramic vessel fragments in Unit 1 consisted of
unidentifiable plain whiteware, stoneware, ironstone, porcelain and a single identifiable
rim sherd with a beaded decoration. Three unidentifiable mammal bones were recovered
from both levels 1 and 2. A few hand-made brick fragments were also found in the
second level but no complete bricks were noted in the buried deposit or were found on
ground surface.
Test Unit 2 was placed adjacent to Unit 1 along the western opening of the house. A total
of 26 wire nails and 3 cut nails were recovered from the three levels. A variety of metal
including a piece of twisted wire, an unidentifiable piece of metal, a flat head steel screw
that is 37.8 mm long, and the rim of a medium-sized tin can were also recovered.
A variety of bottle glass fragments that included amber, light green, light blue, purple and
clear colored glass was recovered from Test Unit 2. One piece of milk glass was found in
level 1 and a portion of the base to a snuff bottle was uncovered in the second level.
Six pieces of ceramics were recovered from Test Unit 2. One piece of stoneware was
excavated from the first level. The second level provided three pieces of stoneware, one
of which is a base sherd with a cream slip along with one piece of whiteware and two
pieces of ironstone. The third level in this unit had only a small fragment of a whiteware
cup handle.
A shell button was recovered from the second level of Unit 2. The button measures 14.5
mm in diameter and is 1.9 mm thick and has four holes in the center. The four holes are
uniformly spaced suggesting that the button was machine-made. Machine-made shell
buttons were introduced in Birmingham around the mid-nineteenth century (Epstein
1990:60).
Level 2 also produced a turtle bone fragment and a small unidentified mammal long
bone. The third level also provided two small mammal long bones and one pig mandible.
The unit contained two small handmade brick fragments.
Test Unit 3 is located in the center of the structure. Artifacts were recovered from both
level’s 1 and 2 but none were recovered from level 3. Test Unit 3 as a whole uncovered
more nails and other artifacts than any other unit. The first level produced 68 wire nails
along with 6 cut nails. The second level produced 16 wire nails and 3 cut nails. A variety

of unidentifiable twisted wire and metal was found within the test unit along with a rusted
metal flat file measuring 10.43 inches in length. Level 2 also produced a metal hair
barrette with the word “GOODY” imprinted on the front as well as a brass reed from a
harmonica. The barrette is probably modern and the reed was not dateable.
Numerous glass fragments were recovered from levels 1 and 2. The 50 glass bottle
fragments include clear, light blue, light green, and amber colored glass. Two fragments
of a clear glass bottle neck from level 1 have a mold line that runs up the entire neck and
rim. This indicates that the bottle was made in a two piece mold and post-dates 1900.
Level 1 also produced a portion of a porcelain doll boot. The boot is approximately 1.04
inches tall and was broken off just above the brown boot decoration. Based on other
studies in Navarro County, Young estimates its age to be turn of the century (2008). No
other doll pieces were recovered. A piece of ironstone was recovered from the first level.
Nine pieces of bone were recovered from level 2. Seven fragments that can be fitted
together form the bottom of a small turtle shell. A small cranium fragment from a large
mammal and an unidentified small mammal bone were also recovered from the same
level. Both levels of Test Unit 3 contained part of a handmade brick.
Test Unit 4 was placed at the southern most opening of the house. The unit was
excavated to a depth of 20 cm before water saturated the bottom of the unit. Levels 1 and
2 produced 5 wire nails and no complete cut nails. The only other artifacts recovered
from Test Unit 4 were two glass fragments. One was a clear bottle glass fragment and the
other was a yellow bottle fragment.
Test Unit 5 was placed south of the southwest corner of the house. The unit was
excavated to a depth of 20 cm. Levels 1 and 2 yielded 2 cut nails and 3 wire nails. A
fragment of clear bottle glass was found in level 1, but level 2 produced 2 fragments of
purple bottle glass and 6 pieces of clear bottle glass. One of the six pieces of clear bottle
glass has the letters “TAN…” across it while a second piece of clear bottle glass has the
letters “…CO…” across it. Neither of these molded marks could be used to identify the
glass manufacturer with any certainty.
Within level 1 two metal object were recovered, the first being a small scrap of rusted
metal. The second is a large rusted metal pin measuring 5.25 inches in length. The top or
head of the pin has a flat oval shape that is 1.13 inches wide. The base or tip of the pin is
round and has a 0.17 inch hole through it. The pin may be from a stove although it is
more massive than flue pins observed at Pioneer Village.
The second level in Test Unit 5 also produced two fragments of unidentified bone. A
mussel shell fragment was recovered from level 2 and is the only mussel shell recovered
from of the site. Two pieces of ironstone and two pieces of stoneware were recovered
from the first level of Test Unit 5. These include a rim sherd of ironstone and a base
sherd with a cream slip. Four unidentifiable pieces of whiteware were recovered from the
second level of the unit.

Test unit 6 was placed just north of the northern opening of the house. This test unit was
excavated to 30 cm before sterile clay was reached. In all, 5 cut nails and 15 wire nails
were recovered. Three pieces of glass were recovered from level 1: a small piece of
purple bottle glass, a piece of an amber snuff bottle neck, and an almost complete neck
and rim from a snuff bottle. The hand turned neck has a well manufactured rim and dates
to the 1890s (Young 2008). The second level contained seven pieces of glass including
four pieces clear bottle glass, a piece of dark green bottle glass, a piece of light green
bottle glass and one piece of window glass. The window glass measures 1.8 mm thick
and according to Moir (1987:79) dates to the 1860/70’s. Level 3 contained two pieces of
clear bottle glass along with one piece of milk glass.
A single piece of unidentifiable ironstone makes up the ceramics from this test unit. A
piece of twisted wire and three unidentifiable pieces metal along with one small piece of
handmade brick were recovered from level 2. A single small mammal bone was
recovered from level 3 in Test Unit 6.

In summary, testing confirmed the presence of a sheet midden similar to those
documented from much larger but contemporaneous historic farmsteads at
Richland/Chambers Lake. Little of the log cabin superstructure that was photographed in
the 1950s remains and this appears to have been the condition of the cabin when it was
first recorded. No evidence of extramural features was noted but as shown, the
surrounding area has been heavily disturbed and it is reasonable to conclude that such
features as a cistern or well, smoke house, or outhouses were filled in and leveled as the
surrounding area was farmed. Furthermore, it is reasonable to expect that if such features
have been preserved that they would contain primarily early 1900s artifact assemblages.
The cabin appears to have served as a residence rather than as a storage structure.

CONCLUSIONS
The following chapter presents conclusions about the structure, its age, its function, its
deterioration and explains why the site is not worthy for consideration on the National
Register of Historic Places.
The cabin at The Shores is an unusual structure in and of itself. The first interesting
feature is that there appears to have been an opening in all four walls. The chimney was
in the center of the west wall and the entrance was apparently in the center of the south
wall. A similar opening in the north wall may have also been a door and it is possible that
the opening in the east wall was a window but this is not common for the time. Many
cabins have a fireplace and a door in opposite walls and also have a small window in the
wall where the fireplace is. No evidence of small windows was found in the earlier
photographs or as the result of mapping or testing the cabin area. Secondly, it is unusual
to find a cat chimney in a cabin that was built after the Civil War (Jordan 1978:103) and
yet there is no evidence of the brick chimney Jurney described and the rock footings
appear to be the prime evidence of a mud cat chimney (Touchstone 1987:1-14; Overstreet
1975; Lavender 1979; Jurgelski, Candle, and Sabo 1996). If a hearth stone had been
present (Skinner 1998) it must have been removed and may have been reused elsewhere
since there would have been reason to have removed it the cat chimney had been
abandoned. Possibly the residents did not have the funds to purchase a wood-burning
cast-iron stove or a kitchen range and persisted using a fireplace up to the end of the
nineteenth century or even into the twentieth century. Thirdly, the structure seems to be
of poor or low quality construction in that no evidence of a floor was found, no elevated
sills or piers were present, and there is no evidence of framing for a door, window, or
other opening. The lack of framing nails lends support to this observation about the
structure.
Dating of the structure rests on the basis of the characteristics of the logs used in the
building, the artifacts found in the shallowly buried deposits in and immediately adjacent
to the cabin, as well as the tree-ring date. The half-dovetail notched logs were most
commonly used between 1840 and 1860 but were manufactured and used in houses as
late as 1890 (Jordan 1978:80). Thus the cabin was probably built in the mid-1800s and
this dating is confirmed by the AD 1832+20 tree-ring date provided by the Tree Ring
Laboratory at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville (Stahle 2008). No artifacts
dating to the mid-1800s were noted on the surface of the site or in the test units although
artifacts dating post-1880 were found during testing as were early 1900s artifacts.
Consequently, it appears that the cabin was occupied in its present location sometime
before 1900 and was used until some time before the Great Depression.
The function of the cabin is not clear, but based on the mud cat chimney that was once
present and certainly was part of the structure, it is clear that the cabin was used as a
residence when it was first moved on site. Although Jurney (1981) described an artifact
scatter, we do not have any information about its extent or its artifact content. In part this
is due to extensive surface disturbance but the limited evidence from testing indicates that

27

the scatter was thin and widely dispersed and thus that occupation was not intense or that
it was by a family that was not well off and heavily recycled what little they had. This is
also indicated by the small size of the structure and the absence of extra-mural features
although an outhouse and possibly an elevated water storage tank were probably present.
The twentieth century artifacts do not indicate a shift from a residence to a storage
facility and the use of wire nails and wall lining may indicate that the cabin continued to
be used as a residence. It seems likely that a cook stove may have replaced the fireplace
but this has not been demonstrated.
The cabin has significantly deteriorated since the photographs were taken in the 1950s.
This is particularly highlighted when comparing the early pictures with the picture of the
cabin taken in 1981. There does not seem to be significant deterioration of the log pile
between 1981 and 2006 but certainly many of the present logs had uneroded ends and
had not been moved before 1981. As indicated earlier, cedar roof materials are mentioned
by Jurney but are no longer present. Based on the height of the structure shown in the
1950s photographs, it is our conclusion that many of the logs were removed before 1981,
possibly for use elsewhere, maybe in other log structures or maybe for firewood or fence
posts. In any case, the remaining structure does not preserve the integrity of the structure
as it was just fifty years ago.
While numerous log structures were recorded and then documented in detail by early
1980s investigations in north-central Texas (Jurney and Moir 1987; Skinner and Baird
1985:Chapter 9), the focus has been upon recording standing structures as was done at
Joe Pool Lake and Lake Ray Roberts and on the definition and analysis of sheet middens
as done at Joe Pool and Richland/Chambers lakes. In each of these studies it was
concluded that the archaeological deposit at a particular residence was the product of
construction and subsequent occupation. The cabin at The Shores presents an interesting
contrast with most of these studies. First, this is a rare situation in Texas where historic
photographs of the structure were taken and have been preserved and where the structure
was then recorded as an archaeological site. Secondly, the structure is not in its original
construction location and yet a chimney was installed well after such features had
generally been abandoned. Thirdly, although wells and cisterns were commonly found at
farmsteads dating before and after 1900 at Richland/Chambers and at the Super Collider
study area in adjacent Ellis County (Mace 1994), no evidence of such a feature was found
at site 41NV386. Furthermore, the artifact assemblage from the site is missing some of
the commonly found domestic artifacts, particularly tin cans, recovered from log cabin
sites in Texas and the Southwest (Skinner 1967).

In summary, the history of the cabin provides a hint about life in a rural Navarro County
setting in the nineteenth century but the present collapsed and deteriorated condition of
the structure as well as the disturbed midden deposit that was once preserved at the site
do not present a cultural resource that is worthy of in place preservation or of removal to
a secure location. These factors lead to the conclusion that further testing of the mixed
deposit is unwarranted and the site should not be considered for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark.
