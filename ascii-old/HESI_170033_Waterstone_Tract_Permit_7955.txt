MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Wolff Enterprises II, LLC
(Wolff), on behalf of La Salle Municipal Utility District (MUD) Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, to conduct a
cultural resources inventory survey and assessment of the 709.7-hectare (1,753.7-acre)
Waterstone tract. The Waterstone tract consists of a series of undeveloped agricultural fields
located roughly midway between Kyle and San Marcos in southeastern Hays County, Texas. The
proposed undertaking would involve construction of mixed-use commercial and residential
development on the tract. The tract is located a short distance east of Interstate Highway (IH) 35
and is bounded on the northeast by Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 158, on the southeast by State
Highway (SH) 21 (a.k.a. Camino Road), and on the southwest by Yarrington Road. At the time
the cultural resources survey was conducted, design plans were not yet available and the specific
locations of utility easements that would be constructed, owned, and operated by La Salle MUD
Nos. 1 to 5 were unknown. Consequently, for purposes of the cultural resources survey, the
project area was considered to consist of the entire 709.7-hectare (1,753.7-acre) tract.
The proposed project includes utility easements that would be constructed, owned, and
operated by LA Salle MUD Nos. 1 to 5, which represent public utilities within the state of Texas.
Consequently, the proposed undertaking falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At this time, no federal permits or agency
involvement have been identified for the project. As the project includes a publicly sponsored
undertaking with the potential to impact cultural resources, a cultural resources inventory and
assessment of the project area was required.
From March 20 to 30, 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana Smith, with the
assistance of archeological technicians Jacob Lyons and Ben Johnson and under the overall
direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive survey of the project
area to locate any cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed undertaking. Kathryn
St. Clair, architectural historian, assisted with architectural evaluations and historical research on
sites containing standing architecture or remnants of standing structures. Horizon’s archeologists
traversed the project area on foot and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for
aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources.
The vast majority of the project area is characterized by active agricultural fields that had
recently been planted for the season. Small copses of hackberry and cedar trees are scattered

Management Summary

throughout the project area; these are typically associated with historic-age standing structures
on archeological sites. The Clear Fork of Plum Creek and two of its tributaries flow eastward
through the northern portion of the project area, and unnamed tributaries of Hemphill Creek drain
the southern portion of the project area to the south. Typically, the channels associated with
these drainages were dry at the time of the survey, though one poorly drained segment of the
Clear Fork of Plum Creek retained water. Standing water was also present in scattered, poorly
drained areas in the northern portion of the project area, though the agricultural fields that
characterize the vast majority of the project area were typically dry. Two large stock ponds or
small, artificial lakes are present in the north-central portion of the project area north of the only
currently operating farm within the project area (recorded as site 41HY539). Two main roads
traverse the project area—FM 158 crosses the project area from southwest to northeast, and a
private gravel road crosses the project area between SH 21 on the southeast and FM 158 on the
northwest—and a number of ephemeral field roads skirt the edges of the active fields. Visibility
of the modern ground surface was characteristically excellent in the agricultural fields (100%),
though ground surface visibility in the small forested patches was typically obscured by grasses
and shrubs (<30%).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 1.2 hectares (3.0 acres) within
project areas measuring more than 40.5 hectares (100.0 acres) in size. As such, 585 shovel tests
would be required within the 709.7-hectare (1,753.7-acre) project area. Horizon excavated a total
of 223 shovel tests during the survey. While the shovel testing density did not meet the TSMASS
requirements, the shovel testing regimen is considered to be more than adequate to assess the
subsurface cultural resources potential of the project area. The vast majority of the project area
consists of recently plowed fields, and visibility of the modern ground surface was excellent across
most of the project area, with the exception of a few isolated stands of vegetation. As such, shovel
testing was employed judgmentally to determine whether or not the potential existed for intact
archeological deposits to occur below the active plowzone, which averaged approximately 30.0 to
35.0 centimeters (11.8 to 13.8 inches) in depth within the project area. The majority of the cultural
materials observed during the survey were constrained to the modern ground surface, and all of
the subsurface cultural materials observed were found within the plowzone. As such, the shovel
testing confirmed that all cultural materials within the project area are confined to disturbed
contexts on the modern ground surface and within the active plowzone.
Eleven newly recorded archeological sites were documented during the survey—
41HY536 to 41HY546. Nine of the 11 sites (41HY436 to 41HY543 and 41HY546) consist of the
remnants of early to mid-20th-century farmsteads and/or scatters of historic-age domestic debris.
Two of the 11 sites (41HY544 and 41HY545) consist exclusively of aboriginal artifact scatters
dated to unspecified prehistoric timeframes, and secondary cultural components composed of
sparse scatters of aboriginal artifacts were also observed on three of the nine historic-age sites
(41HY537, 41HY540, and 41HY543). All 11 sites are recommended as ineligible for designation
as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) and for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) based on the poor condition of the sites and their low potential to contribute meaningfully
to an understanding of the historic and/or prehistoric past No further investigations are warranted
on these sites in connection with the proposed undertaking.

In addition, the mapped location of one previously recorded site located within the project
area, 41HY426, was revisited in an attempt to re-locate and re-investigate the site. When it was
originally recorded in 2006, this site consisted only of an ephemeral field scatter of early 20thcentury domestic debris, including two glass shards. Horizon inspected the modern ground
surface at the mapped site location and excavated several shovel tests in the surrounding area.
No cultural resources were observed at the mapped location of site 41HY426. The two isolated
artifacts that composed the site in 2006 have probably been reincorporated into the plowzone.
Site 41HY426 was previously determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further
archeological investigations are warranted on this site.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or for inclusion in the NRHP according
to 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further
archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However,
human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety
Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery,
and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified immediately.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
1,753.7-acre Waterstone Tract, San Marcos, Hays County, Texas

DRAFT

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Wolff Enterprises II, LLC
(Wolff), on behalf of La Salle Municipal Utility District (MUD) Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, to conduct a
cultural resources inventory survey and assessment of the 709.7-hectare (1,753.7-acre)
Waterstone tract. The Waterstone tract consists of a series of undeveloped agricultural fields
located roughly midway between Kyle and San Marcos in southeastern Hays County, Texas. The
proposed undertaking would involve construction of mixed-use commercial and residential
development on the tract. The tract is located a short distance east of Interstate Highway (IH) 35
and is bounded on the northeast by Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 158, on the southeast by State
Highway (SH) 21 (a.k.a. Camino Road), and on the southwest by Yarrington Road. At the time
the cultural resources survey was conducted, design plans were not yet available and the specific
locations of utility easements that would be constructed, owned, and operated by La Salle MUD
Nos. 1 to 5 were unknown. Consequently, for purposes of the cultural resources survey, the
project area was considered to consist of the entire 709.7-hectare (1,753.7-acre) tract (Figures 11 to 1-2).
The proposed project includes utility easements that would be constructed, owned, and
operated by LA Salle MUD Nos. 1 to 5, which represent public utilities within the state of Texas.
Consequently, the proposed undertaking falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At this time, no federal permits or agency
involvement have been identified for the project. As the project includes a publicly sponsored
undertaking with the potential to impact cultural resources, a cultural resources inventory and
assessment of the project area was required.
From March 20 to 30, 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana Smith, with the
assistance of archeological technicians Jacob Lyons and Ben Johnson and under the overall
direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive survey of the project
area to locate any cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed undertaking. Kathryn
St. Clair, architectural historian, assisted with architectural evaluations and historical research on
sites containing standing architecture or remnants of standing structures. The cultural resources
investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area,
and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)
in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure,

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located approximately midway between Kyle and San Marcos along
the southeastern edge of Hays County, Texas, near the boundary of two significant physiographic
provinces—the Edwards Plateau and the Blackland Prairie. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow
physiographic zone situated between the Edwards Plateau on the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain
on the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the
Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the
Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often
ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and
Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a
distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains
composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the
Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this
transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation,
and animal life.
Physiographically, the project area is situated on a series of gently rolling uplands
dissected by the Clear Fork of Plum Creek and two of its tributaries as well as by tributaries of
Hemphill Creek. The project area slopes down generally to the southeast, spanning elevations
ranging from 197.3 to 211.3 meters (647.0 to 693.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl).
Hydrologically, the project area is situated within the Guadalupe River basin. Hays
County’s numerous streams generally flow in an easterly direction. The principal waterways are
Bear, Cypress, and Onion creeks as well as the Blanco and San Marcos rivers. The Edwards
Aquifer underlies the eastern portion of the county, and the San Marcos Springs, located north of
the City of San Marcos, are the second largest in Texas, delivering over 102 million gallons daily.
The northern half of the project area is situated on upland landforms dissected by the Clear Fork
of Plum Creek and two of its tributaries, and the southern half is drained by tributaries of Hemphill
Creek. The Clear Fork of Plum Creek flows generally southeastward, discharging into Plum
Creek proper northeast of Luling in Caldwell County. Plum Creek meanders generally southward
a short distance before flowing into the San Marcos River southeast of Luling. Hemphill Creek
flows generally southwards, discharging directly into the Sam Marcos River near Martindale in

Caldwell County. The San Marcos River, in turn, meanders generally southeastward across the
coastal plain, discharging into the Guadalupe River near Gonzales in Gonzales County. The
Guadalupe River continues southeastward, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico near
Port Lavaca.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Hays County is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age sedimentary rock strata,
while areas of alluvium may be present adjacent to major streams and rivers. Geologically, the
project area is situated on Late Pleistocene-age fluviatile terrace deposits of the Leona Formation
(Qle), which forms a broad terrace southeast of Kyle that is composed of sand, clay, and gravel
up to 15.2 meters (50.0 feet) thick (Fisher 1974). The project area traverses a mosaic of soil units
typically composed of calcareous clayey alluvium of Late Pleistocene age (Table 2-1; Figure 2-1)
(NRCS 2017). No Holocene-age alluvial sediments are mapped within the project area, though
thin veneers of Holocene-age alluvial and/or colluvial deposits may be expected in undisturbed
areas.
While aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep alluvial sediments
adjacent to major streams in Central Texas, no Holocene-age sediments are mapped within the
project area. Furthermore, the majority of the project area is characterized by active agricultural
fields, and a century or more of plowing and harvesting activities has thoroughly displaced and
mixed surficial and near-surface sediments within the project area. Subsurface archeological
deposits may be present within any areas of intact alluvium, though the overall lack of such
contexts within the project area suggests that cultural resources would be constrained to the
modern ground surface or in shallowly buried contexts in disturbed settings lacking integrity.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was considerably
cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was more heavily
forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late
Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying
trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by
grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period,
the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable. The deciduous forests
had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming
trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there
appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to
5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental
conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.

Hays County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is influenced
primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by polar air
masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and fall.
Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate characterized
by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas manifest
regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west
and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and
Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical
subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (cm) (32.0 inches [in]) and
temperature averages 19°Celsius (C) (67°Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in
August (the warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time,
however, drier periods lasting from three to seven years, when total annual rainfall ranged from

30.5 to 63.5 centimeters (12 to 25 inches), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to
127.0 centimeters (45.0 to 50.0 inches) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall. Two
extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain that fell within an 18hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9-centimeters (22.0inches) deluge that fell in less than three hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently
that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east
often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from
the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the
region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair
1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces
and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943). Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary,
characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes
through western Williamson County, northwest of the project area. Rainfall in the Texan province
is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite (1948) as a C2 (moist
subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and
hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this soil
type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas include
the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies.
Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat and bog
marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert pocket gopher
(Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse

(Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail rabbit
(Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), ground squirrel
(Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana), hispid pocket mouse
(Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and
jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the Austroriparian province—eastern
box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—occur in the Texan.
Sixteen species of lizards, including seven grassland and nine forest species, are also
found, including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis) (grassland
species), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard (Sceloporus
olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink (Eumeces
obsoletus) (forest species). Only 5 species of urodele fauna are known from this area, including
small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), and
eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts as a barrier to urodele
distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west and the Austroriparian
fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the Texan
into the Austroriparian province include Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s chorus
frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile and
amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water snake
(Nerodia rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early
historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic
hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of
North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian
bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and
settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central
Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There
is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is
divided into two periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points
(i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which
is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and
Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most markedly,
burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the Late
Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In addition,
the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute evidence
of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially accounts for the
lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed

South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay. However,
European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The first half of
the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as the first
effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social systems.
This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data suggest population
declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation on the part of the
Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement of Texas began in
the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished.
During the Spanish period, the region lay at the edge of the main route from San Antonio
to East Texas, the Old San Antonio Road.1 In 1691, Domingo Terán de los Ríos crossed the
southern edge of the county on his way to the East Texas missions and the Red River. The
Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition explored the upper San Marcos River in 1709, and Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis was attacked by Apaches in 1714 at the San Marcos River crossing. A
mission to be called San Marcos was authorized in 1729 near the site of present San Marcos, but
the authorization was later rescinded in favor of San Antonio. San Xavier Mission and San
Francisco Xavier Presidio were located briefly at the site in 1755-56, but no permanent settlement
was attempted until 1807, when some 80 persons were moved to the Old San Antonio Road
crossing of the San Marcos River. San Marcos de Neve, one of a chain of defense settlements,
was abandoned four years later, after flooding and attacks by Comanche and Tonkawa Indians.
To encourage settlement after the Mexican War for Independence, the government of Coahuila
and Texas issued land grants in the county to Juan Martín Veramendi in 1831, Juan Vicente
Campos in 1832, and Thomas Jefferson Chambers in 1834. The first Anglo-American settler in
Hays County, Thomas G. McGehee, was issued a league of land in 1835 by the Mexican
government and was farming north of the site of present San Marcos in 1846.
On March 1, 1848, the state legislature formed Hays County from territory formerly part of
Travis County. William W. Moon, Eli T. Merriman, and Mike Sessom, original settlers and
members of John Coffee Hays’ company of Texas Rangers, worked with General Edward
Burleson, a member of the Texas Senate, to have the new county named for Hays. County
organization and the designation of San Marcos as the county seat gave impetus to settlement;
the population grew from 387 in 1850 to 2,126 in 1860. The county shrank slightly on February 12,
1858, when it lost acreage to the new Blanco County and gained a portion of Comal County. On
January 10, 1862, the legislature again transferred another small area to Blanco County.
Boundaries remained stable for nearly a century, until resurvey of the Hays-Travis county line in
1955 added more than 16,000 acres to Hays County.
A stage line from Austin to San Antonio crossed the county in 1848, the year that Edward
Burleson built the first sawmill. W.A. Thompson built the first cotton gin in the early 1850s, and,
between 1855 and 1885, Ezekiel Nance built and operated five gins, five gristmills, a sawmill, a
shingle mill, and a beef packery. Alfred B.F. Kerr organized the first church in Hays County in

1847, and a school was built at San Marcos in 1849. Another school was opened at Snake Lake
in 1851, and John D. Pitts built a school in Stringtown before 1860. The Johnson Institute,
founded in 1852 by Thomas Jefferson Johnson, drew students from a large area of Central Texas
until it closed in 1872.
The early settlers of Hays County were a mix of old Texans and Georgia and Arkansas
immigrants. With the coming of the Civil War, most of the residents favored secession. Colonel
Peter C. Woods’ 36th Texas Cavalry regiment was organized at Camp Clark, in neighboring
Guadalupe County, in 1862; Company A was primarily made up of Hays County men. During the
war, county beef helped to feed Confederate forces. Shortly after the war’s end, Colonel George
F. Snyder, a Georgian, established the first newspaper in Hays County, the Pioneer. During
Reconstruction, a Ku Klux Klan group was formed, and, in May 1876, a military organization, the
San Marcos Greys, was formed.
George Neill drove the first herd of cattle from Hays County to Kansas in 1867, and other
drives followed. Farming also became more profitable in the eastern part of the county and helped
encourage a fresh influx of settlers. By 1878, the county was out of debt, several new
communities had been organized, and schools had grown in number to match the increased
population. The Coronal Institute was founded in 1866 followed by the San Marcos public school
system in 1870. Southwest Texas Normal School was authorized at the turn of the century and
opened in 1903 as a teacher-training institution; it became Southwest Texas State University in
1969. San Marcos Baptist Academy was established in 1907.
In 1880, the first Hays County rail line, built by the International-Great Northern Railroad,
was completed to San Marcos from Austin; it later extended to San Antonio. Another population
boom followed the railroad. The county population nearly doubled, from 7,555 in 1880 to 14,142
in 1900, and then remained virtually unchanged for the next 50 years despite the influences of
World War I and the depression of the 1930s. Even the economic stimulus of World War II had
only momentary effect. Hays County remained predominantly agricultural; almost 90% of the
mid-1960s farm income came from livestock. Not until the establishment of the Gary Job Corps
Training Center on the site of the former Gary Air Force Base in 1964 and the growth of enrollment
at the university in San Marcos did Hays County begin a period of steady growth—from 19,934 in
1960 to 27,642 in 1970; 40,594 in 1980; and 65,614 in 1990. Although agriculture remained
significant in county economics, nonagricultural income, primarily at the educational and training
facilities, played an even larger role. The 1979 per capita income of $6,009, however, remained
well below the state average of $8,778.
Since early in the century, Hays County has enjoyed a steady influx of tourists attracted
by the caves, springs, and spas of Wimberley and San Marcos. Aquarena Springs and Wonder
Caves are particularly well known. Camp Ben McCulloch, near Driftwood, was organized in 1896
as a site for reunions of the United Confederate Veterans; their descendants continue the annual
tradition. More recently, the county caught the attention of environmentalists. Ezell Cave, a
watery cavern in San Marcos, is the habitat of several rare animal species, including the Texas
blind salamander, and six of the 10 known varieties of aquatic cave fauna are found only in this
cave and its underground waters. The only known habitat of the San Marcos salamander is San
Marcos Springs, and two other unique fish of the springs, the fountain darter and San Marcos

gambusia, were classed as endangered in 1990. Also on the endangered list is Texas wild rice,
which is not known to exist outside a small area near the springs.
During the 1970s and 1980s, growth in the northern and eastern parts of the county was
influenced by the expanding Austin metropolitan area and the Austin-San Antonio urban strip
along IH 35. In 1973, Hays County became part of the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area. In
addition to the county seat, San Marcos, which had a population of 28,743 in 1990, other county
population centers are Wimberley (2,403), Kyle (2,225), Buda (1,795), Dripping Springs (1,033),
and Hays (252).
San Marcos is the county seat of Hays County. It was the site of several Spanish attempts
at colonization before it became the center of Anglo-American settlement in the area. The first
such attempt, in 1755, saw the short-lived establishment of the San Xavier missions and the
presidio of San Francisco Xavier. These were relocated less than a year later, and the
headwaters of the San Marcos River remained unsettled for another half-century. In 1808, the
Spanish governor of Texas, Manuel Antonio Cordero y Bustamante, sponsored the civil
settlement of San Marcos de Neve near the same site, but floods and Indian raids prompted its
abandonment in 1812. In November 1846, Thomas G. McGehee became the first AngloAmerican to settle in the vicinity of the San Marcos Springs, but William W. Moon has been
identified as the original resident of the site that became San Marcos proper. Moon was soon
joined by other former members of John C. Hays's company of Texas Rangers and by Gen.
Edward Burleson. Caton Erhard opened the first store and post office by 1847, and the First
Methodist Church began soon after. The Texas Legislature organized Hays County on March 1,
1848, and designated the young community as the county seat. In 1851, General Burleson,
William Lindsey, and Dr. Eli T. Merriman took possession of a 259.0-hectare (640.0-acre) section
of the Juan Veramendi grant and laid out the town center. Tarbox and Brown stagecoaches linked
San Marcos with Austin and San Antonio in 1848, and the town began its development as the
commercial center for the cart trade between area farmers and ranchers and coastal commission
merchants. It also became a center for ginning and milling local agricultural products. Slowed for
a while by the Civil War, the population in 1870 had grown only to 742, but, in the decade following
the arrival of the International-Great Northern Railroad in 1881, it reached 2,335. In that decade
the town supported two banks, an opera house, and a variety of stores, saloons, and other
businesses.
Cattle and cotton production in the area provided the basis for the gradual but steady
growth of San Marcos as a center for commerce and transportation. The chartering in 1899 and
subsequent opening in 1903 of Southwest Texas State Normal School and of the San Marcos
Baptist Academy in 1907 established education as an important local industry. By the second
decade of the 20th century, San Marcos counted more than 4,000 residents. On the eve of World
War II, the population was estimated to be 5,500, and the town had 200 businesses. During and
after World War II, the city's economy began to diversify, and growth accelerated. Wartime
demand provided the initial stimulus for development of a light industrial and manufacturing
sector; it was reported after the war that the financial resources of the city had increased 500%
from prewar levels. In the 1960s, with the emergence of Aquarena Springs and Wonder Cave as
important attractions, the tourist industry became a reliable and growing source of income. The

expansion of Southwest Texas State University into an important regional institution, as well as
the establishment in 1965 of the Gary Job Corps Training Center, not only made education the
single largest employer in the city but also helped to account for a 48% increase in population,
from 12,713 in 1962 to 18,860 in 1972. Industrial development continued apace through the
1970s; among the 400 businesses recorded by 1980 were manufacturers of furniture, sheet metal
products, plastics, woolens, lighting fixtures, telecommunication devices, baked goods,
construction materials, and tortillas. Austin's emergence as a regional metropolitan center is
another cause of the growth of San Marcos since the 1950s; in 1973, Hays County and San
Marcos became part of the Austin Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area.

HISTORIC CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT AREA
Early Settlement in Hays County

The project area is located in the eastern, rural section of Hays county; southeast of Kyle
and northeast of San Marcos. The small community of Uhland is approximately 4.8 kilometers
(3.0 miles) northeast of the project area. The local terrain is characterized by clay and chalk soils
that natively support post oak trees, though most of the natural vegetation has been cleared from
the project area to create agricultural fields.
Historically, rural communities of the Blackland Prairie included small villages like Uhland
and Niederwald and larger towns like Kyle and Buda surrounded by family farms ranging from
32.4 to 101.2 hectares (80.0 to 250.0) acres in size. The smaller communities were often located
in the center of farming districts defined by ethnic or religious origins or by limiting topographical
features such as rivers and creeks. They functioned somewhat like neighborhoods within urban
areas that have a school, one or two churches, a few grocers, and a gas station to serve the
immediate needs of the surrounding households. Nearly every such hamlet in the Blackland
Prairie had a cotton gin. Larger towns in the region, like Buda and Kyle, were generally located
at the crossroads of two or more county roads, often with railroad access, and supported more
diverse commercial, institutional, and social activities. Such towns generally had several general
merchandise stores, a few specialty retail shops, a small railroad hotel or inn, and a few cafes or
restaurants. Religious and institutional buildings included a regional high school, several
churches serving different denominations, and occasionally a cultural or civic building such as a
community hall or masonic lodge. Larger rural towns sometimes had banks, law offices, and
doctors’ offices or small clinics. They usually had several small industries, including one or more
gins, a lumber yard, and sometimes a mill or quarry (Myers 2004).
Kyle is located off of IH-35 approximately 12.9 kilometers (8.0 miles) north of San Marcos
and 32.3 kilometers (20.0 miles) south of Austin in southeastern Hays County. Established on
July 24, 1880, when David E. Moore and Fergus Kyle (for whom the town was named) deeded
80.9 hectares (200.0 acres) for a town site to the International-Great Northern Railroad. The new
town drew residents and businesses from Mountain City (4.8 kilometers [3.0 miles] to the west)
and Blanco (6.4 kilometers [4.0 miles] to the west). The community’s population exceeded 500 by
1882 but later declined. Kyle was incorporated in 1928 as a general-law city with a mayor and
five council members (Strom 2017).

Beginning in the 1860s, several communities developed within Hays County, with the
population growing from 387 in 1850 to 2,126 in 1860. Following the Civil War, there was an
influx of settlers to Hays County. In 1880, the opening of the Great Northern Railroad through the
county drew many families and immigrants to the area. During this period, many areas of the
county were devoted to the raising of sheep and goats, and large amounts of wool and mohair
was produced annually. In the last two decades of the 19th century, the eastern part of the county
(where the project area is located) was settled by many German immigrants. The majority of the
German Baptists lived in an area referred to as Plum Creek Valley. The prairie within this valley
was known as Pecan Springs. Pecan Springs was part of the original Hemphill Survey (Marder
1995).
The founder of Pecan Springs was Colonel R.J. Sledge of North Carolina. Colonel Sledge
became a planter and purchased his first tract of land (102.0 hectares [252.0 acres]) in Hays
County on October 23, 1875. He later purchased 493.7 hectares (1,220.0 acres), including Pecan
Springs, in 1876. He eventually built a house, servant and employee quarters, outbuildings, and
a cotton gin. Between 1875 and 1880, Colonel Sledge acquired 2,023.4 hectares (5,000.0 acres)
in this area. He planned to use the hillsides and prairies for grazing sheep and cattle and to use
the valleys for raising cotton and foodstuffs. Colonel Sledge eventually sold portions of his land
to other German settlers, many of which were from nearby New Braunfels. He further recruited
immigrant families from the German town of Kassel in efforts to settle Pecan Springs (Marder
1995). Churches and other community buildings were built as the German population grew in
this area east of Kyle.
In 1891, the county judge created school district boundaries within Hays County. The
Hemphill Elementary School was established on the William Hemphill Survey from land
purchased from David Crews (Stovall et al. 1986).
Approximately 600,000 Germans arrived in America between 1831 and 1847 (Myers
2004). Following the Civil War, German immigration was encouraged by railroad companies that
advertised their lands extensively in Germany. Most of the distinctively German settlements in
Hays County, such as Uhland and Niederwald, date from this period. After emancipation, many
former slave owners moved west, while others gave up cotton farming and began subdividing
their plantations, breaking them into smaller parcels and selling them piecemeal. This allowed
later immigrant families, like Germans and Swedes, to establish farms in areas where previously
land had not been available. German immigration slowed in the 20th century but continued to be
a significant factor in Texas until the 1920s (Jordan 1969).
During the 1880s, when cotton was first cultivated on a large scale on the Blackland
Prairie, the community of Uhland formed along the eastern edge of the county. Uhland
encompassed an earlier community named Live Oak, which had been founded around 1860, but
Uhland was settled largely by an influx of German farmers who had moved into the area by 1880.
From the 1880s until the turn of the century, Uhland was an unnamed collection of
farmsteads with a cluster of buildings, including a blacksmith shop and general mercantile store,
built in 1892. By 1900, the area’s population warranted a post office; it was named Uhland in
honor of the German poet Ludwig Uhland (1787-1862). The village grew very little beyond the

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

few businesses that served the immediate needs of the area's agricultural economy, but the
surrounding farmsteads prospered and increased in the early 20th century. Virtually all of area’s
farmers were of German descent and were members of the Evangelical Church in the 1930s
(Marder 1995).
An Official Texas Historical Marker (OTHM) denotes the Immanuel Baptist Church located
on FM 150 approximately 0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile) northeast of the project area. The church was
first organized in 1883 at the home of George Wiegand, a German settler. The church was formed
as the German Baptist Church of Kyle. By 1893, a church building was constructed on land
acquired from Frank Marstellar and later reconstructed in 1940 following a fire (THC 2017).
In general, German farmers tended to own small, family-operated farms concentrating on
a variety of crops and a balance of pasture, field, orchard, and garden. They raised corn, cotton,
and cattle like their Anglo neighbors, but large cotton plantations using slave labor and
concentrating on a monoculture cash crop were largely unknown to them (Myers 2004).
The German community in the Pecan Springs area was severely impacted by a hail and
wind storm in 1925 followed by a drought. Too much rain during 1926 resulted in bollworms and
leaf worms that destroyed the cotton crops. The crop failures forced many families into
bankruptcy. Those not affected by agricultural losses often faced other hardships from the Great
Depression. By the time of World War II, many families had moved to urban centers, including
Austin and San Antonio, in search of work. Farms were often leased out to tenant farmers and
extended families started to disperse (Marder 1995).
The turn of the 20th century marked a prolific period of harvest and crop production for
farmers in this region. With the abundant harvest, farmers needed extra help. During this period,
many families from Mexico migrated to the Hays County agricultural fields and became tenant
farmers, eventually purchasing farms and land of their own. The 1900, 1910, and 1920 census
records indicate that many Mexican families were renting and living on property within the project
area during this period of time. This area of Hays County resulted in an enclave of the Mexican
and Hispanic population. In 1905, a Latin-American school district was formed on the Hemphill
Survey tract to serve the children of the growing community.
Agriculture and Ranching
The southeastern corner of Hays County is part of the Blackland Prairie region, one of the
smaller agricultural zones in the county. Although ranching and raising livestock were historically
the more prevalent agricultural activities in the larger Edwards Plateau region of Hays County
(primarily west of IH-35), the prairie region supported cotton and dairy production, which were
common in and around the project area (Moore et al. 2013). Cotton was the primary crop
produced in the area, grown as early as the 1850s to 1925. The area experienced droughts,
heavy rains, insect infestations, and careless farming techniques that contributed to the decline
of the productivity of the land in the 1920s (Hindes 1996). Soon after, the Depression contributed
to the decline in the cotton market, and, subsequently, the growth of the area.
The Blackland Prairie was not ideal for subsistence farming. The labor involved in
cultivating the black clay is considerably more intensive than that required along the alluvial

DRAFT

corridors; therefore, farmers raised cash crops, primarily cotton. Wild fluctuations in cotton prices
and production made it difficult to predict income and curb debt. Increased production invariably
followed a good year, flooding the market and forcing prices down. Extension services and farm
cooperatives encouraged diversification, but farmers planted what they thought would return the
most money in a given year, and that was usually cotton.
There were soon farms of all sizes on the Blackland Prairie area of Texas, but few
contained as many as 404.7 hectares (1,000.0 acres). At the beginning of World War I, cotton
bale production had fallen drastically; however, during the war, demand drove cotton prices to
unprecedented levels and farmers planted as much as they could. When the war ended, prices
plummeted. The boom and bust cycle was typical of cotton prices in the late 19th and early
20th centuries. Another problem that plagued cotton production was the boll weevil, which
appeared in the Corpus Christi area around 1893 and quickly spread to other cotton-producing
areas of the South (Myers 2004).
The revival of cotton on the Blackland Prairie in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was
based largely on tenant farming. In Hays County, the rise in cotton economy dates from the arrival
of the railroads in 1880 until about 1925. Floods, droughts, and poor land use, combined with the
invasion of the boll weevil, ruined the county's cotton fields in the mid-1920s. World War II sent
thousands of young Texans abroad and many never returned to the farm after the war (Myers
2004).
In the early 20th century, the percentage of tenant-occupied farms grew compared with
those tended by resident owners. Many farm owners lived in nearby towns and engaged in other
occupations while they leased or otherwise profited from their land. There were three categories
of arrangements between absentee farmers and their tenants—sharecropping, share renting, and
cash renting. Tenants agreed to furnish the landowner with part of the crop they raised, usually
a third or a half (Myers 2004).
By 1950, the majority of people recorded in the census of Hays County lived in towns
rather than on farms or ranches. That trend continued through the second half of the 20th century
as farms and ranches were divided into suburban housing tracts.
Rural landscape features included plowed fields and pastures fenced with cedar post and
barbed wire fencing, timber lots along creeks, and stock ponds. Historic-age properties tend to
be clustered late 19th and early 20th-century farmsteads containing a one- or one-and-a-halfstory, wood-frame dwelling set on cedar post, concrete block, or brick pier foundations and one
to 20 agricultural buildings or structures set near the dwelling, frequently to the rear. On historicage farms, the building complex contains the primary dwelling, smaller houses for tenants or
shelters for hired hands, and animal and vehicle barns and sheds. Narrow graveled or packed
earth driveways lead to the front or main entry of houses from county roadways. A few farmsteads
contain tenant houses or other, sometimes temporary, accommodations for hired hands during
peak periods of agricultural activity, such as harvest. All contain outbuildings associated with
agriculture. The number and type of outbuildings varies depending on the crops, livestock, and
scope of a particular farm (Myers 2004).

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

The rural landscape in the Blackland Prairie featured farm complexes situated on high
ground and set back some distance from the nearest public roads. Farm building complexes
were typically positioned near the center of their farms to minimize the distance from barn to field
and thus reduce the strain on draught animals. Farmsteads typically contained a primary family
dwelling, one or more small tenant houses, privies, smoke houses, storage sheds, animal and
vehicle barns, and small animal shelters such as pig pens and chicken coops. Auxiliary structures
included cisterns, wells, well houses, windmills, and dipping troughs (Lassell 2010).
Agricultural resources include a variety of buildings with varying roles in the production of
crops and livestock. Associated property types include, but are not limited to:



Farmsteads/ranches/plantations with support buildings, such as barns, dairies, sheds,
coops, cribs, water tanks, windmills, and stock tanks.



Processing plants and storage buildings, such as grist mills, cotton gins, and grain
elevators.

Irrigation Systems
Ranching has played a major role in Texas agriculture since the early 1700s. By the late
1880s, the open range ended and fenced pastures occupied the landscape. During World War I,
the Texas cattle industry boomed. However, deflation and bankruptcies followed in the 1920s,
followed by the stock market bust of 1929. The cattle industry suffered, and plunging prices,
droughts, overstocked ranges, and scarce feed plagued the industry. Things slowly improved in
the 1930s, and, by the 1950s, the cattle industry was conducted as an enterprise, though some
ranchers elected to run stock farms with small heads and crops (Lassell and Wolfenden 2009).
Livestock resources include a variety of buildings with varying roles in the raising of
livestock. The form of individual structures, as well as their arrangement, often provides an
indication of the type of ranching practiced. Associated property types include:



Farmsteads/ranches/plantations with support buildings, such as barns, dairies, sheds,
coops, cribs, water tanks, windmills, and stock tanks.



Processing plants and storage facilities, such as meat-packing plants, feed lots,
railroad siding for transporting livestock, livestock pens, and cattle chutes.

Transportation Networks: Old San Antonio Road (Camino Real) and the Railroad
The Camino Real was a path across Texas connecting the missions. It was used
predominantly by Spanish settlers to transport supplies and facilitate trade between Mexico City
and East Texas before Texas independence. Texans continued to use the trail as a main trade
artery until the advent of the railroad in the late 1800s (TSHA 2014).
More a series of trails than a highway, the Camino Real had a number of routes at various
times. Many of the original paths were links between Native American settlements. Major
expansions of the trail by the Spanish occurred in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The

section of the trail that travels through Hays County (State Highway [SH] 21) is referred to as the
“Old San Antonio Road” (TSHA 2014).
The Texas Legislature appropriated $5,000 to survey the historic trail in 1915, and the
Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) placed granite markers along the surveyed route.
The survey tracked the trail from the Rio Grande near Laredo to San Antonio; then passing
through Hays, Caldwell, Bastrop, Lee, Burleson, Robertson, Brazos, Madison, Leon, Houston,
Cherokee, Nacogdoches, San Augustine, and Sabine counties; into Louisiana. In 1929, the trail
was declared a historic trail of Texas to be maintained and preserved by the highway department.
By 1949, the majority of the historic trail had been paved, and it is still in use as SH 21 and other
smaller state roads and highways (TSHA 2014). The Old San Antonio Road, the main trade route
between San Antonio and East Texas during the Spanish Period, runs through the county,
passing by the project area as modern-day SH 21 (TSHA 2014).
The Camino Real de Los Tejas incorporates SH 21, which forms the southeastern
boundary of the current project area. This section of the Camino Real (or “Old San Antonio Road”)
is considered a National Historic Trail; however, it has not been evaluated for its eligibility for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The section of SH 21 south of Uhland
that passes by the project area is a two-lane asphalt highway, and it is devoid of any DAR markers
(Texas Designs 2017). This was confirmed by field observation. This section of SH 21 is not
included in the NRHP-listed Old Austin to San Antonio Post Road Historic District, which was
listed on the NRHP in 2006. The section of the roadway adjacent to the project area is not
considered eligible for listing on the NRHP for purposes of the current investigation.
By the late 19th century, improved transportation aided settlement growth and agricultural
dispersion. In 1880, the International and Great Northern Railroad established lines from San
Marcos to Austin and created a stop in Kyle and Buda. By 1881, the track extended to San
Antonio (Lassell and Wolfenden 2009). After the arrival of the railroad in Hays County, the
population boomed from 7,555 in 1880 to 14,142 in 1900 (Lassell and Wolfenden 2009). The
railroad allowed farmers an inexpensive and efficient way to export large quantities of crops and
cattle. From the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries, the towns of Kyle and Uhland, as well as
most others in the county, had economies based on agriculture and ranching, particularly cotton
production. The railroad through nearby Buda and Kyle not only facilitated shipping of cattle,
cotton, and other crops, but also tenant and migrant farmers coming up from Mexico in the early
1900s (Hindes 1996). An Interception Center was established in San Marcos in 1942 as an aid
to migratory labor supply and demand (Hindes 1996).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed the THC’s online Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and Texas Historic Sites Atlas (THSA), the National Park
Service’s (NPS) online National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory’s (TARL) files, and the Texas State Historical Association’s (TSHA) The
Handbook of Texas Online for information on previously recorded cultural resources sites and
previous archeological investigations conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the
project area. The archival research indicated the presence of three known archeological sites
and one cemetery within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the project area (Table 4-1; Figure 41) (NPS 2017; THC 2017). The majority of the known archeological sites and the cemetery are
located well outside the boundaries of the project area and would not be disturbed as a result of
the proposed undertaking.
One of the previously recorded archeological sites, 41HY426, is located within the
southwestern portion of the project area. When it was originally recorded in 2006, site 41HY426
consisted of an ephemeral scatter of domestic debris, including only two glass shards, reportedly
dating to the early 20th century. These two artifacts likely represented field scatter associated
with nearby farmsteads and farming activities rather than the primary location of historic-age
activity, and it is questionable whether or not these isolated artifacts warranted recording as a
formal archeological site. Nevertheless, site 41HY426 was determined to be ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP, and no further archeological investigations have since been conducted on
the site.
Two previous linear cultural resources surveys traverse the southwestern corner of the
current project area (see Figure 4-1). Both of these surveys were conducted in association with
a proposed realignment of FM 110 (Galindo 2013; Roger et. al 2007). It was during the earlier of
these two prior surveys that site 41HY426 was recorded within the current project area.
Horizon also reviewed existing literature pertinent to the historic context of the project
area. Hindes (1996) and Marder (1995) provided general information on the history and
development of Hays County that contributed to the historic context presented in Chapter 3.0,
though these reports did not list any identified resources within the project area. Myers (2004)
provided additional historic context information and expectations regarding resource types that
may be expected to be present within the project area. The reviewed literature identified various

resource types associated with the historical farming, ranching, and dairy industries and suburban
development, with buildings dating from 1857 to 1945, though no resources specific to the project
area have been previously identified.
Historical US Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps and aerial photographs, Hays
County deed records, and Hays County Central Appraisal District records were consulted for
additional information about potential historic-age resources within the project area. Topographic
maps from 1911 and 1919 (Figures 4-2 to 4-3) and early highway maps from 1946 and 1961
(Figures 4-4 to 4-5) show clustered areas of development near Kyle and San Marcos, with very
little development within the primarily rural surrounding agricultural land. While recent suburban
development has begun to expand the boundaries of the larger towns, the project area and the
surrounding area have remained primarily agricultural land characterized by small farms. Specific
results of the supplemental historical map and deed research are presented in Chapter 6.0 with
the discussions of each historic-age resource recorded during the survey.

From March 20 to 30, 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana Smith, with the
assistance of archeological technicians Jacob Lyons and Ben Johnson and under the overall
direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive survey of the project
area to locate any cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
Horizon’s archeologists traversed the project area on foot and thoroughly inspected the modern
ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources.
The vast majority of the project area is characterized by active agricultural fields that had
recently been planted for the season (Figures 5-1 to 5-2). While the majority of the project area
was dry, several poorly drained areas were observed in the northern portion of the project area
that retained pools of standing water from recent rains (Figure 5-3). Push piles of caliche and
other sediments and dozer cuts characterized small areas along the edges of fields in some areas
(Figure 5-4). Small copses of hackberry and cedar trees are scattered throughout the project
area; these are typically associated with historic-age standing structures on archeological sites.
The Clear Fork of Plum Creek and two of its tributaries flow eastward through the northern portion
of the project area, and unnamed tributaries of Hemphill Creek drain the southern portion of the
project area to the south. Typically, the ephemeral channels associated with these drainages
were dry at the time of the survey (Figure 5-5), though one poorly drained segment of the Clear
Fork of Plum Creek retained some water (Figure 5-6). Where present, erosional cutbank profiles
generally displayed a shallow to moderately deep plowzone overlying a thick B horizon (Figure 57), though caliche-rich subsoils were observed immediately below the plowzone in some areas
(Figure 5-8). While most portions of the project area exhibited clayey plowzone soils on the
modern ground surface, some portions of the project area had exposed caliche subsoils or dense
beds of chert-bearing limestone gravel on the surface (Figures 5-9 to 5-10). Two large stock
ponds or small, artificial lakes are present in the north-central portion of the project area north of
the only currently operating farm within the project area (recorded as site 41HY539) (Figures 511 to 5-12). Two main roads traverse the project area—FM 158 crosses the project area from
southwest to northeast, and a private gravel road crosses the project area between SH 21 on the
southeast and FM 158 on the northwest—and a number of ephemeral field roads skirt the edges
of the active fields. Visibility of the modern ground surface was characteristically excellent in the
agricultural fields (100%), though ground surface visibility in the small forested patches was
typically obscured by grasses and shrubs (<30%).

Chapter 5.0: Survey Methodology

In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 1.2 hectares (3.0 acres) within
project areas measuring more than 40.5 hectares (100.0 acres) in size. As such, 585 shovel tests
would be required within the 709.7-hectare (1,753.7-acre) project area. Horizon excavated a total
of 223 shovel tests during the survey (Figure 5-13). While the shovel testing density did not meet
the TSMASS requirements, the shovel testing regimen is considered to be more than adequate
to assess the subsurface cultural resources potential of the project area. The vast majority of the
project area consists of recently plowed fields, and visibility of the modern ground surface was
excellent across most of the project area, with the exception of a few isolated stands of vegetation.
As such, shovel testing was employed judgmentally to determine whether or not the potential
existed for intact archeological deposits to occur below the active plowzone, which averaged
approximately 30.0 to 35.0 centimeters (11.8 to 13.8 inches) in depth within the project area. The
majority of the cultural materials observed during the survey were constrained to the modern
ground surface, and all of the subsurface cultural materials observed were found within the
plowzone. As such, the shovel testing confirmed that all cultural materials within the project area
are confined to disturbed contexts on the modern ground surface and within the active plowzone.
All sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. The Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all shovel tests were determined using hand-held
Garmin ForeTrex Global Positioning System (GPS) devices based on the North American Datum
of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel testing was capable of fully penetrating sediments with the potential to
contain subsurface archeological deposits, and it is Horizon’s opinion that the pedestrian walkover
with surface inspection and judgmental shovel testing was adequate to evaluate the cultural
resources potential of the APE. Specific shovel test data for all 223 shovel tests excavated during
the survey are summarized in Appendix A.
Eleven newly recorded archeological sites were documented during the survey—
41HY536 to 41HY546. In the field, standard site recording forms were used to record pertinent
information on location, physiographic setting, and local environmental characteristics; types and
quantities of artifacts observed; distribution and densities of artifacts; artificial and natural impacts;
and the condition of surface and subsurface archeological deposits. Scaled sketch maps were
drawn that illustrated site boundaries; locations of shovel tests, cultural features, and/or material
concentrations; as well as notable features of the landscape. The sites were thoroughly photodocumented using color digital photography, and photographic logs were maintained of all
photographs taken. Based on the information recorded on the standard archeological site
recording forms in the field, Texas Archeological Data Site Update Forms were completed by
Horizon’s laboratory personnel using the most current version of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory’s (TARL) TexSite archeological data collection software, and the forms were
submitted to TARL to update the existing site files.
In addition, the mapped location of one previously recorded site located within the project
area, 41HY426, was revisited in an attempt to re-locate and re-investigate the site (see Figure 41). When it was originally recorded in 2006, this site consisted only of an ephemeral field scatter
of early 20th-century domestic debris, including two glass shards. Horizon inspected the modern
ground surface at the mapped site location and excavated several shovel tests in the surrounding
area. No cultural resources were observed at the mapped location of site 41HY426. The two

isolated artifacts that composed the site in 2006 have probably been reincorporated into the
plowzone. Site 41HY426 was previously determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP,
and no further archeological investigations are warranted on this site.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log
was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources. Diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No cultural resources were collected during the survey.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Eleven newly recorded archeological sites were documented during the survey—
41HY536 to 41HY546 (Figure 6-1). Nine of the 11 sites (41HY436 to 41HY543 and 41HY546)
consist of the remnants of early to mid-20th-century farmsteads and/or scatters of historic-age
domestic debris. Two of the 11 sites (41HY544 and 41HY545) consist exclusively of aboriginal
artifact scatters dated to unspecified prehistoric timeframes. Secondary cultural components
composed of sparse scatters of aboriginal artifacts were also observed on three of the nine
historic-age sites (41HY537, 41HY540, and 41HY543). Each site is described individually below.
The results of supplemental architectural evaluations and historical research on sites containing
standing architecture or remnants of standing structures (i.e., sites 41HY536 to 41HY543)
provided by Horizon’s architectural historian, Kathryn St. Clair, are included within the appropriate
site descriptions.

6.1

SITE 41HY536
General Description

Site 41HY536 represents the remnants of an early to mid-20th century farmstead located
off the northeastern side of an unnamed gravel road that provides access to several historic-age
farmsteads within the project area between SH 21 to the southeast and FM 158 to the northwest
(Figure 6-2; also see Figure 6-1). The site consists of a house, four barns, a metal windmill lattice
tower, a small well, two debris piles, and an associated surface and shallow subsurface scatter
of domestic debris. The site is situated on a rolling upland landform in a small copse of trees
surrounded by active agricultural fields. Vegetation on the site consists of post oak, sycamore,
and hackberry trees; poison ivy; dense grasses; and various weeds. Elevations on the site range
from 197.3 to 197.9 meters (647.0 to 649.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and historic-age debris, site 41HY536 measures
approximately 80.0 meters (262.4 feet) north to south by 85.0 meters (278.8 feet) east to west.
The delineated site boundaries are co-extensive with the grove of trees and vegetation within
which the site is situated. The site is bounded on its southwestern side by a private gravel road
and surrounded by agricultural fields.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

Cultural materials on site 41HY536 are largely constrained to the modern ground surface.
A total of six shovel tests were excavated on the site, one of which revealed shallow subsurface
cultural resources extending to a depth of 10.0 centimeters (3.9 inches) below surface.
Cultural Features Observed
Cultural features on site 41HY536 include a house (Structure W1-A), four barns
(Structures W1-B, W1-D, W1-E, and W1-F), a metal windmill lattice tower (Structure W1-C), a
small well, two debris piles, and an associated surface and shallow subsurface scatter of domestic
debris.

Structure W1-A—House (ca. 1910)
Structure W1-A is a one-story frame house with a rectangular footprint measuring
approximately 12.0 meters (39.4 feet) northeast to southwest by 10.0 meters (32.8 feet)
northwest to southeast (Figures 6-3 to 6-5). The house is sheltered with a pyramidal roof clad in
corrugated metal. A front hipped-porch roof extends over the two single-entry doors on the front
façade and over a small, concrete porch. The house is clad in ca. 1955 asbestos shingles.
Paired, wood-framed, one-over-one sash windows flank the front entrance. A brick chimney stack
rises from the center pitch of the roof. Exposed roof rafters under the eaves demonstrate
Craftsman stylistic influences, though the house is primarily modest in details and size. Wooden
posts (hewn cedar tree trunks) function as piers to support the sill plates and floor beams of the
house. The pyramidal, cottage-style house is in poor condition and is vacant. The house may

have served as a duplex. The house is equipped with relatively modern electrical and plumbing
fixtures. A small concrete well set flush with the ground is located a few meters southeast of the
house.

Structure W1-B—Northwestern Barn (ca. 1920)
Structure W1-B is a small barn located at the northwestern end of the site with a
rectangular footprint measuring approximately 8.0 meters (26.2 feet) square (Figures 6-6 to 6-7).
The barn is sheltered with an end-gabled roof. Clad in corrugated metal, the barn is constructed
of posts and beams and has a wooden plank floor and interior planked walls. A shed roof extends
over the southern side. The roof shelters an open bay, presumably an area that once housed
livestock. Hewn tree posts support the shed roof extension. A pile of concrete blocks is located
immediately northwest of the structure. Several pieces of furniture have been stored inside the
structure.

Structure W1-C—Windmill (ca. 1920)
Structure W1-C is a windmill mounted on a metal lattice tower with a metal ladder
extending to the top (Figure 6-8). The tower is secured on a concrete base. This structure is
located immediately southwest of the large central barn (Structure W1-D).

Structure W1-D—Central Barn (ca. 1920)
Structure W1-D is a large barn located in the approximate center of the site with a
rectangular footprint measuring approximately 15.0 meters northeast to southwest by 7.0 meters
northwest to southeast (Figures 6-9 to 6-12). The barn is sheltered with an end-gabled roof.
Corrugated metal clads the exterior walls and roof. The pole barn has an open bay on the
southeastern side and likely housed large equipment. Some of the poles are hewn tree trunks.
The building is in poor condition.

Structure W1-E—Eastern Barn (ca. 1920)
Structure W1-E is a small barn located at the eastern end of the site with a rectangular
footprint measuring approximately 7.0 meters (23.0 feet) northwest to southeast by 4.0 meters
(13.1 feet) northeast to southwest (Figures 6-13 to 6-15). The structure has an end-gabled roof.
Clad in corrugated metal, the barn is constructed with poles with the metal secured to the wood.
The southwestern side of the building is composed of two open bays. The barn once housed
chickens.

Structure W1-F—Northeastern Barn (ca. 1920)
Structure W1-F is a small wood pole barn located in the northeastern portion of the site
with a rectangular footprint measuring approximately 6.5 meters northeast to southwest by

4.5 meters northwest to southeast (Figures 6-16 to 6-17). Sheltered with an end-gabled roof, the
barn is clad in corrugated metal. Many of the structural poles are hewn cedar posts supporting
milled lumber horizontal bracing and roofing members (trusses and beams). The west side of the
barn has a partially open bay enclosed with chicken wire. The building was used as a large
chicken coop at one point.
Cultural Materials Observed
Cultural materials observed on site 41HY563 include whiteware and stoneware ceramic
sherds; amethyst, clear, aqua, brown, and olive green glass shards; a square nail; red cherry
bricks imprinted with “SEGUIN” maker’s marks; butchered faunal bone; and a vast array of
relatively modern domestic debris. The historic-age cultural materials on the site are generally
diagnostic of the early to mid-20th century.
Historical Research
The property on which site 41HY536 is located was owned by David William (D.W.) Crews
in 1912 prior to conveying the property to his son, Paul Crews, during that same year. D.W.
Crews owned numerous acres of land in Hays County during the late 19th and early
20th centuries. According to the Texas 1860 Slave Schedule, he owned one African-American
male, age 36. D.W. Crews is indicated as a farmer on the agricultural schedules of 1880. As a
side note, the Crews family name is spelled “Cruz” in the 1880 census, and “Crews” in following

census records. It is not known if he lived on this particular property during the ca.1910 to 1920
period of construction. Paul Crews (b. 1877, d. 1942) lived in Precinct 5 in 1900, 1910, and until
his death in 1942. His occupation in 1940 was “real estate” on the US census of 1940. This may
suggest that he purchased the property and rented it out to tenant farmers. The house may have
been constructed as a tenant house. The property was sold prior to 1952 to H.J. Wranitzky, and
it stayed in the Wranitzky family until Emil and Olga Ehrlich purchased the property in 1967. Henry
John (H.J.) Wranitzky arrived from Austria in 1889 with his parents. In the early 1900s, H.J.
Wranitzsky purchased a blacksmith shop in Uhland (Stovall et al. 1986). In 1995, the Ehrlichs
sold the property to the Warhmund family members, who eventually would own all of the
properties within the project area. The property stayed under the ownership of the Warhmund
family prior to the sale to investment bankers and developers in 2005.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41HY536 represents the remnants of an early to mid-20th century farmstead
consisting of a house, four barns, a metal windmill lattice tower, a small well, two debris piles, and
an associated surface and shallow subsurface scatter of domestic debris. The structures on the
site were constructed between ca. 1910 and 1920, and the cultural materials on the site suggest
an occupation spanning the early to mid-20th centuries. Judging from the large quantities of
modern debris stored within the buildings, it is possible the occupation extended into the late
20th century, though it is also possible the buildings have been used for storage by the occupants
of another nearby farmstead to the northwest (site 41HY539).

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

The small farm complex is associated with the early agricultural development and German
settlement in Hays County near the Pecan Springs community or the Plum Creek valley. The
house, associated barns, windmill, and surrounding farmland are associated with this period in
history and could be considered significant under Criterion A. However, the main house and
barns lack integrity of design, workmanship, materials, and feeling in order to convey this
significance.
The Crews, Ehrlich, and Warhmund families do not appear in any of the previous surveys,
prepared historic contexts, online searches, or in Stovall et al. (1986). The property is not known
to be associated with an important person or family; therefore, it is not significant under
Criterion B.
Structure W1-A is an early 20th-century pyramidal cottage typically found on farms and
ranches of this region. The house may have served as a tenant farmer dwelling or as the domicile
of the family that owned the property over the years. Overall, the house is not constructed in a
particularly unique or distinct architectural style or design. It is in poor condition and no longer
conveys architecturally or stylistically significant features. The original form of the house is not
evident due to its poor condition. The barns do not have a unique design and do not embody
distinct characteristics of a particular style. Structures W1-B, W1-D, W1-E, and W1-F (i.e., the
barns) are considered not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion C. Structure W1-C
(i.e., the windmill) is also not considered a unique design and is considered not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion C. The integrity of workmanship, design, materials, and
feeling are compromised by the poor condition of the house and barns, and the buildings no longer
convey a historic sense of an early 20th-century farm complex. The resources do appear to be
in the original location. The house and associated barns and windmill are recommended as not
eligible for listing on the NRHP under Criterion C.
The main house does not embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method
of construction; does not represent the work of a master; and does not possess high artistic
values. Therefore, the property is not significant under Criterion C. Due to a lack of historic
integrity, the property is considered not eligible for listing on the NRHP. The resources are not
considered historically significant under Criteria A, B, or C. Therefore, the resources individually
or as a ranch complex are recommended as not eligible for listing on the NHRP. Furthermore,
while there is an abundance of domestic debris on the site, the cultural materials do not possess
any special capacity to contribute meaningfully to knowledge of the historical past. As such, the
site is not considered significant under Criterion D. Site 41HY536 is recommended as not eligible
for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or for inclusion in the NRHP.

SITE 41HY537
General Description

Site 41HY537 is a multiple-component site consisting of the remnants of an early to mid20th-century farmstead and a low-density scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage of unknown date
located off the northwestern side of FM 158 (Figure 6-18; also see Figure 6-1). The remains of a

metal silo, are located southeast of the site closer to the road. The site is situated on a rolling
upland landform in a small copse of trees surrounded by active agricultural fields. Vegetation on
the site consists of post oak and hackberry trees and various shrubs, weeds, and ankle- to kneehigh grasses. Elevations on the site are relatively flat, ranging only from approximately 199.4 to
200.0 meters (654.0 to 656.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and historic-age debris, site 41HY537 measures
approximately 52.0 meters (170.6 feet) northeast to southwest by 34.0 meters (111.5 feet)
northwest to southeast.
Cultural materials on site 41HY537 are largely constrained to the modern ground surface,
though three of the six shovel tests excavated on the site revealed shallow subsurface
archeological deposits extending to depths of 10.0 to 15.0 centimeters (3.9 to 5.9 inches) below
surface.
Cultural Features Observed
The only extant cultural feature observed on site 41HY537 is a house (Structure W2). The
two modern metal buildings adjacent to FM 158 were not included in the site boundaries. No
aboriginal cultural features were observed on the site.

Structure W2—House (ca. 1925)
Structure W2 is a one-story house with a rectangular footprint measuring approximately
12.0 meters (39.4 feet) northeast to southwest by 8.0 meters (26.2 feet) northwest to southeast
(Figures 6-19 to 6-25). Constructed with hollow-clay tiles clad in stucco, the house dates from
ca. 1925. A front-gable roof with a planked, wood-clad gable shelters the house. The roof eaves
extend over exposed wood rafters. A brick chimney extends from the northern slope of the roof,
near the center of the house. Two-over-two aluminum sash window configurations are found on
the northern and southern sides along with older one-over-one configurations. A collapsed shedroof porch extends from the front façade. The chimney has stove-pipe connections in two rooms
of the house.
Cultural Materials Observed
Historic-age cultural materials observed on site 41HY537 include clear, blue, amethyst,
aqua, milk, amber, and green glass shards; a porcelain door handle fragment; plain and transferprinted whiteware ceramic sherds; one square nail; and various unidentified metal fragments
(Figure 6-26). The historic-age materials are generally diagnostic of an early to mid-20th-century
occupation. Aboriginal cultural resources observed on the site consist of one late-stage biface
preform and a piece of lithic debitage, both of which were manufactured from gray Edwards
Formation chert (Figure 6-27). Due to the lack of temporally diagnostic aboriginal artifacts, the
aboriginal occupation of the site can only be dated to an unspecified prehistoric timeframe.

Historical Research
In the mid-1920s, hollow tiles were promoted as building materials by trade organizations
and magazines as fireproof, vermin-proof, good insulating material that would not deteriorate
(Hollow Building Tile Association 1925). The hollow building tile was described as a:
[H]ard burned clay product, made in various sizes, and having one or more voids running
longitudinally through it. It is made of surface clay, or fire clay, which is finely ground,
mixed with water into a plastic mass and forced through dies. It is then fired at
2,000 degrees (Hollow Building Tile Association 1925).

Organizations encouraged the use of stucco as cladding over the tile. Tile manufactures
highlighted the stable properties of the tile, which were thought to eliminate the risk of stucco
chipping or flaking off. Stucco was advertised as easy to apply and customize with different colors
(Hollow Building Tile Association 1925). The D’Hanis Brick and Tile Company, founded in 1883
(and still in operation through the 1980s) produced hollow clay building tiles (Odintz 2017). The
D’Hanis Brick and Tile Company was located in a small community near San Antonio. The
remains of a house built with the same tile and with brick from the D’Hanis Brick and Tile Company
is found on site 41HY542. The building tiles for the house on site 41HY537 may have also been
shipped (via railroad) from the D’Hanis company.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

Historically, sites 41HY536, 41HY538, and 41HY540 were part of the property on which
site 41HY537 is located. Site 41HY538 includes a ca.1890 well, site 41HY540 includes another
ca.1930 house (now collapsed) constructed using a similar method as the house on site
41HY537, and site 41HY536 has a ca.1910 house and barn. Based on the estimated date of the
well on site 41HY538 (possibly as early as the late 19th or early 20th centuries), this larger
property may have had earlier structures associated with farming that are no longer extant. Many
of the farms in this area were occupied by tenant farmers. The houses on sites 41HY537 and
41HY540 may have been constructed as tenant farmer houses, with a larger, earlier primary
farmhouse now gone. The lack of stylistic details, the modest size, and the use of somewhat
utilitarian materials suggest that the house on site 41HY537 was constructed for functionality.
The house loosely resembles a bungalow form, though it does not exhibit characteristics of a
particular style. It is in poor condition.
The property on which site 41HY537 is located was owned by David William (D.W.) Crews
in 1912 prior to conveying the property to his son, Frank Crews, during that same year. Prior to
this time period, the Crews family (wife Ann and their 10 children) lived in Hays County Precinct 2
according to the US census of 1880. D.W. Crews owned numerous acres of land in Hays County
during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. D.W. Crews is indicated as a farmer on the
agricultural schedules of 1880. It is not known if he ever lived on this particular property. Frank
Crews (b. 1878, d. 1945) lived in Buda in 1920 according to US census records of 1920. Frank
Crews is listed on the World War I draft registration (1917-1918) as a farmer and a resident of
Buda. In 1927, Frank and his wife Lena sold the property to R.H. Kretzmeier. When the
Kretzmeier’s sold the land in 1948, there is mention of tenants on the premises (Hays County
Deed, v. 148, p. 352). In the late 1950s and 1960s, the property was sold to Dr. M.D. Heatly, who
owned quite a bit of property in the county, and to Alex Kercheville. The property eventually
ended up with the Warhmund family prior to the sale to investment bankers and developers in
2005.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41HY537 is a multiple-component site consisting of the remnants of an early to mid20th-century farmstead and a low-density scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage of unknown date.
The historic-age component consists of a farmhouse constructed around 1925 and an associated
scatter of 20th-century domestic debris. The aboriginal component consists of one late-stage
biface preform and a piece of lithic debitage.
The small house (Structure W2) is associated with agricultural development in eastern
Hays County near the Pecan Springs community or the Plum Creek valley. The house and
surrounding agricultural fields are associated with this period in history and could be considered
significant under Criterion A. However, the house lacks integrity of design, workmanship,
materials, and feeling in order to convey this significance. The property likely included additional
historic-age structures at one time. The Crews, Heatly, Kretzmeier, and Warhmund families do
not appear in any of the previous surveys, prepared historic contexts, online searches, or in
Stovall et al. (1986). The property is not known to be associated with an important person or
family; therefore, it is not significant under Criterion B. The house does not embody distinctive

characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction. It does not represent the work of a
master and does not possess high artistic values. Therefore the property is not significant under
Criterion C. Due to a lack of historic integrity, the property is considered not eligible for listing on
the NRHP. Furthermore, the ephemeral archeological deposits associated with both the historicage and aboriginal components are constrained to the modern ground surface and shallow
subsurface deposits. The archeological deposits are disturbed, lack integrity, and possess
minimal potential to contribute to knowledge of the historic or prehistoric past. As such, the site
is not considered significant under Criterion D. Site 41HY537 is recommended as not eligible for
designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the NRHP.

6.3

SITE 41HY538
General Description

Site 41HY538 consists of a late 19th to early 20th-century well, a debris pile, and a
surrounding scatter of early to mid-20th-century domestic debris located off the northwestern side
of FM 158 (Figures 6-28 to 6-29; also see Figure 6-1). No standing structures or other cultural
features are present on the site. The site is situated on a rolling upland landform in a small copse
of trees surrounded by active agricultural fields. Vegetation on the site consists of small saplings
and various weeds. Elevations on the site are relatively flat, ranging only from 200.3 to
200.9 meters (657.0 to 659.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and historic-age debris, site 41HY538 measures
approximately 35.0 meters (114.8 feet) in diameter.
Cultural materials on site 41HY538 are largely constrained to the modern ground surface,
though four of the six shovel tests excavated on the site revealed shallow subsurface
archeological deposits extending to depths of 5.0 to 20.0 centimeters (2.0 to 7.9 inches) below
surface.
Cultural Features Observed
Two cultural features were observed on site 41HY538, a brick-and-limestone well and a
pile of cut limestone rubble.
The brick-and-limestone well is located roughly in the center of the site and measures
1.6 meters (5.2 feet) in diameter (Figures 6-30 to 6-31). The well is constructed from cut
limestone blocks, and the top is lined with red cherry bricks. A small portion of the rim of the well
projects above the modern ground surface to a height of approximately 0.3 meter (1.0 feet),
though the rest of the well is set flush with the ground. The well may date from the late 19th century
or early 20th centuries.
The debris pile is composed of cut limestone blocks, concrete chunks, bricks, and metal
debris (see Figure 6-32). The rubble pile may represent the remnants of a historic-age structure
based on the presence of metal hardware and other construction materials among the associated

artifact scatter surrounding the feature, though the function of this structure is unknown. It may
also simply represent unused cut limestone blocks left over from the construction of the well.
Cultural Materials Observed
Cultural materials observed on site 41HY538 include blue, aqua, amethyst, rose, amber,
milk, and clear glass shards; two clear glass bottle fragments; one porcelain door handle; one
metal belt buckle; one metal door or window hinge; various pieces of unidentified metal debris;
and red cherry bricks stamped with “D’HANIS” maker’s marks (Figures 6-33 to 6-34). The historicage cultural materials are generally diagnostic of an early to mid-20th-century occupation.
Historical Research
Hays County Tax Appraisal District information indicates that there was a house dating
from 1890 on the parcel on which site 41HY538 is located. This house, or the remains of the
house, were not identified during field investigations, though the presence of a well and a
moderately dense scatter of domestic debris on the site attests to the presence of a historic-age
occupation. The well is no longer associated with a contemporary domestic structure.
Historically, sites 41HY536, 41HY537, and 41HY540 were part of the property on which site
41HY538 is located. Site 41HY537 includes a ca.1930 house, and site 41HY540 includes another
cs.1930 house (now collapsed) constructed in a similar method as the house on site 41HY537.
These houses may have been constructed as tenant farmer houses, with a larger, earlier primary

farmhouse now gone. Based on the estimated date of the well on site 41HY538 (possibly as early
as the late 19th or early 20th centuries), this larger property may have had earlier structures
associated with farming that are no longer extant. The chain-of-title for this property is the same
as that discussed above for site 41HY537.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41HY538 consists of a late 19th to early 20th-century well, a debris pile, and a
surrounding scatter of early to mid-20th-century domestic debris. Tax records indicate that there
was a house standing on this parcel in 1890, though this structure is no longer present. Based
on the small size of the site, it is likely that the house stood near to the well, and the rubble pile
adjacent to the well may represent the former location of this structure.
The well is associated with early agricultural development and German settlement in Hays
County near the Pecan Springs community or the Plum Creek valley. The well and surrounding
pasture land are associated with this period in history and could be considered significant under
Criterion A. However, the well lacks integrity of feeling, association, and setting. The lack of
primary buildings, including a farmhouse of similar construction period and a farm complex,
diminishes the historical significance and context of the well. Though the materials and design of
the well are largely intact, the well is not considered significant under Criterion C. The property
likely included additional historic-age structures at one time. The Crews, Heatly, Kretzmeier and

important person or family; therefore, it is not significant under Criterion B. The well does not
embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; does not represent
the work of a master and does not possess high artistic values. Therefore the property is not
significant under Criterion C. Due to a lack of historic integrity, the property is considered not
eligible for listing on the NRHP. Furthermore, the ephemeral archeological deposits are
constrained to the modern ground surface and shallow subsurface deposits. The archeological
deposits are disturbed, lack integrity, and possess minimal potential to contribute to knowledge
of the historic or prehistoric past. As such, the site is not considered significant under Criterion D.
Site 41HY538 is recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the
NRHP.

6.4

SITE 41HY539
General Description

Site 41HY539 consists of an early to mid-20th-century farmstead with some additional
modern buildings located off of either side of an unnamed gravel road that provides access to
several historic-age farmsteads within the project area between SH 21 to the southeast and
FM 158 to the northwest (Figure 6-35; also see Figure 6-1). Historic-age structures on the site
include an early to mid-20th-century house, two barns, a concrete well, and a concrete animal
trough. Several modern buildings also have been constructed on the site, including two barns
and six metal storage silos. Two large stock ponds or small lakes are present to the northeast of
the farm complex in a lightly wooded area on the other side of the gravel road. The site is currently
occupied by tenant farmers and is in use as an active farm complex. The site is located on a
rolling upland landform overlooking the channel of the Clear Fork of Plum Creek to the north.
Vegetation immediately surrounding the structures on the site consists mainly of post oak,
hackberry, and various sapling trees as well as short, dense grasses and weeds. Vegetation
surrounding the stock ponds or lakes northeast of the gravel road is much denser. To the
southwest of the site are open, plowed fields. Elevations on the site range from 196.6 to
199.4 meters (645.0 to 654.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of standing structures, cultural features, and associated historic-age
debris, site 41HY539 measures approximately 405.0 meters (1,328.4 feet) northwest to southeast
by 56.0 meters (183.7 feet) northeast to southwest.
Cultural materials on site 41HY536 are constrained to the modern ground surface. No
subsurface cultural materials were observed in any of the 10 shovel tests excavated on the site.
Cultural Features Observed
Cultural features on site 41HY539 include an early to mid-20th-century house
(Structure W4-A), two contemporary historic-age barns (Structures W4-B and W4-C), a concrete

well, and a concrete animal trough. Several modern structures, including two barns and six
storage silos, are also present on the site. A gravel road bisects the site. The farm complex is
currently in operation.

Structure W4-A—House (ca. 1925)
Structure W4-A is a one-story bungalow with a slight “L” footprint measuring approximately
24.0 meters (78.7 feet) northeast to southwest by 9.0 meters (29.6 feet) northwest to southeast
(Figures 6-36 to 6-39). The house has a rear double-garage addition. The front-gabled roof
overhangs the exterior walls to form deep eaves supported with L brackets. Exposed rafter tails
emerge from the eaves on the slope sides of the house. The frame house is clad in what appear
to be asbestos shingles. An enclosed front porch is positioned on the front of the house. The
front door is off-center between two four-over-four wood-framed sash windows. Windows of the
same configuration are found on the northwestern and southwestern sides of the house. The
L extends from the southeastern side of the house and may be an addition. A standing-seam
metal roof shelters the house. A chimney pipe extends from the center of the ridgeline. Form
stone is applied to the base of the house to provide an exaggerated foundation skirt for the pierand-beam foundation.
The bungalow exhibits some characteristics of the Craftsman style, including the
bracketed eaves and exposed rafter tails. This style, and the bungalow form, were widely popular
from 1910 to the 1930s. The form, typically with two bedrooms, a bathroom, kitchen, and living
space, was efficient to construct and easy to apply architectural details to, particularly in the
Craftsman stylistic details, which were easily accessible to rural communities during this time due
to the proximity to the railroad. Common features of these early bungalows include a strong
horizontal emphasis with low-pitched roofs, extended eaves, and broadly proportioned openings.
The porch is a critical design element and a visually dominant feature. It is often partially inset
and typically has tapered or canted supports with broad bases that suggest weight and mass to
both the porch and the structure. Although they display many of the essential components seen
on earlier versions, bungalows built after 1920 often are less grand in scale, detailing, and level
of craftsmanship, which made them more affordable to the growing numbers of middle-income
families. Ornate woodwork was seen less often and windows typically were grouped in pairs and
had one-over-one light sashes without the geometric designs frequently seen on pre-1920
bungalows. Tapered box columns, triangular knee brackets in gable ends, and extended eaves
with exposed rafter ends are common features of post-1920 bungalows. A total of 287 bungalows
were recorded in Hays County in Myers (2004).
Of the popular plan types built throughout the nation in the early 20th century, the
bungalow was the most significant and common. They appeared in the first decade of the
20th century, reaching a peak of popularity between 1910 and 1930 when they were featured in
literature and magazines devoted exclusively to the house type. Typical bungalow features
include a low-slung profile of only one or 1-1/2 stories and a broad roofline that incorporates the
porch or veranda in an attempt to minimize the contrast between exterior and interior space.
Bungalow designs typically feature angular brackets supporting widely spreading and often

decoratively carved eaves. The roof form most often identified with bungalows is a multiplegabled roof (Myers 2004).
Bungalows are found throughout rural Hays County in both the small towns and as ranch
or farmhouses. Bungalows are the most common subtype of domestic building in Hays County.
Because they are so prevalent, bungalows are found throughout the county in varying stages of
integrity and condition. They were built locally from the 1910s until the 1930s. Their dominance
reflects the bungalow's popularity and the county's general prosperity when most citizens
benefited from the high yields of local cotton growers.
The most common form of bungalow in Hays County is the front-gabled bungalow. A
smaller, secondary front gable often covers a partially inset porch. Side-gabled bungalows,
likewise, have a single-gabled roof with slopes on the front and rear elevations, while the gable
ends are on the side. Porches on earlier versions of this subgroup are completely inset, but more
recent ones have small porches that only cover the main entrance. Cross-gabled bungalows
have a front-facing gable and another gable that intersects at a right angle. Often, this second
gable is located on the front and incorporates the porch, giving the structure a more horizontal
emphasis (Myers 2004).

Structure W4-B—Barn (ca. 1925)
Structure W4-B is a small barn in the central portion of the site with a rectangular footprint
measuring approximately 5.0 meters (16.4 feet) northeast to southwest by 6.5 meters (21.3 feet)
northwest to southeast (Figures 6-40 to 6-41). This structure has an end-gabled roof. Rafter tails

are exposed under the roof eaves. Corrugated metal siding clads the barn. Two single-entry
doors are found on the barn, one on the northeastern side and one on the southwestern side
(both on the long or slope sides of the barn). The doors are also enclosed in the metal sheeting.
Relatively small in size, the barn may have housed equipment, livestock feed, or possibly
chickens.

Structure W4-C—Livestock Barn (ca. 1925)
Structure W4-C is a livestock barn located at the eastern end of the site with a rectangular
footprint measuring approximately 15.0 meters (49.2 feet) northwest to southeast by 7.0 meters
(23.0 feet) northeast to southwest with an end-gabled roof (Figure 6-42 to 6-43). The pole barn
is constructed of cedar posts supporting the roof and multiple open bays that face southwest. The
barn is clad in corrugated metal and is in very poor condition. This barn is located across the
gravel road from the historic-age house on the site (Structure W4-A), though historically the
structures were all a part of the same property. The barn is currently on the same legal parcel as
site 41HY536, though historically sites 41HY536 to 41HY540 and 41HY542 were all part of the
same parcel as early as 1912 (Hays County Deed Records, Vol. 61, page 577).

Concrete Well
A concrete well is located about 10.0 meters (32.8 feet) west-southwest of the larger barn
(Structure W4-C) (Figure 6-44). The well measures approximately 1.8 meters (6.0 feet) across.

Modern Facilities
Site 41HY539 also contains two modern steel barns and six metal storage silos (Figure 646). The farm is currently utilized by tenant farmers and is the only farmstead within the project
area currently in use.

this time-period, the Crews family (wife Ann and their 10 children) lived in Hays County Precinct 2
according to the US census of 1880. D.W. Crews owned numerous acres of land in Hays County
during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. D.W. Crews is indicated as a farmer on the
agricultural schedules of 1880. It is not known if he ever lived on this particular property. Samuel
Crews is listed on the World War I draft registration (1917 to 1918) as a farmer and a resident of
Precinct 2 in Hays County. By 1934, the property was sold to J.M. Young, who later sold the
property to Aubra Young and later Edward Young (Aubra’s son). Aubra Young is listed on the
1940 census for Precinct 2 as a farmer who owns his own land with a home valued at $1,500. By
1942, he and his wife Alice lived in San Marcos, though he worked in Kyle according to US World
War II draft registration cards. David A. Young was one of Kyle’s first grocers, having opened a
mercantile store after the railroad was established (Myers 2004). It has not been confirmed that
J.M, Aubra and David Young are related, but is a high likelihood. The property eventually ended
up with the Warhmund family (in 1983) prior to the sale to investment bankers and developers in
2005.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41HY539 consists of an early to mid-20th-century farmstead with some additional
modern buildings. Historic-age structures on the site include an early to mid-20th-century house,
two barns, a concrete well, and a concrete animal trough. Several modern buildings also have
been constructed on the site, including two barns and six metal storage silos. Two large stock
ponds or small lakes are present to the northeast of the farm complex in a lightly wooded area on
the other side of the gravel road. The site is currently occupied by tenant farmers and is in use
as an active farm complex.
The bungalow on site 41HY539 is associated with early agricultural development and
German settlement in Hays County near the Pecan Springs community or the Plum Creek valley.
The house, associated barns, and surrounding pasture land are associated with this period in
history and could be considered significant under Criterion A. However, the main house lacks
integrity of design, workmanship, materials, and feeling in order to convey this significance. The
property likely included additional historic-age structures at one time. The Crews and Warhmund
families do not appear in any of the previous surveys, prepared historic contexts, online searches,
or in Stovall et al. (1986). The Young family is associated with the first grocery store, though the
founder, David Young, is far removed from the time period of construction; therefore, the
association with this person is minimal. The property is not known to be associated with an
important person or family; therefore, it is not significant under Criterion B. The house or barns
do not embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; do not
represent the work of a master; and do not possess high artistic values. Therefore the property
is not significant under Criterion C. Due to a lack of historic integrity, the property is considered
not eligible for listing on the NRHP.

SITE 41HY540
General Description

Site 41HY540 is a multiple-component site consisting of the remnants of a collapsed early
to mid-20th-century farmhouse with an associated scatter of historic-age domestic debris and a
sparse aboriginal component consisting of a low-density scatter of lithic artifacts (Figure 6-47;
also see Figure 6-1). The farmhouse has almost completely collapsed and currently consists of
a standing brick-and-mortar chimney on a concrete foundation covered in the collapsed remnants
of the structure that once stood there (Figure 6-48). The site is situated on a rolling upland
landform overlooking an unnamed tributary of the Clear Fork of Plum Creek. This intermittent
tributary flows southeastward to the northeast of the site and lies between the site and the nearest
road, FM 158, to the northeast, and it is not currently apparent how this site was accessed
historically. A small clump of hackberry trees forms a backdrop to the standing chimney, but
vegetation on the site is otherwise largely absent. The site is surrounded by active agricultural
fields. Elevations on the site are relatively flat, averaging approximately 201.8 meters (662.0 feet)
amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and historic-age and aboriginal debris, site
41HY540 measures approximately 60.0 meters (196.8 feet) in diameter.
Cultural materials on site 41HY540 are largely constrained to the modern ground surface,
though three of the six shovel tests revealed shallow subsurface archeological deposits extending
to a depth of 10.0 centimeters (3.9 inches) below surface.
Cultural Features Observed
The remnants of one cultural feature, a concrete foundation supporting a pile of clay tile
and mortar rubble and a standing brick-and-mortar chimney, are present on site 41HY540
(Figures 6-49 to 6-52). The concrete foundation slab measures approximately 12.0 meters
(39.4 feet) northeast to southwest by 7.0 meters (23.0 feet) northwest to southeast. The former
house was constructed of hollow clay tile, though the structure has almost completely collapsed.
Only the concrete foundation pad and brick chimney remain, and construction materials are
scattered around the site. The former house had a square or almost square foundation. The
hollow tiles are the same as those found on site 41HY537 (see the site description for site
41HY537 for information about the hollow clay tile building material). Both properties were owned
by the same person as far back as 1912 (Hays County Deed Records, Volume 61, page 577).
No other associated historic-age features were identified near this house ruin.
Cultural Materials Observed
Historic-age cultural materials observed on site 41HY540 include amethyst, clear, aqua,
olive green, amber, and milk glass shards; one porcelain door knob; plain and decorated
whiteware ceramic sherds; tile fragments; a stoneware insulator; and unidentified metal fragments
(Figure 6-53 to 6-54). Historic-age artifacts are generally diagnostic of an early to mid-20th78

century occupation. Aboriginal cultural resources observed on the site consist of one late-stage
biface preform, a tested chert cobble, a few small chert cores, and several primary flakes
(Figure 6-55). No temporally diagnostic aboriginal artifacts were observed, and the aboriginal
occupation of the site can only be dated to an unspecified prehistoric timeframe.
Historical Research
The property on which site 41HY540 is located was owned by David William (D.W.) Crews
in 1912 prior to conveying the property to his son, Frank Crews, during that same year. Prior to
this time period, the Crews family (wife Ann and their 10 children) lived in Hays County Precinct 2
according to the US Census of 1880. As a side note, the Crews family name is spelled “Cruz” in
the 1880 census and “Crews” in following census records. D.W. Crews owned numerous acres
of land in Hays County during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. D.W. Crews is indicated as
a farmer on the agricultural schedules of 1880. It is not known if he ever lived on this particular
property. Frank Crews (b. 1878, d. 1945) lived in Buda in 1920 according to US census records
of 1920. Frank Crews is listed on the World War I draft registration (1917-1918) as a farmer and
a resident of Buda. In 1927, Frank and his wife Lena sold the property to R.H. Kretzmeier. In the
late 1950s and 1960s, the property was sold to Dr. M.D. Heatly, who owned quite a bit of property
in the county, and to Alex Kercheville. The property eventually ended up with the Warhmund
family prior to the sale to investment bankers and developers in 2005.

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41HY540 is a multiple-component site consisting of the remnants of a collapsed early
to mid-20th-century farmhouse with an associated scatter of historic-age domestic debris and a
sparse aboriginal component consisting of a low-density scatter of temporally non-diagnostic lithic
artifacts. The farmhouse has almost completely collapsed and currently consists of a standing
brick-and-mortar chimney on a concrete foundation covered in the collapsed remnants of the
structure that once stood there.
The domestic structure ruin on site 41HY540 is associated with the early agricultural
development and German settlement in Hays County near the Pecan Springs community or the
Plum Creek valley. The house and surrounding plowed agricultural field are associated with this
period in history and could be considered significant under Criterion A. However, the structure
lacks integrity of design, workmanship, materials, association, and feeling in order to convey this
significance. The property likely included additional historic-age structures at one time. The
Crews, Heatly, Kretzmeier and Warhmund families do not appear in any of the previous surveys,
prepared historic contexts, online searches, or in Stovall et al. (1986). The property is not known
to be associated with an important person or family; therefore, it is not significant under
Criterion B. The collapsed structure does not embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period,
or method of construction; does not represent the work of a master; and does not possess high
artistic values. Therefore the property is not significant under Criterion C. Due to a lack of historic

integrity, the property is considered not eligible for listing on the NRHP. Furthermore, the
ephemeral archeological deposits associated with both the historic-age and aboriginal
components are constrained to the modern ground surface and shallow subsurface deposits. The
archeological deposits are disturbed, lack integrity, and possess minimal potential to contribute
to knowledge of the historic or prehistoric past. As such, the site is not considered significant
under Criterion D. Site 41HY540 is recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL or for
inclusion in the NRHP.

6.6

SITE 41HY541
General Description

Site 41HY541 represents the remnants of an early to mid-20th-century farmstead located
off the southwestern side of FM 158 (Figure 6-56; also see Figure 6-1). The site is accessed via
a gravel driveway from FM 158 constructed atop an elevated earthen berm. The site consists of
the remnants of a somewhat unusual brick house, a barn, a concrete well, and a collapsed shed.
A gravel drive leads from FM 158 to the northeast onto the property and towards the original front
of the house. The site is situated on a rolling upland overlooking the headwaters of an intermittent
tributary of the Clear Fork of Plum Creek that arises to the southeast of the site. The site is located
in a copse of trees surrounded by plowed fields. Vegetation on the site consists of post oak, elm,
hackberry, and sycamore trees, various grasses, and weeds. Elevations on the site are relatively
flat, ranging only from approximately 205.5 to 206.1 meters (674.0 to 676.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and historic-age debris, site 41HY541 measures
approximately 78.0 meters (255.8 feet) northwest to southeast by 52.0 meters (170.6 feet)
northeast to southwest. The site boundaries are largely co-extensive with the little copse of trees
within which the historic-age structures are situated.
Cultural materials on site 41HY541 are constrained largely to the modern ground surface,
though one of the six shovel tests excavated on the site contained shallow subsurface
archeological deposits extending to a depth of 10.0 centimeters (3.9 inches) below surface.
Cultural Features Observed
Cultural features on site 41HY541 include the remnants of a brick house (Structure W6A), a collapsed shed (Structure W6-B), a barn (Structure W6-C), and a concrete well.

Structure W6-A—House (ca. 1900)
Structure W6-A is a front-facing, L-plan house constructed of buff-colored brick coursed
in a common bond pattern (Figures 6-57 to 6-64). The house appears to have had a single story,
with a partial basement under the L portion (i.e., the southeastern section). Stone steps lead
down into the basement level from the exterior. The window and door openings feature rough
brick arches formed with two courses of header bricks above transom window openings. Header
course bricks form window sills. The interior walls of the building once had stucco coating

(possibly the exterior as well). A water table extends approximately 0.9 meter (3.0 feet) up from
ground level. The building is supported on rough-cut sandstone blocks, limestone rubble, and
bricks. A kitchen addition (presumably) once extended from the southwestern side of the building.
This addition appears to have been a frame construction with a concrete slab foundation and a
wood floor supported on wood beams. Gas and water pipes extend from the slab. A front porch
inset within the L faced FM 158 and the driveway leading up to the house, though the porch
burned down along with the rest of the interior of the structure several years ago.
The remaining walls are approximately 30.5 centimeters (12.0 inches) thick, with 40.6centimeter- (16.0-inch-) thick basement or foundation walls. An additional concrete slab is found
off the southeastern end of the house. This may have been a bathroom addition based on the
presence of water pipes extending from the slab. A newer brick addition was constructed off the
northeastern (front) side of the house. This addition may have been a reconstructed porch floor,
though the steps into the basement are located in this area also. The house had large wooden
floor beams extending from voids within the brick walls (almost all of the wood members are
burned out, along with all windows, doors, and interior walls). Small, brick-arched openings
located near the foundation provided light into the basement level. The roof type is undetermined
based on the lack of remaining roofing materials. It may have had a cross-gable roof or hipped
roof clad in corrugated metal. The house may also have had some Folk Victorian or Queen Anne
details in the woodwork. The windows were likely a two-over-two wood sash configuration. Any
evidence of a fireplace or chimney is gone.
The L-plan dwelling, Texas' most common late-19th-century house form, is probably an
elaboration of the center-passage house. The most common examples of L-plan houses are one
or one-and-a-half stories in height, although two-story versions exist, especially in main areas. Lplan houses characteristically have cross-gable or intersecting roofs with an off-center gabled
wing extending forward and another one to the rear. Wood-frame construction is typical and
weatherboard siding is often used to sheath the exterior, but masonry dwellings of this type are
found as well, most often in cities. Because most were built during the late 19th century, L-plan
dwellings often display the elaborate detailing and ornamentation, particularly on porches and on
gable ends, that was widely popular at that time. Entry is made into the central hallway or
passage, and the interior arrangement follows the basic plan of the center-passage house.
Access to the projecting rooms extends from within one of the main rooms off the central hall.
The projecting wing can be divided into two rooms, of which the front room is the most important
public space. The two areas can be paired, if necessary, to form a circuit of entertaining spaces.
The remaining room functions as a private chamber (Myers 2004).
L-plan houses are the most common vernacular plan type found in Hays County and are
common in both rural and urban settings. Surveys conducted in 1995 and 1996 identified 74 Lplan houses in rural Hays County. They were common in the country, serving as primary farm
and ranch houses, as well as in the county's small towns like Dripping Springs, Buda, and Kyle.
Many others are in the city of San Marcos. Although they were built from the late 1870s until
about 1910, most local examples date to the last two decades of the 19th century and are one or
one-and-a-half stories in height. Wood-frame construction with weatherboard siding prevails,
although many houses are now covered with synthetic siding. The majority display modest

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

detailing and textural variety that are characteristic of the Queen Anne style, and these features
often are seen on the porch and on the gable ends. Porch supports, for example, frequently have
turned-wood supports, jig-sawn brackets, and spindled friezes. The gable ends typically feature
pent roofs and wood-shingled siding in contrasting patterns, occasionally with jig-sawn
bargeboards in the apex of gable ends. Doors typically have single light transoms (Myers 2004).
Structure W6-A is unusual in its style (primarily in terms of the window and door openings)
and materials for the area. Rural farmhouses in eastern Hays County were typically of frame
construction, not masonry. Early rural masonry farmhouses were more often constructed of
stone, not brick. The arched window and door openings give the building a commercial and/or
urban feel. The construction of such a house on a rural property suggests that the house may
have had a public use, such as a farm office or meeting space, though it’s most recent use does
appear to have been as a residence based on the amount of furniture and domestic debris
scattered around the site. The building seems a bit out of place for a domestic structure, though
no documentation or resources suggest an alternate use.

Structure W6-B—Collapsed Shed (ca. 1950)
Resource W6-B is a collapsed frame shed that was once sheltered within a corrugated
metal roof (Figure 6-65 to 6-66). Wood planking composed the walls, though the form is
undetermined due to the condition of the structure.

Figure 6-66. Structure W6-B (41HY541)—Collapsed Shed (Facing West)

Structure W6-C—Barn (ca. 1920)
Structure W6-C is a barn with a rectangular footprint measuring approximately
10.0 meters (32.8 feet) northwest to southeast by 7.0 meters (23.0 feet) northeast to southwest
located west of the house (Structure W6-A) (Figures 6-67 to 6-68). This barn is sheltered with an
end-gabled roof clad in corrugated metal. The gable ends are clad in corrugated metal. The pole
barn has three open-bays on the northern side. The southeastern portion of the structure served
as a garage, while the northwestern portion appears to have been used as a workshop. No
flooring is present.

Concrete-Capped Well (ca. 1956)
Located immediately west of the house is a large concrete-capped well (Figure 6-69). The
top of the well rises approximately 50.8 centimeters (20.0 inches) above ground, and the well is
approximately 1.5 meters (5.0 feet) in diameter. A metal-capped access port is positioned offcenter on the well. The concrete well cap has an inscription that reads “1956 SEP. RMS.”

large tires from farm equipment; and farm equipment. The historic-age cultural materials on the
site are generally diagnostic of the early to mid-20th century.
Historical Research
The USGS San Marcos, Texas, topographic quadrangle of shows a house located at site
41HY531 (see Figure 4-2). The chain of title for the property indicates that, in 1895, Owen Ford
and C.H. Word sold 173.6 hectares (429.0 acres) out of the Hemphill Survey to T.C. Johnson and
G.C. Johnson. In 1949, J.M. Johnson sold 46.9 hectares (116.0 acres) to Ruth Johnson, T.C.
Johnson, Jr., and Lucy Pettey (of California). The Johnson family may be related to Thomas
Jefferson Johnson, who founded the Johnson Institute near Driftwood, Texas. The school was a
private secondary school (Stovall et al. 1986). In 1996, the property was sold via a trust from
Thomas Sewell, Jr. (he inherited the property from Lucy Pettey) to the Wahrmund family. The
house was likely constructed during the ownership of T.C. Johnson during the boom of agricultural
production.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41HY541 represents the remnants of an early to mid-20th-century farmstead
consisting of an unusual brick house, a barn, a concrete well, and a collapsed shed. The house
(Structure W6-A) is the earliest structure on the site (ca. 1900), and the larger of the two
outbuildings (Structure W6-C) was constructed somewhat later (ca. 1920). The smaller shed

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

(Structure W6-B) represents a later era of construction (ca. 1950s). The concrete well cap has
an inscription indicating the well was capped in 1956, though the well itself may be older.
According to Mr. Curby Ohnheiser, a local rancher who stopped by while Horizon’s archeologists
were recording site 41HY541, the site was most recently inhabited by some renters who burned
the house down about four years ago. Mr. Ohnheiser did not know who lived in the house before
the renters, but he did mention that the locals call it “Rattlesnake House” because the basement
is usually full of rattlesnakes.
The house, barn, shed, and well are associated with the early agricultural development
and German settlement in Hays County near the Pecan Springs community or the Plum Creek
valley. The site and surrounding agricultural fields are associated with this period in history and
could be considered significant under Criterion A. All of the buildings and structures on the
property are in poor condition. While the house ruins provide some indication of a turn-of-thecentury farmstead, the complex lacks integrity of design, workmanship, materials, association,
and feeling in order to convey this significance. The style of the house, the primary resource, is
underdetermined due to the substantial fire damage. The property likely included additional
historic-age structures at one time.
The Owen, Word, or Wahrmund families do not appear in any of the previous surveys,
prepared historic contexts, online searches, or in Stovall et al. (1986). The property is not known
to be associated with an important person or family; therefore, it is not significant under
Criterion B. The house and outbuildings do not embody distinctive characteristics of a type,
period, or method of construction; do not represent the work of a master; and do not possess high
artistic values. Therefore the property is not significant under Criterion C. Due to a lack of historic
integrity, the property is considered not eligible for listing on the NRHP. Furthermore, while there
is an abundance of domestic debris on the site, the cultural materials do not possess any special
capacity to contribute meaningfully to knowledge of the historical past. As such, the site is not
considered significant under Criterion D. Site 41HY541 is recommended as not eligible for
designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the NRHP.

6.7

SITE 41HY542
General Description

Site 41HY542 represents the remnants of an early to mid-20th-century farmstead
composed of a standing barn, a collapsed structure, and an associated scatter of domestic debris
(Figure 6-70; also see Figure 6-1). Historically, the site was accessed via an unimproved field
road that extended southeastward from FM 158 to the northwest past the site location before
bending to the west and south, crossing an unnamed tributary of Hemphill Creek, and continuing
southwestward to articulate with Yarrington Road. This old field road is visible even on recent
USGS topographic quadrangles (see Figure 1-1), though the portion of this road located north of
the unnamed tributary of Hemphill Creek is no longer extant. The site is located on a rolling
upland landform in a small copse of trees surrounded by active agricultural fields. Vegetation on
the site consists of post oak, hackberry, and sycamore trees as well as various grasses and
weeds. Elevations on the site are relatively flat, ranging only from approximately 195.7 to
196.3 meters (642.0 to 644.0 feet) amsl.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and historic-age debris, site 41HY542 measures
approximately 94.0 meters (308.3 feet) northeast to southwest by 54.0 meters (177.1 feet)
northwest to southeast.
Cultural materials on site 41HY542 are largely constrained to the modern ground surface,
though one of the six shovel tests excavated on the site yielded shallow subsurface archeological
deposits extending to a depth of 15.0 centimeters (5.9 inches) below surface.
Cultural Features Observed
Cultural features on site 41HY542 include a standing barn (Structure W7) and a pile of
construction debris that may represent the former location of a house that probably served as the
primary residence on the site.

Structure W7—Barn (ca. 1915)
Structure W7 is a frame barn with a rectangular footprint measuring approximately
9.0 meters (29.5 feet) east to west by 7.0 meters (23.0 feet) north to south (Figures 6-71 to 6-72).
An end-gabled roof shelters the building, which is clad in corrugated metal. The wood-planked
sides of the barn are also clad in corrugated metal. Two rectangular window openings are found
on the southern side of the barn. Cypress piers support the pier-and-beam barn. The barn may
have been used as a chicken coop.

Figure 6-72. Structure W7 (41HY542)—Northeastern Corner of Barn (Facing Southeast)

Collapsed House
Approximately 30.0 meters (98.4 feet) northeast of the barn (Structure W7) is a large pile
of construction debris and building elements that may represent the former location of the primary
residence on the site (Figures 6-73 to 6-74). The debris pile measures approximately 20.0 meters
(65.6 feet) northeast to southwest by 15.0 meters (49.2 feet) northwest to southeast. The
collapsed structure was likely a plank-wall house constructed ca. 1910. A portion of a brick
chimney flue, portions of a shingled roof, portions of a wood-planked floor, window glass,
evidence of a ceramic knob and tube wiring, and domestic debris are scattered across the site
(Figure 6-75). It is also possible the collapsed outbuilding was second barn, as recent USGS
topographic quadrangles show two outbuildings at this location. In this case, the barns were
probably associated with a larger farmstead on the other side of the unnamed tributary of Hemphill
Creek farther south along the field road that provides access to this site.
Cultural Materials Observed
Cultural materials observed on the site include clear, amber, amethyst, olive green, aqua,
and milk glass shards; a blue ceramic insulator; glazed stoneware sherds; whiteware ceramic
sherds; ceramic tile fragments; a rubber button; an amber glass bottle top with a packer-style
finish, tool markings, and no side seems (i.e., not machine-made); one clear glass jar handle; red

diagnostic of the early to mid-20th century.
Historical Research
The property on which site 41HY542 is located (the same property on which site 41HY539
is located) was owned by David William (D.W.) Crews in 1912 prior to conveying the property to
his son, Samuel Crews, during that same year. Prior to this time period, the Crews family (wife
Ann and their 10 children) lived in Hays County Precinct 2 according to the US census of 1880.
D.W. Crews owned numerous acres of land in Hays County during the late 19th and early
20th centuries. D.W. Crews is indicated as a farmer on the agricultural schedules of 1880. It is
not known if he ever lived on this particular property. Samuel Crews is listed on the World War I
draft registration (1917-1918) as a farmer and a resident of Precinct 2 in Hays County. By 1934,
the property was sold to J.M. Young, who later sold the property to Aubra Young and later Edward
Young (Aubra’s son). Aubra Young is listed on the 1940 census for Precinct 2 as a farmer who
owns his own land with a home valued at $1,500. By 1942, he and his wife Alice lived in San
Marcos, though he worked in Kyle according to US World War II draft registration cards. David
A. Young was one of Kyle’s first grocers, having opened a mercantile store after the railroad was
established (Myers 2004). It has not been confirmed that J.M, Aubra, and David Young are
related, but is a high likelihood. The property eventually ended up with the Warhmund family (in
1983) prior to the sale to investment bankers and developers in 2005.

Figure 6-76. Historic-age Cultural Materials Observed on Site 41HY542

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41HY542 represents the remnants of an early to mid-20th-century farmstead
composed of a standing barn, a collapsed structure, and an associated scatter of domestic debris.
The site may have been part of a larger farm complex located southwest of the site across an
unnamed tributary of Hemphill Creek (outside of the project area). Based on aerial imagery, this
farm complex to the southwest appears to include several barns as well as a house. However,
site 41HY542 is currently not on the same legal parcel as the farm complex to the south. Rather,
site 41HY542 is currently on the same parcel as site 41HY539. If this property was once
associated with the farm complex to the south, this house may have been a tenant dwelling based
on the location near the fields, behind the main house, and near the outbuildings.
The barn on site 41HY542 (Structure W7) is associated with the early agricultural
development and German settlement in Hays County near the Pecan Springs community or the
Plum Creek valley. The barn and surrounding agricultural fields are associated with this period
in history and could be considered significant under Criterion A. The barn is in poor condition and
lacks integrity of design, workmanship, materials, association, and feeling in order to convey this
significance. The house (or possibly a second barn) that was once adjacent to the standing barn
is currently a pile of debris. The property likely included additional historic-age structures at one
time. The Crews and Warhmund families do not appear in any of the previous surveys, prepared
historic contexts, online searches, or in Stovall et al. (1986). The Young family is associated with

the first grocery store, though the founder, David Young, is far removed from the time period of
construction; therefore, the association with this person is minimal. The property is not known to
be associated with an important person or family; therefore, it is not significant under Criterion B.
The barn does not embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction;
does not represent the work of a master; and does not possess high artistic values. Therefore
the property is not significant under Criterion C. Due to a lack of historic integrity, the property is
considered not eligible for listing on the NRHP. Furthermore, the ephemeral archeological
deposits on the site are constrained to the modern ground surface and shallow subsurface
contexts. The archeological deposits are disturbed, lack integrity, and possess minimal potential
to contribute to knowledge of the historical past. As such, the site is not considered significant
under Criterion D. Site 41HY542 is recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL or for
inclusion in the NRHP.

SITE 41HY543
General Description

Site 41HY537 is a multiple-component site consisting of the remnants of an early to mid20th-century farmstead and a low-density scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts located off the
southwestern side of FM 158 (Figure 6-77; also see Figure 6-1). The historic-age component
consists of a collapsed wooden structure, a concrete livestock trough, an elevated metal cistern
mounted on a concrete stand, and an associated scatter of domestic debris. The aboriginal
component consists of three bifaces and a sparse scatter of lithic debitage. The site is situated
on a rolling upland landform in a small copse of trees surrounded by active agricultural fields
(Figure 6-78). Vegetation on the site consists of small saplings and various weeds and grasses.
Elevations on the site are relatively flat, ranging only from approximately 208.5 to 209.1 meters
(684.0 to 686.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and historic-age debris, site 41HY543 measures
approximately 67.0 meters (219.8 feet) northeast to southwest by 100.0 meters (328.0 feet)
northwest to southeast.
Cultural materials on site 41HY543 are largely constrained to the modern ground surface,
though two of the six shovel tests excavated on the site revealed shallow subsurface
archeological deposits extending to a depth of 10.0 centimeters (3.9 inches) below surface.
Cultural Features Observed
Two historic-age cultural features, a concrete livestock trough and an elevated metal
cistern, are present on site 41HY543. In addition, an extensive scatter of construction debris
located to the southeast of the animal trough and cistern likely represents the former location of
a wood-frame house that once stood on the site. No aboriginal cultural features were observed
on the site.

Concrete Trough (ca. 1920)
The trough is rectangular and is supported on a concrete stand (Figure 6-79). The trough
measures approximately 0.6 by 1.5 meters (2.0 by 5.0 feet) in size and is located adjacent to the
cistern.

Cistern (ca. 1920)
The riveted metal cylindrical cistern is supported on a poured concrete circular platform
(Figure 6-80). The cistern is approximately 3.0 meters (10.0 feet) in diameter.
Cultural Materials Observed
Historic-age cultural materials observed on site 41HY543 include clear, blue, green, aqua,
and amber glass shards; plain and transfer-print whiteware ceramic sherds; one glass marble;
red cherry brick fragments; concrete fragments; cut limestone fragments; and unidentified metal
fragments (Figure 6-81). The scatter of historic-age domestic debris is located southeast of the
trough and cistern and defines a somewhat coherent area measuring approximately 45.0 meters
(147.6 feet) east to west by 20.0 meters (65.6 feet) north to south. Historic-age cultural materials
are generally diagnostic of an early to mid-20th-century occupation.

Aboriginal cultural materials observed on site 41HY543 include three bifaces and a sparse

artifacts, the aboriginal occupation of the site can only be dated to an unspecified prehistoric
timeframe.
Historical Research
Site 41HY543 was once part of a larger farm belonging to Henry and Minna Neiman prior
to 1908. Henry was 53 in 1908. The land stayed in the Nieman family until 1937 when Ida Nieman
(age 54 at the time) sold the property to Otto Heidemann. Henry Nieman was a former Texas
Ranger. He purchased a farm in 1890, and his home was one of the first to have a Delco plant
to provide electricity. In 1916, Charles Kettering designed and developed a family of complete
electric power systems (Delco plants) to provide electricity to farms, country homes, businesses,
cabins, resorts, schools, churches, small towns, country clubs, and virtually every rural or remote
building. Farmers could purchase the small generator and install it in an outbuilding or near their
homes (Delco-Light Farm Electric Plant 2017).
Families that lived nearby were Aubrey Young, Johnson Farm, and Emil Ehrlich (Stovall
et al. 1986). Henry Nieman is listed as a farmer, age 72, in the 1920 US census. The Hiedemanns
kept the property until 1975 when the property was sold to Frank and Joyce Eichmann. The 1911
USGS San Marcos, Texas, topographic quadrangle shows a house on this property close to

FM 158 (see Figure 4-2). The farm may have been established by the Nieman family during the
turn of the 20th century.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41HY537 is a multiple-component site consisting of the remnants of an early to mid20th-century farmstead and a low-density scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts. The historic-age
component consists of a collapsed wooden structure, a concrete livestock trough, an elevated
metal cistern mounted on a concrete stand, and an associated scatter of domestic debris. The
aboriginal component consists of three bifaces and a sparse scatter of lithic debitage.
The trough and cistern are associated with the early agricultural development and German
settlement in Hays County near the Pecan Springs community or the Plum Creek valley. These
features and the surrounding plowed fields are associated with this period in history and could be
considered significant under Criterion A. The structures are no longer associated with a primary
resource, such as a farmhouse. The compromised integrity of association and feeling
substantially diminishes the conveyance of historical significance for these ancillary agricultural
structures. The property likely included additional historic-age structures at one time. The
Heidemann and Eichmann families do not appear in any of the previous surveys, prepared historic
contexts, online searches, or in Stovall et al. (1986). The property is not known to be associated
with an important person or family; therefore, it is not significant under Criterion B. The features
do not embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; do not

represent the work of a master; and do not possess high artistic values. Therefore the property
is not significant under Criterion C. Due to a lack of historic integrity, the property is considered
not eligible for listing on the NRHP. Furthermore, the ephemeral archeological deposits
associated with both the historic-age and aboriginal components are constrained to the modern
ground surface and shallow subsurface deposits. The archeological deposits are disturbed, lack
integrity, and possess minimal potential to contribute to knowledge of the historic or prehistoric
past. As such, the site is not considered significant under Criterion D. Site 41HY543 is
recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the NRHP.

SITE 41HY544
General Description

Site 41HY544 consists of a moderate-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts
in a plowed field in an upland setting adjacent to an unnamed tributary of Hemphill Creek
(Figure 6-83). The surrounding upland landscape contains a high density of chert-bearing
limestone gravels and cobbles exposed on the modern ground surface of the active plowzone,
and the site appears to represent a lithic raw material procurement locality (i.e., “quarry”)
(Figure 6-84). An ephemeral drainage flows southeastward, forming the southwestern boundary
of the site (Figure 6-85). Aside from a recently planted corn crop, no natural vegetation occurs
within the site boundaries. Elevations on the site are relatively flat, ranging only from
approximately 196.0 to 197.0 meters (643.0 to 646.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of aboriginal cultural debris, site 41HY544 measures approximately
85.0 meters (278.8 feet) in diameter.
Cultural materials on site 41HY544 are constrained to the modern ground surface. None
of the six shovel tests excavated on the site revealed subsurface archeological deposits, though
it is likely that some cultural materials have been incorporated into the shallow plowzone.
Cultural Features Observed
No cultural features or other cultural materials suggestive of cultural features (such as
burned rocks) were observed on site 41HY544.
Cultural Materials Observed
Cultural materials observed on site 41HY544 included approximately five ephemeral flake
tools, five to 10 bifaces, and 10 to 20 pieces of lithic debitage (Figure 6-86). No formal tools,
temporally diagnostic artifacts, or preserved floral or faunal remains were observed on the site.

SITE 41HY546
General Description

Site 41HY546 consists of a moderate-density, surficial scatter of late 19th- to 20th-century
debris and modern trash in an upland setting overlooking two unnamed tributaries of Hemphill
Creek that arise to the south (Figure 6-91). The site is in a remote location in the middle of an
active agricultural field (Figure 6-92). No existing roads or historical roads are visible on historical
aerial imagery or USGS topographic maps that would have provided access to the site (NETR
2017). Furthermore, no construction materials or structural remnants are present among the
scatter of historic-age and modern domestic debris, and no standing structures are depicted at
this location on historical aerial photographs or topographic maps; as such, it would appear that
this was not the location of a historic-age farmstead. The site simply appears to represent a dump
of historic-age and modern trash. Vegetation on the site is limited to a recently planted corn crop.
Elevations across the site are relatively flat, ranging only from approximately 197.6 to
198.5 meters (648.0 to 651.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of aboriginal cultural debris, site 41HY546 measures approximately

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs and for inclusion in the NRHP.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
and NRHP evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the project area and to make preliminary determinations of whether or
not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important
historic events and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs,
respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The four criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by three requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least one of the four criteria for eligibility listed
above, and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As
discussed here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory
and history according to various periods of development in various times and at various places.
Thus, the significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic
development and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular
period of development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding
of prehistory. All four criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought
to bear for historic sites.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

From March 20 to 30, 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana Smith, with the
assistance of archeological technicians Jacob Lyons and Ben Johnson and under the overall
direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive survey of the project
area to locate any cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed undertaking. Kathryn
St. Clair, architectural historian, assisted with architectural evaluations and historical research on
sites containing standing architecture or remnants of standing structures. Eleven newly recorded
archeological sites were documented during the survey—41HY536 to 41HY546 (Table 7-1). Nine
of the 11 sites (41HY436 to 41HY543 and 41HY546) consist of the remnants of early to mid-20thcentury farmsteads and/or scatters of historic-age domestic debris. Two of the 11 sites (41HY544
and 41HY545) consist exclusively of aboriginal artifact scatters dated to unspecified prehistoric
timeframes, and secondary cultural components composed of sparse scatters of aboriginal
artifacts were also observed on three of the nine historic-age sites (41HY537, 41HY540, and
41HY543).
The project area is composed of rural agricultural land, primarily corn fields. All of the
project area falls within the William Hemphill Land Grant, which was originally granted in 1847
and included 1,743.7 hectares (4,308.8 acres) (Texas General Land Office, Abstract No. 221,
Patent No. 230). The majority of the project area was owned by the same owner at least as early
as 1912.
The sites identified within the project area are all located on rural properties that were
once part of, or continue to be part of, farms and ranches. All of the identified historic-age
architectural resources are related to agricultural sites, including the houses identified. Most of
the resources are in poor condition, and most of them are no longer part of a cohesive grouping
of agricultural structures, and therefore lack historical context. The resources identified range
from the remains of a ca.1900 house to ca. 1930s houses and barns. Most of the properties are
vacant, though the surrounding fields remain cultivated.

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

To evaluate historical significance of the resources that remain extant on this rural area,
the NRHP Multiple Property Nomination Form prepared for Rural Properties of Hays County
(Myers 2004) was consulted to maintain a consistent approach in evaluating the significance of
these rural resources. Each site on which historic-age resources were identified was evaluated
as a cluster of resources as they relate to one another as each site was part of a farm or ranch at
one time. Most of the sites, including 41HY536 to 41HY541, were all owed by the same land
owner at least as far back as 1912 (Hays County Deed Records, Vol. 61, page 577). Deed
research, federal census records review, and online searches were conducted to provide insight
on past property owners for each property. This information is important in order to understand if
the sites are associated with persons of historical importance.
The following excerpt was provided by Myers (2004) on the aforementioned NRHP form.
This evaluation approach was considered for the resources identified on sites 41HY536 to
41HY543 for the current project:
Agricultural resources represent a large percentage of the county’s historic built
environment. They are an important part of Hays County's legacy of the late 19th and early
20th centuries as tangible links to its physical development. Agricultural properties can
have both historical and architectural significance and may be eligible for listing in the
National Register under Criteria A, B or C, either individually or as part of a historic district.
An agricultural property with historical significance is one that is representative of important
events or trends of the past (Criterion A) or is associated with an individual(s) that made
noteworthy contributions to the county's historic development (Criterion B).
An agricultural property with architectural significance is one that displays notable physical
features, craftsmanship or design, or is an exemplary illustration of a type. They can be
listed in the National Register under Criterion C. In general, however, agricultural
properties are common utilitarian buildings and structures built with modest materials.
They are subject to changes in function rather than fashion and retain their defining form
and characteristics over time. Agricultural properties in rural Hays County are generally
identified by subtypes that include barns, vehicle garages, chicken coops, pig pens, corrals,
grain and feed sheds, dairy barns or sheds, and other buildings and structures related to
the raising of crops and livestock. Most are of simple frame or corrugated metal
construction with gabled or hipped roofs.
Agricultural buildings can be considered for nomination to the National Register if they are
at least 50 years old and retain a significant amount of their architectural integrity. They
should be recognizable to their period of significance which, in most cases, is the date of
construction. To be listed in the National Register, an agricultural building must also meet
at least one of the four National Register Criteria for Evaluation. An individual agricultural
building or a historic district or site comprised primarily of agricultural properties must be
strongly linked with and related to the associated historic context. The Statement of
Significance should discuss how the individual property or historic district meets the
National Register criteria and how the area relates to, and is associated with, the historic
context.
Because an individual agricultural property being nominated under Criteria A or B is one
with strong historical associations, it does not necessarily have to be unaltered or a
particularly noteworthy example of an architectural type or form. It should, however, be
126

DRAFT

closely associated with important trends and events in the past (Criterion A) or with
individuals who have been historically significant (Criterion B). Whether nominated under
Criteria A or B, a strong argument must be made to establish the relative importance of
that event, trend or person within 19th and early 20th century development in Hays County.
Merely stating, for example, that a barn belonged to a locally successful farmer is not
enough to justify listing in the National Register. The accomplishments of that individual
must be articulated and then related to the historic context. Also, such a property must
have been used by that person when significance was achieved or be the residence most
closely associated with that individual. The property must retain sufficient integrity to be
recognizable to its Period of Significance.
Some individual historic agricultural properties are candidates for listing in the National
Register under Criterion C as excellent or rare examples of a type or method of
construction. Seldom do they represent the work of an architect or master builder.
However, that property's relation with the historic context must also be addressed.
Moreover, its physical integrity must be retained to a large degree. A building's exterior
detailing should appear almost exactly as it did when it was originally constructed or when
it was sympathetically altered before 1951.
While architectural fabric inevitably
deteriorates over time, restoration, rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts should be
sensitive to a dwelling's historic character and should utilize shapes, forms and materials
that are compatible with original detailing. The installation of historically inappropriate
elements which obscure or detract from a property's integrity, therefore, can make it
ineligible for the National Register (Myer, 2004).

The identified resources were also assessed for their potential eligibility as contributing to
a rural historic landscape district due to the linkage of the common agricultural theme. The NPS
defines a rural historic landscape district as a resource that:
Is a geographical area that historically has been used by people, or shaped or modified by
human activity, occupancy, or intervention, and that possesses a significant concentration,
linkage or continuity of areas of land use, vegetation, buildings and structures, roads and
waterways, and natural features (National Register Bulletin 30).

The resources all date from the first quarter (or close to that) of the 20th century (which is
considered the period of significance for the recorded resources), and are all related to agriculture
and settlement of this area of the county. However, the architectural resources lack integrity,
primarily of association and feeling. Most of the recorded resources are secondary or ancillary
structures lacking an associated primary resource. There is a lack of continuity of the resource
types, and significant concentration of land use and human-modified landscape features within
the project area. The project area is not considered a Rural Historic Landscape District, and it is
not likely the identified resources would be considered contributing resources to a larger district
should one be identified in the area at a later time.
None of the recorded resources meet the NRHP or SAL criteria for significance, and they
do not retain integrity individually or as small farm or ranch complexes identified and associated
with archeological sites. All of the resources are associated with the early rural agricultural
development of Hays County and the Blackland Prairie region. However, the resources no longer
retain integrity to convey the significance of an early Hays County ranch properties. Therefore, it

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

is recommended that the proposed project would have no effect on historic-age resources
identified within the project.
There are no resources within the project area that have been previously determined
eligible or that are recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. There are no SALs,
Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHL), or Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHM) within
the project area. All 11 sites recorded within the current project area are recommended as
ineligible for designation as SALs and for inclusion in the NRHP based on the poor condition of
the sites and their low potential to contribute meaningfully to an understanding of the historic
and/or prehistoric past No further investigations are warranted on these sites in connection with
the proposed undertaking.

7.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or for inclusion in the NRHP according
to 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further
archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However,
human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety
Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery,
and the THC should be notified immediately.
