INTRODUCTION

This report documents the reconnaissance of archeological and bistorical
resources located near the proposed SEADOCK site.

The area covered includes

the proposed and alternate locations for the pipeline route from the deep­
water terminal to the onshore storage terminal, and for the onshore terminal
itself.

All are located west of Freeport, in ,Brazoria County, as shown in

Figure A-I.

The purpose of this reconnaissance was to make a comprehensive evaluation
"

Of the location and significance of archeological and historic sites.

The

."~ ,.A

survey consisted of a reconnaissance of proposed Terminal Site I, which is
located on the eastern boundary of the

c=)

Clemen~

State Farm south of Highway

36, Terminal Site II, which is located southeast of the town of Jones Creek
and west of Jones Creek, and the proposed and alternate pipeline routes
designated as A, B, C, D, E, and F in Figure A-I.

In order to keep a per­

spective on what sites are located in or on specific areas which have been
designated for possible sites of construction, this report will deal with
each area separately.

At the present time, construction is expected to occur only at Terminal

-.

Site II and along pipeline route E.

A.2

TYPES OF RESOURCE SITES

Resource sites located during field reconnaissance were categorized by the
type of activity which occurred at the site (as indicated by surface appear­
ance) , and by site location.

Five distinctive types of sites were identi­

fied -- (1) historic, (2) estuarine gathering stations, (3) estuarine base
camps, (4) brackish-lake gathering stations, and (5) brackish-lake base
camps.

A.2.l

Each of the five types is described below.

HISTORIC

Historic sites are identified by age and cultural affiliation.

The only

historic site located is in the upland prairies '1ft the area designated as
Terminal Site I (see Figure A-I).

The site has been designated as 41 BO 80,

in accordance ~ithlthe standard nomenclature used in the United States.

A.2.2

ESTUARINE GATHERING STATIONS

The gathering station type of site is identified by its small size (usually
less than 16 sq m) and by the sparcity of artifacts found on the surface.
The spacial range of these sites extends from the mouth of the San Bernard
River (41 BO 81) to approximately 7 km upstream (41 BO 98).

All of these'

sites are shell middens ranging in thickness from a few cm to over 1 m.
The sites appear to represent fairly regular intermittent occupation rather
than single long-term occupation.

mics practiced at this particular type of site.

in the immediate vicinity.

The 12 estuarine gathering stations are the most numerous type of 'sites
located during the survey.

Although proximity to the coast varied between

sites, all seem to have functioned as sites in which the primary activity
was that of harvesting shellfish from the San Bernard River •.

A.2.3

ESTUARINE BASE CAMPS

The estuarine base camps is a category into which the larger estuarine sites
were placed.

These sites, although not as thick as some of the gathering

station sites, had extremely large surface areas. . It is hypothesized that
inhabitants of these sites may have conducted a'wider range of activities·for
a longer period of time than the inhabitants of the gathering stations.

settlement consisted of.

The sites which were categorized as estuarine base

camps are 41 BO 95 and 41 BO 96.

Both of these sites are extremely large and

are located approximately 8 km from the Gulf of Mexico.

A.2.4

BRACKISH-LAKE GATHERING STATIONS

The brackish-lake gathering station type of site is very similar to that of
an estuarine gathering station in appearance. "The only apparent difference
between the two is simply the location of the midden.

The brackish-lake

gathering stations, when inhabited, were located on the banks of the brackish

The inhabitants

of these sites probably had subsistence patterns and technology similar to
the inhabitants of the estuarine gathering stations.

Two sites were placed

in this category - 41 BO 99, which is located adjacent to Cedar Lakes I

& II; and 41 BO 86, which is located along Jones Lake.

(as evidenced by the large and diverse faunal material present) that habitats

Among these habitats were brackish water

Although

a detailed archeological investigation of 41 BO 79 is in order, a fairly good
idea of what the site apparently contains was recovered by the survey.

The

site is apparently located on what was once the banks of Jones Lake.

RESOURCE SITE IDENTIFICATION AND LOCATION

TERMINAL SITE I

Terminal Site I is located on the eastern boundary of the Clemens State Farm
south of Highway 36 (Figure A-I).

o

The only site observed in this area was a

historic site which appears to be the remnants of a plantation complex.

Two

major concentrations of ruins and brick'" structures were found in separate
locations of the survey area.

quarters, ruins of a sugar mill, several brick cisterns and a host of accumula­
tions of brick debris.

Sterling McNeel was given title to the land in 1824.

Additional inquiries pointed out that in all probability the site which was
located by the survey was the site of the home of Mr. McNeel which was first
occupied in the mid-1820's.

The site was given the number of 41 BO 80 in

accordance with the standard identification nomenclature which is widely
used in the United States in recording sites.

Although the site'. has not been

listed on the National Register, steps are being,taken in order

A.3.2

ALTERNATE TERMINAL SITE II

Terminal Site II is lo'cated approximately 1 km south of Highway 36 and 1 km
we~tof

Jones Creek (Figure A-I).

Although the exact size and shape of this
\

location for this' site was unknown during the archeological reconnaissance,
it seemed logical that it would be similar in area to Terminal Site I.

The

survey was conducted in the general area around the point which was taken to
represent the center of the site (Figure A-I).

Nothing in the way of historic

or prehistoric material to indicate the presence of a resource site was
located in the area.

However, a map compiled by Mr. John Ewing indicates

that there was a plantation complex located within the estimated boundaries of
Terminal Site II.

It was situated on property Mhich was originally owned

by Stephen F. Austin, and. was recorded as the Durazno Plantation by Mr.
Ewing.

Inasmuch as no historic or prehistoric material was encountered, the

archeological significances of the site must be considered minimal at this
time.

be prehistoric, although some may be of recent origin.

41 BO 92 lies along routes Band C north of the point at which the routes
cross the San Bernard River (Figure A-I).

The site is a shell midden exposed

in a cut bank of the river; it is classified as a temporary gathering station.

This site is of particular interest due to its location on a brackish lake
rather than a flowing river.

The site undoubtedly has the poten!2ia1 for

yielding data of a rather specialized nature due to the fact that only two
other sites located during the survey were associated with a brackish lake
habitat.

the San Bernard River.

In what ways (if any) this unique locat'ionaffected

the life styles of the people who occupied the site is unknown.

The other

sites in the area are all located in cut banks of the San Bernard River and
are basically very similar to one another.

Some of these sites' middens are

as thick as 1 m, which may mean that these sites were used and reused as
gathering stations intermittently over a very long time periQd.

These

sites may contain an accurate chronological record of subsistence dynamics
which were occurring as a result of environmental changes and changes in

Intracoastal Waterway (see Figure A-1).

Two sites, 41 BO 79 and 41 BO 86,

were located near the route's intersection with the Intracoastal Waterway.
41 BO 86 is located on the northern bank of the Waterway and 41 BO 79 is
located on the south bank.

DESCRIPTION OF RESOURCE SITES

A.4.l

HISTORIC 41 BO 80

41 BO 80 is a historic plantation complex located on the Huntington Ranch
south of Highway 36 and east of the Clemens State Prison Farm (Figure A-I).
The structures are concentrated in two distinct areas.
on both sides of the ranch road leading to the modern

It consists of the remains of a brick sugar mill,

one intact brickhouse, several brick cisterns, and foundations of several
unidentified structures.

The second concentration is indicated directly

south of the modern ranch house and consists of seven identifiable cisterns,

o

the ruins of one multi-room structure, and several unidentified accumulations
of brick.

The site has been identified as the Ellerslie Plantation, an historic
industrial and residential complex of the early 19th Century.

Part of

41 BO 80 is clearly visible from the ranch road, as some of the structures
of the plantation are still standing and are located close to the road.
The most striking structure consists of three large brick supports which
are

~resumed

to be part of an early sugar mill (Figure A-2). - These supports

are about 2.5 m high and 4.5 m long.

They taper from about I m to 0.3 m

wide at the top, and are approximately 0.5 m apart at the base.

They are

constructed parallel to one another on a north-south axis, with massive beams
laying across the top of the supports.

The remains of a stairway which

led to the top of the structure are located to the west of the three supports
and a rather large accumulation of rubble is located on the eastern side of

Analysis

The architectural remains at the Ellersly Plantation site produced some
interesting features that warrant more consideration.

The construction

techniques, types and sizes of construction materials, and the evidence of
a probable systematic planning sequence were significant even after a cursory
examination.

These areas certanly require more study before any definitive

statements can be made regarding their relationship to the
sequence.

construction specifics, the information is

;

its real. significance is not yet evident.

The only construction material on the site, with the exception of a few
pieces of wood, was brick masonry.

The building bricks that were examined

appear to be of the same basic type, that is, a normal size of 5 cm x
10 cm x 20 cm with small variations usually seen in handmade bricks.
They ranged in color from a warm rust to a charcoal brown but appeared to
be uniform in their texture and composition.

The clay used for their con­

struction was probably from the same general source.

A notable variation

in brick size can be found in the cylindrical extensions of some cistern
openings.

These bricks are wedge-shaped with a uniform thickness and are

somewhat longer than the normal bricks found on the site.

The mortar used both in the existing structures such as the cisterns, support
piers, and the one complete building and the many foundations was of a rich
quality.

While there was evidence of some shell fragments in the mortar,

it is certainly possible that another source existed for the amount of
lime required.

All the mortar appeared to be of the same general type but

only a more sophisticated analysis of specific samples will lend assistance
in determining possible variations which might indicate various 'building
periods.

The results of the mortar analysis

can~ot

be used alone to make

a definitive statement as to the bllilding sequence, but it is certainly a
useful tool when used in conjunction with other av&llable information.

The basic masonry construction techniques appeareq to be fairly uniform
throughout.

Walls and foundations varied from two to three bricks in thickness

with possible exceptions occurring in the foundation in the probable vicinity
of the main house.

The actual coursing, or the laying of brick in a single

horizontal layer; is relatively uniform in the one complete building and
,

the large piers.

Five to seven rows of stretchers are separated by a single

row of headers.

In the existing building, the row of headers on the exterior

face of the wall is one course lower than the row of headers on the interior
face.

This is not the case in the piers since there is no real interior

surface.

This use of headers and stretchers is also

McNeel's Ellerslie Plantation, established in 1824.

It meets the qualifica­

tions for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and is one.
of the few remaining examples of ante-bellum plantation life i? Texas.
The streamrrun sugar mill at Ellerslie was one of only 29 which existed in
Texas at the height of the sugar cultivation.

Most of the other mills

built in the "lower settlement" ~egion of the coast have been totally des­
troyed by hurricanes.

consistently

produced the third highest quantity of sugar in Texas through the 1850's

and early 1860's.

It is obvious, therefore, that Ellerslie was an important

plantation and that efforts to save the site should be considered.

41 BO 79

General

41 BO 79 is a prehistoric shell midden site which is located on the southern
bank of the Intracoastal Waterway about 1.3 km east of the San Bernard River.
It was discovered by J. W. McMichael on June

20~

1973.

Site Description

)
The site is located in a cut bank of the canal, and is shown in Figure <A-4.
Two distinct shell lenses are visible in the bank.

At one pOint near the

center, the two lenses merge.

At this point, the lenses are 50 cm thick and

the shells are quite compact.

Near the eastern end of the site the midden

has been almost totally eroded leaving only scattered shell on the beach.
The lower shell zone thins out quickly near the western end of the site,
-while the upper lens thins to no more than one shell thick, but is fairly
consistent.

The total length of the site is about 70 m (including the

destroyed'eastern section).

About 60 cm of reddish clay covers the site.

Part of this appears to be wash coming off the spoil bank located directly

Directly underneath the shell is a black "gumboil type

The darkness of this soil may be attributed to organic materials

from the site as it appears nowhere except directly under the midden.

Although the bulk of the shell is oyster, considerable numbers of Rangia'cuneata
and Rangia flexuosa were present.

There was also conch (busycon) (Dinocardium

robustum) and other marine shellfish scattered within the midden.

Survey Procedure

The depth and areal extent of the site were delineated by measuring the
exposed midden and by using auger borings.

A surface collection was made and a bulk mat.r..i x'·sample was taken to provide
data on subsistence modifications between the two occupations of the site.
The surface collection was more extensive

area as far as numbers and diversity of artifacts were concerned.

Laboratory

analysis of the 107 identifiable potsherds recovered revealed that three
distinct ceramic types were found.

The three types of ceramics were:

(1)

Sandy paste plain (Goose-creek plain); (2) Grog-tempered plain (San Jacinto
Plain); and (3) Shell-tempered plain (untyped).

Grog-tempered ceramics and sandy paste ceramics were encountered with about
~qual

frequency.

This information is useful as a significant amount of data

is available on both types in coastal regions, and a correlation between the
two ceramic types found at this location and from other sites in the coastal
regions could be formulated and put to
gression in the area.

A dramatic change can be detected in the amount of bone recovered from
strata 1 to strata 2•. The change becomes apparent when comparing the
amount of bone recovered from the fine shell.

The percentages of bone in

the fine shell changes from about 10 percent in zone I to, 4 percent in
zone II.

This change (if fairly consistent throughout the site) would

indicate major shifts in subsistence patterns.

It would also be plausible

that technological changes took place at the same time.

Nonetheless, an

extensive excavation would have to be undertaken before conclusive evidence
would be available.

A possible change in habitat exploitation is not

available due to lack of identification of the animal bones which were
recovered, but may be tested by excavation.

Rangia cuneata shells have been the center of attention in dealing with

shell middens due to the presence of growth rings on the shells.

examination of these shells by a person trained in the aspect of growth
rings can reveal the age of the clam and the season tDwhich it was

collected.

A sample of 26 Rangia cuneata'and 11 Rangia flexuosa were

analyzed in an attempt to gain some knowledge of the season in. which the
clams were gathered, and thereby indicate the seasons in which the sites
were occupied.

Since the sample was so small, no conclusive argument was

made; however, a noticeable trend was observed.

Results of the analysis

are shown in Table 2.

As Table 2 shows, Rangia cuneata seems to have been gathered during the

One must remember that the sample is small, and that the

clams used for this procedure were (with the exception of two from the bulk
matrix) from the destroyed part of the midden and were gathered from the
remains of that midden.

The flexuosa seem to have a fairly obvious affilia­

tion with the late period.

Here again no conclusive evidence is available.

It would be very interesting to see which lens or lenses produced the
rlexuosa.

If this could be established, then a comparison would be made

with other fauna from the two lenses and conclusions could be drawn about

o

the affect of the higher salinity which is indicated by Rangia flexuosa. '

41 BO 79 appears to represent an important era in the development of Texas
Gulf Coastal culture.

The time of occupation can be fixed in a general way

from the ceramics collected.

For instance, grog-tempering did not come into

use along the Texas Coast until about 1000 AD.

Since nO'decorated ware were

found, it can be assumed that the undecorated, grog-tempered ware represents
an earlier assemblage than decorated ware found elsewhere.

This seems to be

the case in every instance where carbon dates have been taken.

Although

the precise period when grog-tempering came into use in the survey area is
unknown, it can be fairly

t

~egitimately

concluded that grog-tempered ware was

introduced into the area soon after its appearance farther north on the
coast.

However, no conclusive'information can be provided until a careful

excavation is carried out and more sophisticated dating methods are applied
in conjunction with the basic ceramic chronology.

The apparent shifts in subsistence patterns are even more diagnostic as
far as culture development is concerned.

This apparent shift raises many

questions which are pertinent to the overall cultural background of the
area.

A comparative study of faunal material from 41 BO 79, with material

from sites both up and down the coast, could prove to be invaluable.

The

information from such a study would not only produce an accurate picture
of general changes in economy and environment in the region, but would also
lay the foundation from which numerous studies involving fields dealing with
lithic technology, movement changes in an annuar round, and a host of other
significant culture traits could be made.

These fields are presently subject

Survey Procedure

The depth and areal extent of the site were delineated by measuring the
exposed portion of the site, and by auger borings.

Very little material was

recovered during the surface collection, and the site is of the temporary
gathering type.

Sixteen grog-tempered potsherds were found in one area, but

all may represent pieces of one large sherd which was crushed.

Noother

surface artifcats were found, although large quantities of burned shell and
charcoal indicate the presence of a hearth.
.'

J'

Analysis and Recommendation

The sherds from 49 BO 81 are not significant in tnemselves, although
they are useful as an indicator of what the site may represent.

The grog-

tempered ware (which appeared around 1000 AD) is the only clue to the age of
the site.

The sparcity of artificats of sites in the area is typical of many

sites near the Gulf Coast.

Nonetheless, these sites are fundamental in under­

standing the cultural background of the people who inhabited the area.

Since virtually nothing is known about the activities or economics present
during occupation of the site, it would be beneficial to test the site through
an excavation.

In the event of possible site destruction, it is recommended

that two or more stratigraphic test pits be excavated.

This type of test

would provide the necessary data for an evaluation of economics, technology,
and possibly some aspects of seasonality.

Analysis and Recommendation

41 BO 84 represents a much more massive shell midden than 41 BO 83 or
41 BO 82.

This, coupled with the occurrence of artifacts on the surface,

indicates that somewhat different activities may have taken place.

The

surface collection consists of sandy paste ceramics, asphaltum, rangia
shells, and intensely burned oyster shell.

Of particular interest is the

occurrence of rangia cuneata shells, which is indicative of a moderate
salinity level.

Since river water in the vicinity of the site is high due

to the close proximity of the Gulf, the rangia may have been brought in as
food.

This indicates that gathering of oysters was not of primary concern,

since the inhabitants brought food to the site.

92 is a very interesting site inasmuch as its midden structure and

The thin shell lenses indicate that the

duration of the occupation was probably fairly short.

This aspect is of

interest since data obtained from the lens would be from one occupation.
A problem in the excavation of continuous thick middens is that arbitrary
levels must be used in order to obtain some knowledge of the stratigraphic

The structure of the midden is of primary concern when making an evaluation
of a shell midden.

Archeological disciplines on the subject are in a rather
j

embryonic stage of development in the Gulf Coast.

However, some research

has been done and there is a fairly sizeable accumulation of data on this
subject.

41 BO 94 seems to represent a midden structure which has not

been tested and it is this feature which makes the site valuable.

No

surface artifacts were found, but this can be attributed to the fact that
only a small amount of material from the midden is exposed.

The information

yielded through an investigation of the site would be of particular interest
due to its proximity to other types of shell midden structures in the area.
For this reason, it is recommended that an archeological salvage operation
of 41 BO 94 be initiated in the event of possible destruction of the site.

approximately 8 km due north of the Gulf of Mexico.

Site Description

41 BO 95 is the largest shell midden found during the

41 BO 95 appears to represent a "base campI! type of site.

The basis on

which this hypothesis is drawn is the unusually large continuous midden.
The midden itself is large enough to accommodate a much larger population
than any of the other sites in the area.

Since a site of this type has not been tested, knowledge of exact functions
and activities which took place at the site during its occupatiqn are
unknown.

For this reason, it is recommended that a thorough archeological

investigation of 41 BO 95 be undertaken in the event of possible site
destruction.

Analysis and Recommendation

41 BO 97 is apparently smaller than a base camp but larger than a gathering

The occurrence of the Rangia cuneata shells at the bottom of the lens is
of some interest.

In the case of 41 BO 96, Rangia cuneata shells were

almost entirely concentrated in the upper portions of the midden.

There is

presently no explanation as to why the shells are arranged in this fashion.
We may speculate, in a very general manner, that this is due to one of two
causes - (1) Indians in the area were exploiting Rangia cuneata beds rather
than oyster beds, or (2) the environment underwent a substantial change,
making conditions more favorable· for Rangia development than for oyster
during a certain period of time.
