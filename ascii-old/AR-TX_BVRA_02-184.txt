ABSTRACT
A Phase I archaeological survey of two water line segments (4.51 miles) in central
Walker County, Texas was performed on October 11, 2007 by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) under Texas Antiquities Permit 4675 with William E. Moore the
Principal Investigator and Edward P. Baxter the Project Archaeologist. In all, 8.2 acres
were examined. No archaeological sites (prehistoric or historic) were found, and no
artifacts were collected. It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed without
further consultation with the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Copies of the report are
on file at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division, the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Walker County Special Utility District
(SUD), and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The Walker County SUD proposes to upgrade its water distribution system
by upgrading the Pierce Road Plant high service pumps to a greater capacity. In
addition, an existing three-inch waterline along O’Bannon Ranch Road will be
replaced with a new eight-inch waterline. An existing three-inch waterline along
Armadillo Road will be replaced with a new eight-inch waterline, and an existing
four-inch waterline along FM 1791 will be replaced with a new-eight inch waterline.
The general location of the project area is depicted in Figure 1. Two areas, as
outlined in the antiquities permit, are the subjects of this report. They are a 1.19
mile segment that parallels O’Bannon Road (Area 1) and a 3.32 mile segment
along Farm-to-Market Road 1791 in which an existing four-inch waterline will be
replaced with an eight-inch waterline (Area 2). Area 1 is depicted in Figure 2, and
Area 2 is depicted in Figure 3. The waterline in both areas will be placed in a
trench 24 inches wide and beneath thirty-six inches of cover.
Walker County is in an area that contains numerous prehistoric and historic
archaeological sites. Because of the potential for significant sites in the project
area, a survey by a professional archaeologist prior to construction was requested
by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) under Rural Water Assistance
Fund (RWAF) project number 21585. This project falls under the purview of the
THC as the Walker County SUD is considered to be a political subdivision of the
State of Texas.
In order to fulfill this requirement, the Walker County SUD
contracted with BVRA to perform this assessment. A research design was
submitted to the Texas Historical Commission, and Texas Antiquities Permit
number 4675 was issued to BVRA with William E. Moore the Principal Investigator.
The project number assigned by BVRA is 07-20. The area investigated is depicted
on two 7.5’ USGS topographic maps. They are Galilee (3095-313) and Pine Prairie
(3095-341).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Walker County is located within the Austroriparian biotic province as defined
by Blair (1950) and includes the Gulf coastal plain from the Atlantic Ocean to
eastern Texas. The western boundary of this province in Texas is approximated by
a line running north from western Harris County to western Red River County. The
western boundary of the Austroriparian is also the western boundary of the main
body of the pine and hardwood forests of the eastern Gulf coastal plain (Blair
1950:99). According to Thornthwaite (1948), these forests are limited on the west
by available moisture.
Flora
The Project Area is located within the loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, and
upland hardwood plant community as defined by the United States Forest Service
for the four National Forests in East Texas. According to Ippolito (1983:6-7), the
major forest cover types in this community include loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, slash
pine, post oak, southern red oak, white oak, black oak, blackjack oak, black gum,
sweet gum, American elm, red maple, hickories, and beech. Approximately 70
percent of East Texas is currently occupied by the Piney Woods with Post Oak
Savannah and Blackland Prairie in the rest of the region (Boyd and Howard
1988:4). Keller (1974:139-156) believes that deciduous trees may have been more
numerous during most of the Holocene and were probably more important
resources to prehistoric populations than the modern flora would suggest.
Fauna
The vertebrate fauna of the Austroriparian is considered typical of that to the
east. Blair (1950:99) states that at least 47 species of mammals occur or have
occurred there in recent times. Known types include at least 29 species of snakes,
10 lizards, 2 land turtles, 17 anurans, and 18 urodeles. Ippolito (1983:11) states
that there is an inadequate sample of faunal material for the area in an
archaeological context. Therefore, assumptions concerning prehistoric exploitation
of animals must be based on historical accounts and current populations.

5

A study by Keller (1974:78-81) of the paleoecology of the middle Neches
region lists those mammals most likely to have been hunted in the area. They are
Whitetail deer, Cottontail rabbit, Swamp rabbit, Grey squirrel, Fox squirrel, Flying
squirrel, Raccoon, Opossum, Red fox, Grey fox, Woodchuck, Bobcat, Spotted
skunk, Striped skunk, Mink, Otter, Long-tailed weasel, and Muskrat. According to
Ippolito (1983:11), this list excludes many species of birds, especially migratory
fowl, and fish that can still be found in the area. Species not found in the area
today include Black bear, beaver, and wild turkey. These were once numerous but
were eradicated by uncontrolled hunting and timber harvesting that irreparably
altered their habitats.
Climate
The following climatic data were taken from McClintock et al. (1979). The
weather in Walker County consists of hot summers and cool winters. An
occasional cold front may cause temperatures to drop below freezing, sometimes
quite suddenly. The average winter temperature is 51 degrees Fahrenheit with an
average daily minimum of 41 degrees. In summer, the average is 82 degrees with
an average daily maximum of 94 degrees. The growing season has 234 days
above freezing each year. Prevailing winds are from the south-southeast. Rainfall
is uniformly distributed throughout the year, and snowfall is rare.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Although several significant studies involving prehistoric and historic sites
have been conducted in Walker County, most of the site data are based on survey
level studies with little or no subsurface testing. As a result, much of the
information for Walker County is taken from projects in surrounding areas such as
Lake Livingston in Polk and San Jacinto counties (McClurkan 1968; Ensor and
Carlson 1988); Lake Conroe in Montgomery County (McNatt 1978; Shafer 1968;
Shafer and Stearns 1975); Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, Angelina, and Sabine
National Forests (Fields 1979); Davy Crockett National Forest (Bond and Moore
1980); Lake Creek Reservoir (Bement et al. 1987); and the Gibbons Creek Mine in
Grimes County (Rogers 1993, 1994, 1995). Several overviews have been
published which provide valuable data for Walker County and vicinity. These are
Indians of the Upper Texas Coast by Aten (1983), Comments on Woodland
Cultures of East Texas by Shafer (1975), and An Overview of the Archaeology of
East Texas by Story (1981).
More recently, five studies have been published which are worthy of
mention. These are Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning
Document compiled by the Department of Antiquities Protection (Kenmotsu and
Perttula (1993); a dissertation by Roger G. Moore (1995) Ph.D. entitled The Mossy
Grove Model of Long-Term Forager-Collector Adaptations in Inland Southeast
Texas; Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society which reviews
the current state of Archeology in Texas and contains a chapter devoted to
Southeast Texas (Patterson 1995); an archaeological study by the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department at the Huntsville Fish Hatchery (Davis et al. 1994:20-33);
and a survey for the Trinity River Authority by Moore Archeological Consulting
(Moore and Moore 1996:6-12).
The work by Moore Archeological Consulting (Moore and Moore 1996) is
particularly noteworthy because of the database created from encoding site data for
all known sites in Walker County at the time of this project. This database,
presented in Moore and Moore (1995) was an attempt to define settlement rules
specific to Walker County through the application of an empirical analysis crosstabulating site data with environmental variables and was based, as stated above,
on the computerization of data from all of the existing TARL site records for the
county. A total of 181 sites were used for this study; however the analyses utilized
only those sites with prehistoric components since the sample size for historic sites
is inadequate and the settlement criteria for historic sites location are much different
and currently more ambiguous than for prehistoric sites. This study found that
prehistoric sites seem to be found throughout the county where suitable landforms
(sandy ridges and knolls) exist in close proximity to dependable water sources.
The only known large concentrations of prehistoric sites are the result of large area
surveys. Single sites along major drainages should not be interpreted as sparse
use of an area; rather, these sites were most likely recorded by individuals with
restricted access to larger areas.

7

An example of this is the privately funded study by William E. Moore (1976)
in the 1970s. Moore drove much of the county and recorded sites observed in road
cuts and through personal communication with local landowners and collectors. In
all, 36 sites scattered throughout the county were recorded. At the time, this
number represented 77% of the known sites in Walker County. This study
recorded two sites on McGary Creek, the major drainage in the current project
area. Site 41WA60 is located on a sand hill about 30 feet above the east bank of
Mack Branch of McGary Creek. A shovel test revealed two distinct mantles of sand
overlying a clay substratum. The upper four inches of sand contained recent
historic materials (glass, pottery, and metal). In the next layer (also about four
inches), 1 plain body sherd, 3 dart points, and 2 biface failures were found. No
artifacts were found in the clay. Site 41WA61 is located on a sand hill on the west
side of McGary Creek at an elevation of about 20 feet. One shovel test in a sandy
mantle about six inches in thickness contained a large number of pebbles. Several
flakes were observed on the surface. This landform appears to be an excellent
location for a significant site.
Chronometric dates for inland Southeast Texas are rare. Many sites in this
area have been assigned to cultural periods by other means such as cross-dating
artifacts with similar types from sites in other areas where absolute dates have
been obtained.
Professional archaeologists have formally tested only six prehistoric sites in
Walker County. These are 41WA82 (McNatt 1978), 41WA97 (Boyd and Howard
1988), 41WA105 and 41WA108 (Davis et al. 1994), 41WA185 (Gaddus and Fields
1997), and 41WA218 (Kingsborough and Mangum 2000).
The Kaygal site (41WA82) was tested by Texas A&M University in 1977
(McNatt 1978) and represents the first reported subsurface investigation of a
prehistoric site in Walker County. Based on the association of sandy paste
ceramics with contracting stem dart points, the site was assigned to the Early
Ceramic Period (200 B.C. - A.D. 900). One contracting stem arrow point fragment
may indicate a Late Ceramic Period occupation (A.D. 900 - A.D. 1700). The
excavators state that additional work at this site will not yield new information
regarding the prehistoric life ways of the region. Therefore, mitigation was not
recommended.
Site 41WA97, located in the Sam Houston National Forest, was tested by
Prewitt & Associates, Inc. in 1988 (Boyd and Howard 1988). This investigation
revealed a multi-component site containing Early and Late Ceramic period
occupations. Due to extensive bioturbation and a lack of features and natural or
cultural stratification, it was not possible to separate the components into discrete
analytical units. Therefore, no further work was warranted.

8

Site 41WA105 (Davis et al. 1994) on a high sandy terrace overlooking
Harmon Creek was tested by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in 1989.
Backhoe trenching and hand excavation encountered cultural deposits to a depth of
three meters and identified Late Ceramic, possible Early Ceramic, and Archaic
occupations in a relatively stratified sequence. Calculating the recovery from those
units where volumetric control was maintained, the site has a composite lithic
artifact density of 31 specimens per cubic meter (Davis et al. 1994:59). The
prehistoric component is buried in sandy sediments and is represented by
quantities of debitage (chert, quartzite, and silicified wood); arrow points, dart
points, and other chipped stone tools; sandy paste and tempered ceramic sherds;
burned nut shell; and ground and pecked stone artifacts (Davis et al. 1994:52-59).
One feature was encountered; a grouping of sandstone rocks that are described by
the authors (Davis et al. 1994:61) as "a complete nut processing and milling tool
kit." Site 41WA105 was judged to be eligible for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places under Criterion D: the property may be likely to yield
information important in prehistory (United States Department of the Interior
1982:1).
Site 41WA108 (Davis et al. 1994) is a prehistoric/historic site on a high
alluvial terrace approximately ten meters above Harmon Creek was tested by the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in 1989. Due to the low density of cultural
resource materials and lack of diagnostic materials or features, the site was not
considered significant (Davis et al. 1994:69).
Site 41WA185 was tested by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. (Gaddus and Fields
1997) in 1996. Diagnostic artifacts, four radiocarbon dates, and vertical distribution
of artifacts suggest that the site contains two primary components; early and middle
Late Prehistoric period and Woodland-Late Prehistoric transition. Because these
components are isolable, and because they contain sufficient artifacts to permit
interpretation, the site has the capacity to yield important information regarding the
prehistory of the Walker County area. Therefore, the site was recommended for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places and designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (Gaddus and Fields 1996:v).
Site 41WA218 was tested under the supervision of Walter D. Kingsborough
of the National Forest and Grasslands office in Lufkin in March 2000 using
volunteer labor. This project is one of the largest conducted in the area with 40
cubic meters of earth being excavated to a depth of 3.36 meters. Over 6000
artifacts were recovered including a number of diagnostic points in a chronologically
stratified archeological deposit that reflects relatively little turbative mixing. Only
arrow points were found in the upper levels with a clear separation between them
and dart points. At 2.20 meters a gray chert Bulverde point was recovered, and a
non-diagnostic scraper was found at 2.60 meters. Flakes were found at 3.36
meters. No historic material below the root matte, and no plow zone were
encountered (Walter D. Kingsborough, personal communication). The report is still
in draft form.

METHODS
Pre-field Tasks
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator checked the site records
at the TARL on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin for the presence of
previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. A review of the
topographic maps and he soil survey for Walker County helped the Principal
Investigator identify areas that seemed most likely to contain archaeological sites.
Field Tasks
Both areas were walked, and shovel tests were dug where appropriate with
an emphasis on terraces and high ground. Each test was dug by hand, and the
excavated dirt was screened using ¼” hardware cloth. A shovel test log was
maintained in the field (Appendix I), and the project was documented through field
notes and digital photographs. Shovel tests were excavated to clay when possible.
In all, 11 tests were excavated. Eight tests were dug through sandy soil and
terminated when clay or rock was encountered. These tests were dug to depths
varying from 20 to 100 cm. Three tests were dug through clay at or near the
surface and were terminated at 10 cm or less. Area 1 (2400 feet) was examined
through a surface inspection and six shovel tests. Cut banks along the road offered
good visibility. Area 2 (3500 feet) was examined through a surface inspection and
five shovel tests. The area of deep sand was less than 1000 feet long; therefore
the shovel tests excavated in this segment were within the range of 16 tests per
one mile. In addition, the cut bank in this area along Farm-to-Market Road 1791
offered excellent visibility. The location of shovel tests in Area 1 appears in Figure
2, and the location of shovel tests in Area 2 appears in Figure 3.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The archival research indicated no previously recorded archaeological sites
in the project area, and no major surveys have been conducted in the vicinity. No
prehistoric sites were found through surface inspection or shovel testing, and no
historic sites greater than 50 years of age were observed. Overall, the project area
consisted of sandy soils that varied in depth from 20 to 100 cm before encountering
clay or rock and clay at or near the surface. The survey was performed in
according with the Minimum Survey Standards as published by the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division.
Area 1 is a 1.19 mile segment that is on private property and parallels the
north and east sides of O’Bannon Road (Figure 3). At the time of this survey, this
area was wooded in some areas and cleared and disturbed in other areas. At one
point, the water line passed through a yard of a residence. The six shovel tests
encountered shallow sandy soils overlying clay and rock between 20 cm and 50
cm. Shovel Test 5 was dug on top of a high hill. According to the soil survey for
Walker County (McClintock et al. 1979:Sheet 25), the soil in this area is Elmina
association, gently undulating (11). This is deep loamy sand on upland interstream divides. On the south side of the tributary shovel tests 3 and 4 were dug in
Falba fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (13). This is a moderately deep soil
on convex uplands. There are two reasons that may account for a lack of cultural
materials in this area even though the water line traverses a high sandy ridge
overlooking a creek. These are the shallow nature of the soils and the fact that the
nearest water is the upper reaches of a creek, a stream that probably did not
contain water throughout the year. Figure 3 depicts a portion of this area that has
been cleared.
Area 2 is a 3.32 mile segment that is on private property and parallels the
north side of Farm-to-Market Road 1791 (Figure 4). There is only one high
probability area in this segment of the proposed water line, the crossing of White
Oak Creek. At the time of this survey, the east and west banks of the creek were
thickly wooded near the creek and less wooded away from the creek. On the west
bank of the creek, the proposed water line passes through well-maintained lawns
associated with residences. Here the soils were shallow, being terminated at less
than 10 cm before encountering clay. According to the soil survey for Walker
County (McClintock et al. 1979:Sheet 44), the soils in this area are referred to as
Ferris-Annona-Houston Black (3). These are deep loamy and clayey soils found on
uplands. The surface layer is firm clay about six inches thick. On the east bank of
the creek the soils on the toe slope were shallow at less than 10 cm above clay. On
the slope and top of the hill on the west bank the soils were deeper, as two shovel
tests were dug to 80 cm and 100 cm before encountering clay. The soils in this
area are depicted on Sheet 44 of the soil survey as one of two soil types. These are
Depcor-Huntsburg association, gently undulating (9) and Depcor-Huntsburg-Gunter
association, gently rolling (10). Both are loamy soils found on side slopes and
ridges of upland divides.

11

Although two shovel tests were dug through deep sandy soils in this area,
no cultural materials were encountered. This is probably due to the fact that the
area tested overlooks the upper reaches of White Oak Creek, a stream that
probably did not contain water throughout the year in this area. Figure 4 depicts
the creek showing the thick vegetation on either bank.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Since no archaeological sites were found in the project area, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed in this area as planned
without further consultation with the Texas Historical Commission. Should
significant cultural deposits be found in the project area, all construction must cease
until the situation can be evaluated by the THC in consultation with the Walker
County SUD and BVRA. Also, if the route of the water line is changed, the THC
must be notified as this may require additional survey. This survey was performed
in accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the THC.
