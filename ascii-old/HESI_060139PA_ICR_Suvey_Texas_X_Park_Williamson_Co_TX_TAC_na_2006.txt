MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Texas X Park is proposing to develop 201 acres (ac) (81 hectares [ha]) into a privately
owned all-terrain vehicle (ATV) and mixed sports park, in Williamson County, Texas. Although
the proposed Texas X Park Project Area is located entirely on private property, the project will
require a Section 404 Permit under the Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1972, as amended, for
authorization of impacts to jurisdictional “waters of the US.” The portions of the overall
development within the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) therefore also
fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended.
To meet the requirements of Section 106 of the NHPA, Texas X Park contracted with
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to conduct an intensive cultural resources
survey of areas related to potential Section 404 permitting within the proposed Project Area.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were located within areas
that might be subject to Section 404 permit actions, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Typically, USACE jurisdiction is
limited to the high-water mark of river/creek/drainage channels or to adjacent wetlands.
However, under Section 106, the USACE may extend its regulatory purview regarding potential
cultural resources impacts beyond the strict limits of Section 404 jurisdiction to include certain
areas adjacent to jurisdictional limits and to areas beyond if the Section 404 regulatory action is
necessary to facilitate development actions beyond the strict limits of jurisdiction. In many
cases, this extension of purview includes the first terrace above stream channels, where
defined, but may extend a prescribed distance from the stream if the terrace is not defined. The
generally low-lying nature of the proposed Project Area did not always afford clearly defined first
terraces. As such, for the purposes of this project, the areas for USACE Section 106 purview
were extended to include the delineated “waters of the US” as well as a 500-foot (ft) (152-meter
[m]) zone along each delineated channel. The USACE Section 106 purview areas investigated
totaled 108 ac (44 ha).
On 15 August 2006, Mr. Reign Clark, project archeologist, and Mr. Michael Mudd and
Mr. Jared Wiersema, field technicians, under the direction of Ms. Marie J. Archambeault,
Principal Investigator, completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the USACE Section 106
purview areas within the Project Area. This included intensive surface inspection and
subsurface shovel tests within each of the Section 106 purview areas.

Management Summary

Archival research, conducted prior to fieldwork, indicated 2 previously recorded sites
(41WM269 and 41WM1099) and 1 historic cemetery (Bagdad Cemetery) located within 1 mile
(mi) (1.2 kilometers [km]) of the Project Area. Site 41WM269 is a historic township, and site
41WM1099 is a historic dump/prehistoric campsite. Additionally, at least 2 cultural resources
surveys have been conducted within a 1-mi (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area.
The survey of the USACE Section 106 purview areas within the Project Area resulted in
entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the
investigated areas or within any of the 36 excavated shovel tests. In general, the majority of the
USACE Section 106 purview areas contained shallow, argillic clay soils with a decreased
potential to contain subsurface cultural deposits.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the USACE Section
106 purview areas within the Project Area, as well as the low potential for deeply buried,
stratified cultural deposits within the majority of the areas, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
proposed Texas X Park will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources within the
USACE Section 106 purview areas and that no further investigations are warranted at these
locations.
Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the
undertaking.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Texas X Park is proposing to develop 201 acres (ac) (81 hectares [ha]) into a privately
owned all-terrain vehicle (ATV) and mixed sports park, in Williamson County, Texas. Although
the proposed Texas X Park Project Area is located entirely on private property, the project will
require a Section 404 Permit under the Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1972, as amended, for
authorization of impacts to jurisdictional “waters of the US”; therefore, the areas of the project
within the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) also fall under the
jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended.
To meet the requirements of Section 106 of the NHPA, Texas X Park contracted with
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to conduct an intensive cultural resources
survey of areas related to potential Section 404 permitting within the proposed Project Area.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were located within areas

Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) for an area of this size require the
excavation of 36 shovel tests. The Horizon field crew met the minimum number of shovel tests
required by excavating 36 shovel tests within the USACE Section 106 purview.
Archival research, conducted prior to fieldwork, indicated 2 previously recorded sites
(41WM269 and 41WM1099) and 1 historic cemetery (Bagdad Cemetery) located within 1 mile
(mi) (1.2 kilometers [km]) of the Project Area. Site 41WM269 is a historic township, and site
41WM1099 is a historic dump/prehistoric campsite. Additionally, at least 2 cultural resources
surveys have been conducted within a 1-mi (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area.
The survey of the USACE Section 106 purview areas within the Project Area resulted in
entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the
investigated areas or within any of the 36 excavated shovel tests. In general, the majority of the
USACE Section 106 purview areas contained shallow, argillic clay soils with a decreased
potential to contain subsurface cultural deposits.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the USACE Section
106 purview areas within the Project Area, as well as the low potential for deeply buried,
stratified cultural deposits within the majority of the areas, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
proposed Texas X Park will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources within the
USACE Section 106 purview areas and that no further investigations are warranted at these
locations.
Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the
undertaking.

Williamson County, Texas

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The Texas X Park’s proposed Project Area is located off of Bagdad Road west of
Leander in southwest Williamson County, Texas. The Project Area is situated on the Nameless,
Texas (1986) US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5’ Topographic Quadrangle. Photographs of the
USACE Section 106 purview areas within the Project Area are presented in Figures 3 to 13.

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in the Lampasas Cut Plain Physiographic Region
(Fenneman 1938). This region is underlain by the same type of rocks that underlies the
Edwards Plateau; however, it exhibits different characteristics. This dissected plain has many
summits and mesas with deeply cut valleys. The flat-topped mesas are capped with hard
limestones, the edges of which are margined by typical rim-rock vegetation.
Williamson County is situated in the Brazos River Basin. The Project Area is underlain
by the Edwards Aquifer. The North Fork of Brushy Creek is the major waterway that is
connected to the USACE jurisdictional areas within the Project Area. Brushy Creek feeds into
Little River in Milam County, east of the Project Area. Ultimately, Little River feeds into the
Brazos River at the border of Milam and Robertson counties. A dam was built in the 1960s by
the USDA, Soil Conservation Service (Now the Natural Resources Conservation Service) along
the North Fork of Brushy Creek and created Devine Lake in the southeastern corner of the
Project Area. The 60-ac (24-ha) lake is a part of the City of Leander’s Devine Lake Park, which
is located on the southern end of the Devine Lake.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The geological formation beneath the Project Area is a thick sequence of Cretaceousage, sedimentary rock strata. Specifically, the Project Area is underlain by the Lower
Cretaceous-age Fredericksburg Group, which is primarily composed of limestones and marls
(Barnes 1974). One soil association is mapped for the Project Area. Denton-Eckrant-Doss soil
association is found on uplands and is characterized by moderately deep, shallow and very
shallow, calcareous clayey, cobbly, and stony soils formed in indurated, fractured limestone or
limy earths (Werchan and Coker 1983). Four soil types are mapped for this area: Denton silty

clay, 1 to 3% slopes; Doss silty clay, 1 to 5% slopes; Fairlie clay, 0 to 1% slopes; and Tinn clay,
frequently flooded.
The Denton silty clay, 1 to 3% slopes, soil series occurs in shallow valleys and narrow
drainageways on uplands. It consists of dark brown silty clay to a depth of 84 centimeters (cm)
(33 inches [in]), followed by very pale brown silty clay loam to a depth of 91 cm (36 in). The
underlying materials are fractured limestone and limy material.
The Doss silty clay, 1 to 5% slopes, soil series is characterized by gently sloping soils on
uplands. A typical profile consists of a surface layer of dark grayish-brown silty clay to a depth
of 23 cm (9 in) with a subsoil of brown silty clay loam to a depth of 48 cm (19 in). The
underlying material is weakly cemented limy earth.
The Fairlie clay, 0 to 1% slopes, soil series is characterized by nearly level soils on
broad plateaus, depressed areas near headwaters, and shallow valleys on uplands. A
representative profile consists of dark gray clay to a depth of 91 cm (36 in), underlain by gray
clay to a depth of 117 cm (46 in). The underlying material to a depth of 140 cm (55 in) is weakly
cemented limestone.
The Tinn clay, frequently flooded, soil series is situated in bottomlands. A representative
profile is dark gray clay to a depth of 147 cm (58 in), underlain by grayish brown to a depth of
196 cm (77 in). Beneath that is a mixture of gravel, sand, and clay to a depth of 203 cm (80 in).

CLIMATE

Williamson County is located within the north-central Texas climatic division. The
modern climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. On
average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas manifest regional
variations with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and
mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and
Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate fluctuates from subtropical humid to subtropical
subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81 cm (32 in) and temperature averages 19º
Celsius (C) (67º Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36º C (96º F) in August (the warmest
month) to 15º C (59º F) in January (the coldest month).

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is situated within the Cross-Timbers and Prairies Ecological Region.
The Cross Timbers and Prairies region is a transitional area for many plants and animals whose
ranges extend northward into the Great Plains or eastward into the forests. The region has
extensive grasslands, live oak, and juniper. Historical records indicate much of this region
existed as a grassland or open live oak savannah that supported herds of bison and other
herbivores dependent on the tall grasses that dominated the region. Today the region supports
agricultural croplands and livestock. Fauna in the region include white-tailed deer, Rio Grande
turkey, bobwhite quail, mourning doves, fox squirrels, rabbits, and a variety of non-game wildlife
species.

Williamson County, Texas

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within Prewitt’s (1981; 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region that spans from Uvalde to Cleburne, Texas. The Central Texas archeological record is
divided into a 4 component chronological sequence: PaleoIndian, 11,500 to 8800 B.P.; Archaic,
8800 to 1200 B.P.); Late Prehistoric, 1200 to 350 B.P.; and Historic, 350 B.P. to present (Collins
1995).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,500 TO 8800 B.P.)

The earliest evidence for human activity in Central Texas is represented by the
PaleoIndian period. The PaleoIndian period began during the Late Pleistocene, a time when
climatic changes caused the extinction of several forms of large fauna. Investigations at sites
such as the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault suggest the PaleoIndian diet relied
on a range of flora and fauna, which included both large fauna such as mammoth, bison, and
horse, as well as smaller fauna such as water turtles, land tortoises, alligator, mice, badger, and
raccoon (Collins 1995:381). The most common projectile points used during this period were
the lanceolate forms, which were fluted during the Early PaleoIndian period and unfluted during
the Late PaleoIndian period. Settlement patterns were largely nomadic with small populations
traveling to resource rich environs (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1981; Collins 1995).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8800 TO 1200 B.P.)

The Archaic period is subdivided into 3 subperiods: Early (8800 to 6000 B.P), Middle
(6000 to 4000 B.P.), and Late (4000 to 1200 B.P) (Collins 1995). With the extinction of
Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes, the Archaic period witnessed the intensification of
warming and drying trends throughout North America. Lithic technology diversified and hunting
and gathering continued, with a larger reliance on smaller game and wild plants (Prewitt 1981;
Collins 1995). The Early Archaic period tool kit included project point styles such as Angostura,
Early Split Stem, and Martindale-Uvalde; grinding and hammerstones; and unifacial and bifacial
chipped stone (Collins 1995). The Middle Archaic period can be further subdivided as
technological shifts, environmental conditions, and subsistence patterns change during this
period. The early Middle Archaic period is characterized by thin, triangular bifaces, probably as
a result of a specialized bison-hunting weaponry (Johnson and Goode 1994; Collins 1994;
1995). Later in the Middle Archaic period, more xeric conditions return; bison disappear from
the archeological record; burned rock middens, in which xerophytes such as sotol are cooked,

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

appear; and thicker, narrow blades are used (Johnson and Goode 1994; Collins 1995). The
Late Archaic period is characterized by a climatic shift towards more mesic conditions and a
continuation of Middle Archaic subsistence technology. In chronological order, characteristic
projectile points include Bulverde, Pedernales, Kinney, Lange, Marshall, Williams, Marcos,
Montell, Castroville, Ensor, Frio, Fairland, and Darl (Prewitt 1981; Collins 1995). Large
cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic and may reflect the establishment of
territories and subsistence schedules (Prewitt 1981; Story 1985:49; Black 1989:30; Black and
McGraw 1985). Hester (1986) suggests the development of wide-ranging trade contacts may
have also occurred around this time.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

Basic hunting and gathering strategies continue in the Late Prehistoric period, with 2
notable additions, the introduction of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are
recognized within this period: Austin (1200 to 800 B.P) and Toyah (800 to 350 B.P.). The
transition from the atlatl and dart to the bow and arrow and arrowpoints occurred during the
Austin phase. Additionally, there was a shift from open to protected (rockshelter) sites (Prewitt
1981; Black 1989; Collins 1995). The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes
in technology. These include pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area), large, thin
bifaces, Perdiz arrow points, and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). The Toyah
phase may have witnessed the addition of maize horticulture or the importation of maize
through trade (Prewitt 1981).

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

In Central Texas, the Historic period begins with the clash of indigenous cultures and the
arrival of Europeans in the late 17th to early 18th centuries (Collins 1995). Prior to the arrival of
the Europeans, displaced native groups from Mexico and southern Texas, specifically the
Apache, began moving into Central Texas to escape Spanish oppression. The Apache utilized
horses, stolen from the Spanish, to terrorize native groups in the region, forcing some to flee
(Newcomb 1993: 2). Thus, the accounts gathered by first Europeans into the region document
the declination of native populations resulting from the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids
of the Apache, and the diseases that swept through the region prior to the physical presence of
Europeans. Their accounts represent a period of drastic cultural change (Collins 1995).
Beginning about 1730 and ended about 1800, the mission systems began to fail (Hester 1989;
Collins 1995). Several historic tribes occupied parts of what would become Williamson County,
including the Tonkawas, Lipan Apaches, Comanches, and small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane,
Tawakoni, and Mayeye Indians1.
While Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have traveled through the area in the 16th
century, it was probably first explored by Europeans in the late 17th century, when Capt. Alonso
De León sought a route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas that
would serve as a drier alternative to the more southerly Camino Real. The new route passed

through the area of Williamson County along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River and was
called Camino de Arriba. In 1716, 2 explorers in the Spanish service, Louis Juchereau de St.
Denis and Domingo Ramón, led an expedition that passed through the area and camped on
Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River, naming them respectively Arroyo de las Bendítas
Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier. The San Xavier missions, which were founded in the mid-18th
century and occupied a series of sites along the San Gabriel River, were just over the eastern
border of Williamson County in present-day Milam County, and the area was extensively
explored by the Spanish. During the Mexican period, parts of the county were awarded as land
grants, first to several Mexican families, then as part of Robertson's colony, but no settlement
resulted from these grants.
Anglo settlement began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic
of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835, in an attempt to strengthen the
frontier against Indian attack, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy Creek in
what would become southwestern Williamson County and was named for Capt. John J.
Tumlinson, Jr., the commander of the company of Texas Rangers who garrisoned the post.
The post was abandoned in February of 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the
Mexican invasion. In 1838, the first civilian settlement was established by a Dr. Thomas
Kenney and a party of settlers who built a fort, named Kenney's Fort, on Brushy Creek near the
site of the present-day crossing of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Several other sites on
Brushy Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept white settlement in check, and a
number of the early pioneers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians over the next few years.
In 1842, many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised
settlers to pull back from the frontier. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx
of settlers who came to Texas after its annexation traveled to the frontier along Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel River. By 1848, there were at least 250 settlers in what was then western
Milam County, and in the early months of that year 107 of them signed a petition to organize a
new county. Recognizing that the petitioners needed a seat of local government that was
considerably closer to them than Milam County's, the Texas legislature established Williamson
County on 13 March 1848, naming it for prominent judge and soldier Robert M. Williamson.
Georgetown, the county seat, was laid out during the summer of that year, and the district court
was in session by October. According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a
population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves, living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel. As was common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage
was used to grow corn. On the eve of the Civil War Williamson County had moved beyond the
frontier stage and was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. Cotton was introduced in the
1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in 1860, and it was not an important cash crop for most
farmers. The early settlers had found large herds of wild cattle in the 1840s, and cattle
ranching, both for home consumption and for market, was widespread throughout the county by
1860.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

In order to determine if any previously recorded archeological sites, historic structures,
or cemeteries were documented within or adjacent to any of the USACE jurisdictional areas,
Horizon conducted archival research via the Internet at the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas website (Atlas 2006). This review indicated 2 previously
recorded sites (41WM269 and 41WM1099) and 1 historic cemetery (Bagdad Cemetery) are
located within 1 mi (1.2 km) of the Project Area (Table 1). Additionally, at least 2 cultural
resources surveys have been conducted within a 1-mi (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area. Both
were conducted for the Leander Independent School District. One was conducted in 1998, and
the other was conducted in 2004. The 1998 survey did not identify any cultural resources. The
2004 survey documented 1 site, 41WM1099, which is discussed below.

SITE 41WM269

Located at the intersection of Bagdad Road and Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 2243,
approximately 1 mi (1.2 km) east/southeast of the Project Area, site 41WM269 is the recorded
location for the historic Anglo settlement of Bagdad, Texas. The site consists of a cemetery,
structures, and structural foundations. Bagdad was surveyed in 1854 by Charles Babcock, who
ran an inn in the town that was named for Bagdad, Tennessee, the hometown of an early
settler. A Texas Historic Landmark, Bagdad Cemetery contains burials dating to as early as
1857 (Figures 14 and 15). The earliest known grave is that of John Babcock, Charles
Babcock’s 3-year-old-son (Atlas 2006). Other early notable burials include Civil War veterans
John Haile and Colonel C.C. Mason. Master carpenter Andrew Porter Pickle (1833 to 1908)
built the Pickle-Mason House for his family in 1871. The Pickle-Mason House is recorded as

site 41WM1003, which is located well outside of the 1-mi (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area.
John Frederick Heinatz (1822 to 91) built the Heinatz Homestead, along with an adjoining store
and post office, in the fall of 1850. The house is located 1 block south of FM 2243 on Bagdad
Road and is recorded as a Texas Historic Landmark. The Leander Presbyterian Church,
organized in Bagdad in 1857, is located about 0.25 miles south of the intersection of US
Highway 183 and FM 2243. The Leander United Methodist Church was organized around 1869
in Bagdad and was moved to Leander in 1901. The Church is located on West Street, 1 block
south of FM 2243. The Norton Moses Masonic Lodge was chartered formally in 1871. In 1899,
the Masons moved to Leander and settled where the current landmark is located on 201 Sunny
Drive, about 1 mile south of FM 2243.
John W. Clark recorded the settlement in 1974 as part of an on-going research project
by the University of Texas at Austin (Atlas 2006). Clark recorded the cemetery and about 12
standing structures. He referred to many observed historic ruins spread out over an area of
about 1.0 mi (1.6 km) north to south and 0.25 mi (0.40 km) west to east. The settlement had a
post office from 1855 to 1882 and was a mail stop on the early stage line between Austin and
Lampasas. Bagdad thrived in the 1860s and 1870s, and in 1882 had 2 blacksmith shops, a
hotel, 2 schools, a Masonic lodge, 3 churches, and several stores. That year, however, the
Austin and Northwestern Railroad reached nearby Leander, and the Bagdad post office was
relocated to Leander. Several businesses moved as well. By the turn of the century, Bagdad
was virtually a ghost town. Clark recommended extensive detail survey work to record the
many features within the 115-ac site. NRHP eligibility of site 41WM269 is undetermined (Atlas
2006).

4.2

SITE 41WM1099

Site 41WM1099 was recorded by Michael Nash in 2005 during a cultural resources
survey of a proposed Leander Independent School District Elementary School. The site is
recorded as an ephemeral multicomponent historic/prehistoric dump containing only surficial
artifacts. It was not recommended for further work (Atlas 2006). NRHP eligibility of site
41WM1099 is undetermined.
No properties listed on the NRHP are located within or adjacent to the USACE Section
106 purview areas of the proposed Texas X Park.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew, including Mr. Reign Clark, Project
Archeologist, and Mr. Michael Mudd and Mr. Jared Wiersema, field technicians, under the
direction of Ms. Marie J. Archambeault, Principal Investigator, completed the intensive
pedestrian survey of the USACE Section 106 purview areas within the Project Area on 15
August 2006. This included intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel tests within the
USACE Section 106 purview areas.
Typically, the USACE Section 106 purview areas are limited to the first terrace above the
river/creek/drainage channels. The generally low-lying nature of the proposed Project Area did
not always afford clearly defined first terraces. As such, for the purposes of this project, the
USACE Section 106 purview areas were extended to include the delineated “waters of the US”
as well as a 500-ft (152-m) buffer along each delineated channel.
The TSMASS require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 3 ac for projects measuring
between 101 to 200 ac in size. The total acreage of the USACE Section 106 purview areas is
108 ac (44 ha). According to the TSMASS, a total of 36 shovel tests should be excavated in the
USACE Section 106 purview area. The Horizon field crew met the minimum number of shovel
tests required by excavating 36 shovel tests within the USACE Section 106 purview areas.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate.
The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in
Figure 16. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.
This survey set out to employ a non-collection policy for cultural materials. Nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were to be
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. In the event that any diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points,
ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) were identified in the field, they were to be
collected and placed in resealable plastic bags labeled with relevant provenience information.
No cultural materials were collected during this survey.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the USACE Section 106 purview areas within the proposed Texas X Park
Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the
surface of the investigated USACE Section 106 purview areas or within any of the 36 excavated
shovel tests. In general, the majority of the USACE Section 106 purview areas contained
shallow argillic clay soils with a decreased potential to contain subsurface cultural deposits (see
Figure 8). These soils would have likely confined any cultural materials to shallow or surface
contexts, and would not have facilitated deeply buried, stratified deposits. These shallow argillic
soils are characteristic of the entire Project Area.
Much of the USACE Section 106 purview areas have previously been disturbed.
Ground disturbances within the USACE Section 106 purview areas included dam construction,
berm construction, vegetation clearing, and terracing. Soils from the eastern portion of the
Project Area were used to create the foundation for the dam (see Figures 11 and 12). Soils
near the waterways were pushed toward the waterways, creating earthen berms along the
creeks (see Figure 13). The central portion of the USACE Section 106 purview areas has been
terraced (see Figure 10). Additionally, much of the Project Area outside of the USACE Section
106 purview areas has been terraced since the 1960s.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the USACE Section
106 purview areas within the proposed Texas X Park Project Area, as well as the low potential
for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits in the majority of the areas, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the proposed construction will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources
within the USACE Section 106 purview areas and that no further investigations are warranted at
these locations. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the
undertaking.
