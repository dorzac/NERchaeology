MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This report presents the summary findings for the monitoring of the proposed Nuestra Señora de La
Purísima Concepción del Socorro Mission (41EP38) Covered Metal Booth Project, Socorro, El Paso
County, Texas. Included in this document are the results of the mechanical trenching along the perimeter
of two proposed concrete footprints, Footprint 1 and Footprint 2. The monitoring process followed the work
plan presented to the Texas Historical Commission on 20 February 2019 with concurrence on 8 March
2019.
In consultation with the Texas Historical Commission, the Diocese of El Paso, and Design and Construction
Group, Versar Inc. initiated the project on 23 April 2019 and completed the monitoring and profile
documentation on 24 April 2019. Two rectangular footprints in the plaza/parking lot area south of the
Parish Hall were targeted. The northern-most footprint (Footprint 1) was oriented in a north/south direction
and measured 112 ft. by 14 ft. (4.14 m by 4.27 m; 0.035 acres) in size. The second footprint (Footprint 2)
is 38.5 ft. (11.73 m) south of the first footprint and was oriented in an east/west direction; this footprint
measured 132 ft. by 14 ft. (40.23 m by 4.27 m; 0.042 acres) in size. The APE considered a total of 0.077
acres.
Mechanical excavation started with Footprint 1. Excavations were conducted in layers-the first 12-inches
(30.48 cm) were carefully removed followed by the remaining 12-inches (30.48 cm) to reach a consistent
depth of 24-inches (60.96 cm) below ground surface. Anomalies or changes in soil compaction or texture
were noted when encountered; excavations were temporarily halted while the trench was inspected. Spot
screening of back dirt piles using 1/8-inch hardware mesh was conducted. Profile drawings and photographs
were taken as the trenching was completed. No cultural features, artifacts, or utilities were encountered. An
interim report with summary findings was submitted for review to the THC on 7 May 2019; notice to
proceed with undertaking issued on 9 May 2019.
The monitoring process did not identify any new elements to 41EP38. As no cultural deposits were
encountered, archaeological clearance is recommended for the construction of the two covered booths. If
any cultural materials are exposed during any phase of construction, work at the location should cease and
the Texas Historical Commission should be notified immediately. All documents relating to the monitoring
efforts will be housed at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, Austin, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
Versar, Inc. was contacted by Design and Construction Group, on behalf of the Catholic Diocese of El Paso,
Texas, to conduct archaeological monitoring of mechanical trenching along the perimeter of two proposed
covered booth structures in the parking area/plaza of the Nuestra Señora de La Purísima Concepción del
Socorro Mission (41EP38). This document presents the results of the archaeological monitoring (Figure 1).
The project area is in Block 16, Socorro Grant Tracts 37 and 39 (328 South Nevarez Street). Two
rectangular covered booth structures will be erected in the plaza/parking area south of the Parish Hall; the
north/south structure (Footprint 1) measures 112 ft. by 14 ft. (4.14 m by 4.27 m) in size. The second area
(Footprint 2) is 38.5 ft. (11.73 m) south of the first footprint and was oriented in an east/west direction; this
footprint measured 132 ft. by 14 ft. (40.23 m by 4.27 m) in size (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The proposed
construction effort will provide a covered walkway and permanent infrastructure for church and community
festivals in an open plaza/parking adjacent to the mission (Figure 4).
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is on property owned and maintained by the Catholic Diocese of El
Paso, which covers the Parish Hall, the Rectory (41EP3610), the adjoining Mission Nuestra de la
Concepcion del Socorro, the Shrine, stage, and the attached cemetery. Current impacts target the gravel
plaza/parking lot between the Parish Hall and the church cemetery. An existing 2001 deed covenant,
between the Catholic Diocese and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) requires that the state review
and approve all proposed changes to the building and environs to include ground disturbing activities
through 2031 (Appendix A). The recognition of this covenant, and the proposed impact to the property
which entails the placement of up to 52 support footings, generated the requirement for a Texas Antiquities
Permit and the monitoring effort. As such, the purpose of the monitoring was to observe and document the
undertaking and to identify, recover, and protect/document all prehistoric and historic deposits exposed
during the trenching activities. In all, 1,305.6 ft2 (121.29 m2) were excavated to a depth of 2.0 ft (60.96
cm) below ground surface. No structural elements were exposed and the cemetery south of the APE was
not impacted; no archaeological deposits were encountered.

BACKGROUND: NUESTRA SEÑORA DE LA PURISIMA CONCEPCIÓN
DEL SOCORRO MISSION (41EP38)
Nuestra Señora de la Purisima Concepciόn del Socorro Mission (41EP38) is one of three standing missions
in El Paso County whose construction was a direct result of the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 (Espinosa 1988;
Jenkins 2000). The revolt, which began in the summer of 1680, resulted in the evacuation of ecclesiastic
leaders and associated refugees from the Santa Fe region of New Mexico. The flight southward resulted in
the establishment of refugee settlements that were, in part, integrated with existing Pueblo communitiesincluding the Piro village of Socorro (Gerald 2000). The development of a central place of worship soon
followed as populations became settled, agricultural fields developed, and political status was confirmed.
Originally, Nuestra Señora de la Purisima Concepciόn del Socorro Mission was established near Fabens,
but flooding initiated a move to present day Socorro in 1682/1683 (Gerald 1990). In 1691, Governor Diego
de Vargas gave the name of Missión de Nuestra Señora de la Limpia Concepción de los Piros de Socorro
to the mission (Brown et al. 1995: 88). By 1766, the Socorro Mission was being referred to as La Purísima
Concepción del Socorro. In 1829, flooding on the Rio Grande shifted the river’s course, leaving the towns
of Ysleta, Socorro and San Elizario on the future American side of the Rio Grande river and destroying the
church in Socorro.

The third and current mission was rebuilt in 1843 about one-half of a mile to the west using the vigas of the
original mission church (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Construction exhibited the traditional vernacular style
using cottonwood framing, and adobe/stucco surfacing. The current mission displays a prominent belfry
with a stepped façade reflective of the Spanish influence of the region.
The layout of the mission follows the general cruciform style traditionally found in Europe; however, La
Purisima lacks deep transepts, exhibits a much narrower nave, and has minimal internal supports (Figure
7). In a desert environment which contains limited resources, this style allows for the construction of single
beam roofing frameworks. In addition, the shortened transepts serve as load bearing supports to carry the
weight of the roof. Finally, in keeping with Pueblo tradition, the outer elements of the mission were
plastered with adobe (Parsons 1975).
The associated cemetery is in the southern portion of the church property and was opened on February 11,
1846. In 1964, the mission was added to the Texas Historic Landmarks registry. Between 1980 and 1985,
renovations were carried out to improve and stabilize the mission. During the 1990s and early 2000s smallscale renovations were carried out on the mission/mission grounds (Peterson et al. 1994; Schuetz 1980;
Ward 2015: 3). Anticipated funding for larger renovation projects resulted in the signing of the deed
covenant in 2001.
Previous archaeological investigations carried out by Schuetz (1980), Gerald (1990), Brown et al. (1995),
Camarena-Garces (2002), Mbutu (2002), and Ward (2015) focused on the 1843 Socorro Mission and reflect
the only regimented investigations into the mission and surrounding area. For this project, Schuetz (1980)
and Brown et al. (1995) are most relevant and provide related stratigraphic sequences either overlapping or
adjacent to the project area.

In addition to investigating the areas surrounding the mission proper and the rectory, Shuetz (1980, Figure
2) excavated a trench approximately 40 ft. (12.19 m) south of the mission in an area just northwest of the
current APE. For reference, Brown et al.’s (1995: 91) later work identified this trench as impacting Area C
of the 1995 project map. Designated Trench B, this exploratory trench investigated the possible presence
of an adobe atrium. While the atrium was not present, the trench provided the first subsurface view away
from the mission structure. Trench B was approximately 13 ft. (3.96 m) long, approximately 2.5 ft. (76.20
cm) wide, and reached a depth of 1 ft. (30.48 cm) below ground surface. The brief soil descriptions for
Trench B identified a caliche cap that ranged in depth from ground surface to 5-inches (12.70 cm) below
grade. Underlying the caliche lens was a compact brown loam which was consistently exposed on other
trenches. No artifacts were encountered.
Brown et al. (1995) provides additional information directly related to the proposed APE. Two east/west
oriented trenches were excavated directly in the current APE; Backhoe Trench 33 overlaps with the
northernmost footprint, while Backhoe Trench 34 overlaps with the southernmost footprint (Brown et al.
1995: 89, Figure 24) (Figure 8). Moreover, the results of 1994 ground penetrating radar identified a cluster
of linear anomalies, labeled Area X, in the general vicinity of the APE (Brown et al. 1995) (Figure 9).
Backhoe Trench 33, a 65.7 ft. (20-m) long and 3.33 ft (1.0-m) deep excavation, exposed an area disturbed
by several sewer pipes extending from the north margin of the Parish Hall. The sewer pipes extend south
from the trench to Area X-a suspected buried septic tank; the pipes were exposed approximately 3.33 ft.
(1.0-m) below ground surface.

BACKHOE TRENCH 33
Stratum I was a light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam with gravels that reached a maximum depth of 5inches (15-cm) below ground surface. Underlying this upper deposit was Stratum II, a brown-dark brown
(10YR 4/3) clay silt horizon that reached a maximum depth of 19-inches (50-cm) below ground surface.
Stratum II correlates with the D-horizon. A very dark brown to black (10YR2/1 to 2/2) silty clay extended
from below Stratum II to the base of the trench; Stratum III tentatively correlates to the E-horizon. Modern
sewer pipes were exposed approximately 3.33 ft. (1.0-m) below ground surface. No other cultural materials
were encountered (Brown et al. 1995: 123).
BACKHOE TRENCH 34
Backhoe Trench 34 was placed approximately 10-m south of Backhoe Trench 33. This east/west oriented
trench was positioned parallel to Backhoe Trench 33 and targeted the margin of Area X. The excavation
process was abandoned after a sewer pipe was exposed (Brown et al. 1995: 123)

THE UNDERTAKING
The proposed covered booth construction will cover two rectangular footprints in the plaza/parking area
south of the Parish Hall (Figure 10 and Figure 11). The closest footprint to the Parish Hall is 112 ft by 14
ft (34.14 m by 4.27 m) and is oriented in a north/south direction. The second area is 38.5 ft. (11.73 m) south
of the first proposed booth area and oriented in an east/west direction; the footprint measures 132 ft by 14
ft (40.23 m by 4.27 m) in area. Up to 52 concrete footings will anchor the structures-each footing will
extend approximately 18-inches (45.72 cm) below ground. Subsequent to the trench excavation, the
footings will be installed along the perimeter of the footprint. Mechanical excavations will impact the
outline of the footprint, leaving the interior untouched. The interior will be capped with concrete.

MONITORING PROCEDURES AND RESULTS
Following the guidelines outlined under the THC’s Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas and Rules
of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas, Versar, Inc. provided one Secretary of the
Interior (SOI) qualified archaeologist to monitor the excavation along the perimeter of the two footprints.
Direct impacts to the APE entailed a stepped, or staged, excavation approach that targeted the perimeter of
each footprint. The Design and Construction Group subcontracted the backhoe and operator. Backhoe
trenching excavated the outline of each footprint and removed sediments within an approximate 2.0 ft wide
(60.96 cm) area (the estimated width of the backhoe bucket) in approximate 12-inch (15.24 cm) vertical
increments. This removal process encircled the outer area of the footprint in a linear process until a
maximum depth of 2.0 ft (60.96 cm) below ground surface was reached. This depth exceeds the 18-inch
(45.72 cm) maximum depth allocated for the concrete footings.
Monitoring consisted of directly observing the excavation process and monitoring the excavation depth.
Versar inspected the spoil piles and soil conditions; spot samples were screened through 1/8-inch hardware
mesh. Exposed soil profiles were examined for cultural deposits. A cross section capturing one trench wall
with profile windows was drawn for each footprint.
MONITORING: FOOTPRINT 1
Backhoe trenching initiated along the west perimeter and moved in a north-to-south direction covering 112
ft. to a depth of 24-inches (34.14 m by 60.96 cm) below ground. The remaining east/west sections followed
by the east perimeter were subsequently completed with similar stratigraphic exposures (Figure 12). The
trench cross section revealed a primary four-strata sequence; Stratum V was identified as fill material and
limited in extent (Figure 13 to Figure 17).

Page 10 of 25

The uppermost stratum was designated Stratum I and consisted of gravel fill used to create the current plaza
parking surface. This overlying deposit was a light grey (5YR7/1; light grey) colored fill that reached a
depth of 1.57-inches (4-cm) below ground surface. Underlying the gravel fill was a chip seal deposit
demarcated as Stratum II. Chip seal surface treatment combines asphalt with gravel aggregate and provided
an anchoring surface for the overlying gravel. Stratum II was black (7.5YR 2.5/1) in color and
approximately 3.14-inches (8-cm) thick.
Stratum III was a pale brown (10YR 6/3) calcium carbonate and coarse sand mixture used as a grading
agent in construction of the plaza parking area. This compact deposit was applied before the application of
the chip seal and allowed for the leveling of ground surface. Stratum III was approximately 3.93-inches
(10-cm) thick and was separated from the underlying Stratum IV by a well-defined unconformity.
Stratum IV was the first encounter of a natural soil deposit within the trench profile and corresponds with
the natural clay deposits identified in Brown et al. (1995: 123). This basal deposit extended below Stratum
III for approximately 14-inches (36-cm) before being arbitrarily terminated at depth. Stratum IV is a
compact, homogenous brown-dark brown (10YR 4/3) clay silt. Few inclusions or gravels were noted; no
artifacts or cultural features were present.
Stratum V is fine sand deposit identified in the far northern portion of Footprint 1. This matrix was present
in the far northern profiles of Footprint 1and tapered off approximately 15 ft. (4.57 m) south of the northern
boundary of Footprint 1. Stratum V is overlain by Strata I, II, and III which were consistent in depthterminating at 8.66-inches (22 cm) below ground surface; the boundary facies between Stratum III and V
was clear and discernable indicating an abrupt removal of the natural occurring Stratum IV (Figure 18).

Stratum V lay beneath Stratum III in this portion of the profile. The matrix was a compact, but clean, fine
textured, homogenous yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand. This deposit extended beyond the 24-inch (9.44
cm) termination level. Moving south along the trench cut, Stratum V rose gradually to abruptly intersect

Page 15 of 25

with the overlying Stratum III. The silt clay Stratum IV was exposed in this section of the profile. The
sloping, well-defined boundary between Stratum IV and V is identified as a mechanical cut and Stratum V
as leveling fill, likely associated with construction of the Mission Hall (Figure 19). To this end, Stratum V
is intrusive into the naturally occurring Stratum IV.

IV and Stratum V; Strata I-III exposed in the upper portion of the cross section.

MONITORING: FOOTPRINT 2
Backhoe trenching of Footprint 2 initiated along the south perimeter and moved in a west-to-east direction
covering 132 ft. to a depth of 24-inches below ground (Figure 20). The remaining north/south end-sections
followed by the north perimeter were subsequently completed with similar stratigraphic exposures. In a
similar fashion to Footprint 1, the trench cross section revealed a four-strata sequence (Figure 22 to Figure
21). The uppermost deposit was designated Stratum I and consisted of gravel fill used to create the current
plaza parking surface. Stratum I was a light grey (5YR7/1; light grey) colored fill that reached a depth of
1.57-inches (4-cm) below ground surface. Underlying the gravel fill was a chip seal deposit demarcated as
Stratum II. Stratum II was a black (7.5YR 2.5/1) colored aggregate approximately 3.14-inches (8-cm) thick.
Stratum III was a mixture of pale brown (10YR 6/3) calcium carbonate and coarse sand. This compact
deposit was applied before the application of the chip seal and allowed for the leveling of ground surface.
Stratum III was approximately 3.93-inches (10-cm) thick and was separated from the underlying Stratum
IV by a well-defined unconformity.
Stratum IV was the first encounter of a natural soil deposit within the trench profile and corresponds with
the natural clay deposits identified in Brown et al. (1995: 123). This basal deposit extended below Stratum
III for approximately 14.17-inches (36-cm) before being arbitrarily terminated at depth. Stratum IV is a
compact, homogenous brown-dark brown (10YR 4/3) clay silt (see Figure 24). Few inclusions or gravels
were noted; no artifacts or cultural features were present.

SUMMARY
Versar, Inc. was contacted by Design and Construction Group, on behalf of the Catholic Diocese of El Paso,
Texas, to conduct archaeological monitoring of mechanical trenching along the perimeter of two proposed
covered booth structures in the parking area/plaza of the Nuestra Señora de La Purísima Concepción del
Socorro Mission (41EP38). The proposed construction effort will provide a covered walkway and
permanent infrastructure for church and community festivals in an open plaza/parking adjacent to the
mission. Two rectangular covered booth structures will be erected in the plaza/parking area south of the

Page 20 of 25

Parish Hall; the north/south structure (Footprint 1) measures 112 ft. by 14 ft. (4.14 m by 4.27 m) in size.
The second area (Footprint 2) is 38.5 ft. (11.73 m) south of the first footprint and was oriented in an
east/west direction; this footprint measured 132 ft. by 14 ft. (40.23 m by 4.27 m) in size.
Mechanical excavation started with Footprint 1; excavations were conducted in layers-the first 12-inches
(30.48 cm) were cautiously removed followed by the remaining 12-inches (30.48 cm) to reach a consistent
depth of 24-inches (60.96 cm) below ground surface. Spot screening of back dirt piles using 1/8-inch
hardware mesh was conducted. No cultural features, artifacts, or utility infrastructure were encountered.
As such, the monitoring process did not identify any new elements to 41EP38. Following the scope-ofwork presented in the work plan, Versar, Inc. documented the excavation process and the stratigraphic
sequence exposed in the backhoe trenching. As the assigned level of effort has been accomplished, no
further fieldwork is recommended. As no cultural deposits were encountered, archaeological clearance is
recommended for the construction of the two covered booths. If any cultural materials are exposed during
any phase of construction, work at the location should cease and the Texas Historical Commission should
be notified immediately. All documents relating to the monitoring efforts will be housed at the Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory, Austin, Texas.
