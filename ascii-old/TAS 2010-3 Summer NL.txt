Come to Corpus Christi October 22-24 for the annual meeting
of TAS. Corpus Christi boasts 288 sun-filled days and was voted
Top Coastal Attraction for the last seven years by S.A. ExpressNews. We think you’ll enjoy your stay.
The Omni Bayfront, located at 900 Shoreline Drive, will serve
as the host hotel again. They offer special rates beginning Thursday evening October 21. TAS needs to fill 80% of the reserved
space so please identify yourself to be included in the block and

will open at noon. The THC Stewardship Network will hold their
fall meeting in the early afternoon and a TAS Board meeting will
follow. See tentative schedule below.
At 3:30 on Friday afternoon the first session on archeology
will be in a new format—a round table with scholars from the U.S.
and Mexico as well as Native American commentators addressing
“Archeology without Borders: Current Research in Texas and NE
Mexico.”

Omni Bayfront Tower

The Public Forum at 7:00 PM on Friday, October 22
“Native Peoples of the Texas and NE Mexican Coast: Prehistory to Today.” will feature talks by Bob Ricklis, Rich
Weinstein and Jose Davila. Each will relate a specific segment of history about the people of the region: Weinstein, “Eight
Thousand Years of Indian Occupation along the Central Texas Coast,” Ricklis, “The Native American Peoples of the
Texas Coast during the Colonial Era: Their Strategies for Cultural Survival in a Rapidly Changing World” and Davila,
“The Apache in NE Mexico and Texas: Continuity and Change in the 21st Century”
A Career Social and Artifact Identification will follow the forum. Archeological firms and agencies will set up displays to encourage questions about archeological work in Texas and about careers in archeology. The TAS members are
invited to bring artifacts for discussion with a panel prepared to type and date finds.

Saturday begins early in the morning with three concurrent sessions
offering papers, posters and round table discussions. Round-tables will be
“Archeology, Ethnology and Tribal Oral History: Links in NE Mexico and
Texas.” And “A Dialogue of Hearts and Minds: Land and Artifact: Indigenous Authenticity/Archaeological Conduct.”
We encourage poster sessions to allow detailed discussion of special
topics. Poster/Presenters will be scheduled for discussion times at their
posters. The Exhibits Room and Silent Auction opens at 8 AM and closes
at 4 PM with pick up of items at 4:30 PM.
At noon Box Lunches will be served at the TAS Annual Meeting
where the approval of the budget and election of officers will be held. Your
choices for lunch sandwiches are smoked turkey, black forest ham or grilled
veggies. The afternoon will be filled with papers, posters and roundtables.
Evening events begin with a Social Hour at 6 PM and the Banquet at 7
PM. Tables will be decorated for a Caribbean theme. Everyone is encouraged to wear costumes for the setting. Your plated dinner will be Caribbean
chicken or a veggie entrée. Speakers for the banquet will be Toni Carrell

A special tour of the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History will be offered at 10:30AM on Friday. Meet at the museum—1900
N. Chaparral. Director Rick Stryker will lead the tour, providing fascinating insight into the natural and historical displays. The Museum is
the state repository for marine archeology and holds the collection of
La Belle artifacts. The exhibit about La Salle is packed with information
and artifacts not seen elsewhere. The 1544 shipwreck that inspired the
Texas Antiquities Code is also on display. This Spanish treasure fleet ran
aground on south Padre Island during a storm. The shipwreck was discovered during the work on the Mansfield channel and was the subject of
a controversy between the state of Texas and the salvagers. Please make
a reservation on your registration form so that we know how to prepare.
Visit the Museum web site to learn more. www.ccmuseum.com. Also find
the museum on Facebook.
The SILENT AUCTION will open at noon on Friday. Local vendors

Saturday Night Banquet “Underwater
Archaeology by Ships of Discovery”
Biographical—Ships of Discovery, a “full-service”
archaeological research and educational institution headed
by Drs. Toni Carrell and Donald Keith, came to live at
the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History in
1992. Toni and Donald will share anecdotes of their most
rewarding—and disastrous—projects in a fast-moving,
heavily-illustrated presentation that will take the audience
from their excavation of the oldest shipwreck ever found in
the Americas to the jungles of Panama, and from designing innovative methods of bronze cannon conservation to
stabilizing a 1,000 year-old Indian paddle—with sugar!
Thematic—Ships of Discovery is truly an institution
that epitomizes “archaeology without borders.” Borders
are not limited to geography. In archaeology, there are
stringent “borders” between such specialties as archival
research, remote sensing, field archaeology, conservation,
exhibit design and fabrication, artifact analysis, and
even publication. Ships of Discovery has worked in a
dozen Caribbean and Central American countries on
both terrestrial and underwater sites spanning at least
1,250 years. They have conducted field surveys and
excavations in Mexico, the Bahamas, Panama, and

Donald Keith, President of Ships of Discovery, will
speak to us at the Banquet Saturday night and
share his anecdotes and adventures.

Sharing the spotlight with Donald Keith, guest speaker
Toni Carrell will feature revelations about archeology,
history and science.

the Dominican Republic, archival research in Spain,
Great Britain, Portugal, Japan and France, and artifact
conservation in Panama, Grand Cayman, and the Turks
and Caicos Islands. For more information visit www.
shipsofdiscovery.org.
In a somewhat unconventional presentation they will
share with the audience a number of surprising revelations
about archaeology, history, and science in general that are
not the sorts of things you can get out of textbooks or by
watching the History Channel. They will draw from personal experience to explain how we found out:
• Why you learn more from your mistakes than your
successes,
• Why if you didn’t write it down—it didn’t happen,
• How to tell when conventional wisdom is dumb,
• Why conservators are conservative, and
• Why you should never ask, “How hard can it be?”

Kathleen Kirk Gilmore: Authority on
Spanish Colonial Archaeology
By JOE SIMNACHER—Reprinted from The Dallas Morning News, Tuesday, March 23, 2010

Kathleen Kirk Gilmore unlocked the mystery of the
location of the French explorer LaSalle’s fort.
Although she was 58 when she received her doctorate in
anthropology, she became an authority on Spanish Colonial
archaeology. Her accomplishments include unlocking one of
the most elusive mysteries of Texas history—the location of
the French explorer LaSalle’s fort.
Dr. Gilmore, 95, pursued her passion to the very end
of her life. She was working on the title page of her yet-tobe completed book on a Spanish captain while she was in
the emergency room Thursday at Texas Health Presbyterian
Hospital Dallas—just before she died. “To me she was just a
regular mother,” said her daughter Pat Gilmore of Dallas. “She
wanted all of us to find something to do that we would enjoy
as a career-life passion like she had.”
Dr. Gilmore was born in Altus, Okla., and grew up in
Tulsa. She had worked since she was in junior high school,
including while she earned a bachelor’s degree in geology
from the University of Oklahoma. She could not find work as
a geologist—a field then dominated by men—but settled for a
position as a secretary for a Houston geologist. During World
War II, she was able to work as a geologist.
She married Robert Beattie Gilmore, who was transferred
to Dallas and became president of De Golyer and MacNaughton, the prominent petroleum consulting firm. Together, the
couple raised four children. Mr. Gilmore died in 2000.
As her children grew up, Dr. Gilmore worked with amateur
archaeological groups and resumed her college studies. She
received her doctorate in anthropology from Southern Methodist University in 1973 and began the professional phase of her
career. She was an adjunct professor at the University of North
Texas from 1974 to 1990. She also continued her field work
and paper research. Dr. Gilmore solved the LaSalle mystery by
determining that the Spanish had built a fort on top of the French
settlement on the Texas Gulf Coast. “They had to go under the
Spanish artifacts in order to find the French [history],” Ms. Gilmore said. “Mother knew where it was, but she couldn’t prove
it until they excavated with the Texas Historical Commission.”
Dr. Gilmore was known for immersing herself in her
work. “She thought you ought to be working all the time,” her
daughter said. “She worked on Saturday and Sunday, day and
night, whenever she wanted to. As she got older, she had to
squeeze in her time when she could.”

Dr. Gilmore in conversation with Dan Potter
at the 2008 Annual Meeting in Lubbock.
At the time of her death, Dr. Gilmore was researching the
story of a Spanish captain who had lived at the Presidio San
Sabá. She had traveled to Spain to research archived correspondence written in old Spanish that reported on the progress of
the New World settlement. “She never stopped,” her daughter
said. “If she ever got down or blue, we would ask her about her
work and she just brightened up. She just loved it.”
Dr. Gilmore was president of the Society for Historical Archaeology, the Texas Archaeological Society and the Council of
Texas Archaeologists. She served on the Texas Board Review,
which recommends nominations for the National Register of
Historic Places, and on the board of the Texas Historical Foundation. In 1995, she was the first woman to receive the J.C.
Harrington Medal in Historical Archaeology as an outstanding
researcher, teacher and mentor. She was a staunch supporter of
women’s rights. In 2008, she received the Governor’s Award for
Historical Preservation. Dr. Gilmore is also survived by another
daughter, Judy Gilmore Lepthien of Denver; five grandchildren;
and three great-grandchildren.
Memorials may be made to the Texas Historical Commission, the Texas Archeological Society or the Society for
Historical Preservation.
Editor’s note: Dr. Gilmore was an active TAS member for
53 years. She visited many TAS Field Schools, especially those
with Spanish Colonial connections. She served TAS as SecretaryTreasurer in 1972, President in 1983, and was recognized as a TAS
Fellow in 1994.

Texas Historical Commission Honors
Austin Archeologist
HOUSTON, Texas—The Texas Historical Commission
(THC) recently recognized Elton Prewitt of Austin with the
Curtis D. Tunnell Lifetime Achievement Award in Archeology. The honor was presented during a special awards dinner
Friday, April 23 at the THC’s 2010 Annual Historic Preservation Conference in Houston. The award is named in honor of
former Texas State Archeologist and THC Executive Director
Curtis Tunnell. The award recognizes outstanding lifetime accomplishments in archeological research and/or preservation.
“The innovation Elton Prewitt has brought to the field
of archeology demonstrates his remarkable commitment to
saving the real places of Texas,” said THC Executive Director
Mark Wolfe. “His research and field work serves to enrich
the lives of others through the history and prehistory of our
state, playing a vital role in preserving these resources for
future generations.”
Prewitt’s involvement in archeology in Texas began in
1963. During a distinguished professional career, Prewitt has
been employed by the Office of the State Archeologist at the
THC, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
at the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas Department
of Transportation. Prewitt worked with Curtis Tunnell, for
whom this award is named, documenting collections for the
Smithsonian Institution that resulted from site investigations
in the Trans-Pecos Region of Texas.
In 1979, Prewitt and his wife Kerza established a private
archeological consulting firm, Prewitt and Associates, Inc.,
the first independent business of its type in the state. Prewitt

Elton proudly holds his well-deserved award. (l to r) Terry

Annual Meeting.

has also been extensively published with his publications
reflecting research interests including prehistoric cultures of
Texas and adjacent areas, regional cultural chronologies in
Texas and the application of remote sensing techniques to
archeological inquiry.
Since his retirement in 2002, Prewitt and Kerza have
dedicated much of their time, commitment and financial
support to the Shumla School, Inc., a nonprofit archeological
research and education center located east of Del Rio in Val
Verde County. The couple recently pledged funding to create an endowment to support the organization’s rock art and
regional research programs.
For more information about THC awards, visit www.thc.
state.tx.us or contact the agency’s History Programs Division
at 512.463.5853.
EDITOR’S NOTE: Elton Prewitt has been a TAS member for 50 years.
His involvement with TAS is so extensive that everything cannot
be mentioned! Highlights would be Principal Investigator of the
Rowe Valley Field Schools, 1982, 83, 84, TAS President, 1986, and
recognition as TAS Fellow, 1990. He has been involved with organizing and planning numerous TAS Annual Meetings, the last being
Del Rio, 2009. Recent field schools have seen Elton heading up the
investigations at the Janee Site in 2004 and 2007, the Melton Site
in 2002, and assisting with the field investigation on the Stallings
Ranch in 2005 and 2006. Elton can usually be found at the artifact
ID tables at the annual meeting as well as field school. TAS is very
proud of Elton receiving the Curtis D. Tunnell Lifetime Achievement
Award in Archeology. Congratulations Elton!

According to responses to a survey sent by the THC
to groups who organized TAM events
in 2009, other hurdles include funding,

events, event promotion and publicity,
low attendance, overcrowding, and attracting specific-age audiences. Some
organizers even describe the work of

Spring 2010

Gone Fishin’—Experimental Archeology on a Small Scale
Solveig A. Turpin
In the spring of 2010, Larry Riemenschneider was asked
to look at a private collection of fiber and stone artifacts from
more than one unidentified rock shelter on the Pecos River
where the owners had a fishing lease in the 1980s. Among the
myriad fiber artifacts was a small bundle of fish hook cactus
spines bound together with twine. Larry and the collector
agreed that this innocuous little artifact was a fishing lure.
Obviously, testing this hypothesis demanded that a replica
be made and that a fish be caught. However, the weather had
been so erratic that Larry’s primary occupation as a farmer
had been greatly delayed, giving us time to cast about for
other examples and their interpretation.
Roberta McGregor drew our attention to a specimen in
the Witte Museum collection from the Shumla Caves that had
been illustrated in Ancient Texans (Shafer 1986: 123). The
caption suggests that the artifact may have been a scarifier
although the text refers to fish hooks made of cactus thorns.
In the original report, Martin (1933: ) describes a full complement of fishing gear, including these and other hooks (fig. 1),
sinkers, stringers, nets and a fish knife. Ironically, this small
bundle was one of many items included in grave goods of an
adult male who was originally called “The Fisherman.” He
mentions that the Mojave Indians were credited with the use
of similar hooks in the Handbook of North American Indians.
A small bundle of fish hook cactus spines from Centipede
Cave is featured on the web page Texas Beyond Prehistory
where their function is listed as unknown. This artifact is so
like the bundle illustrated by Martin (1933) that it is highly
likely that the spines were raw material for simple fish hooks
or lures. Dr. Bob Bosworth, a retired physician and fly fisherman living in Denver, was able to catch trout with flies he
tied using elk hide, hen hackle, and fish hook cactus spines
(Lowell 2010) but the Riemenschneider experiment shows
that is unnecessary to go to those extremes when this simple
lure was adequate for the task.

Larry Riemenschneider holds the fish that didn’t get away.

Using fish hook cactus spines from the Lower Pecos and
ordinary jute twine, Larry created an exact facsimile of the
artifact from photographs of the private collection (fig. 2).
The Riemenschneider family—Jo, Adolph and Anita—accompanied Larry to Brady Lake, serving as witnesses and
camera crew. Larry reports that at first the lure floated but
once it became saturated, it sank and was immediately hit by
a good-sized crappie (fig. 3). A couple of the hooks were the
worse for wear but there are a number of ways to improve on
the lure (see fig. 2), all of which were probably implemented
by prehistoric fishers at one time or another.
This experiment has demonstrated yet another example
of the efficient use of local plants by the people of the Lower

Report to the Membership
The Reports and Curation Committee is comprised
of six members. New to the committee this year are Rolla
Shaller and Mary Jo Galindo while Logan McNatt and
Corina Munsch continue to serve from past years. There is
one open spot on the committee at this time. The committee
meets periodically to discuss the status of incomplete field
school reports, curation goals of the society and special
needs. This is a report on the Reports and Curation Committee’s activities so far this year and a call for assistance.
Several projects are actively being written including
the Oblate Site (1963), the Eubank Ranch (1976-1977),
and Washington Square (1985). Several other back reports
appear to be stalled at this time but may become more active in the future.
Two field school reports are under contract and will
be completed by the end of next year when they will be
submitted to the Bulletin for publication. They are both part

of Victoria field school at Mission Espiritu Santo in 1997
and 1998. Brad Jones will be working on archeological
sites 41VT121 and 41VT129 while Dr. David Robinson
will be writing 41VT128. This will include preparing all
assemblages for curation at TARL. Kay Hindes continues to work on 41VT10, the first location of the mission
Espiritu Santo. Her report should complete the society’s
obligations for the Victoria field school.
The Committee is negotiating a contract for completion of youth group excavations at the Gault site in 2001
and 2002 (see the 2002 fall newsletter). The WilliamsBuck Site (41MN272) was investigated both years, the
first year under Joan Few as PI and the second under Doug
Boyd. Records, maps and artifacts are in good shape and
at TARL for safekeeping, but we seem to be missing the
photographs. If you know where they are or if you have

happy to talk to you. We hope to have something for
Board approval by field school.
The Committee prepared and the Board approved a
Records Transfer, Retention and Archive Plan. The plan,
published in the 2003 fall newsletter (Vol. 47, no. 4), presents a means for any TAS member to submit documents
or photos to the Society for permanent curation at the
University of Texas. Be sure to read how you can preserve
your valuable memories of Society business.
The Committee has prepared a bibliography of all published data on past field schools and is actively upgrading
the document. Look at the website for a complete listing.
If you notice something missing, please let us know so that
we can update the references.
And if you have a desire to participate as a committee
member, please let us know.

Pecos region. In this instance, they used cactus spines and
twine to create an ancestor of the modern lures that line
the tackle box of all serious fishermen. Although its exact
provenience is unknown, the original lure was collected by
one of those serious fishermen and its function demonstrated
by another in a classic example of the value of experimental
archeology.
