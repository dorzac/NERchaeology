MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Between April 29 and September 10, 2003, from September 28-29, 2004, and between December 8-13,
2005, personnel from Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., of Houston, Texas and its geological
consultant conducted an intensive archeological survey of a proposed 118-acre detention basin tract at the
confluence of Cypress Creek and Little Cypress Creek in northern Harris County, Texas. The investigations
were conducted for Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) of Houston, Texas (TAC Permit
Number 3114; HCFCD Unit K500-01-00-Y001). The current report comprises a second revised draft
report of the investigation and is subject to review by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), Harris County Flood Control District, and other agencies as appropriate.
The objectives of this investigation were to locate and identify cultural materials or resources within the
proposed Cypress Creek/Little Cypress Creek Detention Basin locality and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified resources or materials. During the investigations, the crew
excavated a total of 345 shovel tests and ten backhoe trenches. A total of six prehistoric sites, both newly
recorded and previously recorded, were delineated and described. No further work is recommended for
newly recorded sites 41HR971 or 41HR974 based on very limited artifact yeilds. Isolated find 1 also does
not warrant additional work. Site 41HR366, which now incorporates site 41HR338, is a large, highly
productive, and complex site that clearly has important potential to yield new information. Backhoe
trenching at previously recorded site 41HR339 and newly recorded sites 41HR970 and 41HR972, though
smaller and less productive than site 41HR366, contain intact cultural features and therefore likewise
exhibit research potential. Thus, sites 41HR339, 41HR366, 41HR970 and 41HR972 are all considered
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places and for designation as State Archeological Landmarks.
Additional work would therefore be required to mitigate any adverse impacts that result from the
construction of the proposed detention basin. Alternatively, Harris County Flood Control District has
proposed reducing the size of the planned detention basin in order to completely avoid impacting site
41HR366, as well as sites 41HR339, 41HR970, and 41HR972. We suggest that the establishment of a
minimum 20 m buffer zone around the known site limits should be sufficient to prevent adverse impacts to
the site from detention basin-related construction activities, as well as from natural erosion processes.
Engineers from Harris County Flood Control District have prepared documentation of construction
methods to accompany this revised draft that will demonstrate that the sites will remain intact both during
construction and during the lifetime of the detention basin.

CHAPTER I.
INTRODUCTION
Between April 29 and September 10, 2003, personnel from Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC)
conducted an archeological survey of a proposed 118-acre Cypress Creek/Little Cypress Creek Detention
Basin in northwestern Harris County, Texas (HCFCD Unit K500-01-00-Y001). Fieldwork was not
continuous and the majority of the fieldwork was conducted in May and August-September. Additional
investigations, this time focused on geoarcheological assessments of the streamside deposits, were
conducted on September 28-29, 2004. A Revised Draft was prepared incorporating the results of the initial
geoarcheological assessment and submitted in December, 2004. The current, second Revised Draft was
prepared in order to (1) address reviewer comments regarding the December, 2004 Revised Draft, and (2)
to incorporate the results of additional backhoe trenching requested by THC after further discussions with
that agency. The additional backhoe trenching, reported in Appendix 3, was carried out on December 8-13,
2005. Certain text revisions to the current draft that specifically address THC comments on the December,
2004 draft or that incorporate revisions based on the second series of backhoe trenches have been
italicized for clarity and emphasis. The proposed basin is to be located at the intersection of Cypress and
Little Cypress Creeks (Figure 1). The investigations were conducted for Harris County Flood Control
District (HCFCD) of Houston, Texas, and are subject to review by the Archeology Division, Texas
Historical Commission (THC Permit Number 3114) and Harris County Flood Control District.
The objectives of this investigation were to locate and identify cultural materials or resources within the
proposed Cypress Creek/Little Cypress Creek Detention Basin locality and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified resources or materials. Copies of the final report describing the
results of the survey will be submitted to Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD), the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), and other interested parties. The project survey area totals approximately
118 acres (Figure 1). It lies in northwestern Harris County just east and north of the juncture Cypress Creek
and Little Cypress Creek and is situated within the Satsuma, Texas USGS Quadrangle map coverage.
A total of three previously recorded sites were relocated and investigated. The location of a fourth
previously recorded site was also investigated. However nothing could be found at that location. Two of the
previously recorded sites, 41HR338 and 41HR366, were combined into 41HR366 after shovel testing
indicated no basis for separation. A total of four new sites were found and documented. Thus a final total of
six sites, either previously recorded or newly recorded, were visited and delineated during the course of the
present survey. The results of investigations at these sites are presented below in Chapter V. The
environment settings are presented in Chapter II and background sections covering previous archeological
work in the area and the archeology and history of the project area are presented in Chapter III. The
methods employed during the project are discussed in Chapter IV. The artifacts are described and
illustrated in Appendix 1, geomorhphological evaluations based on backhoe trenching are provided in
Appendices 2 and 3, and the shovel test inventory is presented in Appendix 4.
The crew excavated 345 (30 x 40 centimeter) shovel tests at intervals determined by the project
archeologist and as described in the methods section of this report. This shovel test to survey area ratio
greatly exceeds that mandated for both site discovery and delineation by the THC Archeological Survey
Standards. Project archeologist/field director Joe Sanchez and field technicians Randy Ferguson, Nancy
Porter, Darren Schubert, and Josh Gibbs conducted the field investigation under the supervision of the
Principal Investigator, H. Blaine Ensor. In the laboratory, Kelley Lackey and Kelly Schexnayder processed
the artifacts and Kelley Lackey, Douglas Mangum, and Roger Moore produced the reports graphics. Kelley
Lackey prepared the artifact photographs. Josh Gibbs entered the shovel test data into electronic format.
Nancy Porter contributed the section on previous archeological investigations along Cypress Creek. The
2004 and 2005 geoarchaeological studies were conducted by professional geologist and alluvial
geomorphology specialist Dr. Greg Carson, accompanied by project archeologists. The initial study,
Appendix 2, consisted of six backhoe trenches placed adjacent to the creek channel at identified sites. (Two
other backhoe trenches within the nearby HCFCD Unit K500-01-00-R001 project [a separate, but
proximal cultural resource survey carried out under Antiquities Permit No. 3514] are also described in
Appendix 2.) Dr. Carson presents the results of excavation of four additional backhoe trenches at Sites
41HR339, 41HR972, 41HR970, and 41HR366 in Appendix 3. Revisions to the current draft were prepared

CHAPTER II.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS
Modern Climate
The modern climate of the study area can be characterized as hot and wet for most of the year. The mean
annual temperature for the study area region is about 20 degrees Centigrade, with mean rainfalls of 117
centimeters. Summer temperatures average about 34 degrees Centigrade with temperatures above 100
degrees common, during the months of July and August (Carr 1967; St. Clair et al. 1975). The average
winter temperature is a mild 18 degrees Centigrade. Freezes are infrequent and of short duration, with an
average of 271 frost-free days per year. Snow, sleet, and freezing rain are quite uncommon.
Rainfall varies from 7 centimeters in March to 11 centimeters in December, with July to December rainfalls
often associated with tropical fronts and storms. The rainfall records are 45 centimeters in 1917 and 185
centimeters in 1917. Prevailing winds are usually from the southeast except during the winter months
when ‘Northers’ sweep into the area.
Modern Flora and Fauna
Southeast Texas is within the Austroriparian biotic province as defined by Blair (1950:98-101), near its
western boundary with the Texan province. This boundary is marked by the western edge of the pinehardwood forests of the eastern Gulf coastal plain with this boundary set by available moisture levels. The
southeast Texas study area is situated within the pine-oak forest subdivision of the Austroriparian province
and includes, within its western limits, portions of the coastal prairie (Tharp 1939).
Grasses within the coastal prairies and marshes biotic zone are described from a range-management
perspective in Hoffman et al. (nd: 45). This 10,000,000-acre area is comprised of 9,500,000 acres of Gulf
Prairies and 500,000 acres of Gulf Marshes situated along the Texas coast. The regional vegetation of the
coastal prairies is characterized as follows:
The principal grasses of the prairies are tall bunchgrass, including big bluestem
(Andropon gerardi), little bluestem, seacoast bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium,
var. littorus), Indiangrass, eastern gamagrass (Tripascum dactyloides),
switchgrass, and gulf cordgrass. Seashore saltgrass is common on moist saline
sites. Grazing pressures have changed the composition of the range vegetation so
that the grasses now existing are broomsedge bluestem, smutgrass, threeawns,
tumblegrass and many other inferior grasses. The other plants that have invaded
the productive grasslands are oak underbrush, mcartney rose, huisache, mesquite,
pricklypear, ragweed, bitter sneezeweed, broomweed, and many other unpalatable
annual weeds.
The dominant floral species of the pine-oak forest subdivision of the Austroriparian biotic province include
loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus
stellata) and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such trees as sweetgum (Liquidambar styrciflua), magnoila
(Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra) and other species of oaks,
elms, and ashes, as well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal
glabra). Swamps are common in the region.
Blair (1950) and Gadus (Gadus and Howard 1990:12-15) define the following mammals as common within
the Austroriparian province: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus),
raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus aquaticus,
Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus borealis, Sciurus niger, Sciurus carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps, Reithrodonomys fulvescens, Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris, cotton rat (Sigmodon

3

hispidus,), packrat (Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus.). Bison (Bison bison) may have been present on nearby grasslands at various times
in the past (Gadus and Howard 1990:15).
Common land turtles include eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while snapping
turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter (Chrysemys concinna) and
diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise common water turtles. Common lizards include
Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces laticeps, Cnemidophorus
sexlineatus and Ophiosaurus ventralis. Snakes and amphibians are also present in considerable numbers
and diversity.
The resources provided by river-influenced estuarine and marsh environments were undoubtedly of great
importance to the littoral residents of southeast Texas. These resources are admirably summarized by
Gadus (Gadus and Howard 1990:12-15). Estuarine fish resources cited by Gadus include sand trout
(Cynoscion arenarius), spotted sea trout (Cynoscion nebulosus), Atlantic croaker (Micropogon undulatus),
striped mullet (Mugil cephalus), southern flounder (Paralichthysis lethostigma), shortnose gar (Lepisosteus
platostomus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens), red drum
(Sciaenops ocellata), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and other sunfishes. Common shellfish include
Rangia (Rangia cuneata), Macoma spp., dwarf surf clam (Mulinia lateralis), oyster (Crassostrea
virginica), Vioscalba louisianae, and olive nerite (Neritina [Vitta] reclivata). Arthropods such as shrimp
and crab are also numerous and highly productive.
Area marshes replete with plants such as cordgrasses (Spartina spp.), reeds (Phragmites spp.) giant millet
(Setaria magna) and bullrushes (Scirpus spp.) would have formed a highly attractive and bountiful magnet
for waterfowl (Gadus and Howard 1990).
The vegetation along Cypress and Little Cypress Creeks in the vicinity of the project area consists of a
riparian woodland. Relict meander scars or oxbows are present near the current channel on both sides of
Cypress Creek but especially so on the south side between the present Cypress Creek channel and an
artificial drainage ditch south of a sewer plant. There, numerous wetland area designations have been made
in the vicinity of the oxbows. Plant species common to soils in the project area include loblolly pine,
shortleaf pine, water oak, willow oak, red oak, sycamore, sweetgum, cottonwoods, American beautyberry,
wild grape, berries, yaupon, peppervine, longleaf uniolla, beaked panicum, and switchgrass, little bluestem,
indiangrass, and palmetto.
Soils and Geology
The portion of the Texas Gulf Coast that encompasses the current project area rests on sediments laid down
primarily over the last million to two million years. It rests on the Pleistocene Lissie Formation, a deltaic
plain of alluvial origin that runs parallel to the coastline. The Pleistocene Lissie Formation or plain is
comprised of clay, silt, sand, and on occasion, outcrops of fine gravel occur (Barnes 1982). This deltaic
plain was formed during interglacial high sea level when streams discharged into the Gulf of Mexico. It is
characterized by a level to slightly undulating surface and may be marked with shallow ponded depressions
and pimple mounds (Abbott 2001). Calcium carbonate concretions and iron-manganese rhizoliths are often
present (Abbott 2001). The Lissie occurs as a broad, unbroken flat plain dissected only by filled stream
valleys. The Willis Formation outcrops very close to the project area and it is known for its siliceous
gravels that were used by the prehistoric inhabitants. At the time of the 1977-1978 survey by Freeman and
Hale, a notation was made regarding the presence of a gravel bar below previously recorded site 41HR338
(now 41HR366). However no mention is made of what type of gravel or size so it is unknown if any of the
material would have been useable to the aborigines.
The proposed detention basin location is depicted on sheet 42 of the Soil Survey of Harris County
(Wheeler 1976). Soils within the proposed detention basin belong to the Hatliff, Voss, or Clodine
Association (Wheeler 1976). The 1928 soil survey of Harris County (Geib et al. 1928) classifies project
area soils as Acadia fine sandy loam except for along the creeks and perhaps along an old meander scar
near the Cypress/Little Cypress Creek juncture where the soil is classified as Ochlockonee clay. However

4

areas of Ochlocknee fine sandy loam were also included in this mapping unit.
Clodine loam covers much of the project area on the north side of Cypress Creek and east of Little Cypress
Creek in the modern soil mapping. A small area of land inside of a major bend north of Cypress Creek
consists of Hatliff loam while a narrow band of Voss sand parallels both creeks. Voss soils occur on level
to gently sloping sandbars and floodplains. Areas of occurrence include stream banks and recently waterwashed sand in adjoining channels (Wheeler 1976:23). These soils flood one or more times each year
(Wheeler 1976:57), and are subject to frequent washing and deposition of soil material. The probability of
finding deeply buried sites in Voss soils is considered to be high by Abbott (2001).
Hatliff fine sandy loams and loamy sands occur as nearly level soils on floodplains and generally have
smooth boundaries. The soil is subject to washing and to new soil/sediment deposition. Slopes range
mainly from 0-1 percent with up to 2 percent slope in the vicinity of old stream channels. In places, channel
scars or partly filled, old stream channels dissect the surface. The soil is moderately well drained and is
generally flooded a few times a year. The deeply buried site potential for Hatliff loams and loamy fine
sands is considered by Abbott (2001) to be high.
Clodine loam occurs as a nearly level soil in broad, irregular areas. Slopes range from 0-1 percent but
average .5 percent (Wheeler 1976:14). Low, circular sandy mounds occur in some areas. The soil is poorly
drained and the ground stays saturated for 3-6 months during the winter. The deep site potential for Clodine
loam is considered to be low to moderate according to Abbott (2001).
Hydrology
Cypress Creek and Little Cypress Creek have both been previously channelized (Figure 2). Figure 2
depicts the 1916 channel of these creeks as transferred from a georeferenced 1916 edition of that
quadrangle to the modern Satsuma map. The old and new channels are depicted on Figure 2 with the
modern channel represented by a red line and the old channel with a blue line. The project area is centered
to the north of the juncture of these two streams. Cypress Creek joins Spring Creek to the east before it
empties into the San Jacinto River at Lake Houston. Little Cypress and Cypress Creeks are shown as being
somewhat channelized and straightened even on the 1916 edition of the Satsuma topographic map.
Numerous oxbows and old filled stream channels are visible on Figure 3, a map generated using LIDAR
laser contouring imagery. The LIDAR coverage (acronym for light detection and ranging) was provided
courtesy of HCFCD and was processed using ARCVIEW software (Version 3.3) using the Spatial Analyst
extension. An old channel of either Cypress or Little Cypress Creek appears to have flowed southward
through the western portion of the project area before turning east just north of the present Cypress Creek
channel (see Figure 3). Another old stream channel that crosses the northern portion of the project area near
the northern border is also depicted in Figure 3. Other evidence of fluvial activities on the modern
floodplain is visible in the form of erosional scars and oxbows. Dredging has straightened these meanders
to improve drainage in this urban environment (see Figure 2). The artificial berms created by piling dredge
material along the banks of Little Cypress Creek and Cypress Creek have contributed to water diversion
and ponding, especially in the vicinity of the old oxbows. Figure 4 provides a recent view of Cypress Creek
after a heavy rain that underscores the potential for flooding within the project area. Local informants state
that the survey area is largely inundated on a regular basis. The initial impression from shovel test data was
that soil/sediments over much of the area have been reworked over time by flood episodes (field notes,
Appendix 2, Shovel Test Log [Appendix 4]). Swirls visible in the sandy profiles of many shovel tests were
initially considered evidence of water-borne deposition or reworking of these deposits. Presumed evidence
of the effects of running water was especially apparent for shovel tests and sites located in the southern and
eastern portion of the survey area. See Appendices 2 and 3 for a detailed and intensive geoarcheological
assessment of Cypress Creek and the Project Area.

CHAPTER III
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Southeast Texas Culture History
Various syntheses of the archaeology of Southeast Texas and the upper Texas Coast are currently available
for interpreting the chronology, culture history, and lifeways of prehistoric and historic Native Americans
(cf. Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1985, 1995, 1996, Ensor 1990, 1995, 1998, Shafer 1988; Story 1981, 1985,
1990). For example, Aten (1983:141-142) has divided the archeology of the upper Texas Coast into three
periods: (1) Paleo-Indian (12,000 B.P. to 9,000 B.P.), (2) Archaic (9,000 B.P. to 3,000 B.P.), and (3) Late
Prehistoric-Woodland (3,000 B.P. to A.D. 1700). These broad periods appear to correspond more or less
with periods of major environmental change, i.e., (1) the Late Glacial, (2) post-Pleistocene adaptations with
concomitant economic reorientation and population increase, and (3) cultural adaptation to essentially
modern environmental conditions (Aten 1983:141-142).
Other researchers in Southeast Texas have put forth a number of prehistoric sequences or artifact
chronologies based on the available archeological data. Story (1990) has provided her estimate of an
artifact sequence for this area that parallels to a great extent those put forth by other researchers (cf. Shafer
1988, Ensor 1990, 1998). Projectile point sequences outlined and proposed by Patterson (1985, 1991, 1995,
1996) diverge somewhat from the above chronologies in that a wider range of types from central Texas are
proposed as being an integral part of the Southeast Texas sequence. In addition, Patterson’s beginning and
end dates, as well as period of duration and/or overlap for particular dart point/arrow point forms often
deviate from estimates by the above researchers. This review will follow the sequences proposed by Story
(1990) and Ensor (1990, 1998) for the upper Texas Coast.
The earliest projectile points that are usually associated with the prehistoric occupation of Southeast Texas
include occasional finds of fluted and unfluted Clovis points as well as fluted Folsom points. Recently, the
estimated time range for Clovis occupation in Texas has been pushed back based on data from the Aubrey
site near Denton (Ferring 2001) and the Wilson-Leonard site in central Texas (Collins 1998). When these
dates are coupled with recent ice core data from Greenland (Feidel 1999:95-115), it is now estimated that
Clovis-Folsom occupations may date 2,000 years earlier than previously thought across North America. A
time range from 13,500 to 14,500 years before present is now estimated for initial Clovis occupation of
North America by many Paleo-Indian researchers. Traditionally, Clovis and Folsom points are thought to
be followed in time by such unfluted lanceolates as Plainview, Golondrina, and Angostura as well as
notched and unnotched Dalton and San Patrice points in Southeast Texas. However, recent work at the
Wilson-Leonard site near Austin in central Texas has produced evidence that a corner-notched form termed
Wilson follows the Clovis/Folsom occupations. An undefined component intervenes between the Wilson
and Clovis occupations at Wilson-Leonard from 11,400-11,000 B.P. that most closely resembles Plainview
or Folsom (Collins1998). The Wilson period occupation (10,000-9500 B.P.) is in turn followed by such
lanceolates as St. Mary’s Hall and Golondrina/Barber/Angostura which date from 9500 B.P. to 8800 B.P.
(Collins 1998:281). Plainview points are rare at Wilson-Leonard and may predate the St. Mary Hall’s
occupation as noted above.
Further to the east, San Patrice points (coeval with Dalton in the Eastern Woodlands) Ensor (1986) are
thought to be related to Webb et al.’s (1971) types A and B which have also been termed Keithville,
varieties A and B (Story 1990, Webb 1981). These notched forms appear to follow San Patrice in time from
at least 7500 B.C. up to about 6,000 B.C. The relationship of Wilson points to corner notched and sidenotched forms further east such as those reported at the Crawford site in Polk County (Ensor and Carlson
1988), at 41FB19 (Patterson et al. 1987) and elsewhere (Story 1990; Patterson 1996) is unknown. However
these early corner/side notched forms, along with San Patrice points, most likely represent a widespread
regional notched haft technology that is primarily associated with early Holocene climatic events (cf.
Goodyear 1982).
These types in general are followed during the Middle Archaic period by such expanded haft cluster types
as Trinity, Yarbrough, and Carrollton. These point types are believed to date from circa 6,000 B.C. to 2,000

8

B.C. (Story 1990, Ensor 1990, 1998) but they are not well dated. These expanded haft cluster forms along
with straight to slightly contracting stemmed Central Texas types Bulverde and Wells/Morrill points (Ensor
1998; Ensor and Carlson 1988, Patterson 1996) are also thought to fill a long temporal gap in the Southeast
Texas Archaic sequence from about 6,000 B.C. to 2,000 B.C. Other Central Texas types such as Williams,
Lange, Pedernales, and Travis also occur (cf. Ensor, 1990, 1998; Howard et al. 1991; Patterson 1995,
1996). About 2,000 B.C., the late Middle Archaic to early Late Archaic Palmillas type is introduced
followed by Kent and Gary points during the Late Archaic/Early Ceramic periods (Ensor 1990, 1998; Story
1990). Recent excavations at the Eagle’s Ridge shell midden, when coupled with data from Aten et al.’s
(1976) Harris County Boy’s School excavations, indicate that Kent points are confined almost exclusively
to the Late Archaic period from 2800 B.P. to the beginning of the Early Ceramic (Clear Lake) period along
the upper Texas Coast around 2400 to 2200 years ago (Ensor 1998). Kent points occur as a distinct regional
lithic tradition that utilized primarily quartzite and silicified wood gravel for biface manufacture at Eagle’s
Ridge. This marks a distinct technological shift with earlier groups at the site who used principally high
quality cherts for biface manufacture from Paleo-Indian through Middle Archaic times. A similar pattern
has been observed throughout Eastern Texas with the use of non-local exotic cherts prevalent during the
Middle Archaic (cf. Ensor and Carlson 1988; Gadus et al. 1992; Pertulla and Bruseth 1994; Fields 1995).
While no one culture adhered strictly to the use of a single raw material, there was apparently a shift from
long distance regional chert procurement at the end of the Middle Archaic period to localized procurement
during the Late Archaic and Early Ceramic periods at Eagle’s Ridge and by inference much of the upper
Texas Coast (Ensor 1998). Further to the north and east at the Alabonson Road site (Mueller-Wille et al.
1991), the percentage of silicified wood and quartzites versus chert used to make Kent points was the
highest of all projectiles (about a third) even though chert was still the predominate material used in biface
manufacture. This trend for an increase in chert use from east to west in Harris County has been noted by
several researchers (cf. Ensor 2003; Moore 1995; Patterson 1996) and appears to be a direct function of
availability and ease of procurement.
Gary points appear to have been introduced at Eagle’s Ridge and other upper Texas coastal margin sites
around the end of the Late Archaic period or 2400/2200 B.P. While Kent and Gary points share a close
technological history (cf. Weber 1991, Ensor 1991, Patterson 1996), and may in fact be associated with
initial formation of the Mossy Grove tradition (Moore 1995), data from these Texas coastal margin sites
demonstrate clearly that stratigraphic/chronometric separation is possible at some sites (also see Story
1990:222 for a similar opinion). Further, the data from Eagle’s Ridge clearly indicates that Kent points
have a rather restricted temporal duration at this site since expanded haft cluster forms predominate at the
virtual exclusion of Kent points in the lower portion of the midden. While some local variation may exist in
the temporal distribution of these types in Southeast Texas, especially between inland and coastal sites, the
preponderance of evidence to date suggests the above general sequence probably occurred over much of the
area (cf. Story 1990). The question of Gary point or dart point extension into the Late Prehistoric and cooccurrence with arrow points is unresolved.
Story (1990) has noted a very generalized sequence for inland post-Archaic or Late Prehistoric sites. She
refers to this as the Mossy Grove Tradition which later formed the core of Moore’s (1995) dissertation.
Story breaks with Aten (1983, 1984) and Shafer (1975) who referred to post-Archaic remains in Texas as
Woodland. It has been pointed out by Ensor and Carlson (1988) that the Goose Creek pottery tradition most
closely resembles Gulf Formational sandy paste and sand tempered ceramics of Louisiana and the greater
Southeast in terms of decorative modes and paste composition (cf. Walthall and Jenkins 1976). In fact, a
developmental sequence from the Gulf Formational types Tchefuncte and Mandeville (Jenkins and
Walthall 1976; Weinstein and Rivet 1978) to Goose Creek Plain var. Anahuac and Goose Creek Plain var.
Unspecified has recently been postulated by Ensor (1995, 1996, 1998) based on work at the Eagle’s Ridge
shell midden on the upper Texas Coast.
Archeological research at inland Mossy Grove sites has led to a two-fold division into an Early Ceramic
period and a Late Ceramic Period (Ensor 1987, Ensor and Carlson 1991; Fields et al. 1983; Howard et al.
1991; Story 1990; Winchell and Wootan-Ellis 1991). The Early Ceramic period lasts from about A.D. 100
to A.D. 800 and is characterized by sandy paste Goose Creek Plain pottery and Gary points while the
succeeding Late Ceramic period, which lasts from about A.D. 800 to A.D. 1750, is characterized by both

9

sandy paste Goose Creek ware and grog tempered Baytown ware, as well as a variety of arrow point forms
such as Scallorn, Alba, and Perdiz/Cliffton. Other aspects of post-Archaic period lithic assemblage are less
well understood, however there appears to be an overall decrease in flake size from the Early Ceramic
period to the Late Ceramic period (Ensor 1987; Ensor and Carlson 1988; Patterson 1985, 1995, 1996).
Archeological site distribution across the inland coastal prairie of Southeast Texas indicates that sandy,
well drained-elevated soils along creeks and bayous were the favored locales that were repeatedly occupied
(Ensor et al. 1983; Ensor 1987; Fields et al. 1986; Freeman and Hale 1978; Moore 1995, 1996; Patterson
1985). The floodplain and upland margins or scarps where older geologic deposits abut the floodplain are
notably preferred site locations (cf. Ensor et al. 1983; Fields et al. 1986; Hall 1981; Moore 1995). The
occurrence of sites far removed from a dependable water source on the upland prairie is rare (Ensor et al.
1983; Fields et al. 1986; Moore 1995, 1996). However, sites in the Greens Bayou drainage of eastern Harris
County have shown a tendency to be located at greater distances from large streams than further west in
Harris County (Ensor et al. 1990; Sanchez 2003). There are indications that a relatively stable environment
has been in place across Southeast Texas for the past 4,000 years as noted above. The redundancy in
settlement patterning noted by researchers along inland drainages is likely tied to intensive exploitation of
the narrow band of riparian woodland that borders each stream (Ensor 1987). The result may have been the
ubiquitous site clusters, either on sandy pimple mounds or other landforms that occur along the waterways.
Data from the Alabonson Road site, as well as other inland sites, suggest that minimally a dichotomous
breakdown of sites into longer term residential base camps and shorter term extractive sites is evident
(McReynolds, Ensor, and Korgel 1988; Ensor and Carlson 1991; Moore 1995). Moore (1995) further
indicates that evidence of hunter-gatherer logistical activities (Binford 1980) within the riparian zone may
indicate a more complicated pattern of resource extraction and scheduling of day to day activities than
would be expected in a pure forager model and that a three-tier system of residential base camps,
residential bases, and locations or temporary extractive locales may best fit the observed data (Moore
1995:189-190). Establishing criteria that enable the archeologist to empirically separate and/or test the
validity of these hypothetical site types should be a major goal of on-going research. Cemetery sites are
known for inland Southeast Texas with large Late Archaic cemeteries documented at Allens Creek on the
lower Brazos River (Hall 1981). Data from Late Archaic cemeteries at Allens Creek suggest that
widespread movement of exotic goods occurred during this period. Other burials occur in Addicks
Reservoir at the Kobs and Doering sites (Wheat 1953) and isolated individuals have been found at more
intensively occupied sites such as Alabonson Road (Ensor and Carlson 1991).
While there is evidence of long term stability in environmental conditions since the onset of the Late
Holocene; there also exists paleo-environmental and archeological data that suggest short term
environmental fluctuations. For example, the occurrence of bison kill sites across Southeast Texas
(McReynolds, Korgel, and Ensor 1988), often in association with Perdiz arrow points, the presence of
prairie soils in now heavily wooded areas (Ensor et al. 1990), and pollen data indicating climatic
fluctuation (Beck et al. 2001), all suggest such change. Both Patterson (1985) and Ensor (1987) have
posited that populations became more mobile during the Late Ceramic period at inland sites, possibly
related to a drier climate and the expansion of prairies and prairie species.
Regarding the coastal situation, Aten (1983) has subdivided the coastal Mossy Grove sites (Late
Prehistoric/Woodland period) into five prehistoric and three protohistoric sub-periods that span
approximately 2,000 years along the upper Texas coast. The earliest of these he terms the Clear Lake
period from A.D. 100 to A.D. 425 based on radiocarbon dating of early pottery assemblages. Tchefuncte,
Goose Creek, and O’Neal ceramics predominate along with a minority of incised sherds. Gary dart points
are often associated with Clear Lake period middens as are socketed bone projectile points (Story 1990).
Recent data from the Eagle’s Ridge shell midden (Ensor 1998) suggests that Aten’s (1983) subdivision the
Clear Lake period into an early and late period based on varying amounts Goose Creek var. Anahuac and
Mandeville pottery is correct. However some need for refinement is in order based on data from Eagle’s
Ridge. At this site, Mandeville Plain/Stamped and Tchefuncte Plain/Incised/Stamped pottery dominate the
early portion of the Clear Lake period from 2,400/2,200 B.P. to 2,000 B.P. or slightly later. Goose Creek
Plain var. Anahuac dominates the latter portion of this period from 2,000 B.P. to 1,600 B.P. or slightly later

10

(Ensor 1998). Goose Creek Plain var. Unspecified predominates in post-Clear Lake contexts at Eagle’s
Ridge with a very small percentage of decorated ware along with a few arrow points.
Aten (1983) has noted that in the subsequent Mayes Island period from A.D. 425 to A.D. 650 that the
ceramic assemblage consists almost entirely of Goose Creek Plain var. Unspecified with minor amounts of
Goose Creek Incised. It has been surmised that stone dart points may have disappeared but that socketed
bone points continue into this period (Story 1990). The next period, Turtle Bay, runs from A. D. 650 to
A.D. 900. It is characterized by an increase in Goose Creek Red-Filmed and an elaboration of incised
design motifs on Goose Creek Incised pottery (Aten 1983; Ensor 1995). It has been postulated that the bow
and arrow first came into use during this period along the upper Texas coast and that socketed bone points
fell into disuse.
Baytown-related grog-tempered ceramics (Phillips 1970) first appear around A.D. 1000 and mark the
beginning of the Round Lake period (Aten 1983). Sandy paste Goose Creek ceramics decline during this
period. The Phoenix Lake variety of Goose Creek, which is characterized by a dense grog paste, is thought
to predominate by the end of this period at about A.D. 1350. Perdiz/Cliffton arrow points are common and
microlithic drills or perforators become more visible in the archeological record. The final prehistoric
period has been termed the Old River period by Aten (1983). It lasts from about A.D. 1350 until A.D. 1700
and is characterized by an increase in Goose Creek sandy paste pottery and the decline of Baytown grog
tempered ceramics (Aten 1983). Bone tempered pottery is introduced and Perdiz arrow point become more
pervasive during this period (Aten 1983; Ensor 1995; Story 1990). The Old River (prehistoric) period is
followed by the Old River (protohistoric) period, the Early Historic Orcoquisac period and the Late
Historic period (Aten 1983).
The subject of Mossy Grove coastal settlement patterning has been discussed by several researchers (cf.
Aten 1983; Ensor 1987, 1998; Gadus and Howard 1990; Moore 1995; Patterson 1995, 1996; Story 1985,
1990). Most would agree that beginning with the Late Archaic period or certainly by 2000 years ago that
two distinct settlement systems were in place; a coastal and an inland pattern (Aten 1983; Ensor 1998;
Ensor and Carlson 1991; Patterson 1995, 1996; Moore 1995; Story 1990). The establishment of modern
environmental conditions by 4,000 years ago over Southeast Texas seems to coincide with the
establishment of an inland/coastal settlement dichotomy. Articulating different site types between coastal
and inland settings and defining there range and variation has been somewhat problematic. Gadus and
Howard (1990), based on work at Peggy Lake, suggest that longer term residential camps and shorter term
extractive camps (littoral harvesting stations) were present on the coast. This mirrors somewhat the longer
term Type I sites and shorter term Type 2 sites defined for inland site types (McReynolds, Ensor, and
Carlson 1988). Story (1990) describes a minimum of three site types in coastal settings (1) bay margin or
barrier island camps, (2) shorter term sites used in transit between major sites (hunting/foraging camps),
and (3) inland riverine camps that served as places to exploit fresh water stream, woodland, and upland
prairie species (Story 1990:268).
Patterson (1995, 1996) has postulated that a 15 mile wide strip along the coast was exploited by local
populations and formed the basis of a littoral settlement pattern. Prior to the Late Archaic period, there is
evidence that population densities were lower and that the need for social mechanisms to deter group
movement between inland and coastal areas were diminished (Aten 1983). Evidence from Eagle’s Ridge
suggests that such movement did occur on a regular basis during the Early to Middle Holocene and that
populations densities were lower (Ensor 1998). The question of degree of interaction between coastal and
inland groups, the position of group territories or boundaries, and how specific site types may relate to one
another are unclear. Late Prehistoric cemetery sites are common along the coast (Aten 1983; Patterson
1996). Sites such as Harris County Boys School (Aten et al. 1976) and 41GV66 on Galveston Island
(Ricklis 1993, 1994) contain a variety of grave goods. Cemeteries and scattered burials with grave goods
also occur at more inland locations such as at sites 41FB11, 41FB13, and 41FB255 in Fort Bend County
(Walley 1955; Rogers et al. 2000).

Historic Overview
European settlement did not begin to seriously disrupt aboriginal habitation in the areas in and from the
Upper Texas Coast until after AD 1700 (Aten 1983; Patterson 1995:249). European diseases, probably
introduced by explorers and early traders, did begin to have impacts as early as AD 1528. At least 7
epidemics were recorded among the tribes of the study area between that date and AD 1890 (Ewers 1974).
The project area appears to have been on the boundary of the territories of several Native American groups
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Groups that may have resided in Harris County include the
Atakapan, Akokisa, Karankawa, Bidai, and the Tonkawa. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
epidemic diseases, the mission system, and the fur trade acted to severely reduce, and in some cases
exterminate, the indigenous populations.
The upper Texas Coast and Harris County were, in general, sparsely populated in the early 19th century;
neither the French nor the Spanish settled the area to any great extent (Freeman 1990). Some early
settlement occurred along the San Jacinto drainage (Gilbert 1963). However settlement increased at
Harrisburg (Houston) after the land grants were issued to members of Austin’s colony. Despite setbacks
during the Mexican revolution, a land office was set up in Houston, the new county seat, in 1838 (Freeman
1990:13). The Board of Land Commissioners then made land grants which enabled the establishment of
numerous small farms, large ranches, and plantations along local waterways. Lumbering and cotton quickly
took hold after 1880 as the mainstay of Houston economy as many absentee landowners and speculators
held large parcels of timber. Prior to this, stock-raising had been dominant (Carlson 1983). The industrial
base was expanded to support the highly profitable timber industry. Railroads were built to handle
increased cotton and timber shipments during the late 19th century and a large German immigrant
population settled in western and northern Harris County. A deep water port and the Houston Ship channel
were established during the early 20th century and the discovery of oil in the area at about the same time led
to economic good times for the area (Freeman 1990). Cotton continued as an important export through the
1930’s and with the introduction of improved technology, rice cultivation became feasible on previously
uncultivated land (Carlson 1983). The advent of automobile transportation, the development of the service
industries, and increased participation in a global marketplace insured that Houston and Harris County were
gradually transformed into the thriving urban areas we see today.
Previous Archeological Investigations
Prior to beginning field investigations, Moore Archeological Consulting Inc. (MAC) performed a
background investigation of archeological and historical literature relevant to the project area. Literature
examined for this project includes site inventory records on file at TARL, previous archeological
investigative reports on file at the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and MAC and other published
literature pertinent to the current project. A large number of investigations have been conducted within the
Cypress Creek watershed (Dureka 1998; Porter 2003).
In 1977, The Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, conducted a reconnaissance
survey of selected portions of the Cypress Creek watershed in Harris and Waller Counties. This survey
was done at the behest of the Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, who was seeking to assess the
significance of archeological and historical resources within the watershed prior to developing a predictive
drainage basin model. This model would be used to aid in planning future flood control modifications in
the Cypress Creek watershed. Since the sizable basin (320 square miles) could not be entirely surveyed,
the investigations were concentrated on the 100-year flood plain as this would be the most likely portion to
experience modifications.
Approximately 20 percent of the floodplain was surveyed.
Some
reconnaissance was also conducted in selected upland areas contiguous to the floodplain. The
investigations resulted in the recording or reevaluation of 58 prehistoric sites and the recording of 25
historic sites (information on many other historic sites was gathered but stopped short of formal
recordation). The study indicates that there is a relatively high density of prehistoric and historic sites
within the Cypress Creek floodplain and its adjoining uplands. En masse, the prehistoric sites are described
as small in size and believed to reflect general camping activities. More specific site function interpretation
was not attempted due to the limited scope of the reconnaissance. The study area produced artifacts
ranging from the late Paleoindian period to the Late Prehistoric Period. Historic sites included cemeteries,

12

houses, churches, sawmills, roads, road crossings, bridges, schools, railroads, stage stops, and resorts. In
the main, these sites date to the mid-to-late nineteenth century and early twentieth century (Freeman and
Hale 1978).
In 1985, MAC performed a small survey in advance of the construction of a road extension across Cypress
Creek, several kilometers downstream (northeast) of the current project area. No archeological sites were
recorded, and site 41HR525, a prehistoric site recorded by avocational archeologists from the Houston
Archeological Society and lying near the proposed construction corridor, was determined to be destroyed
by clearing and erosion (Moore 1985).
In 1989, the Archeological Research Laboratory of Texas A&M conducted an intensive survey of a
rectangular 645-acre tract, centered on a 13.5 mile segment of Cypress Creek, in northern Harris County.
The tract lies approximately 16 kilometers northeast of the current project area. This investigation was
done in advance of proposed flood control maintenance activities along a segment of Cypress Creek. Four
previously unknown sites (41HR628– 41HR631) were recorded during the survey. Three of these sites
were prehistoric, yielding lithic debris, ceramics, bone, and charcoal. All were deemed potentially eligible
for the NRHP; the fourth, a scatter of modern structure remains, was determined ineligible. Twelve known
sites, all prehistoric, were reassessed. Of those, sites 41HR374 and 41HR375 were determined to have
possible subsurface intact deposits and recommended for eligibility testing (Ensor 1991a).
In 1990, Texas A&M returned to Cypress Creek to conduct National Register eligibility testing at
prehistoric sites 41HR374 and 41HR375. Test units and backhoe trenches were excavated at both sites,
and it was determined that neither site was eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Ensor et al. 1991).
Also in 1990, personnel from Texas A&M conducted an intensive survey of a 43-acre tract in northwestern
Harris County. The tract centered on Faulkey Gully, approximately 1.8 kilometers above the confluence of
the Gully and Cypress Creek and north of the current project area. The investigation was done in advance
of channel dredging within Faulkey Gully. No cultural resources were located (Ensor and Moore 1990).
In 1992, MAC conducted a cultural resources survey of a 90-acre tract, the proposed location of Telge Park
in Harris County on Cypress Creek, approximately seven kilometers upstream (west) of the current study
area. This investigation recorded six prehistoric sites (41HR717-41HR723), all of which were determined
to be eligible for SAL designation. Site 41HR720 was the only site that produced chronologically
diagnostic artifact, an Alba point that may date the site to the Late Prehistoric period. An attempt was
made to relocate previously recorded site 41HR394, the Cypress Creek crossing of the Old Washington
Road. This crossing point was no longer visible; however, a short segment of raised roadbed located in
another portion of the project may be a surviving remnant of the road (Moore 1992).
In 1993, MAC conducted an intensive survey of 143 acres on Little Cypress Creek approximately 1.5
kilometers northwest of its confluence with Cypress Creek. This tract is located approximately 4.5
kilometers west of the current project area. The survey was done in advance of the construction of a
floodwater detention facility along Little Cypress Creek. A single historic cemetery, the Roeder/Becker
Cemetery, was record as 41HR750. An isolated find of a single flake was noted (Moore et al. 1994).
In 1994, Moore Archeological again performed a survey in the Cypress Creek watershed. This 50-acre
investigation took place on the banks of an unnamed tributary of Cypress Creek at the western edge of
Harris County. The survey was done in advance of a creek bank mitigation project. No cultural resources
were located (Moore and Daigle 1996).
In 1996, MAC conducted an intensive survey on a 488-acre tract along the north bank of Cypress Creek in
northern Harris County. Cypress Creek defines the southern border of the tract, and the eastern edge of the
tract sits at the confluence of Cypress and Spring Creeks. This tract lies approximately 20 kilometers
northeast of the current project area. While this seems a great distance, the floodplain area investigated
bears a striking resemblance to the current project area. This investigation was done in advance of the
construction of a golf course. Thirteen previously unknown sites (41HR584-41HR596) were recorded, and
previously recorded site 41HR371 was revisited. The newly recorded sites were characterized as sparse

13

subsurface lithic scatters, small in size and producing no diagnostic artifacts. A reassessment of 41HR371,
a larger site dating to the Early Ceramic Period, found it to be in good condition and worthy of protection.
All sites identified and reassessed during the survey were deemed eligible for nomination as SALs and
recommended for avoidance during construction (Moore 1997).
Also in 1996, personnel from Geo-Marine, Inc. conducted survey, backhoe trenching, and geoarcheological
investigations in two areas of the Cypress Creek floodplain in northern Harris County. These
investigations were carried out at the request of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to the
commencement of channel improvements and drainage basin construction. Prehistoric sites 41HR789 and
790, described as extremely low-density, shallow lithic artifact scatters, were recorded. Neither site was
deemed eligible for SAL or NRHP designation (Ensor et al. 1996).
A survey was conducted by personnel from Moore Archeological Consulting (MAC) in 1996 on a 43-acre
parcel approximately 1.2 kilometers upstream (west) of the juncture of Cypress Creek and Faulkey Gully.
The tract was the location of a proposed floodwater detention basin. The investigation recorded thirteen
previously unknown archeological sites – twelve prehistoric sites and one prehistoric site with a surface
historic component (41HR774 through 41HR786). Sites ranged from sparse lithic scatters on large sandy
rises to sizable, full-function campsites on broad levee ridges. Lithic and ceramic samples from the sites
indicate occupation(s) during the Late Prehistoric and possibly a second occupation or series of occupations
dating to as early as the Middle Archaic. The historic component at 41HR783 appears to be structural
remains (mostly brick fragments) of unknown origin; however, Moore states that the remains resemble
portable sawmill remnants found elsewhere in Harris County. Nine of the sites were recommended for
further investigation if they were to be impacted by detention basin construction (Moore et al.1996).
In early 2003, an additional survey was conducted by personnel from MAC approximately 1.5 kilometers
upstream (west) of the 129-acre tract discussed below. The project consisted of a reconnaissance survey of
a 47-acre tract scheduled for purchase by HCFCD to serve as a floodplain preservation area. Three
prehistoric sites (41HR945-947), situated on sandy rises or ridges were located and recorded as subsurface
lithic scatters. One site, 41HR947, was determined not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) status. The two remaining sites were
recommended for further investigations if subsurface disturbance would be necessary in the future (Porter
and Moore 2003).
More recently, in February and March of 2003, personnel from MAC conducted an archeological survey of
a 129-acre floodplain preservation area in northwestern Harris County along Cypress Creek near its
juncture with Faulkey Gully (Porter 2003). A total of 406 shovel tests were dug in an attempt to locate sites
and define site boundaries. Twenty new sites were found but three previously recorded sites could not be
relocated. Site density was calculated at 1 site for every 6.5 acres surveyed or .16 sites/acre. One site was
deemed ineligible as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) while the eligibility of the other sites could
not be determined due to the reconnaissance nature of the survey (Porter 2003).
On September 2, 14-16, 20, and 27, 2004, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural
resource survey investigation of the proposed K500-01-00-R001 45-acre detention basin along Cypress
Creek in Harris County, Texas. This investigation was located immediately downstream from the K500-0100-Y001 project herein reported. The investigations were conducted for the Harris County Flood Control
District under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 3514 (MAC PN 04-90).
An intensive pedestrian field survey of the K500-01-00-R001 project area was conducted, and included
both surface and subsurface (shovel test and backhoe) examination. A total of 54 shovel tests and two
backhoe trenches were excavated.
These backhoe trenches were observed and evaluated by
geomorphologist Eric Carson and his analysis of the K500-01-00-R001 project is included in Appendix 2
of this report. A single site, 41HR985, was identified in the northeast portion of the project area,
approximately 50 m from Cypress Creek. The site is extremely limited in terms of artifact density,
variability, and site size, and thus appears to offer little potential to yield new information. Consequently,
the site did not meet the criteria for site significance, and did not warrant inclusion in the National
Register.

CHAPTER IV.
METHODS
The 118-acre proposed Cypress-Little Cypress Creeks detention basin locality consisted of a fairly
undisturbed area of riparian forest and wooded floodplain at the juncture of Cypress and Little Cypress
Creeks (see Figure 3; Figure 5). The southern and eastern boundaries are Cypress Creek and a small tract of
land south of this creek, the western boundary is Little Cypress Creek, and the northern boundary is
comprised of property lines and a ditch west of North Eldridge Road (Figure 5). The entire area is heavily
vegetated with grasses, weeds, vines, forbs, and trees. An examination of the 1920 Satsuma topographic
map and 1928 soils map indicates that no structures or roads are present.
The area contains numerous old oxbow cut-offs and wetland areas (see Figures 2-3). Figure 2 shows the
relationship between the present Cypress Creek channel and the channel as depicted on the 1920 USGS 15’
quadrangle. It can be seen that numerous old cut-offs and meander scars are present and some of these
contain elevated landforms with archeological sites. Sites also occur on relatively flat landforms that
possessed very little topographic variation. Figure 3 is a LIDAR image that shows the locations of current
and former watercourses in the project area. Some of these appear to represent old channels/meanders of
Little Cypress Creek and Cypress Creek. The only surface visibility within the project area was along the
eroded creek banks and in the bottom of the creeks. Mechanized creek channelization and artificial berm
construction along with natural disturbance processes such as erosion, flood re-deposition, and
bioturbation, were noted in the project area. The area has been logged and all-terrain vehicle trails had also
disturbed the surface of the project area. Recently, vandals have excavated several large potholes at site
41HR366. In addition, a large drainage ditch had been excavated and a large berm created that parallels the
ditch just east of the sewage plant on the south side of Cypress Creek (Figure 5. The small tract of land
west of Cypress Creek was wooded for the most part and contained an artificial berm and numerous
oxbows and wetland areas. A large drainage canal is located along the western border of the property
(Figure 5).
The survey began with a brief reconnaissance of the project area to examine landforms, exposed cutbanks,
and overall survey conditions. Shovel tests were then dug about every 50 m near Little Cypress and
Cypress Creeks. Highly disturbed and low, wet areas were avoided. Shovel tests were numbered
consecutively throughout the duration of the project. When an elevated or high probability landform was
encountered such as a high area near an oxbow lake, the shovel test interval was reduced to 30 m or less.
Survey methods changed for “inland” areas located a considerable distance from water. First, the
northern/eastern boundary was established by using a compass, GPS points, and flagging tape since the
area had not been staked or otherwise marked prior to the survey. A line was also established in a similar
manner through the center of the inland area from north to south to facilitate the use of transects. In this
manner, short transects were surveyed east of the centerline working in a general northwest to southeast
direction. When this section was complete, the area west of the centerline was surveyed using transects
working from the southeast to the northwest. Transects were spaced about 30 m apart. Shovel tests were
dug at approximate 150 m intervals along the transects and on all elevated landforms such as low ridge
lines. A total of 116 general exploratory tests were dug and an additional 229 shovel tests were dug in
connection with site delineation. Figure 5 depicts the location of all shovel tests. No pimple mounds were
observed although several rises that resembled pimple mounds were tested. Most shovel tests (N=236)
reached subsoil or basal clay. A total of 109 tests did not reach clay and these were located principally
within 100 m of the creeks, within the active floodplain.
The crew excavated all 345 shovel tests in 10-15 cm arbitrary levels and screened the soils through 1/4”
hardware cloth wherever possible. Soils that were too compact or clayey to sieve through hardware cloth
were carefully broken up by hand. All soils were carefully examined for cultural artifacts. Location, size,
depth, and all other information for each shovel test was recorded on standardized MAC shovel test forms
(see Appendix B). Shovel tests were immediately backfilled. The UTM location of all shovel tests was
recorded. The location of each shovel test was then plotted on a USGS quadrangle map of the project area
(see Figure 5). Photographs were taken of vegetation, cut banks, and disturbed areas within the project area
(see Figure 4 and Chapter 5 below). Photograph direction, subject, photographer name, and dates were
recorded on a standard Moore Archeological Consulting photo log.

15

In order to determine the depositional nature of the project area, especially in relation to the identified sites
in proximity to the creek, six backhoe trenches (BHTs 1-6) were initially excavated. BHT 1 was placed at
site 41HR339, BHT 2 at site 41HR972, BHT 3 at site 41HR970, and BHTs 4-6 at site 41HR366 (Figure 5).
Trenches 1-6 ranged from 3.5-5 m in length, and from 1.4 to 3.4 m in depth. At each trench, one wall was
cleaned and its profile drawn, photographs were taken, and the trench was located using a hand-held GPS
unit. The locations of these trenches are depicted on Figure 5 and Figure A2-11, Appendix 2.
The Archeology Division requested additional backhoe testing in the most productive portions of the sites
(as opposed to the area proximal to the creek) as a final stage of the investigation. Four trenches were
excavated under the direction of Dr. Eric Carson and archeologists from Moore Archeological Consulting,
Inc. The locations of these trenches are depicted on Figure A3-4, Appendix 3. For a discussion of the
geoarcheological investigations and profile drawings of each trench, see Appendices 2 and 3.

CHAPTER V.
RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Results
The project area was subjected to an intensive 100 percent pedestrian survey. Survey was conducted using
systematic transects spaced 30 m apart. All exposed ground surfaces and other exposures within the project
area were carefully examined for artifacts. This survey methodology resulted in the excavation of 345
shovel tests. Two hundred twenty-nine of those tests were dug as part of site delineation efforts with site
41HR366 receiving the most testing due to its large size. The cutbank profiles along Cypress and Little
Cypress Creeks were also examined. Maximum shovel test depth was 150 cmbs with most tests excavated
to between 70 cmbs and 120 cmbs. The ratio of shovel tests to acres surveyed is 3 tests for every acre
surveyed which is well above the minimum number of 1 test for every 3 acres for surveys between 100 and
200 acres in size mandated by the THC. Six backhoe trenches were excavated at various site locations in
the project area. They ranged from 1.4 to 3.4 m in depth.
During the course of survey, it was noted that the sandy alluvium was deeper close to the creeks and
shallower with more concretions the further one moved to the east. In fact, most of the tests that did not
reach clay were located within 100 m of the present Little Cypress and Cypress Creek channels. This likely
is due to the dynamic cutting and filling of the Little Cypress-Cypress Creek channels. From north to south
(below the Cypress/Little Cypress juncture) the soils/sediments change from a deep friable sandy loam to a
very firm yet fine sandy loam with increased silt content. The silt appears to be responsible for the increase
in soil hardness. This made shovel test excavation more difficult in these areas. The southern portion of the
survey area is mapped as a wetland and water stands on the surface for extended periods of time. Many of
the tests in this area exhibited swirled bands or lenses in the profiles. These features were interpreted as the
result of repeated scouring and re-deposition of soil/sediments. The swirled soil observations corresponded
with the locations of sites 41HR339, 41HR970, 41HR971, and 41HR972. The initial geoarcheological
assessment (Appendix 2) of the project area appeared to confirm this depositional model, noting that sites
immediately adjacent to the creek are located within a highly dynamic meander belt. Different results were
obtained, however, when additional trenching was conducted in the more productive, further inland
portions of Sites 41HR339, 41HR972, 41HR970, and 41HR366 (Appendix 3). These results yielded
sufficient evidence of in situ soil and archeological deposits to force revision of the initial significance
assessment of these sites.
A total of three previously recorded prehistoric sites were revisited and re-recorded including 41HR338,
41HR339, and 41HR366. Site 41HR338 was combined with 41HR366 based on survey shovel test data. A
fourth previously recorded site, 41HR393, a reported recent log shelter, could not be relocated although a
pile of limbs or branches was found in the general vicinity of the reported location. It is unclear why this
site was recorded in the first place since the recorders describe it as being recent in nature. A total of 4 new
prehistoric sites were found. Sites 41HR970, 41HR971, 41HR972, and 41HR974 were newly recorded in
the project area bringing the total number of sites recorded and described in this report to six. In addition to
the sites, one isolated find was made. A summary of all artifacts recovered during the survey and site
delineation is presented by site and major category in Table 1.

Site Type: Prehistoric lithic-ceramic scatter
Site Description:
This large prehistoric lithic scatter (N=70) had been previously recorded in 1977 by personnel from the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin. At that time, the site was described as
consisting of a lithic and sherd scatter eroding from a small cutbank exposure (Freeman and Hale 1978).
The site had been impacted at that time by Corps of Engineers dredge activity. No shovel testing was
conducted at that time. The site was revisited during May of 2003 by a crew from MAC. The site is located
on the northern bank of Cypress Creek near the southeastern corner of the project area. The precise location
of site 41HR339 has been provided to TARL and the THC under separate cover. Its dimensions are 180 m
by 125 m and artifacts were recovered from 0-120 cm below surface (Figure 6). The site is located on an
elevated ridge or rise about 65 cm above the forest floor. The rise appears to be a terrace remnant. The
southern portion of the site has been disturbed by pipeline construction, cutbank rectification, and fluvial
erosion. The eastern portion of the site has been truncated by pipeline construction.
The site area is heavily vegetated with large oaks, elms, pine, sweetgum, and hackberry and a dense
understory of yaupon, saplings, and vines. Surface visibility was non-existent due to a heavy leaf litter. A
total of 27 shovel tests were excavated during the course of site relocation, site delineation, and site
mapping. Subsoil or basal clay was reached in 18 of the tests (Appendix 4). Of the 27 total shovel tests, 12
were positive and the remaining 15 were negative (Figure 6). The site limits were defined by excavating
two consecutive negative tests in undisturbed areas and by the natural elevated landform. The site is
assumed to extend beneath an existing berm and connect with the artifact-bearing cutbank exposure
identified by Hale and Freeman since the clay berm could not be penetrated (Figure 7). During the 2004
geoarcheological investigations, one backhoe trench (BHT 1; Appendix 2) was excavated proximal to the
creek within the site. A second backhoe trench (BHT 7; Appendix 3) was excavated at an interior, more
productive portion of the site. This trench produced evidence of in situ soils and significant archeological
deposits in the form of an ash and charcoal-flecked pit feature. This feature is presumed to be a hearth. A
permanent datum was established by nailing an aluminum tag inscribed with “MAC 03-56, Site 41HR339”
to a 70 cm diameter pine tree 50 cm above the ground.
Artifact Discussion:
Artifacts found during the original survey of Freeman and Hale (1978) include 3 primary flakes, 1
secondary flake, and 9 tertiary flakes along with 1 chert scraper and 14 pottery sherds. Artifacts recovered
during the present survey include 1 dart point distal tip and a utilized flake. In addition, a total of 5 primary
flakes, 6 secondary flakes, and 18 tertiary flakes were found. A total of 37 flake fragments and 2 pieces of
debris were also recovered. No ceramic artifacts were found.

Recommendations:
Site 41HR339 is represented by a low to moderate density lithic and ceramic scatter contained within a 120
cm thick vertical sandy deposit. The artifacts appear to be restricted to a slightly elevated levee remnant.
Vertical artifact distributions within the shovel tests indicate that there is little evidence of stratified
deposits or component separation (see Appendix 4). Lithic tool diversity is low and no culture-historic
diagnostics were recovered. The site has been disturbed by pipeline construction, cutbank rectification, and
fluvial erosion and/or re-deposition. The eastern portion of the site has been truncated by pipeline
construction. The initial geoarcheological investigations (Appendix 2) indicated that the archeological
deposits are not intact and the cultural materials are not in primary context (Appendix 2). While this
conclusion remains valid for the immediate area of BHT 1, geomorphic analysis of an additional trench
(BHT 7) excavated further inland within the site yielded radically different results (Appendix 3). This
trench suggested strongly that the site deposits not immediately proximal to Cypress Creek are intact and
have the potential to yield new information. Based on the new information from the Appendix 3 trench, Site
41HR339 is considered as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. Further investigation is recommended if the site cannot be successfully avoided and protected
from detention basin impacts as currently planned by the Harris County Flood Control District.

Site Type: Prehistoric ceramic and lithic scatter
Site Description:
This long, linear site is located on the northern bank of Cypress Creek at the confluence of Cypress Creek
and Little Cypress Creek (Figures 8-10). It possesses a moderate to high artifact density. The precise
location of site 41HR366 has been provided to TARL and the THC under separate cover. Its dimensions
are approximately 600 m northwest-southeast by 170 m east to west. Artifacts (N=335) were recovered
from 0-130 cm below surface. The site is located directly east of the confluence of Cypress Creek and Little
Cypress Creek and it extends some 300 m southeast of the confluence. The northwestern boundary of the
site extends outside the project area (Figure 10). The terrain consists of high ground east of the creek banks
with a gradual downward slope to an ephemeral drainage that borders the northeastern site boundary.
Heavy erosion has occurred along the creek banks and adjacent to ephemeral drainages. Much of this is due
to previous channel rectification associated with flood control improvements. Since the site is located on
the active floodplain, soil/sediment erosion and re-deposition have taken place. Some areas apparently
remain relatively intact, however, based on shovel test data. Several meander scars, cut-offs, or oxbows are
present within the site limits (Figures 8, 10) and one linear drainage scar is present at the northern end of
the site that may represent an old stream course. Other disturbance processes include tree fall, logging,
ATV trails, bioturbation, and vandalism.
The site area is heavily vegetated with oak, pine, and hackberry and a dense understory of privet, yaupon,
saplings, and vines. Surface visibility (<5 percent) was virtually non-existent due to heavy vegetative
and/or leaf cover (Figure 8). A total of 130 shovel tests were excavated during the course of site relocation,
site delineation, and site mapping. Subsoil or basal clay was reached in 58 of the tests (Appendix 4). Of the
total of 130 tests, 55 were positive and the remaining 75 were negative (Figure 10). The site was defined by
excavating two consecutive negative tests from the last positive test in undisturbed areas and by the natural
elevated landforms and the creeks. Shovel tests were not placed in heavily disturbed areas, low wet areas,
or within standing water. During the 2004 geoarcheological investigations, three backhoe trenches (BHTs
4-6) were excavated at the site. A fourth trench (BHT 10) was excavated during the 2005 geomorphic
reassessment.
Where the berm exists, the site is assumed to extend beneath it towards Cypress Creek and Little Cypress
Creek where Hale and Freeman had identified eroding cultural deposits (see Figure 10). Previously
recorded site 41HR338 was combined with previously recorded site 41HR366 since no basis could be
found for separating them. Site 41HR338 had been initially defined based on artifacts eroding from two
areas of the cutbank along Little Cypress Creek below a linear rise or slightly elevated knoll or terrace. A
permanent datum was established by nailing an aluminum tag inscribed with “MAC 03-56, 41HR366” to a
70 cm diameter oak tree 50 cm above the ground (see Figure 10). Based on shovel test data, three areas of
high artifact density were noted at this site (see Figure 10). One of these is located at the northern end of
the site, a small “midden-like” area was detected near the confluence of Cypress and Little Cypress Creeks
(Figure 9), and the third area is located in the southern portion of the site.
Artifact Discussion:
Artifact collections had been made at both 41HR338 and 41HR366 during the original Freeman and Hale
survey (1978) at the juncture of Cypress and Little Cypress Creeks. Two separate areas, designated Area A

23

and Area B, produced artifacts during the original survey. Area A produced one Gary-like dart point and 2
sherds with orange surfaces. Area B produced 47 flakes, 44 of chert, and 3 silicified wood flakes. The
flakes were located in a small gravel bar below an outfall pipe along Little Cypress Creek. These data
would indicate a Late Prehistoric (Early-Late Ceramic) period occupation.
Artifacts recovered during the present survey include 1 Yarbrough dart point, 1 unifacial scraper fragment,
2 biface fragments, and 10 use-modified flakes (see Table 1; Appendix 1, Figure 18). In addition, a total of
9 primary flakes, 57 secondary flakes, and 79 tertiary flakes were found. A total of 112 flake fragments and
22 pieces of debris were also recovered. Three pieces of unmodified ochre/sandstone were found. A total of
12 Goose Creek Plain sherds were recovered from shovel testing and an additional 17 sherdlets were also
found during shovel testing (see Table 1). In addition, 8 Goose Creek Plain sherds were also found in the
backdirt from a vandal’s or looters hole at this site (see Appendix 1). Two rim sherds, one with interior
scrape marks, are illustrated in Appendix 1, Figure 19.

26

Recommendations:
Site 41HR366 is represented by a moderate density lithic/ceramic scatter contained within a 130 cm thick
vertical sandy deposit. Three areas of high concentration were noted (see Figure 10), with Areas 1 and 3
producing large amounts of flake debris along with Goose Creek Plain pottery. Lithic tool diversity is low.
Diagnostic artifacts recovered during the present survey include a Yarbrough dart point from a meter below
surface and numerous sherds or sherdlets of Goose Creek Plain pottery. A Gary-like point was also
recovered during the initial Freeman and Hale survey. The vertical distribution of the lithic debris from
shovel tests indicates that materials were recovered from virtually the entire upper 130 cm of site deposits.
However some tests, such as those in the vicinity of the midden-like soil or Area 2 (see Figure 10),
produced high amounts of lithic debris from relatively restricted vertical areas within the site. The middenlike soil appears to be associated with aboriginal burning since some flakes had burned soil/sediment
adhering to one or more flake surfaces. Horizontal and/or vertical stratification of components could be
present within the site area with components ranging in age from the Middle Archaic up to the Late
Ceramic period possible. The geoarcheological investigations indicate that the interior portions of the site
and the area along Little Cypress Creek contain intact archeological deposits. In contrast, the area directly
adjacent to Cypress Creek (within ca. 20 m) appears to be within portions of the creek’s meander belt that
were active subsequent to the occupation of this portion of the site. These deposits and the cultural
materials within them appear to have been disturbed by erosion. As a result, the archeological deposits
observed there do not appear to be intact and the cultural materials are not in primary context.
Site 41HR366 represents the remnant of a large campsite at the confluence of Cypress and Little Cypress
Creeks. It was no doubt strategically located to take advantage of the riparian woodland zone and other
resources available at the Cypress and Little Cypress Creek juncture. The site is considered as potentially
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and designation as a State Archeological Landmark. Further
investigation is recommended if Site 41HR366 cannot be successfully avoided and protected from detention
basin impacts as currently planned by the Harris County Flood Control District. In the event of any future
proposed impact to the site, a geoarcheologist should work in conjunction with an archeological testing
crew to determine the nature, context and integrity of the archeological deposits in the three high density
areas.

Site Description:
Site 41HR970 is a moderate-sized, moderate density, prehistoric ceramic and lithic scatter (N=46) located
on the northern bank of Cypress Creek inside of a prominent bend in the creek (Figures 11-12). The exact
site location has been provided to TARL and the THC under separate cover. Its dimensions are 95 m by 60
m and artifacts were recovered from 30-130 cm below surface (Figure 11). The site is located on a slightly
elevated, but relatively flat area that slopes gently east-northeast. Linear clay berms from creek
channelization are present on the southern portion of the site and the site is assumed to extend underneath
toward Cypress Creek (Figure 11). Site impacts include heavy treefall, various forms of bioturbation,
logging, and repeated flooding/erosion.
The site area is heavily vegetated with large oaks, elms, pine, sweetgum, and hackberry with a dense
understory of yaupon, saplings, and vines (Figure 12). Surface visibility was non-existent due to heavy
vegetation/leaf litter. A permanent datum was established by nailing an aluminum tag inscribed with “MAC
03-56, Temp. site #3” to a 60 cm diameter sweet gum tree 50 cm above the ground (Figure 11).

Figure 12. 412HR970 overview of landform, vegetation and ground cover.
A total of 22 shovel tests were excavated during the course of site relocation, site delineation, and site
mapping. Subsoil or basal clay was reached in 3 of the tests (Appendix 4). Of the total of 22 tests, 9 were
positive and the remaining 13 were negative (Figure 11). One backhoe trench (BHT 3) was excavated at the
site during the 2004 geoarcheological investigations, and a second trench (BHT 9) was excxavated in
2005. General observations made by the crew while excavating shovel tests indicates that the
soil/sediments at the site have been subjected to extensive sheet wash and erosion and resulted in the wide
vertical dispersion of the artifacts. A conclusion that soils, and hence archeological deposits, were not in
situ was supported by the geoarcheologial investigations conducted in 2004 (Appendix 2), but only for the
area adjacent to the creek that was sampled by BHT 3. Additional testing and geomorphic evaluation at a
more productive and inland portion of the site (BHT 9, Appendix 3) suggested that the soils within the
major potion of the site were fundamentally intact. The presence of a possible hearth represented by a pit
feature with ash and charcoal flecking further supported that any archeological deposits were largely
intact. Thus, the observations regarding sheet wash and artifact dispersion made by the field crew during
the initial survey and site delineation were not upheld.

29

Artifact Discussion:
Artifacts recovered during the present survey include 1 dart point preform (stemmed biface), 1 arrow point
preform-? (Perdiz-like), and 2 use-modified flakes (see Table 1). In addition, a total of 4 primary flakes, 6
secondary flakes, and 10 tertiary flakes were found. A total of 17 flake fragments and 2 pieces of debris
were also recovered. Three Goose Creek Plain sherds or sherdlets were recovered (see Table 1).
Recommendations:
Site 41HR970 is represented by a moderate density lithic/ceramic scatter contained within a one meter
thick vertical sandy deposit. Artifacts were vertically fairly equitably dispersed within a 70 cm thick
cultural deposit and below a modern flood deposit. Lithic tool diversity is low and the only potentially
diagnostic artifacts recovered were a possible Perdiz arrow point preform and a small number of Goose
Creek Plain ceramics. Shovel test results were originally believed to indicate that quite a bit of fluvial
reworking of site soils/sediments has occurred. The initial geoarcheological investigations (Appendix 2)
indicated that the archeological deposits are not intact and the cultural materials are not in primary
context (Appendix 2). While this conclusion remains valid for the immediate vicinity of BHT 3, geomorphic
analysis of an additional trench (BHT 9) excavated further inland within the site yielded radically different
results (Appendix 3). This trench suggested strongly that the site deposits not immediately proximal to the
creek are intact and have the potential to yield new information. Based on the new conclusions from the
Appendix 3 trench, the site is considered as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark. Further investigation is recommended if Site 41HR970 cannot be
successfully avoided and protected from detention basin impacts as currently planned by the Harris County
Flood Control District.

Site Type: Prehistoric lithic scatter
Site Description:
This small, low density prehistoric lithic scatter (N=7) is located northwest of Cypress Creek in the southcentral portion of the project area (Figure 13). The exact location of site 41HR971 has been provided to
TARL and the THC under separate cover. Its dimensions are 40 m by 30 m and a small number of artifacts
were recovered from 20 cm to 90 cm below surface (Figure 13). The site is located on a slight rise
(probable terrace remnant) to the north-northwest of an oxbow lake that was created when the original
channel was straightened to improve drainage (Figure 13). The rise drops off precipitously to the southsoutheast and has a gentle slope to the northwest. Impacts to the site include erosion/reworking of site
soils/sediments by fluvial action, logging, bioturbation, and tree fall.
The site area is heavily vegetated with large oaks, elms, pine, sweet gum, and hackberry with a dense
understory of yaupon, saplings, and vines. Surface visibility was non-existent due to heavy vegetation
including leaf litter. A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated during the course of site relocation, site
delineation, and site mapping. Subsoil or basal clay was reached by all of the tests (Appendix 4). Of the
total tests, 3 were positive and the remaining 8 were negative (Figure 13). The site limits were defined by

30

excavating two consecutive negative tests in undisturbed areas, by the natural elevated landform, and by the
oxbow lake. A permanent datum was established by nailing an aluminum tag inscribed “MAC Temp. site #
4” to a 50 cm diameter elm tree 50 cm above the ground (see Figure 13).
Artifact Discussion:
Artifacts recovered during the present survey include 1 primary flake, 1 secondary flake, 3 tertiary flakes,
and 2 flake fragments. No ceramics were recovered and no culture historic markers were recovered.

Recommendations:
Site 41HR971 is represented by a low density lithic scatter contained within a 70 cm thick vertical sandy
deposit. Lithic tool diversity is low and no diagnostics were recovered. This artifact scatter may represent
the location of a short term campsite associated with hunter-gatherer exploitation of the riparian woodland
zone along Cypress and Little Cypress Creeks. Fluvial action has caused considerable erosion and redeposition of site soils/sediments according to shovel test profiles. The geoarcheological investigations
conducted at other sites in the project area indicate that 41HR971 is located in the Cypress Creek meander
belt (Appendix 2). Consequently, the archeological deposits may not be intact and the cultural materials
may not be in primary context. However, a more important consideration for Site 41HR971 is its extremely
low productivity and diversity. The site is unlikely to yield new information simply on the basis of its
paucity of cultural materials. Based on these factors, no additional work is recommended for this site. It is
considered as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as a State Archeological Landmark.

Site Description:
The site is located on the northern bank of Cypress Creek on the inside of a meander bend in Cypress Creek
(Figures 14-15). The precise location of site 41HR972 has been provided to TARL and the THC under
separate cover. Its dimensions are 135 m by 160 m and artifacts were recovered from 0-120 cm below
surface (Figure 14). The site is located on a series of four elevated topographic highs that appear to be
erosional remnants of a terrace or ridge-like feature. These topographic highs are situated adjacent to, and
north of, a low, flat, wetland-like depression. The eastern portion of the site has been disturbed by berms
associated with channel rectification and probably by erosion from an old meander scar and the present
channel of Cypress Creek (Figure 14). Other disturbance processes include treefall, logging, and
bioturbation.
The site area is heavily vegetated with oak, pine, and hackberry and a dense understory of privet, yaupon,
saplings, and vines (Figure 15). Surface visibility was non-existent due to heavy vegetative and/or leaf
cover. A total of 40 shovel tests were excavated during the course of site relocation, site delineation, and
site mapping. Subsoil or basal sandy clay was reached in 30 of the tests (see Appendix 4). Of the 40 tests,
13 were positive and the remaining 27 were negative (Figure 14). The site was defined by excavating two
consecutive negative tests in undisturbed areas and by the natural elevated landforms. The site is assumed
to extend beneath an existing berm towards Cypress Creek. (Figure 14). During the initial 2004
geoarcheological investigations, a backhoe trench (BHT 2) was excavated at the site. A second trench
(BHT 8) was excavated at a greater distance from the creek during the 2005 geomorphic investigation. A
permanent datum was established by nailing an aluminum tag inscribed with “MAC 03-56, Temp. site #9”
to a 50 cm diameter oak tree 50 cm above the ground (see Figure 14).
Artifact Discussion:
Artifacts recovered during the present survey include one drill/perforator and 2 Goose Creek Plain
sherds/sherdlets (see Table 1). A total of 1 secondary flake, 8 tertiary flakes, 18 flake fragments, and 5
pieces of flake debris were also recovered. No additional culture-historic diagnostics were recovered.
Recommendations:
Site 41HR972 is represented by a low density lithic/ceramic scatter contained within a 120 cm thick vertical
sandy deposit. However the majority of the cultural material was recovered from between 0 and 60 cm below
surface. Lithic tool diversity is very low and the only diagnostic material recovered was a small amount of
Goose Creek Plain pottery. A significant degree of erosion and re-deposition was considered probable based
on shovel test profiles and initial geoarcheological investigations (Appendix 2). However, the conclusion that
archeological deposits at Site 41HR972 are probably not intact and that the cultural materials may not be in
primary context was contradicted strongly by additional geomorphic investigation (Appendix 3). Backhoe
Trench 8 revealed a soil sequence interpreted as essentially intact by Dr. Carson, and exposed another
charcoal-flecked potential hearth feature. Site 41HR972 is now considered potentially eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP or designation as a State Archeological Landmark. Further investigation is recommended if Site

33

41HR972 cannot be successfully avoided and protected from detention basin impacts as currently planned by
the Harris County Flood Control District.

Site Description
The site is located about 180 m east of Cypress Creek within a relatively flat, forested environment
(Figures 16-17). Several locations within the site boundary are at slightly higher elevation than the
surrounding terrain and these are interpreted as erosional remnants of the pre-existing landform (Figure16).
The precise location of site 41HR974 has been provided to TARL and the THC under separate cover. The
site dimensions are 115 m by 115 m and artifacts were recovered from 0-70 cm below surface (Figure16).
Disturbance processes include treefall, logging, and bioturbation. The site area is subject to sheet wash as
indicated by low lying, shallow water course paths. A basin-shaped palmetto flat occurs adjacent to the
northeast site boundary (see Figure 16).
The site area is heavily vegetated with large pines as well as oak and elm along with a fairly thick
understory of yaupon, saplings, briars, and vines (Figure 17). Surface visibility was non-existent due to
heavy vegetative and/or leaf cover. A total of 27 shovel tests were excavated during the course of site
discovery, site delineation, and site mapping. Subsoil or basal clay was reached in all of the tests (Appendix
4). Six were positive and the remaining 22 were negative (see Figure 16). The site was defined by
excavating two consecutive negative tests in undisturbed areas and by the natural elevated landforms. A

permanent datum was established by nailing an aluminum tag inscribed with “MAC 03-56, Site 41HR974”
to a 31 cm diameter oak tree 50 cm above the ground (see Figure 16).
Artifact Discussion:
Artifacts recovered during the present survey include 2 secondary flakes, 1 tertiary flake, 5 flake fragments,
and 1 piece of flake debris. No culture-historic diagnostics were recovered, including ceramics.
Recommendations:
Site 41HR974 appears to represent the remnants of a short term campsite associated with hunter-gatherer
exploitation of the riparian woodland zone along Cypress and Little Cypress Creeks. The site is represented
by a very low density lithic scatter contained within a 70 cm thick vertical sandy deposit. Artifacts were
confined to the upper 60 cm of site deposits. No stone tools or ceramics were found. The site is thus
extremely limited in terms of artifact density and variability, and as such offers little potential to yield new
information. Based on these factors, additional work is not recommended at this site. The site is considered
to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as a State Archeological Landmark.

Isolated Find
A single isolated find was made during the course of survey. It consisted of two Goose Creek Plain
sherdlets found in Levels 5 and 6 of shove test 118. An additional 9 shovel tests were dug around the initial
positive but nothing else was found.

37

Summary and Recommendations
No further work is recommended for newly recorded sites 41HR971 or 41HR974. The general lack of
culture-historic diagnostics, ubiquity of some degree of bioturbation in sandy matrix sites, as well as the
low rates of artifact density and diversity indicate that further work at these sites would most likely be
uninformative. Evidence for reworking and re-deposition of site soil/sediment via erosion only serves to
reinforce this evaluation. Isolated Find 1 also does not warrant additional work. Sites 41HR339,
41HR366, 41HR970, and 41HR972, in contrast, have been confirmed by backhoe trenching to exhibit
intact strata that include probable cultural features (hearths). While artifact diversity and productivity at
sites 41HR339, 41HR970, and 41HR972 is relatively low, demonstrated site integrity suggests that these
sites, as well as 41HR366, are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places and for designation as
State Archeological Landmarks.
Site 41HR366 which now incorporates site 41HR338, is clearly the most important site identified in the
current survey. The site is large, highly productive, and complex, and its significance was further
confirmed by backhoe trenching. While some areas of 41HR366 appear to contain reworked and/or redeposited sediments, other areas clearly remain somewhat intact. Vandalism at the site poses a significant
threat to these sites’ intact cultural deposits. Additional work would be required to mitigate any adverse
impacts that result from the construction of the detention basin. Alternatively, Harris County Flood Control
District has proposed reducing the size of the planned detention basin in order to completely avoid
impacting site 41HR366, as well as sites 41HR339, 41HR970, and 41HR972. We suggest that the
establishment of a minimum 20 m buffer zone around the known site limits should be sufficient to prevent
adverse impacts to the site from detention basin-related construction activities, as well as from natural
erosion processes. Engineers from Harris County Flood Control District have prepared documentation of
construction methods to accompany this revised draft that will demonstrate that the sites will remain intact
both during construction and during the lifetime of the detention basin.
In the event that unknown archeological deposits or features are encountered during construction, it is
advised that construction cease in the immediate area of the finds and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

APPENDIX 1
ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC AND LITHIC ARTIFACTS FROM THE
CYPRESS CREEK-LITTLE CYPRESS CREEK DETENTION BASIN PROJECT,
HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS
H. Blaine Ensor

INTRODUCTION
A moderate-sized sample (N=494) of lithic and ceramic material was recovered during Phase I shovel test
survey at sites located within a proposed flood control detention basin area near the confluence of Cypress
Creek and Little Cypress Creek, northern Harris County, Texas. All materials are from shovel tests and
recovered by dry screening through ¼ inch mesh except for 8 sherds that were found in the backdirt of a
pothole or looter’s hole at site 41HR366. The present analysis focuses on describing the materials
recovered from the sites. The analysis includes all flaked stone and use-modified artifacts (N=21), sherds or
sherdlets (N=34), and other rock and fired clay (N=5). The ceramic total includes mended sherds from all
sites. Debitage or flake debris (N=434) was also analyzed in detail. The reader is referred to Chapter 5;
Table 1 for a complete inventory of materials recovered, including the debitage from the sites.

METHODS
Lithic Analysis
All formal/use-modified stone tools or implements from the sites were classified and described by raw
material type and each material type was described according to selected attributes including color, texture,
luster, patination, fossiliferous inclusions, presence or absence of heat treatment, and overall quality. All
color descriptions were made using a standard Geologic Society rock-color chart (Geological Society of
America 1984).
The specimens were classified on the basis of overall form and technology, including nature of the original
blank (pebble, flake, blade etc.), as well as placement and extent of flaking or grinding. Aspects of
morphology and technology are described for each category. Manufacture errors were identified as
appropriate and related to a specific reduction stage wherever possible.
Flake debris or debitage analysis may also be used to examine variability in lithic reduction practices at a
site. Use of methods advocated by Raab et al. (1979), Patterson (1982, 1990), and Morrow (1984) allow
potential recognition of different tool reduction strategies. When a combination of flake-size grading and
selected attributes are used (Ensor 1987, 1998), it is often possible to distinguish between core reduction,
biface manufacture, and refurbishing or resharpening. This, in turn, is useful in interpreting the inferred
range of site activities and frequency and duration of occupation.
All debitage (whole flakes and flake fragments) from site T-5 were size-graded through a series of five
nested geologic sieves: 1 inch (25 mm), 3/4 inch (19 mm), 2 inch (12.5 mm), 3/8 inch (9.5 mm), and 1/4
inch (6.3 mm). Flakes were hand-manipulated through each sieve. In addition, within each screen size,
flakes and flake fragments were classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary dependent upon the amount of
dorsal cortex present. Primary flakes are those that possess at least 90 percent cortical material on their
dorsal surface and platform. Secondary flakes retain less than 90 percent cortex while tertiary flakes retain
no cortex. Debitage from all sites was examined under low (10x) power magnification for evidence of use.
Specimens that show definite indication of use are described below. All flakes, flake fragments, and shatter
from the sites were analyzed, typed as to stage of reduction, raw material, and counted.

46

Ceramic Analysis
All prehistoric sherds or sherdlets were washed and sieved through a 1/2 inch (12.5 mm) U.S.A. Standard
Testing Sieve. Specimens were hand-manipulated through the sieve to insure consistency and objectivity.
After size-grading, all sherdlets (sherds <1/2 inch in size) were counted by temper or aplastic inclusions by
individual shovel test and level. All specimens were examined under low power magnification using
similar lighting conditions. A fresh break or surface was made, as necessary, on each sherd or sherdlet to
determine the nature of the tempering agent and/or aplastic inclusions of the pastes. Exterior and interior
colors were described using a Munsell Color Chart and the nature of surface treatment or finish was also
described for each sherd. Only sherds greater than ½ inch in size were analyzed in detail. These sherds
were classified according to established regional type-variety nomenclature (cf. Aten 1983; Ensor 1995;
1998). They were measured using metric hand calipers. Maximum thickness of each body sherd was taken
to the nearest tenth of a millimeter. All sherdlets were examined in sufficient detail to identify any unusual
or diagnostic specimens, i.e. coil fragments, handle fragments, clay lumps, ceramic types not recognized in
the sherd sample, and. painted sherds. All plain, non-diagnostic sherdlets were identified by paste/temper
category. The sherds recovered (>1/2 inch) are described in detail below.

Raw Material: Silicified wood, moderate yellowish brown (10YR5/4) in color with medium dark gray
(N4) streaks.
Form: Parallel sided, tapered at proximal end.
Technology: Hard hammer percussion thinning with possibly some secondary retouch on stem or haft.
Appears that a rudimentary haft element was formed.
Comments: This specimen appears to represent a dart point preform that was abandoned during
manufacture. It may have been intended as a Kent point but this is unclear. No estimate of age or cultural
affiliation is possible other than it is probably a Late Archaic to Early Ceramic period artifact.
Category 2. Arrow Point Preform (see Figure18).
Lot No: 16
Provenience: STP182, Level 5, 40-50 cmbs
Metric Data: Maximum Length 18.7 mm; Maximum Width 19.0 mm; Maximum Thickness 3.2 mm.
Raw Material: Silicified Wood, very dusky red (10R2/2) in color.
Form: Triangular.
Technology: Unifacial percussion edging and thinning with no secondary retouch is present on a thin flake.
It appears that two percussion blows applied to the base have created a rudimentary contracting haft
element.

52

Comments: This specimen appears to represent an arrow point preform, possibly for a Late Prehistoric
Perdiz Cluster form. If this is true, it may date between A.D. 1200 and A.D. 1700 in Southeast Texas
(Ensor 1990). Hall (1981) places Perdiz points into the Late Ceramic period after A.D. 950.
Category 3. Utilized Flake (Not Illustrated)
Lot No: 17
Provenience: STP 182, Level 6, 50-60 cmbs

bifacial thinning blade-like flake.

41HR972
Category 1. Bifacial Flake Drill/Perforator (N=1) (see Figure 18).
Lot No: 7
Provenience: STP 99, Level 6, 50-60 cmbs
Metric Data: Maximum Length 29.0 mm; Maximum Width 13.0 mm; Maximum Thickness 2.4 mm; Bit
Length 16.0 mm; Bit Width 4.5 mm; Bit Thickness 2.0 mm.
Raw Material: Very dark red chert (10R2/6) in color, glossy, heat treated.
Form: Amorphous, pointed.
Technology: This complete tool appears to have been made on a blade-like flake. A prepared striking
platform is present and the original blank appears to have been long and thin. A very small patch of alluvial
cortex remains. It is probable that the blank originated from a prepared core of some type. The thin, narrow
working end has been formed by bifacial pressure retouch. The delicate nature of the “bit” or working end
indicates that it may have been used as a perforator. The tip has been slightly fractured.
Comments: This specimen likely represents a drill or perforator, possibly associated with a Late
Prehistoric component. Similar “flake drills” have been found at site 41PS58 in Presidio County, Texas
(Darwin Hill Collection) (in Mallouf 1987, pp. 65). If it is related to Late Prehistoric occupation, it may
date between A.D. 1200 and A.D. 1700.

INITIAL GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Eric C. Carson, Ph.D.
Geoarchaeological investigations were undertaken in conjunction with two pedestrian cultural
resources surveys conducted in adjacent areas along Cypress Creek, in northwest Harris County,
Texas. The two project areas consisted of a 118-acre property (Antiquities Permit No. 3114,
HCFCD Unit K500-01-00-Y001; referred to in the following text as MAC 04-97) located near the
confluence of Cypress Creek and Little Cypress Creek, and a 45-acre property (Antiquities Permit
No. 3514, HCFCD Unit K500-01-00-R001; referred to in the following text as MAC 04-90
[Driver 2004]) located immediately downstream from MAC 04-97.
The geomorphic
investigations for these two distinct projects are presented in a single report due to their
proximity, relevance to one another, and the fact that geomorphic fieldwork for the two HCFCD
projects was conducted simultaneously.
A total of eight backhoe trenches (BHT) were profiled: two from MAC 04-90 (BHTs 1-2) and six
from MAC 04-97 (BHTs 1-6). The trenches from the MAC 04-90 area are located in a
fundamentally different landscape position than the trenches from MAC 04-97, and the
differences between these landscape positions controls the likelihood of finding in situ
archaeological deposits (Figure A2-1).

MAC 04-90 (HCFCD Unit K500-01-00-R001; Antiquities Permit No. 3514)
The two trenches from MAC 04-90 are both located at least 50 m northwest of the modern
channel of Cypress Creek (BHT 1 is significantly farther from the stream than 50 m). There is a
slight topographic depression 50 to 100 m to the south and southwest of 04-90 Trench #2; it
apparently is occupied as a slough during high discharge conditions, and may represent an
abandoned, filled ancient stream channel. The soils at both trenches are interpreted to represent
the Clodine Loam; they are yellowish brown to brown fine sandy loam that grades downward into
extremely dense mottled silty clay to silty clay loam that contains few to abundant clay-rich
lamellae within 1 m of the ground surface (Figures A2-2 and 3). This dense mottled silty clay
loam is interpreted to be the Lissie Formation that underlies the area. It is defined by its
extremely dense composition; the backhoe could only penetrate the material with great difficulty,
and shovel excavation would be incredibly tedious. The general landscape position of these two
trenches is located at the extreme right of the idealized cross-section shown in Figure A2-1.

MAC 04-97 (HCFCD Unit K500-01-00-Y001; Antiquities Permit No. 3114)
The six trenches from MAC 04-97 are all located immediately adjacent to the modern,
channelized Cypress Creek in close association with historic berms erected during dredging of
Cypress Creek. Several of the trenches, in fact, were excavated into the flank of the berms that
face away from Cypress Creek; in these trenches, the modern fill is identified as the surface A
horizon, and the soil that developed under natural conditions prior to berm construction is
identified as a buried soil. These trenches display a soil interpreted to be part of the Voss Soil
that is typically found in close association with modern streams. The soils (excluding the historic
berm fill) are characterized by brown to grayish brown sandy loam that grades downward into
massive yellowish brown sand that contains intermittent bioturbation, lamellae, and laminations
(Figures A2-4 through 9). Even though each of the six trenches from this area is deeper than
either of the two trenches from MAC 04-90, none of the trenches in the MAC 04-97 area intersect
the underlying Lissie Formation. BHT 6 is located ~5 m away from the north bank of Little
Cypress Creek, and in the creek bed the Lissie Formation is exposed ~4 m below the ground
surface at the top of the bank (Little Cypress Creek and Cypress Creek have been dredged to an
elevation lower than the natural stream bed elevation, which has made the banks unnaturally high
and exposed the Lissie Formation in the creek beds). The general landscape position of these six
trenches is located in the central portion of the idealized cross-section shown in Figure A2-1,
directly to the right of the historic berms.

Discussion
It is important to note in terms of discussion that the six Appendix 2 backhoe trenches in MAC 0497 (Antiquities Permit No. 3114) were located in landscape positions between previously
identified sites and the modern channel. This was in accordance with our understanding of the
letter from the Texas Historical Commission to Douglas Mangum dated December 29, 2003,
which stated that “…backhoe trenching should be utilized to examine, sample, and document the
stream-side, bermed, and filled-over portions of 41HR339, 41HR336 [sic; actually site
41HR366], 41HR970, and 41HR972”. The trench placement and evaluation that follows was
therefore designed specifically to address the explicit THC-requested information: whether MAC
04-97 sites 41HR339, 41HR336, 41HR970, and 41HR972 continue toward the modern channel.
We thus considered ourselves restricted to evaluating the context of the deposits exposed in these
trenches rather than to determine whether the originally sampled (shovel tested) portions of these
four sites represented in situ artifact collections. Further consultation with THC resulted in a
mandate from that agency to conduct additional trenching at more inland portions of the sites.
The results of this additional trenching, which differed significantly from those near the stream
channel, are reported in Appendix 3 following.
Most of the italicized amendments and additions to Appendix 2 appearing below are responses to
specific comments from THC regarding the previous draft.
The study location has experienced some level of anthropogenic channel modification during the
20th century, including channel straightening, channel dredging (to increase depth below
floodplain surface), and berm construction. Prior to human development of the area, Cypress
Creek was a naturally meandering stream. This interpretation derives from the occurrence of
several abandoned channel meanders that are evident on the land surface. There is a prominent
partially-infilled oxbow (abandoned meander) approximately 100 m downstream from the
confluence of Little Cypress and Cypress Creeks. While it is undetermined whether this stretch of
channel was abandoned from natural cutoff or during artificial channel straightening, visual
inspection of the oxbow confirms that it contains fining-upward sediments on the point bar and a
steep-sloped (nearly vertical) cutbank—features that are consistent with a meandering stream.
More ephemeral features associated with meandering streams (such as crevasse splays, natural
levees, etc…) were not identified in the study area; this is interpreted to reflect the amount of
land-surface modification that has occurred during the 20th century.
Meandering streams, such as Cypress Creek is interpreted to be, migrate laterally across the
floodplain through time as sediments are eroded from the outer bank of stream bends (cutbanks)
and simultaneously deposited on the inner bank of stream bends (point bars). During periods of
overbank flooding, additional sediments are deposited on the surface of the adjacent landscape
that is inundated by floodwaters. Thus through time, a meandering stream tends to rework a
broad swath (10s to 100s of meters, depending on the size of the stream) of sediment. This zone
of reworked deposits is referred to as a ‘meander belt.’ Sediments are never excavated wholesale
from the meander belt, but through time sediments are reworked within the meander belt by the
process of lateral channel migration. Any single location will experience vertical accretion from
overbank deposition through time, until (and if) it is eroded by a laterally migrating channel
cutbank. When this occurs, point bar sediments are deposited at the same location relatively
soon after erosion by the cutbank as channel migration continues.
Within this meander belt, alluvial sediments are constantly transported and re-deposited along the
banks of the stream. These processes are illustrated in the idealized cross-section above (Figure
A2-1), showing the area of the meander belt and the nearby areas where the Lissie Formation has

70

not been eroded by the stream. The Lissie Formation within the study area is particularly easy to
identify due to how extremely dense and compacted it is. While some Quaternary alluvial
sediments (particularly Unit III) was described as ‘dense’, the Lissie Formation was dense and
compacted to the point that the backhoe had great difficulty in excavating it. This further
illustrates the similarity of the natural A-horizons of soils both near Cypress Creek and farther
removed from Cypress Creek, as each location has experienced overbank flood alluvial
deposition.
Prehistoric meander propagation of Cypress Creek (lateral migration of the channel, with
associated cutbank-and-point bar deposition and erosion) has likely reworked the sandy alluvium
on multiple occasions through the Holocene. Lateral migration of the channel across the
floodplain would erode sediments from the cutbanks and deposit reworked alluvial sediments on
the adjacent point bar. The sediments being deposited on the point bars certainly contained a
significant component of sediments that had been eroded at upstream cutbanks, which may
therefore contain a component of cultural artifacts eroded from upstream locations. The longterm effect of this channel migration would be creation of a meander belt (an area along the axis
of the floodplain where alluvial sediments are susceptible to reworking by the channel). This is
evidenced by the greater depth to the top of the Lissie Formation for trenches near the creek
compared to trenches far from the creek; the relatively poor development of A horizons (or buried
A horizons, for trenches that intersect the historic berms) in trenches in close proximity to the
modern channel; and the massive, sandy texture of the C horizons in trenches near the creek.
The trenches in MAC 04-97 (Antiquities Permit No. 3114) are all located in the Voss sand, which
is classified as high geoarchaeological preservation potential (Abbott, 2001). As meander
propagation continued through the Holocene, any individual site would either be preserved in
situ if it was never eroded by a channel, or it would be eroded as a channel migrated across the
site. I would therefore interpret that MAC 04-97 BHTs 5 and 6—and sites such as 41HR366—
represent locations that have not experienced channel-margin erosion since occupation, whereas
the MAC 04-97 BHTs 1 through 4 represent sediments that have been reworked by alluvial
processes at some time during the Holocene. Because alluvial reworking is most common along
the axis of the floodplain, it is much more likely that any archaeological artifacts found within the
meander belt close to the axis of the floodplain (which is often close to the modern channel) have
been eroded from locations farther upstream, transported by alluvial processes, and re-deposited
within the sandy meander belt sediments.
As one moves downstream from the confluence of Little Cypress Creek and Cypress Creek, the
width of the meander belt typically increases; this is shown by the width of Quaternary alluvium
(see Figure A3-10) increasing downstream from the confluence of these two streams. This raises
the possibility that BHTs 5 and 6 (at site 41HR366) may represent a geomorphic position at the
margin of the meander belt or a location that has simply not been eroded during the Holocene by
a meandering channel, where it is more likely to find in situ artifacts. The actual width of the
meander belt could only be determined by probing to find areas of the floodplain that have 3 or
more meters of alluvial sediment over the Lissie Formation (these would be areas within the
meander belt) versus areas of the floodplain where the Lissie Formation is within 1 meter of the
floodplain surface (these would be areas outside the meander belt). The eight BHTs that were
dug in MAC 04-90 and 04-97 only delineate between the six BHTs in MAC 04-97(Antiquities
Permit No. 3114) that are within the meander belt and the two BHTs from MAC 04-90
(Antiquities Permit No. 3514) that are outside the meander belt.
However, BHT 4 (also at site 41HR366) is located immediately adjacent to the modern channel,
suggesting that it is located within the meander belt of Cypress Creek in a geomorphic position

71

likely dominated by reworking of alluvial sediments. This interpretation is corroborated by the
physical appearance of a ceramic sherd found during the excavation of BHT 4, the trench placed
adjacent to Cypress Creek in the southern end of site 41HR366. The sherd, which was examined
by the Project Archeologist and the geomorphologist but regrettably not collected, showed
evidence of alluvial transportation: water- and sand-abraded surfaces and smoothed, rounded
edges. BHTs 1, 2, and 3 (in MAC 04-97) are located farther downstream along Cypress Creek, in
an area where the Quaternary alluvium (Figure A2-10) and the meander belt for Cypress Creek
are likely much wider than at the confluence of Little Cypress Creek and Cypress Creek. This
indicates that these three trenches—and the associated archaeological sites 41HR339, 41HR972,
and 41HR970—are without doubt located within recently deposited alluvium. It is my
professional opinion that BHTs 1 through 4 very likely represent relatively poor
geoarchaeological preservation potential due to the likelihood that the areas have been reworked
by lateral channel migration at some during the Holocene since prehistoric occupation of the
region.
The characteristics of the soils from these trenches, the landscape position within the prehistoric
meander belt of Cypress Creek, and the characteristics of artifacts from the backhoe trenches
(which indicate that the artifacts have been transported and are not, in fact, in situ) all strongly
suggest that downstream of the confluence of the two streams there is fundamentally no potential
to preserve archaeological artifacts in context in close proximity to the stream channel. In
contrast, BHTs 5 and 6 from MAC 04-97 and BHTs 1 and 2 from MAC 04-90, appear to be
located outside the margin of the meander belt of Cypress Creek, and consequently, represent a
more stable geomorphic surface that may contain in situ artifacts. Similar results suggesting
stable deposits with the potential for in situ artifacts and features were obtained from the
additional inland trenching described in Appendix 3.

ADDITIONAL GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS (2005)
COMMENTS ON SITE TESTING TRENCHES
Eric C. Carson, Ph.D.
Discussion
These four 2005 backhoe trenches (BHTs 7-10) have been situated within the defined boundaries
of four prehistoric sites within the project area, and complement the trenches excavated during
2004. BHT 7 is located within site 41HR339; BHT 8 is located within site 41HR972; BHT 9 is
located within site 41HR970; and BHT 10 is located within site 41HR366. The locations of these
trenches are depicted on the individual site maps, on Figure 5, and on Figure A3-5 below.
The position of BHTs 7–10 provides the ability to address different issues than those addressed
by BHTs 1–6. The initial six trenches were situated between the identified occupation sites and
the margins of Cypress and Little Cypress Creek. The trenches were specifically situated to
address whether the occupation sites extended toward Cypress Creek and Little Cypress Creek.
The generally massive nature of the sediments in the initial trenches suggested that the sediments
had been reworked by fluvial processes, and that any artifacts within those trenches were not
likely to be in situ. That conclusion remains valid for the areas proximal to creek channels
sampled by the trenches in Appendix 2.
BHTs 7–10 described herein are situated farther back from the margins of the channel and within
the boundaries of the prehistoric occupation sites. The location of these four trenches allow
investigation of whether the occupation sites, which were originally identified based on shovel
test pits, are intact and represent artifacts that are in situ. These trenches exhibit a greater amount
of zonation than that found in BHTs 1–6, particularly in the sediments below the surface A
horizon. Lamellae, fine laminations, fine stratification, mottling, and iron staining are common in
BHTs 7–10 beneath the A horizon. The contacts between the various strata are generally clear
and distinct. Each of these backhoe trenches exhibit zones that contain concentrations of
charcoal, which was not evident in BHTs 1–6. Each of these new trenches contains concentrated
ash and charcoal features that have tentatively been interpreted as hearths. All of these features
indicate that the sediments described in BHTs 7–10 are likely intact (as opposed to the likely reworked and re-deposited sediments found in BHTs 1–6 immediately adjacent to the stream
channels), an interpretation that is strongly confirmed by the multiple intact hearth features found
at depth within the trenches.
A 25-X-25 cm column sample in the trench wall was hand excavated and screened through ¼-in
hardware cloth in addition to the profile description for each of the four new backhoe trenches.
The artifacts recovered in these column samples are enumerated in Tables A3-1 and A3-2 below.
