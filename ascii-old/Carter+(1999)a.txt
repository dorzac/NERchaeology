Geologic Overview: Okfuskee, Muskogee and Le Flore Counties
Jennifer A. Lepper and Kenneth Lepper
On Saturday we will visit sites within the Osage Plains of the Central Lowlands
physiographic province that lies south of the maximum Pleistocene glacial limit. The
Osage Plains are formed predominantly on Permian and Pennsylvanian shales. The
Quaternary history of this region is the history of river migration and associated land
surface modification. On Sunday we will visit the Lake Wister area in the Ouachita
Mountains of the Interior Highlands physiographic province. These Ouachita Mountains
are the western most extension of the Appalachians where folded early Paleozoic rocks
have eroded to form a landscape similar to the "Valley and Ridge" region of
Pennsylvania. Additional information about the Quaternary and bedrock geology of
these areas can be found in thorough reviews by Madole et al. (1991)[1] and Johnson et
al. (1989)[4].

Saturday Morning April 17'h , 1999;
Okfuskee County.
Stops 1 and 2: The Ash sites, are
located in southern Okfuskee County
OK. The county lies within the Eastern
Sandstone Cuesta Plains geomorphic
province of Oklahoma [2] in the Central
Lowlands physiographic province [1].
The bedrock of the Sandstone Cuesta
Plains is comprised of Pennsylvanianaged shales with interbedded with
sandstone, limestone, and coal [3]. The
Paleozoic strata have a low-angle
westward dip. The sandstones are more
resistant than the other rock types and
form (cuestas) ridges that overlook
broad valleys of less-resistant shales.
Precambrian rhyolitic rocks underlie the
paleozoic marine sediments and form the
basement rocks [4]. The Lava Creek B
and Bishop Ash lentils are located within
Quaternary terrace deposits of the North
Canadian River. The Bishop Ash is
older than the Lava Creek B ash, and
hence, is found stratigraphically higher
in the terrace sequence. Ash Sites 1 and
2 are located in the Cross Timbers land
resource area of Oklahoma [5]. Residual

and alluvial soils dominate the county,
however, localized eolian soils can be
found as well [6]. Additional discussion
of soils and Quaternary geology will be
given at the sites.
Saturday Afternoon April 17'\ 1999;
Muskogee County.
Stops 3 and 4:
The mima
mounds and sodic soil sites are in the
western portion of Muskogee County
OK. The county lies at the transition
between the Central Lowlands and
Interior
Highlands
physiographic
provinces [1]. The western portion of
the county is in the Claremore Cuesta
of
Plains
geomorphic
province
Oklahoma [2].
The sandstone and
limestone layers are more prominent in
the bedrock underlying Muskogee
County although it is still dominated by
westward dipping Pennsylvanian shales
[2,3].
Coal beds are also more
expansive beneath Muskogee County
than Okfuskee. The basement rocks
remain Precambrian Rhyolite [4].
Muskogee County is almost entirely

with in the Cherokee Plains land
resource area of Oklahoma [5].
Discussion of soils and Quaternary
geology will be given at the sites.

Le Flore County - Lake Wister Area.
The geology of the Lake Wister
area is considerably more dynamic than
that of the adjacent Central Lowlands.
Le Flore County and the Ouachita
Mountains lie within the Interior
Highlands Physiographic province and
are an extension of the folded
Appalachians.
Deformed
early
Paleozoic rocks have eroded to form a
landscape similar to the "Valley and
Ridge"
region
of Pennsylvania.
Paleozoic marine platform sediments
(sandstone and shale) were folded by a
tectonic event that occurred during the
Pennsylvanian [7]. The rocks of the
Ouchitas were structurally compressed,
folded and thrust faulted. The Choctaw
fault is the major thrust fault near Lake
Wister; it trends NE-SW along the
Ouchita front [7].
The Heavener
anticline is the most significant feature
of the Lake Wister area. Lake Wister
dam is built on the north-trending limb
of the
Heavener anticline
[7].
Quaternary alluvium is a significant
valley deposit in this region. Soils in this
county are more varied as they are
formed on a more complex blanket of
parent materials.
Soil types are
primarily
colluvial,
alluvial,
and
residual.

A BRIEF GEOLOGIC HISTORY OF OKLAHOMA
observe and collect a great number of fossils, rocks,
and minerals that are unavailable in any other
part of Oklahoma.
The principal sites of sedimentation were in
great elongate basins that subsided more rapidly
than adjacent areas and received sediments
10,000-40,000 ft thick. The major sedimentary
basins were confined to the southern half of the
State and include the Anadarko, Arkoma, Ardmore, Marietta, and Hollis basins, and the
Ouachita basin in the site of the present Ouachita
Mountains (Fig. 1).
Rocks of every geologic period (Fig. 2) crop out
in Oklahoma, and thus a great variety of fossils
can be found in the State. Nearly 99% of Oklahoma's outcropping rocks are of sedimentary
origin, and the remainder are: igneous rocks in the
Wichita Mountains; igneous and metamorphic
rocks in part of the Arbuckle Mountains; and an
area of mildly metamorphosed rocks in the
Ouachita Mountains. Rocks of Permian age are
exposed at the land surface in about 46% of the
State (Fig. 3). The ages of other outcropping rocks
are Pennsylvanian (25%), Tertiary (11%), Cretaceous (7%), Mississippian (6%), Ordovician (1%),
and Cambrian (1%); Precambrian, Silurian, Devonian, Triassic, and Jurassic each crop out in less

INTRODUCTION

At many times in the past, forces within the
Earth resulted in portions of Oklahoma and
surrounding states alternately sinking below and
rising above sea level. At times, large areas were
covered by shallow seas, and thick layers of marine
shale, limestone, and sandstone were deposited. In
adjacent areas, at the same time, sandstones and
shales were laid down as alluvial and deltaic
deposits near the ancient seas. When these areas
later were elevated above the seas, the earlierdeposited rocks and sediments were exposed and
eroded, just as they are being eroded in today's
land areas. Uplift was accomplished either by
gentle arching of broad areas, or by the formation
of mountains where rocks were intensely folded,
faulted, and thrust upward.
Three principal mountain belts, the Ouachita,
Arbuckle, and Wichita Mountains, are in the
southern third of the State (Fig. 1). These were the
sites of folding, faulting, and uplifting during the
Pennsylvanian Period of geologic tiroe. In addition
to exposing a great variety of geologic structures,
these fold belts brought to the surface igneous
rocks and thick sequences of Paleozoic sediroentary
rocks seen at few other places in the Midcontinent
area. These uplifts also are the sites where one can

than 1% of the State. Not included in these
estimates are the younger Quaternary river, terrace, and lake deposits that overlie pre-Quaternary
rock in about 25% of the State.
PRECAMBRIAN AND CAMBRIAN
IGNEOUS ACTIVITY

The oldest known rocks in Oklahoma are
Precambrian granites and rhyolites formed 1.051.35 billion years ago; pre-existing rocks were
altered, destroyed, or consumed by igneous or
metamorphic activity. Much later, during the early
and middle parts of the Cambrian Period, a
different group of thick granites, rhyolites, gabbros, and basalts formed in southwestern and
south-central Oklahoma. Heat and fluids given off
by the Cambrian magmas changed an older group
of sedimentary rocks into metamorphic rocks. Precambrian and Cambrian igneous rocks underlie all
of the State and are the floor or "basement" upon
which younger rocks rest.
CAMBRIAN, ORDOVICIAN, SILURIAN, AND
DEVONIAN SEDIMENTATION

Shallow seas covered all of Oklahoma during
various parts of the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian Periods. Thick limestones and
dolomites are the most common rocks of these
periods, although several formations of sandstone

and shale also occur. Deposition of sedimentary
layers was quite uniform over vast areas of
Oklahoma and parts of surrounding states, and
thus individual rock formations are easily recognized and are widespread throughout the southern
Midcontinent region. These limestones and
sandstones are among the most prolific sources of
oil and gas in Oklahoma. Fossils are common in
many of the limestones, with brachiopods, trilobites, corals, and crinoids being most numerous. In
deep-water seas that covered the present Ouachita
Mountain area, however, shale, sandstone, and
chert were the principal deposits.
MISSISSIPPIAN AND PENNSYLVANIAN
SEDIMENTATION

During the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian
Periods, the sedimentary basins of Oklahoma sank
much deeper and more rapidly than before. Thick
sequences of shale, with interbedded sandstone
and limestone, were deposited in these basins, and
also in a deep basin that existed in the area of the
present Ouachita Mountains. Plants growing in
swamps near the edge of Pennsylvanian seas were
buried and have since decomposed to form coal.
Most major outcrops in the eastern half of Oklahoma are rocks of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian age. Many of the major oil and gas fields in
Oklahoma produce from Mississippian marine

A Brief Geologic History of Oklahoma-(Continued)
limestones and sandstones, and from Pennsylvanian deltaic or marine sandstones.
PENNSYLVANIAN MOUNTAIN BUILDING

The greatest period of mountain building in
Oklahoma was in Pennsylvanian time. Flat-lying
sedimentary rock layers in the southern half of the
State were sharply folded, tilted, and faulted;
earlier-formed igneous-rock masses were pushed
upward; and the three mountain chains (Ouachita,
Arbuckle, and Wichita Mountains) were thrust
high above surrounding seas. Gravel and boulders
eroded from the rising mountains were deposited
to form conglomerates at the foot of the mountains
and in the nearby seas.
Thus, by the end of the Pennsylvanian Period,
the mountain systems of Oklahoma were substantially as we know them today, although subsequent
gentle uplift and accompanying erosion have cut
more deeply into the cores of these mountains.
PERMIAN RED BEDS AND EvAPORlTES

Following the episode of mountain building, a
shallow sea covered western Oklahoma during the
Permian Period. The mountains were largely worn
down, and sand and mud eroded from land in the
eastern half of the State were carried by rivers
that flowed westward to the sea. The red color of
these Permian sandstones and shales comes from
red iron-oxide compounds deposited with the sand
and mud. The climate was warm and dry, and
thick layers of gypsum and salt were deposited
from evaporating sea water. White gypsum now
caps many of the hills, buttes, and escarpments in
western Oklahoma, and the stone is extensively
mined for making wallboard and plasters, and as
an additive in cement manufacture. The salt layers
underlie most of western Oklahoma, but locally
they are dissolved by natural ground-water flow
and the resultant brines come to the surface at
several salt plains.

TRIASSIC, JURASSIC, AND CRETACEOUS
SEDIMENTATION

Nonmarine shales and sandstones characterize
the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous sedimentary
rocks of Oklahoma. However, shallow seas covered
southern and western Oklahoma during some of
the Cretaceous Period, and this resulted in
deposition of marine limestone and shale. The
Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods
comprise the Mesozoic Era, the so-called "Age of
the Dinosaurs." Mesozoic rocks in Oklahoma have
yielded a number of fine dinosaur fossils over the
years. Uplift of the Rocky Mountains in Late
Cretaceous and Early Tertiary time caused
withdrawal of the sea from Oklahoma and
imparted an eastward tilt to the entire State.
TERTIARY PERIOD

Since the broad, gentle raising of Oklahoma
and surrounding areas above sea level at the
beginning of the Tertiary Period, no part of the
State has been covered by sea water. Oklahoma's
land surface sloped down to the east and southeast, and extensive deposits of Tertiary sand and
gravel were washed in by large rivers flowing from
the newly formed Rocky Mountains. Sediments
deposited across the western part of the State comprise the Ogallala Formation, which has become a
major ground-water aquifer serving agriculture
and municipal needs.
QUATERNARY PERIOD

The Quaternary Period, embracing the Ice
Ages up through the present, is characterized as a
time of erosion. Rocks and loose sediment at the
land surface are being weathered to soil, and the
soil particles then are carried away to streams and
rivers. In this way, hills and mountain areas are
being worn down, and sediment is carried to the
sea or is temporarily deposited on the banks and in
the bottoms of rivers and lakes.
Present-day topography and landforms are
largely controlled by the kinds of rocks at the
surface. Resistant rocks, such as granite, sandstone, and limestone, generally form high ridges,
hills, and mountain peaks, whereas nearby
outcrops of shale and other easily eroded rocks
form valleys and lowland areas.

A Decreased Rate of Incision by the North Canadian (Beaver) River in
Central Oklahoma After the Lava Creek B Volcanic Eruption (600 Ka)
Phillip A. Ward III and Brian J. Carter, Dept. of Plant and Soil Sciences,
Oklahoma State University
Volcanic ash from late Tertiary to mid-Pleistocene eruptions in the western
U.S. are within unconsolidated deposits in the middle reaches of the Arkansas
River basin (Ward et aI., 1993; Fig. 1). Ash from eruptions in the Yellowstone
Plateau Volcanic Field in northwestern Wyoming and east central Idaho
(Huckleberry Ridge--2.1 Ma, Mesa Falls--1.25 Ma, and Lava Creek B--0.6 Ma),
the Toledo and Valles calderas of the Jemez Mountains in central New Mexico
(Guaje (Lower Bandelier)--1.45 Ma and Tsankawi (Upper Bandelier)--1.15 Ma),
and the Long Valley caldera of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in eastern California
(Bishop--0.75 Ma) correlate with source eruptions based on fission-track age of
glass shards, chemical composition, and petrographic properties (morphology
and index of refraction of glass shards). The beds of ash are time markers for
interpretations of soil genesis (Carter et aI., 1990; Ward and Carter, 1998), net
rates of incision by streams (Ward and Carter, 1999), and landscape
development (Ward and Carter, 1999) within the middle reaches of the Arkansas
River basin.
The North Canadian (Beaver) River flows from headwaters in the High Plains
of the Texas Panhandle across Oklahoma from the northwest corner to the east
central part of the state (Fig. 1). The river joins the Canadian River in close
proximity to where the Canadian River flows into the Arkansas River (Fig. 1).
Residents of the Panhandle region of Oklahoma call the North Canadian
(Beaver) River the Beaver River. Several deposits of voicanic ash occur within
the N. Canadian (Beaver) River basin (Fig. 1). The net rate of incision by the N.
Canadian (Beaver) River in central Oklahoma decreased considerably during the
mid-to-Iate Pleistocene based on elevations and ages of 2 deposits of volcanic
ash in Okfuskee Co., Oklahoma. The objectives of this paper are to 1) report net
rates of incision by the N. Canadian (Beaver) River in Okfuskee Co. based on
age and elevations of 2 distinct deposits of volcanic ash, 2) present a reason for
the decrease in net rate of incision by the N. Canadian (Beaver) River in
Okfuskee Co., and 3) compare net rates of incision by the N. Canadian (Beaver)
River in Okfuskee Co. with rates of incision by other streams in the middle
reaches of the Arkansas River basin.
Okfuskee County is in the east central part of Oklahoma (Fig. 2) and is part of
the Cross Timbers Major Land Resource Area. Rocks of Pennsylvanian age
occur at or near the land surface throughout the county. Sandstone-capped
cuestas are a dominant feature of the landscapes of the county and stream
valleys of the county primarily incise shale. The major streams of the county are
the N. Canadian (Beaver) and the Deep Fork of the Canadian Rivers. The Deep
Fork River flows through the northern part of the county and the N. Canadian

(Beaver) River flows through the southern part of the county (Fig. 2). Pleistocene
and Holocene alluvial and eolian deposits cover the land surface in many places
in the county.
Materials and Methods

The deposits of volcanic ash used to determine the net rate of incision by the
N. Canadian (Beaver) River in Okfuskee Co. are within alluvium underlying
terraces of the river. Ash 30 is a Lava Creek B ash and is on the south side of
the river in sections 19 and 20, T10N, R10E (Figs. 2 and 3). The top of the ash
is at an elevation of -238 m and the river channel is at an elevation of -229 m
(Fig. 3). Ash 33 is a Bishop ash and is on the north side of the river in sections
34 and 35, T11 N, R10E (Fig. 2, 3 and 4). The top of the ash is at an elevation of
-244 m (Fig. 3). The correlation of Ash 33 as a Bishop Ash is the result of new
analyses that are the main topic of another paper in this guidebook. Ash 30 lies
below a mollisol with subsoil that is clayey, has strong structure, and rests on a
clayey mollisol with gleyed subsoil. Ash 33 is beneath a clayey alfisol and buries
clayey, gleyed sediment. Table 1 contains descriptions of the soil horizons
associated with the two volcanic ashes in the geologic sections containing the
ashes.
The net rates of incision represent the mean incision rate for the intervals
of time considered. Incision rates are calculated from the difference in elevation
between 2 locations (elevation at Ash 33 minus elevation at Ash 30, for example)
divided by the difference in age between the 2 locations (age of Ash 33 minus
age of Ash 30, for example). The measured rates of incision are reported in cm
per thousand years (cm/ky).
Results

Measurements of net rate of incision by the N. Canadian (Beaver) River in
Okfuskee Co. were made along five different transects (Figs 3 and 4). Four
measurements include Ash 33 as a time marker (Figs. 3 and 4) and 2
measurements include Ash 30 as a time marker (Fig. 3). The measured net
rates of incision by the N. Canadian (Beaver) R. in Okfuskee Co., OK include:

Discussion
The net rate of incision by the N. Canadian (Beaver) R. in Okfuskee, Co.
since the Lava Creek B eruption is between 1/2 and 1/3 as rapid as the rate of
incision for the river in the same area between the time of the Bishop eruption
and the time of the Lava Creek B eruption (Fig. 3). Ward and Carter (1999)
relate the slow net rates of incision by the N. Canadian (Beaver) River in central
Oklahoma to a stream capture that occurred along the ancestral N. Canadian
(Beaver) River sometime in the mid-Pleistocene. At Ash 32 (a Lava Creek Bash
in a similar landscape position as Ash 30; Figs. 1 and 5), several km downstream
from Okfuskee Co., the net rate of incision by the N. Canadian (Beaver) River is
also slow (2.5 cm/ky).
The Cimarron River and the N. Canadian (Beaver) River flowed as a major
Pleistocene drainage in western Oklahoma (Myers, 1962) until sometime after
the Lava Creek B eruption (Ward and Carter, 1999). Stream channel deposits
along the divide between the present-day N. Canadian (Beaver) and Cimarron
Rivers mark the location of the ancestral combined N. Canadian (Beaver)Cimarron River channel (Myers, 1962; Ward and Carter, 1999). The capture
occurred near the eastern edge of the Oklahoma Panhandle (Fig. 1) and the
section of the Cimarron River east of the capture point was the capturing stream.
Salt dissolution in the underlying bedrock was probably a major reason for the
capture. The capture took a major tributary of the N. Canadian (Beaver) River
and left the N. Canadian (Beaver) River as a severely underfit stream in a large
drainage basin filled with extensive amounts of alluvium. The river is still
severely underfit and the slow net rates of incision by the N. Canadian (Beaver)
River in central Oklahoma are evidence the capture had a major effect on the
river. The river has migrated -1 km laterally at Ashes 30 and 32 since eruption
of Lava Creek B ash (Figs 1, 3, and 5).
Comparisons of net rates of incision by the N. Canadian (Beaver) River in
central Oklahoma based on Lava Creek B ash with rates of incision based on
Bishop and Lava Creek B ash for other streams in the middle reaches of the
Arkansas River basin (Ward and Carter, 1999) indicate rates of incision by the N.
Canadian (Beaver) River in central Oklahoma after the Lava Creek B eruption
are some of the slowest in the region. Other streams in the middle reaches of
the Arkansas River that have incised slowly since the Bishop eruption include the
Arkansas River in the Great Bend region of central Kansas (Ash 8 (Bishop)-0.6
cm/ky and Ash 10 (Bishop )-2.1 cm/ky), the S. Fork of the Ninnescah River in the
Great Bend region (Ash 1 (Lava Creek B)-2.0 cm/ky), and the N. Canadian
(Beaver) River at a point a few km downstream from the N. Canadian (Beaver)
River-Cimarron River capture point (Ash 23 (Lava Creek B)-1.5 cm/ky) (Ward
and Carter, 1999; Fig. 1). The slowest incision rates in the middle reaches of the
Arkansas River basin occur downstream from a point of stream capture that
involved the loss of a major tributary to a stream.
The fastest measured net rate of stream incision in the middle reaches of the
Arkansas River basin (9.7 cm/ky) is for the Canadian River in western Oklahoma.

The Lava Creek B ash (Ash 13; Fig. 1) this rate of incision is measured from is a
short distance downstream from the point where a downstream tributary of the
Canadian River captured and diverted the Canadian River. The channel of the
capturing tributary was possibly much more deeply incised than the channel the
Canadian River was flowing in at the time of the capture and the net rate of
incision by the Canadian River increased significantly at the time of the capture.
The Salt Fork of the Arkansas River has also incised at a rate of 9.7 cm/ky in
northwestern Oklahoma. This rate is measured from a Lava Creek B ash (Ash
31; Fig. 1) several km upstream from the point of capture where the capturing
stream diverted the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River to an entirely different
drainage basin. This capture is similar to the capture on the Canadian River near
Ash 13 because the capturing stream was possibly much more deeply incised
than the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River. Other streams that have incised more
rapidly than the N. Canadian (Beaver) River in central Oklahoma since the Lava
Creek B eruption include Bluff Creek (4.6 cm/ky) in southwestern Kansas, the
Cimarron River (5.1 cm/ky) in the Oklahoma Panhandle, Kiowa Creek (4.6 cm
Iky) in western Oklahoma, and the Canadian River (8.6 cm/ky) in central
Oklahoma. The rate of incision for Bluff Creek is measured from a Lava Creek B
ash (Ash 9; Fig.1) in the Cimarron River basin several km downstream from the
N. Canadian (Beaver) River-Cimarron River point of capture. The rate of incision
for the Cimarron River in the Oklahoma Panhandle is measured from a Lava
Creek B ash (Ash 18); Fig. 1) a few km upstream from the N. Canadian (Beaver)
River-Cimarron River point of capture. A rate of incision for Kiowa Creek is
measured from a Lava Creek B ash several km downstream from the N.
Canadian (Beaver) River-Cimarron River point of capture but several km
upstream from the mouth of Kiowa Creek. The rate of incision for the Canadian
River in central Oklahoma is measured from a Lava Creek B ash (Ash 34; Figs. 1
and 6) in a similar landscape position as Ash 13. Fay (1959) suggests the type
of capture that occurred near Ash 13 may have occurred around the same time
at other locations in the Canadian River basin downstream from the capture point
near Ash 13. Stream captures have significantly affected the development of
landscapes in the middle reaches of the Arkansas River basin.
Landscapes containing Pleistocene ash in other parts of eastern Oklahoma
have similar rolling-type topography as the ash-containing landscapes of
Okfuskee Co. (Figs. 1, 5, 6, and 7). The correlation of Ash 44 (Figs. 1 and 7) with
a source eruption is incomplete.

Field Trip Stops 1 and 2
Revised Correlations of Volcanic Ash in the Middle Reaches of the
Arkansas River Basin
Phillip A. Ward III and B. J. Carter, Dept. of Plant and Soil Sciences,
Oklahoma State University
Layers of volcanic ash within unconsolidated sediments of the middle reaches
of the Arkansas River basin were previously correlated with late Tertiary to midPleistocene eruptions of volcanic calderas in the western U.S. (Ward et aI., 1993;
Fig. 1). Previous correlation was based on fission-track ages, inductively
coupled argon plasma spectrophotometry analyses (ICP), x-ray fluorescence
analyses (XRF), and petrographic analyses (index of refraction and morphology)
of fine-sand-size shards of glass from the ash. Data from instrumental neutron
activation analyses (INAA) of shards of glass from the ash has recently become
available. A revision of the previous correlation of the ashes in the middle
reaches of the Arkansas River basin is necessary based on the results of a
cluster analysis (SAS, 1980) that includes the INAA data with some of the data
used in the original correlation.
Volcanic ash in the middle reaches of the Arkansas River basin correlates
with several source eruptions in the western U.S. These are:
Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field (northwestern Wyoming and eastern Idaho)
Huckleberry Ridge--2.1 Ma (million years ago)
Mesa Falls--1.25 Ma
Lava Creek B--0.6 Ma
Jemez Mountains (Toledo and Valles calderas, central New Mexico)
Guaje (Lower Bandelier)--1.45 Ma
Tsankawi (Upper Bandelier)--1.15 Ma
Long Valley caldera (Sierra Nevada Mountains. eastern California)
Bishop--0.75 Ma
This paper discusses the revised correlation of Pleistocene volcanic ash in the
middle reaches of the Arkansas River basin, differences between the revised and
the original correlation, and some possible reasons for the changes in
correlation.
Materials and Methods
Pleistocene volcanic ash from 32 locations in the middle reaches of the
Arkansas River basin were examined (see Fig. 1 in the other paper for Stops 1
and 2 in this guidebook for locations). The beds of Tertiary ash (Ashes 22, 24,
and 35) are not included in the revised correlation because shards from these

beds were not included in the INAA. Twenty-six of the Pleistocene ashes were
correlated with source eruptions. Other deposits of Pleistocene ash are not
definitely correlated with a source (Ward et aI., 1993; Fig.1).
Fine-sand-size shards of glass from a fraction purified by heavy-liquid
separation were analyzed by INAA. Thirty-three elements (iron (Fe), calcium
(Ca), sodium (Na), Potassium (K), zinc (Zn), zirconium (Zr), rubidium (Rb),
thorium (Th), manganese (Mn), cesium (Cs), barium (Ba), uranium (U),
lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu),
gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), holmium (Ho), ytterbium (Yb), ludesium (Lu),
hafnium (Hf), tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), scandium (Sc), chromium (Cr), cobalt
(Co), nickel (Ni), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and gold (Au» from the periodic
table were tested for using INAA. INAA analyses were performed by U.S.
Geological Survey personnel in Denver, Colorado (D. Sawyer, 1999, personal
communication). A few elements were determined by INAA and ICP or XRF.
A cluster analysis different from the original cluster published in Ward et aI.,
(1993), from which the revised correlation was made, included INAA, ICP, age,
and petrographic data. Data from the XRF are incomplete (not available for
some of the ash) and this resulted in the loss of some elements (niobium (Nb),
yttrium (Y), strontium (Sr), and lead (Pb» included in the original cluster analysis
Data for Ca, Fe, Na, and K were used from the INAA instead of the ICP because
of some possible erroneous values in the ICP data (possibly other minerals
besides glass in the fraction analyzed). Titanium (Ti) values from the ICP were
included with the cluster data. Elements from the INAA not included in the
revised cluster because of concentrations below detection limits were Cr, Ni, and
Au. The revised cluster analysis did not include W because mineral impurities
were removed with sodium polytungstate. Chemical data included in the cluster
analysis was ratios of each element with every other element (no reciprocals).
The revised cluster includes nearly 600 variables and the original cluster had 82
variables.
Results
INAA data included in the revised cluster analysis is given in Table 1. The
revised correlation and the dendrogram produced by the revised cluster analysis
are in Fig. 2.
Discussion
Ash previously not correlated with a source eruption is now correlated. Ashes
20,28,29 are Lava Creek B ash, Ash 33 is Bishop ash, and Ashes 4 and 16 are
Tsankawi ashes (Fig. 2). In the original correlation, Ashes 14 and 15 were
Tsankawi ash (Fig. 1). In the revised correlation, Ashes 14 and 15 are Mesa
Falls ash. Ash 2 correlated as a Mesa Falls ash in the original cluster and as a
Tsankawi ash in the revised cluster. Ash 7 correlated as a Tsankawi ash and
Ash 17 as a Lava Creek B ash in the original cluster. Ashes 7 and 17 group
together in the revised cluster and are not correlated with a known source.

The most confusing of the changes in correlation are those for Ashes 7, 16,
and 17. The glass shard fission-track age of Ash 16 is Lava Creek B ash but the
chemistry of the glass is similar to the Tsankawi ash. Other potential sources are
the Green Mountain Reservoir ash From the Long Valley caldera, younger
eruptions of the Jemez Mts., and the San Francisco Peaks area of northeast
Arizona.
Chemical make-up of Pleistocene volcanic ashes from major eruptions in the
western U.S. is similar for many elements. Guaje ash can be identified using by
several different elements (Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Cs, Co, Ta, Sc, Hf, Lu, Yb, Ho, Ce,
and La); Bishop ash can be identified with Sm, Ce, Ba, Gd, Sc, and As; and
Huckleberry Ridge ash is discerned with Sm, Ce, Ba, Gd, Sc, As, Ta, and Nd.
Ashes 7 and 17 differ from the rest of the ash in this study in concentrations of
As, Hf, Eu, Sm, Nd, and Cs. The Lava Creek B, Tsankawi, and Mesa Falls ash
are more difficult to discern. Analyses of source area material for these eruptions
indicate a wide range in composition of material from the eruptions.
The addition of the elements measured with INAA to the revised cluster
analysis increased the number of variables in the correlation 7-fold. The results
of the INAA analyses (the concentrations in the glass of a large number of
elements) and the subsequent revised cluster analysis using the INAA data
indicated a need for a revised correlation (Fig. 2) of the ash in the middle reaches
of the Arkansas River basin.

Abstract
Ages and elevations of ash layers correlated with late Tertiary' and Pleistocene eruptions in the western US and present
stream elevations are used to calculate net rates of incision by streams in the middle reaches of the Arkansas River basin in
the south central US. The mean of the 23 measurements of rate of stream incision in the study area is 4.2 ± 2.7 cmjky with
a range of 0.6 to 9.7 em/kyo Major influences on rate of stream incision in the study area include the arid to semi-arid
climate of the region. the type of material being incised by streams, stream captures, and salt dissolution in the bedrock that
underlies the region. Rates of incision exceeded rates of basin fi11ing but significant deposits of unconsolidated late Cenozoic
sediments occur in the study area. Basins of streams that have incised the slowest since the late Tertiary contain the thickest
and most extensive amounts of unconsolidated Quaternary sediments. Rates of incision by streams in the study area are
similar to or slower than rates reported for streams elsewhere in the US and the world. Streams in mountainous regions and

1. Introduction
The evolution of drainage basins is a primary
consideration in the management of natural resources. Areas susceptible (0 frequent flooding or

land-use decisions (i.e., placement of nuclear or hazardous wastes into repositories that are not going to
be incised by streams). Comparisons of long-term
rates of incision by streams from different areas are
used to select the best locations for critical structures, such as power plants. transportation networks,
and waste repositories. Long-term rates of incision
by streams are also indications of the present and
past climates affecting an area, landscape stability
within an area, and the amount of water that has
been transported by streams through an area. Unfortunately. materials that provide a numerical basis for

late Tertiary and Quaternary eruptions fanned
nearly-pure deposits (Boellstorff, 1976; Ward et a!.,
1993). Numerous layers of ash, correlated with eruptions that occurred at known times in the geologic
past, are identified in sediments of western North
America (Izett and Wilcox, 1982; Wilcox and Naeser,
1992; Table 1). Ash has been transported far
(hundreds to thousands of kilometers) from source
volcanoes before deposition (Ward et a!., 1993). Ash
far from a source is correlated to a source by comparisons with ash or rock at or near potential sources
(Izett, 1981). Radiometric (numericaI) age of the ash,
physical appearance and chemical composition of the
glass shards in an ash, and the kinds and characteristics of microphenocrysts (glass-mantled minerals
fanned in the magma before an eruption) in an ash
have been used to correlate ash with a specific
eruption (Izett et a!., 1972; Boellstorff, 1976; Izett,
1981).

3. Description of the study area
The Arkansas River flows - 1600 km (straight
line distance) from headwaters in the Southern Rocky
Mountains to where the river joins the Mississippi
River at the Arkansas-Mississippi state line and is

the primary drainageway for a large section of the
south central US (Fig. 1). The river crosses part of
the Southern Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, Central
Lowlands, Interior Highlands, and Mississippi River
Valley section of the Coastal Plain physiographic
provinces. Precambrian to upper Cenozoic rocks and
sediments are exposed in the Arkansas River basin.
The study area for this paper is the middle part of
the Arkansas River basin (Fig. I (inset) and Fig. 2).
This - 110,000 km' area is the south side of the
Arkansas River basin between 10 I' and 96'W longitude and includes parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, and
Texas (Fig. 2). Elevation in the study area ranges
from 840 m in the northwest corner to 120 m in the
southeast corner. The Salt Fork of the Arkansas,
Cimarron, North Canadian (Beaver), and Canadian
Rivers divide the middle part of the Arkansas River
basin into large sub-basins (Fig. 2 and Table 2). The
average gradients across the study area for the
Arkansas River and its major tributaries are given in
Table 2.
Three general physiographic regions occur in the
middle reaches of the Arkansas River basin: the
upper plains, the lower plains, and the escarpment
region between the upper and lower plains (Fig. 2).
The upper plains are part of the High Plains section
of the Great Plains and the Great Bend Lowland
(Fig. 2) and have a nearly continuous cover of

eolian, alluvial, lacustrine, and/or colluvial rock and
sediment (Frye and Leonard, 1952; Holliday, 1989).
Tertiary Ogallala Group sediments are the major
portion of the cover over the upper plains. The
northern part of the upper plains (Fig. 2), including
the Great Bend Lowland, is composed of material
eroded from Ogallala sediments to the west and
deposited by the Arkansas and Smoky Hill Rivers
during the Quaternary (Frye and Leonard, 1952;

Weeks and Gutentag, 1988). The Quaternary sediments of the northern part of the upper plains are
considered to be part of the regionally significant,
unconfined Ogallala aquifer of the central US (Weeks
and Gutentag, 1988). Sediments of the northern part
of the upper plains are included in the Crooked
Creek, Kingsdown, and Vanhem Formations
(ascending; Wayne and Aber, 199]). In the western
part of the upper plains (Fig. 2), the Tertiary Ogal-

lala Group is covered by the Blackwater Draw Formation, a sequence of paleosols formed in eolian
sediments during the early and middle Pleistocene
(Holliday, 1989). The primary source of the sediments of the Blackwater Draw Formation was eolian
deflation of floodplain deposits of the Pecos River to
the southwest (Holliday, 1989). Bedrock units that
underlie Ogallala Group sediments of the upper plains
include: the Cretaceous Kiowa Shale, the Triassic
Dockum Group, and the Permian Quartermaster Formation, Artesia Group (Tansil, Yates, Seven Rivers,
Queen, and Grayburg Formations), Cloud Chief Formation, Rush Springs Formation, Marlow Formation,
Dog Creek Shale and Yelton Salts, Blaine Formation, Flowerpot Shale and Salts, Clear Fork Group
(Hennessey Shale, Upper Clear Fork Salt, Upper
Cimarron Salt, Cimarron Anhydrite, Tubb Sands,
Tubb Zone, Lower Cimarron Salts, Hennessey Shale),
Panhandle Lime, Hutchison Salt and Wellington Formation (descending; Fay, 1965; Gustavson et a!.,
1980). The lower plains are part of the Central
Lowlands physiographic province (Fig. 2). The
drainage pattern in the lower plains is controlled by
the bedrock of the area (Madole, 1991a) and the
divides between the major streams of the lower
plains are bedrock escarpments (Fay, 1959). A significant amount of unconsolidated Quaternary sedi-

ment exists in the lower plains (Carter et a!., 1990),
but the deposits are not recognized as part of any
previously named geologic formations. Sequences of
terraces have been mapped in the basins of the major
rivers draining through the lower plains (Fay, 1959,
1965) and the terraces are confined to the areas
between the bedrock divides of the lower plains.

Channel deposits cap some drainage divides in the
lower plains (Carter et a!., 1990; Madole, 1991 a) and
the alluvium of the lower plains contains sediment
eroded from the local bedrock and the rocks and
sediment of the upper plains. Bedrock units that
underlie the upper plains (primarily units between
the Dockum Group and the Clear Fork Group) form
and cap the hills of the lower plains. The bedrock
units above the lower part of the Hennessey Shale of
the Clear Fork Group in the western part of the
lower plains do not occur in the central portion of
the lower plains and the Hennessey and Wellington
Formations are the surficial bedrock units in the
central part of the lower plains (Miser, 1954). Pennsylvanian rocks control the drainage and form the
hills in the eastern part of the lower plains (Miser,
1954; Ries, 1954). Bedrock units of the eastern
lower plains include: the Pennsylvanian Senora Formation, Calvin Sandstone, Wetumka Shale, Wewoka
Formation, Holdenville Formation, Seminole Formation, Checkerboard Limestone, Coffeyville Formation, Hogshooter Formation, Nellie Bly Formation,
Dewey Formation, Chanute Formation, Barnsdall
Formation, Tallant Formation, Vamoosa Formation,
Pawhuska Formation, Ada Formation, and Vanoss
Formation (ascending; Ries, 1954; Miser, 1954). Extensive dune fields line thc northeast sides of the
major rivers in the lower plains and the terraces of
the lower plains have been modified by eolian processes (Carter.et a!., 1990). The surface of the upper
plains is - 150 to more than 300 m higher than the
surface of the lower plains and stratigraphic sections
exposed in the escarpment region show the Tertiary
and Quaternary sediments of the upper plains overly-

ing bedrock units that form hills in the lower plains.
Erosion-resistant layers in the bedrock units beneath
the upper plains (Dockum Group through Clear Fork
Group) maintain the escarpment region between the
upper and lower plains.

area, and (2) the faster rate of uplift for the mountains compared to the rate of uplift of the plains
provided the streams with the energy needed to
erode and incise the plains (Gutentag et al., 1984).
This combination of differential uplift and aridity
resulted in a Quaternary history for the middle part
of the Arkansas River basin of large braided streams,
terrace formation, channel changes, and windblown
sediment (Gutentag et a!., 1984). Drainage development in the study area has also been affected by
dissolution of salt layers within the bedrock (Fay,
1965; Gustavson et a!., 1980; Gustavson and Finley,
1985). Salt dissolution and associated collapse features have been identified in parts of the study area
underlain by rocks of the Seven Rivers Formation,
San Andres Formation, Dog Creek Salts, Blaine
Formation, Flowerpot Salts, Clear Fork Group, and
Hutchison Salt (Gustavson et a!., 1980).

4, Drainage changes in the study area during the
Pleistocene
The history of Pleistocene drainage in the middle
part of the Arkansas River basin is complex. Significant changes have occurred in the courses of major
streams of the area during the Pleistocene. Underfit
streams flow in the abandoned channels of larger
streams (Fay, 1959, 1965) and fingers of stream
channel alluvium occur along drainage divides for

extended distances (Fay, 1959; Myers, 1962). The
present drainage system of the study area has existed
since pre-Wisconsinan or early Wisconsinan time
(Frye and Leonard, 1952; Fay, 1959, 1965; Myers,
1962; Brown, 1967).
The Arkansas River flowed southeast from the
western end of the Great Bend of the Arkansas River
(Figs. 2 and 3) to meet the former channel of the
Smoky Hill River in north-central Oklahoma (Fig. 3)
until pre-Wisconsinan or early Wisconsinan time,
The Smoky Hill River was the main drainageway for
west-central and central Kansas for much of the
Pleistocene (Frye and Leonard, 1952) until it was
diverted to the Kansas River basin when the 'MacPherson paleovalley' was filled with sediment late in
the Pleistocene (Frye and Leonard, 1952; Fig. 3).
The Great Bend of the Arkansas River was created
where a former tributary of the Smoky Hill River
di verted the Arkansas Ri ver to the former channel of
the Smoky Hill River south of the 'MacPherson
paleovalley' (Fig. 3) after the paleovalley was filled.
The Medicine Lodge and Salt Fork of the Arkansas
Rivers have occupied the former Arkansas River
channel since the Arkansas River was diverted into
the Great Bend late in the Pleistocene (Fig. 3).
The Salt Fork of the Arkansas River was previously a tributary of the Cimarron River (Fay, 1965;
Fig. 3). A tributary of the Arkansas River, before the
Arkansas River was diverted to the Great Bend,
captured the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River and

made the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River a tributary
of the Arkansas River (Fig. 3). The Salt Fork of the
Arkansas River is now an underfit stream flowing in
a former channel of the Arkansas River (Fig. 4).
Little Eagle Chief Creek flows in the former channel
of the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River between
where the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River was
captured and where the Salt Fork of the Arkansas
River previously joined the Cimarron River (Fay,
1965; Fig. 3).
The 'Scott-Finney' depression (Fig. 3) was an
important part of the drainage system of the middle

part of the Arkansas River basin in the early to
middle Pleistocene (Frye and Leonard, 1952).
Streams in southwestern and west central Kansas
flowed south through the depression into Oklahoma
(Frye and Leonard, 1952). The ancestral Cimarron
and North Canadian (Beaver) Rivers and ancestral
Crooked Creek converged at the southern end of the
depression (Fig. 3) and the stream formed at the
convergence was a major drainageway for western
Oklahoma (Myers, 1962). The channel of the como'
bined streams was near the present drainage divide
of the North Canadian (Beaver) and Cimarron Rivers

(Fig. 3). Sometime after the volcanic eruption in the
Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field that was responsible for the Lava Creek B ash (Table Il. head ward
erosion from the east by a stream that became the
eastern segment of the present-day Cimarron River

captured most of the combined North Canadian
(Beaverl-ancestral Cimarron stream (Fig. 3). The
capturing stream and the captured portion of the
combined North Canadian (Beaver)-ancestral
Cimarron River form the present Cimarron River
which flows northeast from the point of capture. A
line of siltstone hills is split by the Cimarron River at
the point of capture. Several large. closed depressions (Five Mile Creek and Big Basin (Fig. 3) also
exist in the area where the capture occurred. Dissolution of salt beds in the bedrock below the area could
have been a major cause of the capture. The capture
left the North Canadian (Beaver) River as a severely
underfit stream and it remains that way today.
The Canadian River flowed in the present Deer
Creek valley until some time after deposition of the

Lava Creek B ash (Fay. 1959; Dolliver, 1984; Fig.
3). Headward erosion by a downstream tributary of
the Canadian River pirated the Canadian River from
its former channel (Fig. 3). The 'Gerty Sands' are a
line of channel deposits along the southern drainage
divide of the Canadian River (Fig. 3). Fay (J 959)
believed these deposits were the remains of a pirated

Canadian River channel and possibly related to the
capture of the Canadian River in the Deer Creek
area.

the Public Land Survey System (Township and
Range; Table 3). The ash layers are interbedded with
late Tertiary to mid-Pleistocene sediments beneath
terraces that were created by streams of the study
area as they migrated and incised from drainage
divides to present locations (Figs. 6 and 7; Carter et
al" 1990). Ash directly overlies a variety of types of
sediment ranging from organic-rich clay to gravels
(Table 4). Ash of the study area is underlain by
channel and floodplain-type sediments (finely-stratified gravels, sands, and clays with little or no soil
development; ash nos. 1,7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15,21,
31, 34; Table 4), wetland-type sediments (gleyed
clays; ash nos. 2, 3, 5, 18, 23, 30, 32; Table 4), and
sediments modified by soil-forming processes (mottled or oxidized sands, silts, and clays; ash nos. 6, 9,
II, 19,25; Table 4). The types of sediments that are
described beneath the ash of the study area also
occur above the ash with the exception that the
wetland-type sediments described below the ash are

replaced by windblown silts and sands that have
been modified by soil-forming processes (Table 4).

layers are given in Table 4. Present-day gradients of
the streams that deposited the ashes, along the
stretches of the streams where ashes were deposited,
range from 0.4 mjkm to 2.5 mjkm (Table 5). The
local relief in these areas ranges from I m to 50 m
(Table 5).

6, Ash correlation and measurement of stream

incision

Net rates of stream incision in the middle part of
the Arkansas River basin were calculated using the
ages and elevations of ash deposits and the present
elevations of streams that deposited the ash. The
ashes used in this study, except for Ash no. 14 (Fig.
5), have been previously identified (Frye et aI., 1948;

Sampled ash deposits range in thickness from < 1 m
to > 30 m. Glass shards extracted from the ash
samples were dated by the uranium fission-track
method (Boellstorff, 1976; Ward et aI., 1993). Chemical composition (major, minor, and trace elements
by inductively-coupled argon spectrophotometry and
X-ray fluorescence techniques) and physical characteristics (shard morphology and index of refraction
using a petrographic microscope) of the glass shards
were used to characterize the ash layers (Ward et aI.,
1993). Ash deposits were correlated with late Tertiary and Pleistocene eruptions in the western US
(Table J) by statistical analyses of the physical and
chemical characteristics and fission-track age of the
glass shards in the ash and comparisons with data
reported for volcanic material near source volcanoes

(Ward et aI., 1993). The characteristics of the glass
shards of the ashes were important in correlating ash
to a specific eruption, as determined by discriminant

function analysis (Ward et aI., 1993; Table 6). The
ages of the eruptions (Table J), not the measured
glass shard fission-track ages of the ashes (Table 6),
were used to measure net rates of stream incision.

Elevations of ash deposits and stream channels
were determined from topographic profiles (Figs. 4,
6 and 7, for example) constructed using U.S. Geological Survey 7.S-minute topographic maps. The
topographic maps have lO-ft (3.0 m) or 20-ft (6.1 m)
contour intervals. The topographic profiles are
aligned perpendicular to the general direction of
present-day streamflow. Aerial photos, topographic
maps, U.S. Department of Agriculture/Soil Conservation Service county soil surveys, and field investigations were used to accurately locate the ash deposits and identify the streams that deposited the ash.
The evidence that the ash layers are alluvial deposits includes the fining-upward particle-size distribution and convoluting stratification of the ash beds,
presence of gravel layers above and below the ash in

lentils is similar to stratification found in recently

locations in the middle reaches of the Arkansas
River basin (Fig. 5). Measured rates of incision and
corresponding elevation data are given in Table 7.
Fourteen of the ashes were deposited by the Arkansas

deposited, sandy, floodplain deposits of the study
area. The locations of the ash lentils mark the approximate locations of the channels of the streams
that are measured for net rate of incision at the time
of the respective eruptions.
Net rates of stream incision were calculated using

the equation:
NRSI
(Volcanic ash elevation - stream channel elevation) X 0.1
Age of volcanic ash

( I)
where NRSI equals the net rate of stream incision in
centimeters per thousand years (cm/ky), elevations
are reported in meters, and age is in years. Rates of
stream incision from other parts of the US and the
world were obtained by a search of published geologic and geographic literature.

Net rate of stream incision was measured at 23

River or one of its large tributaries and nine ashes

were deposited by smaller tributary streams (Table
8). The five smaller tributary streams for which net
rate of incision was measured are the South Fork of
the Ninnescah River, Bluff Creek, and Crooked Creek
in southcentral Kansas, and Wolf Creek and Kiowa
Creek in northwest Oklahoma (Fig. 5). Measurement
of stream incision was made for nine locations in the
upper plains and escarpment parts of the study area,
and five locations in the lower plains (Table 9). Net
rate of stream incision was measured at seven loca-

tions in the Arkansas River basin (proper), one location in the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River basin,
four locations in the Cimarron River basin, seven

locations in the North Canadian (Beaver) River basin,

and three localions in the Canadian River basin
(Table 10).
The net rates of stream incision are an estimate of
the average rate of incision for the given time peri-

ods. Stream incision in the study area during the last
2 million years was probably affected by changes in
climate, vegetation, and local relief. The previously
mentioned stream piracies and drainage modifica-

sediment is identified in the Ogallala Group (Gustavson, 1996), the Blackwater Draw Formation (Holliday, 1989) and as sand dune belts in western and
central Oklahoma (Miser, 1954). The influx of windblown sediment into the channels of streams occa-

the study area. The actual rate of incision at any
given time in the past at any particular location could
have been absent, slow, moderate, rapid, or negative
(which would indicate aggradation was occurring).
Schmoker (J 986) estimated uplift associated with
removal of sediment in western Oklahoma to have
been 0.5 to 1.8 cmjky over the last 65 million years
and Hallam (J 963 and King (J 965) describe warping
(non-uniform uplift) of the North American continental interior that possibly affected rates of stream

The fastest net rate of incision (9.7 cmjky; Table
3) was measured for the Salt Fork of the Arkansas
River at Ash no. 31 and the Canadian River at Ash
no. 13. This incision rate was measured near a point

of capture of each stream. The capture events may
have increased the gradient of the stream or diverted
the stream to a more deeply-incised channel causing
the net rates of incision at these locations to be

greater than the rates at the other locations. The
bedrock at these locations includes layers of shale

that are nearly impermeable to water and susceptible
to incision.
The slowest net rate of incision (0.6 cm/ky;
Table 7) was measured for the Arkansas River at
Ash no. 8. The Arkansas River is flowing in the
former Smoky Hill River channel in this area (Fig. 3)
and the measured incision rate represents incision by
both the Smoky Hill and Arkansas Rivers since
deposition of the Bishop Ash (- 0.75 m.a.). The
diversion of the Arkansas River to the former Smoky
Hill River channel probably included a large influx
of sediment. The net rate of incision is slow because
the diversion of the Arkansas River around the Great
Bend occurred only 20 to 40 ka and the Arkansas
River has had this relatively short amount of time to
incise the sediment accompanying the diversion of

the river. The drainage basin upstream from this
location is arid and the discharge of the s.tream in
this area does not create a large amount of streampower.
Net rates of stream incision at volcanic ash localities in the middle part of the Arkansas River are
summarized in Table 11. The mean of the 23 measurements of stream incision in the study area is
4.2 ± 2.7 (J standard deviation) cm/ky. The fastest
mean net rates of stream incision in the study area
are for the main streams (4.9 ± 3.0 cm/ky), streams
in the lower plains (5.6 ± 2.6 cm/ky), and streams
in the Canadian River sub-basin (8.6 ± 0.8 cm/ky)
and the slowest mean net rates of stream incision in
the study area are for the tributary streams (3.0 ± 1.7
cm/ky), streams in the upper plains (3.0 ± 2.2

greater stream power because they generally contain
more stream flow than tributary streams (Table 12).
The amount of unconsolidated Quaternary sediment in the different parts of the study area may be
related to the differences in mean net rates of incision between the general physiographic regions and
the major sub-basins of the study area. The areas

8. Stream incision rates from other areas
Reported rates of stream incision from other areas

in the US and the world are given in Table 13. The

slowest mean net rates of stream incision and the

slowest rate is for streams in southeast Australia

areas with the least amount of Quaternary sediment
(the lower plains and the Canadian River sub-basin)

(Bishop, 1985) and the fastest rate is for streams in
the mountains of Poland (Froehlich et aI., 1977).
Froehlich et aI., 1977 believed that a large anthropogenic factor influenced the rate of incision by the
streams in the Carpathian Mountains of Poland. Rates
of incision by streams in the middle part of the
Arkansas River basin are similar to many of the
reported rates from other areas (Australia and the
Great Plains of the US; Stewart, 1973; Young, 1983;
Bishop, 1985; Colton et aI., 1986; Stephenson and
Coventry, 1986; Mears, 1991; Madole, 1991b; Reheis, 1992; Pierce and Morgan, 1992; Table 13).
Streams in areas affected by rapid uplift (New
Zealand, European mountain ranges; Knuepfer, 1985;
Bull and Knuepfer, 1987; Table 3) and extensive
faulting (S. California, New Zealand; Rockwell et
aI., 1984; Table 13) have incised at faster rates than

have the fastest mean net rates of stream incision.

The streams in the basins with the slowest rates of
incision lacked the stream power to carry entrained

sediment through the study area and this resulted in
deposition of significant amounts of sediment (a tendency toward net aggradation). The permeable, unconsolidated sediments may have also slowed incision by sustaining vegetation and protecting areas

from erosion for longer periods of time than exposed
bedrock. The capture of the ancestral North Canadian {Beaver)-Cimarron stream made the North
Canadian (Beaver) River a severely underfit stream
in a basin that contains a large amount of unconsoli-

dated Quaternary sediment. The slow net rates of
incision by the North Canadian (Beaver) River at
Ash nos. 30 and 32 (Fig. 5 and Table 7) are a
reflection of the loss of stream power by North
Canadian (Beaver) River. The 600-ky ashes are about
a kilometer from the river (Fig. 6) at these locations

streams in the study area. Measurements of basin

denudation, fossils, soil development, and a variety
of radiometric techniques have been used as a basis

to measure rates of stream incision (Table 13).

9. Summary
The net positive values for rate of incision by
streams in the upper plains. escarpment region, and
lower plains of the study area indicate that since the

late Tertiary incision by streams has exceeded processes responsible for basin filling. The measured
rates of incision for streams in the middle reaches of
the Arkansas River basin range from 0.6 to 9.7
cmjky and the mean of the 23 measurements of net

rate of incision is 4.2 ± 2.7 cm/ky. Although the net
rates of incision are positive, the Quaternary history
of the study area includes long periods of time when
streams were depositing sediment and fanning terraces (Figs. 4, 6 and 7). Rates of incision in the
study area were influenced by the types of material
being incised by streams, stream capture events,
dissolution of salt in the underlying bedrock, and the
amount of water carried by the streams. The results
of the study indicate that the main streams of the
study area have incised at a faster net rate than the
tributary streams. These results are somewhat skewed
because rate of incision was not measured for any
tributary streams in the lower plains and the streams
that are the main drainageways for the lower plains
had the fastest net rates of incision.
The factor that is most influential on the net rate
of incision by streams of the study area is the aridity
of the climate. The rain shadow created by uplift of
the Southern Rocky Mountains affected the geomorphic development of the middle reaches of the
Arkansas River basin. The small amounts of rainfall
in the study area limit the ability of the streams of
the area to incise and transport sediment. The lack of
stream power in the study area is expressed in three
ways: (I) slow net rates of incision by streams, (2)
an abundance of unconsolidated Quaternary deposits
formed from material eroded either upstream from
the study area, from within the study area, or both,
and (3) basins of streams that have incised the
slowest since the late Tertiary contain the most
unconsolidated Quaternary sediment.

Deposits of volcanic ash from major er'uptions during the latc Tertiary and early·to-middle Pleistocene in the western U.S. are interbedded with
unconsolidated sediments in parts of Oklahoma. Kansas. and Texas. Soils and sediments at the land surface at the time of the eruptions were buried
by the relatively pure (> 95% glass shards) ash. The former surface soils. or paleosols. contain information about soil·forming processes. climates.
and landscapes of the region prior to and at the time of the eruptions. Field descriptions of the paleosols are made using pedologic nomenclature.
Comparisons are made of paleosols buried by deposits of ash from the same eruption. paleosols buried by deposits of ash from eruptions of

Ash from eruptions occurring hundreds of thousands to more than a million years apart buried paleosols which have common chanlcteristics.

pure ash were deposited a short time (days or weeks)
after the ash was dropped on the land surface. The age
of the ash indicates the approximate time of burial of
the soils and sediments beneath the ash. Characteristics
of the paleosols buried by ash preserve information
about the land surface and the type of environment at
the time of the eruptions. A paleo pedologic approach
can be used to obtain environmental information from
the paleosols.
Retallack (1990) defines paleopedology as, ' ... the
study of ancient soils'. and describes ancient soils as,
, ... soils of the past, either buried within sedimentary
sequences or persisting under changed surface conditions'. Ruhe (1965) defines paleopedology as. ' ... the
study of paleosols', and a paleosol as, ' ... a soil that
formed on a landscape of the past'. Ruhe (1965) includes buried soil as a type of soil which can be studied
using paleo pedologic techniques. Nikiforoff (1943) recognizes fossil-buried soils (paleosols) as providing information about past landscapes. Comparing soils
from landscapes of today with soils from landscapes of
the past provides insight on the evolution of landscapes
and IS pertinent to pedologists. climatologists, paleontologists. ecologists and geographers (Nikiforoff, 1943).
The relative amounts of addition. loss. translocation
and transformation of material in a soil profile control
the degree of soil horizon differentiation (Simonson,
1978). Processes which enrich a soil profile (i.e. incorporation of organic matter. iIIuviation of clay) and processes which degrade a soil profile (i.e. erosion) operate
simultaneously to influence soil morphology (Johnson
and Watson-Slegner, 1987).
Soils form as landscapes develop and vice versa (Hall.
1983; Olson. 1989). Hall (1983) describes the direct
relationship between soil and landscape development

INTRODUCTION
Pleistocene Volcanie Eruptions and Associated Deposits

Several times between the late Tertiary and middle
Pleistocene (2.1-0.6 mal, immense volcanic eruptions in
the western United States spewed hundreds to thousands ofkm 3 of volcanic ash into the atmosphere (lzett,
1981; Sarna-Wojcicki and Davis, 1991: Table 1). Highlevel winds carried ash hundreds to thousands of km
from its source (Izett and Wilcox, 1982). Ash was
deposited as a blanket on the land surface and
subsequently concentrated by water and wind into
discernible volcanic ash layers. or mixed ash and nonash layers of varying concentrations (Reynolds, 1982:
Powers and Malde, 1961; Ward et al., 1993). Relatively
pure (> 95% glass shards), distal airfall ash deposits
and subsequent concentrations of volcanic ash. meters
to tens of meters thick, have been recognized in the U.S.
at many localities west of the Mississippi River (Frye
et al.. 1948; Boellstorff, 1976; Izett and Wilcox, 1982;
Ward et al., 1993). Distal airfall ash layers have been
correlated with source volcanoes by ·comparing
radiometric ages. physical characteristics (glass shard
morphology and index of refraction). chemical characteristics (major. minor. and trace element concentrations of glass shards), and petrographic characteristics
of microphenocrysts (glass-mantled primary minerals
formed in the magma before the eruption) (fzett. 1981;
Sarna-Wojcicki and Davis. 1991; Ward et al.. 1993).

with. . ... There is no clear boundary between the
processes in geomorphology and those in pedology.
Therefore. interdisciplinary studies are required in order to explain many geomorphic and pedologic features'. Interpreting the soil-forming processes of buried
soils can be difficult. Characteristic features of buried
soils could be the result of pedologic. sedimentologic.
and/or diagenetic processes (Valentine and Dalrymple.
1976: Birkeland. 1984: Frye. 1949: Simonson. 1954).
Identification of original surface horizons of a buried
soil is critical to determining whether the soil was
in an erosional. constructional. or stable landscape
position when at the surface (Follmer, 1982). Paleosols.
based on soil morphology. should be recognized as
parts of paleocatenas ('a chain' of soils associated
and occurring on a former landscape) for best interpretations (Conacher and Dalrymple, 1977: Olson,
1989).
Soil properties used in interpretations of buried soils
include profile depth. color. thickness of horizons, sequence of horizons. morphology of calcic horizons,
parti'cle size changes. and nature and kinds of precipitates (Bryan and Albritton, 1943: Frye. 1949:
Simonson. 1954: Ruhe. 1970: Olson. 1989). Soil features
considered persistent after burial include argillic horizons. spodic horizons. cemented horizons and soil
structure (Simonson, 1954: Retallack. 1990). Mack er a/.
(1993) have created a systemic classification system for
paleosols based on field characteristics. Important features of the system include degrees of melanization.
horizon differentiation and illuviation of weathering
products.

RdarioJ1Sltips of Aslt alld Paleosols
Deposits of volcanic ash are well known at many
localities in the western U.S. (lzett er al.. 1970: 1972:
lzen. 1981: Sarna-Wojcicki er al.. 1985: Ward er ai..
19931. !zett er al. (1970) identify several deposits of
Bishop and Lava Creek B ash in the western U.S. by
extensive characterization procedures. Holiday and
Gusta vson (1991) and Carter er al. (19901 recognize
Pleistocene-age ash in terrace sediments. Cornwell and

Malde (19611. Westgate el al. (19871 and Davis (1983)
identify ash overlying lacustrine sediment. and
Boellstorff (19781. Hallberg (1986). Westgate er al.
(19871. and Frye et al. (19481 identify ash above glacial
sediment. Deposits of Lava Creek B ash are found in
sediments from Louisiana to the Pacific Ocean to
Canada (lzett and Wilcox. 19821. Ash deposits of
Pleistocene-age serve to bracket formation ages in
south Texas and New Mexico (Hawley er al.. 1976;
Mack er al.. 1993).
Ash deposits are recognized overlying paleosols
(Hallberg. 1986: Richmond. 1986b. Holiday and
Gustavson. 1991). In some instances. where ash is identified overlying a paleosol. detailed descriptions of the
paleosol and interpretations of the genesis of the
paleosol are lacking and a relative term estimates the
degree of development of the paleosol (i.e .. weakly,
strongly. poorly or well developed) (Richmond. 1986b:
Eardley er al.. 19741.
Detailed descriptions and interpretations of soil
forming processes of paleosols buried by volcanic ash
have been done: Gile (1986) describes an eroded
paleosol formed in alluvial clay underlying a lens of
Lava Creek B ash. Zakrzewski (1988) describes a layer
of Huckleberry Ridge ash (- 2.0 mal overlying olivegray silt underlain by yellowish-green sand with abundant caliche nodules at one location and overlying
greenish-gray very fine sand underlain by greenishgray sandy silt interspersed with gravel at another
location. Holiday and Gustavson (1991) describe Guaje
ash overlying a paleosol with a petrocalcic horizon.
Deposits of Lava Creek Band Guaje ash bracket
a succession of buried soils (paleosols of the Blackwater
Draw Formation of the Texas High Plains) representing cycles of aridity and stability in the region between the early and middle Pleistocene (Holiday and
Gustavson, 19911.
The purpose of this paper is multi-faceted. Paleosols
buried by Pleistocene and Tertiary volcanic ash are
described and compared. Interpretations are made
concerning the environments of deposition (alluvial,
eolian. lacustrine. etc.1 of the ash and the soil-forming
processes at the time of ash deposition. Sites containing
ash of the same age provide information concerning
soil-landscapes of the region at a specific point in time.
Sites containing ash of different age contain evidence of
soil-landscape e\'Olution in the region through time.
Comparisons of ash-buried paleosols with modern
soils enable evaluation of past and present soil-forming
processes and factors of soil formation. especially
climate.

PRESENT LANDSCAPES AND CLIMATES
OF THE STUDY AREA
The study area is a large part of the southcentral
United States (Fig. I). The area is - 500.000 km' in size
including, (1) portions of the Arkansas. Canadian. and
Red Rivers, (2) part or all of the Ozark. Ouachita.
Arbuckle, and Wichita Mountain Ranges. and (3) the
eastern edge of the Southern High Plains surface
(a prominent escarpment).
Terraces of the larger streams are meters to tens of
meters above present stream levels and occasionally
more than 100m (Carter er al.. 1990). Larger terraces.
particularly, in the western part of the area, are tens of
km wide (Carter er al .. 1990). Terraces of the larger
streams are dissected and truncated by smaller streams
and their sediments. Alluvial sediments (sands and
gravels) are common on drainage divides between the
large rivers (Carter er al., 1990). Deposits of volcanic
ash are interbedded within the terrace alluvium> 10 m
above present streams and on drainage divides of the
larger streams (Carter er al., 1990; Madole el al., 1991).
Present soil moisture regimes range from aridic in
the northwest corner of the area to ustic in most of the
western part of the area to udic in the eastern part of
the area. Soil temperature regime is mostly thermic.

TYPES OF PALEOSOLS
Introduction

Field descriptions of paleosols buried by ash of known
age were made at 28 locations in the study area (Fig. I:
Table 2). Descriptions were made from exposures along
terrace escarpments. high walls exposed by mining. and
auger holes. Soil horizon characteristics described include depth. color, texture. structure (when possible),
consistence (when possible). horizon boundaries (when
possible). effervescence (reaction to a 10% solution of
hydrochloric acid), and special features such as mottling,
calcium carbonate nodules or concretions. Fe-Mn
nodules or concentrations and presence of and kinds of
gravels (Table 2). Structure. consistence, and horizon
boundaries were not described from auger borings.

Terliary Ash
The Tertiary ash (sites 22, 24, and 35) is 10, 6, and
9 million years old (Ward el al., 1993), respectively. The

paleosol at site 22 is clayey. has strong structure. thick.
continuous c1ayskins on ped surfaces. and prominent
mottling throughout. These features are typical of
modern soils in sinkholes. buffalo wallows. and playas
of the region. Paleosols at sites 24 and 35 are sandier
than at site 22. Translocation of clay. accumulation of
calcium carbonate. and mottles are evident in the
paleosol at site 24. Characteristics of the paleosols at
sites 24 and 35 are similar to modern soils formed from
alluvium.

Hllckleherrr Ridge Ash (-2.111/0)
The paleosols below Huckleberry Ridge ash (sites
5 and 19) are silty clay textured. prominently mottled
or strongly gleyed. and have accumulations of calcium carbonate. These are features of modern soils in
sinkholes. buffalo wallows. and playas. Structure is
stronger in the paleosol at site 5 compared to the
paleosol at site 19. The gleyed nature 15Y soil ~olors) of.
the paleosol at site 5 indicates that soil has been affected by water-saturated conditions for longer periods of
time than the paleosol at site 19.

Gaaie Ash (-1.5 mal
Guaje ash Isite 6) overlies a paleosol formed from
prominently mottled. loamy. non-calcareous sediments. Characteristics of the paleosol at site 6 are
similar to modern soils formed in high-terrace ( > 10 m
above present stream elevations) alluvium which have
been modified by soil-forming processes for significant
periods of time. Evidence of development include clay
translocation and nodules of Fe-Mn oxides.

Mesa Falls Ash (-1.25 ma)
Mesa Falls ash Isites 2. 25. 26) overlies a different
kind of paleosol at each site. The paleosol at site 2
formed from clayey. strongly gleyed. non-calcareous
sediment. The 'paleosol at site 25 formed from loamy.
calcareous sediment. The paleosol at site 26 formed
from sandy. non-calcareous sediment. The horizon directly below the ash at site 2 is organic-rich as indicated
by a dark (5Y3 2) moist soil color. Characteristics of
the paleosol at site 2 are similar to modern soils found
in depressions. At sites 25 and 26 ash was deposited
over alluvium. The paleosol at site 25 shows evidence of
development including clay translocation and calcium
carbonate accumulation. The sands and gravels at site
26 are stratified and massive.

Tsallkmri (Ash 1.15 mal
The paleosols at 4 Tsankawi ash sites (sites 7. 12. 14.
.1Ild 15) are similar. Paleosols formed from loamy.
sandy. or gravelly material which has been slightly
affected by soil-forming processes. The ash was depos-

ited in floodplain or low terrace ( < 10 m above present
stream elevations) locations at these sites. The paleosol
at site I I is well developed and formed in silty. calcareous alluvium. Clay has been translocated and
calcium carbonate .has accumulated in the paleosol at
site I I.

Bishop Ash (0.7511/0)
Bishop ash (sites 8 and 10) overlies sandy and loamy
sediments. The sediments below Bishop ash are stratified and massive. The paleosols at sites 8 and 10 are
similar to modern soils described in floodplain or
stream channel locations.

Lava Creek BAsh (- 0.6 ma)
Most of the paleosols buried by Lava Creek Bash
(sites I, 3, 9. 13. 17, 21, 23, 27, 30, 31. 32, and 34)
resemble modern soils found in depressions on the
landscape. The paleosols at sites 3,13,17,21,23,27,30,
and 32 formed from clayey, gleyed or prominently
mottled sediments. Translocation of clay and/or accumulation of calcium carbonate are visible in these
paleosols. The lower horizons of the paleosols at sites
13 and 21 are sandy. The paleosols at sites 1,31, and 34
are sandy and have been slightly affected by soil-forming processes. These soils are similar to modern soils in
floodplain or near stream channel locations. The
paleosol at site 9 is clayey, has moderate structure, clay
translocation. and calcium carbonate accumulation.
The well developed paleosol at site 9 formed from finetextured alluvium.

COMPARISONS OF SURFACE SOILS BURIED
BY VOLCANIC ASH: 2.l-0.6m.a.
The volcanic ash in this study buried four types of
soils or sediments: (l) Poorly drained, clayey soils modified by soil-forming processes for extended periods of
time; (2) Somewhat poorly to well-drained, loamy soils
modified by soil-forming processes for extended periods of time; (3) Well-drained, sandy and loamy soils
modified by soil-forming processes for short periods of
time; (4) Well-drained, stratified, massive, sandy and
gravelly material.
Well-developed soils in depressions (Type 1) were
buried 2.1, 1.25. and 0.6ma. Well-developed soils on
terraces (Type 2) were buried 1.5, 1.25, 1.1 5, and 0.6 mao
Weakly developed soils on terraces or floodplains
(Type 3) were buried 1.15 and 0.60ma. Floodplain
sediments (Type 4) were buried 1.25 and 0.75 mao
The well-developed soils in depressions buried 2.1
and 0.6 ma are similar. Clay translocation, calcium

formed on terraces (Type 2) were buried between 1.5
and 0.6 rna. Bishop ash is underlain by stratified, sandy
and gravelly sediment (Type 4) at sites less than 15 km
apart.
Volcanic ash was deposited and preserved in clayey,
depressional areas on the landscape from the late Tertiary to the middle Pleistocene. Deposits of ash were
preserved on stable terrace surfaces throughout the
early and middle Pleistocene. Tsankawi and Lava
Creek B ash buried soils on floodplains or low terraces
which had been affected by soil-forming processes long
enough to develop weak structures. Mesa Falls and
Bishop ash buried sandy and gravelly sediments on
floodplains which had not begun to show evidence of
soil formation.

Comparisons of past and present soils indicate landscapes and climates of the region today are similar to
landscapes and climates of the region at other times
during the Tertiary and Pleistocene. Soil properties
and processes (i.e. clay translocation, structure. calcium
carbonate accumulation, mottling. gravel content) are
similar in present-day soils and paleosols buried by
volcanic ash of Tertiary to middle Pleistocene age.
Deposits of volcanic ash were captured and preserved
in landscape positions similar to those of present-day
landscapes.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The landowners graciously gave us permission to use their prop-

erty. The soil sciemisls with the USDA-SCS offices produced the soil
surveys used to make comparisons. Debbie Porter. senior secretary

PAST AND PRESENT SOILS AND LANDSCAPES
OF THE REGION
Descriptions of the paleosols were compared to type
descriptions of present-day surface soils using USDASCS county soil surveys. Each soil was given a soil
series name based on comparisons (Table 3). Soil surveys from nearby counties were used to name paleosols
at sites 2, 13, and 22 because clayey, depressional soils
are not described at the present-day surface in the
counties where these sites are located. The same soil
series was used to name paleosols in five cases (sites'
8 and 10: sites 14 and 35: sites 15 and 21: sites 2, 22, and
23: sites 13 and 31) (Table 3).
Thirteen of the soil series are M ollisols, 3 are Entisols, 3 are Alfisols, 2 are Vertisols. and I is an Inceptisol (Table 3). Parent material of all the soil series
chosen is alluvium. The soil series are found in upland,
terrace and/or floodplain locations. The named soil
series range from strongly developed (Argiustolls) to
soils showing minimal development (Ustifluvents).
Soils similar to the paleosols occur at the land surface today. The range in paleosols is similar to the
range of soils at the present land surface. Welldeveloped soils cover the majority of the uplands and
high terraces. Degree of soil development is less in soils
on low terraces and floodplains compared to soils on
high terraces and uplands. Landscapes of the early to
middle Pleistocene were similar to landscapes of today
based on soil characteristics. The resemblance between
modern soils and ash-buried paleosols infers that the
present climate is similar to the climate of the region
when the eruptions occurred. Soils buried as much as
6 and 10 ma are similar to soils at the land surface
today.

SUMMARY
The paleosols buried by late Tertiary and Pleistocene-ash in the region resemble modern soils. Upland,
high terrace, low terrace. and floodplain soils are described beneath volcanic ash of the region.

STOP 3
Brief Overview:
Mounded Soil Landscapes in Oklahoma
by Brian J. Carter
Stop 3 on the field trip will examine a soil profile extending from a mounded soil to an
intermound soil. Stop 3 is located in the same study area referred to in Allgood and Gray (1973,
1974).
Allgood and Gray (1973 and 1974) explain the small mounds that occur in eastern
Oklahoma as created from the intense occupation of the soil A horizon by a complex association
of plants and animals escaping the seasonal (usually spring) wet soil conditions. They could not
explain the mounded soil as originating from the efforts of one particular organism. They did
not explain them as having a geologic or strictly physical mode offormation.
Several observations of my own and not rigorously supported by fact can be added to
Allgood and Gray (1973 and 1974): 1) mounded soils are found in forest environments as well
as grasslands, 2) mounded soils are similar in size and shape (there are not small ones which can
be interpreted as expanding into larger one, 3) mounded soils occur on soil parents materials of
residual shale and alluvium, 4) mounded soils occur on a variety oflandscape positions including
streams terraces, toeslopes, footslopes, backslopes, shoulder and summit but not on floodplains,
5) for Oklahoma the range in soil morphology across mounded and intermound soils has not
been widely reported, 6) mounded soils are disappearing due to cultivation and land smoothing none have been reported as being reformed after being destroyed.
Berg (1990) in the journal Geology pages 281 through 285 has proposed a "Formation of
Mima Mounds: A seismic hypothesis". In this article Berg (1990) proposes that the occurrence
of mounded soils can be attributed to earthquakes and soils with rigid subsoils and strata. Berg
(1990) explains the formation of the mounds as an interaction between vibrational waves and
unconsolidated sediments above a rigid surface. This hypothesis can be used to explain
mounded soil formation by a strictly physical mode.
Soil morphologic, chemical, and physical data easily distinguish mounded soils from
intermound soils in eastern Oklahoma (Allgood and Gray, 1973). The mounded soils have
thicker A horizons and contain relatively more organic matter. The thick A horizon is the major
reason for the appearance of the mounded compared to the intermound soil (with a thin A
horizon). Base saturation is slightly higher in the A horizon in the mound soil compared to the
intermound soil. Also, phosphorus content is greater in the A horizon of the mounded compared
to intermound soil. "The bulk density of the surface horizons of the mounded soils is
consistently less than that of the associated intermound" (Allgood and Gray, 1973). The larger
volumes of animal burrows (crotovinas or krotovinas), worm casts, and plant roots of the A
horizon of mound compared to intermound soils are used to explain the organic matter, base
saturation, phosphorous content, and bulk density measurements described above. To further
support this biological activity as a cause for mound preservation; soil boundaries are less
distinct in mounded soils compared to intermound soils. The lack of distinct boundaries and the

formation of a transition horizon (especially the E3) in the mound compared to the intermound
soil is caused by biological mixing of the upper soil solum (Allgood and Gray, 1974).
Excess soil water often surpresses aerobic biological activity including small mammal,
earthworm, insect, and root growth of many native grasses. Mounded soils are a haven for these
organisms to escape relatively wet intermound areas in eastern Oklahoma. Mottles
(redoximorphic features), gleying, and Fe-Mn concretions are soil characteristics which identify
an excess of soil water. Mounded soils have greater depth to mottles, gleying, and Fe-Mn
concretions compounded to intermound soils. Biological activity is therefore greater in the
"better-drained" mound soil compare to the "poorly-drained" intermound soil (Allgood and
Gray, 1993).
Although soil morphologic, chemical and physical data distinguish mound from
intermound soils and support the idea that biological activity is greater in the mound versus
intermound soil; the initial cause and mode of formation of mounded soil is still unclear after
reading (Allgood and Gray, 1973 and 1974).

Genesis, Morphology, and Classification of Mounded Soils in· Eastern Oklahoma'
F. P. ALLGOOD AND FENTON GRAY"

ABSTRACT

Mounded soiJs of Site 1 are classified as Aquic Paleudolls or
Aquic ArgiudoJJs in the present system of soil classification
(I2). But most of the mounded soils which were studied would
be better classified with a vermic modifier.

Numerous smaU mounds are unique features of landscapes
that extend from the southern part of Missouri to the coast of
Texas. Many hectares of eastern Oklahoma are inc1uded in this
vast area. The mounds occur in densities of 8 to 16/ha.
These mounds were studied with special emphasis on the
genesis, morphology, and c1assification of associated soil pedons.
Laboratory measurements inc1uded partic1e size distributions,
bulk density, extractable cations, and organic matter ex~
tractions.
Soil morphological features and laboratory analyses indicated
that the development of the mounded soils diHers from that of
the associated intermound pedons by being highly altered by
the many organisms of the landscape that assemble in the
selected elevated soil to escape seasonal wet soil conditions.

about 15 m in diameter and nearly 1 m in height and occupy a volume of 75 to 100 rna. Representative mounded

intermound soils and to classify these soils accurately by
a soil taxonomy system. The present mapping units of
mounded phases do not adequately describe these soils.
A companion paper will report the ecological relationships to the construction of these unique, small "verma"
mounds.
Special attributes of the mounded soils in eastern Oklahoma may accommodate more specialized cropping than
the associated intermound soils and should, therefore, be
correctly classified and mapped, thus, enhancing the interpretations for suitabilhy potentials for both agricultural and
engineering uses of these soils.

GEOGRAPHY OF THE STUDY AREAS
The field study of these unique mounds was conducted in
Muskogee and McIntosh Counties in Oklahoma (Fig. O. The
elevation is approximately 180 ms above sea level. A mound in
a 5.2 ha meadow in the southern part of Muskogee County was
used as the nucleus of the study and is referred to as Site I.
Relief-Common slopes associated with landscapes containing mounds range from nearly level to gently sloping. Only occasionally are landscapes with slopes greater than 5% found to
contain mounds.
The general slope associated with Site I is nearly level. Runoff is medium to slow with no discern able drainage pattern.
Geology-Rocks that lie below the regolith in the landscape
of Site I are of the Boggy unit of the Des Moines series of the
Pennsylvanian geological system. The Boggy formation aver"
ages about 150 m (500 feet) thick in the general area. It con·
sists of medium grained, tan to brownish sandstone. siltstone,
and gray to dark gray shale (I) (R. A. Meeks, 1957. The geol·
ogy of the Onapa-Counci! Hill area, Muskogee and McIntosh
Counties, Oklahoma. M.S. Thesis. Oklahoma University, Nor·
man) Everett R. Neff, 1961. Surface geology of Mclntosh
County, Oklahoma. M.S. Thesis. University of Oklahoma, Nor~
man.). Shale is encountered beneath the soil solum of Site 1.
Climate-A temperate, continental, moist, subhumid type of
climate prevails in the area where the mounded soils were stud·
ied (This is transitional to humid which prevails to the east.
Described by Stanley G. Holbrook, State Climatologist of US
Dep. of Commerce Weather Bureau in Okmulgee County, Soil
Survey, 1968). The mean annual precipitation is 105.51 Cm
with a mean annual temperature of 16.6C.
The mounds in Oklahoma are closely associated with the 102
em plus rainfall belt (Fig. 1). The soils of the intermound areas
of Site I are saturated with water during the spring of each year.

As indicated by the degree of soil mottlings, the mounded soils
are not commonly saturated in the upper fringes of the mollie
epipedon. The Thomthwaite annual P-E index is about 68 for
the location.
Plallts-Soils occurring in the study area developed under a
cover of herbaceous plants consisting mostly of tall grasses. The
small upland streams that form the drainage system of the upland prairies are generally surrounded by trees. Rough broken
areas that lie within 5 to 10 km are also forested with deciduous trees. Vegetation measurements were made of Site I whicb
showed a greater production of forage on the mounds than on
the intermound soils.
Time-The elapse of time pertaining to soil weathering in
the mound and intermound pedons is considered a constant factor. Knechtel (4) placed the age of the surface containing
mounds in the associated region to be no older than late Pleis·
tocene. However, enough time has evolved to permit the development of soils with strong horizonations. These well· developed
B2t horizons indicate that soil materials have been subjected to
leaching and weathering for a considerable length of time.

METHODS AND PROCEDURES
Mounds sampled were in an area extending between 10 and
40 km north of Eufaula in Muskogee and McIntosh Counties.
The area selected for the nucleus of the study was a mound in a
nearly level meadow containing 46 mounds (Site I) Fig.2).
This figure shows the elevation and location of the study mound
relative to other mounds in the field. A backhoe was employed
in making excavations in the mound and intermound. Zero
marked the intermound excavation with numbers one through
nine locating pedons in the mound (Fig. 5 shows reference
no. 0 through 5). Soil horizons were marked with string, and
crotovinas and rodent passageways were flagged for ease in
taking measurements. Bulk density samples Were taken in trip·
licate of all soil horizons of Pedons 0 and 3 in Site I and in nine
different mounds and associated intermounds of five different
landscapes.
Soil samples or chemical, mineralogical, and physical analysis were air-dried and processed to pass a 2-mm screen. Mechanical analyses were determined by procedures outlined by
Day (2). The pH of the soil was determined on a 1: 1 soil/
water paste and on a 1; 1 soil/KCL mixture using a corning pH
meter. Exchangeable sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were determined by leaching a soil sample with neutral
IN ammonium acetate. Sodium and potassium were deter·
mined with a Perkin· Elmer #303 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Calcium and magnesium were measured by the
EDTA Method (11).

Soil organic matter was detennined by the potassium dichromate wet combustion method (9). Exchangeable hydrogen was
determined by the barium chloridetriethanolamine method (6).
Total phosphorus measurements were made by digestion of the
soil with perchloric (72%) acid (10). The molybdemeous blue
color was developed by using the ascorbic acid reduction procedure. Bulk density samples were oven dried and bulk density
determinations were made in the laboratory (11).

is in the surface horizons (Fig. 3a and 3b). A second
prominent accumulation is in the upper part of the argillic
horizon of the intermound pedon. This iHuviated accumulation is an indication of transformation of organic matter
and transfer of humus along with illuviated clay to the
argillic horizon.
Accumulations of organic matter are increased in crotovinas because of the higher concentration of residue deposited as rodent bedding or from '''downwash'' material
from the surface. Crotovinas are numerous in the epipedons of the mounded soils but are absent from the argillic
horizon. Crotovinas are not present in the intermound
pedon of Site J.
The production per hectare of herbaceous material on
the mounds was 4,997 kg compared to 3,227 kg from the
associated intermound areas. This could imply that a
greater amount of organic residues may be returned to the
mounded soils. This source of organic matter coupled with
highly porous surface horizons and a humid warm climate
present conditions for a rapid mineralization of the organic matter. This along with high base saturation may account for the higher organic matter contents in the immediate surface of the intermound ped~n than the mounded
soil pedon. Also, the intermound soil may receive organic
matter in runoff from the mounds.

cium and magnesium in both soils (fables 1 and 2). Potassium is very low throughout the pedons while sodium
increases with depth. The cation exchange capacity (CEq
correlates highly with the clay distribution of the soils.
However, where cation exchange capacity/clay ratios are
compared, some irregularities can be seen (Fig. 4a and
4b). The cation exchange capacity percent clay ratios
show more clay mineral stratification in the mounded soil
than in the intermound soil. This may pertain to differences in illuviated fine clays which are dominated by montmorillonite or interstratified illite and montmorillonite.
Sodium increases in the B2t horizons of both profiles.
The exchangeable sodium of the mounded soil increases
to a maximum of 2.45 meq/ 100 g in the C horizon,
whereas that of the inter mound soil increases to a maximum of 4.15 meq/lOO g in the B3cn. The excessive sodium may be from the weathering of sodium feldspars and
the leaching of it to lower depths. Sodium clays are important to the development of "puffs" in gilgai in Australia
(3). The profile descriptions show glossic tongues to extend upward in the pedons (Fig. 5). These gray tongues
that interfinger the argillic horizon contain bleached soil
that is similar in texture and color to the A2 horizon.
These tongues contain many concretions. This suggests that
there has been much shrinking and swelling of the clays in
the previous years. The tongues have been in place for an
extended period as indicated by many medium size black

concretions lining the interior of the silt textured tongues.
This suggests that the fine clays moved down first, followed by the coarser, less expanding clays which formed a
separation between the tongues and the albic horizon. Since
the tongues do not extend into the upper part of the argillic
horizon, they are not emphasized in classification.
Percent base saturation exceeds 50% throughout the soil
profile of the mound, while that of the intermound decreases to a 49.2% in the A21 horizon. These high base
saturations may be significantly related to the increased
number of worm casts in the A2 horizons of the mounded
soils and to the effects of rodent activity in their surface
soils. Movement of soil from one horizon to another, cou~
pled with earthworm digestive effects on soil, are processes
that could affect soil development (7). The many worm
casts about the mound agree with the higher concentration
of earthworms in the mound (Pedon 3). Results of analyses show a greater increase in soluble or available phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium in
worm casts (5). Calcium in worm casts is mobile. When
this is considered, the analyses may be interpreted to further substantiate the concentration of earthworms in the
mound. Percentages of calcium are less in the A horizons
of the mounded soil than in the intermound soil but increase to a higher percentage with depth. Magnesium may be
less mobile than calcium. Magnesium averages much higher
in the mounded soil pedon than in the inter mound pedon.

The variance in base saturation of the epipedons differentiates the pedons of the mounded soil from those of the
intermound. Pedon 3 has sufficient base saturation for a
mollic epipedon. Pedon 0 of the inter mound has insufficient base saturation to meet the requirements of Moliisol
Classification as contained in the differentiation criteria
used in the 7th Approximation (11).
The data are a little low for extractable hydrogen in
Table 1 for the first four horizons of the intermound soils.
The analysis of new samples gave 5.2, 4.1, 3.2, and 2.8
meq/lOO g soil, respectively, for these horizons. These
figures provide a better agreement in the two methods for
measuring percent base saturation. These data do not
change the classification made of these soils. This variation may be due to the formation of ferrous iron under
reducing conditions of a perched water table during the
wet season and then changing to ferric iron under dry or
more oxidizing conditions. The ferrous iron replaces the

exchangeable cations when wet and then the hydrogen ion
exchanges with the ferrous iron during the drying out period. This is "ferrolysis" as explained by Dudal (R. Dudal.
1971. Planosols. Paper presented at joint meeting of Commissions V and VI of the ISSS, Pseudogleys and GleysGenesis and use of hydromorphic soils. Stuttgart, Germany). These soils have light colored A2 horizons that
contain many black concretions.
T oral Phosphorus-In comparison with calcium, phosphorus is not so easily translocated. Phosphorus averages
much higher in the mounded soil, Pedon 3, than in the
inter mound soil, Pedon 0, (Tables I and 2),
Particle Size Distributions-Particle size distributions
are found in Tables I and 2. Significant differences in textures are: the gradual increase in clay to the argillic horizon of the mounded soil, Pedon 3, and the more abrupt
increase in clay in the argillic of the inter mound Pedon O.
A different type movement of the soil plasma is suggested
which may be reason to classify them differently. The difference in weathering between the mounded soil and associated intermound soil also indicates that the mound has
been in place for a considerable period of time. Even
though the percentages of clay in the B21 t horizons in
the intermound and mound vary from 36.5 to 19.4, respectively, the upper boundaries of the B21t are at similar
levels in the mound and intermound as shown in Fig. 5.
The translocation of silt shows a similar pattern to that

37, 1973

of clay when a comparison is made between the two soils.
The silt content of the intermound, Pedon 0, is maximum
in the Al horizon and drops liharply in the A21 horizon.
The mounded soil, Pedon 3,- retains H high percentage of
silt throughout the A2 horizon.
The sand distribution of the surface horizons of the two
pedons is similar with a higher percentage present in the
A21 horizon of the inter mound soil. The percentage of
sand in the argillic of the mounded soil is slightly greater
than that of the intermound.
Bulk Density-The bulk density of the surface horizons
of mounded soils is consistently less than that of the associated intermound. The decrease in density averages between 14 and 20%. Crotovinas contained in the mounded
soil pedons bring about a density decrease of about 31 %
as compared to the pedons of the associated intermound.
The decrease in density is the result of the environmental
influence of the organisms which migrate to the mound to
escape seasonal wet soil conditions.
Classification of the Soils
Soils occurring at the study location and associated with
mounds are classified according to the system currently
in lise developed by the Soil Survey Staff, USDA (12)
(Table 3). Soil Classification in this system emphasizes
diagnostic horizons of the soil pedons. The soils are placed
in six categories: Order, Suborder, Great Group, Subgroup,
Family, and Series (Soil Survey Staff. USDA. 1960. 1967.
and others).
The major differences in morphological characteristics
of the mounded and inter mound soils are shown by the
more friable, less dense, and thicker surface horizons of
the mounded soil. Leaching is less in the mounded soil
with a consistently higher base saturation throughout the
pedons. Soil mottling and low chromas are deeper from
the surface than in the intermound soils. The lighter colors
of the A I and the low base saturation of A21, coupled
with the more abrupt clay increase of the argillic horizon,
clearly differentiate the mounded soils from the intermound soils. It is apparent that the significant difference
in the development of these soils is primarily traceable to
the effects of a high concentration of organisms in the
surface horizons of the mounded soils. Many crotovinas
and worm casts are characteristic of the mounded soils.
The pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius dutcheri) and the
mole (Sealopus aquaticus) were commonly observed

recognize these important biological influences. Vermic
is suggested. especially at the subgroup level. Also, a better
name for these mounds would be Verma, This is preferred
to Mirna (8). No vermic suhgroup has been included in
(he current soil classification system (12) with the taxonomic great group classification.
The mounded soils, Pedon-3, are classified according to
Soil Taxonomy as a coarse silty mixed, thermic Aquic
Argiudolls. They are distinguished from all other soils in
the vicinity of the study area at the Family level of classification (Table 3), Soil series for the mounded soils have
not been recognized in the present mapping of landscapes
containing them.
In the intermound area of Site I, Pedon-Q is separated
from the other soils mapped in the immediate area of the
Great Group level of classification. It is classified as a
fine, mixed, thermic Albaquic Hapludalf.
From the findings in this study and the results obtained
in other similar investigations of the mounds. it is evident
that organisms alter the mounded soils in measurable
amounts. The resulting effects establish a more highly fertile and porous surface soil with greater thickness than
that of the associated intermound. These aspects are consistently observed and may be predicted with a high degree
of certainty in the locations studied. Also, better soil survey interpretations for future crop uses will result from a
better understanding of the morphology, genesis, and classification of mounded soils or soils of verma mounds in
Oklahoma and surrounding states.

The friable, less dense AI horizon is an outstanding feature of the mounded soils (8). Because it is a prominent
morphological characteristic, it deserves consideration in
the taxonomic system of soil classification. Soils in the
mound possess qualities required by differentia criteria of
the 7th Approximation for a mollic epipedon (12). Adjacent intermound pedons lack the required qualities which
by comparison indicate the significance of contributions
by organisms to the mounded soils. These characteristics
suggest the modifier vermic be added to the classification
of the mounded soils. These mounds would be better
named as Verma mounds. Classification of the mounded
soils, according to the present differentia criteria of the 7th
Approximation, is coarse silt, mixed, thermic family of
Aquic Paleudolls or Aquic Argiudolls. The associated intermound pedon is a member of the fine, mixed, thermic
family of Albaquic Hapludalfs.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Numerous small mounds form a unique soil arrangement that covers many acres in eastern Oklahoma. This is
part of a vast area containing mounds that extend from
the southern part of Missouri to the coast of Texas. The
mounds averaging about 15 m in diameter and less than
one m in height. occur in densities of 8 to 16/ha.
Mounded soils investigated in east central Oklahoma
contained biological influences in soil formation when
compared to the associated intermound soils. Biological
activity was most common in mounded soBs which have
less mottlings than the intermound soils. Soil densities were
found to be consistently less in the surface horizons of
mounded soils than in the associated intermound soils.

An Ecological Interpretation for the Small Mounds in Landscapes of Eastern Oklahoma
F. P. Allgood and Fenton Gray

An Ecological Interpretation for the Small Mounds in Landscapes of Eastern Oklahoma 1
F. P. Allgood and Fenton Gray'
ABSTRACT

Many hypotheses suggesting the origin of small, oval, slightly
domed mounds haYe been proclaimed but none widely accepted.
Mounds typical to eastern Oklahoma were studied by relating
climatic influences, patterns, distributions, sizes, shapes, relief,
vegetation, and biological evidences to morphological characteristics of soil pedans within the mounds and associated landscape.
Laboratory measurements included particle-size distribution, bulk
density. extractable cations, and organic matter extractions.
Mounded soils occur in the greater than 102·cm rainfall belt on
landscapes having occasional perched water tables. The pattern of
the mounds which consists of sizes, shapes, and distribution is
Similar In these landscapes.
The average yield per hectare of forage was 4,997 kg on the
mounds as compared to 3,227 kg in the inter mound areas.
Evidence of biological activities is highly concentrated in
mounds, increasing in the soil horizons where mottlings decrease
due to decreasing wetness. Even though soil textures are similar,
bulk densities show soils to be more porous In the mound than In
the associated intermounds. The surface horizons of the mound
roils are apparently continually "fluffe(." by organisms and protected by a flourishing growth of vegetation sustained by the high
productivity of these soils.
Mounds are concluded to be natural phenomena resulting from
a soil environmental equilibrium, a condition created by the influence of a complex ecological association of a protective cover of
grasses, and organ.isms of the landscape assembling in selected
elevated soils to escape seasonal wet soil conditions.

Additional Index Words: ecological relationship, mima mounds,
biological origin.

A vast area of land comprising parts of Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana is dotted intermittently
with small, slightly domed, oval·shaped mounds. The
mounds average about 15 m in diameter and less than 1 m
in height. Common densities range from 8 to 16/ha.
Similar areas are found in California, Washington, Oregon,
Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, South Dakota, Minnesota,
and many other parts of the world. Fenneman (5) reo
ferred to these mounds as "pimpled plains," Nikiforoff
(9) "hogwallows," "Micro relief," and Scheffer (16)
"Mirna mounds."
These mounds have long been a
curiosity to observers. Many hypotheses have suggested
their origin but none have been widely accepted.
There are perhaps several kinds of mounds stemming
from different origins (6). The objectives of this paper
are (i) to present the ecological relationships responsible
for the construction of small "mima" mounds, (ii) to relate them to climate, vegetation, and biological activity,
and (iii) to present a hypothesis for the origin of these
mounds.
The study of a mounded soil area offers an opportunity
to compare the influences of soil fonning factors occur1Contribution from the Oklahoma Agr. Exp. Sta., Stillwater.

Mound distribution in Oklahoma was plotted on a climatography
map (V. S. Weather Bureau, 1960). Relative elevations and loca·
tions were surveyed by using a transit. for the 46 mounds in the
meadow which includes Site I. Backhoe equipment was employed
in making excavations of the representative mound.
Soil pedons, the smallest volumes of soil showing all horiz.ons, in
the mounds were measured. described, and compared to those in
the intermound. Bulk density samples were taken in triplicate in
the mound and associated intermound. Vegetation was measured
by a random transect method. For more detailed methods see

underlay the study site are interbedded gray silty to sandy shales,
siltstones. brown limestone, and medium·grained sandstone in the
Pennsylvania geological system as reported by Meeks 3 and Nef~.
Dominant slopes associated with the mounds in this area are nearly
level to gently sloping. The general slope of the area is northeast·
ward to the Arkansas River. The drainage of the meadow is to the
south. Associated elevation is about 180 m above sea level. The
climate is a temperate, continental, moist, subhumid type. Climatic
data for the location. summarized in the records of the U. S.
Weather Bureau, list the annual mean precipitation as 105.51 cm
with a mean annual temperature of 16.6C.
Tall grass prairies extend over the study area while forested
landscapes border local streams and cover rough broken uplands in
the immediate surroundings.
A mound was selected as Site I which occurs in a 5.2 ha native
meadow located in the northeast quarter of section 31, T. 13 N.,
R. 17 E. Muskogee County. Oklahoma. The kinds of soil found in
the mound and intermound were used as the nucleus of the study.
The meadow contained 46 mounds. Soils of other areas containing
mounds were examined and compared with those at Site I.

STUDY AREA

Location of Mounded Soils in Oklahoma-Figure 1
shows the general distribution of mounds in Oklahoma in
comparison of climatography of the associated area. As
indicated on the map, the boundary betw'een mounded
and intermounded soils approximate the l02·cm and
greater rainfall belt. Mounds are less numerous toward
the north and come to an abrupt ending near the west
boundary of this rainfall belt.
Topographic Measurements of Mounds in Site J- The
46 mounds located in the meadow containing Site I have
no definite pattern of arrangement except somewhat
similar shapes, sizes, volumes, heights, and. with a few exceptions, distances between them (Fig. 2).
Vegetatt'on-The vegetation of the meadow consisted
mainly of tall and mid grasses, sedges, and forbs. The
meadow had been used for hay production with no record of commercial fertilizer application during the past
25 years. The average yearly production of forage on the
mounded soils was 4,997 kg/ha compared to 3,227 kg/ha
from the intermound soils. Forage production from
heavily grazed ranges is often the reverse of these figur~s,
probably traceable to a more intense utilization by livestock of vegetation on the mound. A part of the increase
weight of forage from the mound was attributed to the
more bulky Eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum da.ctyloides)

Patterns, locations, and landscapes containing mounds were
studied in the area of occurrence in eastern Oklahoma. A study
was 'conducted in a selected area comprising the southern part of
Muskogee and a northern part of McIntosh Counties. Rocks that

which comprised 37% of the plant composItion on the
mound interspace area (Table 1). The scarcity of forbs
on the mound may be traceable to the roots of these
plants which are a desirable food of the pocket gopher
(Geomys bursarius dutcheri). These rodents are commonplace within the mounds during wet seasons.
Characteristics of Soil Pedons at Site I

Elevations of soil horizons and special features in a 90°
direction from true north in the mounded and intermound
soils are shown in Fig. 3. Mounded soils have a 60% increase in thickness of the Al and a 50% increase in the A2
horizons toward the interior of the mound as compared
to the intermound sojls. Elevations of the upper and
lower boundaries of the argillic horizon or layer of clay
accumulation have similar positions in the mounded soils
and intermound soils. Soil horizons of the intermound
contain smooth boundaries and are relatively consistent in
width, in contrast to the more varied horizons of the
mounded soils.
A significant difference between pedons of the mound
and intermound is the percentage of clay present in the
upper boundaries of the illuviated layers or B horizons.
Clay translocation in the intermound pedon shows an
abrupt textural change between the eluviated A2 and
illuviated B horizons; in the mounded soil pedon, the B 1,
a transitional horizon which shows a gradual clay increase,
forms at the upper boundary of the argillic horizons (B2t)
(Fig. 4 and 5).
The uniform, thick Al horizon and the increase in
thickness of the A2 horizon toward the interior of the
mounds is evidence that the mounds have been in place
for a long time. This is further supported by the gradual
textural change into the argillic horizons of the mounded

soils. Nikiforoff (9) reported similar conditions while
studying mounds on hard pan soils in California. He referred to these conditions as "windows" in the hardpan.
Ross, Tester, and Breckenridge (15) reported a diffe:ence
in clay distribution in the mound compared to the mtermound area. This is because there are more mixing ac·
tions in the mounded soils which resist and interfere with
the processes of eluviation and illuviation. Simi.larities in
the elevations of the upper and lower boundanes of the
argillic horizon in the mound and the .intermound indic~te
the horizon boundaries were estabhshed before the mception of the'mound.
Biological Evidences

A close correlation exists between the degree of mottlings and evidences of biological activity. Where mottling
due to extended wetness decreases, evidence of biological
activity increases. The argillic horizons were void of worm
casts and crotovinas, but crotovinas in the A horizons
were numerous and were classed as new an~ old. Croto·
vinas are special soil formations which consist of nests and
passageways of rodents that are filled with soil materials
coming from above horizons. Those classed. as old. con·
tained soil structure similar to the surroundmg horIZon.
Those classed as new contained structure in the interior
contrasting to the surrounding soil. The location of the
older crotovinas were consistently in the lower depths
(Fig. 3). Measurements of exposed crotovinas r.anged between 4 and 12 em in diameter. Four exceptIOns were
measured ranging between 18 and 34 em. Two contai.ned
evidences of litter in the soil mass. Several crotovmas
were observed to contain a platy "onion skin" structure
around the outer walls. Crotovinas in two exposures contained lighter-colored soil material than that of the sur·
rounding materials. The Iighter·colored soil material was
apparently moved upward by rodents from the A2
horizon.
A small crotovina was found "extending downward to
the upper surface of the argillic horizon. Sci.enti~ts have
been puzzled with the downshafts fo: som~ time III mole
fortresses in England and the Neurotnchus m Oregon (3).
Some observers have speculated that these structures are

wells to supply water for the mole (1), especially in dry
years.
Large volumes of organic matter were added to mounds
in the form of rodent nests. New and old nests were often
encountered in the mound sites investigated. Glasss reported that these nests were primarily constructed by the
pocket gopher. The pocket gopher increases in number
within the mounds from the fall until late spring. Mounds
are favorite places to deliver their young, probably because they offer dryer conditions. Their gestation period
is from late winter to early spring which coincides with
the wettest season in this region.
The pocket gopher is reported by Glasss to be found as
far west as the central part of Oklahoma. This territory
extends well over 100 miles west of the area occupied by
the mounds.
Another animal visitor to the mounds is the Eastern or
common mole (Sealopus aquatieus) which also delivers its
young in the higher elevations of wet landscapes. They
also visit the mounds in search of the earthworm (Lum~
bricus terrestris) and the white grub (Lachnosterna fusca)
-common foods (2). The active territory of the Eastern
or common mole extends across Oklahoma excluding the
Panhandle (10).
In landscapes containing mounds, a perched water table
on dense substrata consisting of rock or clay is a common
feature during the wet seasons of the year. In Site I, water
accumulates on the surface of the clay·textured (argillic)

horizon for several days following periods of precipitation.
This condition may persist throughout the winter and
spring months. Migration of rodents to the mounds is associated with the arrival of cool or wet weather. It is also
evident that the mound is a choice habitat for other organisms such as earthworms. The hydrologic condition of
the microlandscape also influences the choice of soil by
the earthworms.
Parker and Parskley (11) gave evidence of the migration
of earthworms according to favorable moisture and temperature (8). It has also been demonstrated that earth·
worms move into soil material high in organic matter
(12, 13). The decayed material of the many nests aban·
doned by the pocket gopher and the mole in the mounded
soils of eastern Oklahoma probably accounts for the con·
siderable concentration or the earthworm In these soils.
Worm channels were numerous in the Al horizon of the
mounded soils and especially in the dark-colored crotovinas. The presence of earth worms may contribute to
the greater forage yields on the mounds of the meadow
containing Site 1. This is supported by Lunt and Jacobson (7) who found greater increases in available P, exchangeable K and Mg in worm casts than in adjoining
soils. The increases were threefold to eleven fold greater
than the surrounding soil. Campbell, cited by Prosser
(12), concluded from his study that the earthworm pos·
sesses a urea cycle. This cycle may be a N source. Robertson (14) showed that earthworm may decompose calcium
carbonate concretions in their calciferous glands and the
secretions containing Ca are mixed with the food source.
Secretion can take place under arid, neutral, or alkaline

conditions provided the worm has access to material containing calcium carbonate.
The base saturation was greater than 50% throughout
the mounded soil pedan while that of the intermound
pedon dropped below 50% in the A2 horizon.
Higher concentrations of earthworms about the mound
undoubtedly contribute to the friable condition of the
epipedon. Darwin (4) reported that 25 to 53 thousand
worms per acre would pass ten to eighteen tons of soil
annually through their alimentary tracts. The significance
of earthworm contributions to the more porous epipedon
of mounded soils may be the causal factor of lower soil
bulk density in the mounded soil when ~ompared to the
associated intermound (Fig. 6). As the soil bulk density
is decreased, the volume is increased, which could account
for a part of the mound's existence.
Erosion Effects on Mound Sizes

Sheet erosion between the mounds acting over a long
period of time is also considered significant in contribut·
ing to the height of the mounds. Supporting this con·
elusion is the greater variation of the heigh ts of mounds
in areas of concentrated surface drainage.
The mounds resistance to erosion is part of an equilib.
rium imposed by natural inhabitants of the mounds. As
inhabitants of the mound function to sustain their own
preservation, they contribute to the existence of the
mound.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Small mounds are closely associated with the 102 -cm
plus rainfall belt and slowly permeable soils in Oklahoma.
A typical mound in a 5.2-ha meadow containing 46
mounds was studied in Muskogee County of eastern
Oklahoma (Site I).
The mound in this study occurs on an old landform
having subsoils high in clay. Some mounds occur where
impervious rock formations at a shallow depth restrict the
downward movement of water. The soil with a very slow·
ly permeable subsoil is not favorable for the survival of
most living organisms in the soil environment because of

its extreme wet conditions at critical times during the
year.
All evidence of biological activity was found above the
slowly and very slowly permeable argillic horizons of the
soil pedons. Biological activity increased as mottling due
to wetness decreased. Greater biological concentration
within the mound affected the properties of the mounded
soils. The Al horizon of the mounded soils was lower in
soil bulk densities. The mounded soils were higher in base
saturations and contained more transitional horizons (A3
or B 1) between the A2 and B2t horizons.
Production· of grasses, in the well.managed meadow
containing Site I, was greater on the mound soil than on
the intermound soil.
Soil bulk density was consistently found to be less in
the mounded soil epipedons than in the associated intermound area. The expansion of the densities of the intermound soil to the densities of the mounded soils would in
part account for the height and size of the mound. Sheet
erosion in the intermound areas also contributes to an increase in size of the mound by removing soil from the
fringes of the mound and from the interspace.

Morphology and Development of Sodie Soils in Eastern Oklahoma
Elena 1. Jigoulina and Brian J. Carter, Dept of Plant and Soil Sciences
Oklahoma State University
Soils with high sodium content (solonetzes) may have deteriorated structure
characterized by dispersion. Dispersion is a repulsion of negatively charged particles
enhanced by sodium. Soils that disperse are susceptible to erosion and piping. Failures
of structures built on such soils occur at first wetting. Extensive maintenance is often
needed for construction for which dispersive soils are used. Deteriorated structure of
sodic soils and high sodium content impose serious problems to growth of most crops.
Sodic soils and their extremes - slickspots are encountered throughout Oklahoma. Using
sodic soils in road construction causes serious problems: erosion tunnels, holes in
embankments after rainfall, and sub grade subsidence resulting in cracks in pavement.
Unique physical properties of sodic soils are a mirror of their chemical
composition. Sodic soils have high sodium adsorption ratio of more than l3,
exchangeable sodium percentage of more than 15 and they are usually strongly alkaline.
They also have a low salt concentration that along with a high sodium content causes
dispersion phenomenon.
Dispersive soils have not been definitely associated with any specific geologic
deposits but most have been found as alluvial clays in the form of slope wash, lake bed
deposits, loess deposits and flood plain deposits. Dispersive soils can be associated with
shales, granites and sandstones. Clay minerals found associated with dispersive behavior
are smectite and illite. Sodium salts may be derived from parent material or they can be

brought in by external agents such as wind or water. A chief source of excess sodium in
solonetz soils is mineral sodium from parent material. Other sources are calcareous till,
ocean spray, salts brought in by rain, ground water seepage, presence ofunpermeable
layers interrupting leaching.
In Muskogee county outcropping rocks consist mainly of Pennsylvanian
sandstones, shales and coals deposited on lowlands and in shallow seas that once covered
much of eastern Oklahoma. In many parts of the county these sedimentary rocks are
mantled by unconsolidated alluvium (sand, silt or clay) laid down by ancient or modem
rivers and streams. The alluvium is eroded from the rock units within and to the west of
the county. Quaternary sediments were laid down mainly as a flood plain or alluvial
deposits along major rivers flowing predominantly to the east, southeast and northeast
across the county. The salts in this sediment can originate from Permian halite beds
located in western Oklahoma. Ancient streams carried salt-charged sediments and
deposited them downstream. Weathering of such deposits supplies salts in the soil
solution. Salts may have come from ground water during evaporation under periods of
temporary excessive moisture interspersed with dry periods. The latter occurs in eastern
Oklahoma.
If sodium salts comprise a sufficiently high percentage ofthe total soluble salts of
the soil, a significant part of the base exchange complex of the soil will be replaced by
sodium. In presence of sodium, soil develops columnar structure and exhibits a high
degree of dispersion. Under high electrolytes concentration (Ee more than 4 dS/m)
deflocculation of clay particles is less pronounced and does not reach critical values.
Other factors that may account for soil dispersion characteristics are: clay mineralogy

(smectites are more proned to dispersion than other clays), organic matter content,
texture. Future studies are needed to solve these phenomena.

Reclamation of a Sodic Soil in Leflore Co., Oklahoma
Using Chemical Amendments
Dejene Alemayehu, Brian J. Carter, and Phillip A. Ward III, Dept. of Plant & Soil
Sciences, Oklahoma State University.
Sodic soils are recognized as slickspots, alkali spots, natric horizons and solonetz
(Mutter, 1972). Nearly 900,000 acres ofland in Oklahoma are affected by excessive
amounts of soluble salts (Reed, 1972). Sodic soils usually have poor physical and
chemical properties, particularly when the electrolyte or dissolved concentration of the
soil solution is inadequate to compensate for the effects of excessive exchangeable
sodium (Oster et aI., 1995). The level ofNa+ in a soil system is usually described by
exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) or the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of the soil
solution which reflects the relative balance between Na+ and combined Ca2+ plus Mg2+ in
the soil solution.
Reclamation of sodic soils can be achieved by applying chemical amendments to
lower the exchangeable sodium percentage below 15. Chemical amendments are
materials that supply a divalent cation, such as calcium, to replace the exchangeable
sodium on the clay (ASCE, 1990). The calcium may originate from the dissolution of
Ca2+ containing amendments or irrigation water that contains Ca2+. Sodic soils can be
reclaimed by leaching with or without a chemical amendment added to the soil or
irrigation water (Miyamota and Emiquez, 1990). The kind and amount of chemical
amendment to be used for reclaiming sodic soil depends upon the soil characteristics, the
solubility of the amendments, cost and the concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in each
amendment.
Chemical amendments for sodic soil reclamation are broadly categorized into
soluble calcium salts (gypsum, CaCh, Ca(OH)2), acids or acid forming substances
(sulfuric acid), industrial wastes (fly ash, cement kiln dust), and soil conditioners (organic
humate). The suitability of an amendment for sodic soil reclamation is largely dependent
on the nature of the soil, cost, and effective time required to displace Na+ from the
exchange site. Limestone (CaC03) is an effective amendment mainly for soils having a
pH of below 7 because the solubility of limestone decreases (Abrol, et aI., 1988) with
increasing soil pH.
Gypsum is a white material that occurs extensively in the western part of
Oklahoma. Gypsum reacts with both sodium carbonate in the soil solution and with
colloidial soil the complex:
Na2C03 + CaS04~CaC03 +Na2S04 (leachable)
Na-Clay Micelle + CaS04~Ca-Micelle + Na2S04 (leachable)
Sulfuric acid is an oily corrosive liquid and is usually about 95% in concentrated
form. Sulfuric acid combined with other amendments to soils that contain calcium
carbonate, reacts to form CaS04 and provides soluble Ca2+ indirectly:

1

Na2C03 + H2S04~C02 +H20 +Na2S04 (leachable)
CaC03 + H2S04~ CaS04 + CO2 +H20
Na.Clay Micelle + CaS04~Ca+Micelle + Na2S04 (leachable
The purpose of this study is to identify the best amendments available to the
Oklahoma Department of Transportation (the funding agency) for decreasing the
exchangeable sodium percentage of sodic soils below 15. It is assumed this will cause
these soils to be less dispersive and usable for road construction purposes.

Methods and Materials
Wing (Leflore) is one of the soil series being used for the application of chemical
amendments. Leflore Co. is in the southeastern part of Oklahoma and within the
Arkansas Valley and Ouachita Mountain physiographic sections (Fig. 1). The soil is
formed from deep, moderately drained, nearly level alluvium. The study site is low in
fertility, the surface tends to crust and the area becomes susceptible to severe erosion.
Soil collected from the Bt horizon of the Wing soil profile at a depth of20-41 cm
was air dried and ground to pass a 2-mm sieve. About 250-g soil was mixed with 5t!ac of
chemical amendments (gypsum, fly ash, hydrated lime, humate and cement kiln dust) and
sulfuric acid. The amended soil mixture was saturated with distilled water to a paste
consistency and allowed to stand overnight to dissolve salts. Water containing soluble
salts is extracted and the amounts ofCa2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+ were determined by atomic
absorption spectrophotometry. The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) which is directly
related to the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) (Fig.2) was determined to evaluate
the level of sodicity. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) expressed in cmol/kg, was
measured using a method designed for salty soils and carbonates (Sumner and Miller,
1996).

Results and Discussion
The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of the soil solution that defines the soil
sodicity problem is quantitatively related to pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of the
soil solution. Measurements of pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and SAR are
summarized in Table 1. Gypsum, cement kiln dust and humate caused a decrease in SAR
from 22 to 6. These can be considered as effective treatments for the Wing (Leflore) Bt
horizon. Hydrated lime and fly ash were less effective in reducing SAR in the Bt
horizon. The sulfuric acid applied reacts with soil calcium carbonate (CaC03) producing
a soluble source of calcium and calcium sulfate (Abrol, 1982). Other researchers
(prather, et aI., 1978; Abrol, et aI., 1988; Miyamoto et aI., 1975) confirmed that use of
sulfuric acid with other amendments is an effective treatment in the reclamation of sodic
soils.
Multiple leaching of the amended soils with distilled water reduced the SAR
(Table 1 & Fig. 3) and is the most effective procedure for removing the very soluble
sodium salts (sodium chloride, sodium sulfate and sodium bicarbonates). Leaching a
sodic soil with low electrolyte water reduces the SAR of the soil solution. The use of
amendments and leaching together helps to increase infiltration and provides a

Early Hunter-Gatherer Occupation
in the Arkoma Basin of Eastern Oklahoma

Abstract
This paper briefly summarizes the Paleo indian evidence from the Arkoma Basin of
eastern Oklahoma. The Arkansas and Canadian rivers provided important corridors for
human migration during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Unfortunately,
archaeologists have not employed the deep testing strategies necessary to retrieve this
information. Rather, interested avocationists have amassed evidence fortuitously exposed
by lake impoundment and channel improvement. Despite their origin, these collections are
being used to piece together the dynamic prehistory of the Arkoma Basin during
Paleo indian times.
Chronology and Adaptation
Although several archaeological investigations have occurred in the Arkoma Basin
of eastern Oklahoma, none have revealed Paleo indian or Early Archaic materials in a
datable context. Archaeologists have understandably emphasized the magnificent
Mississippian and'Woodland mounds and villages which were occupied between 3000 and
500 years ago. Evidence of earlier groups occupying the Arkoma Basin exists in a small
number of private collections gathered from gravel bars, lake shores, and other secondary
deposits (Figure I).
Early Paleoindian
Although transient groups may have visited the Arkoma Basin much earlier, the
oldest archaeological evidence is Clovis-age (Meltzer 1989). These were small bands of
highly mobile hunter-gatherers who pursued mammoth, mastodon, bison, horse, camel,
deer, ground sloth, wolf, rabbit, giant turtle, and other small game between 11,400 and
10,900 years ago (see Ferring 1994; Frison 1991; Graham et al. 1981; Haynes 1987, 1993;
Hofman 1996). Fossil finds and river-rolled Clovis spear points (Figure 2a) from the
Arkoma Basin demonstrate the presence oflate Pleistocene fauna and human populations,
but reveal little else about Clovis settlement in the region. The environment witnessed by
Clovis groups in the Arkoma Basin was a dissipating late-glacial woodland with boreal
conifers (Holloway 1994), a forest habitat that would not retum to the area until about
1000 years ago and is today expressed as the Osage Savanna of scrub-oak and hickory
(Blair and Hubbell 1938).
Evidence of Folsom occupation in the Arkoma Basin is equally illusive. Dated
between 10,900 and 10,200 years ago on the Plains (Haynes et al. 1992), Folsom groups

adapted to increased seasonality and predictability of plant and animal resources during the
late Pleistocene-early Holocene transition (Bement 1999; Holliday 1995). With their
emphasis on bison, Folsom hunters may have followed herds that ranged into the eastern
prairie that developed in the Arkoma Basin after Clovis times (Wyckoff 1999). Evidence
for these scenario exists (Figure 2b), but is admittedly scant. A single Folsom point is
recorded for the Arkoma Basin.

Late Paleoindian
In relation to Early Paleo indian finds, evidence for Late Paleo indian occupation in
the Arkoma Basin is abundant. These groups' remains are not only more common, but are
also better distributed across the landscape than Clovis and Folsom. Plainview, Cody, and
other Plains-oriented complexes apparently visited eastern Oklahoma (Johnson 1989;
Wyckoff 1985), but their activities are overshadowed by the numerous Dalton artifacts
reported from the region (Figure 2c). Buried Dalton camps have not been excavated in
the Arkoma Basin, but are known to occur deep in the terraces above the Canadian River
and beneath the floodplains of alluviated valleys such as Sans Bois Creek. Dated between
10,500 and 9,900 years ago in the rockshelters of Missouri (Goodyear 1982; Rayet al.
1998), and 9600 years ago at the Packard site in Mayes County, Oklahoma (Wyckoff
1989), the Dalton Horiwn demonstrates population growth and the seasonal relocation of
habitation sites. Targeting modem game such as deer, squirrel, raccoon, turkey, turtles,
and fish, Dalton groups were among the first hunter-gatherers of eastern North America to
regularly reuse upland rockshelters and lowland habitation sites and cemeteries (Morse
1997; Walthall 1998a,b).
Archaeologists generally associate the Dalton Horizon with a forest economy.
Dalton groups in the Arkoma Basin, however, adapted to an early Holocene prairie with
forest communities probably confined to lowland valleys (Holloway 1994). There is no
evidence that these people hunted prairie game such as bison, but subtle differences in the
tools they used indicate that they relied less on wood as a source of fuel and raw material
(Ballenger 1998). A model of Dalton settlement in the Arkoma Basin, based on a pattern
of tool stone selection and use, argues that two Dalton macro bands used the region
(Ballenger 1999; Wyckoff and Bartlett 1995). These macro bands, prohably consisting of
several hundred individuals organized into smaller kin groups, were tethered to upland
settings in the Ozark and Ouachita mountains that provided winter shelter and lithic raw
materials. Preparation for winter stays in the uplands included fall aggregations in the
Arkansas River Basin. At large sites such as McKellips and Billy Ross, Dalton groups
from the Ozark and Ouachita mountains came together for brief periods of time to feast on
fatty game, exchange knowledge and mates, and perform important ceremonies. Farther
from major valleys, in the hills near Checotah, Oklahoma, smaller camps were made by
Dalton groups hunting along Dirty Creek. The Hoyt locality, a series of gravel bars below
Lake Eufaula, has also yielded hundreds of Dalton points likely discarded at large camps
located in the floodplain and on the terraces of the Canadian River.
Billy Ross, Accidental Archaeologist
In 1970, under the authority of the River and Harbor Act (1946), the Corps of
Engineers began construction of the Sans Bois Navigation Channel. Among those farmers

whose lives were indelibly shaped by this project is Mr. Billy Ross. The benefits of having
a major navigation system in one's backyard were potentially great. Property values were
expected to skyrocket as recreation dollars replaced farm revenues. As such ventures
sometimes go, however, Mr. Ross still awaits his fortune. It is probably safe to assume
that Mr. Ross never expected the navigation system to cause him to amass a large
collection of stone tools once buried in the Sans Bois floodplain, or to own a dog named
"Clovis." Consequently, he has spent a virtual career pondering the lifeways of Dalton
groups, piecing together broken tools, aud sharing those finds with the archaeological
community.
The Billy Ross collection first came about by dredging in the early 1970s. The
construction of a 14-mile-long channel varying in width from 225-250 feet aud with a
minimum depth of 9 feet required that a significaut amount of sediment be removed from
the drainage. Dredged deposits were dumped adjacent to the creek aud these "spoil piles"
contained the artifacts in the Billy Ross site collection. Although it is impossible to
confidently reconstruct the stratigraphic position of the Paleoindiau materials recovered by
Mr. Ross, his recollections indicate that the artifacts were buried deep in the floodplain.
Mr. Ross visited the site for a period of three years, recovering approximately 200 Dalton
points.
Since the mid-1970s archaeologists have been invited to examine aud appreciate
the Billy Ross site (34Hs-90). Representing the largest Dalton assemblage from eastern
Oklahoma, the collection gained scholarly attention after being documented by Galm aud
Hofman (1984). Since that time a second aualysis has been performed to supplement the
primary author's MA thesis (Ballenger 1999). The Billy Ross collection provides insight
to the distribution of significant Dalton far west of the Mississippi River Valley as well as
Dalton settlement patterns in eastern Oklahoma. Mr Ross' careful preservation of these
artifacts aud his wholehearted willingness to share this information with others is greatly
appreciated.

Don G. Wyckoff

Around 1400 years ago,
people residing in the
northern Ouachita Mountains
began migrating northward
up the Arkansas River and
its many tributaries that
drain the Ozark Mountains
and the east edge of the
Cherokee Prairie. These
people established settlements and by A.D. 900 they
were building mound-dominate
community centers at several
strategic points in the
region. The material cultur
of these people is called th
Arkansas Basin Caddoan
tradition. For 1000 years
they controlled the region,
but around A.D. 1400 they
underwent marked cultural
change, becoming part-time
farmers and bison-hunters
\'lith an egalitarian society.
Today, we ~1i11 tour the

. The origins of the Arkansas Basin Caddoan cultural
tradition lie in the Archaic period, some 3500 years ago,
when hunting-gathering people flourished in the northernmost
valleys of the Ouachita Mountains. Along the Poteau River
and such tributaries as the Fourche Maline, numerous sites
occur. Frequently these are thick midden accumulations that
are generally stratified with prepottery (and pre-arrow)
deposits on the bottom and pottery, arrowpoints, hoes, and
axes occurring in the top. The prepottery artifacts are
attributed to the Wister Phase, whereas the early pottery
and arrow-bearing materials are considered representative
of the Fourche Maline phase. This latter seems to start
around A.D. 300, and the pottery bears marked similarities
to Baytown ceramics common to the Lower Mississippi Valley.
There is continuity in many artifact styles between the
Wister and Fourche Maline phases, and burials of the two
phases are anatomically similar, thus the interpreted
tie between Arkansas Basin Caddoans and earlier Archaic folk.
Around A.D. 600 there is evidence of warfare between
Fourche Maline folks and residents of the western Ozarks,
and by A.D. 700 Fourche Maline folks are establishing camps
and settlements along the Arkansas River and the 10l1er course
of the Grand and Illinois rivers. Apparently around this tim,
Fourche Maline folks begin practicing horticulture. By A.D.
800, Fourche Maline people are dominant in the Arkansas Basir.
of northeast Oklahoma and they seem to be carrying on some
kind of ties (trade, communication, subjugation?) with mound
building people of a general Coles Creek cultural tradition
found in the lower Arkansas River Valley around Little Rock,
Arkansas.

The period of A.D. 800 to
1000 is sometimes called the
Evans phase. It was during
these 200 years that Arkansas
Basin Caddoans firmly establishe
themse 1ves in the regi on and
set up community centers at
or near strategic points, usuall
near the. confluence of maj or
streams. By A.D. 900 such
centers and their supportive
settlements were spread as far
north as shown to the ri ght,
and similar sites are known well
into the Ozarks of Missouri and
Arkansas. This was the time of
a developing elite, a hierarchy
of priestly chiefs. There is
some reason to believe two
political-religious centers
vied for power, the Harlan site
(Ck-6 to the right) and the Spiro
site (Lf-46). Both locati ons
were periodically the scenes

Notable cultural change
seems to start around A.D. 1200.
At this time, many villages and
centers along the northern and
\'/estern margins of settlement are
abandoned and there is increasing
population along the Arkansas Rive
from Muskogee to Ft. Smith. From
A.D. 1200·to 1400 is the period
called the Spiro phase; it was
during this period that a large
cemetery floor was prepared at
Spiro and dedar log litters containing the remains of dead elite
were placed on this floor. These
burials have yielded more engraveG
marine shell and more copper
artifacts than any site north of
Mexico.
During the Spiro phase, a
sizeable population was living
around the Spiro site, but there
is no evi dence that anyone was
actually residing at the site.

By A.D. 1450, Arkansas Basin Caddoan have
apparently stopped building mounds, participating
in long-distance trade 11ith Southeastern chiefdoms
and abandoned their ranked social system. Instead,
they are increasingly hunting bison on a seasonal
....
basis and occupying villages that are characterized i
by smaller, less permanent houses and more numerous I
trash pits than ever used before. These settlemen~s
.......
are frequently on sandy soils, and there is eviden:c
for more use of bone, rather than stone, for horticultural implements.
The A.D. 1400 to 1550 period is represented
by the Ft. Coffee phase. As during the previous
Spiro phase, most settlements are along the
Arkansas Ri ver be low Muskogee and the lower course
of the Illinois River. But many reused temporary
camps are known for the interior Ozarks and along
major streams draining the Cherokee Prairie.
Most likely, the cultural changes evidenced
among Arkansas Basin Caddoans were stimulated by
climatic fluctuation resulting in lessened summer
precipitation. The shifting of people to the
Ankansas River Valley below Muskogee concentrated
these horticulturalists in the area where, during
the 1930s droughts, summer rainfall was probably
eunuoo(1fT
80 to 90% of normal. While this permitted sus• un euo,
"
taining their horticultural, ranked society for
"'ill~"
several hundred years, it also stimulated nevI
adaptations, namely seasonal hunting of bison most
probably in the Cherokee Prairie and at hunting
grounds even farther west.

Major streams ~n the Arkansas Basin of eastern
Oklahoma. Caddoan people's ability to use these waterways for
travel, trade, and communication is shown by the man-in-boat engraved

Around 1400 years ago,
people residing in the
northern Ouachita Mountains
began migrating northward
up the Arkansas River and
its many tributaries that
drain the Ozark Mountains
and the east edge of the
Cherokee Prairie. These
people established settlements and by A.Do 900 they
were building mound-dominate(
community centers at several
strategic points in the
region. The material culturE
of these people is called thE
Arkansas Basin Caddoan
tradition. For 1000 years
they controlled the region,
but around A.D. 1400 they
underwent marked cultural
change, becoming part-time
farmers and bison-hunters
with an egalitarian society.
Today, we will tour the
heartland of their homeland.

. The origins of the Arkansas Basin Caddoan cultural
tradition lie in the Archaic period, some 3500 years ago,
when hunting-gathering people flourished in the northernmost
valleys of the Ouachita Mountains. Along the Poteau River
and such tributaries as the Fourche Maline, numerous sites
occur. Frequently these are thick midden accumulations that
are generally stratified with prepottery (and pre-arrow)
deposits on the bottom and pottery, arrowpoints, hoes, and
axes occurring in the top. The prepottery artifacts are
attributed to the Wister Phase, whereas the early pottery
and arrow-bearing materials are considered representative
of the Fourche Maline phase. This latter seems to start
around A.D. 300, and the pottery bears marked similarities
. to Baytown ceramics common to the Lower Mississippi Valley.
There is continuity in many artifact styles between the
Wister and Fourche Maline phases, and burials of the two
phases are anatomically similar, thus the interpreted
tie between Arkansas Basin Caddoans and earlier Archaic folk.
Around A.D. 600 there is evidence of warfare between
Fourche Maline folks and residents of the western Ozarks,
and by A.D. 700 Fourche Maline folks are establishing camps
and settlements along the Arkansas River and the lower course!
of the Grand and Illinois rivers. Apparently around this ti~'
Fourche Maline folks begin practicing horticulture. By A.D.
800, Fourche Maline people are dominant in the Arkansas Basil.
of northeast Oklahoma and they seem to be carrying on some
kind of ties (trade, communication, subjugation?) with mound
building people of a general Coles Creek cultural tradition
found in the lower Arkansas River Valley around Little Rock,
Arkansas.

The period of A.D. 800 to
1000 is sometimes called the
Evans phase. It was during
these 200 years that Arkansas
Basin Caddoans firmly estab1ishc
themselves in the region and
set up community centers at
or near strategic points, usua11
near the. confluence of major
streams. By A.D. 900 such
centers and their supportive
settlements were spread as far
north as shown to the ri ght,
and similar sites are known well
into the Ozarks of Missouri and
Arkansas. This was the time of
a developing elite, a hierarchy
of priestly chiefs. There is
some reason to believe two
political-religious centers
vied for power, the Harlan site
(Ck-6 to the right) and the Spiro
site (Lf-46). Both locations
were periodically the scenes

Notable cultural change
seems to start around A.D. 1200.
At this time, many villages and
centers along the northern and
western margins of settlement are
abandoned and there is increasing
population along the Arkansas RivE'1
from Muskogee to Ft. Smith. From
A.D. 1200'to 1400 is the period
called the Spiro phase; it was
during this period that a large
cemetery floor was prepared at
Spiro and de dar log litters containing the remains of dead elite
were placed on this floor. These
burials have yielded more engravea
marine shell and more copper
artifacts than any site north of
Mexico.
During the Spiro phase, a
sizeable population was living
around the Spiro site, but there
is no evi dence that anyone was
actually residing at the site.

By A.D. 1450, Arkansas Basin Caddoan have
apparently stopped building mounds, participating
in long-distance trade with Southeastern chiefdoms
and abandoned their ranked social system. Instead,
.....
they are increasingly hunting bison on a seasonal
basis and occupying villages that are characterized
by smaller, less permanent houses and more numerous
trash pits than ever used before. These settlemen~s
........
are frequently on sandy soils, and there is eviden:c
for more use of bone, rather than stone, for horticultural implements.
The A.D. 1400 to 1550 period is represented
by the Ft. Coffee phase. As during the previous
Spiro phase, most settlements are along the
Arkansas River below Muskogee and the lower course
of the Illinois River. But many reused temporary
camps are known for the interior Ozarks and along
major streams draining the Cherokee Prairie.
Most likely, the cultural changes evidenced
among Arkansas Basin Caddoans were stimulated by
climatic fluctuation resulting in lessened summer
precipitation. The shifting of people to the
Ankansas River Valley below Muskogee concentrated
these horticulturalists in the area where, during
the 1930s droughts, summer rainfall was probably
80 to 90% of normal. While this permitted sustaining their horticultural, ranked society for
several hundred years, it also stimulated new
adaptations, namely seasonal hunting of bison most
probably in the Cherokee Prairie and at hunting
grounds even farther west.

CULTURAL SETTING OF THE WISTER, OKLAHOMA AREA
B. Largent, Jr.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Wister Lake region has long been the focus of intense archeological scrutiny.
Wister Lake was authorized for flood control and conservation by the Flood Control Act
of 1938. The project was designed and built by the USACE, Tulsa District. Construction
began in April 1946, and the project was placed in full flood control operation in
December 1949. In response to the proposed impoundment of Wister Lake, the Tulsa
District sponsored cultural resources management projects in the study area. Beginning in
1946, the process of inventory and assessment of cultural properties in this area has
resulted in the documentation of207 sites, including 180 prehistoric sites, 16 historic sites,
four multicomponent prehistoriclhistoric sites, and seven sites that remain unassigned
temporally due a lack of sufficient records. The first archeological projects in the area
were salvage projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and
administered through the University of Oklahoma's Department of Anthropology. The
total acreage surveyed and the total number of sites excavated by the WPA remains
unknown. Twenty-four sites were recorded and excavated between 1940 and 1942
(GuiIinger 1971; Howard 1941; Lawton 1960; Newkumet 1940a, 1940b, 1940c, 1940d,
1940e, 1940f; Proctor 1957; Sharrock 1960). The University of Oklahoma (Watson
1947) recorded nine new sites during a brief 1946 survey. An intensive survey and the
excavation offour sites in 1947-1948 by the University of Oklahoma (Bell 1947, 1949,
1953) provided data for an archeological synthesis (Bell and Baerreis 1951) and the
definition of the Fourche Maline focus (Krieger 1947). No further work was carried out
at Wister Lake until 1965, when Bell tested one additional site. Three sites were later
tested by the Oklahoma Anthropological Society between 1967 and 1969, and Burton
(1970) later investigated site 34CH-112 in Choctaw County. In the same year, GuiIinger
(1971) conducted archeological investigations at the Copeland site, a Fourche Maline site
in LeFlore County.
In 1973, Bell published a report concerning the cultural manifestations in the
Wister Lake region (Bell 1973), and, in 1974, the University of Oklahoma resurveyed
portions of Wister Lake in response to a proposed increase in the level ofthe conservation
pool. A total of26 sites was relocated, and 23 new sites were recorded (Mayo 1975; Neal
and Mayo 1974). Limited testing was carried out at several sites. Twenty-one previously
recorded sites could not be relocated due to inundation or vegetation cover (Mayo 1975).
The University of Oklahoma, in conjunction with the Oklahoma Anthropological Society,
excavated one site (34LT-ll) between 1976 and 1977 (Wyckoff 1976, 1979; Wyckoff and
Woody 1977). A mitigation project, referred to as the Wister Lake Archaeological
Project, was developed based on Neal and Mayo's recommendations (Mayo 1975), and 14
sites and three localities were tested (Galm 1978a, 1978b; Galm and Flynn 1978a, 1978b).
In 1975, the Wister Lake Archaeological Project, consisting offederally owned lands at
Wister Lake administered by the Tulsa District, was placed on the NRHP. Eighteen

prehistoric sites were identified as contributing elements ofthis NRHP district. The exact
acreage incorporated by the Wister Lake Archaeological District is not known, but the
USACE, Tulsa District, office is currently in the process of expanding the archeological
district to encompass the entire Wister Lake project area. Thus, all the land owned by the
federal government at Wister Lake should be considered part ofthe future archeological
district. More recently, Santeford (1984a, I 984b) reported on excavations at the PeeWee
(34LF292) and Wilber Waits (34LF277) sites. A large number of cultural resources
management projects related to highway or road construction, watershed surveys
(impoundment and erosion control measures), and predisturbance planning for natural gas
pipelines and seismic lines have been carried out by various private archeological contract
firms (some of these reports are referenced in Table 1). General overviews of Wister Lake
culture history are provided by Galm (1984), Klinger and Cande (1987), and Vehik
(1988).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Wister Lake lies on the interface between Oklahoma's Prairie Plains and Ouachita
Mountains, both of which are subdivisions of the Interior Plains of the Central Lowlands
province (Morris et al. 1986). The USACE defines the region as part ofthe Ozark
Mountain-Arkansas River-Ouachita Mountain (OAO) subregion of its Southwest Division
(Sabo et al. 1990). Based on previous archeological investigations conducted in the
project area (Bell 1984a, 1984b; Bell and Baerreis 1951; Guilinger 1971; Howard 1941;
Lawton 1960; Newkumet 1940a, 1940b, 1940c, 1940d, 1940e, 1940f; Proctor 1957; Sabo
et al. 1990; Sharrock 1960), it is known that humans have continuously occupied eastcentral Oklahoma since the end of the Pleistocene epoch (ca. 12,000 yrs BP). Cultural
history for this portion of eastern Oklahoma can be subdivided into five broad temporal
periods. Although different tenns are used by different researchers, the purposes of this
report will be served by the following: Paleo-Indian (12,000-8,000 yr BP), Archaic
(8,000-2,300 yrs BP), Woodland (2,300-1,200 yrs BP); Arkansas Valley Caddoan (1,100400 yrs BP), and Historic (400 yrs BP - present). A generalized cultural chronology for
the region is summarized in Table 2 and detailed in the section below. This summary is
based primarily upon Bell (1984a), Morris et al. (1986), and Sabo et al. (1990), although
other sources have been consulted.

1 Culture group/complexes within each period are defined by distinctive artifacts.
Within the Paleo-Indian and Archaic periods, most of the culture group/complexes are
defined by characteristic spear points. Within the Woodland and Caddoan periods,
characteristic ceramic types playa more important role in the identification of culture
group/complexes. Historic culture group/complexes are identified through diagnostic
artifacts as well as documentary evidence, such as deed records and written accounts.

Paleo-Indian Period - 12,000-8,000 yr BP
The first definitive evidence ofhurnan occupation in eastern Oklahoma dates from
the Paleo-Indian period, beginning approximately 12,000 years ago. This period
represents the first colonization ofthe North American continent by humans and their
initial cultural diversification as the glacial Pleistocene epoch gave way to the more
modem conditions of the Holocene. The ancestors of the Paleo-Indians appear to have
been specialized big-game hunters who entered North America from Siberia via the Bering
Land Bridge, near the end of the Wisconsin Glacial period. Given the absence of other
humans and the abundance of now-extinct forms of Pleistocene megafauna (e.g.,
mammoths, mastodons, giant bison, and horse), these pioneers spread rapidly across the
virgin continent. Their preserved material remains indicate that these early Paleo-Indians
functioned primarily as highly mobile hunters of the megafauna (Broilo 1971; Meltzer
1986); however, this interpretation may simply reflect the greater visibility and
preservation of megafaunaI kill sites. Paleo-Indian groups most likely took the form of
single family micro-bands, numbering fewer than 20 individuals. They are best known for
their fluted and basally thinned projectile points, although other lithic tools, such as bifacial
knives, drills, gravers, burins, flake cores, scrapers, and flake tools, were also included in
their tool kits (Frison 1978). Well-made bone tools, including points, awls, needles, and

other tool forms, are also known from Paleo-Indian assemblages (e.g., Frison and Zeimans
1980).
Three widespread Paleo-Indian cultural complexes are generally accepted for
central North America: the Clovis complex, the Folsom complex (also known as the
Lindenmeir complex after the type site in Colorado), and the later Plano complex. Among
the numerous Plano cultures which might have occupied the area arc Agate Basin,
Plainview, Scottsbluff, Dalton, Meserve, Milnesand, and Frederick (Gettys 1984; Sabo et
al. 1990). Paleo-Indian cultures tend to be extremely widespread; variants of the Clovis
culture, for example, appear throughout the North American continent, while Folsom is
limited to the Great Plains region, which stretches from Canada to South Texas.
The earliest cultural remains known for Oklahoma belong to the Clovis culture
(12,000-11,000 yr BP). The Clovis culture is marked by basally tluted Clovis projectile
points, which are often found in association with mammoth and other megafaunal remains.
Although no such contexts have been found in eastern Oklahoma, Clovis finds have been
found in association with mammoth remains at the Domebo site in southwest Oklahoma's
Caddo County. This find has been conclusively dated to about 11,150 yr BP (Leonhardy
1966). Occasionally, isolated Clovis points are collected from surface contexts within the
project area.
By 11,000 yr BP, the High Plains variant of the Clovis complex had evolved into
the Folsom culture (Judge 1973). By that time most ofthe Pleistocene megafauna were
extinct in North America (possibly due to overhunting and other factors; Martin 1967),
and Folsom hunters were forced to select smaller forms of bison as their prey species of
choice. Diagnostic Folsom artifacts include a distinctive variety oftluted projectile points,
often in association with bison kills; fine bone tools, including projectile points, are also
known for the Folsom complex (Frison and Zeimans 1980). Most Folsom kills are
associated with extinct forms of bison, including Bison antiquus and B. latifrons (Frison
1978). Hofinan (1986) has documented numerous Folsom finds throughout Oklahoma;
most fall within the western portion ofthe state in the High Plains, but a few finds have
been made in the eastern portion of the state as well. Better-known Folsom sites, with
materials in subsurface contexts, occur further west in Texas and New Mexico.
Blackwater Draw, Lubbock Lake, Lake Theo, and Lipscomb are among the better known
Folsom localities (Largent et al. 1991).
The Plano complex sites are characterized by untluted lanceolate projectile point
styles. Cultures which may have occupied or visited the Lake Wister region include Agate
Basin, Plainview, Scottsbluff, Dalton, Meserve, Milnesand, and Frederick. Plano-age kill
sites typically contain modem faunal remains (particularly bison), indicating the presence
of an environment largely identical to today's. Most Plano localities known for eastern
Oklahoma consist of surface finds and unexcavated contexts (e.g., Bell 1977). However,
large numbers of Dalton points have been collected by relic hunters on and near Lake
Eufaula, about 80 krn west of the project area (Perino and Caffey 1980).

Archaic Period (8,000-2,300 yr BP)
As big game became increasingly scarce at the end of the Pleistocene, subsistence
strategies shifted toward lifeways less dependent on large game for survival, and the
Paleo-Indian peoples began to diversifY into a series of regional cultures that have
collectively come to be known as "Archaic." The Archaic was a period of increasing
sedentism and population growth, with associated social differentiation.
TheArchaic adaptative pattern in eastern Oklahoma was similar to that ofthe
eastern United States (perino and Caffey 1980; Wyckoff and Brooks 1983). However,
the distinctions between Early, Middle, and Late Archaic phases are still poorly
understood for Oklahoma. The Early Archaic lasted from approximately 8,000-7,000 yrs
BP, and possibly slightly later. Relative intra-component homogeneity of point styles
make Early Archaic assemblages distinctive. Serrations on larger points, base and stem
grinding, and beveling ofthe blade occur more frequently than in earlier and later
assemblages. Also found in these assemblages are early forms of grinding stones, which
are smaller than those oflater periods and shaped exclusively through wear. One Early
Archaic culture defined for eastern Oklahoma is the Packard complex, which may actually
be Paleo-Indian, based on one radiocarbon date (about 9,400 yr BP) and some
technological attributes (Wyckoff 1984). Indeed, Sabo et al. (1990) place it within their
Dalton period, a transitional period occurring between the Paleo-Indian and Archaic
periods at about 10,500-9,500 yr BP. For the purposes ofthis document, the Dalton
phase (Sabo et al. 1990) has been subsumed within the Paleo-Indian period.
The Middle Archaic period (7,000-3,500 yr BP) in general is characterized as a
period of warm, dry conditions throughout eastern Oklahoma (Wyckoff 1984). Grassland
species such as pronghorn antelope and bison became more common in the region. Few
sites are known for this period, but those that have been adequately dated have yielded
artifact assemblages similar to those reported for Texas and other surrounding states. In
Texas at least, this was a period of increasing regional population density (Weir 1976).
Middle Archaic cultures known for eastern Oklahoma include the Tom's Brook culture
(Schambach 1970; Wyckoff 1984), which is marked by a variety of dart point styles,
including Johnson, Fairland, Big Sandy, Ensor, Frio, Duncan, Castroville, and Marcos.
Nutting and grinding stones are also found in Tom's Brook assemblages. This culture has
been roughly dated to between 6,000 and 5,000 yr BP. Later cultural remains, ascribed by
Wyckoff (1984) to the Caudill complex, are sometimes found overlying Tom's Brook
components. Typical Caudill remains include red ochre, grinding stones and cup stones,
and finely made chipped-stone projectile points including Hidden Valley, Table Rock, Calf
Creek, Bulverde, and Smith styles. Finally, a few cultural finds ascribable to the northeast
Texas MiddlelLate Archaic Trinity Aspect have been recorded in this region. This cultural
period is marked by Carollton, Bulverde, Wells, and Morhiss dart point styles. Finds in
Texas suggest the Trinity Aspect occurred from about 4,000-1,500 yr BP, although recent
finds indicate an earlier starting date (Wyckoff 1984).

The Late Archaic was characterized by a greater intra-component tool diversity
than earlier assemblages. Point styles underwent significant temporal changes. Expanding
stemmed points occurred with greater frequency at the beginning of the Late Archaic but
gradually became less common, whereas the number of contracting stem points such as
Gary increased. The presence of concave bases on a number of point forms also appears
to be diagnostic of the Late Archaic in the region (Cheek 1977). Wyckoff(1984)
describes two Late Archaic cultures for eastern Oklahoma: the Lawrence phase ofthe
northeast Oklahoma Ozarks and the Wister phase which occurs farther south in the
Ouachita Mountains area. Lawrence phase assemblages, which date from 3,500-2,700 yr
BP, are characterized by small comer notched points (possibly indicating the adoption of
the bow and arrow at the end of the Late Archaic) and larger dart point styles such as
Snyders, Table Rock stemmed, Marshall, Williams, and Afton.
During the Late Archaic period, extensive use was made of riparian environments,
and the large number of site components attributable to this cultural period suggests that
population densities may have been larger than during the preceding Middle Archaic
period. Late Archaic components are commonly the lowermost levels of earth middens
and mound sites (Gabn 1978a, 1978b). In the Arkansas River valley area, Late Archaic
components are grouped under a single phase designation, the Wister phase (Bell 1980).
The Wister phase (3,500-2,300 yr BP) designates a pre-pottery hunter/gatherer society
whose assemblages include finely worked bone tools (including hooks, bone handles, awls,
and flakers); decorated beads made from stone, hackberry seeds, snail shells, and other
materials; and grinding and nutting stones. Contracting stemmed projectile point forms,
prirnarily Gary, co-occur with various expanding stemmed/comer notched styles, including
finely crafted Sununerfield, Marshall, Marcos, and Pahnillas dart points. Many ofthe
artifact styles and technologies that appear during the Late Archaic persisted as dominant
forms well beyond the end ofthe Wister phase. Chipped stone technology, together with
patterns of raw material procurement, do not appear to change very much until well into
the Caddoan period. Further, Wyckoff (1984) suggests that Wister phase peoples may
have maintained a trading relationship with the Poverty Point culture of northwestern
Louisiana, as evidenced by the presence of nonlocal raw materials and finished goods such
as Lake Superior copper and marine shell from the Gulf Coast.
Burials represent the most common type offeature recorded in Wister phase
components (Gabn 1984). Other features associated with residential occupations,
including pits, ashy concentrations, and rock concentrations, are present on some sites as
well, but they are generally not very well preserved, nor are they very informative.
Subsistence strategies during the Wister phase were focused on nut collecting
(prirnarily Carya), deer and small game hunting, and harvesting aquatic resources, such as
fish, turtles, and freshwater mussels. This pattern of resource exploitation exhibits a
remarkable stability throughout the subsequent prehistoric sequence, representing a
consistent use of riparian, forest-edge, and aquatic habitats. This pattern changes
dramatically only with the introduction of agriculture during the Caddoan period. Gabn
(1984) has argued that most Wister phase sites were occupied on a year-round basis, or at

least for several seasons of the year. As such, he characterizes Wister phase settlements as
permanent or semi-permanent base camps that are distributed across the landscape in
locations offering access to each of the habitats exploited. This characterization is
supported by the "diversity of implement forms, the quantities of floral and faunal remains
represented, and the intensity of occupations reflected in the depositional records at
multicomponent sites" (Galm 1984:213).

It has been well documented that this vibrant Wister culture, which occupied a
series of sites centered around the Fourche Maline Creek drainage in the Ouachita
Mountains, was directly ancestral to the later Fourche Maline Woodland culture (Bell
1980; Sabo et al. 1990; Wyckoff 1984).
Woodland Period (2,300-1,200 yrs BP)
Referred to as both Post-Archaic or Pre-Caddoan, the Woodland period is the
least well-known chronological period for eastern Oklahoma, for the change from Archaic
to Woodland is one of degree and not of kind. The Woodland adaptation is characterized
by the addition of pottery to otherwise Archaic material assemblages; later innovations
included the bow and arrow, as evidenced by the appearance of smaller projectile point
styles late in the sequence. This period also included expansion ofthe subsistence base,
which now included limited horticulture.
In eastern Oklahoma the Woodland period is antecedent to, and provided the
basis for, the flourishing Mississippian-related Caddoan culture. Cultural regionalism
between the northern and southern part of northeast Oklahoma is evident during this
period. Whereas both populations were involved in horticulture, their pottery was of
different forms. The Woodland manifestation in the north is similar to ''Hopewellian''
material in the Kansas City region. Snyder points, circular scrapers, and grit-tempered
pottery characterize this period in the region (USACE 1982). Pottery is either plain or
decorated. Decoration styles include cord-wrapped-stick impressions, dentate
impressions, embossed nodes, incising, and punctations placed mainly in zones.
Several stratified sites dating to the ArchaicIWoodland transition have been
recorded along Fourche Maline Creek in LeFlore County; these are the type sites for the
Fourche Maline Woodland culture. Wister Lake, which was created by the damming of
Fourche Maline Creek and the Poteau River, lies in the center of the Fourche Maline
cultural area; many of the Fourche Maline type sites lie within the conservation pool of the
lake, and were included as part of the current project. Fourche Maline culture is heir to
the previous Wister phase of the Late Archaic; indeed, Galm (1982, 1984) defines both the
Wister and Fourche Maline phases as "Arkansas Valley Caddoan Formative," implying a
transitional cultural period overlapping the Archaic and Woodland periods, although he
recognizes Fourche Maline as part of the Southern Woodland tradition. As such, it is the
only Woodland tradition strongly expressed in this part ofthe state.

Archeological evidence indicates that the Fourche Maline culture was, with a few
exceptions, nearly identical to the ancestral Wister culture (GaIm 1981, 1982). Fourche
Maline subsistence continued to be based on hunting and gathering, although apparently
some limited horticulture was practiced. Fourche Maline material assemblages include the
area's first ceramics, particularly grog, grit, and bone-tempered styles such as Williams
Plain and LeFlore Plain; these "increase in frequency during later segments of the phase"
(GaIm 1984). Some styles are crudely decorated with incised lines and cross-hatching,
and basketry impressions at the bases of some vessels indicate that the clay was formed
around woven baskets. Sherds with a high proportion of bone tempering occur in the
earliest samples of Williams Plain as a minor variant, and the frequency of bone tempering
increases throughout the Fourche Maline phase. Chipped stone artifacts include Gary dart
points, as well as double-bitted axes. Toward the end of the phase small numbers of
arrow points (such as Massard, Scallorn, and Hayes styles) appear in assemblages,
indicating the late adoption of the bow and arrow.

In essence, the appearance of pottery is the sole defining characteristic that marks
the transition from Late Archaic to Woodland period occupations in this area (GaIm
1984). Many Fourche Maline phase occupations overlie earlier Wister phase components,
indicating that sites were reoccupied throughout the transitionary period. Artifact
assemblages and subsistence strategies exhibit only subtle changes over the transition, and
occupational features in Fourche Maline occupations parallel those documented in Wister
phase components. Two notable changes did, however, accompany the Archaic to
Woodland transition. Fourche Maline components tend to be fewer in number and
thinner than Wister phase deposits, suggesting changes in settlement patterns that have so
far defied explanation. Also, expanding stemmed/corner notched projectile points (or
knives) are less common.in ceramic-bearing Fourche Maline deposits.
Arkansas Valley Caddoan Tradition (1,200 to 400 yr BP)
After 1,200 yr BP (A.D. 800), the Wister Lake area supported cultures belonging
to the Arkansas Valley Caddoan Tradition, a localized expression of the widespread
Mississippian culture which then dominated the central portion of North America. These
cultures were apparently descended (at least in part) from the preceding Wister and
Fourche Maline complexes. Various conflicting classifications for the cultures in this area
make understanding and interpreting the local chronology rather difficult. However,
recent attempts to rectifY these differences (as well as the passing ofthe cumbersome
Midwest Taxonomic System) have clarified the situation somewhat. Three Arkansas
Valley Caddoan cultures are now generally recognized for the Lake Eufaula area: the
Harlan phase (approximately 1,200-800 yr BP), the Spiro phase (800-550 yr BP), and the
Fort Coffee phase (550-400 yr BP).
Harlan Phase
The earliest east-central Oklahoma Caddoan populations, belonging to the Harlan
phase, appear to be direct descendants of the antecedent Fourche Maline culture. This

widespread cultural manifestation was centered along the Arkansas River and its
tributaries, extending west into the Lake Eufaula area, east into present-day Missouri,
north to the Oklahoma border, and south ahnost to the Kiamichi River. A few western
settlements apparently represent attempts to colonize the Prairie-Plains region west of
Lake Eufaula (Bell 1984b). Harlan phase represents the first appearance of mounds in the
Wister Lake area; both mounds and habitation sites without mounds have been found
dating to this period. Mound sites may consist of one or more mounds; multiple mounds
are often oriented around a central plaza. Mounds are of two types, conical and platform.
Examples of the former style, sometimes conjoined, were used for burials and the latter
usually served as supports for structures. Significant Harlan phase mound sites include the
type site, Harlan Mounds, on Lake Gibson near Tahlequah; Spiro Mounds in nearby
Sequoyah County; and Eufaula (or Groseclose) Mound, the only known Harlan phase site
in the Canadian River drainage (Bell 1984b; Sabo et al. 1990).
Moundless habitation sites typically take the form of small villages, base camps,
farmsteads, and specialized activity areas. Archeological evidence clearly illustrates that
Harlan phase houses were square, pOle-framed wattle-and-daub structures with extended
entryways, interior hearths, and interior roof supports, measuring approximately 7 m
across. Harlan phase subsistence was based on agriculture and the exploitation of wild
floral and faunal resources. Cultural assemblages include a wide variety of clay, grog, and
shell-tempered ceramics; vessel forms included bottles and carinated bowls. Williams and
Le Flore Plain still dominated, although other styles such as Beaver Pitiched, Davis
Incised, Pennington Punctate Incised, and Spiro Engraved were also used. Exotic styles,
such as Coles Creek from Louisiana and Mississippi, were also found. Decoration
includes incising, engraving, punctating, and pinching.
Lithic artifacts include numerous side- and comer-notched projectile points of
common styles such as Alba, Hayes, Scallorn, Agee, and Sequoyah, as well as a few Ellis,
Gary, Langtry, and Edgewood dart points, which may have been hafted and used as
knives. Chipped-stone hoes, digging tools, and drills are also common, as are celts which
were roughed out by chipping and later polished into final form. Other lithic forms include
milling stones, anvil stones, nutting stones, beads, earspools, and pipes. Many of these
tool forms were directly adapted to the agricultural lifestyle. Bone artifucts are rare in
Harlan assemblages, but include fishhooks, awls, beads, pins, and sickles. Wood was used
for earspooIs, hairpins, and beads (Bell 1984b). Exotic materials, including some ceramic
styles, copper (used for veneer on wood objects and as ornaments), galena crystals, conch
shell, and some lithic materials (Alibates agatized dolomite, Arkansas novaculite, and Kay
County chert for example) indicate the presence ofa vigorous and widespread trading
network (Bell 1984b; Sabo et al. 1990).
Spiro Focus
The Harlan phase was succeeded by the more sophisticated Spiro phase.
According to Brown (1984), Spiro "represents the Caddoan tradition in the Arkansas
Valley drainage at the peak of social complexity and cultural elaboration." This period

witnessed a crystallization of cultural trends, manifested as the greatest florescence of a
regional trade network. As with the Harlan phase, Spiro culture is centered around the
Arkansas River valley, although it exhibits a slightly smaller areal extent. The most
heavily occupied area is the Arkoma basin, the physiography of which is characterized by
butte and valley terrain. Given the high profile of the Spiro Mounds site and the artistic
value of Spiro phase artifacts, this is undoubtedly the best known prehistoric culture of
Oklahoma.
Brown (1984) defines three types of settlements: civic-ceremonial centers, villages,
and temporary, special-activity camps. The civic-ceremonial centers were apparently
shared by several discrete villages located in the surrounding area and typically consisted
of public buildings in association with a buried structure mound or platform mound. Not
surprisingly, the Spiro Mounds site is one of the best examples ofthe civic-ceremonial site
for the Spiro phase (Brown 1966; please note that other cultures, including the preceding
Harlan phase, also occupied the site). Spiro Mounds probably represents the rruUor center
of the Spiro culture, given the large munber of Spiro phase sites in the vicinity. Other
important Spiro phase sites include the associated Cavanaugh and Skidgel mound
complexes in Arkansas and the Norman site near Norman, Oklahoma.
Spiro phase villages consisted of collections of structures greatly resembling those
used by their Harlan predecessors. The structures were square to rectangular, gabled-pole
wattle-and-daub buildiIigs apparently thatched with grass. Common buildings were larger
and more solidly build; most exhibit evidence oflarge central supports. Smaller,
specialized activity sites include mines, quarries, and food extraction camps.
Spiro phase subsistence was based on agriculture, supplemented by hunting and
gathering. Among the cultigens grown were maize, beans, squash, sunf1ower, and gourd;
other species which might have been cultivated include Chenopodium (goosefoot) and
amaranth. Cultural assemblages include a wide variety of materials, given the excellent
preservation at many Spiro sites. Among the native materials utilized were stone, ochre,
shell, bone, antler, anirnal hair, feathers, wood, grasses, and clay; these were used to
fashion chipped and ground stone tools and ornaments, pigments, shell, bone and antler
tools and ornaments, textiles, wooden tools and ornaments (commonly as a base for
copper sheeting), basketry, and baked clay and ceramic goods. Exotic materials included
some lithic materials, projectile points, pigments, ceramics, ornaments, and copper; most
of these were used for decorative purposes (Brown 1984).
Ceramic styles were many and varied. Pottery vessel shapes illcluded seed jars,
bowls, footed vessels, jars, bottles, and beakers, some of which appear to have been
fashioned around basketry "molds." Decorative techniques included punctating, incising,
and engraving; some vessels were burnished and decorated with a red or black slip.
Among the recognized local pottery styles are Woodward Applique, Braden Punctate,
Poteau Engraved, and Spiro Engraved. Trade wares are also common in Spiro
assemblages, especially those from the Red River to the south, and include Sanders Plain,
Haley Engraved, and Maxey Noded Redware (Brown 1984; Sabo et al. 1990).

Chipped stone technology included a wide variety of tools, such as axes, siltstone
hoes, spade heads, drills, choppers, and projectile points. Most recovered projectile points
belong to small triangular and notch-based arrow point styles, such as Washita, Fresno,
Morris, and Keota; however, Gary dart points (which apparently were actually used as
knives) remain common, and some triangular lance points have been recovered. Ground
stone technology is represented by stone pipes, manos and metates, adzes, celts, hones,
files, and abraders made of sandstone (Sabo et al. 1990).
Fort Coffee Phase
By about 500 years ago, the Spiro culture was followed by the Fort Coffee phase,
as the Wister Lake area's inunediate pre-Contact culture is kno~ (Bell 1984a;
Rohrbaugh 1984; Sabo et al. 1990). Continuity in material culture is evident at Fort
Coffee phase sites in the valleys of the Arkansas and Grand rivers. During this period
there was a marked concentration of village sites east of the CanadianlIllinoislArkansas
confluence and an increased Plains influence on the local Caddoan culture. Village sites
from this period have yielded increased amounts ofunworked bison bone, an indication
that Plains bison hunting increased during this time. In short, this society was less
complex and sophisticated than the Spiro phase. In the words ofSabo et al. (1990): "The
elaborate sumptuary and ceremonial artifacts associated with the preceding phase are
largely absent, as is evidence of extended long distance trade with eastern cultures. . .. In
general, the Fort Coffee phase represents a society lacking the strong social hierarchy and
associated ritual activity of the Spiro phase."
.
The Fort Coffee phase is best represented by small settlement and cemetery sites,
although other site types, including specialized camps, are known. For example, the Goff
rockshelter, on the edge of the prairie uplands to the west of the Arkansas River valley,
evidently functioned primarily as a hunting camp. Among the best known Fort Coffee
phase sites are Tyler, Tyler-Rose, and Robinson-Solesbee, all of which are clustered south
of the Arkansas near Spiro. All consist of small hamlets or villages; no known Fort Coffee
sites approach the size and complexity of many Spiro phase sites, indicating a
deflorescence of the Caddom culture in this area. Although the cause for this cultural
"downsizing" remains uncertain, it may be related to the onset ofthe so-called "Little Ice
Age," or Neo-Boreal period (approximately A.D. 1400 -1850), a recent climatic mininllun
during which cooler, moister conditions prevailed (Leet and Judson 1965; Sabo et al.
1990: Table 8). This period may have limited the viability of Caddoan agricultural
techniques and may well have decreased the overall biomass available for exploitation,
thus limiting populations and village size. Certainly, this may have been a stimulus for
their increased dependence on bison hunting, as observed at Tyler, Tyler-Rose, and other
sites. Conversely, Sabo et al. (1990) suggest that the change in subsistence practices may
have been caused by the migration of bison populations to the east, causing a sudden
increase in their availability which led to bison hunting as a major resource.

Fort Coffee phase structures were usually have a rectangular plan with two large
center posts, a style held over from the Spiro phase (Rohrbaugh 1984), although circular
houses have been recorded for the Sheffield and Choates-Holt sites (to the northwest and
immediately south of Spiro, respectively; Sabo et al. 1990). Most are found in association
with large burial pits. Fort Coffee phase cemeteries vary in size but tend to be small;
however, larger Fort Coffee cemeteries are known, as exemplified by the Lyman Moore
cemetery near Spiro (Rohrbaugh 1984; Sabo et al. 1990). Burials are often semiflexed
and include distinctive tool kits, especially in graves offemales (Rohrbaugh 1984).
Fort Coffee phase subsistence was based on limited cultivation of com (and
perhaps of sunflower and squash), as well as a heavy dependence on the meat of bison and
white-tailed deer. Other animals, including duck, turkey, quail, passenger pigeon, bear,
beaver, and woodchuck, have also been reported for Fort Coffee sites. Cultural
assemblages include a distinctive series of decorated, shell-tempered ceramic types
(Woodland Plain, Avery Engraved, Avery Punctated, and Nash Neck-Banded are common
styles), as well as small triangular arrow points belonging to styles such as Fresno, Talco,
and Shetley. Some ground stone artifacts are present in the assemblages, as are bison and
deer bone tools-awls, sickles, hoes, and digging tools. Limited amounts of utilized shell
are also known for Fort Coffee assemblages (Rohrbaugh 1984; Sabo et al. 1990).
Historic Period (A.D. 1600 - present)
Although the local Native American cultures were apparently already in decline by
the time Euro-Americans and their diseases entered the project area in force, the Contact
period was as devastating for the Native Americans here as it was elsewhere. Aside from
the inevitable loss of life due to diseases to which Native American populations had little
or no natural immunity, epidemics caused native populations to miss or skip significant
portions of their annual subsistence cycles, resulting in further weakness and deaths when
new diseases arrived. Political, spiritual, and medicinal leaders were often killed by
diseases over which their healing practices had little to no control; this resulted in further
cultural and spiritual disruption (e.g., Cronon 1983). Numerous settlements were either
depopulated by disease or were abandoned by survivors in an attempt to outrun a disease.
Surviving populations were often forced to consolidate for their own survival, sometimes
resulting in new rounds of epidemics.
Although the research is incomplete at this time, European contact in the project
area may have begun as early as 1539-1543, when the Spanish de Soto expedition passed
through or near the area. Whatever the case, de Soto's entrada apparently did not
significantly affect the native cultures. By A.D. 1600,the research area functioned as a
hunting ground for a number of Native American groups, primarily the Caddo and the
Wichita. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, French fur traders had reached the
area; records show that Sieur de La Harpe passed through the area in 1719. La Salle
explored part of the Mississippi Valley in 1782, later claiming the entire Mississippi
drainage system for the French Crown (Good 1980). Although territorial claims shifted
between the French and Spanish during the succeeding years, Frenchmen controlled the

land until it was acquired by the United States in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. During
this period, commercial settlements such as Chouteau flourished along the Grand, Illinois,
and Arkansas rivers. The French traded with both the Indians and the Spaniards in Texas
and New Mexico, and according to Morris et al. (1986), "The French Governor of
Louisiana, Kerleric, regarded the Caddoan and other tribes of the area as subjects of
France." One of the more important early French visits to Oklahoma was the Mallet
expedition, led by Canadian voyageurs Paul and Pierre Mallet in 1739. They followed the
South Canadian River west from Illinois, sometimes on foot and sometimes by canoe;
where it split into its North and South forks north of the project area, they continued
along the South Fork. Eventually they reached Santa Fe, where they illicitly and profitably
traded with the Spaniards there. The Mallets and others also passed through the project
area with Andre Fabry de la Bruyere in 1741, during the course of an expedition to
investigate the viability of the Canadian as a trade route between the Louisiana territory
and the Spanish Southwest (Good 1980).
France held title to the project area, and a vast area surrounding it, until 1803.
However, after sustaining heavy casualties at Santa Domingo in the West Indies,
Napoleon was forced to give up his quest to dominate the New World. He thereafter sold
all French claims in North America to the United States in order to acquire funds for
military actions nearer to home. This deal, negotiated as the Louisiana Purchase, was a
boon to the United States. In one fell swoop the new republic more than doubled the
territory it controlled. The territory acquired was so vast that Thomas Jefferson made the
prediction that it could not be completely colonized and developed prior to the year A.D.
2600; he failed to consider manifest destiny, population pressures, technological
developments, and the sheer land hunger ofthe expanding American populace. A number
of exploratory quests of the new lands were quickly undertaken by such figures as Lewis
and Clark, Zebulon Pike, Major Stephen Long, and Thomas James. James' 1821
expedition followed the course ofthe Arkansas. In contrast, Long's 182 L return from the
Rocky Mountains followed the course of the South Canadian River, passing north ofthe
project area (Morris et al. 1986; Sabo et al. 1990).
At first, many Euro-Americans were unwilling to settle Oklahoma, due to its
reputation as part of the "Great American Desert," a sobriquet bequeathed by early
explorers (including Major Long). Because the general consensus was that the lands were
marginal at best, it was considered by the U.S. government to be an ideal place to relocate
the thousands of surviving Native Americans who had been displaced by advancing EuroAmerican settlement. Entire tribes were either removed voluntarily or corralled and forcemarched to the new Indian Territory. For various perspectives on this process, Van Every
(1966), DeRosier (1970), Brown (1971), Jennings (1975), and Green (1982).
For the Wister Lake area, the years between 1820 and 1850 were marked by the
influx and resettlement of the Five Civilized Tribes--Cherokee, Creek, Seminole,
Choctaw, and Chickasaw-from the southern states. The Creek and Seminole relocated
to the area north ofthe Canadian River in present-day McIntosh County. The Choctaw
and the Chickasaw settled south of the Canadian. The Cherokee settled in lands to the

north of the Canadian, but east ofthe Creek/Seminole area. The Choctaw/Chickasaw
settlement area was later further subdivided into the Chickasaw and Choctaw nations, with
the latter on the eastern border ofIndian Territory, inunediately south of the Cherokee
Nation. The project area is within the east-central portion of the Choctaw Nation, perhaps
80 km south of the Cherokee border.
Although the area was nominally Indian territory, Euro-American encroachments
were common. Military expeditions led by Fort Gibson's Captain B.L.E. Boonville and
others ranged through the area in 1830, and by 1839, Josiah Gregg's overland route to
Santa Fe had been established along the divide between the North and South branches of
the Canadian. This route was later used extensively by prospectors heading for the
California gold mines. In 1843, Nathan Boone (a son of Daniel Boone) left Fort Gibson
with a company of dragoons and ventured west in order to "make a reconnaissance of the
Western prairie." Aside from Gregg's overland route to California, other immigrant roads
also passed through or near the project area; one ofthese was the Texas Road. This
byway was established at Fort Gibson prior to 1842; the southern section, which crossed
Pittsburg and McIntosh counties, was routed in 1842. According to Good, the Texas
Road" ... carried more traffic than any other in Indian Territory until after the Civil War.
This was the frrst land route to appear on maps of what is now Oklahoma. Trade,
industry, and settlement followed its course" (Good 1980).
Fort Smith, on the nearby Arkansas River, was soon forced into a role as protector
ofthe western immigrants along the new trails. Eventually, the War Department
authorized Fort Smith to find and develop a new westerly route south of the Canadian
River. Captain Randolph Marcy was detached for this task. As a result ofhis
explorations throughout the area, Marcy "gave names to more streams and other physical
features in the area now Oklahoma than any other individual" (Good 1980). Marcy
passed through the project area at least once during the course of his investigations.
Eventually, the trail chosen by Marcy became known as the California Road. Parts of this
trail are now inundated by the southern extension of Lake Eufaula.
Euro-American exploration of the area continued apace, as the Indians attempted
to accommodate them and continued to pursue their own interests. The Army tramped
through the area at will; emigrants passed through on their way to Califurnia, gold, and
glory; and missionaries were sent into the Indian nations to help them find the JudeoChristian God. Eventually, the whites began to covet the Indian lands again. The Indians,
however, managed to hold onto their parcels until after the Civil War.
The Civil War (1861-1865) was as traumatic for the Native Americans in
Oklahoma as it was for the Euro-Americans. The Indian Territory was of strategic
importance, acting as a buffer between Confederate Texas and Union Kansas, and as such
was courted by both governments. Both sides found adherents in the territory. The Five
Civilized Tribes in Indian Territory fractured along old sectional lines. The Choctaw and
Chickasaw went almost as a group with the South. The other tribes, however, were
painfully divided, with some joining each side. For example, the Lower Creek joined with

the South, and their cousins, the Upper Creek, fought for the North (Wright 1951).
Interestingly, those members of the tribes with some Euro-American heritage often went
with the South, while full-bloods remained loyal to the Union that had so mistreated them;
such it was with the Cherokee and Seminole (Abel 1919; Good 1980; Rampp and Rampp
1975). Soldiers from the Five Tribes fought with valor on both sides ofthe struggle, and
one, Cherokee General Stand Watie, bears the double distinction of being the first Native
American to attain the rank of general in the American army, as well as the last
Confederate general officer to surrender his command. He surrendered at Doaksville in
the Choctaw Nation on June 23, 1865, more than two months after the end ofthe war
(Cunningham 1959; Rampp and Rampp 1975; Wright 1951). After the Civil War, the
Native American groups reverted to reservation territories under the control of tribal
councils. Those that had slaves were forced to release them. Many freedmen stayed in
the area.
Oklahoma, including both the Euro-American settlements and the Indian nations,
was gradually assimilated into the developing Midwest throughout the remainder of the
nineteenth century. Small industries, such as grist mills, cotton gins, and ferries, appeared
in the area, and religious missions were common. The railroad arrived in the early 1870s,
spelling the end oflocal wagon trails such as the California and Texas roads. In
conjunction with the development of the railroads, coal mining began in the Choctaw
Nation. Both industries were economic boons for the area; however, both served to
further Americanize the Indians and to solidifY the whites' control of the area. Significant
white immigration, in the form offoreign workers, began in the Wister Lake area at that
time. The coal mines needed miners and the Choctaw Nation could provide none due to
lack of training and inclination. Among the nationalities represented by the miners were
American, English, Irish, Italian, Scottish, Welsh, Lithuanian, French, and Mexican. By
1876 several railroads, including the local Missouri, Kansas, and Texas lines, were
exclusively utilizing Choctaw coal (Good, 1980). In 1903, the workers began to
unionize.
By the late nineteenth century, numerous whites had settled throughout the
vicinity; in the census of 1890 more than 28,000 whites lived in the Choctaw Nation, as
opposed to only 11,000 Indians and 4,400 African-Americans. In the Creek Nation,
Indians and African-Americans outnumbered whites, with populations of 10,000 and
4,600, respectively, to the whites' 3,300 (Good 1980). In 1889, the federal government
began letting hordes of impatient white homesteaders into Oklahoma-it was to be the
Indians' refuge from whites no longer. Nearly two milIion acres of ' 'Unassigned Lands"
near the center of the state, lands not assigned to any native group, were opened to white
settlement in 1889. Surplus lands in the adjoining Iowa, Pottawatomie/Shawnee, and Sacand-Fox reservations were opened in 1891; Cheyenne/Arapaho surplus lands to the west
were opened in 1892; and the Cherokee outlet was opened in 1893. The Kickapoo lands
were opened in 1895. All of these territories were opened by land runs, whereby
prospective. settlers raced in and grabbed what they could. Greer County, a large section
in the southwestern part of the state which had been claimed and homesteaded by Texas,
was added to the territory by decree of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1896. Lands owned by

the Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, Wichita, and Caddo were divided by allotment to the
individuals in each tribe, and the remaining lands given to white settlers by lottery from
1901-1902. Between 1904 and 1906, some reservations, such as those belonging to the
Osage, Pawnee, and Tonkawa, were divided into allotments and no white settlers were
allowed. Finally, in 1906, a large area in southwest Oklahoma called Big Pasture was
opened to settlement (Morris et al. 1986). Eventually these areas were organized into
counties.
The eastern third of the state, including the lands ofthe Choctaw, Creek,
Chickasaw, Seminole, and Cherokee nations (as well as a few smaller reservations), was
largely left alone for a time as a separate entity called "Indian Territory," and the rest of
the area was organized as "Oklahoma Territory." In 1893, the U.S. government formed
the Dawes Commission in order to allot the remaining lands of the Five Civilized Tribes;
simultaneously, their native governments were dissolved (Wright 1951 :72-73). During
this period, all common lands in the Indian Territory were adjudicated to individual
members of each tribe.
Early in the twentieth century, a proposal was put forward that the Indian
Territory enter the Union as a separate Indian state called Sequoyah (Morris et al. 1986).
With that purpose specific counties were organized, and the proposal for statehood was
presented before and accepted by the territory's voters. However, the bill proposing this
action failed in Congress, and in 1906 President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Enabling
Act, which combined the "Twin Territories" into a single political district in preparation
for statehood. New counties were organized for Indian Territory, and in November 1907,
Oklahoma entered the Union as the forty-sixth state. The Five Civilized Tribes were
already citizens ofthe United States by that time, based on previous treaty arrangements,
and the surviving Indian nations of eastern Oklahoma were more or less dissolved into the
official federal and state political subdivisions. Ideally, the Indian nations were to retain
their cultural and political integrity; however, in practice the area has long since been
assimilated into the general social fabric of Oklahoma, and whites far outnumber Native
Americans even in areas that were not originally opened to white settlement. While some
community feeling remains, the boundaries of the Indian nations are no longer officially
recognized. Since 1907, the history of eastern Oklahoma and of the Wister Lake area has
largely been the history of the greater United States.
Settlement, agricultural development, and industrial development proceeded
throughout the project area after statehood. More railroads were built, with nearby
McAlester as a secondary hub. Agriculture, in the form of livestock husbandry and the
cultivation of grains, peanuts, and hay, also thrived. Oil and gas, accidentally discovered
near Salina in 1859, began to be sought in the 1890s. The first commercial well was
drilled near Bartlesville in 1896, with the first production of oil (30 barrels) occurring in
1901. Oil development has proceeded apace since then (Morris et al. 1986).
Both agricultural and industrial development stalled in the 1930s with the onset of
the Great Depression. To add climatic insult to economic injury, many farmers in portions

of western Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas were devastated when they learned, the hard
way, that dusty farms turn to dust during dry spells. An extended drought rendered much
of the area barren during the summer of 1933, in what became known as the Dust Bowl:
Rainless weeks were followed by furious, whirling winds, and the sun was
darkened by millions of tons of powdery topsoil eroded from once-fertile areas.
Despondent citizens sat on front porches with protective masks on their faces, watching
their farms swirl by. Some of the dust darkened faraway Boston. Burned and blown out
of the Dust Bowl, tens of thousands of refugees fled their ruined acres [Kennedy and
Bailey 1986].
Fortunately, the Wister Lake area escaped most ofthe ill effects of the Dust Bowl
and survived through the economic woes that followed. World War II, which the United
States entered in 1941, essentially put an end to the last lingering traces of the Great
Depression, and the economy improved afterwards. As of 1980, the population of
Oklahoma was approximately 3,000,000; LeFlore County had a population of 40,698.
Less than eight percent of those counted were Native Americans.
Oklahoma remains a significant agricultural state and is one ofthe major oil and
gas producers in the nation. In 1981 alone, 82,639 oil wells and 16,994 gas wells were in
production in Oklahoma, yielding $9.2 billion worth of petroleum products. The project
area lies beyond the southern margin of the oil and gas production area in Oklahoma,
somewhat south of the giant Red Oak-Norris gas field. As a result the Wister area
produces only a small amount of the annual petroleum harvest. In addition to petroleum
products, coal remains an important resource; estimates suggest that some 3.2 billion tons
remain in the east Oklahoma coal fields, which underlie the project area. Much of the coal
mined in the area is used as an energy source in electrical plants, though some is used in
steel production (Morris et al. 1986).

GEOMORPHOLOGY OF THE POTEAU RIVER
AND FOURCHE MALINE CREEK
M. 1. Guccione

INTRODUCTION
Poteau River basin in east-central Oklahoma preserves abundant archeological
resources, and enjoys the distinction of being the type area for the Late Archaic Wister
culture and the Woodland Fourche Maline culture, which flourished from 3,500 and 2,300
yrs BP and from 2,300 to 1,200 yrs BP, respectively. Dated archeological components
identified in the valleys of the Poteau River and Fourche Maline Creek range in date from
the Middle Archaic to historic periods. No stratified Paleo-Indian sites have been reported
in east-central Oklahoma to date, but surface finds of diagnostic Paleo-Indian projectile
points are not uncommon. The purpose of this study is to assess the potential for locating
preserved, buried archeological sites in the area surrounding the confluence of the Poteau
River and Fourche Maline Creek, to delimit the probability of various geomorphic
landforms for containing either surficial or buried cultural deposits, and, ultimately, to
determine the kinds of site relocation methods necessary in different geomorphic
environments. Documentation of alluvial chronology and processes in the Ouachita
Mountains physiographic province is limited (Bennett et al. 1994; Guccione 1998a;
Madole et al. 1991; Smith 1986), so archeological site potential is difficult to predict
based on other studies in the region. For this reason a transect across both the Poteau and
Fourche Maline valleys was examined using geomorphology, sedimentology, and
pedology to assess the processes and relative chronology of flood plain evolution in the
Wister Lake area. No organic matter suitable for radiocarbon dating was found, so
relative ages of the sediment and landforms were estimated based on the known ages of
archeological sites and the degree of soil development.

GEOLOGY OF REGION
The Ouachita physiographic province of the Interior Highlands is subdivided into
two subprovinces, the Arkansas River valley and the Ouachita Mountains (Madole et al.
1991; Thornbury 1965; Figure 1). The study area is located at the south margin of the
Arkansas River valley, along the frontal thrust belt of the Ouachita Mountains (Miser
1954). Bedrock in both of these physiographic provinces is predominantly Pennsylvanian
sandstone and shale. Within most ofthe Arkansas River valley province, the sandstone
and shale were deposited in a foreland basin, and have been folded and faulted during the
middle and late Pennsylvanian, when collision of two tectonic plates formed the Ouachita
Mountains to the south. These doubly plunging folds form elliptical ridges of more
resistant sandstone beds and intervening valleys ofless resistant shale. South of the study
area, in the frontal thrust belt of the Ouachita Mountains physiographic province,
sandstone and shale also deposited in the foreland basin are present. Apparently, these

thrust-faulted units consist of more massive sequences of sandstone that form large upland
areas with an east-west orientation, but do not include large intervening valleys. A small
amount of limestone, deposited along the shelf edge, may also be present in the frontal
thrust belt.
Streams within the Arkansas River valley physiographic province (Figure 2) exhibit
a trellis drainage pattern which is controlled by the folded, late Paleozoic rocks. Smaller
streams in the Arkansas River valley province are generally confined to bands of shale
outcrop, and flow eastward or westward along the folds and northward around the
margins of plunging folds. Small streams may bisect narrow ridges within a larger fold
and the larger streams may bisect entire folds.
Sediment transported and deposited by streams within both the Arkansas River
valley and the Ouachita Mountains frontal thrust belt is predominantly sandstone.
Although shale and limestone are also present, these materials are not resistant to
weathering and are easily broken into smaller-size fractions or dissolved completely.

METIIODOLOGY
The geomorphic study was conducted using USGS topographic quadrangles, soil
cores, and backhoe trenches. A transect of seven trenches across the Poteau River flood
plain, in an area known locally as the Johnson Bottoms, extended from the south valley
wall to the present channel, which is located adjacent to the north valley wall (Figure 3).
The trenches ranged in depth from 1.7 to 3.7 m and from 8 to 12 m in length, and were
excavated with a O.6-m-wide (24 in) backhoe bucket. For safety reasons, only the upper
portions of each trench were examined in detail. All soils were described using standard
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Survey (USDA, SCS) terminology
(Soil Survey Staff 1981; Appendix A); any cultural material observed in the profile was
noted. Descriptions ofthe material from the base of the deep trenches were made based
on observations of the trench spoil and visual examination ofthe deeper portion ofthe
trenches from the ground surface. The distance between each trench was measured using
a measuring tape, and elevations were extrapolated from the USGS topographic map with
a 6.1-m (20-ft) contour interval.
A transect offive soil cores across the Fourche Maline Valley extended from a
terrace on the south side of the river, across the flood plain, to a terrace ofthe same
altitude along the north valley wall (Figure 4). The 5 cm-diameter (2 in) cores were
extended to core refusa~ at either bedrock or gravel. Core depths ranged from 1.2 to 4.5
m. The distance between each core was measured using a measuring tape and altitudes
were estimated using the topographic map.
Fourteen soil samples obtained from two backhoe trench profiles were analyzed
for grain size by dry sieving the gravel and five sand fractions and by pipette analysis for
one clay and three silt fractions (Day 1965; Appendix B). Both the USDA and Folk

GEOMORPHOLOGY OF THE POTEAU RIVER DRAINAGE BASIN
Poteau River drainage basin encompasses 3,046 lan2 (1,893 mi 2) of west-central
Arkansas and east-central Oklahoma (Figure 2). Two major channels within this drainage
basin, the Poteau River and Fourche Maline Creek, are the focus of this study (Table 2).
The Poteau River originates near Waldron, Arkansas, and flows generally westward along
the strike of the frontal thrust fault ofthe Ouachita Mountains (Miser 1954). Just
upstream of its confluence with Fourche Maline Creek at Wister Lake, the river obliquely
crosses a fold along the southern margin of the Arkansas River valley (Figure 2). The
Fourche Maline Creek originates near Wilburton, Oklahoma, and flows eastward, also
along the strike of the Ouachita Mountain frontal thrust belt. Downstream of their
confluence, the Poteau River flows northward and northeastward around the plunging
limb of folds in the Arkansas River Valley province to its confluence with the Arkansas
River at Fort Smith, Arkansas. Typical of most streams, both the Poteau River and
Fourche Maline Creek have a concave upward longitudinal profile (Figure 5). The Wister
Lake study area is at the confluence of these two drainages, the central valley of the
Poteau River. Here the valley slope is relatively low and approximately half ofthe
drainage basin, I ,598 lan2 (993 mi2 ), is upstream of the study area.
The channels of both the Poteau River and Fourche Maline Creek are straight
(sinuosity < 1.5) along their upstream sections, with sinuousity increasing downstream
(Figure 6). Along its downstream section, Fourche Maline Creek is a meandering stream
(sinuosity> 1.5). In contrast, the sinuosity of the Poteau River varies considerably and
can be characterized as a straight stream and a meandering stream in different areas. With
the steep longitudinal profiles and the low sinuosities, the Poteau River gradients are > I m
lan'! along the upper II percent of both valleys and <I m lan'! along the remainder ofthe
valleys (Figure 7; Table 2), including the portion that passes through the study area. In
the Wister area both Fourche Maline Creek and the Poteau River are fairly typical of this
section ofthe Poteau Valley. Though both streams have slightly lower sinuosities in the
study area compared to that immediately upstream, and therefore slightly higher stream
gradients, this variation may not be significant. The gradient increase may only be an
artifact of the available data because no bathymetric information is available near Wister
Dam and the exact channel length has probably been underestimated.

HYDROLOGY
Discharge of the Poteau River at Wister (downstream of the Fourche Maline
confluence) varied from 0 to 49,400 ft3 sec'! between 1939 and 1949 when Wister Lake
was impounded (USGS 1998). During the II-year period of record, the maximum stage

exceeded 146.3 m (480 ft) in altitude and inundated more land than that of the present
normal lake pool. Therefore, it is likely that even larger floods periodically inundated the
flood plain throughout the Holocene with more than 5.6 m (18.4 ft) of water. However,
the maximum extent of these pre-impoundment floods probably did not cover the terrace
15 m (50 ft) above the flood plain of Fourche Maline Creek. As discussed previously, at
least 10 of the 45 archeological sites included in this study were inundated at the time
relocation efforts were undertaken, as many as four additional sites may have been
inundated, and the remainder have probably been inundated periodically during floods.

POTEAU RIVER
Geomorphology
Though the Poteau River has a larger discharge than Fourche Maline Creek, the
valley floor of the Poteau is narrower (Table 2) because it crosses the nose of a plunging
fold, eroding of some resistant sandstone ridges of the Pennsylvanian Atoka Formation
(Miser 1954). At this location, the Poteau River valley is 0.9 to 1.8 km wide and terraces
are absent. Downstream ofthe Fourche Maline Creek confluence, the Poteau River
crosses the northern limb of the fold formed by the Atoka, Hartshorne, and McAlester
formations. Similar to the valley upstream if this confluence, the Poteau River valley is
relatively narrow (1.4-2.8 km wide) and terraces are absent.
Deposits
Surface deposits ofthe Poteau River are predominantly silt loam, with small areas
of sandy loam and loam (Figure 8; Table 2). Sand may accumulate as point bars by lateral
migration ofthe channel; however, the sandy sediment is rarely located adjacent to the
modem channel (Abernathy et aI. 1983). This distribution of sand suggests that channel
movement has not consistently been by migration across the valley to its present position.
The silty sediment is an overbank deposit that accumulates by vertical accretion during
flooding. It commonly decreases in grain size with increasing distance from the channel
(Guccione 1993). Quantitative analysis of the overbank deposit adjacent to the present
channel (mean = 43% of the clay-free fractions; Figure 9; Appendix B) substantiates that
this sediment includes more sand on a clay-free basis than the overbank deposit adjacent to
the valley wall (mean=27 percent) (Figure 10; Appendix B), but the channel position at the
time of overbank sedimentation is not definitively known.
Geometry of fluvial sediment within the Poteau River valley allows about the
movement of the channel across the valley and the relative age of sediment that fiIls the
valley floor. Two fluvial facies are present: (1) a sandy deposit that accumulated as a
point bar during lateral migration of the channel, and (2) a silty deposit that accumulated
as an overbank deposit by vertical accretion (Figure 8). No gravel channel deposit or
bedrock was encountered in any of the 3-to-4-m-deep trenches.

Figure 10. Profile of grain-size at north edge of geomorphological lransed across the Poteau River, adjacent to present
channel of the Poteau River (BHT-7).

The thickness of overbank sediment varies substantially across the flood plain
(Figure 8). It is absent in the center ofthe valley where a sand body forms an arcuate
outcrop parallel with an abandoned meander (Abernathyet al. 1983; Appendix A). To the
south of this outcrop, sand is buried by overbank sediment which thickens to > 1.8 m.
Contact between the point -bar sand and the overbank silt is gradational. Overbank
sediment is >3.1 m thick along the southern margin of the flood plain and between the
abandoned channel and the present channel. This depth is consistent with the 8-to-12-mdepth of the Poteau channel estimated from the topographic map.
Sand exposed in the transect across the Poteau River valley is interpreted as a
point bar deposited by the Poteau River. This point bar accumulated on the inside of a
meander as it migrated north from the southern valley wall to a terminal position presently
occupied by a slough in the middle of the valley floor. Up to 1.8 m of vertical accretion
silty clay overlies some ofthe point-bar sand (Figure 8, Appendix A). This stratigraphic
relationship is ubiquitous in the Interior Highlands. However, unlike many streams in the
Interior Highlands, the boundary between the overbank silt and the point-bar sand is
gradual and slopes away from the migration direction. This geometry indicates that the
flood plain of the Poteau River was probably aggrading and that the aggradation was >1.8
m during channel migration. No sand was exposed in the backhoe trench adjacent to the
southern valley wall. If point-bar sand is present at a greater depth, but the trench was not
deep enough to intersect it, aggradation was likely> 1.8 m. However, it is also possible
that point-bar sand is absent because a secondary or chute channel was maintained along
the southern valley wall as the channel migrated to the north. Fine-grained sediment
slowly inlilled the channel when it became inactive. As the paleochannel migrated to the
north and the point bar was being deposited on one side ofthe channel, older verticalaccretion deposits were being eroded along the northern channel margin.
Lack of sand between the abandoned paleochannel and the present channel is
evidence that the channel did not migrate to its present position, but abandoned the earlier
channel. The channel "avulsed" to its present position along the northern valley wall,
perhaps reoccupying an earlier abandoned channel position marked by a swale.
This study utilizes the geometry of fluvial sediment to support the conclusion that
the Poteau River in this area moves across the valley floor by two different processes.
First, the sinuous pattern of the river and the point-bar sand supports the conclusion that
the river migrates at times. Where the river migrates, new flood plain deposits
accumulate. Second, depressions of an abandoned channel on the flood plain and the lack
of a point-bar deposit between two successive channel positions supports the conclusion
that the channel can switch flow from one channel into a new path, which probably marks
the location of an earlier channel. In contrast to areas where channels have meandered,
sections of the flood plain between abandoned channels and the current channel can
preserve relatively old flood plain sediment.

In addition to lateral movement, a river may also experience vertical movement by
degradation or aggradation. Where streams are degrading, the highest altitude

bedrock/sediment contact marks the oldest portion of the valley bottom. Conversely, the
lower the bedrock surface, the younger the overlying fluvial sediment. Where the
overlying flood plain surfaces are different in altitude and form terraces, these relationships
are clear; the highest terrace is the oldest and the lowest surface is the youngest.
However, aggradation of fluvial sediment may be to the same altitude over different steps
in the bedrock incision. In this case, it may be impossible to identifY the relatively old and
relatively young portions to the fluvial deposit present in the valley without subsurface
information on the altitude of the alluvial/bedrock contact (Guccione, unpublished data).
Because bedrock was not exposed in any of the trenches, it is impossible to determine if
the depth of incision is uniform across the valley.
Soil
Soil series mapped on the Poteau River flood plain vary with drainage and with
texture of the parent material. Most of the flood plain is underlain by silty sediment (Table
2), and the moderately well-drained Neff soil series (alfisol) is mapped across much of the
flood plain (Abernathy et al. 1983). Three of the pedons described (Backhoe Trench
[BHT]-I, BHT-3, and BHT-5) are more similar to the well~drained Rexor soil series
(alfisol), although some areas of the flood plain are relatively better drained or relatively
poorly drained. On a small rise, a pedon similar to the well-drained Speer soil series
(alfisol) is present in BHT-2. Though this pedon does not have the loam texture
characteristic of the Speer soil, it does possess the yellowish red (5YR) color and does not
have reduced mottles. One pedon (BHT-6) is somewhat poorly drained and mapped as a
Cupco soil (a\fisol). This portion ofthe flood plain north ofthe slough does not occupy a
depression, but the silty clay parent material may be responsible for the relatively poor
drainage. The flood plain area south of the abandoned channel is underlain by sandy
sediment, and here the moderately well-drained Shermore soil series (alfisol) is present.
Floodplain soil is better developed south of the abandoned channel than it is
between the abandoned channel and the present channel. All of the pedons south of the
abandoned channel have an argillic horizon with an increase of clay abundance in the B
horizon (Figure 9), cutans, and soil structure (Appendix A). In these pedons, cutans are
not well developed but are present through a considerable thickness ofthe profile (57 cm299 cm), suggesting that the surfuce has aggraded during pedogenesis. The thickness
throughout which the cutans are present is thinner in the well-drained pedons (BHT-2 and
BHT-4) than in the moderately drained pedons (BHT-l, BHT-3, and BHT-5). Though
mapped as the same or a similar series, clay translocation is minimal or absent (Figure 10)
in the two pedons north of the abandoned channel. A few cutans were described in BHT7, but the lack of clay accumulation in the B horizon suggests that these may be pressure
faces due to expansion and contraction of the soil with wetting and drying episodes.
Archeological Deposits
Gravel is present within the upper 70 cm of the vertical accretion deposit at three
backhoe trench locations (BHT-l, BHT-2, and BHT-5). The abundance of gravel across

portions of the flood plain is verified by cobbles present on the modern land surface and
low rock walls that have been constructed between fields. These subangular fragments
range in size from granules to fieldstones up to 21 cm in diameter. Most ofthe gravel
does not appear to have any particular orientation and are not concentrated at any
particular depth. A small number exhibit an acutely angular appearance that might identifY
them as fire-cracked rock of cultural origin. These gravels are present both within and
beneath the plow zone, making it unlikely that they have been introduced to the area after
mechanical agricultural practices were introduced. These fragments may be manuports
that were introduced into the overbank deposit by humans, although only a few flakes
were found in association with the gravel. No archeological sites were transected by the
backhoe trenches, although a flake was found lying on the bottom ofBHT-2 that may
have fallen out ofa wall profile. In addition, three archeological sites (34LF3, 34LF192,
and 34LF698) have been documented in the same portion of the Johnson Bottoms.
Whether these rock fragments are associated with undocumented portions of one of these
sites is presently unknown. Regardless oftheir cultural or natural origin, however, the
presence of these angular gravel fragments strongly suggests that the Poteau River flood
plain has the potential to contain buried archeological sites.
Age
No suitable organic material was located in any of the soil cores or backhoe trenches, so
only relative ages can be determined for landforms and deposits of the Poteau River flood
plain. Because aggradation is significant in the study area, the surficial sediment is
probably of comparable age across the entire valley, but subsurface units may be of
varying ages. Based on the fluvial architecture of the valley, the youngest subsurface
deposit partially fills the abandoned Poteau River channel in the central valley floor;
intermediate age sediment has accumulated along the southern portion ofthe valley where
the channel migrated to the north; and the oldest sediment is preserved along the northern
portion of the valley, between the abandoned channel and the present channel.
Soil development does not support this relative age sequence. Although the
surface sediment has been interpreted to be approximately the same age across the valley
floor because of aggradation, more poorly developed soils are present in the northern
portion of the flood plain. It is possible that the aggradation rate is greater here and,
therefore, that pedogenetic development is less pronounced in the northern flood plain
because the channel is more proximal to the area, first within the abandoned channel and,
later, in the present channel.
Though the absolute ages ofthe sediment and associated landforms were not
determined, the age of some units can be constrained by archeological material. An
Archaic and Woodland archeological site, 34LF3, is located in the central part ofthe
valley, with spatial components both to the north and the south of the slough in the
abandoned meander. Site occupation must postdate channel migration to this location and
rapid flood plain aggradation. Therefore, the channel of the Poteau River occupied the
central valley prior to 2,300 yr BP, and perhaps before 8,000 yr BP (Table 2). lfthe

manuports identified in the backhoe trenches are associated with this archeological site
and are the same age at all locations, then up to 0.7 mofvertical accretion silt has
accumulated in the last 2,000 to 8,000 years and the greatest accumulation rate is adjacent
to the south valley wall. The moderate degree of soil development aon the Poteau flood
plain is consistent with soils that have been dated as Mid-Holocene in the Ozark
physiographic region north of the Arkansas River Valley (Figure 2) (Guccione, 1989;
Guccione, 1998a; Guccione, unpublished data).
Potential for Archeological Site Preservation
It is possible that buried archeological material Archaic period (ca. 8,000 yr BP),
or possibly even earlier, could be present in the overbank sediment on either side ofthe
abandoned channel in the Johnson Bottoms ofthe Poteau River flood plain although the
potential for the oldest material is higher, between the abandoned channel and the present
channel (Map 2). Intact archeological material is unlikely in the lower point-bar sand and
in the abandoned channel-fill along the slough.

FOURCHE MALINE CREEK
Geomorphology
Though the Fourche Maline Creek has a smaller discharge, this creek has a wider
valley than the Poteau River both upstream and downstream of its confluence with the
Fourche Maline (Table 2). This greater width may be attributed to the local bedrock
geology. Fourche Maline Creek is flowing along the strike ofa wide shale outcrop
between a folded sandstone ridge of the Pennsylvanian Atoka Formation, which forms the
north valley wall, and the Atoka Formation in the Ouachita thrust belt, which forms the
south valley wall (Miser 1954). Here the Fourche Maline Valley is 4.2 km wide. The
valley includes a flood plain which is 2.6 to 3.4 km wide and a single terrace. This terrace
is approximately 1.4 km wide along more than 16 km of the valley, and is dissected by
numerous small streams, some of which have relatively wide valleys. The Fourche Maline
Valley becomes slightly narrower near its confluence with the Poteau River because
resistant folded beds are present along the south valley margin which constrict the valley
floor to a 3.4-km width.
Deposits
Surface deposits on the terraces along Fourche Maline Creek are predominantly
silt loam and silty clay loam with gravelly material present at depth in some locations
(Abernathy et al. 1983; Table 2). Small areas containing mainly loam and sandy loam are
present. Two cores were sampled in these terrace deposits, one on the terrace north of
the flood plain (C-l) and one on the terrace south ofthe flood plain (C-4). On the
northern terrace, 1.9 m of silty clay loam overbank sediment overlies an unknown
thickness of gravelly clay loam channel fucies (Figure 11; AppendixA). On the southern

terrace, 1.4 m of silty clay and clay overbank sediment overlies 0.6 m of gravelly clay
channel facies. Because the terrace is dissected and accessibility was limited, both core
locations on the terraces are in eroded locations that probably underestimate the thickness
of the overbank facies. If the uneroded surface of the terrace is considered to be 170 m
above mean sea level and the bedrock surface is at a uniform leve~ the fluvial deposit may
be up to 7 m thick.
Surface deposits on the Fourche Maline flood plain are silt loam, silty clay loam,
and clay (Abernathy et al. 1983; Table 2). Unlike the Poteau River, no loam or sandy
loam has been mapped in the flood plain. Three cores were sampled across the flood
plain. Two of the core locations may be in abandoned channels. One core (C-3) was
sampled north of the present Fourche Maline channel in a ditch that may represent a
preexisting drainage channel. The other core (C-S) location is south of the present
channel, along a small natural drainage. The upper 3.0-3.9 m of alluvium at these
locations is silty clay and clay, and in C-3, the central 1.6 m of fill includes few to
abundant pebbles::: 2.5 cm in diameter. The basal portion of the alluvium is more coarsely
textured; in C-3, the basal 0.3 m is a gravelly clay, and in C-S the basal 0.6 m is sandy
with abundant pebbles in the lowest 0.1 m. The base of the fluvial sediment at both
locations is at an altitude of approximately 150.5 m arnsl. If this boundary is uniform
beneath the flood plain, approximately 4.5 m of alluvium fills the valley.
The third core (C-2) was placed on a flat surface of the flood plain, just south of
the present channel. Only 1.2 m of sediment could be penetrated. The core consists of a
silty clay loam, slightly coarser than at the other two locations, and grades down to a
loam. Though no gravel was present in the core, it is possible that gravel exists below 1.2
m that prevented deep core penetration. If so, the channel facies may be >5 m thick, and
the vertical accretion facies is relatively thin, except in abandoned channels where it
comprises most of the alluvium. However, the lack of gravel in the soil series mapped
along the flood plain (Abernathy et al. 1983) suggests that the overbank facies is > 1.5 m
thick along Fourche Maline Creek.
Because of the limited subsurface data available from the Fourche Maline valley,
the process of channel movement laterally and vertically within the valley is uncertain, but
some inferences can be made. The role of lateral movement has probably varied between
slow and fast. The sinuous form of the channel suggests that it has migrated slowly across
the valley floor. The absence of any point-bar landforms (Table 2) suggests that this
migration has not been recent and that these bar surfaces have been buried by an overbank
deposit that obscures the landform. The existence of abandoned chaDnels and alluvium
that is 90 % vertical accretion (C-3 and C-S) also suggests that the channel can also
change positions rapidly and that the abandoned channels infill with vertical accretion
sediment. Many of the channel changes appear to be movement ofthe active channel into
a preexisting depression rather than a cutoff through a narrow neck where a meander
becomes increasingly sinuous as it migrates.

In contrast, vertical channel movement is apparently minimal. Over long time
scales, Fourche Maline Creek is degrading because it is in a highland area, but the channel
does not appear to have aggraded or degraded significantly over a relatively short time
scale. The observations lead to the hypothesis that aggradation of the channel has not
been substantial. First, bedrock is present in the channel floor. Second, topographic maps
indicate that the depth of the channel is 3 m to 6 m, which is consistent with the 4.S m of
alluvium present in C-S and the altitude ofthe alluvium-bedrock contact in C-3 and C-S
(Table 2). Two additional observations suggest that degradation of the channel has not
been substantial recently. First, the alluvium-bedrock contact has a uniform elevation
across much of the valley (at least between C-3 and C-S, a distance of 1.1 km), suggesting
that degradation of the channel to this elevation has been stable for a considerable period
oftime and the river has had time to migrate across this distance without significant
incision. Second, relatively thick vertical accretion deposits exhibiting little topographic
relief across the entire valley suggest that the river has been vertically and horiwntally
stable for some time. The mapped soil across the entire flood plain has > 1.S m of finegrained parent material (Abernathy et al. 1983), which is consistent with the minimum of
1.2 m of vertical accretion sediment at the three core localities (Table 2). Rapid channel
migration would constantly rework the alluvium, preventing significant accumulation of
overbank deposits, and significant incision would change the flood plain to a terrace where
overbank sedimentation was minimal to absent.

Soil
Because of significant incision into the relatively high terrace along Fourche
Maline Creek, a large variety of soils are present (Abernathy et al. 1983). The most
common are the moderately well-drained Stigler soil series (alfisol), developed in silty
parent material, and the well-drained Sallisaw soil series (alfisol), developed in loamy and
gravelly alluvium. Incision into the terrace can extend through most of the alluvium, and
soils developed in bedrock are also present. In the cores examined during this study, the
soil on the northern terrace is somewhat poorly drained soil with an argillic horizon and is
similar to the Cupco soil series rather than the mapped Sallisaw soil series. The soil
examined on the southern terrace is most similar to the Stigler soil series, as mapped.
Unlike the Stigler soil, only a cambic B horiwn is present in this pedon, perhaps because
this occupies an erosional landscape position and any argillic horizon that was once
present has been removed.
Similar to the Poteau River flood plain, the Neff soil (alfisol) has been mapped on
the Fourche Maline flood plain because of the thick overbank sediment deposited by
vertical accretion (Table 2). Unlike the Poteau River, the Neff soil is the only soil that is
mapped, indicating that no significant areas of gravelly, loamy, or sandy parent material
are present in the upper 1.S m of the alluvium. Cores examined for this study confirm the
presence of silt and clay parent material as mapped, but the drainage and degree of soil
development is more variable than indicated by the soil map. The C-2 and C-3 cores are
somewhat poorly drained and are more similar to the Cupco soil (alfisol). The C-S core is
a moderately well-drained Neff soil consistent with the soil map. The C-2 and C-S cores

have argillic B horizons with cutans and an increase of clay abundance, as expected for the
Neff or Cupco soil series. No cutans or clay accumulation was noted in the B horizon of
C-3. It is possible that the fill in this paleochannel is relatively recent and that only a
cambic B horizon has developed.
Archeological Deposits
No archeological sites or cultural material was identified in cores from Fourche
Maline Creek valley.
Age
No suitable organic material was located during the study, so only relative ages
have been determined. The terrace on both sides ofthe valley is 15 m above the flood
plain, and this landform and the sediment that underlies it are considerably older than that
which underlies the flood plain. Because of dissection, much of the surface and the soil on
the terrace may be considerably younger than the deposit from which they formed. The
age of the terrace and the associated deposits is unknown, but they are most likely late
Pleistocene (Table 2). If so, only surface archeological sites would be expected, except
where Holocene alluviation has accumulated in tributaries or Holocene colluvium has
accumulated at the base of slopes.
Surficial sediment across the flood plain may be of varying ages because the land
surface has probably been stable for a relatively long time. Abandoned channels and their
fill are probably a variety of ages because the channel moves across the flood plain. A
variable degree of soil development on the flood plain supports this observation.
The age of some of the flood plain surface can be constrained by the associated
archeological material. Archeological sites on the flood plain range from Archaic (most
are middle to late Archaic) to historic. This indicates that at least part ofthe flood plain
could be 7,000 to 8,000 years old (Table 2). Argillic horizons in some soil suggest that
accumulation on this surface is relatively slow and the degree of weathering is moderate.
This moderate degree of soil development is consistent with soils that have been dated as
niid-Holocene in the Ozark physiographic region, north of the Arkansas River valley
(Figure 1) (Guccione 1989, 1998b; Guccione, unpublished data).

CONCLUSIONS
The Poteau River and Fourche Maline Creek are both meandering streams
dissecting a highland area, but there are some significant differences between the streams.
The Poteau River has a larger discharge, a deeper channel, and a thicker accumulation of
alluvium than Fourche Maline Creek (Table 2). Though the discharge and the channel are
larger, the valley of the Poteau River is narrower than the Fourche Maline because the
valIey width is constricted by resistant ridges of sandstone where the river is eroding into a

fold. The character of the Poteau River apparently changed, probably during the Early or
Middle Holocene. Previously, the channel had slowly migrated across the valley as it
aggraded, depositing a sandy point bar along the inside ofthe meander bend. More
recently, the channel has switched channel positions, leaving an abandoned meander that is
presently occupied by a small tributary stream and infilling with thick silty clay. Unlike the
earlier channel, which had a sandy point bar, the present channel may be narrower with
steeper channel walls of cohesive silt and clay. Most of the present aggradation in the
valley is restricted to filling abandoned channels and/or infilling a larger channel. Vertical
aggradation of overbank sediment across the entire flood plain is probably minimal. As a
result, the older point bar morphology and one Archaic to Woodland period archeological
site (34LF3) is preserved on the surface. The preservation of these features suggests that
the change in fluvial style and most of the surficial sediment may be Middle Holocene.
The morphology and archeology of the Poteau River flood plain downstream of this
transect is similar and probably has a similar fluvial history.
Morphology of the Fourche Maline flood plain is different than that of the Poteau
River. Despite the difference in valley bottom width and alluvium thickness, the cross
sectional area of the alluvium in Fourche Maline Creek is similar to that of the Poteau
River and suggests that approximately the same volume of sediment is stored in the valley
(Table 2). The similar altitude of bedrock at the distal margins of the flood plain suggests
that the river has probably moved across most of the flood plain since the incision to this
level. Though the channel is sinuous, it does not have a point bar morphology, and no
significant channel deposits are present at the surface so the sinuousity may have been
inherited from an earlier period. Channel deposits that are present are predominantly
gravel, but the gravel may only be a minor component of the alluvium in the valley. Thus,
the Fourche Maline Creek has apparently moved across its valley floor by switching
channel positions, leaving abandoned meanders that are presently occupied by a small
tributary stream and infilling with thick silty clay. This style of movement across the flood
plain is similar to that inferred for the Poteau River, but it has probably been occurring for
a longer period of time. The presence of surface archeological sites suggests that
significant flood plain accumulation has not occurred since the Early Holocene (7,0008,000 years ago). However, localized fill in abandoned channels may be much younger.
The morphology and archeology of the Fourche Maline Creek flood plain downstream of
this transect is similar and probably has a similar fluvial history.
This study illustrates that detailed and deep examination of fluvial sediment across
the entire valley floor is necessary to determine the fluvial history of a river and the
potential for preservation of surface or buried artifacts. Such a study should include the
distribution of channel, abandoned channel, and overbank deposits and the altitude of the
sedimentlbedrock contact. If the time scale over which the flood plain has evolved is
Holocene to late Pleistocene, this detailed history is critical for the assessment of site
potential. Identification of older sediment would preclude investigation for buried sites in
these areas. Although the tendency is to concentrate on the surficial materials, as this is
often where archeological sites are most easily detected, this surficial examination does
not account for the evolutionary history of a valley. Cultural remains may not be present

at the depth required for a detailed geomorphic study, but examination of material at depth
and across the entire valley is necessary to define channel movement and hence the relative
age of areas on the flood plain, as well as the potential for archeological site location in
those areas.
