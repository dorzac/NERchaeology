ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the Brushy Creek Trail Road right-of-way and Champion
Park Connector (totaling 2,050 feet of trail and right-of-way) was conducted by American
Archaeological Group, LLC (AAG) in December 2013 under the auspices of Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 6728. This project was performed for the Williamson County
Parks & Recreation Department. This investigation was performed using the pedestrian
survey method supported by shovel probing since the area had thin soils on bedrock. No
cultural resources were identified, therefore, it is recommended by AAG that
construction within the project area be allowed to proceed as planned, and monitoring
during construction by an archaeologist is not necessary. No artifacts were collected,
therefore, no curation was arranged.

INTRODUCTION
The Williamson County Parks & Recreation Department plans to construct a
trail that will connect the Brushy Creek Regional Trail system between Brushy Creek
Lake Park and Champion Park. This portion involves 1,850 feet x 75 feet from the
southern edge of County Road 174 south to the park boundary fence in Cedar Park,
Williamson County, Texas. The second small trail is approximately 200 linear feet
that runs northwest – southeast from County Road 174 into Brushy Creek Lake Park
and connects the park to the regional trail system. The project area is depicted on the
7.5’ U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle Leander dated 1987 (Figure 1 ). The U.T.M.
coordinates for the approximate center of the tract are Easting 618860 and Northing
3475740.
The project area begins approximately 2,000 feet east of Parmer lane along
County Road 174. The nearest water source was South Brushy Creek, which is the
southern border of the project area. The topographic position of the project area
fluctuates from 800 to 830 feet in elevation above mean sea level (amsl).
Previous archaeological surveys in Williamson County have identified significant
prehistoric and historic sites. Therefore, an archaeological survey was required by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC), the lead review and compliance agency, before
construction of the park is allowed to proceed. In order to satisfy this requirement, the
Williamson County Parks & Recreation Department in Williamson County, Texas
contracted with American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) to perform this service.
The project was conducted under the auspices of Antiquities Permit Number 6728.

ENVIROMENTAL SETTING
General
The project area is located within the Texan biotic province as defined by Blair
(1950:110-102). This province includes the broad ecotone between the forests of the
Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces of eastern Texas and Oklahoma and the grasslands
of the western parts of these states (Dice 1943). According to Blair (1950:100), the
southwestern boundary is arbitrarily defined by soil type at the line separating pedalfers
from pedocals. The Balcones escarpment forms an abrupt western boundary for the central
part of this province in Texas, and the western boundary in north Texas corresponds to the
western boundary of the Western Cross Timbers. Rainfall in the Texan province barely
exceeds water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite (1948) as a moist subhumid
climate with a moisture surplus index of from zero to 20 percent.
Soils
One soil series was located in the study area as depicted on sheet 73 of the Soil Survey
of Williamson County, Texas (Werchan and Coker 1980): Eckrant cobbly clay (EaD).
The Eckrant cobbly clay soils are residual in situ soils located along valley toe slopes
and have a very low potential for buried intact assemblages of artifacts. The Eckrant
cobbly clay (EaD) consists of shallow, well drained soils found on undulating uplands.
Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Typically, the solum is 13 to 51 centimeters thick.
The A horizon is a 10 to 28 centimeter thick, very dark gray to black, clay to clay
loam. The horizon is calcareous and contains 35 to 80 percent pebbles, gravels and
cobbles. Gravel to small cobble sized limestone fragments cover approximately 25
percent of the surface. There is no B horizon. The R horizon is approximately 13 to 28
centimeter thick coarsely fractured limestone (Werchan and Coker 1980).

Vegetation
The vegetation of this area has been described in detail by Tharp (1926). The Texan
province has been defined as being located near the borderline between moisture surplus and
moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support an oak-hickory forest in which the principal
dominants are post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), and
hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of
this soil type has been put into cultivation. The reader is referred to Blair (1950) for an indepth description of the Texan Biotic province.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Williamson County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical
region as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central Texas
by most archaeologists and is rich archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Williamson County and vicinity have
prepared by various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at the Fort Hood
Military Installation (Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al. 1981, Thomas 1978; Roemer et
al. 1985, Carlson et al. 1986), Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site
(Shafer1963), and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964: Sorrow et al. 1967).
Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981, 1985) have published summaries of the region.
Additional work by Prewitt (1974) at the Loeve-Fox site has also provided additional
data on local inhabitants in Williamson County, Texas. Most recently, two thorough
articles concerning Central Texas were published in Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the
Texas Archeological Society. These works, entitled “Forty Years of Archaeology in
Central Texas,” by Michael B. Collins (1995) and “Implications of Environmental
Diversity in the central Texas Archaeological Region” by Linda Wootan Ellis, G. Lain
Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995), represent a major synthesis of the vast amount of
collected data for the region. The following discussion is taken primarily from the works
cited above.
Paleoindian Period
According to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term
“Paleoindian;” nevertheless, the term is used ubiquitously in the archaeological literature,
often to refer to prehistoric cultures oriented toward big game procurement as a primary
means of subsistence. Collins (1995:381) posited instead that during Clovis times,
Paleoindians exploited a diverse range of fauna that not only included large herbivores
such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but also included smaller animals such as turtles,
land tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons. The results of excavation of a
cultural pavement at Kincaid Rockshelter suggest that the Paleoindian inhabitants of the
site returned there repeatedly as part of a regular hunting and gathering strategy, in
contrast with the migratory subsistence pattern of nomadic hunters who only pursued big
game. Thus, it is probable that the Clovis diet included a broad array of plants (Collins
1990; Collins et al. 1989).
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood time periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because so few sites have
been excavated. For example, as of 1985, only two Paleoindian sites had been reported
for Bell County (Biesaart et al. 1985:125). Evidence of Paleoindian cultures consists
primarily of surface-collected materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort Hood,
distinctive Paleoindian projectile points were found in multi-component surface sites and
as isolated finds (Carlson et al. 1986:125). Generally, it is believed that this period lasted
from about 10,000 B.C. until 6000 B.C. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include dart

4

points of the Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Golondrina, and Plainview types as defined by
Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Turner and Hester (1985).
These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and may
be more distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan 1931).
Some rockshelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are
located a considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of a rockshelter in
Central Texas immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleoindian
occupation is the Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County, Texas (Redder 1985).
Collins (1999) reported on the Gault Site, a major Clovis site in Bell County that is still
being studied.
Archaic Period
The Archaic is a comparatively lengthy cultural period, which persisted in Central
Texas from approximately 8500-1250 years Before Present (B.P.). According to Prewitt
(1981:71), “The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas.” Prewitt
(1981) has subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. Johnson (1987) has questioned the
validity of the phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the phases occurring before
the Middle Archaic. Carlson et al. (1986:15) grouped these into Early, Middle, Late, and
Terminal Periods.
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a “strong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population
was of low density.” These characteristics apparently were predominant during the
Circleville, San Geronimo, and Jarrell phases (8500-5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic,
food gathering apparently became very specialized as evidenced by the presence of
numerous burned rock middens/mounds (Prewitt 1981:78-80). Prewitt divides the Middle
Archaic into the Oakalla, Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000-2600
B.P.). It appears that considerably fewer burned rock middens were formed during the
Late Archaic than in the earlier Archaic. The archaeological record indicates that while
bison were important in the diet of prehistoric peoples, they were not necessarily the
principal food source during this time (Prewitt 1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred
during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600-1750 B.P.). The terminal Archaic,
according to the classification by Carlson et al. (1986), includes the Twin Sisters and
Driftwood phases (1750-1250 B.P.). An increase in the importance of gathering and an
apparent peak in site density seem to have occurred during Prewitt’s (1981:82) Driftwood
phase. A majority of the sites in Williamson County are Archaic in age, which,
according to Prewitt (1981:Figure 3), lasted from 8500-1250 B.P. This interpretation is
supported by Collins’ (1995:383) assertion that “two-thirds of the prehistory of Central
Texas is ‘Archaic’ in character.”

5

Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been characterized in the archaeological literature as the NeoAmerican Stage (Suhm et al. 1954), the Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and the Post-Archaic
(Johnson and Goode 1994). The Late Prehistoric is typically divided into the Austin
(1250-650 B.P.) and Toyah (650-200 B.P.) phases. Technological changes are the
primary distinguishing characteristic of this stage. The archaeological record indicates
that during this period, the bow and arrow became the principal weapon for hunting and
warfare, and that the use of ceramics and the practice of horticulture first appeared in
Central Texas and the surrounding regions.
According to Collins (1995:385), during the Late Prehistoric of Central Texas, the
bow and arrow were the first of these cultural innovations to be adopted, followed by
pottery, and finally agriculture though it was of relatively minor importance. Until the
onset of these Late Prehistoric adaptations, most cultural groups continued to practice
hunting and gathering as their principal means of subsistence, as had their ancestors
throughout the Archaic and Paleoindian periods. However, in about 800 B.P., evidence
for a different subsistence adaptation appears in the archaeological record and this
cultural time boundary marks the separation between the late Archaic and the Austin and
Toyah phases of the Late Prehistoric period (Collins 1995:385).
The most obvious of the changes that emerged at the beginning of the Late
Prehistoric period was the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the
atlatl or spear thrower. Otherwise, life ways in the Late Prehistoric were probably quite
similar to those in the earlier Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A
chronological model of bison presence and absence periods on the southern plains
suggests that bison were present during the Toyah phase but not during the preceding
Austin phase (Dillehay 1974).
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the historic period of Central Texas into three subperiods: early, middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and
European peoples and cultures were present; however, in the third the indigenous peoples
had virtually disappeared. The early historic sub-period in Central Texas began in the
late 17th century with the first documented arrival of Europeans. Williamson County is
situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who inhabited the area in the
16th Century (Newcomb 1986). By the 19th Century, they had broken ties with the
Comache and Wichita and were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32). They
have been described as typical southern Plains Indians who were hunters and gathers and
who lived along the streams and rivers of Central Texas. Remains of this group have not
been found in an historic context in Williamson County.
During this period, numerous aboriginal groups including the Caddo, Jumano,
Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986) occupied Texas. Trade is
known to have existed between the Jumanos and the Caddos. The Lipan Apaches and

6

subsequently the Comanches entered the region from the Plains while following key
animal resources as they migrated into Texas. Contact period occupations are often
identified by the occurrences of glass beads, gun parts, gunflints, metal projectile points,
and European manufactured ceramics. The archival search did not locate any Historic
Indian sites in Williamson County. In nearby Coryell County, a blue glass bead was
found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group burial along the Leon River (Jackson
1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an isolated find on Horse Creek in the
extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952).
The earliest European expedition likely to have visited present-day Williamson
County was led by Spaniard Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca. They wandered throughout
Texas from 1527 to 1535. Some workers believe that the eight months spent among the
Avavares Indians relates to Tonkawas of the Williamson area (Scarbrough 1973:52).
The French governor of Texas, Robert Cavalier Sieur de la Salle, led the next
recorded European visitation. In 1686 and 1687, La Salle met Indians and described
landmarks that, according to some scholars, were of Williamson County (Hackett
1931:519-520).
In response to French activity in Texas, Captain Alonso de Leon followed
Spanish government orders by building El Camino Real (The King’s Highway) in 1688.
This road would be used to establish missions being planned for east Texas. It was soon
discovered that this roadway skirting just to the east of present Williamson County
became impassable when heavy rains overflowed the streams. In such wet times, De
Leon designated a route to the west and north as the Camino de Arriba (the Upper
Route). This road crossed Brushy Creek, the San Gabriel River, and the Brazos River
just north of its confluence with the Little River. In his recorded trip along this route, De
Leon left “‘a bull, a cow, a stallion, and a mare at each river he crossed,’ thus
significantly contributing to the mustang and longhorn population of Texas” (Gard 1954).
Passing through the heart of Williamson County, De Leon’s trail-blazing effort represents
the first unequivocal Spanish exploration of the area immediately surrounding the project
area.
In 1691, Spanish governor of Texas Domingo Teran de los Rios brought herds of
cattle to the missions established the year before. Consisting of 50 soldiers and 13
churchmen, this entourage passed through southeastern Williamson County (Casteneda
1936 I:362, Bancroft 1884 XV:391, and Gard 1954:5).
The next expedition to pass through Williamson County occurred under the
leadership of Spanish Captain Domingo Ramon and the dashing French trader Juchereau
de Saint Denis. The Ramon-St. Denis entourage, consisting of 75 men, 64 oxen, 490
horses and mules, and more than a thousand sheep and goats, spent several weeks in
present-day Williamson and adjoining Milam Counties. They met and traded with
several thousand Native Americans of various tribes. One of its clergy, Fray Espinosa,
named several of the streams (Casteneda 1936 II:42, and 51).

7

The Aguayo expedition was the largest Spanish exploration effort to cross present
day Williamson County. In fall of 1720, el Marques de Aguayo launched one of the
largest expeditions ever launched to establish Spanish dominion over the province of
Texas: 500 men, 600 loads of supplies, 4000 horses, 600 cattle, 900 sheep, and almost
800 mules. After traveling nearly a thousand miles, the huge delegation reached the
Colorado River. From there, it proceeded northeastward, crossing Chandler Branch and
the South and North branches of the San Gabriel River in central Williamson County
(Casteneda 1936 II:131, 137). After traveling across the Lampasas, Salado, San Andres
(now called the Little), and Brazos Rivers to the north of the County, the entourage
turned eastward near present-day Waco to reestablish the inactive Spanish missions
founded in 1691. In successfully re-planting permanent presence in Texas, this last of the
major expeditions had kept the French from capturing Texas (Bolton 1962:144, Bolton
1939:17-18, and Morfi 1935 I:221-223).
In general, the expedition followed present-day Interstate 35 through Williamson
County (Hackett 1931:474). Following the advice of a Tonkawan chief El Cuilon (also
called Juan Rodriguez), Aguayo had followed the El Camino de Arriba through
Williamson County, rather than the more heavily traveled El Camino Real which the
chief had deemed to be impassable for this huge expedition because of marshes and thick
woods (Hackett 1931:474).
The Spanish Army waged war against the Lipan Apache in the Williamson
County area for 14 years. The area became renowned for its buffalo (Morfi 1935 I:221223; Bolton 1939:17-18; Bolton 1962:27-28, 30, 141; and Hackett 1931:492). A
particularly large Indian settlement called Rancheria Grande attracted frequent Spanish
visitations during the first four decades of the eighteenth century to recruit candidates for
the San Antonio missions. In 1746, the Spanish established Mission San Francisco Xavier
de Horcasitas on the San Gabriel River just east of Williamson County to address the
spiritual needs of the Native Americans and to fend off French incursions by also
establishing a trade network with the local tribes (Bolton 1962:45, 150-151, 153-156,
160, 166, 185; Gilmore 1969:143).
Just two years later, Mission Xavier was destroyed by the Apache. However, by
the 1749, two new missions, San Ildefonso and Candelaria, opened, and Xavier was
rebuilt. All three were simultaneously utilized for the next 7 years. To add protection,
Presidio San Francisco Xavier de Gigedo was established in 1751. But fortunes turned
tragic. Infighting among the Spanish left the Native American neophytes discouraged.
Many retreated into the wilderness. In 1756, the missions were abandoned. Although
now actually in Williamson County, these three missions and presidio impacted daily life
of every Native American living for many miles around (Scarbrough 1973:63-64).
As early as the early 1820s, a few pioneers of Austin’s Colony drifted beyond its
boundaries to settle in the valleys of Brushy Creek and San Gabriel River. The main
body of Williamson County was part of the Robertson Colony. Most of the original
settlers of 1835 lighted at Salado, Bell County. Most of Williamson County’s earliest

8

residents came from Bastrop and the Webber’s Prairie area to the south and the Brazos
River to the east (Scarbrough 1973:64-70).
Within the State of Coahuila and Texas, the earliest regional governing precursor
to Williamson County was the Municipality of District of Viesca. This district lay
northwest of the Camino Real, extending to the east beyond the Brazos valley. Along the
Brazos, Tenoxtitlan, a Mexican military post abandoned in 1832, became a large trading
post, the closest one to the settlements of Williamson County. The seats of government
also were located on the West Bank of the Brazos, first in Sarahville de Viesca, five miles
north of Marlin, Falls county, and then Nashville, between present-day Gause and Hearne
(Scarbrough 1973:71-77).
Far removed from official security, these remote settlers suffered frequent Indian
attacks. Surveyor Thomas A. Graves was ambushed by Indians while working on the
San Gabriel River in the fall of 1835. A surveyor named Lang was killed by Indians in
1836 while working at the headwaters of Brushy Creek (Scarbrough 1973:76). Neil
McLennan, Sr. and his family suffered several dangerous encounters in the San Gabriel
Valley. These attacks stimulated the organizing of one of the three original Texas Ranger
companies in 1835. They built a cedar facility near present Leander called the Tumlinson
Block House (Barker, Eugene C., 1925:329-330; Smithwick 1900:213; Yoakum 1856
II:265-267; Webb 1952 II:690; Brown 1896:85; De Shields 1912:90-93; and Wilbarger
1889:190-192).
During 1835, the District was renamed the Municipality of Milam. The Mexican
Army invaded Texas to put down the Revolution. This caused the Runaway Scrape,
causing many of the Anglo-American settlers in the Williamson County area to flee.
During this time, Tumlinson’s Block House Fort was burned by Indians. Most of this
company of Rangers had departed to assist General Sam Houston at San Jacinto. The
command of this company was placed under Major Robert M. Williamson (Bolton
1962:141).
With General Houston’s victory at San Jacinto, the Republic of Texas began to
govern the vast territory. Milam was made a county, one of 23 original counties in the
Republic. In 1837, the United States suffered a devastating crop failure and depression.
Many of these newest immigrants settled in Milam County. Many more Swedish
immigrants settled in present-day Williamson County. The first organized settlement in
Williamson County was Kenney’s Fort, located just east of present-day Round Rock. Dr.
Thomas Kenney built a house and fort on an elevated coveland on the south bank of
Brushy Creek, just west of where Dyer Branch flows northward into Brushy Creek.
Indian raids plagued the first settlers. In 1839, a particularly bloody conflict, the Battle of
Brushy, resulted in the death of several colonists and 20 to 30 Native Americans.
Williamson County territory was the setting for several other skirmishes occurred with
Indians (Scarbrough 1973:80-97).

9

Williamson County played a crucial role in two crucial incidents involving
ongoing relations between Texas and Mexico. One was the Flores-Cordova Affair, and
the other was the Santa Fe Expedition.
In 1839, a prolonged chase led to the Texas Rangers capturing a party of Mexican
officials between the North and South San Gabriel. Specifically, they were cornered on a
steep bluff of the North San Gabriel River, probably overlooking our project area.
Although most escaped, the Texians recovered at least 156 horses and mules, several
hundred pounds of gunpowder, and a variety of luggage. In the bags, they discovered
several official communications revealing a plot to incite Indians against the government
of Texas (Scarbrough 1973:89-92).
Two years later, Texas forces met at Kenney Fort and other sites north of Austin
to head for New Mexico. The expedition met with bitter failure, as the forces were
poorly organized and New Mexico remained loyal to the government of Mexico
(Scarbrough 1973:98-101).
Relations between Native Americans and settlers remained hostile, producing
deadly conflicts throughout this period. Dr. Thomas Kenney, founder of Kenny Fort, was
killed by Indians. A notable mediator who resolved numerous conflicts between Indians
and settlers was Delaware tribesman Jim Shaw (Scarbrough 1973:103-108).
The 1840s witnessed steady growth of this area. New communities arose around
mills, churches, and general stores. Makemson identifies the location of these
settlements: “At the time the county was organized, with few exceptions, the settlements
were confined to Brushy Creek and San Gabriel River. Comparatively few settlements
were made far out in the prairies until the era of barbed wire and the advent of railroads:
(Makemson 1904). New stage lines were added. A line connecting San Antonio to
Waco was the first to run through the heart of Williamson County area. The first general
mercantile store in the county was opened by nelson Morey in 1848 just south of present
Hutto. That same year, R. H. Taliaferro organized Missionary Baptist Church, the area’s
first Protestant church (Scarbrough 1973:108-115). Also in 1848, the county’s first
school was built at Moss’s Spring, just west of present Round Rock (Makemson 1904).
Led by San Jacinto hero Washington Anderson, a campaign was launched in 1848
to create a new county in this area north of Travis County. It was impractical to travel all
the way to Nashville to conduct Milam County government business involving this area.
The population well exceeded the 250 estimated by various historians. The Legislature
agreed, naming the area after longtime Judge Robert McAlpin Williamson on March 13th,
1848. The Judge officiated over court many times throughout Milam County.
In May 1848, a tract of land lying between the North and South San Gabriel
Rivers, just south of their confluence was donated by George Washington Glasscock for
the count seat. In his honor, it was named “Georgetown” (Scarbrough 1973:113-127). It
was located near the post office of Brushy, which had been established the year before
(Scarbrough 1973:145).

10

Conflicts between settlers and Indians gradually declined throughout the 1850s as
the Indians were reported as becoming increasingly friendlier (Scarbrough 1973:141).
The last Indian attack occurred as Mr. and Mrs. Wofford Johnson and their daughter were
killed in western Williamson County on August 15, 1863. After that time, Comanches
still ranged the area, although attacks were rare because of the presence of the Texas
Rangers. Most of these lawmen were called to the Confederate cause in the Civil War,
but the survivors reorganized and returned to duty after the war (Makemson 1904:11-12,
and Maltby 1906:20, 23-34, 26-27, 150-152, and 204).
By 1850, the population of Williamson County had grown to 1,568, and reached
3,779 by 1858 (Scarbrough 1973:141). In the 1860 Census, the County’s population was
4,529, which rose slightly during the tumultuous Civil War and Reconstruction years to
6,368 by 1870. During Post-Bellum industrialization and tenant farm transition,
population exploded to 15,155 in 1880, the highest rate of increase over a 10-year period
in the County’s history. By 1870, Indian violence against settlers had been halted,
encouraging much greater settlement. Population continued to increase but at a slightly
lower rate, being 25,909 in 1890, 38,072 in 1900, and 42,228 in 1910. From 1920 to
1970, population levels actually decline, but they explode in the past 25 years as
Williamson County became part of the Austin Metropolitan Area (Texas Almanac 1993:
335).
The City of Georgetown follows a similar pattern of population increase. From
1850 to 1870, it experienced modest growth from 200 to 320. From 1870 to 1880,
phenomenal growth yields 1,354, and it almost doubles to 2,447 in 1890. Increases were
slight through 1960, except for 1920 when populations slightly declined (United States
Census).
The frontier moved westward, leaving in its wake a growing population and
farming area in western central Texas. The earliest farms grew commodities necessary
for sustaining life for the pioneer settlers. Of the 249,528 acres of land comprising the
County in 1858, only 22,618 acres were in cultivation. These consisted of 11,100 acres
planted in corn, 9,350 in wheat, and 1,378 in cotton. As property of citizens, 4,000
horses and 25,000 cattle were listed (Scarbrough 1973:141). Peaches and hogs also are
listed as agricultural commodities. In the 1850 U. S. Census, three-fourths of the men
were listed as “farmers,” and most of the others’ occupations were listed jointly with
“farmer” (United States Census, 1850).
John S. Knight planted some of the first massive amounts of cotton in the County
in 1870. Many acres of eastern Williamson County became planted in cotton during the
1870s and -80s. Gins and mills involving the spin-off cottonseed industry flourished in
Circleville, Granger, Taylor, and Georgetown. In 1899-1900, Williamson County led the
state in number of bales of cotton produced. The County’s first gristmill was built by
Wash Anderson on the north bank of Brushy creek in 1843, at present Round Rock.
After its destruction by flood in 1845, others were maintained in the area throughout the
19th century. Other Antebellum mills were: Gann’s Mill on Berry’s Creek from 1846 to
1916; Gooch’s mills from 1849 onward; Mather’s mill from 1852; Ira Chalk’s mill in

11

1855; and Knight’s Springs mills of Benjamin Gooch and John W. Owens, between 1852
and 1855 (Scarbrough 1973:161-162). Throughout the Post-Bellum period to the end of
the 19th Century, numerous mills flourished throughout the County processing corn,
syrup, and other products. Carried out mostly in the western portions of the County, the
cattle industry reached its zenith from 1875 to 1900 (Scarbrough 1973:233-235).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
In the site files at TARL are numerous pieces of correspondence from landowners
and artifact collectors documenting and describing sites and artifacts found in Williamson
County. Also present are copies of unpublished manuscripts, some of which do not
provide information concerning author and date of preparation. Information regarding
previous work in other parts of Williamson County appears in the various references
cited above.
Williamson County has been the scene of numerous investigations by professional
archaeologists at various levels from small projects by private contractors, universities, and
state agencies to large area surveys such as Granger and North Fork Reservoirs, the first
large-scale projects in the county. Very little systematic work was carried out in Williamson
County prior to the initial survey of the proposed North Fork, South Fork and Laneport
(now referred to as Granger) reservoirs in 1963 (Shafer and Corbin 1965) as part of the
Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP). Prior to this effort, two published articles
documenting archaeological work in the county were published by T.N. Campbell (1948)
and Mardith K. Schuetz (1957).
In 1963, TASP surveyed the sites of the proposed reservoirs. At North Fork, 44 sites
were recorded, over half of which are burned rock middens or sites buried in alluvial
deposits (ceramics were only found at one site [41WM71]); at South Fork, 30 sites were
identified, almost half of which were burned rock middens; and at Laneport 10 sites were
recorded. At this reservoir, both burned rock middens and alluvial terrace sites were found,
but it was concluded that only the latter type of site could be said to be typical of the
Laneport area (Shafer and Corbin 1965:47). At approximately 10 miles north of Taylor,
Laneport Reservoir is the site of the closest major archaeological survey to the project area
except for Brushy Creek about five miles to the southeast. Additional work in the area was
conducted by Frank W. Eddy (1973) at Laneport, William S. Sorrow (Jackson 1974) at
North Fork and Prewitt (1974, 1982) at Granger.
These early studies were not conducted using intensive or systematic sampling
procedures. Therefore, in May 1976, the Anthropology Laboratory at Texas A&M
University (TAMU) began an intensive archaeological site survey and assessment program
of all government owned lands in the North Fork and Granger reservoir boundaries
(Patterson and Moore 1976). Work by TAMU consisted of a preliminary assessment
(Patterson and Moore 1976), an archeological survey of Granger (Moore, Shafer and Weed
1978) and North Fork (Patterson and Shafer 1980).
Several sites were tested prior to the inundation of Granger Reservoir. Site
41WM21 was tested by TAMU. In 1976, Gary L. Moore (1976, 1977, 1978) tested sites
41WM21, 41WM124, and 41WM133. Clell L. Bond (1978) tested 41WM30, 41WM284,
and 41WM294 in 1977. Site 41WM21 was determined to represent an intermittent
occupation during the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods of Texas prehistory.

13

The work at sites 41WM30, 41WM284, and 41WM294 was designed to determine
possible similarities in lithic procurement and reduction at the three sites and to explain
behavior patterns manifested in the archaeological deposits at 41WM130. This study
established that 41WM130 had been periodically occupied from the Twin Sisters through
Toyah phases. It was determined that the subsistence pattern of the site's inhabitants
remained nearly constant through time and included the wide ranging exploitation of
resources found in the San Gabriel Valley. It was postulated that the availability of lithic
resources was one of the principal reasons that this site was reused as during such a lengthy
interval.
The next large-scale survey near the project area was along Brushy Creek in 1974
by TAMU (Shafer 1974). Six sites (41WM273 - 41WM278) were recorded as a result of
this project. All are on the Taylor topographic quadrangle. The four prehistoric sites are
thin lithic scatters. None of the sites were recommended for additional work. A single
site (41WM283) is located about three miles northwest of the center of Taylor on the east
bank of the north fork of Mustang Creek at the former Wilson Springs community. This site
was recorded by Dan Prikryl and others in 1976 (TARL site files). It is described as an
Archaic occupation and quarry site.
Bradle et al. Surveyed the Brushy Creek Lake Park in 2001 and re-recorded sites
41WM544 and 41WM913 and increased the site boundaries for both. Sites 41WM544 and
41WM913 were both large lithic procurement sites. Site 41WM716, the historic
Champion Family Cemetery, was previously recorded and reported by Voellinger and
Smyth (1987) and is located in the adjacent Champion Park. Bradle and Bernhardt (2008)
surveyed the Phase III for the Brushy Creek Regional Trail on the south side of Brushy Creek.
No archaeological sites were identified during this survey due to extensive impacts noted.

FIELD METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, a background investigation was conducted. Site records
on the Texas Historical Commission Sites Atlas were checked for previously recorded
sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, site reports documenting work in
the region were examined for information concerning archaeological surveys and other
work relevant to the project area. The project was discussed with a representative of
the Williamson County Parks & Recreation Department to ensure that the field crew
was aware of the correct location of the project area.
There were no previously recorded sites within the project area. However, several
sites are located nearby but none were found to extend into the current project area. Those
sites included: 41WM716 located 039 kilometers to the east; 41WM715 located 0.39
kilometers to the southeast; 41WM545 located 0.48 kilometers to the southwest, where the
200 foot trail connector leads into Brushy Creek Lake Park. Site 41WM913 is located
nearby.

Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished using the pedestrian survey method at 10-meter
intervals. Surface visibility was excellent over much of the project area. In addition to
surface inspection, 20 shovel probes were excavated and determined that the project area
contained thin eckrant soils on top of limestone bedrock.

15

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
The site records at TARL revealed that no previously recorded s ites were
located within the project area. Large-scale projects such as Granger Reservoir, and
North Fork and South Fork Reservoirs have recorded the vast majority of sites in the
county.

Field Survey
The field survey did not identify any archaeological sites within the project area.
Overall, the area is very disturbed and contains Eckrant soils with surface bedrock
exposures (Figures 2 and 3). Twenty (20) shovel probes were excavated after a 100%
pedestrian survey was completed over the project area at 10-meter intervals. The project
area has been heavily utilized in the past due to historic farming, field clearing, historic
ranching, erosion, and road right-of-way activities.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The survey of the proposed Brushy Creek Trail Road Right-of-Way and
Champion Park Trail Connector in Williamson County, Texas performed for the
Williamson County Parks and Recreation Department did not identify any prehistoric
archaeological sites within the project area. American Archaeology Group, LLC
(AAG) recommends that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always
possible that buried cultural materials can be missed during any Phase I survey.
Therefore, should any sites be located during the construction of the trail, all work
within the site should cease until the situation can be evaluated by the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission, in consultation with American
Archaeology Group, LLC and the Williamson County Parks and Recreation Department.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN & SCOPE OF WORK
Records Check
Prior to entering the field, American Archaeology Group, LLC (AAG) will contact
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, the state
repository for site records on Texas, to determine if previously recorded sites are present
in the project area. This task may be conducted by a personal visit to TARL or by
telephone.
The library at AAG is very extensive, especially regarding reports for the project
area region, and much of the archival work can be accomplished in-house. Since AAG has
conducted work in the area, much of the background work has already been accomplished.
Permit Application
No fieldwork will commence until a permit from the Archeology Division (AD) of
the Texas Historical Commission has been issued. An application for an antiquities permit
will be submitted to AD-THC as soon as AAG receives Notice To Proceed. Normally,
AAG discusses the project with AD personnel before beginning any fieldwork. This is
done to ensure that both parties are in agreement as to the level of work required for this
project.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed utilizing the pedestrian
survey method supported by shovel testing and/or augering and examination of eroded and
disturbed areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Herbert G. Uecker
will act as the Principal Investigator. Shovel testing, augering, and backhoe trenching will
meet and exceed the Minimum Survey Standards For Texas established by the THC.
In areas of poor visibility, and environmental settings that have potential for buried
cultural materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of
high site probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill from shovel
tests will be screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually
excavated to sterile clay or bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, camera,
compass, and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches,
and archaeological sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried
sites, select areas in alluvial settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be
subjected to backhoe trenching. All sites identified in the project area will be mapped in
the field and plotted on a topographic map. Site locations will also be determined through
the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site will be recorded using the official
State of Texas Archeological Site Form. In no case will the survey crew work outside of
the project area as depicted on the project area map provided by the client.

26

Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered
through shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on a
field sack log. They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless a
petition to discard is prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has been
approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be delivered to
AD-THC and the client. AAG will maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms,
and any other records produced from the project deemed to be a work product.
