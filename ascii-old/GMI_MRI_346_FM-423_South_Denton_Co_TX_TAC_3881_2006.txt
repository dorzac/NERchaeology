MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing to widen Farm-to-Market Road
(FM) 423 from Stewarts Creek Road to SH 121 through The Colony in Denton County, Texas,
(CSJ 1567-02-020). This project would impact a 3.77-mile (mi; 6.06 kilometer [km]) length of
project corridor, including an existing right-of-way (ROW) of 90-250 feet (ft; 27.4-76.2 meters
[m]) wide. Within these limits, the ROW is mostly centered on the midline of the existing
roadway. A 500 ft (152 m) -wide Area of Potential Effects (APE) from the edge of the existing
highway ROW was also defined.
The primary contractor for the project, Carter & Burgess, contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc.
(GMI), of Plano, Texas, to conduct an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area. The
fieldwork was undertaken 25 August 2005, by GMI personnel, and focused on identifying and
shovel testing areas where intact archeological deposits were present within the proposed ROW.
As a result, no archeological deposits or sites were identified during the survey. No further
archeological investigations are recommended. All project notes, photographs, and other
documents will be housed at Texas Archeological Research Laboratory curation repository of the
University of Texas in Austin.

INTRODUCTION

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has proposed the expansion of FM 423 in
Denton County, Texas, from Stewarts Creek Road south to State Highway (SH) 121 (CSJ 156702-020). The intention is to upgrade the route to a six-and eight-lane divided urban arterial with
curbs, two-foot curb offsets, and no shoulders. The project would impact a 3.77-mi (6.06 km)
length of highway corridor, including an existing right-of-way (ROW) 90-250 ft (27.4-76.2 m)
wide from Stewarts Creek Road to SH121, entirely within the city limits of The Colony. Within
these limits, the ROW is mostly centered on the midline of the existing roadway. Though a
500 ft-wide (152 m) Area of Potential Effects (APE) from the edge of the existing highway ROW
was also defined, the archeological APE was restricted to the current ROW (Figure 1). Over 90
percent of the project area has been extensively impacted by recent urban development.
TxDOT is required by the Antiquities Code of Texas, the National Historic Preservation Act, as
amended, and the National Environmental Policy Act to assess the potential impact of the
proposed project on significant archeological or architectural properties that may be found within
the project area. Pursuant to these responsibilities, the primary contractor on this project, Carter
& Burgess, contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), to provide cultural resources services for
this project (GMI Project No. 30389.00.09). The state archeological site files at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, as well as the State Site Atlas and the
NRHP database, were consulted prior to conducting an archeological survey of the project area.
On August 25, 2005, both an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area and an examination
of the APEâs architectural resources were undertaken by Melissa M. Green (Project Archeologist)
of GMI. Duane E. Peter, also of GMI, served as the Principal Investigator.
The architectural survey consisted of the examination and photographing of all structures within
the APE, with the exception of a few tract homes and strip-mall structures, and is fully reported
under a different cover. The survey involved a pedestrian examination of the affected area, with
judgmental shovel testing in areas of poor ground surface visibility and perceived high
probability for archeological deposits. All notes, forms, photographs, and artifacts obtained from
the project are on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory curation repository of the
University of Texas in Austin.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
The project area is located along a north-south corridor stretching between the intersection of FM
423 and Stewarts Creek Road on the north, and the intersection of FM 423 and SH 121 on the
south. The project area is part of the Western Gulf Coast Plain, a physiographic province derived
from ancestral marine and deltaic processes of the Gulf of Mexico (Sellards et al. 1932). The
region is included in Blairâs (1950) Texan province, an intermediate zone between the forests of
the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and
Tamaulipan provinces. The Texan province is in essence a giant ecotone, in which some species
reach the limits of their ecological range (Yates and Ferring 1986:22).
The project area lies on the western border of a region mapped as Blackland Prairie, which is
characterized by gently rolling hills in dissected uplands, notable for their dark, calcareous,
shrink-swell black âgumboâ clay soils, and loamy to clayey alluvium in bottomlands. In this
case, the area is dissected by Panther Creek and two branches of Cottonwood Creek (see Figure
1). All three waterways cross the north-south project area on generally east-west bearings,
Panther Creek near the north end of the project area and the branches of Cottonwood Creek just
south of the center of the project area; they all drain ultimately into Lewisville Lake. Lewisville
Lake, originally named Lake Dallas and later known as Garza-Little Elm Reservoir, was
constructed on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River to control potential floodwaters originating from
the riverâs drainage basin (Handbook of Texas Online 2001).

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
Geologically, the project area is underlain by bands of the Upper Cretaceous-age Eagle Ford
formation, alternating with undifferentiated Quaternary alluvium and alluvial terraces. The Eagle
Ford is a dark, blue-gray marine shale and limestone that is, on average, 475 ft (145 m) thick.
The Quaternary deposits are typical mixes of sand, silt, clay, and gravel, and rarely exceed about
30 ft (10 m) in thickness (Bureau of Economic Geology 1967).

Eight specific soil units are mapped within the project area (Ford and Pauls 1980). They include:
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢

Branyan clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes
Branyan clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes
Ferris-Heiden clays, 5 to 15 percent slopes
Heiden clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes
Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes
Navo clay loam, 3 to 5 percent slopes
Ovan clay, frequently flooded
Vertel clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes

Branyan soils are deep, clayey Udic Pellusterts formed on calcareous sediments in upland
environments. Both Branyan clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes and Branyan clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes
occur within the project area. A typical Branyan clay pedon consists of a dark gray (10YR 4/1)
clay Ap horizon 6 in (15 cm) deep, underlain by an A1 horizon extending to 56 in (142 cm)
below surface that is also a dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay. Beneath this stratum is an AC horizon of
gray (10YR 5/1) clay that extends to 80 in (203 cm) bs (Ford and Pauls 1980:62).
Ferris-Heiden soils are represented in the project area by Ferris-Heiden clays, 5 to 15 percent
slopes. These are sloping to moderately steep, well-drained soils that occur on convex ridges and
sides of drainages. Approximately 50 percent of this complex is composed of Ferris soils, about
40 percent are Heiden soils, and the remaining 10 percent is similar soils. The soils are too
intricately mixed to be mapped as separate units. Ferris soils are deep, clayey soils formed in
calcareous clayey marine sediments; they are classified as Udorthentic Chromusterts. They
usually consist of 6 in (15 cm) of dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay at the surface, light olive
brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay from 6 to 43 in (15 to 109 cm), and olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) shaly clay with
strong brown mottles from 43 to 60 in (109 to 152 cm). Heiden series clays (including the
Heiden clay, 1-3 and 3-5 percent slopes found elsewhere in the project area) are deep, clayey soils
formed in clayey marine sediments. These Udic Chromusterts typically have a 19 in (48 cm)
surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay. This layer is underlain by 31 in (79 cm) of
grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay and 18 in (46 cm) of light olive brown clay (2.5Y 5/4). The lower
66 to 80 in (168 to 203 cm) is a mottled olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6), gray (N 6/0), and brownish
yellow (10YR 6/6) silty clay (Ford and Pauls 1980:65-66, 67-68).
Navo clay loam, 3 to 5 percent slopes, is a deep and gently sloping soil found along drainages and
low hills. The soil begins with a brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam 5 in (13 cm) deep underlain by a
yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay from 5-10 in (13-25 cm). Below this horizon is a mottled weak red
(2.5YR 4/2) and reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay from 10-22 in (25-56 cm) below surface.
Underlying this are a light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay with reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottling
from 22-48 in (25-122 cm), a light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay with strong brown (7/5YR
4/6) and gray (10YR 5/1) mottling from 48-72 in (122-183 cm), and finally a yellow (10YR 7/6)
clay with gray mottling from 72-80 in (183-203 cm) below surface (Ford and Pauls 1980:72-73).
Ovan clay, frequently flooded is a moderately well-drained, âdeep, nearly level soil found on the
flood plains of major streamsâ (Ford and Pauls 1980:35) and, along with Frio, Trinity, and
Seagoville clays, is one of the common components of local Trinity River flood plain sediments.
Ford and Pauls (1980:73) describe a typical pedon consisting of a grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay
Ap horizon 6 in (15 cm) thick overlying a thicker A11 horizon of grayish brown (2.5YR 5/2) clay
that extends to 25 in (64 cm) bs, and is distinguished from the above stratum by its blocky
6

structure. An A12 horizon consisting of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay extends to 66 in
(168 cm) before giving way to a grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay B horizon with a few brown
(10YR 4/3) mottles that goes to at least 80 in (203 cm) bs (Ford and Pauls 1980:35, 73).
Vertel clays consist of moderately deep, clayey soils that form in clayey shale, and are
represented in the project area by Vertel clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes. The upper 6 in (15 cm) of
these soils is grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, which lies above 27 in (69cm) of grayish brown
(2.5Y 5/2) clay with yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles. The bottom 33 in (84 cm) is
composed of stratified dark gray (10YR 4/1), yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), yellow (10 YR 8/6)
and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) very shaly clay (Ford and Pauls 1980: 79-80).

CLIMATE
Denton County is characterized as a warm, temperate, subtropical, humid climate that is generally
mild; periods of extremely hot and cold weather are usually limited in duration. Yearly rainfall is
evenly distributed, with the maximum rainfall occurring in April and May and the minimum in
August. Much of the rainfall occurs in the form of heavy thunderstorms, with a rapid runoff
allowing only limited absorption of water by the soil. An annual precipitation of 32-36 in (8194 cm) is evenly distributed throughout the year. Snowfall is rare, with an average of less than 1
in (2.5 cm) falling per year. The snowfall is generally present for less than one week. Prevailing
winds are southerly. Temperatures remain above 32Â°F (0Â°C) approximately 240 days each year
(Ford and Pauls 1980).

FLORA AND FAUNA
The project area nominally falls within Blairâs (1950:100â102) Texan biotic province, although
the biotic community in the region has undergone massive changes due to the expansion of the
Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area and the other nearby urban areas. The region as a whole is
characterized by high species diversity (Yates and Ferring 1986:22), and the Blackland Prairie
portion of the Texan biotic province consists of one of several tall-grass prairies prevalent in this
portion of Texas. Overstory, where it exists, consists of open stands of live oak (Quercus
fusiformus), with occasional intermixtures of southern red oak (Quercus falcata), willow oak
(Quercus phellos), and white oak (Quercus alba). Minor overstory species include black willow
(Salix nigra), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), red ash (Alphitonia excels), sycamore (Platanus
occidentalis), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), American elm (Ulmus americanus), bois dâarc
(Maclura pomifera), and mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Riparian environments often support
stands of pecan (Carya illinoinensis), plum (Prunus americana), hackberry (Celtis reticula),
black walnut (Juglans nigra), and similar trees, many of which would have been important food
resources in prehistoric times.
Understory consists mostly of perennial âbunchâ grasses such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium
scoparium), silver bluestem (Barthriochloa saccaroides), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis),
sideoats grama (B. curtipendula), hairy grama (B. hirsuta), and Indiangrass (Sorghastum
avenaceum), among others. Other common plant species in the region include several varieties of
briar (Rubus and Smilax sp.), rock cress (Arabis petiolaris), few-seed sedge (Carex oligocarpa),
marigold dogweed (Dyssodia tagetoides), Texas bluegrass (Poa arachnifera), and butterweed
(Senecio glabenus). Also present are the fragmented remains of the tall-grass prairie that once
dominated this region.
7

A wide variety of faunal species occurs in the project area; Blair (1950) cites a total of 57
mammalian species for the Texan biotic province alone. Also noted by Blair are 16 species of
lizard, one species of land turtle, the Carolina box turtle (Terrapene ornata), 36 species of snakes,
and 22 species of amphibians. Blair (1950) makes no mention of birds, although some 320 avian
species are known to exist in the region. Common bird species include mourning dove (Zenaida
macroura), bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), and turkey vulture (Cathartes aura).
Riparian environments are important habitats for such species as the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger),
opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), and turkey (Meleagris gallapavo silvestrous). Grasslands and
similar open habitats support the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cotton rat (Sigmodon
grammacus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus),
red fox (Canis rufus), and gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Aquatic environments provide
habitat for raccoons (Procyon lotor) and the occasional mink (Mustela vison) and muskrat
(Ondatra zibethicus); many species of fish, including catfish (Ictalurus and Pylodictus spp.),
sunfish (Lepomis spp.), and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens); various water snakes and
amphibians; migrating waterfowl; and shorebirds. Enterprising species that have colonized
human habitats include the black rat (Rattus rattus), house mouse (Mus musculus), and house
sparrow (Passer domesticus). Local species that are now considered threatened or endangered
include the mountain lion (Felis concolor), osprey (Pandion halietus), prairie falcon (Falco
mexicanus), and merlin (Falco columbiarus). Several species that may have historically
inhabited the area, such as pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) and bison (Bison bison),
are locally extinct, but predator species such as the coyote (Canis latrans) and the bobcat (Felis
rufus) are not uncommon (Blair 1950:100â102).

CULTURAL SETTING

CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

Prehistoric Period
Prikryl (1987) initially established a generalized prehistoric chronological framework of six
periods for the Upper Trinity River Basin. Investigations at Lewisville Lake in Denton County
(Lebo and Brown 1990) and Joe Pool Lake in Dallas County (Peter and McGregor 1988) later
refined this framework to a four-period model. The overall regional applicability of the phases
recognized at both lakes, however, remains to be demonstrated. The generalized chronology
presented here (Table 1) reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted from both sets of
investigations but is based primarily on the model provided by Peter and McGregor (1988). Lebo
and Brown (1990; Brown and Lebo 1991) present a chronology keyed specifically for Lewisville
Lake, but it closely follows the chronology proposed for Joe Pool. The chronology proposed by
Skinner and Baird (1985) for Lake Ray Roberts and surrounding Northcentral Texas is very
similar, except that it replaces âLate Prehistoricâ with âNeo-Americanâ and lacks a Protohistoric
stage.
Although a pre-Clovis occupation of the New World has long been suggested (e.g., Adovasio et
al. 1990; Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990; Meltzer 1989),
this evidence was not widely accepted until recent finds at the Monte Verde site in Chile, which
have yielded compelling evidence for human occupation of the New World prior to 12,000 years
ago (Collins 1997; Dillehay 1997). Within the southern United States, however, the evidence for
a pre-Clovis occupation remains disputed, and thus the Paleo-Indian period remains the earliest
recognized human habitation in Texas.
The Paleo-Indian occupation of the Upper Trinity River Basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts. The
Field Ranch site (Jensen 1968) along the upper Elm Fork is a primary example of typical site
contexts. Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks
in the Cross Timbers, and Dalton, Midland, San Patrice, Golondrina, and Scottsbluff points have
been recovered as well (Lebo and Brown 1990:16). The Lewisville site (41DN72; Crook and

Harris 1957, 1958, 1961) and the Aubrey site at Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring 1989, 2001) are the
best-known Paleo-Indian sites within the region. The Lewisville Lake site (41DN72) has been
controversial since its discovery, because the initial radiocarbon samples collected there provided
dates in the 37,000 B.P. range. Later work by Stanford (1981), however, resolved the controversy
concerning the date of the occupation. It appears that the presence of naturally occurring lignite,
as either a fuel or an inadvertent inclusion in these hearths, led to the early date being erroneously
attributed to the cultural remains. Consequently, the usually accepted date of 10,000â12,000
years ago for Clovis-period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human
occupation of Northcentral Texas.
Although settlement-subsistence strategy data for early occupants remain limited, excavations at
the Aubrey site (41DN479), a well-preserved Clovis-period site at Lake Ray Roberts northwest of
Lewisville Lake, indicate that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game animals alone; rather,
the entire range of prairie and forest species was used (Ferring 1989, 2001). Whether this more
generalized foraging subsistence pattern is characteristic of a Clovis adaptation in the Eastern
Woodlands and a subsistence pattern more focused on now-extinct big-game species is
characteristic of a Plains adaptation remains to be documented.
An understanding of the Archaic period in the upper Trinity River drainage is limited by the lack
of data from major excavations. This is particularly true for the Early and Middle Archaic
periods. Most evidence of an Archaic presence in Denton County takes the form of surface finds
of diagnostic projectile points, including the Gary, Elam, Edgewood, Ellis, Godley, and
Yarbrough styles. Skinner and Baird (1985) suggest that the general paucity of significant sites in
the vicinity of Lake Ray Roberts is due to the fact that the area was a marginal environment, a
habitat where food resources were scarce. In this model, Archaic and other populations occupied
the area only during specific seasons of the year, and then only long enough to collect and process
mast resourcesâspecifically, acorns. Investigations along the West Fork by others (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986) indicate that primary contexts for Early and Middle
Archaic sites will be found deeply buried within flood plain alluvium; a recent site investigated
on the Elm Fork in north Dallas County, 41DL391, suggest the same is true for that branch of the
river as well (Peter et al. 2002). Artifacts from these periods are found on terrace surfaces and are
frequently mixed with later materials. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic period (Crook
and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based upon mixed
materials from such terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer
recognized as acceptable for Northcentral Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates
and Ferring 1986).

10

Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at Lake Ray Roberts (Skinner
and Baird 1985) indicate that the Late Archaic period is characterized by assemblages left by
small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a site for a limited time period and
then moved to another location. These sites were apparently reoccupied numerous times on a
seasonal basis. Deer and numerous small mammals were the primary food resources. The
documentation of large pits associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland/Chambers
Creek drainage (Bruseth and Martin 1987) suggests that important sociopolitical changes may
have occurred during this time period. Unfortunately, the significance of these pits remains an
enigma despite their excellent documentation.
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the Upper Trinity River Basin is marked by the
initial appearance of arrow points. The date of A.D. 700 for this period is based upon dated
contexts to the west in the Brazos River drainage. Lynott (1977) suggests that the Late
Prehistoric period may be divided into an early and late phase, a division accepted by many
researchers (e.g., Lebo and Brown 1990; Skinner and Baird 1985). The early phase is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics, Scallorn and Alba arrow points, and a
continuation of the foraging subsistence system of the Late Archaic period. The late phase
reflects a Southern Plains influence with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the
Henrietta focus, various unstemmed triangular and side-notched points (e.g., Fresno, Harrell,
Washita), and the Perdiz point. Evidence of horticulture and the procurement of bison also
appear in sites of this period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Prikrylâs (1987)
more recent assessment of the Late Prehistoric period largely follows that of Lynott (1977).
Investigations of the Cobb-Pool site at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have resulted in
a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site yielded house structures,
roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates
from several features indicate that the site was occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth
century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddoan
occupation. Consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred during a
middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics were not introduced to
the region before this time.
Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive
change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however, recent
analysis of an elderly female Native American burial (site 41DL373; Peter and Clow 2000)
salvaged along Spring Creek in northeastern Dallas County also suggests maize consumption.
Radiocarbon dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155â1275, and a carbon
isotope ratio of -17.7â° suggests that maize was consumed, but did not form a major part of her
diet (Peter and Clow 2000). These indications of maize consumption contrast with a small
grouping of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369; Cliff et
al. 1996) in Dallas County. This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork of
the Trinity River), yielded remains of at least four individuals, radiocarbon-dated by bone
collagen to cal A.D. 1010â1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although shell
beads and a shell gorget were present. A carbon isotope ratio of -21.6â° suggests that the groupâs
diet was not high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given the slightly earlier date of the Harbor Pointe
burials compared to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is possible that maize agriculture was introduced
to the Dallas area ca. A.D. 1200. Conversely, this same evidence may indicate that different
groups in the Dallas area practiced divergent subsistence patterns.

Historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the Protohistoric period
in the Upper Trinity River Basin. Tonkawa, Wichita, Caddo, Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche all
likely traversed the area. Exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data, however,
are almost nonexistent. Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953) appear on a limited
number of sites, no Protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated, and characterizations of
the Native American adaptations during this time period are conjectural at best.

Historic Occupation/Utilization
The first presence of Europeans in Northcentral Texas may have occurred in 1542 when the
remnants of the de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered the area in an
attempt to find a land route to New Spain. Some researchers believe that the expedition crossed
Northcentral Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61), although others place the route much farther to
the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Chipman 1992; Hudson 1986; Schambach 1989;
Weber 1992). A consistent European presence in the region did not occur until the early 1700s,
when the Wichita moved from northern Oklahoma and reestablished large villages on the Red
River. French traders from Louisiana who had ties to the Wichita along the Arkansas River
retained their contacts and began to move west along the Red. The Spanish considered this
French incursion to be a threat to the security of New Spain, and they responded by redoubling
efforts to counterbalance the French influence with the Native Americans in East and
Northcentral Texas. Spanish efforts to control the Native American trade with the French
suffered a major set-back when the Wichita and their allied tribes attacked and sacked the
Spanish mission of San SabÃ¡ de la Santa Cruz in Menard County and repulsed a retaliatory
military expedition at the Wichita villages (later called âSpanish Fortâ because of Spanish
artifacts and fort remnants) on the Red River in 1758â1759. It has been argued that this defeat
put an end to Spanish military and missionary expansion to the north (Weddle 1964, 1965), and it
certainly gave the Wichita considerable autonomy from direct Spanish control in Northcentral
Texas. Nevertheless, the Spanish continued the attempts to curtail trade by controlling the French
traders coming into East Texas from Louisiana. These efforts persisted until 1763, when France
ceded Louisiana to Spain under the Treaty of Paris.
As settlers began to move into Texas, they remained under first Spanish and then Mexican
control, until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. For the most part, Northcentral Texas
was beyond the direct sphere of the war; it played out primarily in South and Central Texas. The
most significant change after independence involved decrees by President Mirabeau Lamar, the
second president of Texas, to make the settlers of the Texas Republic safe from "marauding"
Native Americans by adopting an Indian removal or extermination program, although active
efforts to drive off or kill off Native Americans from Texas had been under way for some time.
Subsequently, many native groups who used the Trinity River basin relocated north of the Red
River.
The first European Americans to colonize the region settled along the Trinity River and its
tributaries as the frontier grew westward. The earliest of these settlements, at present-day Pilot
Point and Little Elm, occurred near the southeastern corner of what later became Denton County
(Denton County History Page 2001). However, the area remained largely unsettled until 1841,
when pioneers (primarily from the upper southern states) were drawn by a land grant known as
the Peters Colony. The first land contract was obtained by William S. Peters and the Texian Land
and Emigration Company in 1841 to populate the newly formed Republic of Texas. Over time,
12

three additional land contracts expanded the Texian Land and Emigration Company (also referred
to as the âTexas Emigration and Land Companyâ), and eventually the land grant encompassed
most of Northcentral Texas, including present-day Denton County (then a part of Fannin County).
Farmers Branch, now in Dallas County, was the first community established within the Peters
Colony, although the headquarters was in Bridges Settlement, now known as Hebron (Lebo and
Brown 1990:63-64; Ogle 1977:1). Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846, and Denton
County was established by the state legislature that same year (Lebo 1990; Odom 2001a). The
population further increased during this time because the presence of federal troops promised
greater protection against potential raids by hostile Native Americans (Denton County History
Page 2001), who by then had begun to return to Texas in small numbers. Within the first few
years after Denton Countyâs creation, the county seat moved three times, with Denton eventually
becoming the permanent seat in 1856 (Lebo 1990; Odom 2001a).
Following the presidential election of 1860, Texas, in common with the rest of the South, began
to consider secession, in support of the retention of slavery as practiced by a few wealthy
slaveholders in the region. Denton County voted in favor of this action, and large numbers of
local men volunteered to serve with the Confederate Army. Although the fighting never reached
Northcentral Texas, the Civil War still inflicted hardships on the region (Works Projects
Administration [WPA] 1992:55â58). Because most able-bodied men were away fighting for the
Confederacy, many small towns and villages were left unprotected from and fearful of Native
American raids (Denton County History Page 2001). The result was an eastward retreat of the
frontier. Simultaneously, the region also experienced considerable immigration of Southerners
who were moving west to escape the warfare that ravaged the Deep South. The region gradually
became impoverished as the war progressed, when food and other commodities became
expensive and difficult to obtain (WPA 1992:55â58).
Although the region suffered economically in the aftermath of the Civil War, it was not as badly
affected as other areas of the former Confederacy. This greater economic vitality was fueled in
part by streams of immigrants from the rest of the country, who were hoping to make a fresh start
in the as-yet-unsettled West. Other elements in the economy included the nearby presence of one
of the cattle trails to Kansas, and Dallasâs role as a center for the buffalo hide market (WPA
1992:60â70). The presence of railroads in the area by the 1880s resulted in a shift in the local
economy. Prior to this time, most farming was subsistence-based, although cattle and horse
ranching had become an important industry. After the introduction of the railroad, cotton and
wheat production were the major forms of agriculture (Odom 2001a). Nevertheless, by 1910 over
60 percent of local farmers in Denton County were tenants (Green 1977:Table 8.16), many of
whom were trapped in a cycle of debt to the landowners (Ferring and Reese 1982). Rural
populations began to decline during the 1930s under the impetus of poor climatic conditions, hard
times, the decreased importance of cotton as a cash crop, and the increasing level of
mechanization in agriculture (Lebo 1995a).
Today, much of the Denton County economy is based on two large state-supported universities,
the University of North Texas and Texas Womanâs University, established in the city of Denton
near the turn of the twentieth century. In addition, several cities in Denton County, particularly in
the southeastern portion, have developed into suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area
(Odom 2001a). Agriculture, while still important to the region, is declining. Heavy industry,
however, has made an important contribution to the area economy in the last 30 years (Odom
2001b).

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Four major reports concerning the archeology of the Upper Trinity River Basin (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987, 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986) aptly summarize the history of
archeological investigations within the Upper Trinity drainage and the cultural-historical
framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archeologists have resulted in the recording of numerous sites, it is apparent that much research
remains to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988:27-29), most of the excavation efforts within
the Upper Trinity River Basin have focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm
Fork (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner et al. 1982) and the
East Fork (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966).
Field school excavations by the University of Texas at Arlington at the Northlake site on
Grapevine Creek were also reported in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975). More recent investigations
at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney et al. 1988; Peter and McGregor 1988) and the test excavations of the
River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al. 1987), have provided the initial assemblage data necessary
for an understanding of the adaptations along the West Fork of the Trinity River.
Extensive archeological investigations have been undertaken as a result of the construction of
Lewisville Lake (formerly known as Lake Dallas and Garza-Little Elm Reservoir) and Lake Ray
Roberts (formerly known as Aubrey Reservoir). Lewisville Lake has been expanded several
times as the population of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex has grown, with its earliest
incarnation, Lake Dallas, existing prior to 1936. Archeological investigations for Lewisville
Lake began in 1948 when the River Basin Survey (RBS) investigated the proposed reservoir area.
A total of 27 sites was found during this survey, 14 of which had been previously recorded by
members of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS; Stephenson 1949, 1950). Three sites,
Ledbetter (41DN5), Lake Dallas (41DN6), and Bob Pierce (41DN12), were tested by the RBS in
1951, although the results were never reported (Prikryl 1987). During and after the RBS
investigation, members of the DAS continued to investigate the Lewisville Lake area (Barber
1966, 1969; Harris 1950, 1951a, 1951b). The major result of this work was the discovery and
investigation of the Lewisville site (41DN72), a purported pre-Clovis occupation (Crook 1964;
Crook and Harris 1956, 1957, 1958, 1961). Radiocarbon dates of 37,000 B.P. created
considerable controversy in the archeological community until 1979-1980, when lowered lake
levels allowed reinvestigation of the site by the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1981). Further
enlargements of Lewisville Lake prompted surveys by the Richland Archeological Society in
1973 (Nunley 1973) and North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas
[UNT]) in 1986 (Lebo and Brown 1990). The latter survey was followed by test excavations
(Brown and Lebo 1991) and mitigation (Ferring and Yates 1998; Lebo 1995a) of selected sites.
Archeological investigations at Lake Ray Roberts began in the early 1970s with a survey
conducted by Southern Methodist University (Bousman and Verrett 1973), which recorded 26
sites (25 prehistoric, one historic). During 1980-1981, additional survey, as well as testing and
mitigation, was undertaken by Environmental Consultants, Inc. (ECI; Cliff et al. 1982), which
recorded 355 sites with 117 prehistoric components. Following the survey, additional
investigations were undertaken at 60 sites (Skinner et al. 1982), which were followed by intensive
excavation at 12 sites, oral interviews for 17 historic sites, and architectural recording at 13 sites
(Skinner and Baird 1985). Finally, in 1986 UNT began further survey, test excavations, and
mitigation efforts within the area to be impacted by construction of Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring
and Yates 1997; Lebo 1992, 1995b, 1996; Prikryl and Yates 1987).

14

Many small cultural resources management projects have been conducted in Denton County. The
volume of work done in the region makes it difficult for any listing to be comprehensive, but
most of the significant projects are included in the following discussion. In 1988, Martin
conducted a survey of proposed highway improvements along Interstate 35W in Denton and
Tarrant counties (Martin 1988). In 1989, UNT surveyed Hickory Creek Park for the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, resulting in the location of one historic site (Lebo 1989). In 1991, Mariah
Associates, Inc., did a reconnaissance of proposed sewer line improvements for the city of Argyle
(Kibler 1991). During late 1991, Peter and Austin performed a pedestrian survey of proposed
improvements at North Lakes Park in the city of Denton (Austin and Peter 1992). In 1992,
Corbin undertook a survey of the proposed Northpointe Park for the city of The Colony (Corbin
1992). During 1993, AR Consultants surveyed the proposed 28-acre Highland Village
Community Park (Skinner 1993). In the same year, Green and Peter surveyed the proposed South
Lakes Park for the city of Denton (Peter and Green 1993). In 1995, Ferring undertook a survey of
125 acres adjacent to the Lewisville Lake dam (Ferring 1995). Later that year, a pedestrian
survey of approximately 8 acres belonging to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers near Grapevine
Lake was conducted by SWCA, Inc. (Miller 1995). Also in 1995, the University of Texas at
Austin conducted a survey of an 800-acre tract along Timber Creek. One prehistoric site was
located but was considered to contain no significant deposits (Carpenter 1995). During late 1994
and early 1995, Hicks & Company performed a pedestrian survey for a 160-acre expansion of the
city of Denton landfill, resulting in the identification of one historic site (Treece et al. 1995). A
1996 pedestrian survey of the Arbor Hills Nature Preserve by AR Consultants also resulted in the
recordation of one historic site (Skinner and Whorton 1996). Again in 1996, AR Consultants
surveyed a waterline, the Prairie Creek Interceptor, for the city of Lewisville (Trask et al. 1996).
In the winter of 1996-1997, AR Consultants surveyed the proposed FM 2499 at Lewisville Lake
(Skinner 1997). Early in 1997, Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc., undertook the survey of the
Kirkwood Branch Interceptor waterline for the Trinity River Authority (Tate 1997). In 2001,
Geo-Marine, Inc. conducted archeological and geoarcheological investigations of 15 acres along
Timber Creek in Lewisville, Texas. Two prehistoric sites were identified, but they were
considered ineligible for inclusion in the NHRP (Cooper et al. 2001). Site 41DN518, a historic
farmstead, was independently reported by Galan in 2001. Construction of a housing development
destroyed any physical evidence of farm structures; the archival research phase of a subsequent
survey, however, turned up photographs depicting a corn crib and barn located on a narrow ridge
between seasonal tributaries. In February 2002, GMI conducted a survey of the proposed
location for a new wastewater treatment facility at Panther Creek, resulting in the identification of
two historic sites (41DN519 and 41DN520), both of which lie within .6 mi (1 km) of the project
area; neither was recommended for inclusion in the NRHP (TinÃ© 2002). In late 2002, the area
immediately northeast of the IH-35 crossing of the Elm Fork in Denton County was surveyed and
subjected to geoarcheological investigations by GMI, in preparation for the proposed T. C. Rice,
Jr., Athletic Complex; no cultural materials were identified, with the exception of two small
historic localities (Hunt et al. 2002). In 2003, GMI conducted a survey of 11.93 linear mi
(19.89 km) of Crosstex pipeline corridor located south of Denton. This survey, which crossed
Hickory Creek in numerous places, identified one prehistoric site and one historic locality. An
Ellis-type projectile point was recovered from the prehistoric site, which was located in a
disturbed context on an oil drill pad (Huhnke et al. 2003). In late 2003, GMI surveyed a 12.2 mi
(20.3-km) segment of US 380 from the Denton/Wise county line to its intersection at IH-35
(Huhnke 2004); no new cultural resources or historic properties were recorded as a result of this
survey. In February 2004, an adjoining 51.5 km (32.2 mi) corridor along Interstate 35E from IH
635 north to US 380 was surveyed by GMI, resulting in the discovery of three ineligible historic
sites (41DN525, 51DN526, and 41DN526) (Largent, Huhnke, and Wurtz 2004). In March 2004,
15

GMI undertook a survey and associated backhoe trenching in a 220-property at the northeastern
side of the intersection of the State Highway 121 bypass and IH 35E, immediately south of
Lewisville. A new site, 41DN52, was identified on the basis of materials recovered from seven
deep backhoe trenches, and appears to be quite extensive. As of this writing, its eligibility
remains undetermined (Largent, Lintz, and Huhnke 2004). Finally, in May 2004 GMI undertook
the cultural resources survey of FM 423 from US 380 to Stewarts Creek Road associated with the
road widening activities planned by TxDOT (Largent et al. 2005).
Three cultural resources surveys have covered portions of the current project area; however, none
of these surveys identified cultural materials in the project area. The first, the aforementioned
examination of 14,000 acres along the boundaries of Lake Lewisville, was conducted by North
Texas State University in the mid-to-late 1980s and intersected FM 423 along a minor branch of
Stewarts Creek, near the south end of the project area. It was this project that identified site
41DN408, a historic farmstead that lies about 0.8 km (0.5 mi) to the west of the project area
(Lebo and Brown 1990). In January 1996, TxDOT's Jerry Henderson surveyed the southern half
of the project area from the FM 423/FM 720 intersection to just north of Stewarts Creek, focusing
on the existing ROW and the flood plains of Cottonwood and Stewarts creeks. No cultural
materials were identified during this survey, the results of which evidently never saw formal
publication. In 2002, SWCA conducted a pedestrian survey of 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the same
stretch of road, encompassing both branches of Cottonwood Creek and the intervening properties
(Houk and Skoglund 2002).

CHAPTER 4
METHODOLOGY

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
The state archeological site files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
Austin, as well as the State Site Atlas and NRHP database, were consulted prior to conducting an
archeological survey of the project area. The Bureau of Economic Geology (Sherman Sheet,
1967) was consulted for geological information, and soil survey maps of Denton County (Carter
and Beck 1922; Ford and Pauls 1980) were examined for soils information and to determine the
locations of specific properties of interest. A literature review of the regionâs archeology,
prehistory, and history was conducted using sources located at GMI and in the primary author's
personal library. The results of this research were used to guide the field methods and to identify
areas with the greatest likelihood of retaining archeological deposits.

FIELDWORK
The archeological survey focused on identifying areas where intact deposits were present.
Fieldwork consisted of a visual inspection of the corridor, an evaluation of creek cutbanks and
other open cuts for buried cultural deposits, and the photodocumentation of structures located
within the APE. Stream crossings and other open cuts were evaluated for their potential for
containing deeply buried cultural deposits. When cutbanks were accessible and available, they
were visually examined for cultural remains, signs of disturbance, and soil context.
In addition to the pedestrian survey, a photographic record was made of potential historic
structures within the 500 ft (152 m) APE. Those considered of interest were photographed
individually; all recent tract housing and commercially developed properties such as strip malls
and convenience stores were either photographed collectively, or efforts were made to select and
photograph a representative structure. The Project Archeologist maintained a log of all
photographs taken during the project.

17

In addition, the Project Archeologist kept daily field notes detailing the investigations, field
observations, survey conditions, vegetation cover, and initial interpretations of the survey results.
Digital photographs were taken to record the general topography, vegetation, disturbances, and
urbanized development of the project area, as well as the activities related to the archeological
resources investigations.
Upon the completion of the project all artifacts, field forms, photographs, and results will be
housed at GMI.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

RESULTS OF THE ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
An examination of the state archeological site files at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, as well as the State Site Atlas online, revealed that two
archeological sites are recorded within a 1.6-km (1.0-mi) radius of the project area. These were
41DN408 and 41DN523, both of which represent the low-density remains of historic farmsteads.
None of the sites is mapped within the project area itself, or fall within the APE. Both sites have
been recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for recommendation as SALs.
An early soils map of Denton County (1918) and early USGS topographic maps were also
reviewed prior to the fieldwork as potential sources for historic-era sites and structures. The 1960
(photorevised 1987) topographic map was the only one that showed earlier structures. Five were
identified on the north end of the project area, four near Stewarts Creek and one on Stewards
Creek Road. Only one of those structures still stands. The rest have been razed and the areas on
which they stood, rebuilt or developed.
A review of the history of The Colony was also conducted. The Colony, located on the eastern
end of Lake Lewisville and on the site of the Hedgcoxe War of 1852 (an armed uprising of
colonists raided and burned the office of the Texas Emigration and Land Company protesting
what they viewed as an attempt by the land company to invalidate their land claims), was
established in 1973 as a housing development of suburban single family homes on 3,000 acres by
Fox and Jacobs, Inc. (The Handbook of Texas Online September 2, 2005). It was named for the
Petersâ Colony, the North Texas empresario grant given to William S. Peters by the Republic of
Texas in 1841. The project area remained rural until very recently. The northern city limits of
The Colony is marked by a sign at Stewarts Creek Road, the beginning of the project area.

RESULTS OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Much of the project area was not walked due to residential and commercial development, some
rather recent (Figure 2), or ongoing construction. What does not show up on this aerial is the
development that has occurred since 1995 on the south end of the project. Today this area is

A few areas in town are still undeveloped; however, those are few and far between. In those
areas, there are paved ditches, underground utilities, contouring for drainage from and along the
road ROW, and in one case, underground culverts of a small drainage (Figures 6 and 7). The
older part of town near Stewarts Creek (called Eastvale on the topo map) contains more
residential and commercial zones all the way to Stewarts Creek (Figures 8 and 9; top finger of
lake, see Figures 1 and 2). One structure in particular appeared to potentially be of NRHP
eligibility age (Figure 10), and was the only structure remaining of five noted on the USGS
topographic map that were standing in 1960 when the map was first printed. The form of this
masonry house differs from later, nearby houses in the use of a highly pitched roof with
intersecting gables. The house itself has an asymmetrical form. These features place it in an
earlier house tradition than the simple âranchâ type houses nearby, with their low-pitched, side
gabled roofs and simple, rectangular forms. However, this house does not meet criteria for
eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places due to a lack of material integrity.
The gable-end materials have either been covered over or replaced by modern sheet siding
material, with the end joints concealed by batten strips, all painted. One aluminum vent is visible
in the front gable. In the front el section, a non-historic, apparently sliding-type window has

replaced an earlier one of unknown form and material. This window is flanked by non-historic
decorative shutters. The corner porch has been altered using the same material found in the gable
ends, and seems to have been enclosed with large scale glazing. The front steps and railings are
wooden, non-historic. Roofing is either a synthetic or asphalt shingle of fairly recent vintage.
Overall, while the house may be 50 years old or older, it has lost materials and details important
to its original appearance and period of significance.
At the terrace edge just south of Stewarts Creek, and moving across Stewarts Creek, new
development has not yet encroached. On the west side of the road the shoulders again have been
steeply sculpted, and the drainage ditches lined with concrete (Figure 11), while the east side has
been leveled for a high power utility line corridor (Figure 12). North of Stewarts Creek
development is just recently beginning to emerge. The cities of The Colony, Frisco, and the
Town of Little Elm are beginning to merge at the same intersection (Lebanon/Boyd roads and FM
423) about 0.3 mile north of the Stewarts Creek Road. Other than the Blue Sky Sports Center just
north of the creek (Figure 13), and a small cluster of commercial enterprises (Figure 14) in the
southeast corner of Stewarts Creek Road and FM 423, no other development has occurred. This
is upland and the potential for archeology is extremely low. The shoulders of the road on the
west side are steep where the road was built up, and aerial lines follow the edges of the ROW.
Just north of Stewarts Creek on the east side of the ROW, large, deep trenches have been
excavated for installation of water main pipes. Permission was asked and granted to view the
stratigraphic profiles exposed in the trenches. One trench runs north along the edge of the road
ROW for about 0.1 mile, but the largest portion runs eastward away from the ROW to hook up
with a system near the Frisco line. The profiles exhibited no evidence of cultural remains or

materials (Figures 15 and 16). The small tributary to Stewarts Creek 0.2 mile south of the project
terminus at Stewarts Creek Road is part of the flood pool when the lake is up, but on this visit
was fairly dry (Figure 17). There were no creek banks to examine; the creek is not very large at
this point. The west side of the ROW where it flows under FM 423 has been covered with riprap
(Figure 18) and the shoulders are very steep, while the east side has been flattened and graveled
and used as a staging ground for construction, most likely road construction (Figure 19).

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of the archival review and the pedestrian/windshield survey, the project
corridor is considered to have either a low or no potential for intact archeological deposits. No
archeological remains or deposits were identified during the survey. The relative young age of
the City of The Colony and the extensive development that has occurred most recently has
impacted the project corridor further. The one pre-1960 structure remaining itself does not meet
the criteria for eligibility. For these reasons, no further archeological investigations are
recommended for the project area.

However, in the unlikely event that evidence of archeological deposits is encountered during
construction, work in the immediate area would immediately cease. TxDOT archeological staff
would be contacted in order to initiate accidental discovery procedures under the provisions of the
Programmatic Agreement (PA) between TxDOT, THC, FHWA, and the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation and the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and THC.
