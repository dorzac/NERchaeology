Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company cultural resource specialists completed an intensive, linear
100% pedestrian archeological survey and windshield historic architectural
property survey of approximately six miles of proposed new electrical
transmission lines and within a proposed substation outside of Godley, in
northwestern Johnson County, Texas. The project was sponsored by the Brazos
Electric Power Cooperative. Since the proposed transmission line project will
occur on privately held land with no State of Texas involvement, a Texas
Antiquities Code Permit was not required to conduct the survey, however,
surveyors adhered to the Texas Historical Commission’s minimum standards for
intensive linear survey. A total of 79 shovel tests were excavated along the
project alignment. One severely disturbed historic archeological site (41JN60)
was recorded during the survey. Through oral history investigation, the site was
identified as a trash dump from the early to mid-1950s.
This site is
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP). The windshield survey of historic-age resources 50-years of age
or older revealed no NRHP-listed properties in the project easement. Regulatory
clearance for the project to proceed is recommended through Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). All project related documents will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

Introduction and Executive Summary

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On behalf of the Brazos Electric Power Cooperative (BEPC), Hicks & Company
completed an intensive linear archeological survey and windshield survey of
historic-age standing structures along approximately six miles of proposed new
138 kV transmission lines and at a new 3.8-acre electrical substation west of
Godley, in northwestern Johnson County, Texas (Figure 1). Beginning at the
project’s southern terminus, the proposed transmission line ties into an existing
electrical line at a tap immediately south of County Road (CR) 1127, southwest
of Godley and proceeds generally northward, crossing Nolan Creek and State
Highway (SH) 171. From there the line continues north and west to its terminus
at the proposed Wildcat Substation immediately south of CR 916 approximately
one-quarter mile east of CR 913.
Throughout its length, the proposed
transmission line will require a 70-foot construction and maintenance easement.
Subsurface impacts associated with the proposed transmission line project will
be limited to pole locations, with only minor surficial impacts resulting from
vehicular traffic and brush clearing for the vast majority of the project
alignment. Approximately 3.8 acres of subsurface impacts are expected at the
proposed substation location while the transmission line’s easement totals
approximately 59 acres (totaling nearly 63 acres).
During the initial planning phases of the transmission line project, BEPC
coordinated with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) regarding its cultural
resource obligations (Letter – Jennifer Oshel to James Bruseth 8/30/06). A
response from the THC indicated that a cultural resource survey would likely be
required once a final route had been selected (Letter – William Martin to Jennifer
Oshel 9/5/06). The United States Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utility
Service (RUS; the Federal Agency overseeing this project and providing partial
funding) recommended that the corridor be assessed for “archeological and
historic building sites” prior to construction to fulfill its federal cultural resource
obligations (PUC 2008). As such, the cultural resource survey was conducted
for regulatory and management purposes under Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA). Since the proposed
transmission line project will occur on privately held land with no construction
impacts to lands owned by the State of Texas or any of its subdivisions, a Texas
Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit was not required to conduct the survey.
Nonetheless, the survey conformed to the THC’s minimum standards for linear
archeological survey. For linear projects, these standards stipulate at least 16
shovel tests per mile per 100 feet of easement width, or approximately one test
every 100 meters. Shovel tests were excavated to a depth of one meter, sterile
soils, or bedrock, whichever came first throughout the transmission line and at
the proposed substation location. Recent rains and agricultural activity afforded
excellent (80+%) surface visibility in some segments of the project corridor, while
other areas bore clear evidence of extensive disturbance. These portions of the
project alignment were visually inspected for surficial artifacts or features but
were not shovel tested. During the course of the survey, a total of 79 shovel
tests were excavated in support of the pedestrian investigation (75 tests along
the transmission line and four at the proposed Wildcat Substation at the
northern terminus).

Introduction and Executive Summary

One severely disturbed historic site was documented during the survey (Site
41JN60). The site is characterized as a diffuse to moderate scatter of a variety of
colored and clear glass, plastic, metal and occasional whiteware intermixed with
tire fragments and modern debris. No standing structures or yardscape features
were found in association with this scatter as the entire site area bore evidence
of significant modification through grading and/or bulldozing. The site was
determined, through conversation with the property’s former landowner, to be a
trash pile deposited at this location in the early-to-mid-1950s. Based on the
results of the archeological survey and oral historical corroboration, it is the
opinion of the Principal Investigator that Site 41JN60 is not eligible for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
No formal agreements exist between the THC and the RUS in regard to historic
properties under Section 106. A project architectural historian meeting the
Secretary of Interior’s Standards for professional qualifications conducted a
windshield survey of the project area for historic-age resources fifty years of age
or older (built prior to 1959) in the project easement and vicinity (within 2000
feet).
Although no historic-age resources are located within the project
easement, the alignment does pass nearby several historic-age resources. No
NRHP-listed or previously determined eligible properties are within the vicinity of
the project area. Due to visual intrusions from recent development, the
probability of rural historic landscapes being present in the project area is low.
Fieldwork for the archeological survey occurred from March 5th through 8th of
2008. The field crew for this portion of the survey consisted of Mason Miller
(Principal Investigator) and John Campbell. Kurt Korfmacher conducted the
windshield survey of historic-age standing structures on March 6th, 2008.
Richard Chambers of Brazos Electric provided valuable assistance and generally
facilitated the completion of the project. All project related documents and
materials will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
GEOLOGY
The current project area is situated entirely within the North-Central Plains
physiographic region of Texas. The North-Central Plains region is bounded on
the east by the Grand Prairie region, on the south by the Central Texas Uplift
and Edwards Plateau regions, and to the west by the High Plains region
(Wermund 1996).
The North-Central Plains region is characterized by entrenched floodplains and
plateaus, with a gently rolling terrain and elevations ranging from less than
1,000 feet on the east to about 2,000 feet at the caprock escarpment on the
west. The entire region developed geologically as an erosional surface on upper
Paleozoic formations (Wermund 1996; Johnson 1931). Topographically, the
region includes relatively flat prairie land to gently rolling, hilly terrain. The
areas of less relief in the region are underlain by shale bedrock where the areas
of more topographical relief are underlain by harder bedrock formations
(Wermund 1996).
The project corridor crosses three cretaceous age geologic formations including
(BEG 1972): Grayson Marl (Kgm), Pawpaw (Kpw) and Fort Worth Limestone
(Kwl). Grayson marl is characterized as a blocky, calcerous clay and marl with
limestone beds in the upper third of the column. This formation is measured at
60-100 feet thick. Pawpaw and Fort Worth Limestone formations are described
as varied combinations of calcerous clay and limestone with thickness ranging
from 10-35 feet.

SOILS
The project corridor crosses two main soil associations (SCS 1985): Aledo-Bolar
and Sanger-Slidell-Bolar soils.
Aledo-Bolar association soils (representing
approximately a third of the project corridor) are generally described as gently to
steeply sloping, very shallow to moderately deep, loamy soils located entirely on
uplands.
Sanger-Slidell-Bolar (composing approximately two-thirds of the
project corridor) are described as nearly level to sloping, moderately deep to deep
clayey and loamy soils located on uplands. Neither of these soil associations or
the varied specific soil contained therein bear a strong likelihood for containing
intact, buried cultural resources. Sites in these contexts are generally found on
the ground surface or immediately below.

VEGETATION
The project area is located within the Cross Timbers and Prairies ecological area
of Texas (Gould et al. 1960). The Cross Timbers and Prairies region is known for
rolling hills, with vegetation ranging from open prairie to savannah to dense
woodland (Correll and Johnston 1996). According to The Vegetation Types of
Texas (McMahan et al. 1984), the vegetation of the project area is mapped as
Crops. The Crops vegetation type is representative of cultivated cover crops or
row crops which provide food and/or fiber for either man or domestic animals.
This vegetation type also portrays grassland associated with crop rotations.

Environmental Setting

Grasses and other herbaceous species identified in the field include: coastal
bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), winter wheat (Triticum sp.), henbit (Lamium
amplexicaule), sow thistle (Sonchus asper), curly dock (Rumex crispus), western
pepperweed (Lepidium montanum), dropseed (Sporobolus sp.), cocklebur
(Xanthium strumarium), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), broomweed
(Xanthocephalum dracunculoides), lovegrass (Eragrostis sp.), Texas wintergrass
(Stipa leucotricha), threeawn (Aristida sp.), silver-leaf nightshade (Solanum
eleagnifolium), eryngo (Eryngium leavenworthii), Mexican hat (Ratibida
columnaris), and sunflowers (Helianthus sp.). Woody species observed in the
field include: hackberry (Celtis laevigata), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), prickly
pear (Opuntia sp.), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), black willow (Salix
nigra), Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), and sand plum (Prunus angustifolium);
these species were scattered and mainly restricted to fencelines.

WILDLIFE
The project area falls within the Texan biotic province, as delineated by Blair
(1950). The Texan biotic province is essentially an ecotone between the forested
areas of the eastern part of the state and the prairies of the west, and as such,
no endemic species of vertebrates are known from the area. Approximately 49
species of mammals, 23 species of amphibians, and 57 species of reptiles are
known to inhabit the province (Blair 1950). The Oaks and Prairies and Osage
Plains regions of Texas, as delineated by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
(Freeman 2003), are roughly equivalent to the Texan biotic province described
by Blair (1950). A total of 471 species of birds have been documented within the
Oaks and Prairies and adjacent Osage Plains regions of Texas (Freeman 2003).

LAND USE
Land use in the region focuses primarily on agricultural purposes (ranching and
farming). The electrical corridor mostly crosses open, grazing fields and plowed
hay and grass fields for feeding livestock. Recently, however, oil and gas
exploration, drilling, servicing, and gas processing are drastically transforming
the landscape with numerous pipelines, refineries and derricks located
throughout the project vicinity. In fact, the main drive for this proposed
transmission line project is to power a natural gas processing plant north of
Godley (BEPC 2006).

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The project area lies within the easternmost portion of the Plains Archeological
Planning Region as defined by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:4-5). The
previous designation for the region was defined by Suhm et al. (1954) as the
North-Central Texas cultural resource area. The cultural history of the project
area can be divided into four main chronological periods following the research
of Prikryl (1990): Paleoindian, Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, Late
Prehistoric I, Late Prehistoric II, and Historic period. Prikryl’s (1990) exhaustive
synthesis of the prehistory of the region, through the Trinity River Basin
investigations along Elm Fork is the major source for approaching a working
model of the region’s cultural background.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Paleoindian Period (ca. pre 8500 B.P.)
The Paleoindian period extended from the terminal Pleistocene into the Holocene
and was characterized by a low population base of wide-ranging nomadic bands.
Subsistence patterns during this period may best be described as a generalized
hunting and gathering economy, with a combination of big-game and smaller
faunal hunting as well as the collecting of plants (Prikryl 1990). Evidence has
been recovered for Paleoindian occupation in the North-Central Texas area,
however, most of the evidence has been recovered from surface artifact finds,
providing little information about specifics of daily life during this period. The
Paleoindian cultures are distinguished by their distinctive lithic technology,
evidenced through the finely chipped, sometimes fluted lanceolate projectile
points.

Archaic Period (8500 – 1250 B.P.)
The Archaic period is divided into three temporal subcategories (Prikryl 1990):
Early Archaic (8500-6000 B.P.), Middle Archaic (6000-3500 B.P.), and Late
Archaic (3500 – 1250 B.P.). The Early Archaic most likely coexisted with the
long warm glacial warming trends marking the end of the Pleistocene. Although
no discrete Early Archaic components have been isolated in the region, the
projectile points from this period mirror the Paleoindian lack of regionalization
and are mostly made from non-local cherts (Prikryl 1990:69). Additionally,
similar to the Paleoindian period, most of the known sites of the Early Archaic
period are located on terraces, potentially reflecting a lack of floodplain
investigations.
While the Early Archaic period retained many technological similarities to the
Paleoindian period, the Middle Archaic hunter-gatherers are increasingly
distinctive. In this region, the Carrollton Focus, as originally defined by Crook
and Harris (1952), encompasses both of these periods. Subsequent
investigations have shown that it may be possible to identify distinct Early and
Middle Archaic periods of surrounding areas (Prickryl 1990). In general, this
Early to Middle Holocene period is characterized as warm and dry initially and
becoming wetter around 4500 B.P. when the Cross Timbers are thought to have

Cultural Background

first developed (Prikryl 1990). The projectile points seem to mirror a cultural
change as well, by becoming more regionalized toward the end of the period.
The Late Archaic in this region has generally been associated with the Elam
Focus (Crook and Harris 1952). This period, which shows strong affiliations
with cultural traditions to the east and north, is marked by an increase in site
density which may indicate increased population. An increase in plant species
due to wetter climate conditions may have encouraged further regionalization
during this period and the slight decrease in the overall number of lithic
artifacts made from chert may evidence this trend as well (Prickryl 1990).

Late Prehistoric Period (1250 – 250 B.P.)
The Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases, representing
early and late transitional periods: Late Prehistoric I (1250 – 750 B.P.) and Late
Prehistoric II (750-250 B.P.). The Late Prehistoric period represents a significant
change from the earlier patterns in the region. Overall, it is distinguished by the
introduction of new technologies, including the bow and arrow along with the
emergence of ceramics, as well as potentially new adaptive strategies such as
agriculture. The Late Prehistoric I period in this region is characterized by
projectile points (Scallorn, Steiner, and Catahoula), which were more commonly
made from quartzite instead of chert during the early stages of this period
(Prickryl 1990:77-79).
The Late Prehistoric II may represent the actual
introduction of peoples following a southward extension of bison range in parts
of Texas, along with considerable influence from the more settled agricultural
peoples to the north and east. Various unstemmed triangular arrow points
representative of this period are Maud, Perdiz, Fresno, Washita and Harrell.

Historic Period
Although the Historic period theoretically begins in Texas with Cabeza de Vaca
and survivors of the Narvaez expedition landing on the Texas coast in 1528, the
initial period of European contact in this current regional study is not well
documented. While the Moscoso expedition may have traveled through the area
in 1542, the first recorded incursion into the region by a white explorer came in
1788, when Pedro Vial passed through the area on his way from Santa Fe to
Natchitoches, Louisiana. Explorers and settlers ventured into the region more
frequently with time until the 1840s when most of the county was sparsely
occupied by the Peters and Mercer colonies (Elam 2008). Native American
groups in the area at this time include Tonkawa, Kickapoo, Anadarko, Caddo
and Waco. Although native regional groups such as the Wichita and the Waco
survived as relatively cohesive cultural entities until well into the nineteenth
century, the advent of European settlers may have resulted in the disappearance
or heavy alteration of the cultural patterns of many groups (Anthony and Brown
1994).
Throughout its history Johnson County has been primarily an agricultural area
with cotton and livestock production acting as the primary income sources for
the residents (Elam 2008). The first permanent settlements in what is now
Johnson County appeared around 1850. Between 1854 and 1867, the county
seat changed three times, with the current location at Cleburne the final
destination. In 1881, the county assumed its current boundaries (Elam 2008).

Cultural Background

Agriculture drove the economy of the county for most of its history. Prior to the
Civil War, livestock and corn were the primary industry and crop, respectively.
With very few slaves present, a plantation system never developed in the county.
After Reconstruction, cotton slowly overtook corn as the primary crop while
livestock remained strong. Land ownership was a benefit enjoyed by few,
however; by 1900 nearly fifty percent of farmers were sharecroppers or tenant
farmers, renting the land they tilled (Elam 2008).
Although railroads arrived in the county very early in 1854, they had no real
impact until 1881 when a rail line connected Cleburne to Dallas, and the Gulf,
Colorado, and Santa Fe (GC&SF) was completed through the county. In 1886,
R. B. Godley donated land for a townsite and right-of-way to the GC&SF; a post
office opened in Godley two years later (Hart 2008). The GC&SF was eventually
connected to the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad and in 1898 the
railroad opened up repair facilities in Cleburne, boosting the economy (Elam
2008). Godley served as a rail shipping point for local farmers.
The county population peaked in 1920, then slowly declined over the next
several decades. By 1924, an improved road paved with gravel connected
Godley to Cleburne, which became part of State Highway 171 in 1939 (Humble
Oil, 1924). In the second half of the twentieth century, northern county towns
such as Burleson became bedroom communities for the Dallas-Fort Worth
metroplex and growth accelerated (Elam 2008). Agricultural communities such
as Godley, however, remained relatively stable and continued with a rural
economy and lifestyle. Recent oil and natural gas development in the Godley
vicinity has provided a boost to the local economy.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Two archeological surveys for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
overlap or pass immediately adjacent to the current survey area. One survey
runs east-west, presumably along a then-proposed electrical transmission line.
This survey crosses the Wildcat transmission line near its southern terminus.
The second survey passes immediately north and east of the current study
corridor near the Wildcat substation. Both surveys were conducted by Horizon
Environmental in 2004, with neither recording archeological sites in the current
project vicinity. There are no recorded archeological sites within the current
study area. The closest site, 41JN3, is located nearly four kilometers east of the
project’s approximate midpoint. Site density throughout the county is generally
very low with only 60 sites recorded county-wide. This apparent low site density
is more likely the result of limited cultural resource survey rather than a lack of
actual sites in the region.
Johnson County contains four NRHP-listed historic properties; three in
Cleburne and one in Meredith, none of which are near the project area.

Results of Field Investigations

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists intensively surveyed BEPC’s proposed six-mile
Wildcat transmission line and 3.8-acre substation. Field investigations indicate
that virtually the entire project corridor passes through upland settings with
minimal potential for significant site deposition or preservation.
Following the THC’s minimum standards for intensive linear archeological
survey, archeologists conducted a 100% pedestrian survey supplemented with
shovel testing.
Archeologists walked the entire extent of the proposed
transmission line and substation and examined the ground surface for historic
structures and surface scatters of prehistoric and historic artifacts.
Archeologists also documented locations within the easement that are disturbed
by modern or natural processes. Shovel tests were excavated at 100-meter
intervals to test for subsurface cultural deposits in areas that lacked good
surface visibility (<30% surface visibility) or did not contain overt evidence of
disturbance. The majority of the study corridor did require shovel testing to
fully assess the potential for historic properties in the area. Shovel tests were
excavated to a depth of one meter below ground surface, to clearly culturallysterile soils, or to bedrock (whichever came first). Due to the prevailing dense,
upland soils encountered within the study area, shovel tests generally
terminated between 50 and 70 centimeters below ground surface (cmbs).
Whenever possible, excavated soil was passed through ¼-inch wire mesh screen,
however extensive local rain, sleet, and snow produced wet, sticky clay that did
not screen well. In instances where clays did not screen well, the matrix was
hand-sorted or trowelled in an effort to isolate cultural materials. Shovel tests
were recorded on standardized forms and each shovel test location was recorded
using a hand-held Trimble GPS unit (which was post-processed for sub-meter
point accuracy) and manually plotted on project maps.
An architectural historian conducted a windshield survey of the project area.
The proposed alignment was viewed from public right-of-way along existing
roads, and personnel walked a short portion of the easement in the north
segment. The windshield survey sought out historic-age resources appearing to
be fifty years of age or older within 2,000 feet of the project easement.
Properties of interest were photographed, along with examples of typical
viewsheds from public right-of-way, facing the proposed alignment. Project
historians did not evaluate any historic-age resources for NRHP eligibility during
the course of the survey.
For ease of discussion, description of the proposed transmission line’s survey
has been divided into two segments, bisected by SH 171, while survey of the
proposed electrical substation will be recounted in a separate section. Finally,
Site 41JN60 will be described briefly in the final segment of this chapter.

WILDCAT TRANSMISSION LINE SOUTH OF SH 171
(~3.5 MILES, 46 NEGATIVE SHOVEL TESTS)
The southern segment of the survey extends south from SH 171 to just south of
CR 1127 where the line will tap into an existing transmission line. The proposed
transmission line only traverses three streams, West Nolan Creek and two of its
intermittent tributaries, over the entirety of the southern segment (Plates 1-2).

Results of Field Investigations

All three of these streams are located in the northern portion of the southern
segment. Overall, the southern segment consists of high, level to gently rolling
uplands. Immediately south of SH 171 is West Nolan Creek. This area has a
minor floodplain with two stream channels and a stock tank that lies directly
beneath the proposed line’s route. This tank (between Shovel Tests MM36 and
JC42) has likely severely modified much of the surrounding area. At the time of
the survey this area was partially flooded and extremely swampy. Due to the
swampy conditions and degree of disturbance at this location, subsurface test
frequency was reduced. Moving south from West Nolan Creek the topography
rises quickly into the high, rolling uplands. The majority of the southern
segment is currently used as pasture with generally poor surface visibility
(Figure 2). This segment has minimal disturbance from pipelines and no
evidence of mud laying (see mud laying definition below). One small segment of
the transmission corridor, between Shovel Tests JC25 and JC37, bore evidence
of severe disturbance, crossing several buried utility lines with abundant
indications of further landform modification. Two additional tanks along the
southern segments (between Shovel Tests MM25 and JC28 and MM10 and
JC22) were also severely disturbed. However, this proved more the exception
than the norm. This area was photographically recorded with no subsurface
excavation (Figure 3).
In all non-disturbed areas with less than 30 percent surface visibility,
archeologists excavated shovel tests at the standard 100-meter interval.
Archeologists excavated a total of 46 shovel tests along the southern half of the
transmission line (Shovel Tests JC12-14, 18-20, 22-37, 40-42, MM8-10, 16-17,
20-32, 35-37; Plates 1-2). Soils located in the high uplands in the southern
segment were fairly ubiquitous, exhibiting primarily a silty clay loam texture. A
typical deep upland shovel test in the southern segment is Shovel Test JC36
with an upper zone of 10YR4/3 silty clay loam between 0 and 15 centimeters
overlying 10YR5/4 silty clay loam between 15 and 51 centimeters. The final
zone was between 51 and 60 centimeters and was identical to the previous zone
except for a noticeable increase in calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Some of the
shovel tests in upland areas within the southern survey segment were shallow,
exposing dense gravels and cobbles or bedrock within the first 15 centimeters.
The northern half of the southern segment exhibited lower upland ridges
descending into West Nolan Creek and two of its tributaries. These areas were
immediately north and south of CR 1128. Soils in this area were darker, deeper,
and more clayey. Typical shovel tests in this portion of the project area
exhibited 10YR3/1 silty clay sediments becoming more calcareous with depth.

Historic-Age Properties South of SH 171
Two historic-age properties were noted within 2,000 feet of the proposed
alignment in the southern segment. The property at 8905 CR 1128 (Site 1) is a
farmstead with a circa 1920 residence and several outbuildings of varying ages
(Figures 4 and 5). The main house is a front gabled, modified L-plan with a
half-length porch, a mix of wood-sash and metal frame windows, and asbestos
siding. A large modern addition extends west from the back. The outbuildings
are a mix of modern steel barns, and wood sided storage sheds and barns. A
secondary modern residence is also located on the property. The proposed
alignment runs adjacent to the parcel, following property boundaries. The core
buildings of the property are approximately 1000 feet from the proposed
easement, as well as from public right-of-way. The property at 8228 CR 1128
(Site 2) is a circa 1920 farmhouse with a weatherboard storage barn (Figure 6).
The house is a modified L-plan with a small inset porch, a mix of wood-sash and
metal frame windows, and small inset porch. Salt box additions are apparent on
the east side, a dormer added to the roof, and a large addition has been
connected to the original building on the west side. This property is also
approximately 1,000 feet from the proposed alignment.

WILDCAT TRANSMISSION LINE NORTH OF SH 171
(~3 MILES, 29 NEGATIVE SHOVEL TESTS, SITE 41JN60)
Moving north of SH 171, the study corridor essentially climbs a shallow
northward-rising hill then remains in this upland setting through to the line’s
northern terminus. The line skirts the eastern edge of the western terrace of the
Nolan River through the majority of its length (Plates 3-4). The topography for
this survey segment was open and flat to slightly rolling. Surveyors crossed
several Nolan River tributaries along this segment, however all were very minor
and almost imperceptible. Nearest SH 171, the transmission line corridor was
covered with a dense population of broomweed and grasses that stood knee- to
waist-high, however, once the line reached the upland setting, the vegetation
transitioned to short, generally cultivated grasses (Figure 7).
Recent
agricultural activity followed by spring rains had created excellent surface
visibility conditions for a sizable portion of this segment (particularly in the
northern third) where surface visibility was approximated at greater than 80
percent (Figure 8). Recent rains had also left large portions of these cleared,
planted areas with shallow to moderately-deep standing water and mud, making
shovel testing likewise impossible.
These areas were intensively visually
inspected for surficial cultural materials.
While surveyors did note an
abundance of surface limestone and quartzite gravels and cobbles in much of
these planted areas (tilled up during agricultural activity), no artifacts or
features were observed.

Figure 8: Plowed area in northern segment with high ground surface visibility.
This segment also bore much more modern disturbance than the segment to the
south. Approximately a quarter to a third of the transmission line corridor
north of SH 171 (particularly near the center of the segment) was severely
modified by either drainage ditch modification (between Shovel Tests MM4 and
JC4), tank construction (adjacent to JC6), buried pipelines (paralleling the
eastern ROW edge of the transmission line between Shovel Tests MM5 and JC9,
and crossing the line at Shovel Test JC6) and mud laying. This last modification
was described as the process of gas drilling companies paying landowners by the
acre to deposit the watery, muddy byproducts of deep drilling on their land
(Figure 9). Landowners claim that the slurry makes excellent fertilizer and the
introduced mud is plowed and tilled into the existing soil (Richard Chambers,
Personal Communication). This process would severely modify the existing
sediments beneath the transmission line, particularly in the upper portions
where archeological materials would likely be located in these upland contexts.
With the abundance of disturbance noted, these areas were not shovel tested,
but photographically documented and recorded on field maps.

Results of Field Investigations

Figure 9: Evidence of mud laying and flooding in upland fields in the northern segment.
In all non-disturbed areas with less than 30 percent surface visibility,
archeologists excavated shovel tests at the standard interval. Archeologists
excavated a total of 29 shovel tests along the northern half of the transmission
line (Shovel Tests JC1-11, 15-17, 21, MM1-7, 11-15, 18-19; Plates 3-4). Soils
noted near the southern end of the segment were similar to those observed in
the southern segment. Shovel Test MM11 is typical of this portion of the
segment with 27 centimeters of 10YR3/1 dark brown compact clay followed by
34 centimeters of 10YR3/3 brown dense, very hard clay with CaCO3 inclusions
in the lower five centimeters. Farther north, on the higher landform, soils were
shallower with bedrock gravels and cobbles routinely encountered between 15
(JC16) and 42 (JC17) cmbs, with the majority contacting gravels around 30
cmbs (JC1-2, MM1-2, 13-15). Closer to the Nolan River, soils were slightly
deeper, though still clearly of upland, sterile derivation. Typical sediments of
this area were found in Shovel Test JC3, which contained 16 centimeters of
10YR3/2 compact, silty clay followed by 2.5Y6/4 light, yellowish brown clay
subsoil. This test was terminated at 50 centimeters in clearly sterile sediments.
None of the shovel tests excavated along the northern segment were positive for
cultural materials or features, however, archeologists did record Historic Site
41JN60 near the segment’s midpoint (see site discussion below).

Historic-Age Properties North of SH 171
Four historic-age properties were noted within 2,000 feet of the proposed
alignment in the northern segment. The property at 9453 CR 913 (Site 3) is a
farm complex composed of several circa 1930 houses and accompanying
outbuildings (Figures 10 and 11). The houses are front-gabled bungalows with
wood-sash and metal frame windows. Some have exposed rafter tails under
shallow eaves. Outbuildings are a mix of barns and storage sheds with either
corrugated metal or wood siding. Some buildings are barely visible from public
right-of-way. The property, identified as Land Farms by signage, is one of

several injunction properties in the project area; gaining additional rights-ofentry to examine all buildings is likely unfeasible. The proposed alignment cuts
across the east end of the parcel but does not directly impact any buildings.

Results of Field Investigations

Along CR 913 are several historic-age resources, although most are 2,500 feet
beyond the proposed alignment or more. The property at 10537 CR 913 (Site 4)
is a circa 1920 modified L-plan residence with one-over-one-light wood sash
windows, horizontal wood siding, inset porch, and saltbox addition on the back
(Figure 12). Several windows are boarded up with plywood, and the property
appears to be vacant. Two dairy farms of indeterminate age are immediately
west of the alignment, which skirts their respective parcels. Older dairy-related
buildings are located next door to 10537 CR 913, but do not appear to be in use.
11001 CR 913 (Site 5) is a circa 1915 farmhouse with a wood barn. The house
is a four-square with pyramidal roof, wood-sash windows, horizontal siding, and
inset porch (Figure 13). A minor addition has been built on to the rear of the
building. The wood frame barn has vertical wood plank siding, double doors,
hay loft, and a shed addition on the north side (Figure 14). This property is
approximately 1200 feet west of the proposed alignment, across CR 913.

The viewshed of the northern segment is relatively rural with denser pockets and
stretches of modern development than the southern segment, particularly north
of SH 171. At the north terminus of the project area is a large oil and natural
gas facility, along with a cell tower (Figure 15). The windshield survey identified
no rural historic landscapes in the northern segment.

WILDCAT SUBSTATION
Located at the project’s northern terminus, immediately west of a large, new
natural gas processing plant (Figure 16), the proposed Wildcat Substation
occupies a total area of approximately 3.8 acres (Plate 4). The site is situated
on a flat upland northwest of the Nolan River’s headwater, immediately south of
CR 916. The proposed substation site was immediately determined to be
severely disturbed through most of the central and northeastern portions of its
footprint. Slabs from a house and garage (both likely post-dating the 1950s)
that had very recently been removed occupied the majority of the center of the
study segment while the house’s driveway occupied most of the northeastern
corner (Figure 17).
Evidence of significant grading and ground leveling
(potentially a byproduct of the house demolition/removal process) were also
prevalent surrounding the former house site. The southern boundary of the
substation site was occupied by a gravel construction pad that at the time of
survey held a large natural gas tank and crane while the northern boundary was
peppered with buried utility markers (Figure 18). Overall, the majority of the
proposed substation site was too highly disturbed to bear any potential for
containing historic properties and was only briefly photographically
documented. Only a small “C”-shaped portion of the substation site along the
southern, western, and northern periphery lacked evidence of disturbance and
was thus intensively shovel tested.

Results of Field Investigations

Figure 18: Additional disturbance at the proposed Wildcat Substation Site.
Archeologists excavated a total of four shovel tests in the least disturbed
portions of the proposed substation area (Shovel Tests JC38-39, MM33-34). At
each shovel test location the ground surface was covered with a thin film of ice,
frozen from recent rains, and a dense mat of grass. Surface visibility was
generally very low (<5%). Soils to the south and west in the substation area
were dense upland clays and silty clays typical of much of the transmission line
to the south. Shovel Test JC38, typical of this area, contained 40 centimeters of
10YR3/1 dense silty clay that shifted to 10YR4/1 compact clay with a distinct
presence of CaCO3, increasing with depth. This test terminated at 52 cmbs in
sterile, upland subsoil. Subsurface evidence of disturbance was noted in Shovel
Test MM34, dug along the northern periphery. In this test, soils were generally
similar in color and composition, but contained a uniform (5-10%) inclusion of
limestone gravels from the surface through the test’s terminus at 43
centimeters. This test terminated in likely disturbed sediments at a dense
limestone gravel lens. None of the shovel tests excavated contained any cultural
materials or evidence of historic or prehistoric activity in the area.
Overall, the proposed substation site lacked any potential for containing cultural
resources. This conclusion was reached through abundant evidence of surficial
and subsurface disturbance throughout the central and northern portions of the
study area and a lack of cultural resources or evidence thereof within any of the
shovel tests dug in less disturbed contexts. Construction of the proposed
substation will not likely impact any historic properties.

Historic-Age Properties at the Proposed Wildcat Substation
No historic-age resources were noted within 2000 feet of the Wildcat substation
outside of the property at 11001 CR 913 (Site 5) mentioned previously. Several
farmsteads dating to the early 1960s are nearby. The area around the proposed
substation is dominated by an oil and natural gas storage and refinery complex.

SITE 41JN60
Site 41JN60 consists of a diffuse scatter of historic artifacts bisected by an
ephemeral stream. Identified on the surface, the site is located in a pasture near
the intersection of several pipelines and two fences near the center of the
northern survey segment (Figures 19 and 20). Grasses are short at the site
affording 20 to 100 percent ground surface visibility. The only feature on the
site consists of a low mounded area that is likely the remains of a push pile
created by heavy machinery. Four shovel tests were excavated on the site, two
of which exhibited heavily disturbed soils as a result of the pipeline installation.
All four shovel tests were negative for cultural material. Although the mounded
area appeared to be a push pile, a shovel test in its center revealed no evidence
of disturbance or cultural material. The artifacts identified at the site (all visible
on the ground surface) consisted of clear, brown, blue, and milk glass, metal, a
beer can, plastic, a tire, and burned limestone (Figures 21 and 22). One of the
pieces of milk glass has “NADINO… A COMP… NATIO… PARIS…” printed on its
base, but the investigators were unable to determine a manufacturer or its
origin. This piece is likely the base of a cosmetics jar (Figure 22). One of the
blue glass fragments was the cobalt blue base of a Noxzema jar. This cosmetic
product was invented in Baltimore in 1914 but was not nationally distributed
until 1938 (Proctor & Gamble 2008). Unless the depositors of this artifact had
taken a trip to the Chesapeake Bay area, this site most likely post-dates the late
1930s. The artifacts occur in a fairly low density except within and along the
ephemeral drainage, where they are eroding to the east and outside of the
survey area.
Given the overall paucity of artifacts and the lack of a substantive amount of
architectural debris, it was believed that Site 41JN60 was likely a historic trash
scatter, rather than a residence. In addition, investigators examined the 1887
USGS Granbury Sheet (USGS 1887), the 1936 General Highway Map for
Johnson County (Texas State Highway Department 1936), and the current 1985
7.5’ USGS Godley quadrangle and found no structures in the location or vicinity
of Site 41JN60 on any of these maps. According to Larry “Kirk” Carrell, a longtime resident of the property and former landowner, this site was created by his
father in the early to mid-1950s. Mr. Carrell recalls that his father, William
Lewis Carrell, allowed the local Godley Boy Scout Troop to collect the town’s
remnants from trash burning and deposit them in a ditch that he dug at this
location. In 1953 (or 1954) Mr. Carrell said that his father covered over the
collected trash with dirt when he used a backhoe to dig out the water tank that
now lies just to the south of the site (Larry Carrell, Personal Communication
March 27, 2008; Plate 4). Mr. Carrell mentioned that as a child he would
regularly go to this location and pick through the trash for toys and other items
to play with. The elder Mr. Carrell is not listed in the Handbook of Texas online
and is not considered a person of local significance. Based on the low density of
cultural material, a lack of intact subsurface deposits of features, and poor site

integrity it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that Site 41JN60 is not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Conclusion and Recommendations

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Brazos Electric Power Cooperative, Hicks & Company cultural
resource specialists have completed a linear, 100% pedestrian archeological
survey and windshield historical architectural survey along approximately six
miles of proposed new electrical transmission lines and at a proposed new 3.8acre electrical substation west of the Town of Godly, in northwestern Johnson
County, Texas.
With a 70-foot overall easement width, archeologists
investigated approximately 63 total acres (59 acres along the transmission line
and the 3.8 -acre substation site). A total of 79 shovel tests were excavated in
completion of the survey (75 along the transmission line and four at the Wildcat
Substation).
Although much of the project corridor traverses undeveloped
areas that have been disturbed only by agricultural practices, the entirety of the
easement crosses ancient upland surfaces considered to have low probability to
contain significant, buried archeological deposits.
One severely disturbed historic site (41JN60) was recorded approximately one
mile south of the project’s northern terminus. This site, a secondary deposition
of Godley’s burned trash from the 1950s, does not meet any of the criteria
necessary for inclusion in the NRHP and as such is not considered a historic
property.
The project historian examined historic-age resources built prior to 1959 within
2000 feet of the project’s proposed easement. Based upon the windshield
survey, project historians believe the proposed project has low potential for
adverse effects to historic properties under Section 106. Due to modern
intrusions, no historic rural landscapes are present. A full reconnaissance-level
survey of historic-age resources is not recommended at this time, barring
changes to the proposed alignment.
Based on the results of shovel testing, surface inspection, and the geomorphic
characteristics of the project landscape (typically ancient upland surfaces) as
well as results from the windshield survey of potential historic standing
structures, regulatory clearance for the project to proceed relative to Brazos
Electric Power Cooperative’s responsibilities under Section 106 of the NHPA is
recommended with no historic properties (structural or archeological) affected.
