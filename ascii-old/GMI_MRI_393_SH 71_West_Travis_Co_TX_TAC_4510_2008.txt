MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The project consists of an intensive survey of approximately 4.89 miles of proposed linear road
widening and a bridge replacement along SH 71 between Bee Cave and Austin, Travis County.
The scope of the proposed construction is described as widening the existing 4-lane undivided
rural highway to a 5-lane roadway that includes a center turn lane and 8-foot shoulders, and
replacement of the bridge at the Barton Creek crossing. The expansion of the roadway starts at
the intersection of SH 71 and Uplands Ridge Drive and ends at the intersection of SH 71 and
Silvermine Drive. The area of potential effect (APE) consists of the entire existing right-of-way,
measuring 150 feet wide, and impacts should not exceed 3 feet in depth except at the Barton
Creek bridge where impacts may go as deep as 15 feet. A series of late design revisions further
widened the initial plans in eight locations to include, at maximum, an additional 1.4 acres. The
total area surveyed is 90.31 acres.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this construction project area was to
determine the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate any identified
resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, as per
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as
a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Geo-Marine, Inc., archeologists initiated fieldwork on 5 June 2007 and concluded on 7 June 2007
(GMI project # 30011.10.01). In summary, a total of 36 judgmental shovel tests was excavated,
all revealing either disturbed context or the absence of cultural remains. In addition, a number of
areas were described as disturbed due to visual confirmation they no longer have any stratigraphic
integrity (e.g., exposed bedrock on the surface) and photodocumented only. There were no
cultural materials identified within the existing right-of-way, despite the fact eight sites
(41TV319, 41TV397, 41TV1023, 41TV1024, 41TV1027, 41TV1892, 41TV2123, and
41TV2124) were identified as potentially being within the APE. Therefore, it is recommended
that the proposed road improvements to SH 71 will have no adverse effect on historic properties
in or near the APE and construction may proceed. All notes, forms, and photographs obtained
during this project are on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory curation
repository, the University of Texas in Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report describes the results of an intensive cultural resources pedestrian survey conducted
along an approximately 4.89-mile stretch of SH 71 slated for widening from a 4-lane undivided
rural highway to a 5-lane roadway situated between the community of Bee Cave and the city of
Austin in Travis County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed widening includes a center turn lane
and 8-foot-wide shoulders, in addition to the replacement of the bridge at the Barton Creek
crossing. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), under subcontract with Turner Collie & Braden Inc.,
conducted the archeological survey of this new alignment in the Austin District of the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The archeological work was conducted from June 5â7,
2007, and undertaken in order to satisfy federal requirements governing cultural resources
treatment under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. Â§ 470 et seq.; P.L. 89â665; 80 Stat. 915] and the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 4321â4347; P.L. 91â190; 83 Stat. 852].
TxDOT, the ultimate client, created under enabling state legislation and thus a political entity of
the State of Texas, must comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the
Natural Resources Code of Texas]; therefore, the cultural resources investigation was carried out
under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4510.
The project area along SH 71 stretches southeastward from the intersection of Uplands Ridge
Drive and SH 71 and to the intersection of Silvermine Drive and SH 71. A recent series of
revisions, dated 7 August 2007 and obtained by GMI on 13 August 2007, has further widened the
proposed area of potential impact in eight separate locations totaling an additional 1.4 acres
maximum. No rights-of entry were initially required since there was no additional right-of-way
(ROW) needed, and the survey was conducted. A detailed review of the areas requiring
additional ROW based on the survey conducted, indicated that most of the areas were already
impacted or would reveal no new data on historic properties. The purpose of the cultural
resources investigations was to identify and inventory all cultural resources contained within the
proposed project area and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). GMI was
contracted to conduct an intensive pedestrian survey of 4.89 miles of pre-existing ROW with a
total width of 150 feet (ft) or 88.9 acres (ac). Impacts are not expected to exceed 3 ft in depth
except at the Barton Creek bridge where impacts may go as deep as 15 ft. Therefore, the total
Area of Potential Effect (APE) for this project is 4.89-miles long, minimally 150-ft to a

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area along SH 71âextending from the intersection of Uplands Ridge Drive at the
north end to the intersection of Silvermine Drive at the south endâis located west of the city of
Austin in Travis County, which is situated in Central Texas (see Figure 1). Travis County
includes portions of three physiographic regions: the Balcones Fault Zone, the Edwards Plateau,
and the Blackland Prairie. The project area occurs within the Balcones Fault Zone, which is
essentially a boundary or transition zone between the Edwards Plateau located to the north and
west and the Blackland Prairie located to the east and southeast. This chapter summarizes the
modern natural environmental conditions of the survey area, providing information on the
topography and hydrology, geology, soils, climate, and flora and fauna. The chapter concludes
with a discussion of the synthesized regional paleoenvironmental reconstruction as it is presently
understood, which ultimately serves as a backdrop for succeeding Chapter 3 that reviews the
cultural historic sequence of the region.

TOPOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
The Balcones Fault Zone is characterized by undulating and hilly topography that ranges from
about 213 to 335 meters (m; 700â1,100 ft) above mean sea level. The project area is drained by
numerous intermittently running streams (Williamson Creek and Short Spring Creek) with the
largest being Barton Creek, which drains into the Colorado River to the east-southeast of the
project area. The Colorado River eventually drains into the Gulf of Mexico, and as it passes
through Austin, the Colorado is referred to locally as either âTown Lakeâ or âLake Austin.â

GEOLOGY
Geologically, the project area is underlain by the Lower Cretaceous Fredericksburg Group,
undivided, which is composed of Edwards Limestone, Comanche Peak Limestone, Keys Valley
Larl, Cedar Park Limestone, Bee Cave Larl, and Walnut Formation, undivided. Edwards
Limestone, which contains limestone, dolomite, and chert, is massive to a thin-bedded, hard, and
brittle layer of bedrock. It can be found ranging from 18.3â106.7 m (60â350 ft) thick, forming
flat areas and plateaus bordered by scarps. This formation is of particular interest because chert
9

occurs in the Edwards Limestone in the form of either plates or nodules, which are bed
dependent. These locally available cherts were widely utilized by prehistoric indigenous
populations (Bureau of Economic Geology 1974).

SOILS
USDA (1974) has mapped seven soils within the project area: Brackett-Rock outcrop complex, 1
to 12 percent slopes; Brackett-Rock outcrop complex, 12 to 60 percent slopes; Mixed Alluvial
Land, 0 to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded; San Saba clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes; Purves silty
clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes; Tarrant soils, 5 to 18 percent slope; and Volente silty clay loam, 1 to 8
percent.

Brackett-Rock Outcrop Complex, 1 to 12 Percent Slopes
These soils occupy gently undulating to rolling topography, generally on benches 100 to 500 feet
wide that are separated by outcrops of the underlying limestone and marl. The slope is
predominantly 5 to 12 percent, but it ranges from 1 to 12 percent. These soils developed over
interbedded limestone and marl. Individual areas are more than 1,000 acres in size. The texture
of the surface layer is gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, loam, or clay loam (USDA 1974).
The A horizon is light brownish gray, brown, grayish brown, pale brown, or very pale brown.
Texture is clay loam, loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly loam. The B horizon is very pale
brown, pale brown, brown, pale yellow, light brownish gray, light yellowish brown, or grayish
brown. Texture is clay loam, loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly loam. The C horizon ranges
from interbedded weakly cemented limestone and marl to pink silt loam to a strongly weathered
white chalk of approximately silt loam texture (USDA 1974).
The potential of these soils to contain archeological materials is low because these soils are prone
to erosion and are generally thin. It is more likely historic materials will be associated with these
types of soils than prehistoric. Regardless, any cultural materials found in association with these
soils are likely to be surface finds and therefore lack context.

Brackett-Rock Outcrop Complex, 12 to 60 Percent Slopes
The Brackett-Rock outcrop complex is often found on steep locations along creeks and rivers.
Individual areas are long and narrow or irregular in shape and up to 1,000 acres in size. In most
areas, about 75 percent of the surface is covered by 2â4-inch limestone fragments. The slope
ranges from 15 to 30 percent. The composition of this mapping unit is variable, but it consists of
about 35 percent Brackett soils, 21 percent Rock outcrop, and 40 percent soils similar to the
Brackett soils (USDA 1974).
Brackett soils are on benches 15 to 50 feet wide that are separated by outcrops. The surface layer
is light brownish gray, gravelly clay loam or gravelly loam about 4 inches thick. About 60
percent of its surface is covered with coarse fragments. The next layer is pale brown clay loam
that extends to a depth of about 15 inches. The underlying material is interbedded limestone and
marl. The soils similar to the Brackett soils are less than 10 inches deep; they contain more than
10

35 percent limestone fragments or they rest directly on hard limestone. The percentage of Rock
outcrop and very shallow soils increases as the slope increases. Included in mapping were deeper
soils, such as those of the Volente, Lewisville, or Altoga series, in long, narrow valleys. These
included soils make up about 4 percent of the acreage (USDA 1974).
The potential of these soils to contain archeological materials is low because these soils are prone
to erosion and are generally thin. It is more likely historic materials will be associated with these
types of soils than prehistoric. Regardless, any cultural material found in association with these
types of soils is likely to be surface finds and therefore be without context or have even been
washed down from higher elevations.

Mixed Alluvial Land, 0 to 1 Percent Slopes, Frequently Flooded
Mixed Alluvial Land is a miscellaneous land type that occurs on the flood plains of creeks and
rivers. It consists of gravelly alluvium, beds of gravel, and exposed limestone beds and boulders
randomly interspersed with moderately deep to deep, calcareous alluvial materials. The flood
plains range from 150 to 325 feet in width and extend in a winding, irregular fashion for 25 to 50
miles. This long and narrow unit is nearly level overall, but areas at the outer limits of the flood
plains have slopes of up to 7 percent (USDA 1974).
The materials that make up this miscellaneous land type vary from place to place within any one
area and from one area to another. Most areas have three or four principal components,
depending on the width of the flood plain. All areas have a streambed of waterworn limestone
that is covered with patchy light gray silt loam alluvium 1 to 6 inches thick. Limestone boulders
occur on the streambed in most places. Areas of Mixed Alluvial Land also have a soil of dark
grayish brown, calcareous gravelly clay loam that rests abruptly on the limestone. This soil is
typically about 44 inches thick, but it ranges from 2 to 4 feet, and in some places has a 1â3-inch
overburden of yellowish brown sandy clay loam. The gravel content is about 30 to 50 percent by
volume (USDA 1974).
About half the areas have a layer of dark grayish brown, calcareous silty clay loam about 18
inches thick over a lighter colored substratum. This soil rests abruptly on limestone at a depth of
44 inches. Thickness of this soil ranges from about 16 to 48 inches. The surface layer ranges
from silty clay loam to sandy clay loam in texture, and from dark grayish brown to light
yellowish brown in color. The lower part of the substratum contains gravel (USDA 1974).
The archeological potential of these soils is dependent upon the duration or stability of the paleosurfaces within the individual deposits, which is a direct reflection of the localized paleoenvironment. The only area capable of producing a stable alluvial surface in this project area was
located near site 41TV397 close to Barton Creek, but was disturbed. Steep nearly shear creek
banks and rock outcrops, which would restrict floodwaters and increase the likelihood of the
continual disturbance of the alluvial deposits in this area, characterize the study area near Barton
Creek.

11

San Saba Clay, 1 to 2 Percent Slopes
San Saba clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes occupies smooth, single, and complex slopes on broad
uplands and in long, narrow valleys. Areas range from 10 to 40 acres in size. This soil has a
surface layer of very dark gray calcareous clay about 22 inches thick. The next layer is dark gray
clay about 16 inches thick. The underlying material is gray limestone. Included in mapping were
a few noncalcareous soils. A few others are slightly more than 40 inches thick over limestone.
Other included soils have a brownish color within 12 inches of the surface. Also included are
small areas that have 3 to 4 percent slopes (USDA 1974).
This soil type, located on the north side of SH 71 adjacent to but above Williamson Creek at
Silvermine Road, is a good environment for the preservation of both prehistoric and historic
cultural materials. The only drawback to this type of soil is its relation to water sources, which
may sometimes be upwards of several acres distant. Therefore, those cultural materials
associated with this type of soil and landforms are likely to be low density and represent
ephemeral use locations (USDA 1974). Shovel testing was utilized and current impacts in this
area verified the lack of cultural materials.
Purves Silty Clay, 1 to 5 Percent Slopes
Purves silty clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes occurs on irregularly shaped areas that range from 10 to 20
acres in size. Included within these mapped soils are up to 75 percent broken limestone
fragments on the surface and about 10 to 20 percent limestone fragments within the solum. These
soils are on small knolls where the weathered limestone has been exposed by plowing. In a few
soils, the surface layer is lighter colored than typical, and in others it is more than 20 inches thick.
A few areas that have up to 7 percent slopes are included (USDA 1974).
The Purves series consists of shallow, well-drained soils that developed in interbedded limestone
and marl. These soils occupy irregularly shaped areas on ridges and bench slopes. Slopes are
mostly complex. These soils developed under a cover of mid and tall grasses (USDA 1974).
These soils have the potential to contain both prehistoric and historic cultural materials due to
their location, such as Â¾ mi south of Barton Creek, and stability. The locations of the soil are
important because these soils are found on prominent settings on the landscape that were favored
by both prehistoric and historic peoples. Those materials associated with these settings will likely
be low density and potentially represent specific types of activities, but this is only possible if the
location has not been altered by the processes of erosion. Shovel testing in this area verified the
lack of cultural materials.
Tarrant Soils, 5 to 18 Percent Slopes
Tarrant soils and Urban land, 5 to 18 percent slopes, is an undifferentiated group occupying
ridges. It consists of about 70 percent Tarrant soils, about 25 percent Urban land, and about 5
percent other soils. Tarrant soils have a surface layer of grayish brown clay or clay loam, about 8
inches thick, that overlies limestone. Stones are on the surface and in the soil. The basic soil
characteristics are not appreciably reshaped in urbanization. In clearing brush, the upper few
inches of soil are moved about by bulldozers. Loose surface stones are generally hauled away.
Building sites are leveled as necessary for the type of construction, and frequently the mixture of
excavated soil and rock resulting from leveling is also hauled away (USDA 1974).
12

These soils, unfortunately, were observed to be more impacted than this general description
provides. The locations of these soils within this project area have largely been bulldozed and
graded. Then, these areas were covered with seed matting and subsequently experienced heavy
erosion. Therefore, the depths of the deposits are shallower in this project area than what would
be generally expected, which further reduces the likelihood of these areas containing cultural
materials.
Volente Silty Clay Loam, 1 to 8 Percent Slopes
The Volente series consists of deep, well-drained soils that developed in slope alluvium. These
soils occupy long and narrow valleys. Most valleys are 200 to 400 feet wide, but some are as
wide as 1,000 to 1,500 feet. Slopes are concave and predominantly 2 to 7 percent. Volente soils
developed under a cover of mid and tall grasses and a scattered overstory of trees (USDA 1974).
In a representative profile, the surface layer is dark grayish brown silty clay loam about 22 inches
thick over dark brown silty clay about 14 inches thick. The next layer is brown silty clay that
extends to a depth of about 46 inches. The underlying material, to a depth of 54 inches, is reddish
yellow clay loam. The soil is calcareous and moderately alkaline (USDA 1974).
In summary, â[v]olente complex, 1 to 8 percent slopes, is mainly found in long valleys, where it
occupies areas several hundred acres in size. Altoga and Lewisville soils make up about 20
percent of this complex. There are also small acreages of Frio, San Saba, Tarrant, Purves, and
Brackett soils, as well as Rock outcrop and Mixed alluvial land. The Lewisville, Altoga, and
Brackett soils are mostly on upper slopes, and the San Saba, Purves, and Tarrant soils and Rock
outcrop occur near drainageways. Frio soils and Mixed alluvial land are in the drainageways.
The complex also includes a varying number of other soilsâ (USDA 1974:60-62).
These soils, located adjacent to Barton Creek and the drainages and tributaries to Williamson
Creek, are developed from alluvial slope wash, and are likely to yield both prehistoric and
historic materials. The main issue with this soil is tied to European land use practices, which
could have caused severe erosion of these Volente soils if, for example, overgrazing were to
occur. Shovel testing where possible, were utilized, though impacts in these soils along the
corridor were extensive.

CLIMATE
The climate in Travis County is humid subtropical, with southerly prevailing winds. Hot
summers are followed by mild winters with cold periods of less than two days duration. These
winter drops in temperature follow cold fronts bringing strong northerly winds. Summer
temperatures range from a maximum monthly average of 101.4Â°F in August to a minimum
monthly average of 41.4Â°F in April. Moderate winter temperatures span a maximum monthly
average of 85.3Â°F in November to a minimum monthly average of 21.7Â°F in January (USDA
1974).
Precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year; over a 29-year period, Travis County
received an annual rainfall of 32.6 inches, with a monthly average of 2.7 inches. From April
through September, thundershowers bring large amounts of rain in short periods of time, whereas
winter precipitation takes the form of light rains. Occasionally, dissipating tropical storms cause
strong winds and heavy precipitation, but tornadoes and hailstorms are rare.

FLORA AND FAUNA
As indicated previously, the project area is situated in a transitional zone between two
physiographic regions. Therefore, the flora is a mixture of these two biotic provinces: the
Balconian (associated with the Edwards Plateau) and the Texan (associated with the Blackland
Prairie). Each is represented to varying degrees (Blair 1950).
The Balconian province is characterized by a scrub forest consisting mainly of Mexican cedar
(Juniperas mexicana), Texas oak (Quercus texana), and stunted live oak (Quercus virginiana)
that occurs in the more dissected areas corresponding to Tharpâs (1939) oak-cedar region.
Mesquite is found throughout the province. A mesic forest of large live oak (Quercus
virginiana), elm (Ulmus americana), hackberry (Celtic occidentalis), and pecan (Carya
illinoinensis) is associated with riparian environments (Blair 1950:113). The sandy soils of the
Texan province support oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack
oak (Quercus marilandica), and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Prior to the advent of historic
agriculture, the clay soils of this province supported tall-grass prairies (Blair 1950:100).
The project area, located at the northern end of the Balconian province, is in a faunal transition
zone characterized by an intermixture of vertebrate fauna from other biotic provinces:
Austroriparian, Chihuahuan, and Kansan (Blair 1950:113â115). The mammals are represented
by 57 species, none of which is restricted to the Balconian province. Major mammalian fauna
include the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (canis
latrans), fox (Vulpes velox), bobcat (Lynx rufus), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), fox squirrel
(Sciurus niger), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus
californicus), beaver (Castor canadensis), eastern woodrat (Neotoma floridana), badger (Taxidea
taxus), skunk (Mephitis mephitis), river otter (Lontra canadensis), and the extirpated pronghorn
(Antilocapra americana) and bison (Bison bison; Blair 1950:113â114; Schmidly 1983).
Important nonmammalian species consist of turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), bobwhite (Colinus
virginianus), box turtle (Terrapene ornata), snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), channel
catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and sunfish (Lepomis humilis) (Blair 1950:113â115; Schmidly
1983).

SYNTHESIS OF THE REGIONAL PALEOENVIRONMENTAL SEQUENCE
There are no detailed studies of the Quaternary geology for the present project area; however,
data from several local and regional studies are available and provide the general framework for
the paleoenvironmental sequence for the region. The majority of the regional studies have
occurred within the Colorado River valley (Baker and Penteado-Orellana 1977, 1978; Deussen
1924; Hill and Vaughan 1898; Looney and Baker 1977; Mandel 1980; Mathis 1944; Urbanec
1963; Sorenson et al. 1976; Weber 1968; and Weeks 1945). More recently, a series of studies has
focused on establishing a clear picture of the stratigraphic chronology of the region (Blum 1992;
Caran 1992; Fredrick 1987; Lohse and Caran 1995; Lundelius 1992; and Ricklis et al. 1991).
These studies in conjunction with additional independent research have contributed greatly to two
overarching yet competing interpretations of the regional sequence (Blum and Valastro 1994).
Rather than summarize an ongoing academic debate, this discussion summarizes the common
ground shared by these two regional syntheses and the interested reader is encouraged to refer to
these two sources as a starting point for further information.

The general depositional sequence in this region began after the maximum extent of the last ice
sheet at roughly 25,000 years before present (B.P.), which was long before the earliest
documentation of humans in the New World. The ice sheets were waning by 16,000 B.P., and the
climate in this region was considerably cooler (by 7.5Â°F) and more moist until roughly 11,500
B.P. (Graham 1987). This type of climate supported biotic zones containing spruce forests along
the margins of the ice sheets and, at a farther distance, varieties of pine, fir, and some deciduous
forests. The period is well noted because of the existence of âmegafauna,â which included
mastodon, mammoth, giant sloth, and Bison antiquus (Lundelius 1986). Deposits identified
through radiocarbon assays at the Avenue site in Austin are considered to be 15,000 years old
(Lundelius 1992) and have yielded the remains of such mammals, but no evidence of humans.
The succeeding period between 11,500 and 8,500 B.P. coincides with the earliest known evidence
of human occupation (Paleo-Indian) for the region and the extinction of the megafauna. The
climate is assumed to have been somewhat cooler and moister than it is presently with less
seasonal differentiation and is considered by some to have been the main catalyst for the
extinction of the megafauna (Lundelius 1986). However, there are others who subscribe to the
belief that early human hunters caused megafaunal extinction through over-predation (Martin
1984). The end of this period is marked by a general warming trend that fostered the intrusion of
the oak-savanna landscape that eventually transformed into scrub grasslands. Radiocarbon-dated
deposits from First Street Terrace at the Vera Daniels site near the confluence of Barton Creek
and the Colorado River contain cultural debris related to this time period (Caran 1992).
The next period of environmental change is reported to have occurred between 8,500 and 6,000
and involved the continuation of the warming and drying trend. Presumably, differentiation
between seasons became more exaggerated through the first half of this period and evidence
indicates the major river drainages became deeply incised, resulting in the formation of prominent
terraces. The deposits in the valleys begin to aggrade during the second half of this period as the
grasslands likely stabilized along with the climate, but trees probably persisted within the
Balcones Escarpment. It is generally assumed bison were scarce during the initial portion of the
period, but their populations increased as the grassland environments stabilized.

B.P.

The following period of environmental change was the interval between 6,000 and 4,500 B.C.,
marked by still further warmer and drier conditions. The period is identified as being the harshest
portion of the âaltithermalâ or great drought, but areas such as the Lubbock Lake site may have
experienced an amelioration of the drought conditions (Lintz 1995:13). It is also assumed the
major river systems became deeply incised again, because vegetation (and thus animal species as
well) was likely sparse. It is clear more research is needed to better understand this period.
The interval between 4,500 and 2,000 B.P. is unclear because of conflicting information being
interpreted in multiple ways (Gunn and Weir 1976). Generally, it is believed that the climate
became noticeably cooler and moister than the previous 1,500 years. Also evident from the
geomorphological studies of the area is that the major river valleys began filling with sediments
again as the amount of vegetation increased. Pollen and faunal remains indicate that the âmodern
biotic compositionâ was established during this time (Lintz 1995). Thus, it is generally accepted
that the oak-savannah vegetation expanded, and populations of such game animals as deer,
antelope, and bison increased from the prior very dry period.

15

The period between 2,000 and 500 B.P. remained essentially the same, with the exception of a
brief period of aridity between 1,000 â 500 B.P. that likely was associated with the massive
regional human population collapse. A shift observed in the faunal record on archeological sites
dating to this time indicates a modification from more moisture-favoring species, such as deer
and voles, to bison. Thus, this shift in faunal remains is potentially representative of a wholesale
environmental shift toward a drier period that expanded the grasslands. After this brief period,
the environment shifted back again to its present configuration. Likely, these shifts are within the
range of modern climatic variability but further research will be required to understand this
interval more fully.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

This chapter is subdivided into two sections: Previous Investigations and Regional Culture
History. The first section, Previous Investigations, emphasizes the research conducted within the
vicinity of the project area. The second section of this chapter, titled Regional Culture History,
provides a synthesized overview of the culture history of the area as generally accepted by the
professional archeological community.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the site files at the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, maintained by the Texas
Historical Commission, was conducted to examine the records for known cultural resources
within 1 kilometer (km) of the project area. Several surveys have been conducted near or
adjacent to the current project area and nearly all have recorded cultural resources. These major
surveys in the area included a West Travis County Pipeline survey conducted in 2005, a 1985
survey for the proposed Manorwood housing development, the 1999 Northern Hays and SW
Travis County Water Supply Line survey, and a survey of the CCNG Wastewater Interceptor
(Oksanen 2002). The only local survey to not identify cultural remains was a survey associated
with the search for unmarked graves along U.S. Highway 183 and SH 71 (Boyd 2003). Thirtytwo archeological sites occur within 1 km of the project area (Table 1). Eight of these sites could
potentially occur within the project area: 41TV319, 41TV397, 41TV1023, 41TV1024,
41TV1027, 41TV1892, 41TV2123, and 41TV2124.
Site 41TV319 was originally recorded in 1975 and revisited in 1979. It consisted of a small,
diffuse lithic scatter on a terrace overlooking the confluence of Barton and Little Barton creeks.
It was heavily impacted by a rodeo arena and no further work was recommended. Site 41TV397
consisted of several historic standing log structures on a terrace north of the confluence of Barton
and Little Barton creeks. The site was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places, but
whether it was accepted is unknown (Moore 1975). Site 41TV1023 was recorded in 1985 prior to
construction of a potential housing development that appears to never have been built. The site
was identified on a noticeable landform along the west of SH 71 about 1.25 miles from the
southern end of the project area and consisted of a large lithic scatter. Two Middle Archaic
projectile point bases were recovered as well as debitage representing all stages of reduction.
However, due to erosion, land clearing, lack of soil depth, and lack of archeological features, the

site was not recommended for further work. Site 41TV1024 was recorded during the same
project as 41TV1023. The site was recorded on a terrace below and to the north of 41TV1023
and consisted of a low density lithic scatter. Due to a lack of diagnostics and no soil depth, the
site was not recommended for further work. Site 41TV1027 was recorded in 1985 during the
same project that recorded sites 41TV1023 and 41TV1024. This site was found on the lower
benches of the south slope of Dittmar Hill. Artifacts collected included projectile points
indicative of Paleo-Indian, Early Archaic, and Late Archaic occupations as well as debitage
representing all stages of reduction. Some burned limestone was also observed scattered over the
area. Despite the materials observed and recovered, the site was not recommended for further
work due to the shallow soil depth and because the materials observed may have washed down
from higher up on Dittmar Hill and thus represented secondary deposits. Site 41TV1892 was
recorded in 1999 prior to construction of a water pipeline that has since been built. The site
consisted of an east-west, 1â2-course-high, dry-laid limestone wall above a small intermittent
drainage. It was recorded on the west side of SH 71. No other cultural materials associated with
the wall were observed, and thus no further work was recommended. Site 41TV2123 was
recorded in 2005 prior to a proposed pipeline, which may or may not have been constructed. The
site was recorded on a terrace above Burton Creek along the east side of SH 71 approximately
19

1.25 miles from the northern end of the current project area. It consisted of a low density lithic
scatter with historic bottles, barbeque pit, and septic tank. There were no recommendations for
additional work or eligibility made. Site 41TV2124 was recorded in 2005 during the same
project as 41TV2123. The site was reported as being located approximately one-quarter mile
from the northern end of the project area along the east side of the highway. It consisted of a
low-density lithic scatter, but no recommendations were made.
In addition to the archeological sites in the area, three cemeteries (Spillman, Dittmore-BellSprings-Bassford and North Bohls) are located within the 1-km radius of the project area. The
Spillman Cemetery is approximately 450 m northwest of the northern terminus of the project
area, and the Dittmore-Bell-Springs-Bassford Cemetery is approximately 650 m east of the ROW
in the southern part of the 1-km study area. Neither of these two cemeteries will be affected by
the road construction project. North Bohls Cemetery, however, is situated adjacent to the ROW
at the northern extent of the APE on the east side of SH 71. This cemetery was used during the
first half of the 1900s.

REGIONAL CULTURE HISTORY
The discussion of the regional culture history is separated into two sections: the Prehistoric Era
and the Historic/Contact Era. The prehistoric era presents an overview of the present
understanding of the lifeways and historical sequence of indigenous peoples within the region
prior to the arrivals of Europeans as based on archeological interpretations. The Historic/Contact
Era provides a generalized summary of the history of the region beginning with the arrival of
Europeans.

Prehistoric Chronological Framework
The history of archeology in Central Texas has been presented in some detail by Suhm (1960)
with more recent updates by Black (1989), McGraw and Hindes (1987) and Prewitt (1981, 1983).
Four major Native American cultural periods can be recognized in this area: Paleo-Indian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic/Contact, with several phases or complexes defined for the
prehistoric periods (Table 2). Brief descriptions of the cultural periods and their associated
phases or complexes are presented below. For more detail, the reader is directed to the abovementioned summaries, all of which include extensive bibliographies.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period is the earliest substantiated cultural period in Texas (see Table 1).
Cooler, wetter conditions were in place 12,000 years ago, and although a general drying trend
continued through Paleo-Indian times, climatic conditions were more stable than during the
subsequent Holocene. The period is often characterized as a culture of small but highly mobile
bands of foragers who were specialized hunters of Pleistocene megafauna. Most Paleo-Indian
sites are deeply buried and difficult to find, leaving the highly visible, often fortuitously
discovered, mammoth kill sites as the primary evidence of Paleo-Indian lifeways. Recent studies
address this bias, emphasizing the likelihood that large kills contributed little to overall food
requirements and that a primary reliance on other game animals and plant resources was likely

(Ferring 1989, 2001). Subsistence in this period certainly included large herbivores such as
mammoth, bison, and horse but was probably based more consistently on smaller animals such as
various species of turtle, land tortoise, alligator, mice, badger, and raccoon (Collins et al. 1989;
Story 1990) and presumably also included an array of plants (Collins 1998).
As across North America, the Paleo-Indian stage is the earliest substantiated cultural period in
Texas, and its defining trait is the fluted point tradition. Projectile points from this period were
made from high-quality toolstone and indicate high technical skill in flaking, exhibiting a
hallmark âflute,â which is a long, shallow flake scar extending from the base toward the tip of the
point, on one or both sides. In Central Texas, the Paleo-Indian stage falls into early and late
subperiods, which encompass three archeological complexes. The Early Paleo-Indian consists of
the Llano (ca. 10,000â9000 B.C.) and the Folsom (ca. 9000â8000 B.C.) complexes, which are
characterized by the fluted and lanceolate Clovis and Folsom projectile points, respectively. The
Late Paleo-Indian period (ca. 8000â6000 B.C.) is represented by the Plano complex (McGraw and
Hindes 1987:43).
The Llano complex is represented by the Clovis projectile point, the oldest point type found in
North America. Much research energy has been devoted to the makers of Clovis points, but the
material record of Llano peoples is largely limited to hunting activities associated with the
procurement of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna, such as mammoth. Animals were probably
trapped at water holes, in marshes, in broken terrain, or at slippery stream crossings where they
were successfully attacked, and no evidence of use of poison, pits, fire, or communal drives in the
procurement of mammoth has been identified. Clovis assemblages include the diagnostic chipped
stone fluted lanceolate Clovis point, along with engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone
bolas, and ochre (Collins 1995; Collins et al. 1992). Sites with Clovis components reported in
Central Texas include Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, Gault, Horn Shelter 2, Pavo Real,
and Crockett Gardens. Surface finds of distinctive Clovis points are reported from a number of
other localities (Meltzer and Bever 1995). The Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479), in Denton County,
21

contains an in situ Clovis camp with a variety of vertebrate remains and an abundance of lithic
debris (Ferring 1989). This site may potentially contain important subsistence data concerning the
exploitation of nonmegafaunal vertebrates by Clovis peoples.
By about 9000 B.C., the cool, wet climatic conditions of the Pleistocene had given way to
Holocene warming and drying. This change brought about the extinction of Pleistocene
megafauna, most notably the mammoth. Mammoth were replaced by a now-extinct form of bison
(i.e., Bison antiquus) as an important meat source for Paleo-Indian populations, a change
concurrent with the earliest record of the Folsom complex. Like the Llano complex, the bestknown remains from Folsom complex sites are the projectile points. The Folsom point is the
showpiece of one of the most technically refined lithic technologies in human history. Shorter
than Clovis points, âclassicâ Folsom points exhibit fine parallel flaking and large flutes that
extend across most of each face. Midland points, commonly believed to occur later in time, may
represent unfluted Folsom points, made to offset the production risks involved in fluting (Amick
1995). Folsom complex peoples hunted Bison antiquus by utilizing massive kills of bison herds
run into ravines. One such bison jump site is Bonfire Shelter, located in the Lower Pecos region.
Such sites are conspicuous, and thus much of what is know about Folsom subsistence and
technology comes from lithic artifacts found at these sites or nearby processing sites. Folsom tool
kits consisted of the fluted Folsom and the thin, unfluted (Midland) points, large thin bifaces, and
end scrapers that were more conducive to specialized hunting, particularly Bison antiquus
(Collins 1995:382).
By approximately 8000 B.C., the climate was trending toward more moderate conditions, and the
larger megafauna from the Early Paleo-Indian subperiod were no longer available. Most of the
associated faunal evidence dated to the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex reflects a human
subsistence pattern based on smaller animals and deer. Horn Shelter No. 2 (Forrester 1985)
located on the Brazos River in Bosque County, Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977) in Val
Verde County, and Wilson-Leonard (Collins 1998) in Williamson County have yielded
subsistence data indicating that a variety of vertebrate fauna was being consumed by the Late
Paleo-Indian peoples.
The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex is represented by a greater diversity of projectile points
(e.g., Plainview, Angostura, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina), which, although retaining a lanceolate
form, were unfluted. In contrast to evidence from the earlier subperiod, late subperiod points are
associated with modern bison (Bison bison) and often occur as surface finds throughout Central
Texas. The beginning of Prewittâs (1981) Early Archaic, or Circleville phase, is considered in
this report as the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex but has also been called the âPre-Archaicâ
(Sollberger and Hester 1972). The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex defies convenient labeling,
exhibiting a unique blend of lanceolate and stemmed points that appear to correspond with
lifeways reflecting Archaic subsistence alongside Paleo-Indian mobility. Again, little is known
about the complex in Central Texas, but toward the latter part of the Late Paleo-Indian period,
lanceolate points began to be replaced by stemmed points. Settlement-subsistence strategies
probably more closely approximated those of the Archaic than Early Paleo-Indian. More diverse
sites are associated with this period, including not only the mass bison kills, which by the Late
Paleo-Indian period consisted only of modern bison (Bison bison), but also campsites and
residences. The characteristics of the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Maryâs Hall
components are more Archaic-like in that burned rock features are found, although the features
are much smaller and contain less rock than the burned rock features in the subsequent Archaic.
At the Richard Beene site (41BX831) along the Medina River south of San Antonio (Thoms 1991),
22

several Late Paleo-Indian occupations (one of which appears to be in derived context) have been
identified between 8.5 and 10.5 m below ground surface. The assemblages from these components
appear to consist of Angostura points, Clear Fork gouges, drills, and gravers, and occur with burned
rock features.
Bison was the main source of meat for Late Paleo-Indian peoples; however, as previously
indicated, other species were probably also important. Horn Shelter No. 2 (Forrester 1985),
located on the Brazos River in Bosque County, and Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977), in Val
Verde County, both have yielded subsistence data indicating that a variety of vertebrate fauna
was being consumed by the Late Paleo-Indian peoples. In an examination of Paleo-Indian bison
procurement practices, it appears communal mass-killing of bisonâaccomplished by stampeding
a herd over a cliff or into a natural entrapment, such as a steep-sided ravine, where the bison were
then dispatchedâprobably did not develop until the Archaic period in Central Texas. Fire may
have been employed in the drives. As with earlier peoples, the meat diet of Late Paleo-Indian
populations was probably supplemented with wild plant foods such as nuts, berries, tubers, and
seeds.

Archaic Period
Toward the end of the Late Paleo-Indian period, a great variety of projectile point styles began to
appear. The subsequent Archaic period (ca. 6000 B.C.âA.D. 800) is broadly characterized by
stemmed and side-notched dart points and by the appearance of ground and pecked stone tools.
These technological changes reflect subsistence patterns, which demonstrate a greater
exploitation of local environments, with smaller game animals, fish, and wild plant foods
increasing in dietary importance. Although a more generalized lifestyle of hunting and gathering
developed, Archaic peoples, like their predecessors, apparently continued to follow a nomadic
way of life. Seasonal travel permitted a utilization of different food resources in various localities
(Weir 1976). McGraw and Hindes (1987:47) have noted that:
. . . in northern and central Bexar county, major [Archaic] occupation sites are situated on stream
terraces and are usually associated with one or a series of spatially proximate, often buried, burned
rock middens. An extensive distribution of chipped stone debitage and a variety of diagnostic
projectile points indicate recurring occupations that span several thousand years. Major Late
Prehistoric sites in contrast, are often physically discrete from these earlier sites.

The Archaic is generally divided into early, middle, and late subperiods (Black 1989; Collins
1995; Story 1985) based on diagnostic projectile point styles and associated radiocarbon assays
(Collins 1995). By the Middle Archaic in Central Texas, some regional distinctiveness is
apparent archeologically, as evidenced primarily by increased techno-stylistic diversity among
projectile point types. Interplay between influential factors of population increase and
environmental change toward greater aridity and climatic variability probably drove adaptive
change throughout the Archaic. The following discussion follows Storyâs (1985) broader
subdivisions of the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic, although Prewittâs (1981) discussion of
various phases within these periods provides much of the information discussed.
The most archeologically obvious changes from the Paleo-Indian to the Early Archaic (6000â
3000 B.C.) are the shift from the lanceolate points in the Paleo-Indian tradition to the stemmed
and side-notched dart points emblematic of the Archaic and the appearance of ground stone
23

implements. Three recognized point styles (Angostura, Early Split Stem [Gower and Jetta], and
Martindale-Uvalde) indicate that the makers tended to occupy the better-watered eastern part of
the Edwards Plateau (Collins 1998:65). Assemblages also include Clear Fork and Guadalupe
bifaces, other bifaces, manos, metates, hammerstones, burins, and circular scrapers. Few burials
have been assigned to this period (Prewitt 1981:77â79; Story 1985:34â35), and
settlement/subsistence systems are âhypothesized to have been diffuse, utilizing a variety of
resources and frequently shifting the loci of subsistence activities rather than intensifying the use
of any specified resourceâ (Story 1985:39).
Projectile point types constitute the primary source of information about the Early Archaic, but
Prewitt (1981, 1983) uses point types to define four phases: the Circleville, San Geronimo,
Jarrell, and Oakalla, respectively. This refinement is assessed by some as unsubstantiated since
few intact sites are known (Black 1989:26; Black and McGraw 1985), but the tendency for many
Early Archaic sites to occur around the Balcones Escarpment leads several researchers to infer
that this area was a refuge from drier conditions in Central Texas and on the coastal plains
(McKinney 1981; Story 1985). Concentrations of Early Archaic sites along the southern and
eastern margins of the Edwards Plateau may be indicative of climatic conditions at the time, as
these environments had more reliable water sources and a diverse subsistence base. The margins
of the Edwards Plateau are ecotonal in character and may have provided reliable resources during
times of environmental stress (Story 1985:31, 34). Convincing paleoenvironmental data on the
climatic conditions of this period are nonetheless still lacking.
Early Archaic sites are small (Weir 1976:115â122), suggesting that populations were highly
mobile and densities were low (Prewitt 1983:217). Early Archaic sites are usually described as
open campsites (such as Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Jetta Court,
Youngsport, Camp Pearl Wheat, and Landslide) or lithic procurement stations. Only a few
campsites located in rockshelters (e.g., Kincaid Rockshelter) occur on the Edwards Plateau during
this period. The location of lithic procurement sites is determined by the natural distribution of
cherts. Large and varied burned-rock features (e.g., at Sleeper, Camp Pearl Wheat, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene) become common in the latter part of the Early Archaic, and domestic
structures (e.g., at Turkey Bend Ranch) and caches (e.g., Linder) are also known in the Early
Archaic (Collins 1998:64). Fresh-water mussel, deer, and small game appear to have been
important food resources. Hearths are occasionally found at Early Archaic sites and can be stonelined, basin-shaped, or flat. The appearance of ground stone signifies a shift to plant resources,
and the diversification of lithic technology appears to reflect an increased reliance on gathering.
The Middle Archaic (3000â1000 B.C.) marks the first period of Central Texas distinctiveness as
an archeological region. The subperiod exhibits more numerous and more varied sites than the
preceding Early Archaic. This cultural manifestation is characterized by a population increase;
the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns; and changes in settlement patterns,
economic and social systems, and technology (Prewitt 1983). In addition, territorial boundaries
may have begun to emerge (Story 1985:39).
Burned-rock middens, often consisting of massive amounts of fire-cracked limestone, are,
however, the preeminent archeological features of the Middle Archaic. Many of these middens
may represent earthen ovens used to process live oak acorns (Creel 1986; Weir 1976), as well as
roasting succulents or other plants and animals. Many Central Texas trees disappeared from the
paleoenvironmental record at this time, leaving live oak forests to dominate the landscape. A
renewed focus on deer, which themselves were well suited for the oak-savanna environment, is
24

likely. Weir (1976:124â130) suggests that an expansion of oak forests influenced the
development of an economic system that focused on the exploitation of deer, acorns, and other
hardwood nuts. Prewitt (1983:222â226) notes that the abundance of rock middens indicates a
greater reliance on plant foods, although tool kits still infer a strong reliance on hunting.
Middle Archaic sites in Central Texas are represented by rockshelters, campsites, lithic quarries,
and kill sites (Weir 1976), as well as the burned rock middens that first appeared toward the end
of the Early Archaic. Other features include basin hearths and large flat hearths. Data concerning
mortuary practices are not available except for the end of the Middle Archaic, during which
cremations have been reported (Prewitt 1981:81). Three point styles comprise this subperiod:
Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis. Bifaces, a variety of scrapers, unifaces, and
grinding stones are also present. Prewitt (1981:73) suggests that, compared to total number of
tools, the proportion of projectile points (50 percent) is indicative of a balance between the
exploitation of plant and animal resources.
Late Archaic (1000 B.C.âA.D. 800) lifeways began similarly to those of the Middle Archaic, but
notable changes characterized by the emergence of new cultural patterns as well as the
intensification of preexisting ones occurred (Story 1985:45). Coastal marine shells, either used as
ornaments or as raw materials for ornaments, were exchanged with inland groups, at least on a
limited basis, in return for finished lithic tools and/or siliceous raw material (Story 1985:48). The
use of burned rock middens throughout the Late Archaic appears to have been a major part of the
subsistence strategy as a decrease in the importance of hunting, inferred by the low ratio of
projectile points in relation to other tools in site assemblages, may have occurred (Prewitt
1981:74). Bison, which had been absent from the area for most of the Archaic, were once again
available in the region (Dillehay 1974).
Late Archaic sites include rockshelters, campsites, and large cemeteries. The establishment of
these large cemeteries along drainages suggests strong territorial ties by certain groups (Story
1985:40). In addition to cemeteries (e.g., Orchard [41BX1]; Story 1985:49), isolated flexed
burials have been recorded for this period (Prewitt 1981:81â82). Features include basin hearths,
arcuate hearths, and mussel shell caches. The lithic assemblages contain a variety of dart point
styles (e.g., Bulverde, Pedernales-Kinney, Lange-Williams-Marshall, Marcos-MontellCastroville, Ensor-Frio-Fairland, and Darl); Erath, San Gabriel, and Hare bifaces; gravers;
scrapers; a variety of unifaces and bifaces; grinding stones; and boatstones. Except for Montell
and Fairland, the point styles for the Late Archaic are among the most widely distributed dart
points (Prewitt 1983). Other artifacts include ulna flakers, bone beads and awls, stone and marine
shell gorgets, and fresh-water mussel shell pendants (Prewitt 1981:81â82).

Late Prehistoric Period
Following the Archaic, the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 800â1700) is characterized by the
replacement of the atlatl-and-dart with bow-and-arrow technology. Later during this Late
Prehistoric period, at roughly A.D. 1200, ceramics or pottery making was adopted. Basin-shaped
and flat hearths and burned clay/charcoal lenses and pits are the predominant archeological
features, and rockshelter occupations were common. Flexed and semiflexed burials occur near
habitation sites, usually in cemeteries, such as Loeve-Fox (Prewitt 1983), but also as isolated
occurrences, a continuation of Late Archaic burial practices (Prewitt 1981:83). Some burials were
cremations, carried away from cemeteries and placed in shallow pits. The Late Prehistoric period
25

is composed of the Austin and Toyah phases, which are well established. It is not known how
these phases are related to previous groups, but Prewitt (1983:225â228) has suggested that they
might represent influences from the north. Presently, the social forces that brought these
influences into the region are unknown.
The Austin phase (ca. A.D. 800â1300) is distinguished by the first appearance of the expanding
stem arrow point. The diagnostic projectile points of the Austin phase are the Scallorn and
Granbury. Among the wide variety of tools are Friday bifaces and unifaces, other bifaces,
scrapers, ground stone, ulna flakers, and bone awls. Other artifacts include painted stones, bone
beads, and marine shell beads and pendants. Projectile points are proportionately more common
during the Austin phase, as hunting appears to have become increasingly important. The
widespread occurrence of Scallorn points outside of Central Texas and the frequency of marine
shell indicate a broad cultural entity and/or the expansion of extensive trade networks during the
Late Prehistoric.
Despite the continuity of an âoverall subsistence pattern of a mobile, broad-based huntinggathering traditionâ (McGraw and Hindes 1987:48), other changes also are apparent. Austin
phase sites occur on terraces and in rockshelters. Prewitt (1981) suggests a population decline
during this phase, and a concurrent shift in settlement pattern from open habitation sites to
rockshelters may be discerned. In addition, true cemeteries appear to be widespread. Although
the subsistence economy was still heavily dependent on gathering a variety of plant foods, an
emphasis on hunting seems to have taken place as indicated by an increased ratio of projectile
points to other tools and by an increased frequency of deer bones in midden deposits (Prewitt
1981:74, 83). In addition to Scallorn points, the artifact assemblage includes Friday bifaces,
scrapers, unifaces, grinding stones, painted stones, ulna flakers, bone awls and beads, and marine
shell beads and pendants. Basin-shaped hearths are present.
The subsequent Toyah phase (ca. A.D. 1300â1700) is characterized by contracting stem arrow
points (i.e., Perdiz), bone-tempered ceramics, small end scrapers, and diamond-shaped, beveled
knives (Prewitt 1981:74, 83). Because bison were once again available in Central Texas
(Dillehay 1974), there was probably a dramatic shift in the subsistence economy. Hunting,
especially of bison, may have attained equal or greater importance than gathering. This is
reflected by the lithic tool assemblage that seems to have been oriented toward bison procurement
and processing characteristic of Toyah sites (Prewitt 1981:74, 84). However, faunal data from
sites such as Panther Springs Creek (41BX228; Black and McGraw 1985) indicate that deer
continued to be the most important meat resource in some locations. Cultigens are occasionally
recovered from Toyah phase sites and âthe occasional presence of corn cobs suggest that either
Toyah phase peoples actively traded with agricultural peoples; or they practiced a mixed hunting,
gathering, and nomadic horticultural subsistence patternâ (Prewitt 1981:74).
Sites from the Toyah phase are characterized by Perdiz and Cliffton points and the presence of
ceramics. Subsistence strategies shifted even further toward hunting in response to the
reoccupation of Central Texas by bison (Dillehay 1974). The importance of bison to the Toyah
economy is readily deduced from the makeup of artifact assemblages represented at a number of
archeological sites. The Buckhollow site (41KM16) produced an abundance of Perdiz arrow
points (Johnson 1994). Also found were Harahey knives, most of them exhibiting four beveled
edges. The use wear is representative of cutting bison hides and fleshâa hypothesis supported
by the recovery of large numbers of bison bones. Also indicative of the importance of bison is
the recovery of large end scrapers from the site. The presence of edge rounding and polish on bit
ends indicates use on fresh hides, most of which were probably bison (Johnson 1994).
26

The Hinojosa site (41JW8), located in Jim Wells County in southern Texas, represents a Late
Prehistoric Toyah base camp dating from A.D. 1300 to 1500 (Black 1986). Specialized hunting
adaptations are evident from the archeological materials, though a broad subsistence base of fish,
softshell turtle, aquatic birds, and mussel shell was also exploited. Deer figured prominently in
the overall assemblage, with bison and pronghorn antelope also contributing a significant portion
to overall subsistence (Black 1986). Artifacts reflecting the Toyah phase include scrapers,
beveled knives, and mussel shell pendants, as well as bison bone tools, beads, and awls.
Perishable artifacts such as cordage and basketry are found at some sites. Corncobs have also
been recovered, indicating either trade relations with agricultural peoples or some degree of
horticulture (Prewitt 1981:74). Extensive trade relations are also indicated by the presence of
Caddo ceramics, such as Leon Plain and Doss Redware among other imported types. Toyah
phase burials sometimes contain artifacts, but it is not established that these are grave goods.
Perdiz and Cliffton points found in burials may be from fatal wounds and indicative of increased
conflict (Prewitt 1981:83â84).
Historic Period
Native American
The most radical cultural changes in Central Texas occurred during the Historic/Contact period,
which is characterized by the invasions of nonlocal Indian groups, such as the Apache and the
Comanche and by the appearance of and domination by Europeans. Although possible initial
contact with Spaniards was made in the early 1500s, the local Indian population in Central Texas
probably did not change culturally until the later 1600s when, under pressure from horse nomads,
local groups began to seek the protection of Spanish missions. Prior to this time, the changes that
occurred were probably adaptations of elements of European material culture by local groups
rather than a destruction or abandonment of their own cultures. After 1700, many traditional
stone, bone, and wooden items were replaced by European metal, glass, cloth articles, and guns.
Eventually, the traditional cultures of the local populations collapsed. European-introduced
diseases had a devastating effect on local groups. After the reintroduction of the horse onto the
plains, the nomadic raiding groups (i.e., first the Apache, then the Comanche) from the north and
west finally forced most local groups to abandon much of the area. Nevertheless, it is clear from
excavations of historic sites in San Antonio that the process of integrating Indians into European
society was accompanied by a great deal of cultural survival, and even European borrowing of
Indian material culture. Today, the only Native American group who has claimed Central Texas
ancestry are the Tonkawa (Black 1989:33).
Anglo-American
Texas in general has had a rich and complex history that stretches back almost as far as the initial
presence of Europeans in North America. Austin, in present-day Travis County, was not settled
by European-Americans, however, until the early 1800s. A brief summary of the surrounding
regionâs early history is presented here as a context for the settlement of Austin. The following
discussion is intended to be only a general overview of this history, and for more detail, the
reader is referred to the sources listed in the references. For the sake of convenience, this section
has been divided into several subsections covering various time periods, spanning Spanish
exploration and early missionizing efforts, permanent Spanish colonial settlement, Mexican
statehood, the Texas Republic, American statehood, post-Civil War, and the twentieth century.
27

Early Spanish Exploration and Missionization: 1519â1718
The initial Spanish presence in Texas began with the arrival of Alonso Alvarez de PiÃ±eda on the
Texas coast in 1519 to explore the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Webb 1952a:380). Attempts to
explore and colonize continued, and in 1528, Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca landed accidentally
on an island known to the Spanish as Malhado, possibly Galveston Island (Webb 1952b:261â
262), when a boat in which he was marooned was driven ashore. Several scholars have suggested
that Cabeza de Vaca and his companions eventually traveled up the Guadalupe or San Antonio
River valley after leaving the coast and thus passed close to the San Antonio area. Although their
exact route is still in dispute, it is known that his small group managed to cross the continental
divide and in 1536 was met by Spanish slave catchers in Sonora or Sinaloa, Mexico, and
subsequently taken to Culiacan (Webb 1952b:262â263). Although exploration of the region
continued apace, it was clear by 1550 that there were no golden cities or wealthy countries to
conquer north of Mexico. Consequently, Spanish expansion into the American southwest and
Texas slowed, leaving eastern Texas largely unexplored.
During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in southern Texas, tension between
Coahuiltecan groups and the Spanish, and Coahuiltecan groups and the Apache, escalated. This
ultimately led to the Spanish protection of the Coahuiltecan groups against the Apache, and the
establishment of the first Spanish missions in 1670. Eventually, four missions were established
on the Coahuila frontier, each of which was to service the groups in an area running north-south
across the Rio Grande (John 1975:172â174). Subsequently, Spanish fear of an increased French
presence in Texas led to the decision to establish missions and presidios in East Texas as a buffer
against further French encroachment into the region (Webb 1952b:483â484), after the French, led
by RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, began intruding into eastern Texas and established
Fort Saint Louis in 1685 (John 1975:182).
Missionization in Texas reached its culmination in May 1718 when the locations for a new mission
on the western bank of the San Antonio River and a town three-fourths of a league away near San
Pedro Springs were designated. The former was to be called Mission San Antonio de Valero and
the latter Villa de BÃ©xar. Although actual construction of the town and mission did not occur
until 1719 due to a lack of men and material, this marked the beginning of permanent Spanish
settlement in Texas.

Spanish Colonial Settlement: 1718â1821
The three-pronged approach that the Spanish used for settlement included presidio, mission, and
civilian settlements, which proved to be more successful that the establishment of mission and
presidio, or presidio alone. Population growth during the mid-1700s was slow, and most
inhabitants were members of military households. The San Antonio missions (San JosÃ© y San
Miguel de Aguayo founded 1720 on the banks of the San Antonio River several miles to the south
of San Antonio de Valero [the Alamo], and three East Texas missions relocated to San Antonio in
1731âNuestra SeÃ±ora de la ConcepciÃ³n de AcuÃ±a, San Juan Capistrano, and San Francisco de
la Espada) attracted a variety of Indian groups, primarily hunter-gatherers who were chiefly
Coahuiltecan and Karankawan. The missions also attracted Indians of other origins, some of whom
were fleeing Spanish disruptions in Nuevo Leon and other regions of northern Mexico. Mission
settlements were disrupted frequently from 1721 to 1749 by raiding Apache. Even after a formal
truce had been signed in 1749, thievery and limited hostilities took place throughout the rest of the
28

century (de la Teja 1988:61). Hostilities also occurred with various Comanche bands, who
disapproved of the tentative link between the Spanish and the Apache during the last half of the
1700s.
Outside political factors during the latter half of the eighteenth century had a great impact on the
region. The secularization of the missions by 1793 was a result of their decline in status as a
response to the removal of the French threat. By 1810, Spanish rule had been rapidly
deteriorating. Filibusters, encouraged by the claim that Texas was actually part of American
Territory, made forays into the province. In addition, battles were waged between Spanish
loyalists and revolutionaries, resulting in the frequent changing of the governing body. In a
particularly bloody incident, 1,000 persons in the province who were, or were accused of, being
revolutionaries were rounded up and executed or exiled. Large areas of improved farmland
became fallow, and food was scarce (Fehrenbach 1968:130). Growing discontent in the
provinces resulted in 10 years of bitter strife, culminating in Mexican independence from Spain in
1821.

Mexican Statehood: 1821â1836
Following Mexican independence, conditions in Texas slowly improved. Beginning in 1823,
immigration laws were changed to allow empresarios to offer lands to heads of families willing
to settle in Texas. The policy had been initially investigated by the Spanish as a means of
securing the territory and providing a buffer zone against Indian attack. In fact, Moses Austin
had applied for and received permission to bring American colonists to Texas in 1821, prior to
Mexican independence (Fehrenbach 1968:135). Austin, granted the right to settle 300 families in
Texas, never saw his grant. By the time he returned to his home in Missouri, his health had
broken; but before his death, he convinced his son, Stephen, to carry out his plans (Fehrenbach
1968:136).
Stephen F. Austin willingly followed in his fatherâs footsteps. Because of the liberal land policies
of first Spain and then later Mexico, he had many eager volunteers ready to accompany him.
Colonists had to be of good moral character and were required to become Spanish (then Mexican)
citizens. They were also required to convert to Catholicism, although this requirement was not
rigorously enforced. Under Spanish/Mexican law, land was distributed as follows: one labor (177
acres) to each family engaged in farming, one league (4,428 acres) to each family engaged in
ranching, and one-third league (1,476 acres) to each single rancher (Fehrenbach 1968:140). The
government charged a flat title fee, and Austin received a fee. The law required the land to be
developed within two years or forfeited. In all, 297 titles were issued with only seven being
forfeited. Most of the settlers claimed to be ranchers for obvious reasons.
Former Spanish provinces were turned into sovereign states. Texas and Coahuila were combined
into one state and Saltillo was designated the capital. The legislature of Coahuila passed its own
colonization laws in 1825, which continued to open the area to Euro-American settlement. Some
26 empresarios were in colonial Texas. After a decade of empresarios, there were over 20,000
Euro-Americans along with their slaves in Texas. The impact of this presence can be understood
when one realizes that the empresarios managed to accomplish more in a decade than the
government of Spain had in three centuries.

29

One of the effects of increased immigration was the opening and improvement of roadways,
many of which followed the Spanish caminos. The influx of settlers into the region brought
changes in local politics as well, with Anglo-American immigrants gaining more power. In many
areas of Texas, Mexicans were becoming politically overshadowed by the new immigrants. The
Mexican government, alarmed by this situation, passed the Decree of April 6, 1830, which
prohibited the further âcolonization of Mexican territory by citizens of adjacent countriesâ
meaning the United Statesâ (Fehrenbach 1968:165), and the importation of slaves. This decree
further alienated the Anglo-American settlers.
From 1832 to 1835, a series of conflicts and temporary solutions continued to drive a wedge
between Colonial Texas and Mexico. When meetings were held in San Felipe, the AngloAmerican immigrants adopted resolutions and framed a state convention resulting in the
formation of a state separate from Coahuila. In 1835, it became known that a Mexican army had
crossed the Rio Grande bound for San Antonio to squelch the rebellious Texans. A call to arms
was issued, and hostilities were begun in earnest (Fehrenbach 1968:193).
Many of these conflicts, later known as the Texas Revolution, were fought in and around the city
of San Antonio. These engagements culminated in the battle at the Alamo (formerly Mission San
Antonio de Valero) in the spring of 1836. During the siege of the Alamo, elected representatives
from the colonies were meeting at Washington-on-the-Brazos, where on March 2, 1836, the
Texas Declaration of Independence was signed. After his victory at the Alamo, Santa Annaâs
forces were defeated by the Texans at the Battle of San Jacinto. The Republic of Texas was born.

The Republic of Texas: 1836â1846
In 1836, the Republic of Texas was a âbackwater.â The government of the new republic was
loosely organized, there were no schools (Fehrenbach 1968:247), and most of the 40,000
residents were subsistence farmers. When the first elections were held, an overwhelming
majority voted to approve a union with the United States. The issue of slavery, however, stood in
the way of this annexation for 10 years. The old Spanish/Mexican conventions, though, were
quickly replaced with the more familiar American customs.
Texas was eager to encourage immigration and it did so by offering land, its most abundant
commodity. Travelers across the region wrote enthusiastic letters back home:
Texas is certainly one of the finest countries in the world, the salubrity of her climate and the
luxuriance of her soil is beyond doubt unparalleled in the known world, here it seems to be one
perpetual spring [Hale 1836].

The policy of disbursing land during the years of the Republic of Texas was governed by the
Constitution. There were three classes of settlers:
First Classâarrived before March 2, 1836
Heads of Householdâone league (4,428 acres) and one labor (177 acres)
Single Manâone-third league
Second Classâarrived between March 2, 1836, and October 1, 1837
Heads of Householdâ1,280 acres
Single Manâ640 acres
30

Third Classâarrived between October 1, 1837, and January 1, 1840
Heads of Householdâ640 acres
Single Manâ320 acres
Each settler was responsible for locating the land, often unavailable in the county of current
residence; providing witnesses who would attest to his (or her) arrival date; and paying for the
survey and the filing fees. In most counties, the Board of Land Commissioners worked without
delay because of the extreme importance of land to the citizens. Land was also distributed in
differing amounts for military service. âThus, it was virtually impossible, theoretically, for a
Texas family to be landlessâ (Fehrenbach 1968:283). Later, the land laws of the State of Texas
were set up in much the same way, with land also being granted preemptively, through
âsquattersâ rights.â
In 1839, the city of Austin, named in honor of Stephen F. Austin, was established to serve as the
republicâs permanent capital. The Texas Congress established a site selection committee in
January 1839. As per the instruction of President Mirabeau Lamar, the selection committee
visited a site on the western frontier, along the Colorado River. Immediately, impressed by its
beauty, abundant natural resources, and central location in Texas territory, the commission
purchased 7,735 acres of land along the Colorado River. Under the direction of Edwin Waller,
surveyors L. J. Pilie and Charles Schoolfield laid out the town of Austin on a 640-acre site
situated between Waller Creek on the east and Shoal Creek on the west (Humphrey 1985).
The first sale of lots in the newly laid-out capital city of Austin was held August 1, 1839, under
an oak tree in what is now known as Republic Square. Advertisements had been placed in
newspapers throughout Texas and in New Orleans. The sheriff auctioned 291 lots for a total of
$182,585 revenue produced for the Republic of Texas. The highest price paid was $2,800 for the
lot at the northeast corner of Congress and Cedar (4th Street) and the lowest price paid was $120
for a lot in the 700 block of West Walnut (14th Street) [Austin City Connection 2002].
In an attempt to have Austin ready for the Texas Congress to convene, temporary government
buildings were erected, including a one-story capitol building. Austin was officially incorporated
on December 27, 1839. Just prior to incorporation, Austin received the cityâs first newspaper, the
City Gazette, and the Presbyterians organized the first church. By 1840, the 856 inhabitants of
Austin had elected Edwin Waller to serve as the cityâs first mayor (Humphrey 1985). Travis
County was created in 1840 and named for William Barret Travis, a hero in the Texas war for
independence.
With the question of Texas annexation to the United States still unanswered, Mexico again tried
to reclaim Texas as a territory in 1837. In 1842, the early growth Austin had experienced came to
a halt when Sam Houston succeeded Mirabeau B. Lamar as president of the republic. President
Houston ordered the national archives, housed in Austin, to be transferred to Houston for
safekeeping after Mexican troops attempted to recapture San Antonio. The citizens of Austin
believed that the move to transfer the archives was a move to select a new capital. Even though
Houston was able to move the government from Austin, he was never able to move the archives.
When Houstonâs men were sent to seize the records, they were met by the citizens of Austin and
Travis County in an incident known as the Archive War. Even though Austin was able to
maintain custody of the archives, the city suffered without its political function. The population
dropped below 200, and many of the buildings fell into a state of disarray (Work Projects
Administration 1940). Finally, after a truce between Mexican and Texan forces had been
31

declared in 1843, the annexation of Texas was once again raised in the American Congress. By
this time, sentiment had shifted in the United States, and on December 29, 1845, Texas was
officially annexed and Austin was once again named the capital.

Early U.S. Statehood: 1846â1865
The annexation of Texas by the United States brought about many changes in the region. The
period generally is known as one of development and industrialization (Fox 1989:89).
Commerce, which had faltered in the Texas Republic period during hostilities with Mexico,
improved. Immigration from the United States increased rapidly, as did the arrival of refugees
from abroad. In 1840, Austin had about 856 inhabitants, but by 1860, a diversified population of
3,546 lived there.
The Civil War dominated life in Austin from 1861 to 1865. Residents of Travis County voted
against the secession ordinance, but Unionist sentiment waned once the war began. The Tom
Green Rifles, based in Austin, served with Hoodâs Texas Brigade in Virginia. Although the city
was never directly threatened during the war, Austin experienced shortages of goods, price
inflation, and the loss of men similar to other Texas cities.

Post-Civil War Period: 1865â1900
The years immediately following the Civil War were ones of economic setbacks and adjustments
for all of Texas. The end of the war found the state economically devastated. During the period
of âReconstruction,â Union soldiers occupied the state and radical Republicans ran the
government. Despite these setbacks, Texas in general began the slow return to economic
stability. The newly emancipated African-Americans of Austin developed the communities of
Masontown, Wheatville, Pleasant Hill, and Clarksville.
The seeds for Austinâs recovery lay in the arrival of the railroad. The Houston and Texas Central
(H&TC) arrived in Austin in 1871, linking the city with other cities in Texas. As a result, Austin
experienced a period of population growth in the late 1800s as it was transformed into a major
trading center. The new immigrants created a culturally diverse city of Hispanics, Southern
Anglos, Irish, Swedes, and Germans. The economic boom caused by the railroads brought many
changes to Austin. A number of civic improvements such as gas street lamps, the first streetcar
line, and an elevated bridge across the Colorado River were undertaken. However, the cityâs
dream of becoming a major trading center was short-lived. By 1875, new railroads passed by
Austin, diverting much of their trade to other towns (Humphrey 1985).
As Austinâs economic leadership dreams faded, its position as a political center solidified. In
1872, Austin was chosen as the permanent location of the state capital and a new capitol was
dedicated. Austin also became a major center for education. When Edwin Waller planned the
city of Austin in 1839, he set aside 40 acres of land thought to be considered most appropriate for
a university. A bill was finally passed by state legislators on March 30, 1881, 42 years later,
establishing the University of Texas. After a heated statewide election, Austin was chosen as the
site for the newly created University of Texas (The Handbook of Texas Online 2002).

32

Twentieth Century: Post-1900
By the turn of the century, Austinâs population began to grow substantially, and by 1920, Austin
had 34,876 inhabitants. However, Austin continued to struggle as economic ideas faltered and
city services deteriorated. Soon Austin found itself falling behind other major Texas cities. In
1905, there was only one paved street in the city and virtually no public parks or sanitary sewers.
In 1924, the residents of Austin voted to adopt a council-manager form of city government in the
hopes that city planning and beautification would become city policy. Shortly afterwards, the
first city plan subsequent to the original establishment of Austin was proposed. The goal of the
plan was to develop Austin into a leading residential, cultural, and educational center. In 1928, a
$4,250,000 bond issue provided the necessary funds for street, sewer, and park improvements. In
addition, a city hospital, the first permanent public library, and municipal airport were also
established (The Handbook of Texas Online 2002).
During the early and mid-1930s, Austin, like much of the country, experienced the harsh effects
of the Great Depression. The town fared comparatively well, however, due to its foundations of
government and education. As Austin struggled through the Great Depression, its population
soared 66 percent from 53,120 to 87,930. By 1936, the Public Works Administration (PWA)
provided Austin additional funding for municipal construction projects (The Handbook of Texas
Online 2002. One of the more notable projects completed in Austin at that time was the U.S.
Courthouse, located on West Eighth Street. For more than 29 years, Lyndon B. Johnson, former
president of the United States, maintained an office in the building, first as U.S. Senator and later
as Vice-President of the United Sates.
In the 1940s, construction was completed on the Tom Miller and Mansfield dams. These two
dams, in conjunction with a network of additional dams in the Lower Colorado River Authority
system, provided a source of hydroelectric power to the surrounding communities. In addition,
the dams created the Highland Lakes, which enhanced the appeal of Austin and added economic
benefits of tourism and recreation on the lakes. Austinâs population continues to grow at the
average rate of 40 percent per decade, continuing to reflect the rapid expansions of education and
government (The Handbook of Texas Online 2002).

RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

INTRODUCTION
The cultural resources investigations were designed to identify prehistoric and historic
archeological sites and all other cultural resources located within the approximately 4.89 miles of
preexisting right-of-way along SH 71 between Bee Cave and Austin in Travis County, Texas.
This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. to locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey area
2. to assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and for SAL designation
All cultural resources were identified through a program of background research for potential
sites and an intensive pedestrian survey with judgmental shovel testing, using the field
methodology described below.

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Prior to undertaking intensive pedestrian survey, historic maps of the area and the Texas
Historical Commissionâs Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online electronic records were
consulted, in conjunction with a literature search. These efforts identified five previously
conducted surveys (see Chapter 3) and 32 previously recorded archeological sites (see Table 1)
within 1 km of the project area. Eight of these sites could potentially occur within the project
area:
41TV319, 41TV397, 41TV1023, 41TV1024, 41TV1027, 41TV1892, 41TV2123,
41TV2124. These sites are discussed at the beginning of Chapter 3.
In addition to the archeological sites in the area, three cemeteries are also located within 1 km of
the project area. Only North Bohls Cemetery is adjacent to the project area. This cemetery is at
the northern end of the APE on the east side of SH 71. Uplands Ridge Drive appears to go
through the original location of the cemetery. However, based on aerial photos of the location, a
portion of the cemetery may still exist, and there may also be the potential for unmarked graves
along the edge of the right-of-way. Thus, the pedestrian survey will focus attention on
35

determining the relationship between North Bohls cemetery and the APE. Although this project
will not expand the right-of-way, attempts will be made to determine whether grave shafts do
exist in the current right-of-way by contacting a cemetery association (if one exists) or locating a
funeral home that might have information, or by conducting some scraping within the right-ofway to visually look for shafts. If oral information is sufficient or no shafts are found from the
scraping, no monitoring or other work will be required at this location prior to road construction
within the project area.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
Two GMI archeologists conducted pedestrian survey by walking a single transect or two parallel
transects, as determined by the Project Archeologist. On single transects, shovel tests were
excavated in leapfrog fashion, and on parallel transects each archeologist excavated shovel tests
along the transect. Prior to fieldwork, the APE was translated from a CADD file into a Shapefile
and was then uploaded onto a Trimble global positioning system (GPS) backpack unit. This
Trimble unit recorded the location of the judgmental shovel tests and assisted with the orientation
of the field crew. Upon completion of fieldwork, the collected GPS data were downloaded and
then later used as the basis for the maps presented in this report. The Project Archeologist
maintained field notes that documented survey conditions, vegetation cover, area covered daily,
and initial interpretations of cultural properties. In addition, the Project Archeologist kept a
photograph log that identified each photograph taken.
Examination of topographical maps, basic knowledge of regional archeological site distribution
patterning, and visual inspection of the landforms at the time of survey in combination with the
observed soil profiles from shovel tests formed the basis for determining the intensity of
investigation and the placement of judgmental shovel tests within the project area. The entire
project area is considered to be of low probability because it is composed almost entirely of
upland deposits that have been impacted by road-building activities, utility construction, private
development, and erosion. Therefore, it was recommended that shovel tests be judgmentally
placed, but in accordance with current survey standards for linear projects (e.g., a minimum of 16
shovel tests per linear mile) as approved by the Texas Historical Commission. It was also agreed
that shovel tests would be excavated in areas where ground cover hindered site detection or in
areas of high site probability such as along creek margins. Should areas along the project
corridor be identified as having been previously altered or impacted (e.g., exhibiting urban
sprawl, buried utilities, highway construction, etc.) or exhibiting large areas of bedrock at the
surface, shovel tests were not excavated but photodocumented only. During fieldwork, all
exposed surface areas such as road cuts, animal burrows, and plowed fields were closely
inspected for cultural material. Also, backhoe trenching was not deemed necessary on this
project since the proposed construction impacts along the corridor are not expected to be any
deeper than 3 ft in depth (with the exception of Barton Creek), and that depth can usually be
examined in shovel test units. At Barton Creek, there are no Quaternary soils identified and are
not expected to contain cultural materials. Though the pillars for the bridge may go as deep as
15+ ft to the creek bottom and exposed bedrock, bedrock is rather shallow outside of the creek
bed and shovel tests would sufficient.
A total of 36 shovel tests was excavated during this survey. The location of each shovel test was
individually recorded as a GPS point during the survey area. The 36 excavation units do not meet
the minimum requirements established by the Texas Historical Commission guidelines for a
36

project area of this size and configuration, but this is because the majority of the APE was
disturbed. These disturbed areas account for 90 percent of the project area and include graded
road cut bedrock outcrops, heavily eroded surfaces, and/or areas with slopes greater than 20
percent that are byproducts of road-building activities. All of these disturbed areas were closely
examined for cultural materials before being photodocumented. Judgmental shovel tests were
excavated in those areas still containing intact deposits, roughly 10 percent of the project area. In
all cases, shovel tests measured approximately 30 cm in diameter and were excavated either to the
top of the Bt-horizon (subsoil) or to 80 cm below ground surface. The soil from each shovel test
was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) hardware cloth, and each shovel test was backfilled.
No artifactual material was identified during this present survey. Nonetheless, had cultural
resources been encountered, GMI would have followed standard procedures to delineate site
boundaries. When a cultural artifact is encountered, either surface or subsurface, a series of four
shovel tests in a cruciform pattern (one in each cardinal direction) around the initial find is
excavated. If no further cultural remains are located, the original artifact is recorded as an
isolated find (or locality), photographed, and recorded in field notes; GPS data are recorded, the
isolate is plotted on applicable topographic maps, and the survey continues.
If cultural material is located in any of the additional shovel tests, the find is recorded as a site,
and shovel testing continues in the cruciform pattern until two sterile shovel tests are encountered
to fully delineate the site extent within the project corridor. The additional shovel tests are used
to obtain estimates of the site depth, contents, and integrity. Site designation is applied only to
clusters of surface artifacts (i.e., greater than 10 artifacts), clusters of subsurface artifacts (two or
more positive shovel tests), or significant architectural properties. Each recorded site is identified
with a permanent datum marker consisting of a 5/8-inch-diameter metal rebar stake placed on the
site. This marker is topped with an aluminum cap bearing the siteâs temporary GMI field
number, and the site datum location is recorded using GPS. A scaled pace-and-compass map
and/or collected GPS data identify shovel test locations, cultural and topographic features,
generalized contour intervals, and vegetation areas. The site is photographed from several
viewpoints with a digital camera; any damage from vandalism, construction, or earth disturbances
is also photodocumented. These photographs are recorded in a photo log. A State of Texas site
recording form is prepared, noting locational information, vegetation cover, contextual integrity,
estimated period of occupation, and artifactual material (both surface and subsurface). The site
location is plotted on the appropriate project and topographic maps.
All artifacts recovered from shovel tests on both site and nonsite (isolated occurrence) areas are
collected. Wherever possible, limited surface collections of temporally and/or functionally
diagnostic artifacts are also made to expand the sample of materials used in evaluating the
cultural affiliation, age, and other research-potential issues about the site.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
No artifactual material was recovered during this project. However, had material been found, all
artifacts would have been transported to the GMI laboratory and subjected to standard procedures
of cleaning, analyzing, and labeling. The first step in the process involves the cleaning of
artifacts in the most appropriate method per artifact as determined by GMI laboratory personnel.
Once cleaned, the artifacts are sorted through visual inspection and separated into prehistoric,
historic, and ecofact (faunal and vegetal remains) material. A specialist then analyses each and
records such information as material type, style, function, and metric attributes.
37

Prehistoric lithics are analyzed for specific attributes, defining chipped stone tools (biface
[including projectile points], uniface, edge modified flake, utilized/modified cobble tool),
debitage (flake, shatter, core), ground stone (mano, metate, pestle, pendant, etc.), and fire-cracked
rock. Prehistoric ceramics are analyzed for identification of vessel portion (body, rim, base),
temper, decoration, etc., to allow placement of each sherd into named types when possible.
Burned clay fragments with no indication of vessel structure (i.e., lacking temper, decoration,
etc.) are identified either as baked clay (the result of unintentional firing as in hearth remains) or
as daub (used for shelter construction).
Historic materials are analyzed to determine objects for domestic (e.g., ceramics, glass, tableware,
lamp fragments), architectural (nails, brick, window glass), activities (farm-, transportation-,
weapons-related), or personal (e.g., doll/doll parts, perfume bottles, comb) consumption.
Unidentifiable fragments of metal and glass with no ability to provide specific information are
classified as âunidentifiedâ and simply counted as present among the assemblage.
Ecofacts represent faunal and vegetal remains onsite that was likely altered in some way to reflect
human occupation. Such material may be shell, faunal bone, or seed representing food
consumption or personal decoration, charcoal remains from hearths, and wood remains used as
shelter or fuel. When possible, ecofacts are analyzed to the species level to help in determining
specific subsistence economies and time periods of site occupation.
After the analyses of the artifactual materials are complete, all recorded attributes for each artifact
are entered into an ACCESS database on an IBM network system. Computer printouts are
compiled and archived with the permanent project files.

CURATED MATERIAL
Although no artifacts were recovered, all records and materials generated from this project were
returned to the GMI laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas, and labeled or recorded in compliance
with TARL standards. All documents and materials related to this project will be permanently
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, upon
completion of the project (Appendix A).

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

INTRODUCTION
As a result of the present survey, a total of 36 shovel tests was excavated within the 4.89 miles of
proposed linear road widening with a bridge replacement along SH 71 between Bee Cave and
Austin in Travis County. Thirty-two sites have been previously recorded within the 1-km study
radius of the APE, but only eight (41TV319, 41TV397, 41TV1023, 41TV1024, 41TV1027,
41TV1892, 41TV2123, 41TV2124) were identified as potentially occurring within the project
area. In addition to these sites, there was initial concern as to the relationship between North
Bohls Cemetery and the APE. This chapter provides an overview of the survey corridor and
previously recorded sites potentially within the APE, work conducted, and a discussion of the
findings by segment of corridor beginning at the northern end and concluding at the southern end.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES
POTENTIALLY WITHIN THE APE
The eight previously recorded archeological sites are summarized individually, presenting the
work conducted within the ROW to identify the presence of each site. No evidence of any of
these sites was found within the ROW. All site locations and judgmental shovel tests are
indicated in Figures 4 and 5. When known, the site boundaries are shown on the figures.
However, in some cases, the site limits are not available because only the site center was recorded
and plotted during previous surveys.

North Bohls Cemetery
The first priority of this fieldwork was to assess the spatial relationship between the northern
terminus of the project area and North Bohls Cemetery. Prior to survey, the only spatial reference
available for this cemetery was based on the 1986 USGS topographic map. Further development,
including the construction of Uplands Ridge Drive, is known to have occurred in this location
based on the aerial photographs. Georeferencing the topographic map with the aerial photographs
indicated Uplands Ridge Drive passes through North Bohls Cemetery, and because of this
39

apparent overlap it was uncertain as to where the cemetery actually lay in reference to the road.
Therefore, there was concern about the potential for marked or unmarked graves to be within the
APE (see Figure 4).
The results of this survey determined that the west facing, fenced boundary of North Bohls
Cemetery is approximately 68 m (224 ft) northeast of the intersection of SH 71 and Uplands
Ridge Drive. Since the undertaking is limited to the existing SH 71 ROW at this locale and is
located approximately 50 m (164 ft) west of the cemeteryâs western boundary, it is the
investigatorsâ opinion that minimal potential exists for any associated unmarked graves to be
present within the APE. These observations were confirmed by two local surveyors for the City
of Austin water company. These surveyors were asked about the presence of a cemetery on the
undeveloped lot at the intersection of Uplands Ridge Drive and SH 71. They stated that while
involved in marking the 1999 water line they found no evidence of any cemetery on the northeast
corner of the private property owned by Mr. Wong. Mr. Wongâs property is located on the
northside of SH 71 beginning at Uplands Ridge Drive and extending southeast along the edge of
SH 71 and through the APE for approximately 326 m. Exhaustive visual inspection of the
property by GMI archeologists failed to identify any headstones. Furthermore, no areas of soil
deposits exceeding 20â30 cm in depth were within the vicinity. Ground surface visibility was 50
percent or higher in most areas, and no surficial evidence of any grave shafts, skeletal material, or
grave goods was observed.
After Mr. Wongâs property was inspected, GMI archeologists proceeded to the opposite side of
Uplands Ridge Drive and located the cemetery. North Bohls Cemetery was observed on top of a
3â5-ft ridge of intact limestone bedrock between Uplands Ridge Drive and the parking lot of a
nearby strip mall (Figure 6). The cemetery contains a series of large concrete slabs with
headstones on the slabs and dates to the mid-1900s (Figure 7). The bedrock on which the parking
lot and Uplands Ridge Drive are situated (surrounding the cemetery) has been graded and is
lower than the cemetery ground. Thus, based on gathered information and observation of the area
immediately adjacent to the cemetery and within Mr. Wongâs undeveloped lot, the entire North
Bohls Cemetery lies within the fenced portion of the present cemetery along the top of the
limestone ridge. Therefore, no potential exists for marked or unmarked graves to be encountered
within the APE.

Site 41TV319
Site 41TV319 was originally recorded by Moore (1975) and then later revisited by Nichols
(1979). It consisted of a small, diffuse lithic scatter on a terrace overlooking the confluence of
Barton and Little Barton creeks. Reportedly, the site was heavily impacted by a rodeo arena, and
no further work was recommended (see Figure 4).
Current observations reveal the distance between the plotted site center and the western edge of
the APE is estimated at roughly 200 ft. It is also apparent that the Barton Creek terrace within the
APE is immediately adjacent to the southern Barton Creek bridge support and carries a heavily
eroded yet maintained gravel road (Figure 8). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that any of the
terrace remains intact or that the diffuse lithic scatter continues into the APE in this location. No
cultural materials or indication of the site were found within the ROW.

Site 41TV397
Site 41TV397 was recorded as several historic standing log structures on a terrace north of the
confluence of Barton and Little Barton creeks (Voellinger 1979). The site was nominated to the
National Register of Historic Places, but whether it was accepted is unknown.
The area is on the west side of SH 71 and presently lies between Spanish Oaks Club Boulevard
and Barton Creek (see Figure 4). The area within the APE is relatively flat, which is likely a
byproduct of the combined SH 71 construction activities, deposition of materials from the
highway ditch, and construction activities associated with a water or sewer line that parallels the
western edge of the APE (Figure 9). A total of six shovel tests was placed along the western edge
of the ROW in this location; all indicated the upper 20â30 cm of disturbed soil overlying intact
sterile clays. No cultural materials or indications of site 41TV397 were found within the ROW.

Site 41TV1023
Site 41TV1023 was recorded in 1985 during the same Manorwood Development survey that
recorded sites 41TV1024 and 41TV1027. The site was described as being on a noticeable
landform along the west side of SH 71 (about 1.5 miles from the southern end of the current
project area) and consisted of a large lithic scatter (see Figure 5). Two Middle Archaic projectile
point bases were recovered in conjunction with debitage representing all stages of reduction.
However, due to erosion, land clearing, lack of soil depth, and lack of archeological features, the

site was not recommended for further work (Gearhart and Katz 1985a. The site boundary
according to the THC online Archeological Site Atlas does not overlap with the western boundary
of the APE.
Currently, soils on top of the graded and cut rock outcrop near the intersection of SH 71 and
Thomas Springs Road are very thin (< 20 cm). Numerous gravels and sections of bedrock are
visible through the thin blanket of grass that lies directly beneath an overhead utility line (Figure
10). The ROW in this section has been graded to remove the majority of the overburden in
combination with the slanting road cut, likely due to engineering concerns about the integrity of
the rock outcrop. This survey failed to confirm any cultural materials near the reported location
of this site within the ROW.

Site 41TV1024
Site 41TV1024 was recorded during the same Manorwood Development survey that identified
sites 41TV1023 and 41TV1027. The site was recorded on a terrace downslope and to the north of
site 41TV1023 (see Figure 5). The site was identified on the observation of a low-density lithic
scatter. No further work was recommended on this site due to a lack of diagnostics and the
presence of thin soils (Gearhart and Katz 1985b).
Current investigations revealed that as the APE moves uphill toward the plotted site center, it
becomes apparent that the bedrock has been graded in this area to remove the overburden and
reduce the potential collapse of the slanted road cut (Figure 11). The soils upslope continue to

thin (< 20 cm) and there are obvious run-off erosional channels present on the side of the road
cut. No cultural material was observed on the surface in this area or within any of the erosional
run-off channels within the ROW.

Site 41TV1027
Site 41TV1027 was recorded in 1985 during a survey for the proposed, but never constructed,
Manorwood Development (sites 41TV1023 and 41TV1024 were also identified during this same
survey). This site was recorded on the lower benches of the south slope of Dittmar Hill, a
prominent knoll in the area. The site center was plotted more than 300 ft. beyond the western
edge of the current ROW. Artifacts collected during the initial survey included projectile points
diagnostic of the Paleo-Indian, Early Archaic, and Late Archaic periods and debitage from all
stages of reduction. Burned limestone was also reportedly scattered over the site area. Despite
these materials, the site was not recommended for further work due to the shallow soil depth and
heavy erosion. The recorders reported that the observed and collected materials may have
washed down from higher up on Dittmar Hill and thus represented secondary deposits, which
further questioned the integrity of the artifacts and the site (Gearhart and Katz 1985c).
Currently, the APE near the reported plotting of the site was visually inspected for a stretch of
200 meters. Unfortunately, the APE in this location has been adversely affected by SH 71
construction activities, private development in the form of road building and subsequent erosion.
The ground surface in this location is covered by a thin soil with large limestone gravels and
areas of bedrock clearly visible (Figure 12). No shovel tests were excavated in this location
because the soils were too thin. The walkover survey of the area failed to recover any cultural
material or reveal any indication of the site in the APE.

Site 41TV1892
Site 41TV1892 was recorded in 1999 during a survey for the Northern Hays and SW Travis
County Water Supply Line, which has since been constructed. The site was recorded on the west
side of SH 71 (see Figure 5). The site consisted of an east-west, 1â2-course high, dry-laid
limestone wall above a small unnamed intermittent drainage of Barton Creek. No other cultural
materials were observed associated with the wall and no further work was recommended
(Malmros 1999).
Current investigations failed to find any evidence of this reported limestone wall (Figure 13).
Thus, this site does not exist within the APE.

Site 41TV2123
Site 41TV2123 was recorded during a 2005 West Travis County (WTC) pipeline survey as site
41TV2124 (Skeete 2005a). Whether the proposed pipeline that initiated this survey has been
constructed remains unconfirmed, but based on ground surface inspection, no construction
appears to have taken place. Site 41TV2123 was recorded as being on a terrace above Barton
Creek along the east side of SH 71 approximately 1.25 miles from the northern end of the project
area (see Figure 4). As recorded, the site consisted of a low-density lithic scatter in conjunction

with historic bottles, a barbeque pit, and a septic tank. The site was considered to have the
potential for extending into the current ROW because of its reported location adjacent to the
eastern ROW boundary.
Current inspection of the area within the ROW adjacent to the plotted site location indicates the
area includes a slight rise more similar to a natural knoll than a terrace. The ROW near this
plotted site location has been adversely impacted by the slanted grading of bedrock resulting from
road construction (Figure 14). The combined impacts of the road cut and the subsequent erosion
of the area has left large portions of exposed bedrock with little or no topsoil. No cultural
material or evidence of site 41TV2123 extends into the ROW.

14. Overview of the purported location of site 41TV2123, looking northeast

Figure 14. Overview of the purported location of site 41TV2123, looking northeast.

Site 41TV2124
Site 41TV2124 was recorded in 2005 during the same WTC pipeline survey, for which the
pipeline may or may not have been constructed. The site is located approximately one-quarter
mile south from the northern end of the project area along the east side of the highway. This site
was initially identified on the basis of a low-density lithic scatter (Skeete 2005b). The site was
reported to have the potential to extend north and east of the current site boundary, and no formal
recommendations about the site were made. This site was considered to potentially extend into
the APE because of its undefined boundaries (see Figure 4).

51

During the present investigations, the ROW area adjacent to the reported location of the site was
visually inspected and tested through the excavation of three judgmental shovel tests. All three
shovel tests were sterile and indicated the presence of shallow disturbed deposits. The water line
mentioned in the discussion of North Bohls Cemetery extends along the entire east side of SH 71
from the intersection of Uplands Ridge Drive to the Barton Creek bridge; therefore, it runs
through the ROW in this location. In addition, there is an overhead utility line and an eroded
two-track road in this location (Figure 15). This section of the ROW has been adversely affected
by various utility activities and subsequent erosion. No cultural materials or evidence of this site
were identified in the ROW.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT AREA BY SEGMENT
The majority of the project area (roughly 90 percent or 95 acres) is disturbed. The disturbed areas
are largely the result of heavily eroded road cuts that have been further impacted by construction
of utilities such as power lines, fiber optics cables, and water lines. In addition, there is a small
stretch of sewer pipe installed near the location of site 41TV319 and obvious grading and refilling
activities associated with a gravel road near the Barton Creek bridge. The majority of the ROW
on both sides of the 4.89 miles of SH 71 proposed for widening between Bee Cave and Austin
contains eroded two-track roads with exposed large gravels and bedrock, which are the remnants
of older roads and maintenance roads used for the various utilities within or at the edge of the
ROW. The following discussion briefly summarizes the progression of the survey and the
observed disturbances beginning at the northernmost terminus of the project areaâthe
52

intersection of SH 71 and Uplands Ridge Driveâand concluding at the intersection of SH 71 and
Silvermine Drive at the south end of the APE. The discussion is broken into segments based on
natural barriers such as creeks and major intersections. The extent of each segment is defined at
the outset of each discussion (see Figures 4 and 5).

Segment #1: Intersection of SH 71 and Uplands Ridge Drive to Barton Creek
Segment #1 begins at the northern terminus of the project area at the intersection of Uplands
Ridge Drive and SH 71 and continues southward to the north side of the Barton Creek bridge.
Prior to this survey, North Bohls Cemetery and archeological sites 41TV2124 and 41TV397 were
identified as potentially being within the ROW in this segment. The survey of this segment
carefully investigated the areas closest to these cultural resources, but failed to recover any
evidence of them within the APE.
The eastern ROW of SH 71 within this segment, including the area near site 41TV2124, is
disturbed. The property at the northeast corner of the intersection of Uplands Ridge Drive and
SH 71 owned by Mr. Wong is an empty commercial lot with both overhead utilities and a water
line that parallel the eastern edge of the ROW (Figure 16). The water line constructed in 1999 by
the City of Austin (Figure 17) included an archeological survey (see Chapter 3). In addition to
the water line, overhead utilities and an eroded two-track maintenance road are within the ROW
(Figure 18). These features occupy nearly the entire eastern ROW in this segment except for a
small area across from Spanish Oaks Club Boulevard that is graded bedrock (Figure 19).
Therefore, no shovel tests were conducted in the eastern ROW of this segment.

The western portion of the ROW in this segment has been adversely affected by development and
grading, aside from one small section that was judgmentally shovel-tested but found to be sterile.
The northern portion of the ROW extending from the intersection of Uplands Ridge Drive to the
edge of the hill has been impacted by the development of two golf cart sales lots and driveways
for private residences (Figure 20). The slope down to Barton Creek is riddled with large
erosional gullies and exposures of bedrock visible on the surface (Figure 21). Although a small
terrace just to the north of Spanish Oaks Club Boulevard has been graded flat to remove the
overburden from the bedrock, intact sediments were observed near an older oak tree. A total of
four shovel tests was excavated on this graded area. The deepest deposits observed were to a
depth of 45 cm below surface near the one lone oak at the juncture of the slope and the graded
area, but all shovel tests were sterile (Figure 22). This segment included the addition of 0.03
acres of proposed new ROW adjacent to the area judgmentally shovel tested north of Spanish
Oaks Club Boulevard. This additional 10 feet of proposed new ROW will not likely produce any
cultural material since this area has also been eroded. The remainder of the southern portion of
this segment, south of Spanish Oaks Club Boulevard was the area tested for site 41TV319, which
as previously noted was disturbed.

Segment #2: Southside of Barton Creek to Thomas Springs Road/Old Bee Caves Road
Segment 2 starts on the southern side of Barton Creek and continues southward to Thomas
Springs Road. Sites 41TV319, 41TV1892, 41TV1023, 41TV1024, and 41TV2123 were plotted
as potentially extending into this segment. The eastern side of the ROW in this segment south of
Barton Creek begins with an area that has been impacted by slope wash and highway
construction. Two judgmental shovel tests were excavated on each side of a two-track road
accessing a utility support station associated with the overhead utilities that span the entire length
of the ROW. The shovel test closer to Barton Creek was disturbed, and the more southern,
upslope unit indicated intact but sterile sediments (Figures 23 and 24).
The next property in the eastern ROW, upslope toward site 41TV2123, is well manicured and
related to a development that includes a retaining wall. Soils are shallow in this location because
the bedrock has been graded for nearly the entire upslope portion of the ROW on this hill (see
Figure 10). As the ROW approaches the crest of the hill and site 41TV2123, it becomes a series
of slanted road cuts with large exposures of bedrock and gravels (Figure 25). These exposures
increase in size and continue past the location of the site 41TV2123 until reaching the boundary
of the Nature Conservancy property on top of the hill.
The roadbed in front of the Nature Conservancy property has been raised above the level of the
surrounding landscape, which likely includes the scraping and piling of materials from the edge
of the ROW in addition to laying down fill. The placement of additional fill in this location is a
necessity due to the steep slope, which can be easily identified on the topographic maps.

#2.

Evidence in support of these hypotheses includes the drainage ditch in the ROW showing the
presence of exposed gravels and bedrock in this area (Figure 26). This general construction trend
of manipulating the ROW through ditch digging, piling, and filling continues for the majority of
the way between the downslope to the south and the next hill that overlooks Southwest Parkway.
It is worth noting that at roughly the halfway point upslope of this next southerly hill, there is a
section of ROW that is in active use as a dumping site for soil and construction debris (Figure
27).
The top of the hill involves another major fill operation that has covered the entire eastern ROW
with a thick, slanting layer of road fill (Figure 28). The fill in this location is likely the spoils of
the hill from which the road was cut, which was then used as the embankment for the present
roadbed. The deep fill continues through the eastern ROW and makes it impossible to shovel test
until reaching the crest of the next hill. The hilltop south of the Southwest Parkway and SH 71
intersection and nearly the majority of this hill upslope and downslope have been graded,
exposing the underlying bedrock (Figure 29). The downslope and bottom area between this
hilltop and the next compose the last leg of the eastern ROW in this segment before reaching
Thomas Springs Road. This area includes a deeply incised drainage ditch and an intermittent runoff creek with exposed bedrock. The final upslope to Thomas Springs Road is composed of
graded and exposed bedrock that includes a small stand of scrub brush near the midpoint (Figure
30).

Figure 30. Graded slope with eroded drainage ditch and intermittent run-off creek bed, eastern ROW, Segment #2,
looking north.

The western portion of the ROW in this segment begins at the Barton Creek bridge as a highly
eroded two-track roadbed that includes a USGS water gauge station (Figure 31). Southward from
this point is the upslope for the first hill, on top of which is site 41TV2123 in the eastern ROW.
Several older stands of trees are located within the lower third of this slope, and this area was
judgmentally shovel-tested (Figure 32). The shovel tests indicated the presence of intact but
sterile soils. The remainder of this upslope between these shovel tests and the paved parking lot
on top of the hill across from site 41TV2123 has been graded, is heavily eroded, and has sections
of the seed matting still visible on the surface (Figure 33).
The parking lot on top of the hill is a large area of fill being used to support the roadbed of SH 71
in this area due to the 100-ft cliff at this location. The parking lot and associated fill occupy the
entire western ROW. The slope on each side of this parking lot is greater than 20 percent and
therefore exempted from shovel testing. After passing through this section of 20 percent slopes,
the ROW is dominated by several private concrete drives associated with affluent housing
developments such as the Mandreons. These drives in combination with the overhead power
lines and a heavily eroded two-track road have all adversely impacted the ROW until it reaches a
stand of older growth trees near the bottom of the saddle between this hilltop and the next (Figure
34).
The saddle area between the hills was judgmentally shovel-tested. These shovel tests indicated
the presence of an unknown water source in one location as observed by the presence of standing
water in the shovel test, while the others revealed intact but sterile sequences. Based on the
recent ROW revisions, the area north of these judgmental shovel tests included the addition of
0.06 acres of new ROW. This 10-ft-wide area included a heavily eroded two-track road and a
location of standing water.

The area southward from this location begins to climb upslope again and has been adversely
impacted by the placement of more driveways (paved and unpaved), additional overhead utilities,
and a heavily eroded two-track (Figure 35). At the top of the hill that overlooks Southwest
Parkway is a graded bedrock road cut with heavily eroded soils on both the upslope and the
downslope (see Figure 12). The downslope of this hill is near the location of site 41TV1027,
discussed previously in this chapter. Also included in the recent highway design revisions is a an
additional 0.7 acres in the location near and adjacent to site 41TV1027. Though the additionally
proposed new ROW varies in width from 10 to 40 ft, it has all been adversely impacted by the
first stages of the failed Manorwood Development development that includes construction of a
two-track road. Subsequent erosion has further removed the majority of the top soil in the area
stripping the area of any contextual integrity.

After passing south and downslope of the SH 71 and Southwest Parkway intersection, the ROW
becomes additionally impacted by the presence of an older City of Austin water line along the
outside edge of the ROW. The low area between this hill and the next was filled with standing
water and untestable, while the upslope area on the other side to the south lacks soil due to the
grading of the bedrock and subsequent erosion (Figure 36). The ROW then rises to a flat graded
area of bedrock that has been further impacted by placement of a fiber optics cable along the
outside edge of the ROW. This small flattened area is largely exposed bedrock and after passing
near the purported but unconfirmed location of site 41TV1892, the land dips into another area of
standing water (see Figure 13). As the slope rises toward Thomas Springs Road, there is a small
terrace of intact sediments near several older trees. Two judgmental shovel tests excavated on
this terrace confirmed the integrity of the sediments but were sterile.

Figure 36. Overview of area with City of Austin water line south of Southwest Parkway, western ROW, Segment #2,

After passing over this terrace, the ROW begins to climb upslope and passes by sites 41TV1024
and 41TV1023. There was no evidence of either site identified in the ROW because of grading
and little soil remaining due to heavy erosion (see Figures 10 and 11). There are patches of
bedrock and large cobbles visible through the thin layer of grass. The utilities continue through
this area, with evidence of pushpiles near the intersection of SH 71 and Thomas Springs Road.

Segment #3: Thomas Springs Road/Old Bee Caves Road to Silvermine Drive
Less survey has been conducted in the vicinity of Segment 3 than in any other part of the project
area. The segment is more gently sloped to the south and southeast, but a large portion of this
segment on both sides of SH 71 has been disturbed by recent grading activities and development.
The portion of the eastern ROW near Thomas Springs Road has a gentle slope to the south and a
ditch with patches of exposed gravels and bedrock. The area is largely disturbed as a result of
grading activities, the continuation of a City of Austin buried water line, and erosion (Figure 37).
This general sequence continues until the gentle slope evens out at the Marx property. An
additional 0.1 acre of new ROW has been proposed along the east side of SH 71 south of Old Bee
Cave road. This 10-ft-wide area has been extensively scraped by private developers in an attempt
to lessen the severity of the slope from the development properties to the existing SH 71.

Figure 37. Overview of the northern portion of the segment ROW, eastern ROW, Segment #3, looking northwest.

The Marx property is a well-maintained property that has been in the same family for two
generations (Mr. Marx, personal communication 2007). Mr. Marx related that he was born on the
property in the 1920s; he described the road building activities and shared his knowledge about
the land use history of his property and the surrounding area. A total of eight judgmental shovel
tests was excavated within the ROW in front of the Marx property (Figure 38). The
southeasternmost shovel test indicated disturbed deposits likely the byproduct of SH 71
construction activities. The remaining seven indicated intact but sterile sequences with a general
thinning of the deposits toward the northwest as the ground rose. Mr. Marx stated that he has
never seen or collected any âarrowheadsâ on his property.
An additional 0.2 acres of new ROW is proposed along the eastern edge of SH 71 near Mr.
Marxâs property. The area within the ROW was extensively shovel tested as indicated above.
These shovel tests indicated there was intact soil but no cultural resources present. This new 10ft-wide area immediately adjacent to the existing ROW is no different in appearance from that
within the ROW. Since there was no right-of entry at the time of the survey, and based on the
information that Mr. Marx has never seen cultural materials on his property and shovel tests
immediately along the edge of the current ROW showed no indication of cultural materials, it is
extrapolated that the newly proposed ROW likewise contains no cultural resources.
After passing the Marx property, ROW land rises to meet a low-lying, graded bedrock road cut
that has a thin layer of soil on the northwestern end that thickens farther to the southeast. Two
judgmental shovel tests were excavated near a stand of older trees in a lower-lying area (Figure
39). The westernmost shovel tests indicated the deposits were disturbed and less than 20 cm in
depth despite older trees being present, while the eastern shovel test had an intact but sterile
sequence.

The remainder of the eastern side of the ROW includes a small intermittent drainage wet area
near a guardrail and then a gentle rise around a curve, intersecting with a pump station for the
City of Austin wastewater and water systems. These water lines continue to the northwest and
southeast closely following the edge of the ROW. The ROW from this pump station extending to
the southeast has been adversely impacted due to apparent recent (within the last roughly 5 years)
installment of concrete box culverts and grading of the ROW (Figure 40). The box culverts are
present at each driveway from this pump station to Silvermine Drive and are in combination with
an excavated ditch showing visible evidence of seed matting (Figure 41). There are also several
patches of heavily eroded ROW and swampy areas due to standing water. This portion of the
eastern ROW has been disturbed. Three separate additional locations totaling another 0.2 acres of
newly proposed ROW was indicated in this segment of the SH 71. These 10-ft-wide areas
contain the same impacts as the current ROW.

Figure

The western portion of the ROW beginning at the intersection of Thomas Springs Road/Old Bee
Caves Road and SH 71 has been disturbed by the construction of underground utilities and a gas
station. The western ROW southward from this point to opposite the Marx property has been
adversely affected by gas station, church, business, and private residence development (Figure
42). Box culverts are located at each drive, and an excavated ditch and utilities are evident
throughout the ROW.

The area opposite the Marx property in the western ROW appears to have been graded based on
the nature of the ground and the remnants of seed matting on the surface of the ROW. Despite
these observations, three judgmental shovel tests were excavated close to older stands of trees in
the ROW (Figure 43). All three shovel tests were sterile but indicated intact soil sequences with
minor disturbance at the very top of the sequence.

Figure 43. Overview of the location of judgmental shovel tests across the road from the Marx house, western ROW,

As the western ROW continues southward, SH 71 makes a gentle bend more southeasterly, which
is the location of the two judgmental shovel tests in the eastern ROW. Two shovel tests were
excavated in the western ROW at this point, near the large trees; these tests indicated shallow but
intact and sterile deposits (Figure 44). The remainder of the ROW has been disturbed by road
construction activities and private development. The ROW area south of these two judgmental
shovel tests, across from the pump station, has been disturbed by the recent construction of a new
guardrail, as well as ROW grading as observed through seed matting remains on the surface
(Figure 45). This general pattern of ROW disturbance continues upslope until reaching the
development at the intersection of Covered Bridge Drive and SH 71.
The ROW at the development on Covered Bridge Drive is manicured and has several utilities
running through the westernmost edge. A retaining wall is located on the outer edge of the ROW.
The soils are thin and the area has been graded (Figure 46). The final leg, extending from
Covered Bride Drive to Silvermine Drive, has also been disturbed by apparently recent (within
the last roughly 5 years) installment of concrete box culverts and ROW grading (see Figure 41).
Several patches of heavily eroded ROW and swampy areas due to standing water were observed
in the western ROW as well.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The archeological survey of the 4.89 miles of proposed linear road widening and bridge
replacement within the existing ROW along SH 71 between Bee Cave and Austin was designed
to investigate the project area for previously undocumented cultural resources, reassess any
previously recorded archeological sites, and collect sufficient data for the evaluation of the
eligibility of each property for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark. No evidence of any previously recorded site or
any cultural material was recovered during this survey (see Chapter 5). This chapter provides a
more detailed discussion of the NRHP and SAL criteria and presents recommendations for future
treatment of these resources.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

Eligibility for Inclusion in the NRHP
Cultural resources must meet specific criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the National Register.
By definition, an eligible resource is a âhistoric propertyâ:
âHistoric propertyâ means any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included
in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register. This term includes . . . artifacts, records, and
remains that are related to and located within such properties. The term âeligible for inclusion in the
National Registerâ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior
and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria [36 CFR 800.2].

The cultural resources discussed in this report were evaluated according to criteria based on
federal regulations for determining the significance of those resources for inclusion in the NRHP.
Determinations of eligibility for NRHP inclusion are applied following the identification of
relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
75

(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR Â§ 60.4].

Generally, Criterion âdâ is most often applied to prehistoric sites, but can also be relevant to
many historic sites. âImportant informationâ is usually recognized as referring to scientific
importance. However, scientific importance is partially driven by the research perspectives of the
time and in part by the state of available information regarding a particular research topic in a
specific research area. The purpose for conducting archeology should not be to fill museum
drawers with relics, but rather to fill informational gaps relating to specific research domains. As
research progresses within a region, well-excavated sites contribute information to some of those
research domains. Through time, data needs for some research questions may be addressed to
various degrees, even though complementary data are often needed from different periods,
seasons, settings, and site types to fully understand the diversity of activities. As data required to
address specific questions approach redundancy, such information may diminish the priority of
that kind of repetitive information needed from nearby sites. This suggests that the identification
criteria of important historic properties are tied to both a specific geographical area, reflecting a
cultural adaptation or region, and a state of accumulated knowledge about a research domain.
Archeological sites with integrity containing artifacts and features that can contribute information
toward addressing research issues are regarded as significant and are eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP.
Archeological sites that exist on static landforms, such as bedrock surfaces or ancient upland
hilltops that lack eolian sands, can contain concentrated densities of artifacts and feature remains.
Such âpalimpsestâ remains of occupations are generally regarded as having very little or no
research potential for contributing useful information toward the understanding of prehistory,
because the artifact assemblages are mixed and not interpretable. In such cases, the sites are not
regarded as scientifically important, and in general, these kinds of sites are not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
The most ideal kinds of archeological remains are those left in rapidly aggrading settings, where
there is a chance for noncultural sediments to separate a series of materials and residues
representing brief, short-term activities. Usually, aggrading alluvial, wind-blown, or eolian sand
sheets and dunes, and sometimes colluvial slopewash, are the kinds of settings and events that are
apt to quickly bury archeological remains and preserve the discreteness of activities. The
evaluation of the depositional potential is one of the key characteristics for distinguishing the
integrity of deposits.
Information is useless in a vacuum. Thus, the first criterion of significance for any archeological
property within the APE is considered to be its capability to yield relevant information. Whether
or not specific archeological properties exhibit such potential or contain data relevant to any
particular historic context or research theme is dependent upon a precondition of contextual
integrity of the archeological deposits. For example, a prehistoric site buried by sediment within
an aggrading river levee has a far greater potential for containing undisturbed deposits than one
located on an eroding upland surface. The nature of contextual integrity as it affects research
76

potential of a property, must, however, also be viewed as relative, since different research
problems require different types of data.

Eligibility for Inclusion in the SAL Program
At the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1.
2.

The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
The archeological site is situated on private land which has been specifically designated as an SAL
. . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the siteâs original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

The 4.89 miles of preexisting ROW along SH 71 is being developed by TxDOT, whose existence
is due to State of Texas enabling legislation. Thus, the condition as an entity of the State of
Texas means that the first condition of the SAL designation is met. The five criteria of the
second condition are very generalized, occasionally ambiguous, and might apply to virtually any
archeological site. For example, the first criterion of sufficient preservation of materials to âallow
application of standard archeological techniques to advantageâ is vague as to the meaning of the
use of âtechniques to advantage.â Clearly, some kinds of surface recording techniques could be
applied to preserved chipped stone remains in a highly disturbed and shallow archeological site
for the advantage of illustrating methods in a classroom teaching exercise. Nevertheless, the
argument is put forth that without some degree of context, such sites are neither worthy of nor
warrant SAL designation simply because they contain archeological remains. A greater emphasis
is placed on the SAL criteria for sites with integrity (criterion B), addition of new information
(criterion C), and/or unique or rare attributes (criterion D), over the criterion for the preservation
sufficient to apply archeological techniques (criterion A) or the mere opportunity to test
techniques, theories, and methods (criterion E). In so doing, the SAL criteria strongly resemble
the NRHP criteria involving site integrity and potential to contain information significant to
prehistory or history.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The current investigations of the APE identified nearly 90 percent, or 81.2 acres, of the existing
and proposed ROW as being previously disturbed by grading, erosion, placement of utilities, or
private development, or with having minimal, shallow deposits of soils above bedrock. These
areas were not shovel-tested, but rather were inspected visually and through photodocumentation.
77

The remaining 10 percent, or 9.1 acres, was subjected to 36 shovel tests as well as visual
inspection. In one area where new ROW was recently proposed, but no right-of-entry was in
hand, the area immediately adjacent to it in the current ROW was shovel tested. The units
indicate that though there were intact soils, no cultural remains or deposits were likely.
Although there were eight previously recorded sites (41TV319, 41TV397, 41TV1023,
41TV1024, 41TV1027, 41TV1892, and 41TV2123, 2124) and the North Bohls Cemetery
documented in or within 100 m of the APE, there was no evidence of these sites or unmarked
graves associated with the cemetery found in the APE by this investigation even though extra
effort to do so was made. In addition, no new archeological sites or cultural materials were found
within the investigated areas. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, GMI has made a reasonable and
good faith effort to identify archeological historic properties within the APE. Shallow soil
conditions and development disturbance extant in the surveyed portions of the APE suggest that
any sites potentially present in these areas would not contain the data resources necessary to
warrant NRHP (36 CFR 60.4) or SAL (13 TAC Â§ 26.8) eligibility. Therefore, the proposed
widening of SH 71 within the 4.89-mile project area between Bee Cave and Austin will have no
adverse effect on any historic properties, and no further cultural resources investigations are
recommended for the project area.
