MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT

In keeping with tradition, TCAS had an
extremely good presence at the TAS Field
School in Menard last month. My last
count had over thirty TCAS members work- 9-13
ing during the week doing either excavation, lab work, survey, helping with children’s group at the Presidio; or excavation 9-27
at the Janee site a few miles down the
road. As always, I really enjoyed Field
School this year. The weather was excel12
lent (until the last day), the evening programs were informative, the archeology very interesting, and the
14-21
socializing with fellow TAS members as much fun as always.
Being that this event is considered a Field School I always
expect to learn something, and this year was no exception. I
learned that the difficulty of excavating a pile of medium to large
sized rocks is inversely proportional to the quantity of rocks. Also,
that the number of theories on how the rocks became arranged
the way they did is simply a factor of the number of levels dug,
multiplied by the number of units opened, squared by the number
of crew chiefs with an opinion. All kidding aside, speaking for
everyone I spoke with, we all enjoyed FS this year and we are all
already thinking about the next one. I also became aware that a
lot of TCAS members enjoy canoeing and kayaking, evidenced by
the number times we enjoyed some boat trips on the beautiful
San Saba River.

A few of us were lucky enough to have some of the Baylor June
students, who had just previously worked at the Sprague site,
9-16
work with us at TAS Field School, . Working side by side with
28-30
them and seeing their energy and enthusiasm for archeology was
July
9very refreshing and reassuring. Thanks to them, Bryan Jameson
27
and Carol Macaulay, TCAS sort of has a new focus on the significance and importance of our work and exactly what we should be
doing at the Sprague site. I’ll have more info on our future work
Oct.
there very soon.

MICKEY MILLER
Did the Late Holocene Transition to the Bow and Arrow
in North-Central Texas Increase Foraging Efficiency?
Born in Pampa TX, Mickey has had a lifelong passion for prehistoric cultures. He graduated from W. T. White high school
in Dallas, received an Associates Degree in Science from
Brookhaven College and received his B. A. in Anthropology
from the University of North Texas. He is currently working
on his thesis to complete an M.S. in Geography with a specialization in archaeology at the University of North Texas
while working as a research assistant at the University of
North Texas. Mickey is a lifelong archer and has been researching and making prehistoric style bows and arrows for
twelve years.

Most researchers agree that there was an uninterrupted transition in the
subsistence economy between the Late Archaic (3500-1250 bp.) and the
Late Prehistoric (1250-250 bp.) periods in north-central Texas. The nomadic hunter/gatherers of both periods practiced a broad-spectrum subsistence economy focused on white-tailed deer, rabbit and turtle. However, faunal data from the Upper Trinity River at Lake Lewisville and Lake
Ray Roberts indicate an increase in high-rank resources in the Late Prehistoric in terms of both costs and benefits. Essentially these people were
taking wild game more efficiently than people in the Late Archaic. This
could be due to the technological advent of the bow and arrow in the Late
Prehistoric period.

2007 TAS Field School
CONFESSIONS OF A FIRST TIME CREW CHIEF

When I was asked to act as a Crew Chief at the Janee Site during this 2007 Field School I was
startled. All I knew about “crew chiefing” was it was a sit-around-doing-paperwork-kind-of-job.
Were they just trying to get me away from digging? Were they that tired of me that they were
trying to phase me out? Figuring that my excavating days were numbered anyway, I reluctantly
agreed. I bought a couple of yellow pads and mechanical pencils and soberly turned up in
Menard.
If they were trying to get rid of me they did a really bad job. I was given a top-notch crew: Ned
Woodall (a professional archaeologist) and his wife Julia (who had surprisingly never dug before), David Goss from Dallas, and our own Gen Freix. When Ned and Julia had to leave early
they were replaced by, again our own, Royce Baker. Who could ask for a better crew?
True to Murphy’s Laws of Archaeology the only finds until Ned and Julia had to leave were by
the uninitiated Julia. When they left, their unit was taken over by Royce; immediately turning it
sterile.
As will probably be discussed much more in the future, this block of units remained mostly sterile until my last day on site when, at 65cm, it revealed an apparent new cultural level. The highlight of findings was Gen casually mentioning, “I’ve got a hearth here.”
So here’s the important stuff I learned as a crew chief (you might want to keep a copy of this for
when your turn comes up):
Always keep your trowel handy because the PI
won’t be able to find their’s
Be prepared “donate” your trowel to the PI in return
for years of telling stories about the PI and your
trowel (This also applies to tape measures, line levels, pencils, etc.)
No matter how many times you check the line level
the Total Data Station will prove you wrong

GEN’S HEARTH

If you measure your unit after the TDS (total data
station) has defined it, it will range from .9 meters to
1.2 meters on a side and will be obviously, visually
not square

Words like “unit,” “level,” “datum,” “flat” and “elevation” are defined differently by whether you
are standing in the pit or out of it
Crew Chiefing is paperwork: Learn to use “tiny,” “small,” “medium,” “large,” and “gigantic” interchangeably to describe the same object
Learn and frequently use the Prewitt “Quote of the Site”: Negative information is still information

WINDOW ON THE PAST ARCHAEOLOGY WORKSHOP
AUSTIN — Teachers, history buffs and the general public are invited to a two-day "summer camp" on Lake LBJ
July 24 and 25 to learn about archaeology as part of the Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA's) 14th annual
teacher workshop.
The workshop is designed to show educators how to use archaeology in the classroom, but people interested in
learning more about archaeology also are invited. Those attending the workshop will enjoy the surroundings at
LCRA's Nightengale Archaeological Center at Kingsland on Lake LBJ.
Among the activities planned:

•

Archaeologists and educators will make presentations about the prehistoric archaeology of Central Texas,
with an emphasis on the connections between humans and the environment.

•

Hands-on activities include:

•

using stone tools;

•

learning hunting techniques;

•

exploring archaeological field methods;

•

participating in excavations at an actual archaeological site.

Archaeology provides a unique forum for teachers, who can use the lessons to explore all sorts of subjects in
social studies, language arts, mathematics, geography and other sciences.
"For example, students interested in prehistoric American Indians can study how they adapted to the geology
and the natural processes that shaped their environment," said Andy Malof, LCRA staff archaeologist.
The cost is $35 per day. Participants are not required to attend both days, but the first day is a prerequisite for
the second.
The center is on a Colorado River site where more than 100,000 artifacts have been excavated since artifacts
were discovered there by LCRA personnel in 1988.
Educators can earn up to 12 hours from the State Board of Education Certification, the Texas Environmental
Education Advisory Committee, and the Texas Association for the Gifted and Talented.
For more information, e-mail Andy Malof or call 1-800-776-5272, Ext. 2753. or visit www.lcra.org

GROUND PENETRATING RADAR IN THE NEWS

THANKS TO TIFFANY OSBURN WE HAD A FIRST HAND GLIMPSE OF GPR AT FIELD SCHOOL THIS YEAR.
HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IS BEING USED IN THE FIELD

Archaeologists work to dig up history without using a shovel
By MIKE TONER The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Published on: 07/01/07
Cartersville — From the visitors center at Etowah Mounds
State Historic Site, the flat-topped pyramids of one of the
Southeast's premier archaeological sites loom over the landscape — as imposing today as they were five centuries ago.
At their base, the broad, grassy plain sloping toward the Etowah River gets scant attention from the 32,000 people who
visit the park each year. Mounds, after all, are what Etowah is
about.
"The focus of early archaeology was to get stuff – important,
exciting stuff," says University of South Carolina archaeologist
Adam King.
"Everyone knew they were going to find stuff in the mounds, so
that's where they dug." And spectacular "stuff" it was — showy
feathered headdresses, stone effigies, intricately carved shell
ornaments and embossed copper plates that King says demonstrate that, in its day, Etowah was a veritable "Athens of the
prehistoric South."
"The problem is that the mounds were where the important
people lived and were buried," King says. "For a place that has
been excavated on and off since 1884, we know very little
about the rest of the people who lived here."
To remedy that, he and his team or archaeologists have focused on what other experts ignored – the grassy plain where
the common people of Etowah lived and worked.
In the course of three surveys at Etowah since 2005 – the
latest concluded last month — the team has not yet turned a
shovelful of dirt or unearthed a single artifact.
But, with an assist from modern imaging technology that
"sees" beneath the soil without disturbing it, they have found
some intriguing new clues about the people who lived here
long before white men set foot on the continent.
The ancient mounds — three large earthen pyramids and three
smaller ones — were built along the Etowah River starting
around A.D. 1000. The site was inhabited for nearly 500
years.
The clay daub and other materials used in dwellings and other
buildings has different properties from the surrounding soil. A
map of the difference in the magnetic properties shows the
buried footprints of a thriving village that was dominated by
Mound A, which towers more than 60 feet above the plain.
"There is a lot out there," says King. "To the north of Mound A
and to the west, we see dense clusters of houses arranged
around little plazas. I think what we are seeing are little
neighborhoods within the larger Etowah — exactly what I would
expect in terms of a village."
King says the smaller buildings are less than 30 feet across,
but there are also a number of much larger structures.

"We see some monster buildings out there behind Mound A
and a couple between A and C. There is at least one big one
that may be 30 meters (100 feet) on a side," he says.
Estimates of Etowah's population have varied widely over the
years, but King says the density of dwellings he has encountered so far suggest that, at its peak, there may have been
1,000 people or so.
There was never much doubt that there was a village or some
sort at the foot of the massive mounds. Artist's conceptions —
including those on display at the park — all show a community
surrounded by a moat, a defensive palisade and the Etowah
River.
Hard evidence and details of the village, however, have been
more elusive. King was surprised to detect tangible traces of
the village that survived 500 years of repeated flooding of the
river plain and a century of plowing by people who farmed it
before and after the Civil War.
"It may be that periodic flooding covered the area with enough
sediment to protect the site," he says.
King estimates that it will take another year or two to completely map the entire 54-acre site, the first time that has ever
been done. Using a variety of remote sensing techniques —
ground-penetrating radar, magnetometers and electrical resistivity measurements — he hopes to develop an increasingly
detailed view of what lies underground.
In a field where discovery and digging have long been synonymous, King wants to avoid the exuberant excavation — at
times using a mule and a plow — that marked some of the
earlier archaeology investigations at Etowah.
"We see how much information we can wring out of this place
without ever putting a shovel in the ground," he says.
His cautious approach, however, stems from new cultural sensitivities as well. As the cultural descendants of the Muscogean-speaking people who once lived at Etowah, the Creek
people have claimed Etowah as a sacred site and made it
clear that they look with disfavor on any new excavation.
Despite the concerns, tribal cultural experts are working alongside the archaeologist in the efforts by King's team to use noninvasive methods — without excavation — to understand the
"crown jewel" of Southeastern prehistory.
King — and the state of Georgia, which owns the site — hope
the working alliance will pave the way for future cooperation if
excavation is needed to resolve questions that remote sensing
can't answer.
In the meantime, King plans to push the limits of new technology to "see" what, for now, he can't touch.
