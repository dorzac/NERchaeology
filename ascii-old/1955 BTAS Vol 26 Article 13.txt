RESEARCH IN EAST TEXAS PROJECTILE
POINTS
E. W.HAYNER
When the Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology
came out, a means was at hand whereby a person could go
into the field, and with a reasonable degree of success, place
different kinds of projectile points into recognized types.
With the limited amount of work that has been done in
East Texas as a guide, and four years experience by the
writer in a close study of native Indian artifacts, camp sites,
village sites, and mounds, the need for a survey of projectile
points in East Texas was clearly indicated.
When the decision to make a survey of projectile-point
types was reached, various problems arose to show that a
survey was both complicated and difficult. In order to get
a truly representative group of points, it would be necessary
to find a collection made within a given, limited area,
either by one person or by one person with the help of his
family, because different people have different ideas about
what should and should not be collected. Also, such a group
of artifacts must exclude specimens from other areas or
states, and no collection should be used which has had any
of the larger or more attractive specimens sold out of it.
Much thought and careful planning was given to the
preparation of this survey. One purpose was to see if any
particular types would prevail over East Texas. Then the
area to be covered had to be defined. It was decided to
begin the survey in Cass, Marion, Morris, Upshur, Gregg,
Harrison, and Panola counties, as they lie in about the cen.ter
of the Caddo Indian habitation area of East Texas. Also, it
was thought that if one good collection could be found in
each of these counties, which contained 100 or more projectile points, the percentages of these points could be cal-

236

culated. A suitable collection was found in each of the
counties named, except Panola and Gregg, and two were
found in Harrison County.
At the beginning of the survey, a time limit of one day
was allowed for each county. This schedule proved to be
way off in the time that was actually consumed. A whole
day can be used up just in locating a collection, only to find
that it has been sold, or that the best and most attractive
specimens have been sold, stolen, or given away. It was patience-breaking at times to find so many fine artifacts that
were completely useless for this survey. Many days, many
dollars, and many hundreds of miles were consumed, but
in all fairness, it must be said that the results were worth
the cost.
Before beginning, a trip was made to Dallas to compare
certain types with Wilson W. Crook, Jr. A few points of the
Carrollton and Elam types are found in East Texas, and
there was need to be sure that these are like those found in
the Trinity River terraces. It was seen that specimens from
East Texas and the Dallas area classified as Carrollton and
Elam are indeed of the same shape, flaking, and stem
grinding.
A trip was also made to Shreveport, Louisiana, to confer
with Dr. Clarence H. Webb about the Bulverde type of
point, and mutual agreement reached on how to identify it.
CANNON COLLECTION
The collection of A. D. Cannon of Atlanta, Texas, is from
the vicinity of Atlanta in Cass County. Mr. Cannon is a
farmer and most of his artifacts have been recovered on
the surface while plowing, or exposed by rain erosion. He
has four of the Pogo spear or lance points from a shallow

In addition, there were 14 points which could not be classified or were of unique design. The Almagre points in this
and the other collections studied might be classified as
Gary except for their crude workmanship and slight shoulders. The Paisano and Desmuke points may be of questionable identification because these types properly belong
in western and southern Texas, respectively. According to
the Handbook, the San Patrice type of East Texas and
Louisiana may sometimes be confused with Paisano, and
the Desmuke type may at times be hard to distinguish from
Abasolo, which is much more general in Texas.
The presence of 14 Williams, 21 Ellis, and 18 Edgewood
points in a collection this size is out of the ordinary. Ellis
and Edgewood are similar except that Edgewood points are
somewhat larger than Ellis, the bases are broader and concave, and they are usually made of different materials. In
every collection examined, the Ellis points stand out in
superior workmanship, as they are usually made of flint,
while other types are of cherts, quartzite, novaculite, petrified wood, etc., as well as flint. The 11 Bulverde points in
this collection are of a wide variety of materials and are
rather crude in workmanship.

An outstanding feature of this collection is the considerable use made of novaculite for Gary and Bulverde points.
Fully 90 per cent of the specimens in these two types are
made of a dark brown novaculite which must have been
brought into this area from western Arkansas or eastern
Oklahoma, as it does not occur naturally in Texas.
The point identified as Denton Nub Stemmed in this collection is the only one encountered by the writer in East
Texas.
KENNEDY COLLECTION
The collection of W. C. Kennedy of Gladewater, Texas,
was recovered from about the whole of Upshur County,
with a few specimens from Camp County. Mr. Kennedy
and his wife have collected for about 20 years, entirely
from the surface of cultivated land. This collection contains 1,123 whole projectile points and several hundred fragments. Those typed by the writer gave the following totals:

When this collection was first seen, so many points appeared to be of the Bulverde type that a trip was made to
Shreveport to consult Dr. Webb, taking several of the points
along. It was agreed that they are of the Bulverde type.
A trip was made to Jefferson, Texas, to have the lithic
materials identified by Mr. David Flesh, who is a geologist
and mineralogist. As in the Howell collection, it was found
that large numbers of points of the Gary and Bulverde types
in the Kennedy collection are made of novaculite. Thanks

are due to Mr. Flesh for making this identification under
a microscope.
As the specimens in this collection were wired to display
boards nailed to the walls of Mr. Kennedy's den, identification of types was very time-consuming. Therefore only the
most distinctive types were tabulated and the others passed
up. This collection will certainly bear closer investigation.
It should be pointed out that about 450 points in this collection are very conspicuous for their rough workmanship,
but this only adds to its interest, for it shows that Mr. Kennedy did not discard the more poorly-made objects in favor
of the best, as so many other collectors do. It is important
to note, too, that Mr. Kennedy has saved broken as well as
whole artifacts.
LOOMIS COLLECTION
The collection of R. A. Loomis of Jefferson, Texas, was
made in the vicinity of Kellyville, about six miles west of
Jefferson, in Marion County. All points were recovered
from farm land by negro farm hands, who sold or traded
them to Mr. Loomis while he was a merchant in Kellyville.
Those identified are as follows :

There were about 250 more points in this collection that
could not be definitely classified, due to poor material and
workmanship. The Clovis and Scottsbluff points would be
outstanding in any collection. The Meserve points all appear to have been rechipped from Clovis points, as the remains of previous flutings may be seen on them.
The Gary, Lange, Ellis, and Wells points are of generally
poor workmanship, but the Yarbrough examples are of excellent quality. The Bulverde are about average. The collection also contains about 30 specimens of unique shapes
and excellent pressure flaking.
LUTHER COLLECTION
The collection of Mrs. Charles Luther of Karnack, Texas,
was made in an area between Karnack and Caddo Lake in
Harrison County. It was collected from farm land by farm
hands. The types identified are:

Many more specimens in this collection are of uncertain
type. The three Carrollton points are the only ones of this
type encountered in the survey. They were taken to Dallas
for a comparison with Carrollton points recovered from terraces of the Trinity River by the Dallas Archeological Society. Mr. Wilson W. Crook, Jr., considered the points from
near Caddo Lake to be the same type as those from the
Dallas area.

LENTZ COLLECTION
This collection was made by Mr. and Mrs. J . F. Lentz of
Marshall, Texas, on their farm five miles northwest of
Marshall, in Harrison County. All specimens were recovered from the surface by Mr. and Mrs. Lentz, with the help
of farm hands. The types identified are as follows :

One feature of interest in this collection is that it contains
30 points of Pleistocene types from one farm. The Clovis,
Plainview, and Scottsbluff types are represented by five
specimens each, and the 15 Meserve points seem to have
been reworked from original Clovis and Plainview points.
Also, the Gary, Kent, and Palmillas points stand out in
that they are almost all of brown chert, and they are the
only types in this collection that are almost 100 per cent of
this material. The Palmillas points present a problem in
that their small, bulb-shaped stems grade off into stems like
those of the Kent and Gary types. There is an Archaic site
within 50 yards of the writer's camp on the shore of Caddo
Lake, also in Harrison County. This site yields flakes,
burned rock, a hammerstone, and three Palmillas points of
brown chert which would fit with ease into the Lentz group.
Of the 50 Bulverde points in this collection, four or five are

of the same material used for this type in Upshur, Camp, and
Morris counties, and perhaps they were made by the same
people that lived in that area.
The village site from which this collection was made
covers several acres. On the surface there are many potsherds belonging to the Fulton Aspect. There is a real problem in deciding which of the projectile-point types should
be associated with Caddo Indians of the Fulton Aspect and
which are Archaic. The Pleistocene types must be older
than any of the others.
CONCLUSIONS
For the man who is fortunate enough to make a survey
of this kind, there is much pleasure and it is an unforgettable experience. Most people are not able to envision, and
will not have the chance to see, the wide variety of materials from which Indian proj ectile points were made. Also,
few people realize what great variety of form and workmanship there is, or can be, within a certain type. This
variety and overlapping is readily apparent when collection;:; from different counties are inspected.
One of the original purposes of this survey was to see
what types of projectile points predominate in East Texas
counties. The tabulations above show that the Gary type is
most frequent in five of the collections studied, but outside
of that, the proportions between types vary greatly from
one collection to another.

EDITOR'S NOTE: One of the aims of the Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology was to encourage amateur archeologists
to identify types of projectile points and pottery, then tabulate
their frequencies by sites or by limited areas. Although I have
had no opportunity to see the specimens studied by Mr. Hayner,
and would probably differ from him on some of the identifications, I feel that he is to be congratulated on being the first member of this Society to make and report on a survey of this kind.
He plans to extend his studies in future articles. (ADK).
