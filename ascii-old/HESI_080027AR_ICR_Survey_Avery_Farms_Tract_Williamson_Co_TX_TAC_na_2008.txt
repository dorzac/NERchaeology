MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Waterstone Development (Waterstone) is proposing to develop the 1400.0-acre
(ac) (567.3-hectare [ha]) Avery Farms tract in central Williamson County. The proposed
development will straddle Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 1460 just south of University Boulevard in
Round Rock, Texas. Although this project is privately funded and on private property,
Waterstone contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct an
intensive cultural resources survey of the property as part of Waterstone’s due diligence
process. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources are located on
the property, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).
On 28 May through 3 June 2008, a 4-person Horizon field crew conducted an intensive
pedestrian survey of the Avery Farms tract to locate any cultural resource properties that
potentially would be impacted by the proposed development. This entailed intensive surface
inspection as well as subsurface shovel testing. To meet the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS), a minimum of 1 shovel test per 3 acres is required
on projects of this size. As such, a minimum of 467 shovel tests were required within the
1400.0-ac (567.3-ha) Avery Farms tract. Horizon excavated a total of 219 shovel tests within
the proposed development tract. The TSMASS were not met due to the dense nature of the
clayey sediments that characterize the property, which would essentially confine cultural
materials to surface contexts and allow for their discovery, if present. Additionally, a large
portion of the property (approximately 355 acres) was dominated by actively cultivated fields,
making access to these areas impractical due to the potential for damage to the growing crops.
Based on the findings within the assessed portions of the tract, as well as the dense clay nature
of the soils, it was determined that there was a low probability for finding intact buried cultural
materials within the actively plowed agricultural fields. In addition, if any prehistoric sites had
once been located within the non-surveyed areas, they have since been heavily disturbed due
to frequent and persistent plowing, which would have succeeded in significantly dispersing any
surface materials and altering the integrity of the assemblage.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the Avery Farms tract resulted in the
documentation of 3 historic-age homesteads—sites 41WM1199, 41WM1200, and 41WM1201.
No prehistoric archeological sites were identified during the survey. Based on the archeological
data alone, none of the 3 sites appear to possess any subsurface deposits that would be

deemed significant and qualify them for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D. Similarly,
none of the 3 sites appear to possess any distinctive architecture that would qualify them for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion C. Additionally, information collected from informant
interviews indicates that none of the sites were associated with a significant event or person in
history and, as such, none qualify for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A or B. With this in
mind, it is Horizon’s opinion that no further archeological work is warranted on any of the 3
newly recorded historic sites and that archeological clearance should be granted for the
undertaking. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains or burial furniture are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
property, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Waterstone Development (Waterstone) is proposing to develop the 1400.0-acre (ac)
(567.3-hectare [ha]) Avery Farms tract in central Williamson County.
The proposed
development will straddle Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 1460 just south of University Boulevard in
Round Rock, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). Although this project is privately funded and on private
property, Waterstone contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct
an intensive cultural resources survey of the property as part of Waterstone’s due diligence
process. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources are located on
the property, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the Avery Farms tract, and the production of a report suitable for review by
the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Abigail
Peyton served as Principal Investigator for the project while Michael Mudd (Horizon Project
Archeologist), Reign Clark, Jared Wiersema, and Angie Newman (Horizon field technicians)
conducted the field investigation on 28 May through 3 June 2008 to locate any cultural resource
properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed development.
The survey effort entailed intensive surface inspection as well as subsurface shovel
testing. To meet the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS), a
minimum of 1 shovel test per 3 acres is required on projects of this size. As such, a minimum of
467 shovel tests were required within the 1400.0-ac (567.3-ha) Avery Farms tract. Horizon
excavated a total of 219 shovel tests within the proposed development tract. The TSMASS
were not met due to the dense nature of the clayey sediments that characterize the property,
which would essentially confine cultural materials to surface contexts and allow for their
discovery, if present. Additionally, a large portion of the property (approximately 355 acres) was
dominated by actively cultivated fields, making access to these areas impractical due to the
potential for damage to the growing crops. Based on the findings within the assessed portions
of the tract, as well as the dense clay nature of the soils, it was determined that there was a low
probability for finding intact buried cultural materials within the actively plowed agricultural fields.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

In addition, if any prehistoric sites had once been located within the non-surveyed areas,
theyhave since been heavily disturbed due to frequent and persistent plowing, which would
have succeeded in significantly dispersing any surface materials and altering the integrity of the
assemblage.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the Avery Farms tract resulted in the
documentation of 3 historic-age homesteads—sites 41WM1199, 41WM1200, and 41WM1201.
No prehistoric archeological sites were identified during the survey.
Site 41WM1199 consists of 1 primary residence with an adjacent cistern and 2 barns
located in the eastern half of the Avery Farms tract north of County Road (CR) 112 and east of
CR 1460. Although uninhabited, the property is currently being used as a staging area for hay
processed from the surrounding fields as well as a junk repository. The primary residence has
undergone significant modern modifications including asphalt roof shingles, modern siding, and
electrical wiring. The barn structures also exhibit modifications ranging from reinforced metal
siding to chain-linked fencing and metal gates. In general, the house and 1 of the barn
structures are in moderate shape. However, the same cannot be said for the 2-story barn, as it
is in very poor condition and may even be considered of moderate risk of collapse. Modern
agricultural equipment was observed in and around this barn, indicating that a fair amount of
activity still takes place within the area, but not within the confines of the dilapidated barn. No
artifacts with maker’s marks or temporally diagnostic characteristics were observed within the
confines of this site. However, as the buildings on site 41WM1199 are constructed with
dimensional lumber, round nails, and corrugated metal, it is likely that the site was utilized
during the 20th century.
Site 41WM1200 is a historic-age farmstead consisting of 1 primary residence, 2 barns, 2
sheds, 2 garages, 1 cistern, and 1 windmill. It is located southwest of the intersection of CRs
1460 and 112 and is accessible from both roadways. Although uninhabited, the site is currently
being used to access the neighboring corn fields via its 2-track driveway. The primary
residence has undergone modern modifications including modern siding, an electrical pole, and
significant gutting of its interior. Other modern additions include reinforced metal siding on the
barn and shed structures and concrete slab foundations in 1 of the garages and both sheds. No
artifacts with maker’s marks or temporally diagnostic characteristics were observed within the
confines of this site. However, as the buildings on site 41WM1200 are constructed with
dimensional lumber, round nails, and corrugated metal, it is likely that the site was utilized
during the 20th century.
Site 41WM1201 is a historic-age farmstead consisting of 1 primary residence, 2 sheds, a
partially destroyed stone structure, the remains of a collapsed structure, and a concrete
foundation slab located near the western boundary of the Avery Farms tract. All of the
structures, including the primary residence, have experienced considerable damage due
predominantly to neglect coupled with the natural encroachment of native vegetation. The
residential structure has undergone modern modification as is evidenced by the presence of
corrugated metal roofing and electrical wiring. As the buildings on site 41WM1201 are
constructed with dimensional lumber, round nails, and corrugated metal, it is likely that the site
was utilized during the 20th century.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The 1400.0-ac (567.3-ha) Avery Farms tract straddles FM 1460 just south of University
Boulevard in Round Rock, Texas (see Figures 1 and 2). It can be found on the US Geological
Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Round Rock, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). The
tract consists of predominantly cleared agricultural lands located within an area that is
experiencing rapid residential and commercial development. Presently, much of the proposed
development tract is dominated by cultivated fields underlain by extremely dense clayey
sediments. The remainder of the tract is made up of open grassland and improved pastures
with thin corridors of riparian vegetation traversing the property. In these areas, pockets of
caliche bedrock were observed interspersed with dense clayey deposits.
Overview
photographs of the Avery Farms tract are presented in Figures 3 through 8.

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Avery Farms tract lies on the border of 2 physiographic regions: the Blackland
Prairie and the Edwards Plateau. The Blackland Prairie is situated between the Edwards
Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east. This region is characterized by poor
drainage and gently rolling surfaces. The Edwards Plateau is bound to the east and the south
by the Balcones Escarpment, which forms a curved band of major faults. Characterized by
Cretaceous limestones, the Edwards Plateau contains sinkholes and caverns formed by
permanently flowing water.
Hydrologically, the Avery Farms tract is in the Colorado River watershed, with surface
water flowing from west to east over most of the area, typically by overland sheet flow toward
McNutt Creek.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The geological formation underlying the Avery Farms tract is a thick sequence of
Cretaceous-age, sedimentary rock strata. Specifically, the area is underlain by the Upper
Cretaceous-age Austin Chalk (Barnes 1974). The Avery Farms tract is situated on the AustinHouston Black-Castephen soil association, which is characterized by calcareous clayey soils
formed in marine chalk, marl, shale, and clays found on uplands. Table 1 lists the types of soils
found on the Avery Farms Tract.

CLIMATE

The modern climate in Williamson County is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot
summers and short, mild winters. The climate is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air
masses predominant throughout spring, summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are

HJN 080027 AR

11

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

dominant in winter and provide a continental climate characterized by considerable variations in
temperature. Rainfall occurs throughout the year, with slightly more precipitation falling during
spring. In winter, the average temperature is 49 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) (9° Celsius [C]), and
the average daily minimum is 38°F (3°C). In summer, the average temperature is 83°F (28°C),
and the average daily maximum is 95°F (35°C).
Pollen and faunal evidence provides the most reliable information for climatic change
from the Pleistocene to the present (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant and
Holloway (1985) have summarized recent paleoenvironmental analyses and have provided a
sequential order for climatic periods in central Texas: Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to
14,000 BP); Late Glacial period (14,000 to 10,000 BP); and Post-Glacial period (10,000 BP to
present). Pollen samples from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period indicated that the central Texas
climate was cooler and wetter than at present and that the region was densely forested (Bryant
and Holloway 1985). Slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying trend
characterized the Late Glacial period (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). In central
Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas
as the central Texas environment appears to have stabilized. The deciduous forests had long
since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming trend that
began the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there appears to
have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 BP
Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in
central Texas were probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Avery Farms tract is situated on the border of 2 biotic provinces: the Texan and the
Balconian (Blair 1950). The Balconian biotic province is characterized by grasslands, while the
Texan biotic province is characterized as an intermediate zone between the forests of the
Austroriparian zone to the east and the grasslands of the Balconian zone to the west.
Vegetation west of the Balcones fault consists of tall and mid-sized grasses, post and live oak,
mesquite, and junipers. The eastern part of Williamson County, which has been extensively
utilized for agricultural purposes, is still wooded along its streams with mesquite, oak, pecan,
and elm trees.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird.
Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat
snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake,
copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and

antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are
no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; and Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400
BP. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 BP)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers two-thirds of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995),
is divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late
(3000 to 1200 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a
similar transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators
being the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a
gradual decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying
trends first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these
climatic changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was
already the case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and

earth ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game
continued. Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller
areas than did the Paleo-Indian groups.

3.3

EARLY ARCHAIC (8000 TO 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
Paleo-Indian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyonlands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late Paleo-Indian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).

3.4

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (5000 TO 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different

16

080027_arch_survey_report.docx

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 1400-Acre Avery Farms Tract, Williamson County, Texas

subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.

3.5

LATE ARCHAIC (3000 TO 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at 41WM815 and dated between 2800
to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock middens on
the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in any other
period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a result of
the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes such as

HJN 080027 AR

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

sotol and yucca—foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens) in order
to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely resulted in
the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of buffalo.
Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an increase
in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.6

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

3.7

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 400 BP TO PRESENT)

The Historic period, which began with the arrival of Europeans into the region, can be
divided into 3 subperiods: early, middle, and late. Only a brief overview of the period is given
here. For a more detailed essay, see Newcomb 1993:1-63.
The first documented arrival of Europeans into Central Texas dates to the early 18th
century (Newcomb 1993). Their influence, however, preceded their arrival. In the late 17th
century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began migrating into Central Texas
to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines, missions, and on Spanish
ranches. At approximately the same time, horses stolen from the Spanish had become an
integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison hunters of the High
Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They terrorized native
groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to flee, some into
Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the region encountered native
groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the Apache, and the
diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. Their accounts, therefore, do
not provide direct analogs to prehistoric lifeway patterns, but rather represent a time of drastic
cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns may have prevailed through
time. Along with large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic
affiliations, small band-sized residential camps, both dating to this particular period, are found in
Central Texas (Collins 1995:386). These latter sites may represent indigenous groups.
The middle Historic subperiod began about 1730 and ended about 1800 as the mission
system was failing (Hester 1989; Collins 1995:386). Historic documents of this period make
reference to remnants of native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins
1995). Toward the end of this subperiod, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern
Texas from the high plains. Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be
highly biased since they are provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers
(Collins 1995).
The late Historic subperiod is composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung
nomadic native groups (primarily the Comanche),” and an archeological record of the European
presence (Collins 1995:387). The Comanche presence began fading in the mid- to late 19th
century. Their final demise heralded the end of Native American presence in Central Texas.
EuroAmerican settlement commenced during the Texas Revolution. Williamson County
was then a part of Milam County. Dr. Thomas Kenney established the first civilian settlement,
Kenney’s Fort, in 1838. Williamson County was established on 13 March 1848, with
Georgetown as the county seat (Odintz 2008).
According to the Handbook of Texas Online (Odintz 2008):
According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a population of 1,379 whites
and 155 slaves, living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel.
As was common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage was used to
grow corn. Three families owned fifteen or more slaves in 1850, but family farms and

HJN 080027 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

subsistence agriculture remained the norm prior to the Civil War. While most of the
settlers had moved to Texas from other southern states, particularly Tennessee, a
substantial contingent came from Vermilion County in Illinois, and this latter group
remained pro-Union and Republican in its political orientation during the secession crisis.
On the eve of the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage and
was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied and
reflected the county's geographical diversity. Farmers were using the rich blackland soils
in the eastern half of the county to grow wheat and corn. Cotton was introduced in the
1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in 1860, and it was not an important cash crop for
most farmers. The early settlers had found large herds of wild cattle in the 1840s, and
cattle ranching, both for home consumption and for market, was widespread throughout
the county by 1860. The number of cattle on county ranches had more than tripled from
11,973 head in 1850 to 38,114 head in 1860. Similarly, the number of sheep grew from
2,937 producing 3,499 pounds of wool in 1850 to 16,952 sheep and 32,994 pounds of
wool in 1860. Williamson County was marked by political divisions during the secession
crisis, divisions that were carried over into the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist
sentiment was strong in the county, and a resolution denouncing secession was adopted
by a Texas Constitutional Union party meeting in Round Rock in 1860.
Though the Civil War had caused little material damage in the area, the county was a
much poorer place in 1870 than it had been in 1860. Various feeder routes to the
Chisholm Trail passed through Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed
through or originated in the county from the 1860s through the early 1880s. With the
coming of the railroads to the county in the 1870s, Taylor, in the eastern part of the
county, became an important rail center for the cattle trade. Cattle raising, after declining
somewhat in importance in the early twentieth century, was again a major part of the
agricultural economy by 1950, and in 1969 ranchers owned a record 65,093 cattle.
Sheep and goat raising followed a similar pattern. … Cotton, the second boom industry in
Williamson County, also developed about the same time as the cattle industry.
Both the cattle and the cotton booms were aided by the improved communications
available in the county in the later nineteenth century. The International-Great Northern
Railroad, which later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific, was built across the
eastern part of the county in 1876 and led to the founding of Taylor (now Williamson
County's third largest city) and Hutto and to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened
up large areas in eastern Williamson County to commercial farming. The Taylor, Bastrop
and Houston Railway, which was eventually consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas Railway, was built in the 1880s and aided in the development of Taylor, Granger,
and Bartlett. Roads were generally poor throughout the county in the early twentieth
century.

The Spanish and other Europeans arrived and moved into the area, pushing the Native
Americans west. Western government and policies gave rise to the creation of Williamson
County and the start of an agriculturally independent county. When the Civil War began, county
opinions were as divided as the rest of the country. After the war and during reconstruction, the
county’s economy was devastated. Ultimately, the county turned toward agriculture endeavors
to recover from this depression. Commercial agriculture was the predominant economic focus

throughout the 20th century. Today, the county’s population is booming as the Austin
metropolitan area continues to expand northward.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas web site indicated a minimum of 11 previously recorded archeological sites within a 1.0km (0.6-mile) radius of the Avery Farms Tract (THC 2008). These 11 sites include the Union
Hill Cemetery (41WM508), 1 historic farmstead (41WM986), 1 historic dam (41WM1127), 1
prehistoric lithic procurement area (41WM671), 2 prehistoric lithic scatters (41WM1127 and
41WM1158), 1 multi-component site consisting of a prehistoric lithic scatter and a historic
scatter (41WM680), 1 prehistoric open camp (41WM538), 1 prehistoric open camp with an
associated burned rock midden feature (41WM29), and 2 multi-component sites consisting of
prehistoric open camps and historic farmsteads (41WM672 and 41WM673). Currently, no
sites, including any listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designated as
SALs, occur within the boundaries of the 1400-acre tract. However, 3 of the sites (41WM672,
41WM673, and 41WM986) are located just west of the property boundaries. According to the
Atlas, 2 formal linear cultural resources surveys have been conducted across the property. One
appears to have been conducted for the right-of-way of FM 1460 in 2006, while the other
appears to have been conducted along 2 water courses (presumably in support of a US Army
Corps of Engineers [USACE] permit) in 2004. Both of these linear surveys produced negative
results within the boundaries of the Avery Farms tract. Together, they appear to have covered
less than 5% of the total area of the property.

4.2

HISTORIC MAP RESEARCH

As the majority of the Avery Farms tract has never been previously surveyed for cultural
resources, the 1941 aerial photograph of the Avery Farms property was also reviewed in order
to determine if any evidence of historic structures and/or complexes were visible within the
property boundary. Careful inspection of the 1941 aerial photograph revealed that 3 separate
complexes are located within the Avery Farms tract (Figure 9).

INFORMANT INTERVIEWS

On 20 June 2008, Principal Investigator Abigail Peyton conducted an informant interview
with Mr. Charles Avery, whose family owned the Avery Farms tract prior to its acquisition by
Waterstone. Mr. Avery indicated that the property had been in the Avery family for the past 150
years. He indicated that the various abandoned homesteads on the property were occupied by
tenant farmers who cultivated predominately cotton in the adjacent open fields. Many of these
cotton farmers were known to be Swedish immigrants who moved into the area in the middle
19th century and established homesteads throughout much of Williamson County. According to
Mr. Avery, the homestead located in the central portion of the Avery Farms tract (site
41WM1200) was occupied by Jones and Ruth Wallin and their 6 children. Although Mr. Avery
was unsure when the homestead was actually constructed, he did mention that the 3rd child,
Mr. Rudolf Wallin, was born in the Wallin house in the early 1900s. When asked about the 2
remaining homesteads on the property (41WM1199 and 41WM1201), Mr. Avery did not know
the names of the tenant farmers who occupied them. He did mention, however, that after the
original occupants abandoned the homesteads, the structures were often used to house

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A 4-person Horizon field crew conducted the intensive pedestrian survey of the 1400.0ac (567.3-ha) Avery Farms tract on 28 May through 3 June 2008. This survey included
intensive surface inspection as well as subsurface shovel testing. Due to the large size of the
development tract, the area was subdivided into 6 parcels (parcels A though H) in order to
facilitate easier documentation. To meet the TSMASS, a minimum of 1 shovel test per 3 acres
is required for projects of this size. As such, a minimum of 467 shovel tests were required
within the 1400.0-ac (567.3-ha) Avery Farms tract. Horizon excavated a total of 219 shovel
tests within the development tract. The TSMASS were not met due to the dense nature of the
clayey sediments that characterize the property, which would essentially confine cultural
materials to surface contexts and allow for their discovery, if present. Additionally, a large
portion of the property (approximately 355 acres) was dominated by actively cultivated fields,
making access to these areas impractical due to the potential for damage to the growing crops.
Based on the findings within the assessed portions of the tract, as well as the dense clay nature
of the soils, it was determined that there was a low probably for finding intact buried cultural
materials within the actively plowed agricultural fields.
All excavated matrices were screened through 6-millimeter (mm) (1/4-inch) hardware
mesh and examined for cultural materials. In general, the Avery Farms tract is dominated by
agricultural land, much of which was cultivated during the time of the survey effort. Soils
throughout the Avery Farms tract were dense clay characteristic of the Blackland Prairie with
little to no alluvial deposition noted along the banks of the streams that traverse the property.
The field crew set out to employ a non-collection policy for non-diagnostic cultural
materials, including lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap. Such materials
were to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced where they
were found. In the event that diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, etc.)
were encountered, they were to be collected and placed in resealable plastic bags labeled with
relevant provenience information. Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils,
landforms, cultural materials observed, etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
each excavated shovel test, and photographs with a photo log were completed when
appropriate. Shovel test location data were acquired via a handheld Global Positioning System
(GPS) unit using the Universal Transverse Mercatur (UTM) coordinate system and map datum
North American Datum (NAD) 27. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 10, and shovel
test data are provided in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

The intensive cultural resources survey of the Avery Farms Tract resulted in the
documentation of 3 new historic-age sites: 41WM1199, 41WM1200, and 41WM1201. All 3
sites consist of complexes of early to mid-20th century structures with little to no evidence of
subsurface deposition. All 3 sites have experienced modern renovations, indicating that these
areas were occupied well into modern times. The location of these newly recorded sites is
presented in Figure 11.

6.1

SITE 41WM1199

6.1.1

General Description

Site 41WM1199 is a historic farmstead that resides on an upland hilltop in Parcel H of
the Avery Farms tract (see Figure 11). The area in which the site is located is dominated by
large hackberry trees and tall Johnson grasses around the primary residence, while open
coastal hay fields make up the remainder of the site. The nearest natural waterway, McNutt
Creek, is located approximately 800.0 meters (m) (2624.7 feet [ft]) east of the site. Soils were
found to consist of gravelly silty clays with limestone bedrock frequently observed eroding out
from the ground surface. In general, the hilltop has been eroded down to a fractured bedrock
stratum and has been heavily impacted by years of sheet erosion as well as agriculturally based
improvements. Due to moderately high grasses, surface visibility was poor (ca. 10 to 20%)
throughout much of the site.
The complex of structures that make up site 41WM1199 was identified prior to the field
effort after careful examination of the 1941 aerial photography of the property. The structures
encountered during the field effort include a primary residence, 1 totally collapsed structure, 2
barns, 1 animal pen, a cistern, and a capped well. Most of the structures have undergone either
modern renovations or have suffered significant damage due to neglect and weathering. A
sketch map of site 41WM1199 is presented in Figure 12.

6.1.2

Observed Cultural Materials

Observed cultural materials were generally sparse, consisting only of a light scattering of
clear glass shards, indeterminate metal scraps, and round nails seen on the surface in areas
near the primary residence and collapsed structure. Machine-cut square nails were invented in
1790 and continued to be widely used until the 1850s, when wire or round nails were invented
and became more popular (Fontana and Greenleaf 1962). While machine-cut square nails

HJN 080027 AR

31

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigation

were generally still in use, wire nails began to outnumber machine-cut square nails by the
1890s. As a general rule, sites with a higher percentage of machine-cut square nails can be
considered older in age than those that are dominated by wire nails (Fontana and Greenleaf
1962). The existence of exclusively round nails on site 41WM1199 indicates that the primary
structure was built no earlier than the early 20th century. However, as none of the artifacts were
found to have maker’s marks or temporally diagnostic characteristics, it is difficult to anchor a
more specific date of occupation.
6.1.3

Cultural Features

As previously mentioned, a 1941 aerial photograph of the Avery Farms tract shows a
complex of structures located within the tract just north of CR 112 and east of CR 1460. The
primary residence is located in the southwest corner of the site and consists of a small singlefamily home complete with a foundation constructed of hand-cut limestone blocks, electricity,
and a limestone and mortar cistern. The residence was found to exhibit a number of modern
improvements in the form of asphalt roof shingles, modern siding, a screened-in porch, and an
electrical pole. Overview photographs of site 41WM1199 are presented in Figures 13 to 16.
A total of 2 wooden barns are located in the northern portion of the site. The barn
nearest the residence is the smaller of the 2 and has been reinforced during modern times with
corrugated metal siding. Additional modifications to the structure include chain-link fencing and
metal gates around an adjacent animal pen. While the barn’s original hand-cut limestone block
foundation remains intact, the overall integrity of the structure can be considered poor, as it is
rather dilapidated and lacks most of the original wooden infrastructure.
The larger of the 2 barns lies along the northeastern boundary of site 41WM1199. It
consists of a partially collapsed metal roof and cedar siding material that appears to have been
once painted red. Unlike the remaining structures, which utilized limestone in their foundations,
this barn was constructed directly on the ground surface. This was done most likely to allow for
easy maneuvering of livestock in and around the base of the structure. Although the barn is still
standing, its overall condition can be classified as poor judging by its slouching roof and rotting
side-boards. It, too, exhibits modern improvements, including an adjacent animal pen to the
south constructed of metal fencing. Modern features such as a metal water silo, telephone
poles, and farming equipment were found to be scattered about the open areas separating the 2
barns.
6.1.4

Horizontal and Vertical Extent

Based on the distribution of the structures present as well as surface artifacts, the
horizontal extent of site 41WM1199 measures approximately 80.0 m (262.5 ft) north/south by

shallow depths ranging from 5.0 to 10.0 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) (2.0 to 3.9 inches

Summary

Site 41WM1199 is a historic-age farmstead consisting of 1 primary residence with an
adjacent cistern and 2 barns located in the eastern half of the Avery Farms tract north of CR112
and east of CR 1460. Although uninhabited, the property is currently being used as a staging
area for hay processed from the surrounding fields as well as a junk repository. The primary
residence has undergone significant modern modifications including asphalt roof shingles,
modern siding, and electrical poles. The barn structures also contain modifications ranging from
reinforced metal siding to chain-linked fencing and metal gates. In general, the house and 1 of
the barn structures are in moderate shape; however, the same cannot be said for the 2-story
barn, as it is in very poor condition and may even be considered at moderate risk of collapse.
Modern agricultural equipment was observed around this barn, indicating that a fair amount of
activity still takes place within the area but not within the confines of the dilapidated structure.
While the recovered artifacts (i.e., round nails and clear glass) suggest a historic-age
presence on the site, they do little to specify the date of occupation, as none were found to
possess maker’s marks or temporally diagnostic characteristics. Similarly, historic map
research fails to anchor the date of occupation and only indicates that the structures were
present on the site when the 1941 aerial photograph was taken. However, as buildings on site
41WM1199 are constructed with dimensional lumber, round nails, and corrugated metal, it is
likely that the site was utilized during the 20th century.
Presently, there is very little definitive information that can be extracted from the cultural
materials and features observed on site 41TV1199. While the 1941 aerial photograph indicates
that the structures are at least 50 years old, it is difficult to extract a more accurate date of
occupation for the site. The site was found to lack any unaltered structural remains or putatively
diagnostic artifacts, and has been considerably impacted by the modern renovations, clearing
and bulldozing of trash. In general, site 41WM1199 consists of complex of structures commonly
encountered in rural farming communities. Informant interviews confirm that the occupants of
site 41WM1199 were small-time tenant farmers who were not associated with any events or
persons important in local history. As such, it would appear that site 41WM1199 has little, if
any, research value. Locational data have been recorded as a result of survey activities and the
site's boundaries have been fully delineated, but there would seem to be no additional research
potential to this small historic site. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41WM1199 is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further archeological investigations are
warranted.

SITE 41WM1200

6.2.1

General Description

Site 41WM1200 is a historic farmstead located on a hill that slopes moderately to the
west toward an unnamed tributary of Chandler Branch in Parcel D (see Figure 11). The
structures encountered during the field effort include a primary residence, 2 barns, 2 garages, 1
animal pen, 1 cistern, and 1 windmill. This unnamed tributary is adjacent to the site and forms
the western boundary of the site while expansive corn and hay fields form the form the eastern
and southern boundaries of the site. Presently, the area in which the site is located is
considerably overgrown, dominated by stands of large hackberry trees and tall Johnson
grasses. As a result, surface visibility was consistently poor (ca. 30 to 40%), except in those
areas were 2-track roads offered an open corridor. Soils were found to consist of dense
gravelly clays with little to no alluvial deposition found adjacent to the nearby stream. In
general, the hilltop has been eroded down to a gravelly substratum due to years of agriculturalbased improvements, clearing, and erosion. The residence, barn, and garage structures appear
to be in relatively good condition, indicating the farmstead has not been abandoned for very
long. A sketch map and overview photographs of site 41WM1200 are presented in Figures 17
to 23.
Inspection of the 1941 aerial photograph of the Avery Farms tract (see Figure 9) shows
a large cleared area occupied by a complex of structures, the details of which remain vague due
to the poor quality of the photograph. What is clear, however, is the prominent nature of this
particular homestead in comparison to the other such residential areas nearby. Informant
interviews indicated that this homestead was occupied by the Wallin Family during the early to
middle 20th century.
6.2.2

Observed Cultural Materials

Observed cultural materials were generally sparse, consisting only of a light scattering of
indeterminate metal scraps and round nails amidst a slew of modern debris observed
throughout the site. None of the artifacts were found to exhibit maker’s marks or temporally
diagnostic characteristics.
6.2.3

Cultural Features

Site 41WM1200 consists of a primary residence, 2 barns, 2 sheds, 2 garages, 1 animal
pen, and 1 cistern. The house was constructed on a concrete slab foundation with corrugated
metal roofing, a portable (window) air conditioning unit, shingle siding, and electric wiring. Both
of the barns have been thoroughly reinforced with corrugated metal siding and appear to have
served as storage facilities for hay or livestock feed. The sheds contain remnants of tools and
miscellaneous machine parts, while the garages seemed to have housed machinery and other
associated farming implements. A completely collapsed structure was observed near the
primary residence. It, too, was built on a concrete slab, but due to its collapsed state, its
function is unclear. However, its placement near the residence may indicate its use as a

storage shed. The cistern is located in the northwest corner of the site and exhibits modern
reinforcements in the form of metal wrapped around its exterior. The presence of a moving
truck and a nearby modern trash dump located near the windmill indicates that this area has
been utilized, albeit likely as a junk repository, up until recently. All in all, the layout of the
farmstead suggests that this area was once the locale of a substantial farming operation where
the occupants required the usage of a number of structures, each of which served a specific
purposed in the overall function of the agricultural enterprise. Presently, the farmstead is
abandoned and is used by the current landowners as an access point to the surrounding corn
fields.
6.2.4

Horizontal and Vertical Extent

Based on the distribution of the structures and surface artifacts, the horizontal extent of
site 41WM1200 measures approximately 120.0 m (393.7 ft) north/south by 60.0 m (196.9 ft)
east/west. The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41TV1200 resides
is entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the soils are rocky clays underlain by near-surface
bedrock. Of the 8 shovel tests excavated on the site, none were found to contain cultural
materials and, in fact, all of the shovel tests were terminated at very shallow depths ranging
from 5.0 to 10.0 cmbs (2.0 to 3.9 inbs).
6.2.5

Summary

Site 41WM1200 is a historic-age farmstead consisting of 1 primary residence, 2 barns, 2
sheds, 2 garages, 1 cistern, and 1 windmill. It is located southwest of the intersection of CRs
1460 and 112 and is accessible from both roadways. Although uninhabited, the site is currently
being used as access to the neighboring corn fields via its 2-track driveway. The primary
residence has undergone modern modifications including modern siding, an electrical pole, and
significant gutting of its interior. Other modern additions include reinforced metal siding on the
barn and shed structures, a concrete slab in 1 of the garages and in both sheds. A fair amount
of cedar siding has been stripped from the outbuildings by looters who tend to steal weathered
building materials for their aesthetic appeal.
While the observed artifacts (i.e., round nails and structural debris) suggest a historicage presence on the site, they do little to specify the date of occupation, as none were found to
possess maker’s marks or temporally diagnostic characteristics. Similarly, historic map
research fails to anchor the date of occupation and only indicates that the structures were
present on the site when the 1941 aerial photograph was taken. As buildings on site
41WM1200 are constructed with dimensional lumber, round nails, and corrugated metal, it is
likely that the site was utilized during the 20th century.
Presently, there is very little definitive information that can be extracted from the cultural
materials and features observed on site 41TV1200. The site was found to lack any unaltered
structural remains or putatively diagnostic artifacts, and has been considerably impacted by the
modern renovations. While the 1941 aerial photograph indicates that the structures are at least
50 years old, it is difficult to extract a more accurate date of occupation for the site based on the

archeology alone. Informant interviews indicate that the homestead was occupied by the Wallin
Family as early as the early 1900s. The Wallins were small-time farmers, the descendants of
which still reside in Williamson County. In general, site 41WM1200 consists of complex of
structures commonly encountered in rural farming communities. Informant interviews confirm
that the occupants of site 41WM1200 were small-time tenant farmers who were not associated
with any events or persons important in local history. As such, it would appear that site
41WM1200 has little, if any, research value. Locational data have been recorded as a result of
survey activities and the site's boundaries have been fully delineated, but there would seem to
be no additional research potential to this small historic site. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that
site 41WM1200 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further archeological
investigations are warranted.

6.3

SITE 41WM1201

6.3.1

General Description

Site 41WM1201 is a historic farmstead that is located on an upland hilltop in Parcel C of
the Avery Farms tract and consists of a primary residential structure, 2 totally collapsed
structures, 2 wooden sheds, and 1 partially collapsed structure made of stone (see Figure 11).
The area in which the site is located is considerably overgrown with large hackberry trees,
mesquite trees, prickly pear cactus, and tall Johnson grass present throughout. Several of the
structures appear to have hackberry trees growing directly adjacent to exterior walls, imposing
on the structural integrity of the buildings themselves. The nearest natural waterway, a tributary
of Chandler Branch, is located approximately 500.0 m (1640.4 ft) east of the site. As the hilltop
on which the site is located has experienced considerable erosion as a result of agricultural
practices and physical weathering, soils were found to consist of dense calcareous clays. Due
to moderately high grasses, surface visibility was generally poor (ca. 10 to 20%) except in those
areas where a 2-track road provided an open corridor. A sketch map and overview photographs
of site 41WM1201 are presented in Figures 24 to 31.
6.3.2

Observed Cultural Materials

Observed cultural materials were very sparse, consisting only of a light scattering
indeterminate metal scraps, and round nails seen only in and around areas where structures
and pilings of collapsed structures were present. The existence of exclusively round nails on
site 41WM1201 indicates that the primary structure was built no earlier than the early 20th
century (Fontana and Greenleaf 1962). None of the artifacts were found to have maker’s marks
or temporally diagnostic characteristics.
6.3.3

Cultural Features

Inspection of the 1941 aerial photograph of the Avery Farms tract shows structures
present within the Avery Farms Tract down an east-west running 2-track road. This road turns
to the north at the farmstead, dividing the site in half. On the eastern side resides the primary

residence and modern metal cistern. The residence is equipped with a corrugated metal roof
and cedar siding and was constructed using round nails. Additionally, it is equipped with
electrical wiring and indoor plumbing. Although the house is still standing, its overall condition
can be classified as poor judging by its slouching roof and rotting side-boards. Amidst the tall
Johnson grass and dense hackberry trees surrounding the house, metal and glass automobile
parts along with miscellaneous modern trash were observed scattered across the surface.
The western section of the site consists of a complex of structures both partially standing
and completely collapsed. Of the 3 standing structures in this area, 2 are small sheds
constructed using round nails, cedar siding, and corrugated metal roofing. The sheds are in
moderate condition with the majority of the walls and roofing intact. It is evident, however, that
these sheds have experienced considerable decay and are likely no longer structurally sound
judging by the warped nature of the cedar siding. The third standing structure is located in the
southwest corner of the site and is constructed of cut limestone blocks. Very little of this
structure remains standing with only a front façade and portions of the side walls still intact. The
roof has completely collapsed and the wooden lentils that made up the door and window frames
have either been removed or have disintegrated. Presently, the stone structure has been nearly
completely overtaken by vegetation, with large trees lining the perimeter of the structure and
waist-high Johnson grass carpeting the interior of the structure. A concrete animal trough was
also noted in close proximity the stone structure.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 1400-Acre Avery Farms Tract, Williamson County, Texas

The remaining features in the western portion of site 41WM1201 consist of a concrete
slab and an unidentifiable collapsed structure represented by a pile of debris intermixed with
modern trash, concrete blocks, and corrugated metal scraps. These features were also
considerably overgrown and appear to be more recent additions to the farmstead judging by the
presence of concrete blocks imbedded with load-bearing cedar posts and a level concrete
foundation slab.
6.3.4

Horizontal and Vertical Extent

Based on the location of the structures and the distribution of surface artifacts, the
horizontal extent of site 41WM1201 measures approximately 150.0 m (492.1 ft) north/south by
100.0 m (328.1 ft) east/west. The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site
41TV1201 resides is entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the soils consisted of dense
homogenous clays. Of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site, none were found to contain
cultural materials, and, in fact, all of the shovel tests were terminated at very shallow depths
ranging from 10.0 to 20.0 cmbs (4.0 to 8.0 inbs).
6.3.5

Summary

Site 41WM1201 is a historic-age farmstead consisting of 1 primary residence, 2 sheds, a
partially destroyed stone structure, the remains of a collapsed structure, and a concrete
foundation slab located near the western boundary of the Avery Farms Tract. All of the
structures, including the primary residence, have experienced considerable damage due
predominantly to neglect coupled with the natural encroachment of native vegetation. The
residential structure has undergone modern modification as is evidenced by the presence of
corrugated metal roofing and electrical wiring. While it is clear that the farmstead was
abandoned some time ago, the total lack of any domestic artifacts such as ceramic or glass
debris in or around the residential structure is somewhat puzzling, as such structures are
typically accompanied by a scattering of ubiquitous historic-age artifacts. It is possible that the
dense vegetation obscured the ground surface, thus accounting for the extremely low incidence
of artifacts associated with the structure. However, as the structures were constructed using
dimensional lumber, round nails, and corrugated metal, it is likely that the site was utilized
during the 20th century.
Presently, there is very little definitive information that can be extracted from the cultural
materials and features observed on site 41TV1201. The site was found to lack any unaltered
structural remains or putatively diagnostic artifacts, and has been considerably impacted by the
modern renovations. While the 1941 aerial photograph indicates that the structures are at least
50 years old, it is difficult to extract a more accurate date of occupation for the site based on the
archeology alone. In general, site 41WM1201 consists of complex of structures commonly
encountered in rural farming communities. Informant interviews confirm that the occupants of
site 41WM1201 were small-time tenant farmers who were not associated with any events or
persons important in local history. As such, it would appear that site 41WM1201 has little, if
any, research value. Locational data have been recorded as a result of survey activities and the
site's boundaries have been fully delineated, but there would seem to be no additional research

potential to this small historic site. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41WM1201 is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further archeological investigations are
warranted.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

Waterstone is proposing to develop the 1400.0-acre (ac) (567.3-hectare [ha]) Avery
Farms tract in central Williamson County. The proposed development will straddle FM 1460 just
south of University Boulevard in Round Rock, Texas. Although this project is privately funded
and on private property, Waterstone contracted with Horizon to conduct an intensive cultural
resources survey of the property as part of Waterstone’s due diligence process. The purpose of
the survey was to determine if any cultural resources are located on the property, and, if so, to
determine their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.
The survey resulted in the documentation of 3 historic farmsteads on the property (sites
41WM1199, 41WM1200, and 41WM1201). Generally speaking, all 3 of the newly documented
sites are early to middle 20th century farmsteads indicative of rural farming/ranching activities in
this portion of Williamson County. The sites are fairly uniform, consisting of simple compounds
made up of a central residential structure surrounded by ancillary structures such as barns and
sheds. The structures themselves are in moderate to poor condition and most have been
modified in modern times as is evidenced by the presence of corrugated metal or asbestos
siding, electrical wiring, or concrete reinforcements. No artifacts found to exhibit maker’s marks
or temporally diagnostic characteristics were found on any of the sites, thus significantly limiting
the amount of information known about the sites as a result of the field effort. Subsequent
conversations with Mr. Charles Avery indicated that all 3 of the abandoned homesteads were
occupied by small-time tenant farmers. The largest of the 3 sites, site 41WM1200, was
occupied by the Wallin Family during much of the 20th century. Mr. Avery did not know who
lived in the other 2 homesteads; however, he mentioned that they have been used in recent
times to house seasonal cotton pickers, thus accounting for the modern renovations.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Ultimately, management decisions regarding cultural resource properties are a function
of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Cultural
resources are usually evaluated according to criteria established to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP. Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the

HJN 080027 AR

51

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

criteria presented in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The
4 criteria of eligibility are applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and
related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history (U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service (36 CFR
§60.4)).

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For a cultural resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

7.3

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

The intensive cultural resources survey of the Avery Farms tract resulted in the
documentation of 3 historic-age homesteads—sites 41WM1199, 41WM1200, and 41WM1201.
No prehistoric archeological sites were identified during the survey. Based on the archeological

52

080027_arch_survey_report.docx

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 1400-Acre Avery Farms Tract, Williamson County, Texas

data alone, none of the 3 sites appear to possess any subsurface deposits that would be
deemed significant and qualify them for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D. Similarly,
none of the 3 sites appear to possess any distinctive architecture that would qualify them for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion C. Additionally, information collected from informant
interviews indicates that none of the sites were associated with a significant event or person in
history and, as such, none qualify for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A or B. With this in
mind, it is Horizon’s opinion that no further archeological work is warranted on any of the 3
newly recorded historic sites and that archeological clearance should be granted for the
undertaking. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains or burial furniture are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
property, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the THC
should be notified of the discovery.
