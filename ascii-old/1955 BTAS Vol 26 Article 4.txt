The society was organized and chartered in
pursuit of a literary and scientific undertaking;
for the study of the history, pre-history and the
rna j or artifacts of man and the fossils representing the past floras and faunas of Texas; for the
encouragement of the proper collection and preservation of such artifacts and fossils in museums
and their study and classification and the publication of the results of the researches incident
thereto.
The

BuLLETIN

is published annually for dis-

tribution to members of the society.

STONE-LINED BASIN WITH CHARCOAL IN
LOWER CLEAR FORK SILT
CYRUS

N . RAY

When the writer discovered the deeply buried Gibson
Site midden deposit in January 1930, there then was an
8 inch layer of gravel and red silt at a depth of 24 feet
below the soil surface, which contained considerable charcoal and ashes throughout its exposure of 125 feet, and
several straight hearths of the usual forms and sizes, composed of flat stones 8 to 10 inches across.
These hearths all contained much charcoal, and throughout the gravel layer were flint chips of the kind produced
by nothing else but man's flint-knapping efforts. During
the intervening more than twenty-five years, the writer
has visited the site after rains, and has found a number
of different kinds of artifacts, including a mano stone and
a pocket of more than three hundred small thin flint flakes,
at a depth of 27 feet beneath the soil surface, almost at low
water level.
At the line between the gravel layer at the base of Upper
Clear Fork Silt, and the upper edge of the Lower Clear
Fork Silt, the writer has found several thick percussionfractured leaf-shaped blades on the base of which one larger
flake had been taken off of one face to thin the larger end
for hafting. In 1930 with the inadequate knowledge then
extant on the subject of American primitive man we assumed that it was an early attempt to produce a pre-Folsom
point, and accordingly named it the Abilene Point. Later
research proved that there also were artifacts of differing
forms buried there at least four feet below the gravel layer.
Also several Clear Fork Darts of types 1 and 2 were found
at the same level as the Abilene Points, and the Abilene
Points first found there may have been only some percussion-shaped knives made by Clear Fork men. These expert flint knappers used not only finely made knives and
dart heads but also many roughly fractured, thick, almondshaped knives, and heavy hand axes, spoke shaves and
burins were made by the percussion method. One type of

102

Texas Archeological Society

Clear Fork Culture percussion-fractured knife later found
frequently, closely resembles the original Abilene Points.
These later were found in the Gibson Site buried at the
same 24-foot level, but these usually are much larger than
the original Abilene Points found at the same level.
The Gibson Site is situated at a place where Elm Creek
turns from a north and south course in a bend to the east,
and it is mostly exposed on an east facing bank, but it also
extends for a distance around the bend to the east. Near
the end of this bank on the east the formation shows that
the whole bank there down nearly to water level has been
removed by erosion, and replaced by amorphous silt from
the top level in Nugent Silt 5 times, so that its top is level
with that of the seven ancient Nugent and Clear Fork Silts,
showing in regular banded formations south and west of
it. On Dr. Kirk Bryan's visit to this site in 1946 I pointed
out this replacement to Dr. Bryan and he agreed with me
as to what had happened, and then wanted to give it a
name as a separate and different silt formation. I then told
him that I had already named it the Ft. Griffin Silt, and
had found a lot of it near Ft. Griffin, and had seen it also
in the South Bend site and elsewhere. In these sites most
if not all of the original series of ancient banded silts have
been removed in comparatively recent time, usually at the
level of the bottom of Nugent Silt 5, and then the bank
was replaced from top to bottom with an amorphous and
unhanded sandy refill which may contain elements of anything earlier the floods washed away farther upstream. Some
of these sand bar deposits may have existed long enough
for Indians to have built villages on them as they refilled.
The W.P.A. dug in such a recent river refill of Ft. Griffin
Silt at the Hodges Site, when the whole series of ancient
banded silts lay in regular sequence just south of it.
No extensive digging has ever been done in these strata
and what has been done is only shallow digging into the
bank after artifacts have been found in place. The Gibson
Site has been watched closely since 1930 and it has caved
off a number of feet back into the bank, but the hearths

and artifacts and charcoal strata still keep the same relative
positions that they occupied over 25 years ago.
On September 10, 1955, after some heavy rains, my wife
and I visited the Gibson Site and found that considerable
blocks of silt had caved off, most of it having been washed
away. Located past the eastward bend of the creek, but
a considerable distance west of the Ft. Griffin replacement
area, and in the intact ancient banded deposits of Nugent
and Clear Fork Silts, we found the stones of a rock-lined,
basin-shaped pit projecting from the lowest silt deposit in
the bank, the stratum of Lower Clear Fork Silt. This basin
was rounded in shape like an old type wash basin. The
top edges of the rock basin were 62 inches across, and the
center 13 inches below the upper edges. The cross-section
so outlined contained 15 visible stones, which were firmly
embedded in the hard, dark red silt (Plates 15, 16). The
rains had washed out 39 stones, which lay on the creek bed
slope just below the hearth. Measurement of the loose rocks
below the hearth showed that most of them varied from
7 to 9 inches in length, 4 to 6 inches in width, and 2 to 3
inches in thickness. There are no rocks larger than gravel
size in this whole bank, from bottom to top at this site,
except where hearth accumulations containing much charcoal have washed out, and there is no question that the
hearth rocks were brought from elsewhere and placed
there by man.
The writer dropped an old iron tied to a cord over the
vertical bank above the hearth, while Mrs. Ray held the
iron inside the bottom of the basin. This carefully measured
vertical distance from the soil surface to the basin bottom
was 26 feet 3 inches. The inside depth of the basin being
13 inches, this leaves 25 feet as the distance from the upper
rim of the basin to the soil surface. The rock lining of
course adds to the thickness, and a horizontal layer of
charcoal two inches thick below the bottom adds still more,
which would make the total measurement from the soil
surface to the base of the charcoal layer close to 27 feet.

The charcoal layer was immediately under the stone
basin and had a horizontal length of 43 inches. There was
another hearth of the usual straight line of stones and charcoal situated 47 inches east of the basin. The thickness of
charcoal in it was also about two inches and it was likewise
below the top of the Lower Clear Fork Silt, at the same
depth.
Evidently the makers of these two hearths arrived on
the scene after most of the Lower Clear Fork Silts had
been deposited, dug a basin in the silt down to a probable
depth of 19 inches, burned a quantity of wood in it creating
a bed of coals, and then lined the pit above the charcoal
with flat rocks. Later depositions of Lower Clear Fork Silt
then filled the inside of the basin and covered the whole
structure about a foot deep before the next silt formed
above. The Upper Clear Fork Silt then formed, and so on
up to the present surface with the overburden consisting
of the Lower and Upper Clear Fork Silts and the five
Nugent Silts (Plate 15) .
