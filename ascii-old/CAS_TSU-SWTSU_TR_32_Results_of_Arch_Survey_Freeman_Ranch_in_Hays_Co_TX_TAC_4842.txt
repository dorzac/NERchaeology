Abstract
The Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State University performed an archaeological
survey at Freeman Ranch on behalf of Texas State University (University) on the 3rd and 4th of April,
2008. The University plans to develop, on two separate five acre parcels of University-owned land,
additions to the Freeman Ranch administrative complex and a new forensic studies research facility.
The University’s use of funds issued from State of Texas means that this development is subject to
provisions of the Texas Antiquities Code. Work was carried out by Jon C. Lohse, who served as Principal
Investigator, and CAS archaeologists, David M. Yelacic, who served as Project Archaeologist, and J.
Drew Sitters under the Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4842.
The two separate parcels that the project area consisted of were thoroughly investigated thoroughly
through intensive pedestrian survey and subsurface testing. The portion of the project area that will
include the additions to the Freeman Ranch administrative complex showed no evidence of cultural
material on or below the surface. The portion of the project area where the new forensic studies research
facility is proposed contained buried archaeological deposits. As a result, 41HY447 was recorded.
This site, however, appears to be a deflated upland site of unknown prehistoric age and that does not
hold any potential to contribute to the overall understanding of the region’s cultural record. Based on
these results, CAS concludes that the project area does not contain cultural properties or resources
considered significant to the city’s, state’s, or nation’s history. It is recommended that permission be
granted to proceed with the proposed development.

existing administrative facilities at Freeman
Ranch. The proposed development will impact
two separate parcels, each approximately five
acres in size. According to the Texas State’s
plans, the proposed developments will include
installing new buildings and service drives,
parking spaces, water lines, and approximately
100 linear meters of new roadway.

On April 3rd and 4th, 2008, the Center for
Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State
University–San Marcos performed an intensive
archaeological survey of an approximately 10acre parcel, located in western Hays County,
Texas, on behalf of Texas State University–San
Marcos (Figure 1). Texas State is planning to
develop a new forensic sciences research facility
on the university-owned Freeman Ranch,
additionally, the Texas State will upgrade the

at least one of the following conditions is met
(Rules and Practice, Chapter 41:10):

Texas State University’s use of funds
issued from State of Texas means that this
development is subject to provisions of the Texas
Antiquities Code (TAC). The TAC requires that
these and similar developments be preceded
by archaeological assessments to determine
the possible presence and nature of cultural
resources that would be impacted by proposed
developments. All archaeological work was
performed under auspices of Texas Antiquities
Permit # 4842, granted to Dr. Jon C. Lohse of
CAS.

sufficient to allow application of standard
archaeological techniques to advantage; and/or
(b) the majority of artifacts are in place
so that a significant portion of the site’s
original characteristics can be defined through

Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter
191), which identifies significant sites as State
Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). Should any
historic or prehistoric sites located on land that
is designated for impact during development be
determined eligible for formal designation of
landmark status under the TAC, some measure
of protection or mitigation of impact may be
necessary. The formal designation of SALs and
their administration is the responsibility of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC).

the project area. It also included an intensive
pedestrian survey with subsurface testing.
All of these investigations were conducted in
accordance with the standards of the THC and
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).

The western part of Hays County, where
the Ranch is located, is on the uplifted Edwards
Plateau, an elevated area defined by the steep
Balcones Escarpment on the east (Bureau of
Land Management 2007). The Edwards Plateau is
comprised of Cretaceous limestone and dolomite
that originate from the Trinity, Woodbine, Glen
Rose, Walnut, Edwards, and Fredericksburg
geologic groups (Sellards et al. 1990; Spearing
1991). Water has helped to weather and erode
this karstic region, leaving a sharply undulating
landscape that is incised with stream channels
and that contains extensive subterranean
cavities and sinkholes (Spearing 1991). Rainfall
percolates down through these openings and
recharges underground aquifers and natural
reservoirs, which in turn emerge from the base of
the Balcones Escarpment in the form of artesian
springs.

Under Short Report Format guidelines set
forth by CTA and adopted by the THC, this
report defines the project area setting, provides a
cultural background, describes the methods used
in gathering information, presents the results of
the survey and site assessment of 41HY447, and
offers recommendations on further development
of this land. This survey was performed by
the Principal Investigator, Jon C. Lohse, and
CAS archaeologists, David Yelacic and J. Drew
Sitters.

Definition of the Study Area
The intensive archaeological survey covered
two separate parcels, each approximately five
acres, on the Texas State University-owned
Freeman Ranch (Ranch). Freeman Ranch is
located in western Hays County, in southeastcentral Texas

The nearest intermittent water source to the
project area is Sink Creek, a minor tributary
that joins the San Marcos River, an artesian
spring fed river, below the Escarpment. Stream
systems in this region are characterized by very
high energy rates, particularly during heavy
rainfall events. Given these high energy rates,
topsoil is frequently scoured from bedrock and
unconformable boundaries with missing strata
are common.

Project Area One includes the Ranch’s
existing administrative complex and surrounding
land. This parcel has been heavily disturbed by
previous road and building construction (Figure
2). The undisturbed portion of this first project
area occupies a gentle slope used as pasture.
Project Area Two is approximately one kilometer
to the east of the first, and it occupies the top of
a hill with a sinkhole adjacent to the east. This
second parcel is only slightly disturbed along the
northern boundary by a fence with a two-track
road and utility lines running parallel (Figure
3); this area is also used as pasture, with cattle
present.

Soils
Soils of this area are described in the Soil
Survey of Comal and Hays Counties Texas (Batte
1984). They include Comfort-Rock outcrop
complex, undulating (CrD); Rumple-Comfort
association, undulating (RUD); and Tarpley
clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (TaB). The ComfortRock complex consists of shallow, clayey soils
(Comfort soils) and rock outcrops on side slopes
and hill and ridge tops. Comfort soil is typically

?

dark brown, with a stony clay surface layer of
about six to seven inches in thickness overlying a
subsoil of approximately 12 inches in thickness.
Rumple-Comfort soils consist of shallow to
moderately deep deposits located on uplands and
side slopes. Rumple soils consist of a dark reddish
brown surface layer of cherty clay loam that
averages approximately 10 inches in thickness.
Underlying this is dark reddish brown clay that
extends as much as 28 inches. The moderately
extended depth of these associated deposits
creates the possibility for shallowly-buried
deposits. However, the presence of the soils across
side slopes suggests that they are susceptible to
down-slope movement. Tarpley clays are shallow
soils and occur on gently sloping to nearly-level
uplands in the Plateau. Typically, these soils have
dark brown surface clay about six inches thick
that overlies reddish-brown clay. These clays
build up or aggregate very slowly through in-situ
decomposition of underlying limestone.

1984), this region provides habitats for a wide
range of wildlife including deer, turkey, squirrel,
quail, dove, rabbit, and many nongame birds and
animals.

Central Texas Cultural
Chronology
The cultural chronologies for Central and
South Texas are not completely understood or
agreed upon. However, archaeological deposits
indicate rich cultural development. Black (1995),
Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004)
present the most recent syntheses of the available
chronological evidence of archaeological culture
history in the region. The following cultural
chronology is based on Black (1995), Hester
(1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004). All dates
are in the radiocarbon time scale and given
as years before present (BP, i.e. before 1950).
Human presence is divided into three periods:
Prehistoric, Protohistoric and Historic.

The formation and topographical location of
these soils suggest that any buried archaeological
deposits are deflated and/or are not in-situ.

Prehistoric
The Prehistoric period is divided into
three major styles, the Paleoindian, Archaic
and Late Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage is
characterized by the earliest human occupation
of North America prior to 8,000 BP. The Archaic
stage follows, extending from ca. 8,000 BP to
1,200 BP, and is generally seen as a time during
which humans made successful adaptations
to changing environmental conditions. The
Late Prehistoric stage begins ca. 1,200 BP and
is characterized by a resurgence of grassland
habitats and the development of bow and arrow
and ceramic technologies.

Flora and Fauna
The Freeman Ranch serves as working
pasture for livestock and as hunting grounds
for sportsmen. Thus, some areas have been
cleared for grazing while other areas have been
left pristine for natural game. Both of the areas
that will be affected by construction of the new
administrative and forensic studies research are
current pasture. Short grasses are the dominant
floral species, but some live oak trees (Quercus
virginiana) as well as juniper (Juniperus
monosperma) and mesquite (Prosopis juliflora)
shrubs are scattered throughout (Brockman
1968). Evidence of recent livestock activity was
observed in the first project area, and cattle were
present in the second project area at the time of
field work. As described by Dalton Merz (Batte

Paleoindian
According to Hester (1995:433–436, 2004),
the Paleoindian stage occurred between 11,200–
7,950 BP in South Texas. However, Collins
?

(1995:381–385, 2004) dates it to 11,500–8,800
BP in Central Texas, though he excludes the final
Late Paleoindian interval known as Angostura.
Diagnostic artifacts observed from this stage are
associated with the Clovis, Folsom and a variety
of later Paleoindian cultures (Bousman et al.
2004). The Early Paleoindian stage, consisting
of Clovis and Folsom, is generally characterized
by highly nomadic cultures that relied heavily on
hunting large game animals such as mammoth,
mastodon, bison, camel and horse (Black 1989).
Recent research has shown that Paleoindian
peoples, especially during the Late Paleoindian
substage, also utilized a wide variety of plants
and animals, such as raccoons, badgers, mice,
alligators, turtles and tortoises (Black 1989;
Bousman et al. 2004; Collins and Brown 2000;
Hester 1983).

site, north of Austin (Bousman et al. 2004;
Collins 1998). At Wilson-Leonard, archaeologists
excavated an occupation known as Wilson, named
after the unique stemmed projectile point. The
dense occupation also included a human burial
(Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 1998).

Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) contends the Archaic
stage in Central Texas lasted approximately 7,500
years, from 8,800–1,200/1,300 BP, and divides
the stage into Early, Middle and Late Archaic
(Weir 1976). However, this places the Angostura
interval, often considered to be Late Paleoindian
by other archaeologists, in the Archaic stage.
Therefore other archaeologists suggest that the
Archaic began at 8,000 BP. The Archaic stage
marks several important transitions: a shift from
large game hunting to hunting smaller animals;
the increased use of plant food resources and
use of ground stones in food processing; the
implementation of stone cooking technology;
increased use of organic materials for tool
manufacturing and an increase in the number
and variety of lithic tools for wood working;
the predominance of corner- and side-notch
projectile points; greater population stability and
less residential mobility; and systematic burial
of the dead. This stage is also distinguished by
environmental and climatic changes.

A large distribution of Clovis points across
North and Central America suggests a wide
dispersal of their makers (Wenke 1990:201). These
points are lanceolate in shape, with a thinned
base resulting from “fluting,” or the removal
of one or more channel flakes, and are often
found in association with remains of mammoth,
mastodon, horse, bison, and sometimes camel.
Clovis is followed by Folsom and Midland
points, with Midland slightly overlapping with
Folsom points (Holliday 1997). Folsom points
are fluted and are found in association with
ancient bison remains, while Midland points are
manufactured through pressure collateral flaking,
but lack fluted channels. As most Pleistocene fauna
were extinct by this time, Folsom cultures are
considered to be specialized bison hunters. Most
Folsom sites occur as surface scatters, although
deeply buried deposits have been uncovered.

Early Archaic
Collins and Hester debate the time frame of
the Early Archaic stage in Central Texas. Hester
(1995:436–438, 2004) defines the Early Archaic
with Early Basal Notched and Early Corner
Notched dart points dating between 7,950 and
4,450 BP, while Collins (1995:383, 2004) argues
that the Early Archaic spans from 8,800 to
6,000 BP based on three divisions of projectile
point types. It is generally believed that at the
beginning of the Holocene, a change in climate
led to the extinction of large herds of megafauna,

The Late Paleoindian substage occurs from
ca.10,000–8,000 BP. Reliable evidence for these
dates was recovered from the Wilson-Leonard
?

and stimulated behavioral changes of hunters and
gatherers in South-Central Texas (McKinney
1981). From the outset of the Holocene onwards,
Archaic peoples focused more intensively on
the exploitation of local resources such as deer,
fish and plant bulbs. This dietary adjustment is
evidenced by the increased number of ground
stone artifacts, burned rock midden cooking
features, and more specialized tools such as Clear
Fork gouges and Guadalupe bifaces (Turner and
Hester 1993:246–256). Early Archaic sites are
thinly dispersed and are seen across a wide area
of Texas and northern Mexico (Weir 1976).

sotol (Johnson and Goode 1994). These plants
were typically baked in earth ovens, reflected
in the development of burned rock middens.
During drier episodes, the aquifer-fed streams
and resource-rich environments of Central Texas
were extensively utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir
1976:125, 128).

Late Archaic
The Central Texas Late Archaic dates to
approximately 4,000–1,300/1,200 BP (Collins
1995:384, 2004). The herds of bison began
returning to the southern Great Plains, again
influencing the subsistence strategies (Dillehay
1974).. Some archaeologists note the presence
of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall
1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) as
evidence that populations indeed increased and
that groups were becoming territorial (Story
1985:44–45). Others challenge the interpretation
by citing a decrease in burned rock middens
(Prewitt 1981:80–81). Pottery, which often
accompanies increased sedentism, territoriality,
and population growth, began appearing in
limited areas of the South Texas Plains. However,
most regions remained “pre-ceramic” for another
thousand years (Story 1985:45–47).

Middle Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) divides the Middle
Archaic, 4,000–6,000 BP, into three projectile
point style intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek;
Taylor; and Nolan and Travis. The Middle
Archaic is marked by the onset of the Altithermal,
a climatic period of warmer temperatures and
increasing aridity. The Bell-Andice-Calf Creek
interval was a mesic period when grasslands
expanded southwards into Central and South
Texas, followed by bison herds from the
Plains. Bell-Andice-Calf Creek peoples were
specialized bison hunters who followed the herds
southwards, bringing with them a lithic tool kit
specifically adapted to killing and processing
bison. As the Altithermal progressed, conditions
in South and Central Texas became warmer and
drier, and the bison and bison hunters retreated
northwards. During this period, Taylor bifaces
were manufactured, which are bifaces similar to
the earlier Bell-Andice-Calf Creek peoples, but
lack notching. By the latter part of the Middle
Archaic, Taylor bifaces were replaced by Nolan
and Travis points, which are technologically and
stylistically dissimilar to the two preceding styles
(Collins 1995, 2004). The Nolan-Travis interval
was also a period when temperature and aridity
were at their greatest levels, and there is evidence
of increased utilization of xerophytes such as

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Late
Prehistoric in Central Texas at 1,300/1,200–260
BP, and follows Kelly (1947) in dividing it into
Austin and Toyah phases. This stage is marked
by the introduction of new technologies. The
most significant changes include a technological
shift away from the dart and atlatl to the bow
and arrow, the incorporation of pottery (Black
1989:32; Story 1985:45–47).

Austin Phase
The Austin phase is characterized by the
appearance of small arrow points, such as
Edwards and Scallorn types, which indicate a
?

shift from the use of atlatls to bows. Burned rock
middens are occasionally found with these types
of points (Houk and Lohse 1993). Ground and
pecked stone tools used for plant food processing,
which first appeared during the Archaic, are
increasingly common in the Austin phase.
Burials from this time reveal a high proportion
of arrow-wound deaths (Black 1989; Meissner
1991; Prewitt 1974), suggesting that population
growth resulted in disputes over limited resource
availability.

These encounters began with the venture into
Texas by the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
and the Narvaez expedition in 1528. The period
is generally dated between 1500 and 1700 (or
1528, the date of the Cabeza de Vaca/Narvaez
expedition, to the establishment of the first
Spanish mission, Mission San Antonio de Valero
in 1718).
When the Spanish missions were established
in East Texas in the late 1600s, entradas began
to travel regularly through Central Texas. With
Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680, El Camino
Real (the King’s Road) was established from
Villa Santiago de la Monclova in Mexico to East
Texas. This roadway followed established Native
American trade routes and trails and became a
vital link between Mission San Juan Bautista in
Northern Mexico and the Spanish settlement of
Los Adaes in East Texas (McGraw et al. 1991).

Toyah Phase
The beginning of the Toyah phase (800 BP)
in Central Texas is discernible by contracting
stem points with flaring, barbed shouldered
points. The Perdiz point is a classic example
(Black 1989:32; Huebner 1991:346). This phase is
also characterized by the introduction of bladelet
technology that included prismatic blades, blade
cores, and scrapers-on-blades, considered to be
part of a specialized Toyah bison hunting and
processing toolkit (Black and McGraw 1985;
Huebner 1991; Ricklis 1994). Toyah is also
characterized by the appearance of bone-tempered
pottery in Central Texas (Johnson 1994:241–
281). The wide variety of ceramic styles and
influences seen throughout Toyah phase ceramic
assemblages provide important information on
the social composition of these cultural groups
(Arnn 2005). Toyah phase ceramic assemblages
display Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast, and Jornada
Mogollon influences (Arnn 2005).

Spanish priests accompanying entradas
provided the most complete information of
indigenous cultures of early Texas. Those
documented during the early entradas include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane,
who were settled around the springs at San
Marcos. They were described as small bands
that roamed between the rivers hunting game
and gathering wild plant foods. Other tribes
encountered at San Marcos included mobile
hunting parties from villages in South and West
Texas, such as Catequeza, Cayanaaya, Chalome,
Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading for bison
hunting grounds in the Blackland Prairies (Foster
1995:265–289; Johnson and Campbell 1992;
Newcomb 1993). Later groups migrated into the
region and displaced the former groups or tribes.
These included the Tonkawa from Oklahoma and
Lipan and Comanche from the Plains (Campbell
and Campbell 1985; Dunn 1911; Newcomb 1961,
1993).

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada
Period)
In Texas, the Protohistoric period, also known
as the Spanish Entrada period, was marked by
Spanish entradas, the formal expeditions from
established forts and missions in Northern Mexico
into Central, Coastal, and East Texas in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.

?

Archaeological sites dated to this period
typically contain a mix of both European
imported goods, such as metal objects and glass
beads, and traditional Native American artifacts,
such as manufactured stone tools.

Site 41HY79 was a lithic resource
procurement locality on the surface, and the site
was bisected by a “jeep road” (Patterson and Ivey
1974). Artifacts observed at this site included
biface fragments, bifacial preforms, flint flakes,
cores and a scraper. The site was delineated
horizontally but lacked subsurface testing. The
potential of intact buried deposits and the lack
of vertical delineation resulted in further work
being recommended in the form of trenches and
test units to find the depth range of the site.

Historic
Spanish settlement in Central Texas first
occurred in San Antonio with the establishment
of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo)
in 1718, and the later founding of San Antonio
de Béxar (Bolton 1970; Habig 1977; de la Teja
1995). Some researchers demarcate the transition
in Texas between the Entrada (Protohistoric)
and Historic periods by the construction of the
first Spanish missions in Texas during the early
eighteenth century. Most of our knowledge of
this period is gained through the written records
of the early Spanish missionaries. Besides the
mission town of San Antonio, the only other
Spanish settlement in the region was San Marcos
de Neve, established in 1808, four miles south of
present day San Marcos. San Marcos de Neve was
abandoned in 1812 as a result of constant raids
by local tribes (Dobie 1932). During this time,
massive depopulation occurred among the Native
Americans, mostly due to European diseases to
which the indigenous people had little resistance.
Those few remaining were nearly all displaced to
reservations by the mid-1850s (Fisher 1998).

Site 41HY80 was a surficial lithic resource
locality, also bisected by a “jeep road” and
containing biface fragments and performs,
cores, and flakes (Patterson and Ivey 1974). No
subsurface testing was performed in order to
examine the depth of this cultural deposit, but
because of its location adjacent to a stream bed,
no further work was recommended.

Methods
The current archeological investigation
consisted of a 100 percent systematic, intensive
pedestrian survey which included subsurface
testing within the project area boundaries. As
mandated by the minimum survey standards
adopted by the THC for project areas of this size,
no less than one shovel test for every two acres
is required. CAS evenly spaced and excavated
10 shovel tests across each of the 5 acre parcels,
and an additional 8 shovel tests were excavated in
order to further delineate three shovel tests that
contained cultural material.

Previous Archaeological
Investigations
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archaeological Site Atlas Database showed
that no sites were located within one kilometer
of the current project area. Two sites, however,
are located on the Freeman Ranch, 41HY79
and 41HY80. Both sites were recorded during
a survey of the San Marcos River Watershed in
1974 (Patterson and Ivey 1974).

Each shovel test, approximately 30 cm in
diameter, was excavated in 20 cm arbitrary levels
to a maximum depth of ~52 cmbs (centimeters
below surface). All of the excavated sediment
was passed through a ¼” hardware screen, and
if artifacts were present, they were collected in
4 mil bags labeled with the corresponding level’s

provenience and placed in the bottom of the
shovel test pit at the completion of the excavation.
Observations and comments pertaining to each
probe were recorded by the excavator. Once all
excavations were complete, the shovel test pits
were filled back in.

The second area of impact is approximately
one kilometer east of the first, and shares a hill
top with a sinkhole to its east. Currently, this
project area includes modern disturbances such
as a two-track road with paralleling fence and
utility lines suspended by cement poles (see
Figure 3). Together, these modern features make
up approximately 20 percent of the project area.
The remaining portion of the second project area
is pastureland and was thoroughly investigated
with 18 shovel tests (Figure 5).

Results
Both project areas, approximately five
acres each, were thoroughly inspected on the
surface and subsurface. The results from this
intensive archaeological survey will be presented
separately for each area. A single site, 41HY447,
was recorded in Project Area Two; this site is
described in that section of the report.

On the south side of the fence, just outside of
the project area’s linear portion, surface scatters of
chert were observed in association with outcrops
of bedrock. These surface scatters included
cobbles and smaller fragments. They were not
distinctly cultural, and, with their location on a
cattle trail/two-track road, could possibly have
been created by trampling and/or modern vehicle
traffic.

Project Area One
The first project area occupies a gentle slope
and includes the Ranch’s current administrative
complex. There are pens for livestock, three
buildings, several parking spaces, three roads,
and a courtyard in the vicinity of this project
area. Approximately 50 percent of the parcel has
already been disturbed with the construction
of these features. The remaining, undisturbed
portion of this project area is pastureland with
evidence of recent livestock activity.

Four evenly spaced shovel tests (1–4)
examined the linear portion of the second project
area for cultural deposits; no shovel test yielded
cultural materials. The sediment on this hilltop is
shallow, gravelly clay loam, and with the exception
of Shovel Test 1 which was terminated at sterile,
red clay approximately 38 cmbs, these shovel
tests reached bedrock between approximately 20
and 52 cmbs (Figure 6).

Three shovel tests focused on the area of
main impact with the construction of additional
administrative buildings; these shovel tests were
located in the south corner of the project area
(Figure 4). The seven remaining shovel tests were
spread evenly across the undisturbed portion of
land. The sediments on this karst terrain were
shallow, gravelly clay loams; bedrock was reached
between 20 - 40 cmbs. No prehistoric cultural
remains were visible on the surface, and all 10
shovel tests were devoid of cultural material.

Six shovel tests were left to examine the
rectangular portion of Project Area Two. Aside
from Shovel Test 8 which was positive and required
eight more shovel tests to delineate, these shovel
tests were similar to those in the linear portion
of this project area. The sediment was shallow,
gravelly clay loam. The two southern shovel
tests (7 and 10) reached bedrock at a maximum

of approximately 42 cmbs. Two shovel tests in
the northeastern corner of this area also reached
bedrock at a shallow depth of approximately 38
cmbs. Shovel Test 9, in the northwest corner of
this area, was terminated at approximately 35
cmbs, 10 cm into sterile red, clay.

Cultural materials wre encountered in three
shovel tests (8, 11 and 12). Six more shovel tests
(13–16 and 27–28) were excavated to further
delineate this find. On the basis of the positive
shovel tests, site 41HY447 was recorded. The site
is a deflated, upland prehistoric site of unknown
age, located at the center of the second project
area. Shovel Test 8, at the center of the rectangular
portion of Project Area Two, contained cultural
material. At approximately 15 cmbs, in shallow,
gravelly clay loam, a unifacial flake tool was
recovered. This tool was made on a primary flake
fragment; approximately 80 percent of the dorsal

All of the shovel tests in Project Area Two
contained a mixture of calcareous and cherty
rocks. The common cherty rocks appeared to be
battered, but because of their shallow depth and
context among gravel and calcareous rocks, they
were considered not distinctly cultural in most
cases.

side was covered in cortex, and the ventral side
was smooth chert with some seemingly natural
battering (Figure 7). Several flakes were taken
off of the dorsal side along a long axis, creating
a working edge. This was the only evidence of
cultural remains in this shovel test.

Approximately five meters to the east of
Shovel Test 8, Shovel Test 12 was excavated. At
10 cmbs, an early stage biface or bifacial core
was recovered. This tool was severly battered,
but had one edge which was bifacially worked
(Figure 8). Shovel Test 12 was especially shallow
and gravelly, and the biface was the only cultural
material recovered.

Shovel Test 11 was excavated approximately
five meters to the north of Shovel Test 8. Shovel
Test 11 contained a possible core found in the
first arbitrary level, 0 – 20 cmbs. This cherty rock
was approximately 15 cm on its long axis and 10
cm thick; it had evidence of natural battering,
but it was also evident that several flakes had
been taken off of it. This possible core was
found in shallow, gravelly clay loam, and it was
accompanied by cherty pebbles and fragments
that were not distinctly cultural.

Shovel tests approximately five meters to the
south and to the west of Shovel Test 8 yielded
no cultural material. A shovel test approximately
five meters to the north of Shovel Test 11 yielded
no cultural material, and likewise, a shovel test
approximately 5 m to the east of Shovel Test
12 had no cultural remains. Two more shovel
tests, one approximately 10 m to the west and
another approximately 7 m southwest of Shovel

to the city or State’s history under any criteria
of the Texas Antiquities Code. Site 41HY447 was
identified and recorded, but is a deflated, sparse
lithic scatter that appears to hold no potential to
contribute meaningfully to the understanding
of the region’s prehistory. Accordingly, CAS
concludes that no additional archaeological
investigations are necessary and recommends
that Texas State University–San Marcos be
granted regulatory clearance to proceed with
their plans to construct the proposed forensic
research facility.

Recommendations
The background literature and site file
research, as well as the intensive pedestrian
survey and shovel tests, reveal that no prehistoric
or historic deposits are present in the project area
that could be construed as potentially significant
