INTRODUCTION
The General Services Administration (GSA) is planning an expansion of the facilities at the
World Trade Bridge in Laredo and the Columbia-Solidarity International Bridge across from
Columbia, Neuvo Leon, Mexico (Figure 1). Prior to beginning construction, the GSA required a
reconnaissance survey of the affected properties to determine if significant cultural resources
would be impacted by the proposed construction. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), Plano, Texas,
conducted the cultural resources investigations (GMI project number 30576.00.05.01). Fieldwork
was conducted on December 4, 2007, by Steven Hunt of GMI. Melissa Green, also of GMI,
served as the Principal Investigator for the project. Mr. Joe Cantu and Mr. Leo Lozano of the
GSA Laredo field office served as our escorts to the World Trade and Columbia-Solidarity
International bridges, respectively.

COLUMBIA-SOLIDARITY INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE
The Columbia-Solidarity International Bridge (also known as Bridge III) is about 19 miles
northwest of Laredo along FM 1472 and 2 miles northeast of Columbia, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. It
opened in 1991 (Keller Koch Realtors 2007). The project area consists of a 9.6-acre tract
between an existing parking lot and a gravel road (Figures 2, 3, and 4). The gravel road forms the
southwestern boundary, and the northeastern boundary is roughly parallel to the edge of the City
of Laredo parking lot. The southeastern boundary includes the roads to the inspection station and
a median. The northwestern boundary had to be estimated, but appeared to coincide with the
edge of an excavated area (Figure 5).
The project area can be divided into two major zones. The zone in the northeastern two-thirds of
the project area is relatively flat, with a gentle slope toward the border inspection station at the
southeastern end. A long berm noted along the southwestern edge of this area is associated with
asphalt dumping (Figure 6, see Figure 4). Although the origin of this berm could not be
definitively determined, the vegetation observed and gravel pavement suggests that it is the
original ground surface (Figure 7). If this supposition is correct, much of the original ground
surface northeast of the berm has been removed (Figure 8). The southwestern third of the project
area consists of a steep slope estimated at 6 meters (m; 20 feet [ft]) tall, leading down to a flat
landform adjacent to the gravel road (Figure 9). Ground surface visibility varied across the
project area, but is estimated at 30-40 percent overall. The median between the roads has been
landscaped to funnel water to a drainage sump (Figure 10).
Numerous indications of disturbance were noted in the project area. A fire hydrant and sewer
manhole were observed along the northeast edge (Figures 11 and 12, see Figure 4), and a fiber
optic cable sign and utility box with associated concrete covers were observed along the berm
(Figures 13 and 14). Large piles of asphalt were noted at the north end of the berm (see Figure
4), and several large spoil piles were noted (Figures 15 and 16; see Figure 9). Finally, a concrete
slab was observed downslope from the end of the berm (Figure 17).

WORLD TRADE BRIDGE
The World Trade Bridge (also known as Bridge IV) is at the intersection of Loop 20 and the Rio
Grande in northwestern Laredo. The bridge was completed in 2000 (Federal Highway
Administration 2007). The GSA proposes adding two new vehicle inspection lanes and widening
an existing lane within the current project area. The map provided by GSA (Figure 18) showed
the location of four new lanes on the north side and three new lanes on the south side, but did not
indicate the exact location of the improvements currently under consideration, nor was our escort
aware of their location. Consequently, a larger area comprising approximately 28.5 acres was
examined to ensure that the proposed improvements were covered (Figures 19 and 20).
The project area is discussed in two sections: north and south of the existing vehicle lanes. The
area north of the vehicle lanes is nearly level and covered with grasses that vary in density across
the area (Figure 21); ground surface visibility is estimated at 30 percent overall. Utilities are
common within this area, consisting of light poles, electrical utility boxes, and fire hydrants
(Figure 22). The administration building area in the western part is largely disturbed by the
construction of the building and associated parking lot (Figure 23), as well as a large drainage
sump (Figure 24).
The area south of the vehicle lanes is also nearly level, with at most 1.5 m (5 ft) of relief (Figure
25), except at the far western edge, which appears to be built up to accommodate the road from
Mexico, and is an estimated 4.5 m (15 ft) tall (Figure 26). It consists of a narrow band between
the vehicle lanes and the boundary fence. Vegetation coverage varies across the area, but ground
surface visibility is estimated at 50 percent. Many utilities were noted in this area (Figures 27 and
28).

The many utility boxes, light poles, and fire hydrants in the project area indicate that extensive
disturbances have occurred. Furthermore, a comparison of the existing project area with the
Laredo West quadrangle (1965, photorevised 1980) indicates that extensive cut-and-fill occurred
during construction. Today, the area from the center of the project area to the east end exhibits
approximately 1.5 m (5 ft) of relief; the same area on the Laredo West quadrangle shows over
6 m (20 ft) of relief (see Figure 19). An indication of the extent of these excavations can be seen
at the north edge of the bridge complex (Figure 29).

GEOLOGY

Columbia-Solidarity International Bridge
The Columbia-Solidarity International Bridge project area proved difficult to plot on the Bureau
of Economic Geology (BEG) Laredo Sheet due to a lack of readily identifiable landmarks.
However, the project area appears to be near the boundary between a narrow band of Fluviatile
terrace deposits along the Rio Grande and El Pico Clay, which forms the dominant bedrock
material in this area. Although not present in the project area, small exposures of Uvalde Gravel
occur along FM 1429 to the northeast. Holocene alluvium is mapped along Santo Tomas Creek
to the north.

20

Fluviatile terrace deposits are Pleistocene in origin and are composed of gravels, sands, silts, and
clay that are similar in composition to adjacent Holocene alluvial deposits. El Pico Clay is an
Eocene deposit between 274–351 m (900–1,150 ft) thick and is composed of clay, sandstone, and
coal. The clays are medium gray to brown in color and are in part gypsiferous. The sandstone is
gray to brown in color and is generally fine-grained, although some medium- to coarse-grained
deposits exist (BEG 1976).
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS) has mapped the ColumbiaSolidarity International Bridge project area near the boundary between the Jimenez-Quemado
complex, undulating, and LaGloria silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Sanders and Gabriel 1985).
Jimenez-Quemado complex, undulating, is a shallow to very shallow soil found on the summit
and side slopes of hills and ridges. The soil complex is composed of 40 to 55 percent Jimenez
soils (which are typically found on slopes) and 30 to 50 percent Quemado soils (which occupy the
summits). The remaining 0 to 30 percent of the complex may consist of contrasting soils or rock
outcrops. The representative Jimenez profile begins with a very gravelly sandy clay loam 33
centimeters (cm; 14 inches [in]) thick that is dark brown in the upper 23 cm (9 in) and brown in
the lower 10 cm (4 in). This is underlain by strongly cemented caliche to a depth of 64 cm
(25 in), and weakly cemented, very gravelly caliche to 152 cm (60 in) below surface. Quemado
soils begin with a reddish brown, very gravelly sandy loam A horizon about 15 cm (6 in) thick
that is underlain by a reddish brown, very gravelly sandy clay loam B horizon from 15 to 30 cm
(6–12 in) below surface. This in turn is underlain by strongly cemented caliche from 30 to 36 cm
(12–14 in) below surface, and a very gravelly, weakly cemented caliche from 36 to 152 cm (14–
60 in) below surface (Sanders and Gabriel 1985:26–27, 78–79, 83–84).
LaGloria silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, is a deep and nearly level soil found on smooth terraces
parallel to the Rio Grande. The typical soil profile begins with a pale brown silt loam
approximately 48 cm (19 in) thick. This is underlain by a pale brown loam B horizon from 48 to
107 cm (19–42 in) below surface. This in turn is underlain by light yellowish brown loam C
horizon from 107 to 160 cm (42–63 in) below surface (Sanders and Gabriel 1985:27–29, 79).

World Trade Bridge
The situation at the World Trade Bridge is much clearer than for the Columbia-Solidarity
International Bridge; the BEG has mapped the project area at a boundary between Fluviatile
terrace deposits and Uvalde Gravel. Fluviatile terrace deposits are Pleistocene in origin and are
composed of gravels, sands, silts, and clay that are similar in composition to adjacent Holocene
alluvial deposits. Uvalde Gravel is of Pleistocene or Pliocene age and is characterized by
deposits of well-rounded chert cobbles and pebbles. The deposits are about 6 m (20 ft) thick
(BEG 1976).
The SCS has mapped the World Trade Bridge project area primarily in the Jimenez-Quemado
complex, undulating, although a small area of Verick fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes, may
be present toward the eastern end (Sanders and Gabriel 1985). Jimenez-Quemado complex,
undulating, is a shallow to very shallow soil found on the summit and side slopes of hills and
ridges. The soil complex is composed of 40 to 55 percent Jimenez soils (which are typically
found on slopes) and 30 to 50 percent Quemado soils (which occupy the summits). The
remaining 0 to 30 percent of the complex may consist of contrasting soils or rock outcrops. The
representative Jimenez profile begins with a very gravelly sandy clay loam 33 (cm; 14 in) thick
21

that is dark brown in the upper 23 cm (9 in) and brown in the lower 10 cm (4 in). This is
underlain by strongly cemented caliche to a depth of 64 cm (25 in), and weakly cemented, very
gravelly caliche to 152 cm (60 in) below surface. Quemado soils begin with a reddish brown,
very gravelly sandy loam A horizon about 15 cm (6 in) thick that is underlain by a reddish brown,
very gravelly sandy clay loam B horizon from 15 to 30 cm (6–12 in) below surface. This in turn
is underlain by strongly cemented caliche from 30 to 36 cm (12–14 in) below surface, and a very
gravelly, weakly cemented caliche from 36 to 152 cm (14–60 in) below surface (Sanders and
Gabriel 1985:26–27, 78–79, 83–84).
Verick fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes, is a shallow, gently sloping soil that forms on the
summit and side slopes of low hills. The representative soil profile begins with a yellowish
brown A horizon about 23 cm (9 in) thick. The underlying subsoil is a light yellowish brown fine
sandy clay loam found from 23 to 38 cm (9–15 in) below surface. The underlying bedrock
consists of light yellowish brown, weakly cemented sandstone found from 38 cm to over 152 cm
(15–60 in) below surface (Sander and Gabriel 1985:36–37, 85–86).

METHODS
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was consulted prior to beginning fieldwork to determine if
any previously recorded sites existed within a 1-mile radius of the project areas. Several
archeological projects have occurred near the Columbia-Solidarity International Bridge, including
survey and excavation before the bridge was built (Barile 2002; McGraw and Thompson 1998).
Other nearby cultural resources projects include the proposed Camino Columbia Toll Road
(Davis 1992), a proposed railroad bridge (Clay and Darnell 2007), a Texas Historical
Commission investigation of the Darwin Community (Kenmotsu 1990), and a survey of the City
of Laredo Columbia Waste Water Treatment Plant (Sanchez and Dusek 2006). In all, nine sites
(41WB205, 41WB206, 41WB291, 41WB292, 41WB340, 41WB341, 41WB657, 41WB664, and
41WB667) were recorded within a 1-mile radius of the project area (Table 1). Another site
(41WB668) is located just outside the 1-mile radius and is also summarized in Table 1. The
nearest site to the project area is 41WB205 (Darwin Town and Coal Mine), which is
approximately 100 m northeast.
Archeological investigations near the World Trade Bridge have largely consisted of the TxDOT
(Meade and McGraw 1998) and Parsons Brinckerhoff (Voellinger and Geiselbrecht 1999)
investigations prior to bridge construction. A total of eight sites (41WB384, 41WB427,
41WB428, 41WB429, 41BW430, 41WB431, 41WB534, and 41WB602) are plotted within a 1mile radius of the project area (Table 2). A portion of site 41WB384 is mapped in the west
central part of the project area, and site 41WB534 is mapped crossing the southwest corner of the
project area. On the report abstract form submitted to the Texas Historical Commission (THC),
Voellinger and Geiselbrecht stated that site 41WB384 “does not appear to possess potentially
significant information, and construction clearance has been given by the State Historic
Preservation Office,” and site 41WB534 possessed “buried archaeological deposits potentially
capable of yielding significant information” and that the bridge “[c]onstruction plans have been
altered in order to avoid adverse affects to 41WB534” (THC 2007).
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and the National Park Service website were both checked to
determine if any National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)-listed properties exist within a 1mile radius of the project area. The National Park Service lists only eight NRHP properties

within Webb County: six are in Laredo, one is in Mirando City, and the eighth is the Palafox
historic and archeological district. None of these properties are within the project areas.
Similarly, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas showed no NRHP-listed properties within the 1mile radius of the projects.
Due to the good ground surface visibility present in the project areas, the archeological survey
was conducted largely through surface inspection. Limited shovel testing was also undertaken to
evaluate contextual integrity as well as to check for subsurface deposits. Shovel tests were
approximately 35 cm (14 in) in diameter and were excavated in 20-cm (8 in) arbitrary levels to
subsoil. The soils and artifacts (if any) encountered in the shovel tests were recorded on a
standardized form. Digital photographs were taken to document the survey conditions, the degree
of disturbance, and any cultural deposits encountered.

An architectural evaluation was also required for any structures within a half-block area of
potential effects (APE). Neither the Laredo West (1965, photorevised 1960) nor Delores Ranch
(1965) quadrangles shows any structures near the World Trade Bridge or Columbia-Solidarity
International Bridge, respectively. Consequently, an architectural evaluation is deemed
unnecessary.

RESULTS

Columbia-Solidarity International Bridge
Surface inspection noted many broken chert cobbles and gravels across much of the project area,
but only two flakes in the northern part of the area were definitely cultural in origin (see Figure
3). Furthermore, one of the flakes was observed in an excavated area (Figure 30). A small
historic scatter noted in the northeast corner contained three pieces of manganese solarized glass
(1880–1920) and three pieces of porcelain. One of the porcelain fragments is a basal sherd
embossed “CC.” This part of the project is closest to site 41WB205 (Darwin town and coal mine)
and likely represents outlying material from that occupation. Elsewhere in the project area,
24

widely scattered pieces of clear, brown, and green glass were occasionally encountered. The age
of the materials, late nineteenth through early twentieth centuries, coincides with the occupation
of Darwin.
In addition, four shovel tests were excavated in the survey area (Table 3). None of the shovel
tests contained any cultural materials. Two of the shovel tests (Shovel Tests 2 and 3) had subsoil
exposed at the surface.

The surface inspection of this project area found an intermittent, low-density scatter of lithic
artifacts consisting primarily of debitage, but with a small number of biface fragments and a
preform also observed. These materials are mostly likely derived from site 41BW384, although
the evidence for cutting and filling in this area suggests that the artifacts were redeposited as fill.
In addition, three shovel tests were excavated on the north side of the existing lanes (see Figure
20). Shovel Tests 1 and 2 were sterile (Table 4), and Shovel Test 3 contained a flake in the upper
30 cm. Once again, this artifact was likely redeposited.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The Columbia-Solidarity International Bridge project area occupies an upland ridge overlooking
the Rio Grande. The northwestern two-thirds of the project area appears to have been impacted
by historic excavations, possibly related to the nearby Darwin mine. Other disturbances noted
within the project area include a fiber optic cable and a utility box with associated concrete covers
along a berm; a fire hydrant and sewer manhole along the northeastern edge; and a concrete slab
in the southeastern part of the project area. Although many broken chert gravels and cobbles
were noted, the only definite culturally modified lithics were two widely scattered flakes found in
the northwest corner. The northwest corner also contained a small scatter of historic artifacts that
are probably outliers from the nearby Darwin town and coal mine (41WB205). Neither the flakes
nor the historic artifacts were considered to represent an intensive occupation of the property and
were not considered as sites. As a result of these investigations, it is recommended that no
significant cultural deposits exist within the project area and the proposed construction should be
allowed to proceed.
The World Trade Bridge occupies a gently sloping upland area overlooking the Rio Grande. This
setting appears to be the result of cutting and filling during the construction of the bridge
complex, a contention supported by the deep cuts noted along the north wall of the complex and
the fill used in the road construction on the southwest corner (see Figure 26). An intermittent,
low-density lithic scatter was found across much of the project area and is likely originally
derived from site 41WB384. A flake found in Shovel Test 3 is probably derived from the same
deposits. Given the evidence for cutting and filling within the project area, these artifacts are
thought to be in redeposited context. In any event, site 41WB384 was determined ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP prior to the initial construction of the bridge complex. Site 41WB534
26

crosses the southwest corner of the bridge complex and is considered to have good research
potential outside of the current complex fence. Inside the fence however, the site has already
experienced impacts from the construction of the complex. An occasional flake was noted in the
built-up berm, indicating that some of the soil from the surrounding area was used, as was some
fill, to level the area for the traffic lanes. Also there is the presence of buried electrical utility
lines and utility boxes along the fence. Given these results, the construction of the new vehicle
lanes is not likely to further impact the portion of site 41WB534 inside the fenced complex and is
considered to have no impact upon significant cultural deposits.
