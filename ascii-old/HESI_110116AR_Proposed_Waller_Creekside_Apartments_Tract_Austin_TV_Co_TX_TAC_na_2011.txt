Proposed Waller Creekside Apartments Tract, Austin, Travis County, Texas

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

51st Living, Ltd. (51st Living), is proposing to construct a low-income apartment complex
on the Waller Creekside Apartments tract, an approximately 6.6-acre (ac) tract of land in north
Austin, Travis County, Texas. The Waller Creekside Apartments tract is located off the south
side of West 51st Street between Rowena and Guadalupe streets across the street from the
Austin State Hospital (ASH) Cemetery.
The project is being sponsored by 51st Living, a private real estate developer, on
privately owned land utilizing funding provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD). As such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended. As the project represents a
publicly sponsored undertaking with the potential to impact significant cultural resources,
51st Living was required to provide for a cultural resources assessment of the project’s Area of
Potential Effect (APE) to assess the project’s possible impacts on any significant cultural
resources in the APE.
Preliminary consultation undertaken with the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
resulted in the determination that the project area did not need to be surveyed for cultural
resources in its entirety. However, as the proposed project area is located immediately across
West 51st Street from the historic-age ASH Cemetery, the THC believed that the northernmost
portion of the tract that abuts West 51st Street had a relatively high potential to contain
unmarked graves associated with the ASH Cemetery to the north. As such, the THC required
that mechanical scraping be conducted along the northern edge of the tract that abuts West
51st Street to assess the potential for unmarked graves within the project area. The THC
stipulated that mechanical scraping operations should extend at least 30 to 50 feet (ft) back
from the northern property line abutting West 51st Street to assess whether or not any
unmarked graves exist within this portion of the property. In the event that any unmarked
graves were found to exist within the Waller Creekside Apartments property, provisions of the
Texas Health and Safety Code (Chapter 711) would additionally apply to the project, and
mechanical scraping would need to be extended farther south until the maximum extent of the
cemetery within the property’s boundaries could be determined. Any decisions made regarding
unmarked graves on the Waller Creekside Apartments tract or the potential exhumation of
graves would fall under the jurisdiction of both the Texas Health and Safety Code and the NHPA
and would require coordination with the THC. Thus, the APE of the proposed undertaking was

defined as a work zone extending a minimum of 30 to 50 ft back from the northern property line,
which measures approximately 515 ft in length along the south side of West 51st Street.
To meet its responsibilities under applicable federal and state laws, 51st Living
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to obtain all necessary
clearances for cultural resources. From September 26 to 30, 2011, Horizon archeologists
conducted mechanical operations along the northern edge of the Waller Creekside Apartments
tract to assess the potential for unmarked graves associated with the historic-age ASH
Cemetery to exist within the property’s boundaries. Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator,
supervised the field investigations and monitored mechanical scraping and trenching
operations; Michael Mudd, archeological field technician, assisted with monitoring the
excavations; and Jared Wiersema and Chris Carrell operated the machinery.
Initially, the proposed methodology for the mechanical operations consisted of scraping
off the modern ground surface and any underlying layers of artificial fill to expose the original
19th-century ground surface so that the natural, historic-age ground surface could be inspected
for grave shafts within a 30- to 50-foot-wide strip along the northern edge of the property. In
addition to the scraping operations, backhoe trenches were to be excavated at approximately
50-foot intervals along this strip to a sufficient depth to determine whether or not the exposed
soils were, in fact, natural and therefore conducive to identifying intrusive grave shafts. Upon
initiating the fieldwork, it immediately became apparent that this methodology would not be
practicable due to several constraining factors, and the methodology had to be adjusted several
times during the week of fieldwork. THC staff members visited the project area on 3 separate
occasions while fieldwork was being conducted. Mark Denton, coordinator of the State and
Federal Review Section of the Archeology Division, visited the site all 3 times; Anne Shelton,
cemetery preservation coordinator, visited twice; and Brad Jones and Pat Mercado-Allinger
each visited once. THC personnel were able to inspect mechanical operations as they were in
progress and after they were completed, and the necessary changes to the field methodology
were developed in consultation with THC staff, primarily Mark Denton, while they were on-site.
The proposed Waller Creek Apartments tract represents the former site of the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) Academy training facility and consists of a mix of open,
grassy fields; paved parking lots and driveways; and abandoned brick buildings that appear to
have been constructed in the 1960s or 1970s. The northern boundary of the tract abutting West
51st Street measures approximately 515 ft in length. The easternmost segment of the APE,
extending approximately 108 ft in length westward from the eastern property line, consists of an
open grassy field. Initially, scraping operations commenced by removing long, continuous strips
of overburden with the blade of a small trackhoe. However, it was immediately discovered that
the ground was so dry and sediments were so compact as the result of a year-long drought that
continuous scraping operations would not be feasible as it simply was not possible to dislodge
sediments below a depth of about 10 centimeters (cm) below surface. Inspection of the
alignment of tombstones in the southeastern portion of the ASH Cemetery, located immediately
north of West 51st Street across from the eastern portion of the APE, suggested that the rows of
graves extend along a roughly northeast-to-southwest axis, following the current eastern
property line of the cemetery. It was anticipated that a “checkerboard” pattern of trenches,

110116_arch_assessment_report

Proposed Waller Creekside Apartments Tract, Austin, Travis County, Texas

excavated along a more or less north-to-south orientation, would cut across any rows of burials
that may extend into the APE, thereby providing an opportunity to identify any grave shafts in
trench wall profiles. Thus, a series of 9 north-to-south-oriented trenches were excavated,
including 5 trenches in the 0- to 30-ft work zone and 4 trenches in the 30- to 50-ft work zone.
The 5 trenches in the 0- to 30-ft zone measured 30 ft in length, extending the entire width of the
work zone, and were excavated at evenly spaced intervals of about 25 ft. The 4 trenches in the
30- to 50-ft work zone measured 20 ft in length, extending the entire width of the work zone, and
were excavated at regular intervals of about 25 ft between the trenches in the 0- to 30-ft work
zone. Underneath a thin, surficial layer of gravelly construction fill measuring about 20 cm in
thickness, sediments in the eastern portion of the APE consisted of a natural A horizon
underlain by a calcium-carbonate- (CaCO3-) rich B horizon overlying chalky limestone bedrock.
While the modern ground surface had been leveled, presumably when the TPWD facility was
constructed, the native land surface appears to slope gradually downward from east to west
toward Waller Creek, which frames the western property boundary. The trenches were
excavated to the native chalky limestone bedrock, which was encountered in the easternmost
trenches, or deep into the natural B horizon known to overlie bedrock, which grew gradually
deeper progressing westward. The strata observed in all 9 trenches appeared to be entirely
natural under the surficial layer of artificial fill, which was probably deposited to level the land
when the TPWD facility was constructed. No stratigraphic anomalies suggesting the presence
of grave shafts were observed in any of the trench profiles, and no cultural materials of any kind
were encountered during the trench excavations.
The westernmost segment of the APE, extending approximately 250 ft in length
eastward from the western property line, consists of a paved parking lot. Any large-area
scraping operations performed here would necessitate the removal of between 7,500 and
12,500 square ft of asphalt pavement and an unknown volume of artificial fill in order to expose
the native, buried land surface. As this was infeasible given the time constraints available to
perform the fieldwork, it was instead decided to remove the overlying asphalt pavement from
6 large blocks within the 0- to 30-ft work zone and then excavate the artificial fill from within
each block to expose the historic-age land surface. The 6 blocks measured approximately 10 ft
in width (east to west) by 30 ft in length (north to south) and were spaced in leapfrog fashion at
regular intervals within the 0- to 30-ft work zone. In other words, the western edge of the
westernmost block was placed 10 ft east of the western property line, then the western edge of
the second block was placed 10 ft east of the eastern edge of the first block, and so on. Thus,
alternating, 10-ft-wide sections of the 0- to 30-ft work zone were excavated, representing a
sample of 48% of the area. First, the asphalt pavement was removed using the bucket of a
large backhoe. Next, multiple layers of artificial construction fill, presumably deposited when the
TPWD facility was constructed in the 1970s to level the naturally sloping land surface, were
removed. The buried, natural land surface was found to slope downward from east to west
toward Waller Creek. Thus, in the easternmost excavation block, only approximately 10 cm of
artificial fill was found to overlie native soils, whereas 105 cm of artificial fill had to be removed
from the westernmost block. The natural soil horizon under the artificial fill consisted of a dense
B horizon of Houston Black clay. The upper surface of the historic-age land surface was
scraped clean using the bucket of the backhoe and inspected for grave shafts. In addition,

v

Management Summary

12 backhoe trenches were excavated, including 2 trenches within each of the 6 excavation
blocks. Trenches were aligned along the eastern and western edges of each of the excavation
blocks except for the westernmost trench, which was excavated along the northern edge of its
block. Inspection of trench walls suggested that the stratigraphy of the western portion of the
APE was entirely natural and undisturbed (below the thick zone of artificial fill), consisting of
thick beds of black clay overlying pale yellowish-brown, gleyed clay that appeared to have
formed from decomposed limestone bedrock. As no evidence of unmarked graves was
encountered in the 0- to 30-ft work zone, no investigations were conducted in the 30- to 50-ft
work zone due to the time-consuming nature of the asphalt and artificial fill removal and the low
likelihood that the 30- to 50-ft zone would exhibit any marked differences from the 0- to 30-ft
zone. No stratigraphic anomalies suggesting the presence of grave shafts were observed in
any of the trench wall profiles, and no cultural materials of any kind were encountered during the
trench excavations.
The central segment of the APE, measuring approximately 157 ft in length, consisted of
a temporary construction easement owned by the City of Austin that could not be accessed
during the field investigations. The City of Austin was using this portion of the lot to stockpile
gravel, material storage drums, and segments of sewer pipeline being used in construction
projects located elsewhere in north Austin. While this portion of the APE could not be assessed
for its potential to contain unmarked graves associated with the ASH Cemetery across West
51st Street to the north, the absence of any evidence of unmarked grave shafts or historic-age
alteration of buried, soil horizons in the investigated portions of the APE to the east and west
suggests that it is highly unlikely that any unmarked graves exist within the central portion of the
APE.
Finally, Mr. Richard Reneau, the current ASH Cemetery maintenance director, was
contacted by 51st Living regarding the potential for unmarked graves to extend south of West
51st Street. In an email response to 51st Living’s inquiry, Mr. Reneau stated that, while there
are some known unmarked graves along the northern border of the cemetery, the graves
toward the southern end are “well documented and never extended beyond our property lines.”
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources investigations documented in this
report and information provided by the current ASH Cemetery maintenance director, no
unmarked graves associated with the ASH Cemetery located north of West 51st Street appear
to be present south of West 51st Street within the investigated portion of the proposed Waller
Creekside Apartments project area. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a
reasonable and good faith effort to identify unmarked graves within the APE. As no evidence of
unmarked graves was encountered, no further archeological work is recommended in
connection with the proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the proposed project be
cleared to proceed. However, in the event that any human remains, burial furniture, or evidence
of unmarked graves are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or
ongoing maintenance of project facilities, whether in previously surveyed or unsurveyed areas,
all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the find and the THC should be notified of
the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

51st Living, Ltd. (51st Living), is proposing to construct a low-income apartment complex
on the Waller Creekside Apartments tract, an approximately 6.6-acre (ac) tract of land in north
Austin, Travis County, Texas. The Waller Creekside Apartments tract is located off the south
side of West 51st Street between Rowena and Guadalupe streets across the street from the
Austin State Hospital (ASH) Cemetery (Figures 1 to 3).
The project is being sponsored by 51st Living, a private real estate developer, on
privately owned land utilizing funding provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD). As such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended. As the project represents a

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in central Travis County, Texas, near the boundary of
3 significant physiographic provinces—the Blackland Prairie, the Edwards Plateau, and the Gulf
Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie, within which the project area is situated, is a narrow
physiographic zone between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the
east. It is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the
Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of
the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water
often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau
and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to
form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower
plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp
(the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of
this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil,
vegetation, and animal life. The project area is situated on a series of alluvial terraces east of
Waller Creek, a tributary of the Colorado River. Modern-day elevations across the project area
are relatively flat, averaging about 650 ft above mean sea level (amsl). However, the natural
topography within the project area has been substantially altered, presumably during
construction of the now-abandoned TPWD Academy facility on the property in the 1960s or
1970s, by deposition of layers of construction fill laid down to bring the lot to a level grade.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The project area is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age, sedimentary rock
strata. In Travis County, soils formed primarily over sedimentary deposits of Upper Cretaceous
age, and soil parent material consists of chalk, marl, limestone, and marly limestone (Barnes
1974; Werchan et al. 1974). In the central part of Travis County, soils formed over the Upper
Cretaceous Taylor Marl (Knt) and the Austin Chalk (Kau) formations (Barnes 1974). The project
area is located at the interface of these 2 ancient geological formations on fluviatile terrace
deposits deposited during the Late Pleistocene. Late Pleistocene alluvial deposits in Travis
County consist of varying fractions of gravel, sand, silt, and clay, with gravel being more
prominent on the older, higher terraces. The specific fluviatile terrace formation on which the

HJN 110116 AR

7

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

project area is located consists of high-density gravel deposits with an upper cap of silty clay
sediments (Qhg) (Barnes 1974). An important feature of this geologic group and the soils
overlying it is the high shrink-swell potential (Werchan et al. 1974).
Geomorphologically, the project area is situated on the Austin-Eddy Association, which
consists of shallow to moderately deep, calcareous clayey and loamy sediments overlying chalk
(Werchan et al. 1974). Two specific soil units are mapped within the project area (Werchan et
al. 1974). The eastern portion of the APE is characterized as Urban Land, Austin, and
Whitewright soils, 1 to 8% slopes (UtD). The Urban Land component consists of mixed
municipal, commercial, and residential development. The Austin and Whitewright components
consist of residuum weathered from the Austin Chalk Formation and are characterized by
relatively shallow deposits of silty clay and clay loam sediments, respectively, overlying bedrock.
The western portion of the APE is situated on Houston Black soils and Urban Land, 0 to 8%
slopes (HtD). The Houston Black component consists of residuum weathered from calcareous
shale of the Taylor Marl and Eagleford Shale formations. Typical profiles of Houston Black soils
consist of very deep deposits of undifferentiated, dense clay sediments.
Regional climate has a profound effect on the morphology and formation of soil profiles
in Travis County (Werchan et al. 1974). Winter precipitation occurs primarily in the form of
persisting fogs, drizzles, and light showers that contribute to low soil temperature, poor aeration
of soils, and reduction of animal activity and plant growth. Spring rains are generally of short
duration and high intensity, and they tend to retard soil development through erosion. During
hot, dry summers, the clay soils of Travis County crack deeply, and subsequent rains wash the
surface soil into the cracks. This mixing of soils prevents the development of a B horizon in
most places. Rainfall quantities are sufficient to leach the calcium carbonate from the upper
horizons of some soils, but not enough to leach it out entirely. Most of the soils in the county
have specks, threads, or nodules of calcium carbonate throughout the profile. In a few soils,
most of the lime and plant nutrients are leached to a depth below the rooting zone, and clay
particles have moved down to form very slowly permeable horizons.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.

Cultural Resources Investigations on the
Proposed Waller Creekside Apartments Tract, Austin, Travis County, Texas

The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Travis County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to
subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81 cm (32 in) and temperature
averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest month) to
15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods lasting
from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 in), were
followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall
(Baker 1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an
18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge
that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975). Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so
frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture
is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

3.0 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement
of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished.
The Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache Indians were well established in Central Texas by
the 14th century, and Comanche and Kiowa tribes arrived in the area by the 18th century 1. The
first European known to have crossed the region was Domingo Terán de los Ríos, who made an
inspection tour to East Texas in 1691. When the Spanish moved their missions out of East
Texas in 1730, they relocated the missions of San Francisco de los Neches, Nuestra Señora de
la Purísima Concepción de los Hasinai, and San José de los Nazonis to locations near Barton
Springs. In 1827, the Mexican government granted Stephen F. Austin his third colony, Little
Colony, which was located east of the Colorado River and north and west of the Old San
Antonio Road. Mina (later Bastrop) became the headquarters of the colony, and Travis County
developed as an offshoot of Mina. Settlers moving into the area in the early 1830s included
Josiah and Mathias Wilbarger, Reuben Hornsby, Jacob M. Harrell, and John F. Webber. The
onset of the Texas Revolution delayed further settlement activity, and the news of the fall of the
Alamo prompted those settlers already in residence to flee.
Settlement resumed after the revolution, but it proceeded slowly because of the constant
threat of raids by the Comanche Indians. During the 1830s, a chain of small forts extended
from Bastrop northwest along Wilbarger’s Bend, Coleman Branch, Webber’s Prairie, and
Gilleland Creek, to Fort Colorado or Fort Prairie, 8 km (5 miles) east of the site of present-day

Austin. In June 1835, Thomas Jefferson Chambers surveyed part of an 8-league grant covering
the present-day site of Austin and the capitol. Sometime before 1837, William Barton settled
near the springs that were to bear his name. In 1837 or 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar
was on a buffalo hunt in the area and commented on its possibilities as a permanent site for the
capital. In 1838, the community of Waterloo (later Austin) consisted of 4 families, and about
20 families established homes at nearby Montopolis in 1839. When the Congress of the
Republic of Texas chose Waterloo as the site of the new capital, opponents were quick to point
out the disadvantages—the site's proximity to the frontier, the lack of timber, the poor soil, and
the threat of Indian raids. In spite of this opposition, however, the new capital—renamed Austin
in honor of Stephen F. Austin—was approved on 19 January 1840. A few days later, the
Congress established Travis County, naming it in honor of William Barret Travis and making
Austin its county seat. An election for county officials was held in February 1840, at which time
the population was reported to be 856. The initial boundaries of Travis County included roughly
40,000 square miles. Counties that were later carved from Travis County include Callahan
(1858), Coleman (1858), Comal (1846), Gillespie (1848), Hays (1848), Burnet (1852), Brown
(1856), Lampasas (1856), Eastland (1858), Runnels (1858), and Taylor (1858). Sam Houston
moved the government of the Republic of Texas from Austin to Houston when Mexican troops
invaded San Antonio in March 1842. When he tried to have the government archives removed
as well, Austin citizens resisted with the Archives War. The Texas Congress held sessions at
Washington-on-the-Brazos from 1842 to 1845, but the convention that drafted the Constitution
of 1845 met in Austin in July 1845, and by October the rest of the government had returned to
the capital city. The first legislature of the new state convened in Austin in February 1846.
The late 1840s and early 1850s were building years for Austin and Travis County, with
much of the growth fed by the presence of the state government—the Governor's Mansion,
office buildings, hotels, new homes, and newspapers. In 1850, Travis County had a population
of 3,138, of whom 2,336 were white, 791 were slaves, and 11 were free blacks; by 1860, the
number of residents had more than doubled to 8,080, with 4,931 of them white, 3,136 slaves,
and 13 free blacks. Although the city of Austin grew faster than the county as a whole—its
population rose from 629 in 1850 to 3,494 in 1860—most county residents lived in small
communities. Pflugerville and Del Valle were the most prominent of these communities, but
rural post offices were also established at Bluff Springs, Webberville, Merrilltown, Gilleland,
Cage’s Mill, and Hornsby Bend. During the 1850s, the amount of land in farms in what was
then Travis County increased from 73,300 acres to 1,363,500 acres. Corn was the primary field
crop, while cattle and sheep were the principal livestock. In 1860, farmers produced
137,700 bushels of corn and 27,900 bushels of wheat and had 58,000 cattle and 11,800 sheep.
The earliest schools in Travis County were private institutions that usually met in private
homes or in space donated by a church or Masonic lodge. More elaborate private facilities
began to appear by the late 1840s, including Colorado Female College in 1848, Austin Male
and Female Academy in 1849, Austin Female Academy in 1850, and Austin Collegiate Female
Institute in 1852. By 1850, Travis County also had 6 public schools serving a scholastic
population of 183. The county was divided into 19 common school districts in 1852. The state
established the Asylum for the Blind in Austin in 1856 and the Deaf and Dumb School in 1857.
Travis County became a center for higher education in the 1880s with the establishment of the

12

110116_arch_assessment_report

Cultural Resources Investigations on the
Proposed Waller Creekside Apartments Tract, Austin, Travis County, Texas

University of Texas in 1881, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute in 1881, and Saint
Edward's University in 1885. Samuel Huston College began holding classes in the 1890s. The
Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary opened in 1902, Texas Wesleyan College Academy
in 1912, Concordia Lutheran College in 1926, and the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the
Southwest in 1952. Austin Community College began operations in 1972. The availability of
schools resulted in a high level of education for a large portion of the county’s population. In the
1940s, while more rural areas of the state reported that less than 10% of their population over
the age of 25 had high school diplomas, nearly 20% of Travis County residents had graduated.
By 1980, that number had jumped to 75%.
The earliest churches in Travis County were the Catholic missions relocated to the area
by the Spanish in 1730, but these were moved to San Antonio in 1731, and it was more than a
century before any organized religious practices were firmly established. In the 1830s, a variety
of religious groups began to appear—Methodist circuit riders held services along Gilleland
Creek in 1837 or 1838; Presbyterians organized a church in Austin in October 1839; Mormons
settled near Fort Coleman, Webberville, and Hornsby Bend in the late 1830s; and Catholic
priests, among them Jean Marie Odin, returned to the area in 1840. A Baptist church and a
Church of Christ were organized in Austin in 1847, a Lutheran church was established in New
Sweden and a Jewish synagogue in Austin began in 1876, and a Christian Science church
formed in Austin in 1889. In the early 1980s, Travis County’s 266 churches had an estimated
combined membership of 194,194; Catholic, Southern Baptist, and United Methodist were the
largest denominations.
In spite of the rapid growth that Travis County experienced during the 1850s, the area
was at that time still very much at the edge of the frontier. The absence of railroads meant that
goods had to be shipped by wagon to and from Houston and Port Lavaca, and poor roads
meant that goods sometimes could not be shipped at all. In 1852, the Austin Railroad
Association was established to encourage railroad construction to the area, and considerable
progress had been made by the late 1850s; however, the Civil War intervened, and work on
railroad acquisition was postponed. The Secession Convention convened in Austin on
28 January 1861. Although a group of Austin citizens staged a demonstration in favor of
secession, Unionist sentiment was high, and Travis County residents voted against secession,
704 to 450. Nevertheless, when the Civil War began, Travis County provided several hundred
volunteers, among them the Travis Rifles, the Tom Green Rifles, the Capitol Guard, and the
Austin City Light Infantry. In the 2 months between the end of the war and the arrival of federal
troops in the county, looting of farms and businesses was common. Although the inevitable
clashes between the Unionist forces and the former rebels resulted in the arrest of as many as
30 people per day, the presence of federal troops served to curb much of the lawlessness. By
early 1866, most of the federal soldiers had been mustered out of service, leaving only about
200 men to police the Austin area until the end of the military occupation in 1870. Austin was
the site of the constitutional conventions of 1866 and 1868-69 and witnessed both the removal
of Governor James W. Throckmorton in 1867 and the Coke-Davis Controversy in 1874. In the
gubernatorial election of 1869, Travis County residents favored Andrew J. Hamilton to Edmund
J. Davis by a margin of 798 to 593.

Chapter 3.0: Historical Background

Like most areas in the South, Travis County suffered considerable economic hardship
immediately after the Civil War and throughout the Reconstruction period. Between 1864 and
1866, the county as a whole experienced a 49% loss in property tax receipts. Roughly twothirds of this property loss was in slaves, with the rest coming from declines in farm and
livestock values, each of which fell 25 to 40%. The county began to show signs of recovery by
1880. The overall population rose from 13,153 in 1870 to 27,028 in 1880, and the 1880 census
reported 1,912 farms, an increase of 656 over the 1870 totals. The amount of improved land
rose from 83,200 acres in 1870 to 139,800 in 1880. Field crops such as corn, cotton, wheat,
and oats took up nearly half of the improved farmland, while livestock dominated the rest.
Economic recovery was facilitated by the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central
Railway, which completed its track to Austin in 1871, and the International and Great Northern
Railroad, which was built between Rockdale and Austin in 1876 and completed from Austin to
Laredo in 1881. The Austin and Northwestern Railroad laid track between Austin and Burnet in
1882, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas line arrived in 1904. Communities besides Austin
that benefited directly from easy railroad access included Pflugerville, Manor, Oak Hill, and
Manchaca. After the war, many former slaves remained in the area. In the year after the war,
the black population increased by 60%, while the white population rose by only 12%. By 1870,
black residents numbered 4,647, comprising 35% of the county's total population. Clarksville,
Kincheonville, Masontown, and Wheatville were among the communities established by former
slaves. The number of black residents in Travis County continued to increase steadily, reaching
13,299 in 1900. It fluctuated between 13,000 and 15,000 from 1900 to 1930, but increased
rapidly thereafter, rising to 22,493 in 1950, 32,270 in 1970, and 63,173 in 1990. Because other
segments of the population grew at an even faster rate, the percentage of black residents, with
respect to the total population, declined significantly, falling to 20% by 1930 and 11% by 1990.
Contributing to the shift in the ethnic makeup of the county was a variety of immigrant groups,
the most prominent of which were German, Swedish, and Mexican. By the turn of the century,
8% of the population was composed of natives of 1 of these countries. Although the early
Swedish and German settlers contributed to the diversity of Travis County through their religious
and educational institutions, the Mexican influence was also reinforced by the continued arrival
of large numbers of new immigrants fleeing the unrest of the Mexican Revolution in the early
20th century. The 1930 census reported that 10,225 residents, or 13% of the county’s total
population, were of Hispanic descent; by 1990, the number of Hispanic residents had risen to
121,689, or 21%.
In 1890, Travis County had 36,322 residents. Of these, 14,575 lived in Austin, which
was fast outgrowing its efforts to become a modern city. Innovations and improvements in
progress at that time included a trolley system and water-generated electricity, but most of its
streets remained unpaved. By the turn of the century several hundred assorted businesses
filled the needs of the 22,000 Austin residents. Yet, in spite of this rapid increase in Austin’s
population, the majority of the county’s residents lived on farms or in smaller towns, and
agriculture dominated the area economy. Cotton became the principal field crop in the late
1880s and remained so for more than 60 years. The 1890 census reported 65,000 acres—
nearly 30% of the county's improved farmland—planted in cotton; by the turn of the century, the
amount of land devoted to cotton had increased to 113,300 acres, or 56% of the improved

14

110116_arch_assessment_report

Cultural Resources Investigations on the
Proposed Waller Creekside Apartments Tract, Austin, Travis County, Texas

farmland. However, as more marginal land was used and the soil became depleted, production
levels fell; in 1930, 143,000 acres produced only 19,000 bales. By the late 1950s, cotton
accounted for only 26% of the total cropland harvested, and by 1980 it had fallen to only 8%.
Farm tenancy had increased steadily since the 1890s and peaked in 1930, with tenants
operating two-thirds of the 3,642 farms. The number of farms fell by more than 1,000 in the
1930s, as many tenant farmers either moved away or turned to other occupations. Farmers
who remained in the area began to devote more of their resources to crops other than cotton
and to livestock. The number of cattle increased from 32,000 in 1920 and to 51,000 in 1950;
the number of sheep and goats increased as well, boosting wool and mohair production from
23,600 and 4,292 pounds, respectively, in 1920, and to 127,800 and 183,600 pounds in 1959.
By the late 1960s, hay and sorghum combined to account for 60% of the cropland harvested.
The Great Depression was slow to hit Travis County, but, by the mid-1930s, many
people were unemployed and very glad of the New Deal programs that resulted in work paving
streets; building bridges, sewers, and parks; and constructing the tower of the University of
Texas campus. In part because of the job opportunities made available through relief projects,
state government, and the university community, the population increased by 43% in the 1930s,
rising from 77,777 in 1930 to 111,053 in 1940. One major job-producing project in the 1930s
was the construction of a series of dams on the Colorado River. Austin and Travis County had
begun efforts to tame the Colorado as early as 1869, when the army built a pontoon bridge
across the river. In 1893, the City of Austin completed a dam designed to provide power for its
water and electrical systems. By 1899, the city was already experiencing power shortfalls, and
a major flood in 1900 destroyed the dam. Another flood in 1915 washed out the repairs that
were underway, and the project was abandoned. The flood of 1935 put much of downtown
Austin under water, and the area’s interest in a lasting flood-control system was renewed. The
Lower Colorado River Authority was established and a series of dams was built, forming Lake
Austin, Lake Travis, Lake Buchanan, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, Inks Lake, and Lake Marble
Falls. Travis County also profited from the establishment of several military bases. Camp
Mabry in northwest Austin, established as the main Texas National Guard facility in 1890,
served as an army training center during World War I. After the US became involved in World
War II, the Del Valle Army Air Base, soon renamed Bergstrom Army Air Field, was established
in southeast Travis County. After the war was over, the presence of military personnel
continued to bring changes to the county. Thousands of returning veterans enrolled in the local
colleges and universities, greatly increasing the student population as well as intensifying the
demand for housing and the growth of service industries.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Travis County underwent 2 significant developments. The first
of these was desegregation. The Sweatt v. Painter decision in 1950 pushed the University of
Texas to the forefront in the fight for civil rights, leading it to become the first southern university
to admit blacks as undergraduates, although it was not until 1962 that all of the university’s
facilities were fully integrated. Public schools in Travis County began to follow suit in 1955.
Local Mexican-American organizations also achieved a measure of success against
discriminatory practices. Some local businesses resisted these changes, prompting strikes and
protests in the 1960s, but in the end desegregation was accomplished without the violence
prevalent in other urban areas of the country. The change became even more visible as blacks

Chapter 3.0: Historical Background

and Hispanics were elected to public office—Wilhelmina Delco to the school board in 1968 and
to the Texas House of Representatives in 1976; Berl Handcox to the Austin city council in 1971;
Richard Moya to the Travis County commissioner’s court in 1970; and Gonzalo Barrientos to the
Texas House of Representatives in 1974.
The second major development was the
establishment of several high-tech industries. In 1951, a small, local company became Texas
Instruments, and in 1955 Tracor, Incorporated, made Austin its base of operations.
International Business Machines opened an Austin branch in 1967, followed by Motorola in
1974. These companies, along with Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation
(1983), Dell Computers (1984), and Sematech (1988), became the county’s largest employers.
From the end of Reconstruction to the present, most Travis County residents chose to
support Democratic presidential candidates, with exceptions in 1896, 1928, 1952, 1956, 1972,
and 1984. Occasionally, a third-party candidate drew a sizable portion of the vote, but only 3 of
them—the Greenback-Labor candidate in 1880, George Wallace in 1968, and John Anderson in
1984—garnered sufficient support to affect the county’s overall election results. In state
elections, Travis County residents were staunchly Democratic. In the early 1980s, 63% of the
land in Travis County was devoted to farms and ranches. About 23% of the farmland was under
cultivation, with sorghum, hay, wheat, and cotton accounting for nearly 70% of the 94,000 acres
harvested; other crops included potatoes, sweet potatoes, peaches, and pecans. Sixty-six
percent of the county’s $32 million in agricultural receipts came from livestock and livestock
products, the most important ones being cattle, milk, sheep, wool, and hogs. Although
agriculture remained an important aspect of the local economy, farm receipts were greatly
surpassed by the income generated by non-agricultural industries. Professional and related
services, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and government administration involved
70% of the work force in the 1980s; of the rest, 7% were self-employed and 3% employed
outside the county. Since shortly after the turn of the century, the majority of Travis County
residents had resided in the City of Austin. The jobs made available by the growth of the hightech industries reinforced that trend, and, by 1970, 85% of the 295,516 residents lived in the
capital city. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, residential development near Lake Travis
encouraged many people to move away from the city, and although Austin continued to grow at
a rapid pace, the number of residents choosing to live near the lake and in northern and
southern suburbs increased at an even faster rate. By 1990, Lago Vista (2,199), Jonestown
(1,250), Briarcliff (335), Lakeway (4,044), and Pflugerville (4,444) in Travis County, as well as
Round Rock and even Georgetown in Williamson County, had become popular alternatives to
living in Austin. Like the rest of Texas, Travis County weathered a serious economic downturn
in the mid-1980s; newly-built office space sat empty, and many people lost their jobs. Added to
this was news that Bergstrom Air Force Base was scheduled to close. In the early 1990s,
however, plans were underway to convert the Bergstrom site into a new municipal airport, and
the county was looking forward to a period of growth. The population of Travis County was
reported at 576,407 in 1990, an increase of 37% from 1980. Among the area’s most prevalent
concerns was that future growth should not destroy the ecological balance of environmentally
sensitive areas in the western hills.

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The mechanical scraping operations described in this report were undertaken with
2 primary research goals in mind:
1. To determine whether or not unmarked graves associated with the ASH Cemetery
occur within the designated project area
2. To make recommendations for the treatment of any unmarked graves in the
designated project area based on provisions of the NHPA and the Texas Health and
Safety Code
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of background archival research, a
program of mechanical scraping and trenching within the portion of the project area located in
closest proximity to the current boundaries of the ASH Cemetery, and a brief informant interview
with the current maintenance director of the ASH Cemetery. The rest of this chapter presents
the results of background archival research and the investigative methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

The ASH was established as the Texas State Lunatic Asylum by act of the Sixth Texas
Legislature in 1856 and began operation in May 1861 with 12 patients. 2 It is the oldest hospital
in Texas for the care and treatment of the mentally ill. Initially, asylums in Texas were operated
under individual boards of 5 members, appointed by the governor, with each board developing
its own standards. In 1913, the legislature placed its mental hospitals under individual boards of
managers. In January 1920, state hospitals were placed under the Board of Control. The name
of the Austin asylum was changed to ASH in 1925. In 1949, control of the hospital was
transferred to the Board for Texas State Hospitals and Special Schools. In 1993, it was
operated by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation.
In 1942, a state dairy and hog farm was established on 308 acres owned by the state,
17 miles from Austin, to provide milk and meat for Texas mental institutions. An additional
1,140 acres was leased. The ASH had from 25 to 30 patients stationed at the farm in 1945.
That year, the hospital had 2,810 beds, 2,774 patients, and 360 nonmedical staff employees,

and the medical staff consisted of the superintendent, assistant superintendent, 9 assistant
physicians, and a dentist. In 1940, the hospital was designated an independent school district
and began providing education for school-age psychiatric patients. By 1961, it had a rated
capacity of 2,608 patients, and service had been expanded by outreach clinics and follow-up
services for furloughed and discharged patients. In 1964, it expanded, within its own grounds, to
incorporate patients from the Texas Confederate Home.
The ASH had an average daily population in 1968 of 3,313, and 900 elderly patients
were maintained on furlough in private facilities. The institution provided surgical services for
residents and for persons from the Austin State School, the Travis State School, and the Texas
Confederate Home (before it was closed in 1967). An adult out-patient clinic was operated by
the hospital, with referrals to the Travis County Mental Health and Mental Retardation Clinic and
to various county community health centers around the state. Admissions of younger patients,
alcoholic patients, and drug abusers increased in 1970, and the average daily census was
1,994. By 1986–87, with changes in the philosophy of treatment, there was an average of only
711 inmates, while the Austin MHMR center served 7,100. By 1992–93, inmates had
decreased to 450, and the MHMR center served 9,000. In 1990, the hospital served
34 counties in Central Texas with an annual admittance of 3,500 patients but a daily average of
only 518. In 1990, renovation was begun on the original administration building, the third oldest
state building in Texas. It was expected to take from 4 to 6 years and to cost $4 million.
The ASH is located at 4110 Guadalupe Street, approximately 1.0 mile southwest of the
current location of the ASH Cemetery and the Waller Creekside Apartments project area.
Established in 1856 by an act of the Texas Legislature, the state purchased 380 acres of land
for the Texas State Lunatic Asylum early in 1857 located 2 miles north of the capitol building
from William Fields of Galveston for the sum of $2,500. The native Tonkawa, Lipan Apache,
and Comanche, who had formerly camped at the site, moved west shortly after construction of
the new asylum began, though a few remained in the vicinity and hired themselves out as day
laborers to help dig the steam tunnels (Sitton 1999).
The original asylum’s cemetery grounds were located in front of the main building (now
the Administration Building) at 4110 Guadalupe Street, now the location of a water fountain and
grassy walkway adjacent to the south side of the parking lot for the Administration Building. The
first patient was buried there after the asylum became operational in May 1861 (Davis 2001).
The asylum’s administration established the current cemetery when they decided to expand
their facilities and build over most of the original graveyard.
The location of the old cemetery was extremely objectionable, on account of its being
almost in the midst of the park, and immediately in front of the buildings. Its removal was
an enterprise much dreaded, but was accomplished without detriment or injury to the life
or health of any one (Brightman 1971).

The removal of the old graveyard began in November 1883 and was completed in about
4 weeks. A new cemetery was established about a mile northeast of the asylum in the
northeast corner of a tract of land purchased from Brueggerhoff (Davis 2001). Based on the
reports of the early superintendents of the asylum, which contained statistical data reported to

18

110116_arch_assessment_report

Cultural Resources Investigations on the
Proposed Waller Creekside Apartments Tract, Austin, Travis County, Texas

the governor, approximately 305 patients had died at asylum between 1861 and 1883 by the
time the old cemetery was moved to its current location between what are now West 51st and
West 53rd streets. No statistics of deaths before 1866 have been found; however, the 1884
superintendent’s report reveals that 305 deaths had occurred “from beginning” through 1883;
though the number of these patients buried in the old cemetery is unknown (Davis 2001).
Between 1861 and 1883, a total of 1,980 patients were admitted from 76 counties in Texas.
Beginning approximately 10 ago, ASH staff have combed through existing cemetery
records in an attempt to construct a master list of individuals buried in the cemetery and map
the distribution of plots. According to former maintenance supervisor J. Williamson:
For those bodies that did certainly make the transition [from the old cemetery location to
the current cemetery], each was said to have been wrapped and buried in a shroud, and
their graves marked with a wooden stick inscribed with their patient identification number.
If those sticks ever existed, they have long since rotted away (Smith 2005).

Cemetery data compiled by Superintendent Carl Schock and former ASH Cemetery
Maintenance Director Dave Rupe suggest that the number of patients moved from the original
graveyard is unknown as the actual records have been lost (Davis 2001). The earliest available
record in the plot data that have been compiled by ASH staff list the first interment in the new
cemetery in Plot No. 1 as being T.J. Flournoy of Gonzales County, admitted to the asylum on
October 28, 1883, and dying on January 1, 1884 (Davis 2001). A cemetery plot map compiled
by ASH staff shows about 2,640 plots with about 762 graves listed as unknown, not counting
the unmarked graves from the original graveyard (estimates range from as few as 60 to as
many as 305). The current cemetery contains about 24 headstones dating between 1883 and
1930, and an additional 13 burials within the past 2 decades have identification data on the
tombstones. However, most of the graves in the cemetery are marked with small, rectangular
cement blocks set flush with the ground that are imprinted only with the patient’s identification
number. Some of the names found in ASH ledgers were specifically listed as having been
buried in the cemetery but were listed as unknown on the plot data. Among the more prominent
individuals known to be buried in the cemetery are Civil War veterans; possibly widows of Civil
War soldiers; John Neely Bryan, the founder of the City of Dallas; a veteran of the US
25th Infantry Regiment (a “Buffalo Soldier”); and a “Toby” Jackson who witnessed his pioneer
family killed by Indians as a child (Davis 2001). However, the identities of most of the
individuals buried in the cemetery remain unknown. Overall, the cemetery is believed to contain
as many as 3,000 graves, including an estimated 700 burials that are not accounted for in the
ASH’s cemetery log (Smith 2005).

REGULATORY BACKGROUND

51st Living is proposing to construct a low-income apartment complex on the Waller
Creekside Apartments tract, an approximately 6.6-ac tract of land in north Austin, Travis County,
Texas. The project is being sponsored by 51st Living, a private real estate developer, on
privately owned land utilizing funding provided by HUD. As such, the project falls under the
jurisdiction of Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. As the project represents a
publicly sponsored undertaking with the potential to impact significant cultural resources,

HJN 110116 AR

19

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

51st Living was required to provide for a cultural resources assessment of the project’s APE to
assess the project’s possible impacts on any significant cultural resources in the APE.
Preliminary consultation undertaken with the THC resulted in the determination that the
project area did not need to be surveyed for cultural resources in its entirety. However, as the
proposed project area is located immediately across West 51st Street from the historic-age ASH
Cemetery, the THC believed that the northernmost portion of the tract that abuts West
51st Street had a relatively high potential to contain unmarked graves associated with the ASH
Cemetery to the north. As such, the THC required that mechanical scraping be conducted
along the northern edge of the tract that abuts West 51st Street to assess the potential for
unmarked graves within the project area. The THC stipulated that mechanical scraping
operations should extend at least 30 to 50 ft back from the northern property line abutting West
51st Street to assess whether or not any unmarked graves exist within this portion of the
property. In the event that any unmarked graves were found to exist within the Waller
Creekside Apartments property, provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code (Chapter 711)
would additionally apply to the project, and mechanical scraping would need to be extended
farther south until the maximum extent of the cemetery within the property’s boundaries could
be determined. Any decisions made regarding unmarked graves on the Waller Creekside
Apartments tract or the potential exhumation of graves would fall under the jurisdiction of both
the Texas Health and Safety Code and the NHPA and would require coordination with the THC.
Thus, the APE of the proposed undertaking was defined as a work zone extending a minimum
of 30 to 50 ft back from the northern property line, which measures approximately 515 ft in
length along the south side of West 51st Street.
To meet its responsibilities under applicable federal and state laws, 51st Living
contracted with Horizon to obtain all necessary clearances for cultural resources. From
September 26 to 30, 2011, Horizon archeologists conducted mechanical operations along the
northern edge of the Waller Creekside Apartments tract to assess the potential for unmarked
graves associated with the historic-age ASH Cemetery to exist within the property’s boundaries.
Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, supervised the field investigations and monitored
mechanical scraping and trenching operations; Michael Mudd, archeological field technician,
assisted with monitoring the excavations; and Jared Wiersema and Chris Carrell operated the
machinery.

FIELD INVESTIGATIVE METHODS

51st Living is proposing to construct a low-income apartment complex on the Waller
Creekside Apartments tract, an approximately 6.6-ac tract of land in north Austin, Travis County,
Texas. The Waller Creekside Apartments tract is located off the south side of West 51st Street
between Rowena and Guadalupe streets across the street from the ASH Cemetery (Figures 4
and 5; also see Figures 1 to 3). The proposed Waller Creek Apartments tract represents the
former site of the TPWD Academy training facility and consists of a mix of open, grassy fields;
paved parking lots and driveways; and abandoned brick buildings that appear to have been
constructed in the 1960s or 1970s (Figure 6; also see Figure 3).

Figure 6. Abandoned TPWD Training Facility South of Eastern Work Zone (Facing S)

Initially, the proposed methodology for the mechanical operations consisted of scraping
off the modern ground surface and any underlying layers of artificial fill to expose the original
19th-century ground surface so that the natural, historic-age ground surface could be inspected
for grave shafts within a 30- to 50-foot-wide strip along the northern edge of the property. In
addition to the scraping operations, backhoe trenches were to be excavated at approximately
50-foot intervals along this strip to a sufficient depth to determine whether or not the exposed
soils were, in fact, natural and therefore conducive to identifying intrusive grave shafts. Upon
initiating the fieldwork, it immediately became apparent that this methodology would not be
practicable due to several constraining factors, and the methodology had to be adjusted several
times during the week of fieldwork. THC staff members visited the project area on 3 separate
occasions while fieldwork was being conducted. Mark Denton, coordinator of the State and
Federal Review Section of the Archeology Division, visited the site all 3 times; Anne Shelton,
cemetery preservation coordinator, visited twice; and Brad Jones and Pat Mercado-Allinger
each visited once. THC personnel were able to inspect mechanical operations as they were in
progress and after they were completed, and the necessary changes to the field methodology
were developed in consultation with THC staff, primarily Mark Denton, while they were on-site.
The northern boundary of the tract abutting West 51st Street measures approximately
515 ft in length. The easternmost segment of the APE, extending approximately 108 ft in length
westward from the eastern property line, consists of an open grassy field (Figure 7). Initially,
scraping operations commenced by removing long, continuous strips of overburden with the

blade of a small trackhoe (Figure 8). However, it was immediately discovered that the ground
was so dry and sediments were so compact as the result of a year-long drought that continuous
scraping operations would not be feasible as it simply was not possible to dislodge sediments
below a depth of about 10 centimeters (cm) below surface.
Inspection of the alignment of tombstones in the southeastern portion of the ASH
Cemetery, located immediately north of West 51st Street across from the eastern portion of the
APE, suggested that the rows of graves extend along a roughly northeast-to-southwest axis,
following the current eastern property line of the cemetery (Figure 9). It was anticipated that a
“checkerboard” pattern of trenches, excavated along a more or less north-to-south orientation,
would cut across any rows of burials that may extend into the APE, thereby providing an
opportunity to identify any grave shafts in trench wall profiles. Thus, a series of 9 north-tosouth-oriented trenches were excavated, including 5 trenches in the 0- to 30-ft work zone and
4 trenches in the 30- to 50-ft work zone (Figures 10 to 13). The 5 trenches in the 0- to 30-ft
zone (BTs E1 to E5) measured 30 ft in length, extending the entire width of the work zone, and
were excavated at evenly spaced intervals of about 25 ft. The 4 trenches in the 30- to 50-ft
work zone (BTs E6 to E9) measured 20 ft in length, extending the entire width of the work zone,
and were excavated at regular intervals of about 25 ft between the trenches in the 0- to 30-ft
work zone.
Underneath a thin, surficial layer of gravelly construction fill measuring about 20 cm in
thickness, sediments in the eastern portion of the APE consisted of a natural A horizon

underlain by a calcium-carbonate- (CaCO3-) rich B horizon overlying chalky limestone bedrock
(Figure 14; Appendix A). While the modern ground surface had been leveled, presumably when
the TPWD facility was constructed, the native land surface slopes gradually downward from
east to west toward Waller Creek, which frames the western property boundary. The trenches
were excavated to the native chalky limestone bedrock, which was encountered in the
3 easternmost trenches (BT E5 and BT E9) at depths of 80 and 110 cmbs, respectively, or deep
into the natural B horizon known to overlie bedrock, which grew gradually deeper progressing
westward. The strata observed in all 9 trenches appeared to be entirely natural under the
surficial layer of artificial fill, which was probably deposited to level the land when the TPWD
facility was constructed. No stratigraphic anomalies suggesting the presence of grave shafts
were observed in any of the trench profiles, and no cultural materials of any kind were
encountered during the trench excavations.
The westernmost segment of the APE, measuring approximately 250 ft in length
extending eastward from the western property line, consists of a paved parking lot (Figure 15;
also see Figure 3). Any large-area scraping operations performed here would necessitate the
removal of between 7,500 and 12,500 sq ft of asphalt pavement and an unknown volume of
artificial fill in order to expose the native, buried land surface. As this was not feasible given the
time constraints available to perform the fieldwork, it was instead decided to remove the
overlying asphalt pavement from 6 large blocks within the 0- to 30-ft work zone and then
excavate the artificial fill from within each block to expose the historic-age land surface
(Figure 16). The 6 blocks measured approximately 10 ft in width (east to west) by 30 ft in length

(north to south) and were spaced in leapfrog fashion at regular intervals within the 0- to 30-ft
work zone (Figure 17). In other words, the western edge of the westernmost block was placed
10 ft east of the western property line, then the western edge of the second block was placed
10 ft east of the eastern edge of the first block, and so on. Thus, alternating, 10-ft-wide sections
of the 0- to 30-ft work zone (designated as Blocks A to F) were excavated, representing a
sample of 48% of the area (Figure 18). First, the asphalt pavement was removed using the
bucket of a large backhoe. Next, multiple layers of artificial construction fill, presumably
deposited when the TPWD facility was constructed in the 1970s to level the naturally sloping
land surface, were removed. Following removal of construction fill from the 6 excavation blocks,
the surface of the native, buried land surface was scraped clean with the backhoe bucket and
examined for evidence of grave shafts.
In addition, 12 backhoe trenches were excavated during investigations in the western
portion of the APE, including 2 trenches within each of the 6 excavation blocks (Figure 19; also
see Figure 17). Trenches were aligned along the eastern and western edges of each of the
excavation blocks except for the westernmost trench, which was excavated along the northern
edge of the block. Inspection of trench walls suggested that the buried, natural land surface
was found to slope downward from east to west toward Waller Creek. In easternmost
excavation block, only approximately 10 cm of artificial fill was found to overlie native soils,
whereas 105 cm of artificial fill had to be removed from the westernmost block (Figure 20). The
natural soil horizon under the artificial fill consisted of a dense B horizon of Houston Black clay
(Figure 21).

Like the soil strata observed in the eastern portion of the APE, the stratigraphy observed
in the western portion of the APE appeared to be entirely natural and undisturbed (below the
thick zone of artificial fill), consisting of thick beds of black clay overlying pale yellowish-brown,
gleyed clay that appeared to have formed from decomposed limestone bedrock. As no
evidence of unmarked graves was encountered in the 0- to 30-ft work zone, no investigations
were conducted in the 30- to 50-ft work zone due to the time-consuming nature of the asphalt
and artificial fill removal and the low likelihood that the 30- to 50-ft zone would exhibit any
marked differences from the 0- to 30-ft zone. No stratigraphic anomalies suggesting the
presence of grave shafts were observed in any of the trench wall profiles, and no cultural
materials of any kind were encountered during the trench excavations.
The central segment of the APE, measuring approximately 157 ft in length, consisted of
a temporary construction easement owned by the City of Austin that could not be accessed
during the field investigations (Figure 22 to 23). The City of Austin was using this portion of the
lot to stockpile gravel, material storage drums, and segments of sewer pipeline being used in
construction projects located elsewhere in north Austin. While this portion of the APE could not
be assessed for its potential to contain unmarked graves associated with the ASH Cemetery
across West 51st Street to the north, the absence of any evidence of unmarked grave shafts or
historic-age alternation of buried, historic-age soil horizons in the investigated portions of the
APE to the east and west suggests that it is highly unlikely that any unmarked graves exist
within the central portion of the APE.

Finally, Mr. Richard Reneau, the current ASH Cemetery maintenance director, was
contacted by 51st Living regarding the potential for unmarked graves to extend south of West
51st Street. In an email response to 51st Living’s inquiry about the potential for unmarked
graves on the Waller Creekside Apartments tract, dated July 27, 2011, Mr. Reneau stated:
Our graves are not unmarked, each known grave has a 4 digit numeral assigned to it.
There are some graves of unknowns, but they are on the north border of the [ASH
Cemetery] property. The graves nearest your land are well documented and never
extended beyond our property lines.

Thus, according to Mr. Reneau, while there are some known unmarked graves along the
northern border of the cemetery, the graves toward the southern end are believed not to extend
beyond the current cemetery boundaries.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

51st Living is proposing to construct a low-income apartment complex on the Waller
Creekside Apartments tract, an approximately 6.6-ac tract of land in north Austin, Travis County,
Texas. The Waller Creekside Apartments tract is located off the south side of West 51st Street
between Rowena and Guadalupe streets across the street from the ASH Cemetery.
The project is being sponsored by 51st Living, a private real estate developer, on
privately owned land utilizing funding provided by HUD. As such, the project falls under the
jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as
amended. As the project represents a publicly sponsored undertaking with the potential to
impact significant cultural resources, 51st Living was required to provide for a cultural resources
assessment of the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE) to assess the project’s possible
impacts on any significant cultural resources in the APE.
Preliminary consultation undertaken with the THC resulted in the determination that the
project area did not need to be surveyed for cultural resources in its entirety. However, as the
proposed project area is located immediately across West 51st Street from the historic-age ASH
Cemetery, the THC believed that the northernmost portion of the tract that abuts West
51st Street had a relatively high potential to contain unmarked graves associated with the ASH
Cemetery to the north. As such, the THC required that mechanical scraping be conducted
along the northern edge of the tract that abuts West 51st Street to assess the potential for
unmarked graves within the project area. The THC stipulated that mechanical scraping
operations should extend at least 30 to 50 ft back from the northern property line abutting West
51st Street to assess whether or not any unmarked graves exist within this portion of the
property. In the event that any unmarked graves were found to exist within the Waller
Creekside Apartments property, provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code (Chapter 711)
would additionally apply to the project, and mechanical scraping would need to be extended
farther south until the maximum extent of the cemetery within the property’s boundaries could
be determined. Any decisions made regarding unmarked graves on the Waller Creekside
Apartments tract or the potential exhumation of graves would fall under the jurisdiction of both
the Texas Health and Safety Code and the NHPA and would require coordination with the THC.
Thus, the APE of the proposed undertaking was defined as a work zone extending a minimum
of 30 to 50 ft back from the northern property line, which measures approximately 515 ft in
length along the south side of West 51st Street.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

To meet its responsibilities under applicable federal and state laws, 51st Living
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to obtain all necessary
clearances for cultural resources. From September 26 to 30, 2011, Horizon archeologists
conducted mechanical operations along the northern edge of the Waller Creekside Apartments
tract to assess the potential for unmarked graves associated with the historic-age ASH
Cemetery to exist within the property’s boundaries. Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator,
supervised the field investigations and monitored mechanical scraping and trenching
operations; Michael Mudd, archeological field technician, assisted with monitoring the
excavations; and Jared Wiersema and Chris Carrell operated the machinery.
No evidence of unmarked graves or historic-age cultural materials of any kind was
encountered in the APE as a result of the program of mechanical scraping and trenching. The
eastern segment of the APE consists of a grassy field that had been minimally impacted during
prior construction of the TPWD Academy facility on the property. Sediments in the eastern
portion of the APE consisted of a thin, surficial layer of construction debris underlain by
moderately deep deposits of clay loam with abundant CaCO3 inclusions overlying chalky
bedrock. The western segment of the APE consists of an asphalt-paved parking lot underlain
by thick deposits of artificial fill that were laid down to bring the naturally sloping landscape
within the project area to a level grade. Underneath the thick section of artificial fill, sediments
in the western portion of the APE consisted of thick beds of Houston Black clay overlying gleyed
clay deposits that appear to have weathered from decomposing limestone or chalk bedrock.
Below the disturbed upper stratigraphic horizons composed of artificial fill, sediments observed
in both sides of the APE appeared to be entirely natural and undisturbed.
The central portion of the APE could not be accessed during the field investigations as
the City of Austin was using it as a temporary construction materials staging area. However,
based on the absence of any evidence of unmarked grave shafts or historic-age alternation of
buried, historic-age soil horizons in the investigated portions of the APE to the east and west, it
is highly unlikely that any unmarked graves exist within the central portion of the APE.
In addition to the program of mechanical scraping and trenching, Mr. Richard Reneau,
the current ASH Cemetery maintenance director, was contacted by 51st Living regarding the
potential for unmarked graves to extend south of West 51st Street. In an email response to
51st Living’s inquiry, Mr. Reneau stated that, while there are some known unmarked graves
along the northern border of the cemetery, the graves toward the southern end are “well
documented and never extended beyond our property lines.”

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The mechanical scraping operations described in this report were undertaken with
2 primary research goals in mind:
1. To determine whether or not unmarked graves associated with the ASH Cemetery
occur within the designated project area
2. To make recommendations for the treatment of any unmarked graves within the
designated project area based on provisions of the NHPA and the Texas Health and
Safety Code
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of background archival research, a
program of mechanical scraping and trenching within the portion of the project area located in
closest proximity to the current boundaries of the ASH Cemetery, and a brief informant interview
with the current maintenance director of the ASH Cemetery.

6.2

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

No evidence of unmarked graves or historic-age cultural materials of any kind was
encountered in the APE as a result of the program of mechanical scraping and trenching. The
eastern segment of the APE consists of a grassy field that had been minimally impacted during
prior construction of the TPWD Academy facility on the property. Sediments in the eastern
portion of the APE consisted of a thin, surficial layer of construction debris underlain by
moderately deep deposits of clay loam with abundant CaCO3 inclusions overlying chalky
bedrock. The western segment of the APE consists of an asphalt-paved parking lot underlain
by thick deposits of artificial fill that were laid down to bring the naturally sloping landscape
within the project area to a level grade. Underneath the thick section of artificial fill, sediments
in the western portion of the APE consisted of thick beds of Houston Black clay overlying gleyed
clay deposits that appear to have weathered from decomposing limestone or chalk bedrock.
Below the disturbed upper stratigraphic horizons composed of artificial fill, sediments observed
in both sides of the APE appeared to be entirely natural and undisturbed.
The central portion of the APE could not be accessed during the field investigations as
the City of Austin was using it as a temporary construction materials staging area. However,

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

based on the absence of any evidence of unmarked grave shafts or historic-age alternation of
buried, historic-age soil horizons in the investigated portions of the APE to the east and west, it
is highly unlikely that any unmarked graves exist within the central portion of the APE.
In addition to the program of mechanical scraping and trenching, Mr. Richard Reneau,
the current ASH Cemetery maintenance director, was contacted by 51st Living regarding the
potential for unmarked graves to extend south of West 51st Street. In an email response to
51st Living’s inquiry, Mr. Reneau stated that, while there are some known unmarked graves
along the northern border of the cemetery, the graves toward the southern end are “well
documented and never extended beyond our property lines.”

6.3

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources investigations documented in this
report and information provided by the current ASH Cemetery maintenance director, no
unmarked graves associated with the ASH Cemetery located north of West 51st Street appear
to be present south of West 51st Street within the investigated portion of the proposed Waller
Creekside Apartments project area. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a
reasonable and good faith effort to identify unmarked graves within the APE. As no evidence of
unmarked graves was encountered, no further archeological work is recommended in
connection with the proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the proposed project be
cleared to proceed. However, in the event that any human remains, burial furniture, or evidence
of unmarked graves are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or
ongoing maintenance of project facilities, whether in previously surveyed or unsurveyed areas,
all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the find and the THC should be notified of
the discovery.
