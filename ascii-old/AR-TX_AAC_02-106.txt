Abstract
Abasolo Archaeological Consultants (AAC) conducted archaeological monitoring
of three drill box excavations along the NuStar San Antonio Refinery Pipeline in
southern Bexar County, Texas. The Texas Historical Commission’s project review of the
final report followed AAC’s recommendations and stipulated that archaeological
monitoring be carried out of the planned trenching adjacent to the Southton Cemetery
(41BX1912), the drill box on the west side of Salado Creek near 41BX1912, the drill box
at 41BX1906, and the drill box south of the river near 41BX226. This report is a
supplement to the archaeological survey report submitted to the Texas Historical
Commission as required under TAC Permit No. 6068. No cultural resources were
observed in any of the drill pits and the excavations had no adverse impact on cultural
resources. No further archaeological work is recommended.

Introduction
Abasolo Archaeological Consultants (AAC) conducted archaeological monitoring
of three drill box excavations along the NuStar San Antonio Refinery Pipeline in
southern Bexar County, Texas. The Texas Historical Commission’s project review of the
final report followed AAC’s recommendations and stipulated that archaeological
monitoring be carried out of the planned trenching adjacent to the Southton Cemetery
(41BX1912), the drill box on the west side of Salado Creek near 41BX1912, the drill box
at 41BX1906, and the drill box south of the river near 41BX226.The drill box on the east
side of the Salado Creek was inspected, the purpose being to use the opportunity to
record the open excavations because the setting is high probability area for prehistoric
sites although there was no surface indication that a site was present. This brief report is a
supplement to the archaeological survey report submitted to the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) as required under TAC Permit No. 6068 (Shafer and Hester 2011).
Drill boxes are deep rectangular pits excavated at the point of inserting a core drill
for the pipeline. The function is to facilitate drilling a core for the pipeline as an
alternative to excavating a surface trench. The core will avoid surface features by slanting
the pipeline beneath them to avoid having to either trench through problem areas or
elevating a pipeline across rivers and creeks. By employing core drilling, such features
as the San Antonio River, Salado Creek, county roads, I-37, Southton Cemetery, cultural
resources, and other sensitive areas can be avoided. Drill boxes were excavated with a
large backhoe to depths of about five meters and cover an area of about 4 meters by five
meters.

Site 41BX1906/San Antonio River Monitoring

Monitoring the drill boxes on the north side of the San Antonio River at
41BX1906 and on the south side of the river was conducted by the author on January 9,
2012. The results of the monitoring are provided below.

Drill Box at 41BX1906: Site 41BX1906 was recorded by AAC as a trace of
lithic scatter with possible buried deposits near the San Antonio River (Shafer and Hester
2011: 9, 10) (Figs. 1, 2). Because of the possible presence of intact buried cultural
deposits monitoring was recommended.
The drill box excavation exposed a deep profile approximately three meters deep
of Duval sandy loam soils (Taylor et al. 1991: 22)(Figs. 3 and 4). The spoil back dirt and
profile were examined for traces of cultural material but the results were negative. The
profiles shown in Figures 3-5 can be described as follows:
The upper 50 cm consists of a brown clay loam which grades into a light brown
from 50 to about one meter below surface (Fig. 5). Below one meter calcium carbonate
nodules increase in frequency to the bottom of the excavation where they become very
dense.
No evidence of cultural material was observed in the back dirt or profile. No
cultural resources were adversely affected by this excavation.
Drill Pit South of the San Antonio River near 41BX226: This drill pit is
located on the late Quaternary terrace of the San Antonio River (labeled “Miller
Equivalent Terrace” by Thoms et al., 2001)(Fig. 6). The pit reached a depth of about
three meters (Fig. 7,8). The Venus clay loam (VcB 1-3% slope) (Taylor et al., 52) soils
are very deep and exhibit various brown hues, brown at the surface grading to a lighter
brown about 30-40 cm below the surface (Fig. 9). Soil color became a light brownish tan
from about 1 meter to the bottom of the excavation with a few calcareous stringers in the
lower half. A very few randomly distributed Rabdotus snail shells were noted but no
linear concentrations that would signify a possible cultural zone or climate interval. No
mussel shell, fire-cracked rock, or chipped stone were observed in any part of the
excavation. No cultural resources were disturbed by this drill pit excavation.

Salado Creek Drill Pits
Two drill pits were necessary to core the pipeline beneath Salado Creek. One was
located west of the creek and the other east of the creek (Fig. 10). The west drill pit was

4

monitored, and the east drill pit, which was not recommended for monitoring, was
inspected. This work was accomplished on February 1, 2012.
West Drill Pit: The initial plans for the NuStar pipeline indicated that a pipeline
trench and drill box would be excavated along a route adjacent to the Southton Cemetery.
AAC’s inspection of the cemetery indicated the presence of numerous unmarked graves.
THC was concerned about possibly encountering unmarked graves next to the cemetery
and stipulated that the trench and drill pit be monitored. NuStar, in response to THC
concerns, changed the plans to drill the pipe beneath the surface parallel to the cemetery
instead of trenching. This required moving the drill pit west of the cemetery for a
distance of about 100 meters (Fig. 10). The drill core itself would be at a depth of about
7.6 meters (25 feet) parallel to the cemetery and would avoid any possible disturbance
(Sheary Culp personal communication, January 2012).
The west drill pit was located on the east edge of the upper terrace overlooking an
old channel of the Salado Creek away from the cemetery (Fig. 10). While the location
was a high probability area for prehistoric archaeological sites there was no surface
indication that a site existed at that locality. The pit was excavated and monitored on
February 1, 2012 (Fig. 11). Excavation was halted at a depth of about one meter to allow
for profile inspection and recording (Fig.l2).
A description of the profile show in Figures 12 and 13 is as follows: Dark brown
soil (Munsell 10YR3/4) at the surface grades into dark yellowish-brown (10YR4/4) at
about 40-50 cm; below that level the soil continues to lighten to a light yellowish-brown
(10YR6/4). Beginning at about 50 cm calcium carbonate nodules appear and become
progressively more frequent below that level and are very dense at the bottom of the
excavation.
No cultural material was observed in the spoil dirt or in the pit profile.

East Drill Pit: The east drill pit was located on the high terrace of Salado Creek
just east of a large spoil dump area. NuStar also relocated this pit farther to the east due
to the unstable soils in the dump. AAC had not recommended monitoring this pit due to
the negative findings of the archaeological survey; THC also did not include monitoring

5

the east drill pit, but since it was open the pit was inspected and the results are reported
here. The spoil dirt and profile were examined and no trace of cultural material was
observed in either. The soil profile (Fig. 13) is almost identical to that observed on the
west side, consisting of brown loam overlying lighter soils laden with calcium carbonate
nodules. No cultural resources were disturbed by this drill pit excavation.

Summary and Conclusions

AAC conducted archaeological monitoring of three drill boxes and inspected a
fourth as part of the NuStar San Antonio Refinery Pipeline Project. The monitoring was
recommended by AAC based on the archaeological survey of high probability areas
along the seven mile pipeline route (Shafer and Hester 2012). AAC’s recommendations
were stipulated in the THC review of the final report.
The monitored drill pits were located at 41BX1906, across the San Antonio River
south of 41BX1906 but in the proximity of 41BX226, and near Southton Cemetery
(41BX1912). The drill pit east of Salado Creek also was inspected during the course of
monitoring the excavation west of Salado Creek. No cultural resources were observed in
any of the drill pits or caused any adverse impact on known cultural resources. No
further archaeological work is recommended.
