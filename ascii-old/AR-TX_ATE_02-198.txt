Abstract

Abstract
In May 2017, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological survey
along the SH-99 Segment 1-2 drainage easement at Goose Creek, south of Baytown,
Texas. This survey was done in advance of proposed improvements to the extant drainage.
The project was conducted under subcontract to Ecosystem Planning and Restoration,
LLC on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) to comply with Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas. Work was
performed under Antiquities Permit No. 7901. AmaTerra surveyed the 0.75-mile (12.1acre) Area of Potential Effects (APE) on private property wherever access was available.
Archeologists visually inspected the APE and excavated 21 shovel tests in support of the
project. One new archeological site was documented: Site 41HR1196. This is a historic
period archeological site related to the area’s use as an oil field beginning in 1908. Very
little if any of the site remains intact, and it is not recommended for further National
Register or State Archeological Landmark eligibility testing.
AmaTerra was unable to assess a .35-mile stretch of the APE because it was inundated
with water at the time of survey. The marshy vegetation throughout this portion of the
APE suggests that it is regularly covered by water. In addition, right of entry (ROE) was
not granted for two parcels near the north end of the APE. These parcels only accounted
for approximately 1.1 acres of the total APE and do not need to be surveyed based on
the results of the other portions of the project. AmaTerra recommends that the project
may proceed for all areas. This was a non-collection survey. All project related notes and
records will be permanently curated at the Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State
University.

Chapter 1

Introduction and Management Summary
In May of 2017, under subcontract to Ecosystem Planning and Restoration, Inc. (EPR) and
on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), AmaTerra Environmental,
Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological survey in advance of the proposed Loop 336
improvement project in southern Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas (CSJ No: 0338-11056; Figure 1). The project will extend from Interstate Highway (IH) 45 to Farm-to-Market
(FM) 1314, a distance of approximately 2.25 miles. The proposed project would expand
an existing two-lane facility into a divided, four-lane median separated highway with a
sidewalk on the south side of the eastbound lanes. All work would take place within an
existing dedicated 300-foot right-of-way (ROW).

Area of Potential Effects
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archeological resources for this undertaking
is defined as the footprint of the proposed project to the maximum depth of impact,
including all easements, utility relocations, and project specific locations. Therefore, the
APE for archeological resources will cover a total distance of approximately 2.25 miles
and encompass an area roughly 86 acres in size. The proposed undertaking will take
place entirely within a 300-foot-wide existing ROW. The vertical APE (depth of impacts)
is estimated to extend no more than three to five feet below the subsurface. Project
schematics provided by the Houston District are in Appendix A.
The proposed project is being funded by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
through TxDOT and is subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review. Since
the project is being built with Federal transportation money on land owned or controlled
by the State of Texas, it is also considered an undertaking subject to the provisions
outlined under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106), as
well as the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Therefore, AmaTerra’s work conformed to the
guidelines under 36 CFR Part 800 and 13 TAC Chapter 26, which outline the regulations
for implementing Section 106 and the ACT respectively.
All work was conducted under the terms and conditions of the First Amended Programmatic
Agreement for Transportation Undertakings (2005; PA-TU) among the FHWA, TxDOT, the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and
the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the THC.
Coordination with TxDOT resulted in a survey recommendation for the entire APE.
Archeological investigations consisted of a pedestrian survey and shovel testing of all
undisturbed portions of the proposed APE, where access was available. The undertaking
would be built on public property, of which, AmaTerra had access to 100 percent of the
proposed APE at the time of survey. Archeologists excavated a total of 79 shovel tests along

two survey transects. While no new archeological sites were recorded, archeologists did
observed a plainware whiteware ceramic sherd, a blue vessel glass shard, and a milk glass
shard in the gravels of Stewarts Creek. However, the artifacts are in secondary context and
did not originate from within the APE. No additional archeological work is recommended
for the APE at this time.
Field investigations took place from May 1–3, 2017 under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
8006. Julian (Drew) Sitters acted as Principal Investigator and field lead, while Noel Steinle
assisted with field investigations. A total of 60 person hours were expended in the field in
support of this project. Weather conditions were good and archeologists encountered no
difficulties in completing the investigations. This was a no collection survey; therefore, all
artifacts were returned to their original location.
This report is divided into six chapters. The project background and cultural overview are
discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 4 includes the field methodology implemented
during the project and the results of field investigations are discussed in Chapter 5.
Chapter 6 presents the summary and recommendations.

Project Background
Environmental Setting
Physiography
The APE is located within the Southern Tertiary Uplands, a subregion of the South Central
Plains ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). This ecoregion, which is locally known as the “piney
woods” (Gould 1975), “represents the western edge of the southern coniferous forest belt”
(Griffith et al. 2007:87). Encompassing approximately 7,667 square miles, this subregion
is characterized by “dissected irregular plains with some low, rolling hills; low to moderate
gradient streams with sandy and silty substrates” (Griffith et al. 2007:91). Elevation within
the Southern Tertiary Uplands ranges from 90 to 550 feet Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL).

Vegetation
Historically, natural vegetation within the Southern Tertiary Uplands consisted of upland
longleaf pine-bluestem (Pinus palustris-Schizachyrium spp. and Andropogon spp.)
woodlands, shortleaf pine-hardwood (Pinus echinata-Quercus spp.) forests, and mixed
hardwood-loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forests, as well as American beech (Fagus grandifolia)
or magnolia-beech-forests, bogs, and sandstone glades. Bog plant species include southern
sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), hollies or gallberry (Ilex spp.), wax-myrtles (Morella spp.),
insectivorous plants, orchids, and wild azalea (Rhododendron spp.). Today, pine forest is
the dominant vegetation type with National Forest land making up large parts of this region.
Aside from public land, additional land uses include pine plantations, timber production,
and some pasture and livestock production (Griffith et al. 2007).

Climate
The climate within the Southern Tertiary Uplands is subtropical with hot, usually humid,
and wet summers with mild to cool winters (Peel et al. 2007). Annually, the APE receives
roughly 40 to 50 inches of precipitation and has a mean annual air temperature of 67
degrees Fahrenheit (USDA-NRCS 2017).

Geology and Soils
The APE is underlain by the Pliocene-age Willis Formation (Qwc), which is composed mostly
of clay, silt, sand, and siliceous granule to pebble gravel (BEG 1992). According to the
United States Department of Agriculture – Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDANRCS) Web Soil Survey (2017), the APE encompasses eight named soil units (Table 1;
Figure 2). Soils are characterized by loam to very fine sandy loam with restrictive features,
such as clay, encountered as shallow as 36 centimeters below the ground surface (cmbs).

Chapter 3

Regional Chronology and Cultural Background
The project area is situated within the Southeast Texas archeological region (Perttula
2004). Human occupation in the Southeast Texas archeological region can be divided into
two stages: Prehistoric and Historic. Furthermore, the Prehistoric Stage can be divided into
the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric Periods. A brief description of these stages
and periods is provided below.

Pre-Clovis and Paleoindian
The arrival of humans in the New World may have occurred as early as 16,000 years ago
with Pre-Clovis peoples (Jennings and Waters 2014). Pre-Clovis occupation of Texas is
evident at the Debra L. Friedkin Site located along Buttermilk Creek in Bell County (Waters
et al. 2011). Artifacts found at this site include bifaces, a discoidal core, edge-modified
flake tools, blade fragments, bladelets, a polished piece of hematite, and macrodebitage.
Other sites in Texas with probable Pre-Clovis components include the Gault Site, situated
upstream from the Debra L. Friedkin Site (Collins nd). Following Pre-Clovis is the Paleoindian
Period, which dates from 11,500 to 8000 BP.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile point types) associated with the Paleoindian Period
and found within the Southeast Texas archeological region include Clovis, Folsom, San
Patrice, Scottsbluff, Plainview, and Angostura projectile points. No systematic excavation of
a Paleoindian site has taken place in this region. However, Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered from mixed contexts of Archaic age. Artifacts associated with the Paleoindian
period have been found in abundance on the surface especially along major stream
drainages. In fact, one of these sites is situated on an ancient tributary stream drainage
currently located offshore of McFaddin Beach.

Archaic
The Archaic Stage is typically divided into three smaller subperiods, Early, Middle and Late,
and is characterized by a wider variety of plant and animal exploitation with a slight decrease
in group mobility over the Paleoindian Period (Black 1989). Additionally, “the Archaic in
Texas is generally defined by pre- or nonhorticultural adaptations and pre-ceramic and prebow-and-arrow hunting technologies” (Ricklis 2004: 184). Sites are typically located along
stream courses and diagnostic point types include the Bell/Calf Creek, Travis, Yarbrough,
Bulverde, Kent, Gary, and Ensor, to name a few.
During the Late Archaic Period, “a shift to the use of poorer quality and more local lithic
resources…suggests reduced group mobility and more tightly defined group territories”
(Story 1990 cited in Ricklis 2004: 185). This assumption is also supported by the increase

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Survey of the Loop 336 Improvement Project, Montgomery County, Texas

in cemeteries during the Late Archaic times. Due to the numerous Late Archaic sites it is
believed this subperiod experienced a significant population growth.
The earliest evidence for estuarine resource exploitation on the upper Texas coast comes
from site 41GV53, which produced an uncalibrated radiocarbon date of 5000-4200 BP,
and the Eagle’s Ridge site. These sites produced large shell middens, a barrel-shaped
conch columenlla bed, cut rangia and gastropod shells, perforated oyster shell and rangia
valves, and fish remains (Ricklis 2004). While white-tailed deer accounted for 80 percent
of the animal biomass at the Eagle Ridge site, fish came in second with 10 percent of the
biomass.
The Archaic Period ends with the introduction of ceramic wares.

Ceramic Period
Ceramics appear in the archeological records around AD 100 in the Galveston Bay area.
Despite the emergence of ceramics, “there are currently no indications of major changes
in lifeways during the Early Ceramic Period” (Ricklis 2004: 189). Dee Ann Story (1990)
has suggested that Ceramic Period cultures are archeologically distinct from neighboring
regions. Thus, resulting in her coining of the term Mossy Grover Tradition/Culture for the
Ceramic Period in the area.
Sites associated with the Mossy Grove Culture are found in the upper Texas Gulf coast,
southwestern Louisiana, and the southern portions of the Texas Piney Woods. Utilizing
ceramics composed of a sandy paste, the Mossy Grove culture is characterized by thin,
decorated ceramics with narrow incised lines and punctations. Many of these ceramics are
described as, “sandy paste wares with thin walls, floated surfaces, and rounded or conicalshaped bases” (Ellis 2013:141). Differences in settlement and subsistence patterns,
as well as technology has led archeologists to divide this tradition into two sub-periods:
the Coastal margins and the Inland Coastal Plain (Ellis 2013). The inland subregion is
characterized by a hunter and gatherer subsistence strategy with short term occupation
sites consisting of plain sandy paste ceramics, Gary and Kent dart points, sparse lithic
scatters, and ground stone. Sites with Mossy Grove cultural components include the Jonas
Hill site (41PK8) and the Crawford site (41PK69) (Ensor and Carlson 1988; McClurkan
1968).

Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric Period saw the shift in hunting technology from the atlatl to the bow
and arrow around AD 700 (Ricklis 2004). This technology enabled prehistoric hunters to
harvest prey from greater distances with a lesser need for brushless, wide open spaces
required for atlatl maneuverability. The use of arrows is indicated by “the appearance of
small, light straight- and expanding-stem stone arrow points” (Ricklis 2004:194). Projectile
points associated with the Late Prehistoric Period include Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz, and
Scallorn types. This Period is often divided into two subperiods. The first subperiod involves
10

Archeological Survey of the Loop 336 Improvement Project, Montgomery County, Texas

the introduction of the bow and arrow, while the second subperiod encompasses the Toyah
Phase, a time of extensive bison exploitation.

Historic
Conroe, the county seat of Montgomery County, was established when Houston lumberman
Isaac Conroe moved his sawmill from Stewarts Creek to the International & Great Northern
Railroad’s (I&GN) Houston-Crockett line. By 1884, Conroe’s sawmill became a station along
the I&GN Railroad. Around this time, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway’s Navasota
to Montgomery spur was built through Conroe forming the only major junction of rail lines
in Montgomery County. Settlers moved to the region with the prospect of profiting from
the region’s lumber boom. By 1892, the town of Conroe supported five steam-powered
saw and planning mills, several brickyards, a cotton gin, a gristmill, several hotels and
general stores, and supported a population of 500 residents. Conroe became an important
shipping point for lumber, cotton, livestock, tobacco, and bricks (Jackson 2016). Both the
agricultural and timber industries continued to thrive through the early twentieth century,
but was curtailed with the dwindling supply of local timber and the Great Depression. In
1931, George W. Strake discovered oil seven miles to the southeast of Conroe, which
temporarily stimulated the local economy. A revival of the lumber industry, the construction
of Interstate Highway 45, and the impounding of the West Fork of the San Jacinto River
forming Lake Conroe all helped to promote growth within the community. Today, the City of
Conroe supports 63,322 residents (Jackson 2016).

Cultural Resources in Proximity to the Project Area
Background research for this project consisted of an online records search through the
THC’s Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas; 2017) and a review of historical maps and aerial
photographs. Research focused on the identification of archeological sites, sites listed as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites
listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), cemeteries, and previously
conducted archeological surveys within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE (Figure 3).
The search revealed that no previously recorded archeological sites, SALs, RTHLs, or sites
listed on the NRHP fall within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE. However, one cemetery
and 13 previously conducted archeological surveys are near or bisect the APE.
A least 13 previously conducted archeological surveys fall within one kilometer (0.62 mile)
of the APE (Table 2). Of these, three bisect the current project area. Surprisingly, only one
of the archeological surveys resulted in the recording of new archeological sites; none of
which, are located within the APE.
The Conroe Memorial Park Cemetery (Cemetery ID Number: MQ-C011) is situated
approximately 825 meters (0.5 mile) to the north of the APE. The cemetery opened in 1944
and reportedly contains over three thousand interments. While still active, the proposed
undertaking will not have any foreseen effects on the cemetery.

Prehistoric Land Use
A review of archeological sites near, but outside of the one kilometer (0.62 mile) buffer
(41MQ62, 41MQ299, 41MQ321, 41MQ322, 41MQ323, 41MQ324, and 41MQ325),
revealed multiple short to long-term prehistoric occupation sites situated along the edge
of stream terraces that overlook small creeks or drainages. These sites contained a
range of cultural materials including lithic debitage composed of chert, petrified wood,
and quartzite, a flake core, both dart and arrow points, ceramic sherds, and non-human
faunal remains. Artifacts were recorded between 10 and 100+ cmbs within the Landman
fine sand soil unit. According to the sites’ recorder(s), all but one site (41MQ62) lacked
research potential and were recommended ineligible for listing to the NRHP or as a SAL.

Historic Land Use
According to a 1901 General Land Office Map of Montgomery County, Texas, the APE
crosses land originally patented by Hansom House and A. M. Folks (Figure 4). A 1938 USDA
Map of the Sam Houston National Forest depicts the APE as devoid of development with
the exception of a pipeline owned by the Prairie Pipe Line Company (Figure 5). In 1953,
the APE remained undeveloped with the exception of a transmission line corridor and the
construction of FM 1314 at the project’s easternmost end (Figure 6). Urban development
began to encroach upon the APE by the late 1970s (Figure 7). Two cleared, linear features
are visible crossing the APE at this time and are either pipelines or unimproved roads.
Loop 336 was constructed sometime prior to 1989. However, aside from the construction
of FM 336 and the pipelines or transmission lines, the APE has remained forested and
relatively free of development (see Figure 1).

Methodology
Prior to field investigations, archeologists conducted archival research to assess the
potential for buried historic and prehistoric archeological materials. This research involved
examining historical maps, aerial photographs, soil maps, and the Potential Archeological
Liability Map of the Houston District (Abbott 2011). As mentioned above, archeologists
consulted the Atlas to assess the potential for prehistoric archeological sites within the
APE. This not only allowed investigators to determine the presence of previously recorded
archeological sites within the APE, but also to gain a sense of site types, artifact types, and
average depth of cultural materials below the surface, among other things. This information
coupled with topography and proximity to water, allowed investigators to define areas of
high probability for archeological sites (Figure 8). The background study determined that
the APE has archeological potential mainly around Stewarts Creek and Little Caney Creek.
The APE limits, along with areas deemed to have potential for containing archeological
materials, were overlaid on topographic maps and loaded onto hand-held DeLorme GPS
units to aid in navigation.
Archeological fieldwork consisted of a pedestrian survey supplemented by both systematic
and strategically placed shovel tests. Investigators manually excavated 79 shovel tests
at approximately 100-meter intervals along two survey transects within APE. However,
shovel test spacing was reduced within those areas having higher archeological
potential (Appendix B). While conducting the pedestrian survey, archeologists observed
multiple areas of disturbance. Areas of disturbances were thoroughly photographed and
archeologists made notes on the conditions they encountered during their investigations.
Archeologists attempted to avoid these observed disturbances during shovel testing. In
addition, investigators visually assessed the banks and beds of both Little Caney and
Stewarts Creeks for cultural material and/or features.
Shovel tests measured 30 centimeters in diameter and extended to a maximum depth
of 80 centimeters below surface (cmbs) or until encountering restrictive features (e.g.,
dense clay). The shovel tests were excavated in 10-centimeter increments and all soil
was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. Relevant information for all shovel tests
was recorded on a standardized form. Shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. This
archeological investigation was a non-collection survey; therefore, artifacts, were returned
to their original location.

Survey Results
The proposed Loop 336 improvement project is taking place within a rapidly growing
suburban community. The natural landscape within the APE is generally flat with subtle
topographic relief ranging in elevation from approximately 141 to 182 feet AMSL. The
APE crosses two named creeks, Little Caney and Stewarts Creeks, and one unnamed wet
weather drainage. Vegetation within the APE consisted of young to mature pine, young oak,
and magnolia trees, palmetto, greenbrier, medium grasses, blackberry, and wildflowers
(Figure 9). During field investigations the temperature ranged from 42 to 88 degrees
Fahrenheit and the project area received 0.23 inches of rain.
Soils encountered within the APE were relatively deep (Depth: min 5 cmbs; max 80 cmbs;
average 65 cmbs) and were characterized by pale brown (10YR 6/3) to light yellowish
brown (10YR 6/4) fine to very fine sandy loam containing colored pebbles underlain by a
dense yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy clay. Ground surface visibility ranged from poor
to good across the APE (Figures 10a–c). Within the tree line ground surface visibility was
hampered by leaf litter; thus, considered poor (0 percent). On the other hand, ground
surface visibility within the treeless corridor was moderate (ranging from 30 to 70 percent).
Lastly, around disturbances the ground surface visibility was good (from 70 to 90 percent).
Investigators had access to 100 percent of the proposed APE. Along the 2.25-mile stretch,
archeologists excavated a total of 79 shovel tests (Appendices B and C) for a rate of one
shovel test every 75 meters, or one shovel test for every 1.08 acres. Within the 21.5 acres
defined as having high potential for prehistoric archeological sites, 33 of the 79 shovel tests
were excavated for a rate of one shovel test for every 0.65 acre. None of the shovel tests
contained any artifacts. Archeologists walked the creek beds looking for cultural materials.
There was no stream flow within Little Caney Creek (Figure 11A) exposing a large gravel
bar composed of colored gravels under the Loop 336 bridge. No cultural materials were
observed within Little Caney Creek. However, Stewarts Creek (Figure 11B), with a weak
current and sandy gravel bars, contained one plain whiteware sherd, a blue vessel glass
shard, and a milk glass shard. The historic materials are in secondary context and did not
originate from within the APE.
Visual reconnaissance revealed disturbances associated with both transportation and
urban development within the APE. For example, roadside drainages border both sides
of Loop 336 (Figure 12), buried utilities are present in numerous locations along the
roadway (Figure 13), and artificially leveled and paved surfaces are present at many of the
intersections (Figure 14). Archeologists did not shovel test within these localities.
Ultimately, no new archeological sites were observed within the APE.

Recommendations
AmaTerra surveyed the proposed 2.25-mile long Loop 336 improvement project, from
IH-45 to FM 1314, in southern Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas. The project was
conducted under Section 106 and the ACT and work conformed to the guidelines for
implementation of these regulations under 36 CFR Part 800 and 13 TAC Chapter 26.
Access was available to 100 percent of the proposed APE. Conditions affecting fieldwork
included poor ground surface visibility, and disturbances associated within transportation
and urban development.
Archeologists conducted a thorough pedestrian survey and excavated 79 shovel tests in
support of this project. Shovel tests were placed at regular intervals (approximately every
100 meters) along the proposed improvement project, as well as strategically placed within
areas having high archeological potential. No archeological materials of any sort were
observed on the ground surface or found in any of the shovel tests. However, investigators
did document a plain whiteware sherd, a blue vessel glass shard, and a milk glass shard
in the bed of Stewarts Creek. The artifacts are in secondary context and did not originate
from within the APE. No shovel tests were conducted within disturbed areas; specifically,
within the transmission and pipeline corridor or in the roadside drainage ditches. A visual
inspection of these areas suggests that the potential for buried, in situ archeological
materials is low. Based on the results of the archeological survey AmaTerra recommends
no further work for any portion of the APE.
Archeologists did not collect any artifacts during this survey and therefore none will be
curated at TARL. This report is submitted in fulfillment of Antiquities Permit No. 8006.
