ABSTRACT
The lower Pecos area of southwestern Texas is known for its rockshelters which have
excellent preservation of archaeological material. This study is a paleoethnobotanical
analysis conducted to determine the subsistence and diet of a group of hunter-gatherers in
the lower Pecos region, inhabiting Baker Cave, Val Verde County, at approximately A.D.
900. The analysis is centered on the micro and macroremains recovered from 38 coprolites
(dessicated human feces) excavated from a latrine area near the front of the limestone
rockshelter. Changes in prehistoric diet through time in the lower Pecos region are
explored, using information from other coprolite studies from the area, and aspects of the
overall health and nutrition of the prehistoric population are determined using a
parasitological study and a nutritional analysis of the contents of the coprolites. Based upon
the coprolites Baker Cave inhabitants were documented to be using mainly prickly pear
cactus, onion bulbs and fiber, fish, and rodents in their diets. The flower or seeds from
Brassicaceae (mustard), sagebrush, and grass were probably eaten as well. An increase in
the diversity of the diet is observed as compared to that of earlier lower Pecos area studies.
The Baker Cave occupants were using what was available in their environment to maintain
a relatively stable, healthy population.

PREFACE
This study of the coprolites and diet of Baker Cave was originally prepared in 1988 as a
Master's thesis at Texas A&M University. In order to more broadly disseminate the
important information generated by this research, the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory has undertaken joint publication of the volume with the Texas A&M University
Department of Anthropology.
The coprolites were recovered at Baker Cave in 1984 during excavations by the Center for
Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and the Witte
Museum (San Antonio Museum Association). It is to the Witte, its director Mark Lane,
and its curator of anthropology, Roberta McGregor, that we owe much in terms of funding
and other support for the 1984 excavations. The Witte continued its involvement in Baker
Cave studies in 1985, when Kenneth Brown directed additional excavations at that site.
(Additional support came from the Texas Archaeological Foundation.)
The archeology of Baker Cave began with excavations conducted in the mid-1960s by
James H. Word and was published in Word and Douglas (1970). Later, in 1968, John Greer,
then a graduate student at The University of Texas at Austin, worked at the site; notes and
collections from Greer's work are curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. In 1976, Robert E Heizer and I carried out limited excavations at the site;
these are reported in Chadderdon (1983) and Hester (1978, 1979, 1983, 1986). Next came
the UTSA-Witte excavations noted above (see Brown 1991).
Much analysis remains to be done with the wealth of archeological materials excavated at
Baker Cave. The special study by Sobolik published here is a significant step in that
direction.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
The lower Pecos region of southwestern Texas is known for its dry, limestone
rockshelters that have excellent preservation of archaeological materials. Baker
Cave (41 VV213), located in Val Verde County. Texas. along a dry tributary of the
Devils River, is a rockshelter that contained a tremendous amount of prehistoric
artifacts and botanical remains. Part of these remains included a latrine area of 38
coprolites, dated to approximately A.D. 850 (Beta-15634, 1100± 100 B.P.).
Coprolites, from the Greek words copros (dung) and lith os (stones), are dessicated
human feces which contain actual foods ingested by prehistoric people.
The main objective of this study is to improve our understanding of the prehis­
toric diet and subsistence practices of the inhabitants of Baker Cave. The
information on diet is based on the analysis of plant, animal, and pollen remains from
these coprolites. Aspects of the overall health and nutrition of the prehistoric
population is also determined using a parasitological study and a nutritional analysis
of the contents of the Baker Cave coprolites. Changes in prehistoric diet through
time in the lower Pecos region are also explored. using information from other
coprolite studies from the area.
The Value of Coprolite Studies

The evaluation of prehistoric subsistence practices has become an important
consideration for archaeologists. Subsistence knowledge, the reconstruction of diet,
and health can be gained through a number of techniques, most significantly with the
analysis of coprolites (dessicated human feces), ethnobotanical material, and faunal
remains, and through information recorded in ethnographies. All of the above
techniques need to be used in order to make a comprehensive statement about the
entire diet or nutrition of a population. Coprolites, however, are a unique resource
for determining prehistoric subsistence whose analyses offer direct approaches to the
question of diet (Bryant 1974a) and encompasses all of the analyses mentioned
above. The constituents of a coprolite are mostly the remains of intentionally eaten
food items, with the possible exception of wind-blown pollen contaminants, grit, and
feces-thriving insects. Coprolites, thus, can be used to determine diet, health,
seasonality of occupation, processing practices, and overall subsistence ofa popula­
tion, under ideal conditions. Coprolites also represent the dietary remains of specific
individuals. This type of precise sample cannot be replicated as accurately from
animal or plant debris recovered from archaeological sites.
Coprolite studies are a subdivision of paleoethnobotany, defined as the recovery,
identification, and interpretation of plant remains excavated from archaeological
contexts (Ford 1979). Other major subdivisions in paleoethnobotany include the

1

analysis of pollen, charcoal and wood, flotation samples, silicate or calcium oxylate
crystals, macrobotanical materials, and the fibers of baskets or textiles.
In order to conduct a thorough coprolite analysis the researcher should be able
to identify and interpret all types of botanical remains and non· botanical remains,
such as animal bone and hair, shells, fish and reptile scales, feathers, insects, and
parasites, to name the major coprolitic constituents. If the analyst cannot identify all
of the above items, then specialists should be asked to make correct identifications.
Coprolite analysis thus covers a myriad of sciences, other than strictly paleoeth·
nobotany.
The first recorded observations of coprolites were in the early 1800s from animals
of early geologic age; the Cretaceous in England (Mantell 1822; Agassiz 1833·43) and
North America (Dekay 1830), the Lower Jurassic in England (Buckland 1829), and
the Eocene in France (Robert 1832·33). Later studies of animal coprolites in North
America include the ground sloth (Martin et a1. 1961) and other Pleistocene animals
(Davis et a1. 1984).
The potential of human coprolites as dietary indicators was realized by
Harshberger in 1896. However, the first analyses were not conducted until after the
beginning of the twentieth century. These initial studies were conducted by Smith
and Jones (1910), who examined the dried fecal remains from Nubian mummies, and
by Young (1910) and Loud and Harrington (1929) on North American cave material.
The processing techniques for these early analyses consisted of either cutting open
the dry coprolites and observing the large, visible contents, or grinding the samples
through screens, breaking much of the material in the process.
An improved technique for analyzing coprolites was developed by Callen and
Cameron (1960), refining a technique developed by Benninghoff (1947) for rehydrat·
ing herbarium specimens and Van Cleave and Ross (1947) for rehydrating zoological
specimens. This technique involved rehydrating the coprolite sample in a mild
solution of tri-sodium phosphate, a detergent, in order to gently break apart the
materials for ease in screening. This technique, which is still used today,
revolutionized the science of coprolite analysis.
Using this improved technique, early macroanalyses conducted on coprolites
included works by Callen (1967b, 1968), Bryant (1969), Napton (1970), and Mar·
quardt (1974). Callen (1967b, 1968) examined material from Tamaulipas, Mexico,
proposing the addition of foxtail millet (Setaria) to the agricultural array: Bryant
(1969) was the first to examine human coprolites from the Archaic period in regions
of the arid Chihuahuan Desert of west Texas. Napton (1970) studied material from
Lovelock Cave, Nevada, proposing a lacustrine adaptation, and Marquardt (1974)
statistically analyzed two groups of coprolites from Mammoth Cave, Kentucky,
proposing similar subsistence strategies between the two groups.

INTRODUCTION / 3

The Callen and Cameron rehydration technique was especially useful for
parasitological analyses, permitting the recovery of fragile ova. Parasitological
analyses of coprolites are most extensive from the Great Basin in Utah. These studies
include the works by Fry (1976a, 1980), Fry and Moore (1969), Hall (1972), and
Reinhard et a1. (1985). Other parasitological analyses were conducted by Hall (1977)
on coprolite material from Oregon, Patrucco et a1. (1983) on coprolite material from
Peru, Fount (1981) on remains from Pre-Columbian mummies representing diverse
populations, and Williams (1985) on the analysis of pelvic soil from a Plains burial.
Martin and Sharrock (1964), with samples from Glen Canyon, Utah, were the first
to conduct direct pollen analyses on coprolites. Callen and Martin (1969) also
conducted pollen analyses on coprolites from Glen Canyon, Utah, documenting the
prehistoric ingestion of beeweed (Cleome). Their microscopic analysis of the pollen
from coprolites represented the first evidence of use of this plant as food by humans.
Later Bryant (1974b) conducted pollen analyses on material from Mammoth Cave,
Kentucky, reconstructing diet and possible seasonality of occupation, and Williams­
Dean and Bryant (1975) analyzed samples from Antelope House, Arizona. The
importance of Cleome to Anasazi diet, as well as cultivated corn, beans, and squash,
was indicated in a pollen analysis of Hoy House coprolites (Scott 1979).
However, coprolite analysis has some inherent problems. How much the
coprolite contents reflect actual food intake is unknown. The contents of coprolites
are made of indigestible foods. The actual used portion has been absorbed by the
body. It is estimated that meat protein may be completely absorbed during the
digestion process (Fry 1985). The underepresentation of meat within coprolites can
be observed as the amount of bone materials recovered from zooarchaeological
analyses and corproli te studies are compared. Lord (1984) recovered 64 different
faunal taxa in his analysis of Hinds Cave material, and 40 taxa were identified from
Baker's Cave material (Douglas 1970). The macroremains of the Baker Cave
coprolites contained only seven different faunal taxa. This strongly suggests that
coprolites severely underepresent meat intake.
The direct association of a coprolite or a group of coprolites (such as in a latrine
situation) with a group of people if also problematic. When dealing with a latrine
situation, the actual defecators are unknown. "Rarely are feces found away from the
designated latrine area" (Shafer 1986:99) indicating that most everyone would use
the latrine. Therefore, the coprolites may reflect deposition and thus food usage, by
the group. Alternatively, the coprolites may only reflect the deposition of one sick
person forced to defecate in the area near his/her bed. In this example the coprolites
may contain a high amount of medicinal items, although medicines were also most
likely used by the population in everyday life for minor problems.
A group of coprolites could also represent the fecal matter of mainly women and
children (when dealing with a hunter-gatherer group) who remain near camp during
the day, the men mainly defecating away from the camp during their hunting expedi­
tions. This may lead to problems if women and children eat different foods from the

4 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER CAVE

men or are restricted from certain dietary items due to cultural constraints, such as
taboos.
Because of the inherent problems with such a data base, this study will begin with
three main assumptions: 1) in general, the remains observed from the coprolites
reflect what was ingested; 2) the coprolites from the latrine area reflect what was
deposited by the entire group; and 3) the remains observed from the coprolites
reflect what is available and eaten by the entire group, foregoing any cultural food
constraints. These assumptions are stated in order to lay the framework for this
dietary and nutritional study, although they may be proven false in the future.
The Lower Pecos Area
The lower Pecos area is located in southwestern Texas and northern Mexico in
Coahuila, centering around the Pecos and Devils rivers and their confluence with the
Rio Grande (Fig. 1). The lower Pecos area is on the eastern boundary of the
Chihuahuan biotic provence, and the environment of this area is similar to that of the
southwestern United States, semi-arid and dry. These conditions contribute to the
excellent preservation of the cultural resources observed in the rockshel ters and
open sites of the area. The marginally desertic conditions present today in the area
are most likely the same as much of the past environment, although around 550 B.C.
there was a possible brief climatic shift to more mesic conditions in the area (Dering
1979; Byrant and Holloway 1985).
Prehistoric habitation of the lower Pecos canyon areas began at least 9,000 years
ago (Shafer 1981). The culturallifeways of these populations were centered around
the semi-arid environment, in which a conservative foraging adaptation was mainly
followed. However, slight shifts in the pattern have been noted (Stock 1983; Shafer
1986). The subsistence base of the prehistoric occupants of the lower Pecos area was
centered around a stable resource, the desert succulents, consisting mainly of sotol,
prickly pear, and lechuguilla (Shafer and Bryant 1977; Williams-Dean 1978; Dering
1979; Shafer 1981; Stock 1983; Brown 1986). These desert succulents were used as
food items, and in textiles, basketry, sandals, netting, and firewood (Shafer 1986).
The lower Pecos area was first designated the Painted Caves area by early sur­
veyors, and in 1881 the first Southern Pacific Railroad station, in this area, was named
Painted Caves (Turpin 1984a). The lower Pecos River style rock art, from ~hich the
name Painted Caves originated, is a dramatic series of paintings depicting abstract
figures and zoomorphic forms with a dominant anthropomorphic shaman motif
(Kirkland and Newcomb 1967). The geographic distribution of the Pecos River style
rock art has been used to infer territorial ranges of the lower Pecos populations
(Shafer 1977). The home range of these prehistoric foragers has been determined to
a 1002 mile area, although they most likely ventured outside of this range (Shafer
1977).

Other distinct cultural aspects of these prehistoric foragers include painted peb­
bles (Pearce and Jackson 1933; Davenport and Chelf 1938; Shafer 1986), intricate
textiles and basketry (Andrews and Adovasio 1980; Shafer 1986), and a few clay
figurines (Shafer 1975). Burned rock middens are also present in the area. Dome­
shaped burned rock middens date from about 4,000 B.c. in west central and central
Texas areas. It has been suggested that these features resulted from acorn processing
and roasting (Creel 1986). Crescent-shaped middens appear around A.D. 600 in
southwest Texas. The function of these pit has been determined to include the
roasting of lechuguilla and sotol (Dering 1977; Moore 1980).
ENVIRONMENT

The Devils River is situated in an ecotonal environment bordered by the
mesquite-chaparral zone of the Tamaulipan biotic province in southern Texas, the
oak-cedar zone of the Edwards Plateau in the Balconian biotic province to the east,
and the sotol-Iechuguilla zone of the Chihuahuan province to the west (Blair 1950;
Chadderdon 1983). The Baker Cave area contains a diversity of plants from all three
environmental zones. Vegetation observed in the area today which is representative
of the mesquite-chaparral zone includes acacia (Acacia), mesquite (Prosopis), hack­
berry (Celtis), and persimmon (Diospyros). Sotol (Dasylirion), lechuguilla (Agave),
cenizo (Leucophyllum) , and ocotillo (Fouqueria) are representatives of the sotol­
lechuguilla zone, and juniper (Juniperus) and the oaks (Quercus) are representatives
of the oak-cedar zone (Smith and Butterwick 1975; Chadderdon 1983). Other plants
observed in the area today include evergreen sumac (Rhus), Texas mountain laurel
(Sophora), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia), yucca (Yucca), and agarito (Berberis) on the
canyon slopes and ridges. Pecan (Carya), littleleafwalnut (Juglans), willows (Salix),
and ferns (Polypodiaceae) are observed in the canyon bottoms, along streams, and
along the Devils River (Smith and Butterwick 1975; Chadderdon 1983). For a com­
plete listing of the plants observed in the Devils River area see Smith and Butterwick
(1975).
The fauna in the area consists of a large variety of mammals. Mammals observed
in the lower Pecos area are discussed by Davis (1974) and Schmidly (1977) and are
listed in Table 1. There are also a large variety of fish observed in the lower Pecos
area and in the Devils River specifically. A list of the freshwater fishes that could
possibly be native to the area is compiled in Table 2. This list, which does not include
exotic fish or recent intrusives, was compiled by David J. Lee in order to make a
comparative collection for the identification of fish scales prevalent in the coprolites.
Reptiles and amphibians in the area are discussed by Dixon (1987) and art: listed in
Table 3.
The climate of the lower Pecos area is described as semiarid continental (Nation­
al Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] 1981). The most variable
aspect of the climate of the lower Pecos area is the rainfall, with a recorded average
between 1916 and 1962 of 457 mm, although extreme variations range from 110 mm
in 1956 to 959 mm in 1914 (Arbingast et a1. 1976). Although variable, the amount of
precipitation in the area is considered insufficient for dry farming (NOAA 1981).

INTRODUCTION I 13

The average temperature for the Del Rio region is 20.9 degrees Celsius, with the
seasons characterized by long, warm summers and mild, dry winters (NOAA 1981).
The Edwards Plateau and the Stockton Plateau converge in Val Verde County,
with separation of these two areas occurring at the Pecos River. Outcrops in the
eastern half of the county, containing the dry Devils River tributaries, consist of
exposed Cretaceous limestone surface formations of the Comanche series, par­
ticularly the Edwards Formation (Spice 1954). Evidence from deep well drilling has
suggested that this Comanche series is underlain by Permian rocks (Spice 1954).
Baker Cave "is a large solution cavity formed in the Segovia member of the Edwards
Limestone" (Brown n.d.:1). The soil in the area is very thin and within recent times
has been extremely eroded due to overgrazing.
PALEOENVIRONMENT

The vegetation record of the lower Pecos area has been divided by Dering (1979)
into four stages; the late glacial (9,000 B.P.), early postglacial (9,000-7,000 B.P.), the
middle postglacial (7,000-3,750 B.P.), and the late postglacial (3,750 B.P. to present).
The late glacial has been characterized as a Quercus-Juniperus parkland (Dering
1979) due to the high percentages of pine and composite pollen, moderate amounts
of oak and grass pollen, and small quantities of spruce and juniper pollen observed in
pollen samples from Hinds Cave (Dering 1979). Scattered amongst this parkland
environment were the typical desert succulents; agave, soto1, and prickly pear, as is
indicated in the macroremains of Hinds Cave (Dering 1979). Since pinyon pine
macroremains were not observed in the Hinds Cave deposits during the late postgla­
cial, Dering suggested that pinyon pine groves most likely grew across the northern
half of Val Verde County, rather than occurring in a nearby canopy forest, as pre­
viously thought (Dering 1979). Bryant and Holloway (1985) have observed, mainly
from pollen samples collected from Bonfire Shelter, that "the Lower Pecos region
underwent a gradual vegetational change during the lateglacial period which cul­
minated in a reduction of forested regions" (Bryant and Holloway 1985:52).
In the early postglacial (9,000-7,000 B.P.) Dering (1979) observed pine, oak, and
composite pollen to be the main constituents of the pollen assemblages from Hinds
Cave. However, pine percentages had decreased and composite percentages in­
creased from the lateglacial samples. This indicates that the trend toward an increase
in scrub grasslands and a decrease in the parklands observed in the lateglacial was
still prevalent. Bryant and Holloway (1985) also observed a gradual decrease in the
amount of pine pollen, associated with an increase in the percentages of herbaceous
and grass pollen during this time period. Both of these data sources indicate that
pinyon pine may have decreased in the northern section of Val Verde County, possibly
leaving relict stands, which upheld the high amount of pine pollen in the atmosphere.
The middle postglacial (7,000-3,750 B.P.) corresponds to the hypsithermal (Deevey
and Flint 1957), which has been defined as a general warming trend throughout North
America. This general warming trend during the middle postglacial is also apparent
in the lower Pecos area with the presence of an increasing amount of xeric plant and
faunal material being used by the prehistoric occupants (Williams-Dean 1978; Dering

1979; Lord 1984). Bryant and Holloway (1985) also observed an increase in the
importance of plants from xeric habitats. Pinyon pine pollen frequencies declined
rapidly during this period, as arboreal pollen types were dominated by the nonar­
boreal pollen spectra, including grass and composite (Dering 1979).
The late postglacial (3,750 B.P. to present) "in southwest Texas is represented by
fossil pollen records indicating a gradual and continual trend towards increased
aridity" (Bryant and Holloway 1985:58), although a brief wet interval has been
documented around 2,500 B.P. (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During this wet interval
there was a resurgence of pinyon pine pollen observed at Bonfire Shelter and the
Devils Mouth Site (Bryant and Larson 1968; Bryant 1977). At Bonfire Shelter there
was also a large scale bison kill during this wet resurgence (Dibble and Lorrain 1968),
indicating that the climate was wet enough for the bison to move south into the lower
Pecos area. Grasslands dominated with desertic shrubs and succulents scattered
throughout the area (Dering 1979). The vertebrate paleofauna in the lower Pecos
region has changed only moderately over the last ten thousand years, and the "fauna
should therefore be considered as a modern population by 8,000 B.C." (Lord
1984:57). Differences in the lateglacial prehistoric fauna from the modern popula­
tions include the presence of extinct horse, camel, proboscideans, and bison
documented in the late Pleistocene material excavated from Bonfire Shelter (Dibble
1965; Dibble and Lorrain 1968).
REVIEW OF THE ARCHAEOLOGY

The archaeological resources of the lower Pecos area have been adversely af­
fected by relic hunters. Archaeological work began in the area in the 1930s. These
early researchers labelled the prehistoric occupants of the lower Pecos area as "Big
Bend Basketmakers" (Martin 1933) and "Texas Cave Dwellers" (Sayles 1935). Local
variants of these types were recognized, such as the "Pecos River Cave Dweller"
(which became the "Pecos River Focus") and the "Big Bend Cave Dweller" (which
became the "Chisos Focus"; Kelley et a1. 1940).
The first scientific work was conducted by The University of Texas at Fate Bell
Shelter (41VV74; Pearce and Jackson 1933; Thomas 1933) and Horseshoe Ranch
Caves (41 VV171; Butler 1948). Other excavations during this time period included
work by the Witte Museum on the Shumla Caves (Martin 1933) and Eagle Cave
(41VV167; Taylor 1949). Trench excavations of two caves on the lower Pecos River
were also conducted by the Smithsonian Institution (Setzler 1934). None of these
early excavations produced a Paleo-Indian occupational zone (older than 8,50.0 B.P.),
which is considered the time period in which the first occupants inhabited the lower
Pecos area, although Fate Bell Shelter, Eagle Cave, and the Shumla Caves have
produced occupation zones to the early Archaic (8,500-5,000 B.P.; see Table 6).
In these early excavations "tight vertical controls were not kept, and little
stratigraphic information was obtained" (Parsons 1965:5), mainly because these ex­
cavations "were conducted primarily to acquire well-preserved museum specimens"
(Shafer ms). Although these excavations are considered to have been poorly control­

INTRODUCTION I 15

led, they offered an insight into the complexity and chronology of the lower Pecos
culture, allowing for later comparisons with other archaeological materials excavated
from the area. The lithic artifacts recovered provided a strong base from which to
analyze and interpret the prehistoric chronology of the area.
Excavations were not conducted in the lower Pecos area during the 1940s because
of World War II. The planning for the Amistad International Dam began in 1958
(Collins 1969). This started archaeological survey and excavations in the lower Pecos
area after the long hiatus since the late 1930s. The Amistad Dam flooded the waters
of the Rio Grande for 80 miles and waters of the Devils and Pecos Rivers for a few
miles. During the initial survey work of the area 251 sites were observed, 80% of
which were considered endangered by the dam waters (Graham and Davis 1958).
Now there are over 300 sites which have been observed through survey in the area
(Story and Bryant 1966; Dymond 1976). Salvage excavations of sites which would be
destroyed by the dam include Centipede Cave (41 VV190) and Damp Cave
(41VV189; Epstein 1960), Coontail Spin (41VV82). Mosquito Cave (41VV215),
Zopilote Cave (41VV216), Doss Site (41VV3; Nunley et a1. 1965), Eagle Cave
(41VV167; Ross 1965), Devil's Mouth Site (41VV188; Johnson 1964; Sorrow 1968),
Conejo Shelter (Alexander 1974), Arenosa Shelter (Dibble 1967), and Nopal Terrace
Site (Sorrow 1968).
The excavation procedures for a majority of the above mentioned sites contained
no systematic collection of plant, animal, and fecal remains. Conejo Shelter, Bonfire
Shelter, and Parida Cave are exceptions. An example is the Coontail Spin Site which
contained a "thick deposit of excellently preserved perishable materials" (Shafer ms),
of which only the larger elements were collected. At other excavations only a repre­
sentative of each sample type was collected, such as one acorn from the numerous
numbers of acorns that could have been encountered during one excavation level.
The procedure for the salvage excavations of the Amistad Reservoir area was mainly
directed toward the identification and determination of a lithic chronology for the
area.
With the analyses of the lithics from the salvage excavation sites a cultural
chronology for the lower Pecos area was established. An initial chronology of the
area was first constructed by Taylor (1949) and revised by Epstein (1960) using lithic
material analyzed from Centipede and Damp Caves (Table 4). The occupational
levels of these caves did not extend into the Paleo-Indian period, and thus the
chronological sequence includes four time periods, starting at 7,000 B.C" The cul­
tural chronology observed at the Devils Mouth Site (Johnson 1964; Table 5) is similar
to that constructed from Centipede and Damp Cave material, although the lower
levels of excavation at the Devils Mouth Site include Paleo-Indian material, as
evidenced by the presence of Golondrina points.
These two early chronologies were constructed with information gained from one
or two sources. A more complete and inclusive cultural chronology of the lower
Pecos area (Thble 6), which included the lithics and radiocarbon dates from a number

dated to approximately 10,000 B.p. and contained the remains of a large number of
extinct Bison antiquus (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). The remains of an estimated 120
bison were probably driven over the cliff in front of the shelter in three separate

drives. Associated with these animals were Folsom and Plainview point types (Dib­
ble and Lorrain 1968; Dibble 1970). Bone bed III contained the remains of
approximately 800 bison, dated at approximately 2,650 B.P., and is considered to be
an accumulation of several events, rather than a single kill (Dibble and Lorrain 1968;
Dibble 1970).
Bison remains have been observed at other sites in the lower Pecos region dating
to the Paleo-Indian time period. These include extinct bison from Arenosa Shelter
(41VV99; Dibble 1967) and Cueva Quebrada (41VV162A; Lundelius 1984). The
extinct bison remains observed in the basal occupational levels of some of the lower
Pecos sites suggests that big game hunting may have been an important part of the
economy during the Paleo-Indian period, as it was in the rest of North America during
that time period. After a good cultural chronology was established for the lower
Pecos area different excavational procedures and sampling techniques were used to
gain information from other types of occupational materials. Paleoecology became
an important consideration for lower Pecos archaeologists, with the focus of research
centering on obtaining new kinds of information. Some late Amistad Reservoir
salvage excavations during the late 1960s focused on obtaining paleoecological
material. Such excavations were conducted at Parida Cave (41 VV187; Alexander
1970) and Conejo Shelter (41VV162; Alexander 1974). These excavations were the

18 / PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER C4'VE

first to systematically save coprolite material, later analyzed by Riskind (1970) and
Bryant (1969, 1974c), respectively.
Other archaeological analyses conducted in order to further the information on
lower Pecos paleoecology included extensive excavations at Hinds Cave (41VV456;
Shafer and Bryant 1977) and Baker Cave (41VV213). The main objectives of the
excavations at Hinds Cave were as follows:
1) "Secure a well-controlled sample of prehistoric human coprolites from
levels believed to be Middle Archaic."
2) "Secure a well-controlled sample of plant macrofossils."
3) "Determine the depth of the cultural deposits at the site."
4) "Conduct a preliminary environmental resource study of the area sur­
rounding the cave."
5) "Secure a controlled sample of material culture elements through excava­
tion by natural levels." (Shafer and Bryant 1977:11-12)
The extensive excavations at Hinds Cave produced thousands of bags of plant
remains and cultural material and over 1,000 human coprolites. The careful recovery
procedures conducted at Hinds and Baker Caves will allow for the continued analysis
of the prehistoric lower Pecos area long after all of the archaeological sites in the area
are gone.
The most extensive zooarchaeological analysis of the lower Pecos area is on
material from Hinds Cave (Lord 1984). In this study a total of 64 different faunal taxa
were recovered. This analysis indicated "that deer and carnivores supplied the bulk
of the meat with lagomorphs, rodents and birds supplementing the meat diet" (Lord
1984:212-213). Lord also noted that there seemed to be a shift in the diet through
time. In earlier times deer was the main item exploited with suppliments provided
mainly by lagomorphs and rodents. Between 4,800 and 4,000 B.c. there was an
increase in the amount of deer and fish observed and a decrease in the amount of
smaller, supplimental fauna. This was followed, after 4,000 B.C., by an increase in the
importance of lagomorphs, fish, and aquatic turtles to the diet.
Douglas (1970) analyzed the faunal remains excavated from Baker Cave by James
H. Word from 1962-1966. In this zooarchaeological analysis fish, lagomorphs, and
deer were the most prevalent items identified. Although deer and lagomorph fre­
quencies oscillated through the zones it was apparent that deer contributed a larger
amount to the diet of the Baker Cave occupants, as "one deer might contain as much
usable protein as 50 cottontail rabbits" (Douglas 1970:144).
The bioarchaeology of the lower Pecos area has only recently been analyzed,
mainly due to the lack of skeletal remains found in the sites. The history of bioar­
chaeological research in the area has been provided by Reinhard et al. (1989) and the
bioarchaeological data has been recently summarized by Steele and Olive (1989) and

INTRODUCTION I 19

Reinhard et al. (1991). The majority of the skeletal remains recovered from the
lower Pecos were excavated from Seminole Sink (41VV620; Turpin 1985), in which
the remains of at least 22 individuals were found and dated to the early Archaic
period. These skeletal samples indicate a "low infection rate (10-20%), os­
teoarthritis (10%), osteophytosis (20%), and trauma (10%)" (Marks et a1. 1985:150).
Dental problems included hypoplasias, high amount of caries, which suggests a high
intake of sugars and carbohydrates, and extreme dental attrition, caused by eating grit
and masticating the tough plant foods in the lower Pecos area. Other bioarchaeologi­
cal material from the lower Pecos area includes a child bundle buriaL This burial was
dated at approximately 1,000 B.C. to A.D. 1,000 by the mat construction with which
the child was buried (Banks and Rutenberg 1982). Other human skeletal material
was recovered from Coontal Spin (Benfer and McKern 1968).
Pathologies of the lower Pecos population were compared to other Texas popula­
tions - Coastal Strip, the Central Texas Prairie, and the South Texas Coastal Plains
(Reinhard et a1. 1991). This comparison indicates that the lower Pecos peoples had
a higher incidence of enamel hypoplasia, caries, antemortem tooth loss, and absces­
ses than most of the other southern Texas groups, although the frequency of
appendicular osteoarthritis and infectious diseases were lower (Reinhard et a1. 1991).
REVIEW OF COPROLITE STUDIES

Coprolite analyses have been an important aspect in determining the diet,
seasonality, and subsistence patterns of the prehistoric inhabitants of the lower Pecos
region. Coprolites are abundant in this region of Texas, especially in the dry lime­
stone rockshelters because the aridity of the environment is conducive to
preservation. Over 1,000 well-preserved coprolites were excavated from Hinds Cave
(Shafer and Bryant 1977). Of those approximately 25% have been analyzed. The
analysis of existing and possible future coprolites from the lower Pecos area is
important in providing a complete picture of lower Pecos prehistoric life. This is
especially important as uncountable numbers of coprolites have been lost as previous
excavators in the lower Pecos region tossed them into canyons during lunchbreak,
considering them unimportant (Bryant 1987).
The most comprehensive analysis of coprolites in this area includes a study of 100
coprolites from Hinds Cave conducted by Williams-Dean (1978). These samples are
dated to approximately 4,000 B.C. and reflect a diet centered around the gathering of
plant foods and foraged animal foods such as rodents, avifauna, and herpetofauna.
The main plant items recovered were fiber, epidermis, spines, and seeds of the prickly
pear cactus. Other plants identified from the samples were onion, persimmon,
hackberry, sotol, lechuguilla, and walnut. Parasites were also searched for in Dean's
study, although none were observed.
Other studies conducted on Hinds Cave (41VV456) coprolites include analyses
by Stock (1983) and Reinhard et a1. (1991). In the recent study of 25 coprolite
samples conducted by Reinhard et a1. (1991) parasites, pollen, and macroremains
were analyzed. The samples were excavated from levels dating between ap­

proximately 2,500 to 3,680 B.C. A bioarchaeological overview of the lower Pecos
Texas, in order to help determine health of the population, was also given. In this
study they observed that grass, prickly pear, hedgehog cactus, and pincushion cactus
were eaten, as well as grass, sotol, and cactus (possibly hedgehog cactus) flowers. No
parasites were observed in these samples indicating, "that either parasitism was very
rare or that the coprolites did not provide suitable conditions for the preservation of
helminth eggs" (Reinhard et a1. 1991).
The study conducted by Stock (1983) analyzed the macro remains of 55 coprolite
specimens from two different areas of occupation at Hinds Cave. Twenty-six
coprolites, with an average date of 5,286 B.C., and 29 specimens, with an average date
of 6,280 B.C., were chosen for analysis. These samples were chosen to permit a
comparison with those from Williams-Dean's study and to generalize about diet
change and subsistence of the Hinds Cave occupants through time. In Stock's
analysis it was also evident that prickly pear was the main dietary item. Other
significant dietary items included onion, persimmon, walnuts, fish, and rodents.
The analysis of 43 coprolites from Conejo Shelter (Bryant 1969, 1974c) included
information on the importance of coprolites and the types of data that can be gleaned
from such studies. These coprolites were excavated from various levels of Conejo
Shelter (41 VV162) and are dated from 500 B.c. to A.D. 800. Economic pollen types,
derived from probable flower eating included prickly-pear cactus, agave, yucca, sotol,
and lead tree. The plant macro remains showed heavy diet usage of cactus pads and
fruits, soto1, and agave leaf bases, wild onions, and monocot fibers suspected to
represent cattail. The non-plant macroremains reflected the ingestion mainly of
rodents, as well as some fish, lizards, and grasshoppers.
Macroremains (Fry 1976b) and pollen content (Bryant 1975) were analyzed from
47 coprolites recovered from Frightful Cave in Coahuila, Mexico. These samples
were divided into three groups; 15 samples dating from 7,500-5,000 B.C., 16 samples
dating from 5,000-2,000 B.c., and 16 samples dating from 2,000 B.C. to A.D. 300. The
macroremains analyzed indicated a reliance on the desert succulents, particularly
that of prickly pear. The economic pollen types observed in these samples included
prickly pear, acacia, agave, nightshade, and sotol.
An analysis of the pollen spectra from 11 coprolites excavated from Parida Cave
(41 VV187) was conducted by Riskind (1970). The coprolites were all excavated from
test pit 4 and represent many levels of occupation. In his study the economic. pollen
types identified included agave, pincushion cactus, yucca, grass, and mormon tea.
Site Description

The coprolites used for this study were excavated from Baker Cave (41VV213), a
dry rockshelter located on a high bluff in the Lower Pecos region of Val Verde
County, southwestern Texas. The cave is situated 70 m above Phillips Canyon, a dry

tributary of the Devils River. The area of the cave consists of a maximum width of 15
m, maximum length of 37 m, and an overall surface area of approximately 451.5
square meters (Word and Douglas 1970; Chadderdon 1983). The fill of Baker Cave,
which consists of spalls, limestone dust, and cultural material, is approximately 3 to
3.3 meters deep (Hester 1983). It contains occupational debris from the late Paleo­
Indian period, no earlier than 7,000 B.C. (Word and Douglas 1970; Hester 1983), but
most of the archeological material is from the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time
periods (Chadderdon 1983).
EXCAVATIONAL HISTORY

James H. Word, an avocational archeologist, conducted the first excavations of
Baker Cave from 1962-1966 (Word and Douglas 1970), followed in 1968 by a graduate
student at the University of Texas, John W. Greer (1968). In 1976 Thomas R. Hester
and Robert F. Heizer conducted excavations at the site (Hester 1983; Chadderdon
1983), and the cave was most recently excavated under the direction of Thomas R.
Hester, James Word, and Kenneth M. Brown during the 1984 field season and
Kenneth M. Brown during the 1985 field season (Brown n.d.; Hester 1986). The
coprolites analyzed for this study were recovered during the 1984 season.
In the excavations conducted by James Word from 1962-1966 an abundant array
of artifacts was recovered. The most common artifacts observed in the deposits
consisted of knotted fibers (943), primarily lechuguilla, sotol, and sacahuista (Word
and Douglas 1970). Other recovered artifacts included woven basket fragments,
bone tools, 33 fragmentary sandals, pendants, pigments, manos, a three-layered stack
of prickly pear internodes tied with sacahuista fiber (Feature No.3), and various
lithics and flakes. Based upon the lithic artifacts collected the chronology was
divided into six periods (Word and Douglas 1970).
Period 1 (7,500-6,500 B.C.) was established as a Paleo-Indian occupation due to
the presence of Plainview Golondrina points (one complete and five fragmentary;
later termed Gonondrina points), and early radiocarbon dates of 6,969 B.C. and 7,080
B.C. (Word and Douglas 1970). Other diagnostic traits included bifacial knives,
choppers, scrapers, and utilized flakes (Word and Douglas 1970).
Period 2 (6,500-4,000 B.C.) was delineated due to the abundance of Bandy points,
and the contemporaneous Baker and Early Barbed points. The dart point style also
changed in this period, from a lanceolate form (Paleo-Indian style) to a stemmed,
barbed form (Archaic style; Word and Douglas 1970).
Period 3 (4,000-2,500 B.c.) was characterized by the increase in the usage of
fiber, in articles such as sandles, and the presence of Pandale, Langtry I, and Tortugas
lithic points.
Period 4 (2,500-1,000 B.C.) showed an increase in the variety of sandals, and the
dominant lithic artifacts include the Langtry and Val Verde points. The first ulna
fIakers also appeared during this time period (Word and Douglas 1970).

22 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER C4VE

Period 5 (1,000 B.C.-A.D. 1,000) represented a greater variety and diversity of
fibrous artifacts, bone tools, grinding slabs, and lithics than previous periods. The
main lithic artifacts included side-notched Ensor and corner-notched Marshall, Mon­
tell, and Castroville points. At the end of this time period, approximately A.D. 1,000,
the bow and arrow was introduced into the region (Shafer 1981).
Period 6 occupation was tenuously assigned, with only 13 points being found.
Word and Douglas postulated "a transitory occupation of the cave during this time
period" (Word and Douglas 1970:103). This excavation area was observed on the
surface of the site matrix, which contained two to three inches of accumulated sheep
dung (Word and Douglas 1970), indicating that this level was disturbed and churned.
The excavations conducted by Greer (1968) and Hester and Heizer (Chadderdon
1983; Hester 1983) generally confirmed the periods observed by Word and Douglas
(1970). Greer (1968) conducted excavations that abutted the areas dug by Word.
Greer observed Pandale points dating at approximately 2,600 B.C. and a Golondrina
point base found 0.3 m above bedrock (Greer 1968). A cooking pit, or sealed hearth,
covered with ash and a domed pile of burned rock (Hester 1983) was in the
Golondrina zone. This feature contained the remains of a variety of plants (16
different species), such as walnut and Texas mountain laurel seed fragments, most of
which ripen in the fall (Chadderdon 1983). Mammal remains predominantly of
cottontail rabbits, squirrels, mice, gophers, and rats were observed, as well as 23
reptile and six fish species (Hester 1983). Sotol and lechuguilla, prevalent plant
items in the later time periods, were not observed in this earlier Golondrina zone
(Hester 1983).
During the 1984-1985 field seasons at Baker Cave, at the south end of the cave,
four major phases of space usage were noted by Brown (n.d.). Light, intermittent
occupations occurred during the late Paleo-Indian period, in which occupational
debris and artifacts were scarce. In a later period a large area contained intrusive,
superimposed pits, possibly used for cooking. Over this churned area a 50-60 em
deposit containing massive amounts of fiberous debris were excavated. Due to the
amount of churning, pit digging, and fiberous materials, the stratigraphy in this area
was not easily recognized (Brown n.d.). The most significant find of these two
seasons was a possible intact occupational floor. Features associated with this floor
area include two upright sotol pegs, cut lechuguilla leaves (possibly indicating a
lechuguilla processing area), and a series of grass-lined pits (Brown n.d.). The last
phase of space usage, according to Brown, included the upper surface levels, which
show only slight occupations areas, mainly along the back areas of the cave (Brown
n.d.).
THE PRESENT STUDY

The coprolites analyzed for this study were found in a buried latrine area near the
entrance to Baker Cave (Fig. 2) in unit N6/E9, stratum 2. Samples 1 and 2 from the
latrine area were mapped at elevation 98.37 m and are tentatively considered to be a
part of the intact occupation floor found 10-20 em below the surface that extends for

at least 5 m2 over the area of excavation (Brown n.d.). Feature 84-3, from this
occupation floor at grids N3/E8 and N3/E9, was a large grass-lined pit at least 30 em
deep. This feature contained bundles of green sotol flower stalks which radiated
from the center of the pit to the outside rim, where they were bent down over the rim.
These sotol stalks were then covered with a thick layer of grass (Brown n.d.). The
green sotol flower stalks were radiocarbon dated to 1,100 B.P., falling within the Late
Archaic/Late Prehistoric time period. Since the latrine area has been tentatively
placed within the same living floor as feature 84-3, the coprolites are considered to
date to the same time period (Ken Brown 1988, personal communication).
The importance of the analysis of the coprolites from Baker Cave is three-fold.
First, this analysis will provide additional dietary data on prehistoric lower Pecos
populations. Baker Cave, although occupying the same lower Pecos area, is situated
in a more mesic biological environment from that of the rockshelters examined in
previous studies. This added information obtained from the Baker Cave coprolites
will contribute to a richer understanding of overall diet adequacy; a question which
now needs attention due to the new accumulation of osteological information from
the area. Second, the addition of dietary information from the Baker Cave coprolites,
dated at approximately A.D. 900, will provide knowledge of dietary habits associated
with a more recent period in time. The time span covered by previous coprolite
studies from the lower Pecos area is 7,500 B.C. to A.D. 500. Third, the study will
include a nutritional analysis of the samples which will be the first of its kind
conducted on an actual sample of coprolites. Nutritional analyses of dietary informa­
tion has only been cursorily covered for other coprolite studies conducted in the area.
The most extensive nutritional analysis of the area to date (Winkler 1982) included a
review of ethnobotanical and coprolite research in the lower Pecos area as well as
some nutritional values of a few of the botanical dietary items recovered.

CHAPTER II
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Excavations at Baker Cave have produced a large amount of plant and animal
material, as well as two possible sheet latrine areas (Brown 1986), a definite latrine
deposit, and assorted coprolite specimens. The two sheet latrines cannot be
separated into singular samples due to the nature of the material, and the assorted
coprolite specimens are few in number and were excavated from various locations in
the habitational matrix. The definite latrine deposit was chosen for this analysis
because it most likely represents deposition of material during a single occupation,
unlike the random specimens, and specific samples can usually be ascertained, unlike
the sheet latrine areas where individual coprolites cannot be distinguished. The
sample consists of 38 specimens excavated from this latrine area; however, all of
these do not necessarily reflect a single, whole coprolite. Upon excavation of the
latrine area, some of the specimens could not be distinguished from one another and
were taken out in chunks. In this analysis the 38 specimens will be referred to as
coprolites, although this distinction may not always be the case.
Laboratory Procedures
The coprolite specimens analyzed were first photographed with color film to
show and preserve a record of external features. The exterior of each coprolite was
then scraped carefully to remove any contaminated material, such as rocks, plant
debris, and cave dirt, and the samples were weighed (Table 7). One-half of each
coprolite, except in cases where the coprolite weighed less than 10 grams, were used
for analysis, and the sample weight used was recorded (Table 7). Any external and
internal features of the coprolite samples also were noted. The samples were halved
to preserve part of the sample for future analyses. The excess sample may, however,
be used to obtain a good radiocarbon date of the latrine. The samples were then
placed in a 0.5% tri-sodium phosphate mixture for at least 48 hours according to the
method described by Callen and Cameron (1960). At this time one tablet of an exotic
marker (Lycopodium spores 11,300±400 spores) per gram of sample weight was
added in order to calculate overall pollen concentration (Table 7).
During the rehydration step the samples were observed for color c~ange, scum
formation, and odor, which are discussed in the observations section of this chapter.
After the samples had broken apart they were subsequently screened through 850 and
250 micrometer mesh screens. Thirty percent ethanol was sprayed onto the samples
in order to break the surface tension of the water and prevent pollen or endoparasites
from being caught on the screen. The debris that passed through the micrometer
mesh screens were allowed to settle for at least three hours. The water was then
siphoned off leaving the heavy sedimentation, which contained the pollen and en­
doparasite material.

PARASITES

At this time subsamples of the fluid material from fourteen of the coprolites
(Samples 1, 3-9, 12, 17, and 20-23) were taken in order to analyze for endoparasites.
The parasite analysis was conducted by Karl J. Reinhard, Department of Anthropol­
ogy, Texas A&M University. The technique used for the parasite analysis involved a
simple sedimentation technique which allows for the retention of fragile parasite
eggs, without undo damage. The subsamples were concentrated with the use of a
centrifuge and placed into vials in a solution of acetic formalin alcohol (AFA), which
prevents fungal and bacterial growth. The material was allowed to settle by gravita­
tion. Once settled the upper portion was pipetted off. Microscopic slide
preparations in glycerol were made from this upper sediment material, and the slides
were scanned at 400X on a stereoscopic microscope for possible parasitic remains.
POLLEN

The heavy sedimentation material that was left after the screening step was
prcessed for pollen. Chemical extraction techniques were used in order to remove
organic debris and silicates. The steps used for pollen extraction are listed in Table
8. They include the softening of cellulose material with 10% potassium hydroxide
(KOH) and its subsequent removal, along with the organic material, during acetolysis
(9 parts acetic anhydride to 1 part sulfuric acid). Heavy density separation was
conducted with zinc chloride in order to remove silicates. The material remaining
was placed in vials with glycerol and mounted on slides for pollen identification.
Pollen identifications were made with the aid of the pollen reference collection
at Texas A&M University and with Kapp's (1969) How to Know Pollen and Spores.
Identifications were usually made at the 400X level on a compound stereoscopic
microscope. The pollen recovered from the 38 coprolites were counted until a count
of at least 200 grains was reached which is considered a statistically valid (Barkley
1935). Pollen grains that were crumpled, crushed, broken, or degraded beyond
recognition were labelled indeterminants and included in the total pollen sum (Cush­
ing 1967). A few of the grains were labelled as unknown if identifications could not
be established. These were also included in the total pollen sum. A modern control
soil sample was also processed and counted to determine which pollen types are
found naturally in the environment. The results of the identification of pollen from
the coprolite samples and the modern sample were tabulated in a pollen frequency
diagram which is included in Chapter 3.
MACROREMAINS

After the rehydrated samples were screened through 850 and 250 micrometer
mesh screens, the remains which were caught in the screens were placed on filter
paper to dry thoroughly. This drying process lasted from three days to one week. The
samples were then folded in the filter paper and placed in sealed plastic bags until
they could be analyzed. During analysis the samples were placed on large, white
sheets of paper under a macroscope and sorted, usually at lOX or 20X magnification.

Identifications were made using the seed reference collection at Texas A&M Univer­
sity and the seed manual by Martin and Barkley (1973).
Remains of which I had little knowledge were sent to specialists for identification.
These included the insect remains which were identified by Richard Blume, Bryan,
Texas, the fish scales which were sent to David J. Lee, Department of Wildlife and
Fisheries, Texas A&M University, and the bird feathers which were sent to Keith
Arnold, Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, Texas A&M University.
Observations
COLOR

The coprolite specimens were determined to be human in origin due to color,
odor, and contents. The color of human coprolites in the reconstituting tri-sodium
phosphate liquid have been observed to be black (Callen and Cameron 1955) or dark
brown (Fry 1968). Fry (1970) has also observed that the dried feces ofthe coatimundi
(Nasua nasua) also will turn the rehydrating solution black or dark brown.
Carnivore coprolites tend to turn the tri-sodium phosphate solution white or
yellow-brown and herbivores light yellow or light brown (Bryant 1986). In studies on
modern feces Williams-Dean (1978) has observed that fresh human feces need to be
dried before they will turn the reconstituting liquid a dark brown or black color. All
of the Baker Cave coprolites turned a medium brown to black color in the reconstitu­
tion liquid.
ODOR

Bryant (1986) observed that nonhuman coprolites tend to produce a slight musty
odor in comparison to human coprolites which produce a noticeable "odor" upon
reconstitution (Fry 1968). Fecal material odor is associated with the putrification
processes that bacteria perform in the intestines, the production of two main
aromatic chemicals, 3-methyl indole and skatol (Callen 1967a; Fry 1985). A larger
amount of biproducts are produced from these putrification process when high
amounts of meat protein are eaten (emitting a stronger odor), whereas a smaller
amount of biproducts are produced when high amounts of plant material is consumed
(emitting a slight odor; Reitman 1963).
The Baker Cave coprolites had a slight odor upon reconstitution, while a few of
them were recorded as "raunchy." The slight odor of the Baker Cave samples most
likely reflects the high vegetal diet. Therefore, odor may help determine human from
nonhuman coprolites, but also most likely reflects the differences in diet content.
SURFACE FILM

The presence of surface film in rehydrating coprolite samples has been attributed
to a diet composed of vegetal products and meat (Callen 1967a). Bryant and Weir
(n.d.), in their study of human coprolites from Ayacucho, Peru, made a careful

30 / PREHISTORIC DIETAT BAKER CAVE

analysis of the presence of surface film and coprolite contents. They found that the
presence or absence of surface film did not correlate, as Callen suggested, with any
specific groups of diet components. Using the same slide specimens of the surface
film as did Callen from the Tehuacan samples, Williams-Dean (1978) instead iden­
tified the material as containing mostly unidentifiable material and phytolith plant
debris. This surface film was observed on the majority of the rehydrating solution of
coprolites from Hinds Cave (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983) and with the present
Baker Cave samples.
Quantification
MICROREMAINS

As stated above, the pollen was counted to at least a 200 grain count. The
Lycopodium grains observed were also counted, although they were added separately
from the total pollen sum. Concentration values for each coprolite were calculated
using the amount of Lycopodium grains added, times the amount of fossil grains
counted, divided by the amount of Lycopodium grains counted, times the amount of
sediment processed. This information for each of the coprolite samples is included
in Table 7. A complete discussion on the importance of pollen concentration value
to coprolite studies is included in Chapter 3.
MAC ROREMAINS

The quantification of plant remains is a significant problem in the identification
of archaeobotanical materials. The main reason for this is that no papers have been
written and published on a comparison of the different procedures for quantifying
archaeological remains and assessing their strengths and weaknesses. There are
almost as many different quantification techniques as there are analysts. This can be
demonstrated by listing some of the different techniques used in quantifying
coprolite constituents. For an extensive review of the different quantification tech­
niques employed by coprolite analysts see Williams-Dean (1978).
Initially researchers used presence/absence (Smith and Jones 1910; Young 1910;
Callen 1955; Riskind 1970; Clary 1975), nicknamed the "grocery list" procedure.
Other methods used included analyzing the different constituents by weight (Hall
1972; Stewart 1974; Fry and Hall 1975; Aasen 1984; Reinhard et al. 1991), percent
volume (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983), percent subjective (Yarnell 1969; Bryant
1974c), and counting the items, a method which seems to accompany other quan­
tification techniques (Fry and Hall 1973; Aasen 1984). The following analysis of the
different quantification techniques used in paleoethnobotanical studies uses obser­
vations from experiments conducted by paleoethnobotanical classes at Texas A&M
University.

MATERIALSANDMETHODS I 31

Percentage Weight Method

In this method all of the constituents in the coprolite are separated out and
weighted. The initial problem with this method is that it is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to separate out all components of the coprolite, such as dirt and sand from
calcium oxylate crystals. Other drawbacks of this quantification method are obvious;
it underestimates the lighter contents, such as fiber, leaves, and fur, and overes­
timates the heavier contents, such as rocks and bone. Thus, this method incurs biases
in the sample.
The positive aspects of this method, however, may outweigh the drawbacks for
some investigators. The weight technique is the most used method for quantification,
thus making any analyses conducted with this method easier to compare with other
studies. This technique is also "more scientific," meaning the data can be manipu­
lated statistically.
Percentage Count of Total

The drawbacks of this technique are very similar to that for weight. Again, it is
almost impossible to count the fine debris, such as sand, dirt, and calcium oxylate
crystals. This method also tends to underestimate constituents which are not easily
broken, such as rocks, and overestimates those constituents which are easily broken
or contain more fragments to begin with, such as fiber particles, charcoal, and other
fine debris. This technique, however, is useful in that it provides a secondary quan­
tification method which is not time consuming and is relatively easy to accomplish,
reinforcing the primary method chosen.
Percentage Volume

In this quantification method, all material from the coprolites are separated and
placed into similar containers. The number of containers each constituent fills is
them compared to the total. This technique is fairly sufficient in estimating the
amount of each item in a sample, although this method is very cumbersome and
unexact. It is almost impossible to get the items into the same sized containers for
analysis. Some material is too large to fit into smaller containers for an exact
comparison, such as medium to large bone pieces and rocks. It is also impossible to
compress such items as bone and larvae encasings down into a container for an
accurate measurement. This method, thus, uses more "guestimation" than other
quantification methods employed. This technique is also not widely used in archaeol­
ogy, making comparisons difficult.
Percent Subjective

This quantification technique aligns all of the constituents in their proper order,
from most frequent to least frequent, which are then placed into pre-set percentage
groups. These percentage groups provide a range of error, without any bias' being
introduced. Each constituent is placed into these different percentage groups when
the sample is being sorted and separated. This technique is the least time consuming
and most cost efficient, and does not provide the drawbacks of the other quantifica­

.. ~~~~-~~ .....-

32 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER CAVE

tion techniques. The percent subjective method does not overestimate the larger
items, or items which are broken into numerous pieces. Also, all of the constituents
of the sample do not have to be separated in order to make an accurate measurement,
allowing sand and calcium oxylate crystals to be quantified accurately.
The problems with this technique are two-fold; it is not a "strictly scientific"
method and thus the data cannot be manipulated with statistics, and this technique is
also not widely used. Both of these problems make comparisons with other coprolite
studies difficult.
SECTION SUMMARY

There are inherent problems and positive aspects in all of the above quantifica­
tion techniques. This is the main reason why there is no universally accepted method
of archaeobotanical quantification. Each study conducted has different aspects that
will help the analyst decide on which method to use. If the analyst is trying to do a
comparison study then the quantification techniques used should match those of the
study that is being compared, as with Janet Stock's thesis (1983). However, if the
analyst feels strongly that the method used was inappropriate and introduced strong
biases then that technique should not be used. A researcher should only use those
methods that they feel are appropriate and can be justified.
In this study of the coprolites from Baker Cave, the percent subjective technique
is the method chosen for quantification because it is the easiest and introduces the
least amount of bias into the sample. Coprolite analyses are already full of inherent
bias' without more being introduced through the techniques of the analyst. The
different quantification groups used in this study are listed in Table 9. A second
quantification technique, the weight method, is also used in this study for compara­
tive purposes and for any future statistical analyses. These weights, however, will not
be discussed in the text and are only listed in the appendix, due to the bias' such a
method introduces in the analysis.

MICROREMAINS
Pollen and parasite analyses of coprolites are unique studies which offer a diver­
sity of information on prehistoric populations and subsistence practices. Both of
these analyses can determine aspects of a prehistoric population that cannot be
determined through the sole analysis of the macroremains of coprolites. The pollen
content can help determine diet, seasonality of site occupation, and paleoenviron­
ment (Bryant 1974a), whereas an analysis of parasite content can help determine the
health of a population or hygienic practices (Fry 1985). Both of these research
techniques have been conducted on many samples of prehistoric fecal material,
although different coprolite analysts place a greater importance on one or the other
analytical procedure.
Pollen

Pollen is observed and analyzed from many sample types. Such diverse uses for
pollen identification include the analysis of honey content (melissopalynology) in
order to determine quality (Moore and Webb 1978), the reconstruction of paleoen­
vironment (Dimbleby 1985), the dating of archaeological deposits (Dimbleby 1985),
and the determination of paleodiet (Martin and Sharrock 1964). Pollen is useful in a
wide range of areas due to its prevalence in the environment and its distinctive, sturdy
structure.
Pollen has a sturdy structure due to its exine (outer layer) which is composed
partly of sporopollenin, a strong, resistant substance (Shaw 1971; Stanley and
Linskens 1974). The inner layer of pollen, intine, consists of cellulose, which is easily
degraded after a short length of time. When the cellulose layer of the intine is
degraded, only the outer layer containing sporopollenin remains. However, this layer
is often sufficient for identification because the exine contains distinct sculpturing
patterns and aperture shapes, allowing pollen identification to be made to the species
level in some instances (Kapp 1969; Moore and Webb 1978). Holloway (1981)
conducted extensive experiments on the degradation of pollen grains, recording
different causes of pollen degradation, such as temperature, moisture, pH, mechani­
cal action, and fungal organisms. He also observed that the different ratios of
sporopollenin and cellulose in the exine of a pollen grain affected preservation
(Holloway 1981).
As stated above, the exine contains distinct identifiable structures; apertures and
sculpturing patterns. An aperture has been defined as "any thin or missing part of the
exine which is independent of the pattern of the exine" (Moore and Webb 1978:35).
Apertures are considered the exit region for the pollen tubule which will extend to
the ovule, as well as a repository for proteins, which may aid in the identification

process between the stigma and the pollen grain (Moore and Webb 1978). Aperture
types consist of colpi, long furrows in the exine, or pores, circular holes in the exine.
These different aperture types are observed in a variety of numbers and locations on
pollen grains, depending on the specific taxa.
Pollen can become ingested and remain undamaged, and thus observed in
coprolites. This can occur through the intentional eating of flowers or seeds or
through the unintentional ingestion of pollen in medicinal teas or foods, in which
pollen is adhering to the plant. Pollen in this context is considered economic because
it was actually associated with food or a medicinal item. Pollen may also become
ingested during respiration and contaminated food and water supplies, especially if
the food is prepared in an open area (Bryant 1974c) as in a cave situation. This can
be especially prevalent during the pollinating season of a specific plant, such as pine
and oak in the spring or ragweed and juniper in the fall. Pollen in this context is
considered background because the pollen was accidentally ingested and was not
associated with a particular food or medicinal item.
Pollen analyses of coprolites may provide information about prehistoric popula­
tions that macroanalyses cannot provide. If a flower type is frequently ingested, the
soft flower parts will most likely be digested. Pollen, however, will pass through the
digestive tract and become part of a coprolite, carrying with it the information of
flower ingestion. Seeds, such as Chenopodium (goosefoot), with pollen attached to
their outer surfaces, may also be eaten, and the indigestible seed parts will be
excreted soon after ingestion. Pollen of certain taxa, however, may be excreted for
up to one month after ingestion (Kelso 1976; Williams-Dean 1978), allowing for the
identification of the possible usage of that seed type.
POLLEN DIAGRAM

The pollen spectra from the Baker Cave coprolites have been diagrammed (Fig.
3). This pollen frequency diagram shows the amount and types of pollen recovered
from the 38 coprolite samples. Forty-nine pollen types were observed in the
coprolites. The common names (Correll and Johnston 1970) of the plants which
produced pollen in the samples are listed in Table 10. The highest percentage of each
pollen taxa observed in the samples above 5% is shown at the top of the diagram,
directly below the different pollen taxa listings. The highest percentage markers are
also included as a scale for the diagram. Most of the pollen taxa were observed at
frequencies less than 30%, although taxa observed at higher frequencies are indi­
cated by jagged lines, and the percentage recorded to the right of the jagge,d area.
Pollen aggregates are indicated on the diagram with a small case "a."
Samples 22 and 25 were considered invalid counts, and were not included in the
pollen diagram, because they yielded ponen counts of less than 200 grains per sample
and had a pollen concentration less than 1,000 pollen grains per gram of material.
Sample 27 produced a viable count although all of the grains were unidentifiable and
labeled as "ghost grains." "Ghost grain" is a term used to describe pollen grains in
which the external exine sculpturing has been eroded or degraded beyond recogni­

tion and identification (Bryant and Schoenwetter 1987). Due to this eroding effect
the grains have no remaining distinctive features and are almost transparent. This
sample was also not included in the pollen diagram.
On the diagram the pollen types are divided into insect pollinated plants
(zoophilous) and wind pollinated plants (anemophilous). Insect pollinated plants
produce few pollen grains and are usually insect specific to insure a high rate of
pollination. Insect pollinated plants generally produce fewer than 10,000 pollen
grains per anther (Faegri and Iversen 1964). These pollen types are rarely observed
in the pollen record due to their decreased occurrence in nature and method of
pollination. Wind pollinated plants, on the other hand, produce large amounts of
pollen to insure pollination and are frequently found in the pollen record. An
example of how enormous the quantity of pollen produced by some plants is seen in
the study conducted by Mack and Bryant (1974) where they found Pinus pollen
percentages over 50% in areas where the nearest pine tree is more than one hundred
miles away. Faegri and Iversen (1964) state that an average pine can produce ap­
proximately 350 million pollen grains per tree.
In coprolite analyses this division between pollination types is essential to record
because a high frequency of wind pollinated pollen types in a sample may not indicate
diet, but rather accidental ingestion from contaminated food andlor water supplies.
A high frequency of insect pollinated pollen types, however, often indicates the
intentional ingestion of food containing pollen (economic pollen) due to the unlikely
possibility that many grains of this type are accidental contaminants. Pollen is inten­
tionally ingested by eating flowers and certain seed types which still have pollen
attached. Bryant (1975) has shown from field experiments that for some of the
common insect pollinated types in the lower Pecos region a frequency greater than
2% in a coprolite suggests a strong possibility of intentional ingestion, and that a
frequency of 10% should be interpreted as positive evidence of intentional ingestion.
CONCENTRATION ANALYSIS

Concentration values for each coprolite were calculated using the number of
Lycopodium spores added times the amount of fossil grains counted divided by the
amount of Lycopodium spores counted times the amount of sediment processed. This
information for each of the coprolite samples is included in Table 7. The concentra­
tion values obtained from the samples were then placed into groupings listed in Table
7. Each sample's concentration grouping is also shown on the pollen frequency
diagram (Fig. 3).
Determining concentration values has not been attempted in many coprolite
studies but is important in determining which pollen types were most likely ingested.
Studies show that after ingestion, pollen can be excreted for many days as the grains
become caught in the intestinal folds. Experiments (Kelso 1976; Williams-Dean
1978) have shown that the concentration of intentionally ingested pollen can vary
considerably in sequentially produced fecal samples. Selected data on modern fecal
pollen percentages taken from a study conducted by Williams-Dean (1978) are shown

38 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER CAVE

in Figure 4. This graph illustrates the modern fecal output of one person over a
period of 32 days. Brassicaceae pollen (broccoli) was eaten at the beginning of the
study, and Prosopis (mesquite) pollen was eaten on day 11.
In Figure 4 the Brassicaceae pollen shows an immediate peak after ingestion at
almost 100%. This peak slowly decreases until the pollen is absent entirely from the
samples 32 days after first ingestion. Prosopis also shows an immediate peak after
ingestion up to 95%. This peak, however, decreases rapidly until Prosopis pollen is
no longer observed in the samples only 11 days after ingestion. Thus, this experiment
initially shows that different pollen taxa are eliminated from the digestive system at
different rates.
Brassicaceae pollen is an extremely small grain with an average size of 12 urn, and
has a finely defined outer wall sculpturing pattern. Both traits would most likely
increase the retention of this pollen type in the folds of the intestine, allowing for this
pollen type to be observed in many fecal samples after ingestion. Prosopis pollen is a
spherical, medium sized grain (average size 30 um), with a smooth exine sculpturing
pattern. The larger size of this grain and the decreased resistance provided by the
smooth exine would allow for this pollen type to pass more quickly through the
intestinal folds without retention.
From this experiment it is predicted that larger pollen grains, such as corn (Zea)
and cactus (Cactaceae), and pollen with little exine sculpturing, such as juniper
(Juniperus), will move quickly through the human digestive system. Thus, these
pollen types would be observed in fewer sequential fecal samples than those of other
types. Smaller pollen grains with significant exine sculpturing, such as sunflower
(high-spine Aste race ae ), are predicted to move more slowly through the digestive
system, being caught in the intestinal lumen, and to be last observed in fecal samples
many days after the initial ingestion.
The pollen curves observed for Brassicaceae and Prosopis in Figure 4 can be
divided into curve areas. Curve area A represents the initial peak of Brassicaceae at
frequencies almost up to 100%, and the peak of Prosopis from days 13 through 17 at
a high of 95 %. This curve area A represents the higher frequency peaks that a pollen
type attains and is usually observed in the first few days after pollen ingestion. In
coprolites, economic pollen types in this area of the pollen curve will most likely be
recognized as evidence of dietary items.
Curve area B (Fig. 4) is the medium frequency range of the pollen peak. This
curve area represents the time period when the pollen has not been ingested recently
and the frequency is no longer at its maximum, but is declining. Economic pollen
types in this curve area may be recognized as dietary items, especially if the pollen
type is zoophilous. The low economic pollen percentages observed in curve area C
(Fig. 4) make this the most difficult area in which ingested pollen types can be
recognized. For example, if Brassicaceae pollen were ingested on the first day and
the researcher analyzed a coprolite sample produced on day 31 after ingestion, this

pollen type would most likely not be recognized as an economic pollen type. Thus,
even though pollen may be observed at low frequencies in a sample, it does not
unequivocally mean that this pollen type was not ingested earlier as a dietary item.
Modern fecal experiments also show that after the ingestion of a pollen type, the
pollen count is immediately flooded with that taxa (curve area A). With the ingestion
of Prosopis pollen on day 11 (Fig. 4) and its subsequent flood of the pollen count,
Brassicaceae pollen is not observed in the pollen count until after most of the
Prosopis pollen has been eliminated from the system. This shows that with the initial
ingestion of one pollen type and its immediate percentage increase, other economic
pollen types may be obscured. Thus, even though one sample may contain 98%
Brassicaceae pollen, it does not necessarily mean that Brassicaceae pollen was the
only economic pollen type recently ingested.
The groupings of the pollen concentration values of the Baker Cave coprolites
(Table 11), with the addition of concentration information studies conducted by
Aasen (1984) and Reinhard (in press; Reinhard et a1. 1991) show an apparent trend
in the concentration values of coprolites. Coprolite samples which contain pollen
concentrations of over 100,000 pollen grains/gram of material, groups 1 and 2 in Table
11, contain relatively few pollen taxa. These taxa also tend to be the economic, or
intentionally ingested pollen types, as they are the easiest to recognize. The main
pollen taxa observed in these concentration value groups are probably pollen which
corresponds to curve area A in Figure 4, or pollen which may have been recently
ingested and is at its pollen output peak. The samples which have concentration
values below 100,000 pollen grains/gram of material, groups 3 through 5 in Table 11,
usually contain many taxa groups. These taxa can be economic pollen types which are
either not at their pollen output peak (represented by curve areas Band C in Figure
4) or are background, or unintentionally ingested pollen types.

Economic Pollen

Although any of the pollen types observed in the pollen frequency diagram (Fig.
3) actually may have been ingested as a food source by the Baker Cave occupants,
only a few are easily identified as economic, due to the problems discussed in the
concentration analysis section. The economic pollen types discussed here include
Brassicaceae (mustard family), Artemisia (sagebrush), and Gramineae (grass family).
Other pollen types discussed in this section which may be economic include
Dasylirion (sotol), high-spine Asteraceae (sunflower family), Typha (cattail), Ephedra
(mormon tea), and Lamiaceae (mint family). These pollen taxa are not as easily
recognized as being economic and may include pollen which has been accidentally
ingested (background) or pollen which was ingested many days before sample deposi­
tion.
BRASSICACEAE

Eight coprolite samples from the Baker Cave latrine area contained over 100,000
pollen grains per gram of material and were placed into pollen concentration groups
1 and 2 (Table 11). Samples from these groups most likely represent sample deposi­
tion when the economic pollen frequency output was at its peak (curve area A).
Seven of these samples contained extremely high percentages of Brassicaceae (mus­
tard family) pollen observed at frequencies over 90% in six of the samples and 28%
in the last. Figure 5 is a scanning electron micrograph showing the high amount and
clumping of Brassicaceae pollen observed in the sample.
Pollen grains in the family Brassicaceae cannot be distinguished easily into in­
dividual genera or species. As stated above in the concentration analysis section,
most Brassicaceae are small (approximately 10-25 urn), insect-pollinated, tricolpate
grains which have a light reticulate exine sculpturing pattern. Pollen from this family
has not been observed in high amounts from other coprolite samples from the lower
Pecos area, although Virginia peppergrass (Lepidium virginicum) and tansy mustard
(Descurainia) , from the Brassicaceae family grow in the area today (Smith and
Butterwick 1975).
Due to the high concentration of Brassicaceae pollen in the coprolites and since
Brassicaceae plants are insect pollinated, flowers or seeds from this family were most
likely eaten. Such high percentages of Brassicaceae pollen in these samples may be
obscuring other economic pollen types as was observed in Figure 4 with Prosopis. In
an attempt to eliminate this possible problem all of these samples were counted
above 200 grains, many to counts above 1,000 (Table 11). No other economic pollen
types were observed wi th this method.
Brassicaceae was also found at high frequencies in many samples from concentra­
tion groups 3, 4, and 5, although not as high as those included in concentration groups
1 and 2 (98-99%). This pollen type was observed at frequencies from these groups as
high as 48%, 34%, and 30%. These samples indicate that Brassicaceae pollen was
most likely ingested many days before the sample was deposited, represented most

likely by curve area B (Fig. 4). Some coprolite samples contained less than 10%
Brassicaceae pollen. If Brassicaceae pollen was eaten, these samples may have been
deposited up to one month after the pollen was ingested, represented by curve area
C (Fig. 4). Low frequencies of Brassicaceae pollen may also indicate that some other
pollen type, recently ingested at the time of deposition, may be overriding the
Brassicaceae. An example of this may be sample 7 which contains 77%Artemisia and
2% Brassicaceae pollen.
Possible uses for Brassicaceae by early cultures, such as the prehistoric Baker
Cave inhabitants, are cited in early ethnographic reports of other groups. Plants of
the Brassicaceae family were used to induce vomiting by early American explorers
and settlers (Fielder 1975). The Hopi ate the greens as a type of "salad" in the spring
(Whiting 1939). The seeds were eaten and used as a stomach medicine by the Ramah
Navaho (Vestal 1952), and the Meskwakis used this plant as snuff for colds (Vogel
1973). Brassicaceae seeds were also used as seasoning by various North American
Indian groups (Yanovsky 1936).
ARTEMISIA

Sample 8, the last coprolite sample containing over 100,000 pollen grains per
gram of material and in pollen concentration group 2 (Table 11), exhibited 70%
Artemisia (sagebrush) pollen. Artemisia was also observed at high frequencies, 55%
and 77%, in some samples from pollen concentration groups 3 and 4. Artemisia is in
the Asteraceae family, is wind-pollinated, and is distinguished in the fossil record
mainly by its thick exine. The grains are tricolporate with a microechinate
sculpturing pattern that includes short, tiny spines of less than 1 urn in length.
Artemisia is not observed in the Baker Cave vicinity today, although it is found in the
southwestern Texas area, particularly to the south and west. This may indicate that
the Baker Cave inhabitants were traveling away from the cave in their subsistence
rounds (Ken Brown 1988, personal communication).
Since Artemisia is wind pollinated, the pollen could be expected at a higher
frequency in the samples, especially during the fall pollinating season. Bryant (1975)
states, using low-spine asters as an example, that a frequency of up to 40%
anemophilous (wind pollinated) pollen can be expected in a sample. Artemisia pollen
is observed at a frequency higher than this indicating this plant type as a probable
food source. The samples also contained clumps of Artemisia (indicated by a small
case "a" in Figure 3) suggesting the ingestion of anthers. As with Brassicaceae this
pollen type was not observed in high frequencies in other samples from this area,
although Holloway (1983) observed sagebrush pollen at high frequencies in
coprolites from Caldwell Cave, Culberson County, in west Texas.
Possible uses for Artemisia include ingestion as an herb (Sturtevant 1972), in teas
to cure coughing and indigestion, as part of a "salad," by eating the seeds, or by using
the leaves as a fumigant as exemplified by the Ramah Navaho (Vestal 1952), the Hopi
(Whiting 1939), and the Tewa (Burlage 1968). The Arikara and Rappahannocks
women also used sagebrush in teas to control or relieve menstrual pain (Vogel 1973).

GRAMINEAE

Gramineae (grass) pollen has a distinct spherical shape with a single annulate
pore. The surface sculpturing pattern is faintly granular or indistinctly verrucate, and
the average size range is from 20 urn to 50 urn. Grass pollen is wind-pollinated and
cannot be distinguished easily to the genus or species level, with the exception of
pollen from large cultivated grains of corn (Zea mays) which are greater than 70 urn
in size. The grass grains found in the Baker Cave coprolites, however, are all of the
uncultivated, wild variety. There are at least 16 native grass varieties found in the
Devils River area today (Smith and Butterwick 1975).
Gramineae (grass) pollen was found at very high frequencies in many of the
coprolites analyzed, although not at extremely high peaks which would most likely be
observed with recently ingested grass pollen. High percentages of Gramineae pollen
were also observed in coprolites from Hinds Cave (Williams-Dean 1978; Reinhard et
a1. 1991), Conejo Shelter (Bryant 1974c), and Parida Cave (Riskind 1970). Martin
and Sharrock (1964) have proposed that a frequency of this pollen type over 50%
represents intentional ingestion, although Bryant (1988, personal communication)
suggested that based on the known pollen rain in the lower Pecos region even less
could be considered economic. Only two of the Baker Cave samples fall into Martin
and Sharrock's (1964) category of the economic use of grass inflorescences or pollen,
although many of the samples may contain grass pollen which was ingested many days
before the coprolite sample was deposited (represented by curve areas Band C in
Figure 4).
Grass pollen could become ingested through the eating of the seeds and leaves in
a type of "salad" with a mixture of other plants, such as berries, in a brewed tea,
through the direct ingestion of the grass seeds themselves, or by eating rodents who
have ingested grass pollen. Neither of the samples which produced a frequency of
grass pollen greater than 50% contained any rodent remains, although rodent bones
would most likely pass through the system quickly, leaving grass pollen showing up in
many fecal samples after ingestion.
DASYLIRION

Sotol (Dasylirion) pollen is an insect-pollinated plant type in the family Liliaceae.
Sotol is a monocolpate grain with a slightly reticulate exine pattern. Dasylirion
texanum growns in the Baker Cave area today (Smith and Butterwick 1975). High
frequencies of Dasylirion pollen have been observed in coprolite samples from Hinds
Cave (Williams-Dean 1978; Reinhard et a1. 1991), Frightful Cave (Bryant 1975), and
Conejo Shelter (Bryant 1974c). Pollen of this type has also been observed at frequen­
cies as high as 40% in some surface samples from the Big Bend Nation Park region of
southwestern Texas (Bryant and Jones 1988, personal communication).
Sotol pollen was observed in 28 of the coprolite samples and at a high of 9% in
sample 20. Because sotol is prevalent in the Baker Cave area, sotol pollen may have
become easily ingested through its contamination on food and water supplies.
Sample 20 may also indicate sotol at its frequency peak decline (curve area C) or sotol

MICROREMAINS / 45

which is being "hidden" by other high frequency pollen types, such as Brassicaceae
which is also observed in sample 20.
Sotol flowers were ethnographically observed to be eaten by western Texas Indian
groups (Newberry 1887), and the bases of the leaves and stems can be made into a
nutritious pulp (Sturtevant 1972). This plant also was observed to be used in distilled
liquor (sotol) in the northern Mexico, southern Arizona region (Vogel 1973). Sotol
leaf bases, quids, and shredded fiber were found in the upper layers of the deposits
at Baker Cave (Brown 1986) and at Hinds Cave (Dering 1979).
CHENO·AM

The Cheno-am pollen type includes pollen from the Chenopodiaceae family and
the genusAmaranthus (Martin 1963), whose grains are nearly indistinguishable from
each other under the light microscope. Cheno-ams are periporate grains, with
usually more than 25 pores per grain. The average size ranges from approximately 20
urn to 35 urn. Smith and Butterwick (1975) have observed Atriplex in the Baker Cave
area, and Williams-Dean (1978) listed Chenopodium ambrosioides, C. berlandieri,
Eurotia lanata var. subspinosa, Amaranthus berlandieri, A. powellii, and A. blitoides in
the Hinds Cave area of Val Verde County, Texas.
Cheno-am pollen was observed at a frequency of 28% in sample 18. This sample
also contained approximately 5% to 19% Chenopodium seeds. This suggests that
Chenopodium was used by the Baker Cave occupants as a food source. The pollen
may have been attached to the seeds, becoming ingested when the seeds were eaten.
Chenopodium seeds are very small and in order to ingest the seeds inflorescences
would probably have to be ingested as well. High frequencies of Cheno-am pollen
have also been observed at Conejo Shelter (Bryant 1974c) and Frightful Cave (Bryant
1975). Cheno-am flowers could be eaten like a spinach (Sturtevant 1972) or used as
herbs or raw greenery in a "salad." Chenopodium is also widely distributed and
known as a vermifuge of intestinal parasites (Vogel 1973; Reinhard 1985a; Reinhard
et a1. 1985).
HIGH·SPINE ASTERACEAE

High-spine asters are included in the Asteraceae, or sunflower, family and are
insect-pollinated. Pollen grains in this family are generally distinguished by spine
length, except for Artemisia which has a distinctively thick outer wall. Liguliflorae
pollen, from this family, can also be separated and is a fenestrate grain of 9-11 lacunae
(Kapp 1969). High-spine grains are tricolporate with spines over 2 micro~s in length
(Bryant 1969; Kapp 1969), although Martin (1963) defines high-spine asters as having
spines with a length greater than 3 urn. I have divided grains from the Asteraceae
family according to the 2 urn length division. Plants from this family are numerous in
the Baker Cave area with at least 17 species observed today (Smith and Butterwick
1975).
High-spine pollen was observed at frequencies greater than 5% in ten samples.
This pollen type could have become incorporated into the eoprolite samples through

46 / PREHISTORlCDIETATBAKER CAVE

the ingestion of pollen or seeds, and if economic, it most likely represents ingestion
many days before sample deposition, or pollen curve area C (Fig. 4). High-spine
pollen was frequently observed in coprolites from Frightful Cave (Bryant 1975),
Conejo Shelter (Bryant 1974c). Parida Cave (Riskind 1970), and Hinds Cave (Wil­
liams-Dean 1978; Reinhard et a1. 1991). Ethnographically sunflower seeds were
reported eaten specifically by the Ramah Navaho (Vestal 1952), the Navajo (Elmore
1943), as well as by most Native North Americans in general (Niethammer 1974).
The flowers themselves could have been ingested as a medicinal tea for lung ailments
as noted by Fielder (1975) and Burlage (1968).
TYPHA

Cattail (Typha) pollen was observed in 20 samples with a frequency high of 7% in
sample 11. If cattail pollen was ingested the low frequency from this coprolite would
indicate that the sample was deposited many days after ingestion. Cattail is in the
Typhaceae family and pollen from this sample can be identified to the species level.
The pollen is not in a tetrad formation of Typha latifolia but is the single monoporate
grain of T. angustifolia. Usage of this plant type by the Baker Cave inhabitants would
indicate that they were using the riverine resources in the area along the Devils River,
as well as the arid succulents. There is a natural pond on the ranch in which Baker
Cave is located, although researchers have not been out to the area to confirm or deny
the evidence of cattail. However, cattail was most likely located along the Devils
River. Ethnographically cattail was used and eaten by the Maricop, Mohave, and
Yuma (Cas tetter and Bell 1951). High cattail pollen counts could come from eating
the pure pollen of the cattail heads themselves (Williams-Dean and Bryant 1975),
from eating the young shoots (Sturtevant 1972), or from drinking water contaminated
with grains.
EPHEDRA

Another possible economic pollen type includes mormon tea (Ephedra) pollen
which was observed at a high frequency of 15% in sample 5. Ephedra, from the
Ephedraceae family, is a wind-pollinated plant whose pollen grains are polyplicate.
Grains of this type are mainly divided into two categories; Ephedra nevadensis type,
branched furrows, and Ephedra torreyana type, straight furrows (Kapp 1969). All of
the grains identified as Ephedra in the coprolites are of the E. torreyana type.
Ephedra seeds were suspected of being used in the Amistad Basin as a flour (Story
and Bryant 1966). and tea from the plant was used as a possible diarrhetic at Caldwell
Cave (Holloway 1983).
LAMIACEAE

Lamiaceae, mint family, pollen was observed in seven of the Baker Cave samples
with a high at 7%. Lamiaceae pollen is a stephanocolpate grain. The grains observed
in these samples all contained six colpi, although Lamiaceae grains can also be
tricolpate. At least five native species of Lamiaceae plants have been observed in the
nearby Devils River area (Smith and Butterwick 1975). However, this pollen type has
not been observed in significant amounts in other coprolites analyzed from the area.

MICROREMAINS I 47

Ethnographic accounts indicate that the flowering tops of Lamiaceae plants were
used to make a beverage by Texas Indians (Yanovsky 1936; von Reis Altschul 1973)
and the flowers and buds were used as seasoning (Densmore 1928). Medicinal
purposes included teas to purify blood, to treat colds, and to relieve nausea (Vogel
1973).
Background Pollen

The taxa discussed in this section, low-spine Asteraceae, Pinus, and Quercus, are
pollen types which probably reflect accidental ingestion of pollen during respiration
or of pollen that has settled on food and water supplies. All of the pollen discussed
in this section are wind-pollinated types and produce abundant pollen. These types
were probably not intentionally or unintentionally eaten; instead they reflect pollen
present in the environment. Pollen of this type is sometimes an aid in determining
seasonality of site occupation (discussed in Chapter 6).
LOW-SPINE ASTERACEAE

Low-spine asters, such as Ambrosia (ragweed), are tricolporate grains with spines
less than 2 urn in length (Bryant 1969; Kapp 1969), although Martin (1963) defines
low-spines as containing spines less than 3 urn in length. I used the definition of
low-spines as defined by Bryant (1969) and Kapp (1969) for this study. As stated
above there are at least 17 species of Asteraceae plants in the Devils River area today
(Smith and Butterwick 1975).
Low-spine pollen was observed in most of the samples with a high of 21 %. This
frequency seems high although low-spines are prolific pollen producers and such
quantities can easily occur naturally in the environment. In ethnographic accounts,
Anzona Indians were observed growing and eating low-spine composites (Castetter
1935), and the stems and leaves of low-spine asters were used by the Cheyenne in a
tea to cure cramps and bloody stools (Vogel 1973). Although there is ethnographic
evidence of low-spine plant use, and the observation frequency of this plant type the
Baker Cave samples seems high, this pollen type is probably not economic.
PINUS

Pine is one of the most prolific pollen producers and dispersers, producing in
some cases approximately 350 million pollen grains per pine tree (Faegri and Iversen
1964). Pine, which pollinates in the spring, can often be found in soil sa~ples even
though there is not a pine tree in sight (Mack and Bryant 1974). Pinus pollen, of the
family Pinaceae, was observed in most of the Baker Cave coprolite samples with a
high at 10%. A small stand of Mexican pinyon pine, P. cembroides var. remota, has
been observed 30 miles north of Del Rio in the Devils River area today (Chadderdon
1983). However, the fossil pollen record suggests that pine was more prevalent in Val
Verde County in the past (Bryant and Holloway 1985).

48 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER C4VE

Pine pollen are vesiculate and bisaccate (two bladdered). Uneo (1958) divided
pine pollen grains into two groups; haploxylon and diploxylon. Haploxylon are pine
grains which have "belly warts" or tiny verrucae on the underside of the grain.
Diploxylon grains, such as Pinus cembroides, do not have these "belly warts." All of
the pine pollen counted from the Baker Cave samples were of the diploxylon variety.
QUERCUS

Quercus, from the Fagaceae family, is a tricolpate grain (sometimes listed as a
tricolporate grain) with a verrucae surface. The average size range is approximately
30 urn to 45 urn. Oak, as well as pine, pollinates in the spring and is a prolific pollen
producer and disperser. Oak pollen was also observed in almost all of the Baker Cave
samples and reached a high of 18% in sample 19. Oak is probably not an economic
pollen type because of the high frequency at which oak pollen is observed in the
natural environment, and acorns (which would not introduce pollen into a sample)
and wood are what man mainly uses from oaks. There are three species of oaks
growing in a few canyons in the Devils River area today: Quercus fusiformis (scrub live
oak), Q. texana (Texas red oak). and Q. pungens (Vasey shin oak). The oaks observed
in the Devils River most likely originated from the Edwards Plateau (Smith and
Butterwick 1975), although oaks tend to speciate and intermix, forming many new oak
species and varieties (Merrill Sweet 1987, personal communication).

Parasites
Disease found in populations can tell much about the subsistence and general
quality of life for a group of people. In prehistoric populations disease can be
measured through the analysis of skeletal material and through the analysis of
parasites found in fecal and mummified remains. Parasitic remains from coprolites
were first discovered by Callen and Cameron (1960), due to a new rehydration
technique which allowed for the delicate eggs and larvae of parasites to be preserved
relatively intact.
ETIOLOGY

Differences have been noted between the prevalence of parasitic disease in
hunter-gatherers (H/G) and agriculturalists (Hall 1972; Reinhard 1985a). Agricul­
turalists and H/G have very different subsistence bases and lifeways which seem to
influence the types of diseases found in each group and the types of parasites that
infect them. Parasitological analyses of H/G coprolites have been conduct~d (Fry
and Moore 1969; Moore et a1. 1969; Hall 1972, 1977; Zimmerman 1975; Fry 1976a,
1985; Reinhard in press), however an increased number of parasitological studies of
H/G coprolites need to be conducted in order to identify if parasites commonly
inhabit H/G populations, and if they do which types are more prevalent.
Hunter-gatherers, such as the prehistoric Baker Cave occupants, are mobile
people who socialized in small groups with limited contact between different groups.
They lived in temporary dwellings, usually moving in a seasonal pattern, and tended

MICROREMAINS I 49

to enjoy a well-balanced diet (Dunn 1968). The physical environment was the most
important aspect in their lives (Nelson 1967) because their life and subsistence were
centered on the environment and what it provided (Hayden 1971). Nomads also tend
to carry as few items as possible, and the items that they do carry are lightweight, thus
they usually do not use or make pottery (Kirchhoff 1971).
Agriculturalists, on the other hand, tend to be sedentary in order to tend the
crops, and live in larger groups because of the increase in popUlation that an agricul­
tural subsistence base can support. Their dwellings are more permanent structures,
such as the pueblos seen in the southwestern United States or the Maya and Aztec
communities in Mexico and Central America. There is also extensive contact be­
tween groups of people, due to a population increase and widespread trading
networks. Even though an agricultural existence allows for an increase in population,
corn, a predominant agricultural food, is known to be a poor source of iron, deficient
in essential amino acids lysine and tryptophan, and the phytic acid present in corn
inhibits intestinal absorption of nutrients. This can lead to undernourishment and
anemia (EI-Najjar 1976; Walker 1985). With the adoption of agriculture there tends
to be a decrease in the quality of health, although health should be analyzed in a local
or regional setting rather than in general terms (Rose et a1. 1984; Palkovich 1984).
Parasites are dependent on environmental factors, hosts, and specific geographi­
cal ranges. In order for infestation to take place, host contact is needed. Some
parasites use intermediate hosts in the infection process, thus increasing their
specialization (Fenner 1970). Considering these requirements the size of a host
community is most important (Fenner 1970). A large community produces more
hosts to infect. This is especially important because if the parasite has a short
gestation period an immediate host is needed for rapid transfer and constant reinfec­
tion. An agricultural subsistence base provides such a large population needed by
most parasites.
Human activity also influences the degree of parasitic infection (Nelson 1967).
As people become more sedentary, the population increases and close contact is
maintained. Therefore, waste disposal can become a problem. Many parasites thrive
in fecal material, and produces a breeding ground for more disease, with the problem
increasing as feces and urine are used as fertilizer for a larger crop yield. Poor
sanitation methods also increase the chances of food contamination (Walker 1985).
Irrigation, sometimes used to increase crop production, can bring in and aid the
dispersal of water-borne parasites (Cockburn 1967; Dunn 1968; Alland 1969; Fenner
1970; McNeill 1979). Animals may also become domesticated, bringing in' their own
suite of parasites to add to existing problems (Cockburn 1967; Dunn 1968; Alland
1969; Fenner 1970; McNeill 1979). Finally, the storage of grains and the disturbance
of the local environment, which follows agricultural subsistence, leads to an increase
in rodents and wild animals, respectively, and their facultative parasites as well
(Reinhard 1985a).

50 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER CAVE

In comparison, hunter-gatherers would seem to have a relatively parasite free
environment, although this is probably not entirely the case due to the evolution of
parasites from ancestral non-human primates to man (Kliks 1983). As man's mobility
increased some parasites were lost, due to their specific habitat range and the changes
in environment and temperature, as new parasites were picked up. This was specifi­
cally demonstrated as man migrated across the cold arctic environment of the Bering
Strait into North America. Some parasites followed and some were left behind
(Cockburn 1967; McNeill 1979).
RESULTS

An endoparasitological analysis of 14 of the Baker Cave coprolites was conducted
by Karl J. Reinhard (1987). This analysis has been incorporated into a parasitological
study of 38 Hinds Cave coprolites in order to obtain a more comprehensive statement
about the paleoparasitology of the trans-Pecos area (Reinhard in press). In both
studies no parasites were observed,indicating that the hunter-gatherers of the trans­
Pecos area were probably free from endoparasites, although more studies need to be
conducted in order to increase the sample size. Reinhard et a1. (1985) states that
50-100 HIG coprolites should be analyzed before the absence of parasitism can be
confirmed.

Eight of the Baker Cave samples, 1,5,6, 7, 8, 17, and 23, contained coprophagous
mites, probably contributing to the partial decomposition of the coprolites after
deposition and before desiccation (Reinhard 1987). A nematode was also observed
in sample 21. This nematode was most likely free-living or coprophagous due to the
morphology, which did not correspond to the morphology of other parasitic
nematodes (Reinhard 1987). The presence of this nematode, which measured 150
urn in length, indicates that conditions were suitable for the recovery of cestode
parasites, if present (Reinhard 1987).
Section Summary
As stated earlier in this section, pollen is a unique resource in the analysis of
coprolites because it provides information which cannot be obtained from the sole
analysis of the coprolitic macro remains. Pollen, depending on size and structure,
becomes caught in the intestinal lumen, allowing for pollen to be excreted in fecal
samples for up to one month after ingestion. Therefore, the pollen content of
coprolites does not reflect one meal, but can reflect numerous meals with a variety of
pollen types. Economic pollen, thus, can be observed and analyzed in many samples,
rather than in only a few samples as with macroremains.
Pollen concentration determination has not been analyzed in many coprolite
studies, but is an important aspect of such research. Concentration values can help
determine which pollen types were most likely ingested a few days before the sample
was deposited and are therefore at their pollen output peak. Samples which contain
over 100,000 pollen grains per gram of material usually contain this type of pollen.

MICROREMAINS I 51

Samples which contain less than 100,000 pollen grains per gram of material may
contain pollen types which were ingested many days before the sample was deposited,
or pollen types which are background, or noneconomic.
Modern fecal pollen concentration studies are useful in determining the amount
of time it takes different pollen types to pass through the digestive system and at what
time the pollen type peaks, or is at its highest frequency. These studies are also useful
in determining the problems inherent in pollen studies of coprolites, and ways in
which to overcome such problems. Pollen tends to flood the count a few days after
ingestion when it reaches its peak. At this time the newly ingested pollen may
obscure other pollen types which are economic, but were ingested many days before
sample excretion. Pollen observed at low frequencies may include such obscured
economic pollen. However, pollen at low frequencies may also represent pollen
which has not been obscured but was ingested many days before deposition or pollen
which is merely background, uneconomic, pollen.
Modern fecal studies are thus invaluable as guides in trying to interpret prehis­
toric coprolite pollen content and the limitations of the data. More modern fecal
pollen studies, however, need to be conducted. These studies will need to determine
both pollen percentage and concentration. The diet of the participants will have to
be stringently followed in order to minimize the influence of outside pollen con­
taminants, particularly from bread and canned foods (Williams-Dean 1978). The
study will have to include many people, and thus as diverse a population of digestive
systems as possible over a long period of time. An ideal addition to such a study
would include the observance of the effect of a high fiber and a high meat diet on
pollen output and fecal output in general.
The most easily observed economic pollen types in the Baker Cave coprolite
spectra, pollen which was most likely ingested "a few days before sample deposition,
include Brassicaceae (mustard family), Artemisia (sagebrush), and Gramineae
(grass). Gramineae pollen, considered economic, has been observed at high frequen­
cies in many coprolite samples from the lower Pecos area (Riskind 1970; Bryant
1974c; Williams-Dean 1978; Reinhard et a1. 1991). These studies, with the addition
of the present Baker Cave analysis, reflect a large time range, from approximately
9,000 B.P. to A.D. 900. The eating of grass inflorescences or seeds remains a stable,
unchanged aspect of prehistoric lower Pecos diet. Brassicaceae and Artemisia pollen,
however, have not been observed in other studies from the lower Pecos area and most
likely reflect new resources which were added through time.
No parasites were observed in the analysis Baker Cave and Hinds Cave coprolites
(Reinhard in press), indicating that the lower Pecos population, as with many hunter­
gatherer populations, was most likely parasite free. This parasite free situation is
most likely related to human activity and behavioral characteristics which are in­
herent in H/G situations, as compared to agriculturalists. These include small group
size, nomadic or semi-nomadic travelling patterns, decreased occurrence of close
contact between groups, no grain storage practices, and decreased occurrences of

52 / PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER C4VE

environmental disturbance. Numerous mites and a nematode were observed in the
Baker Cave coprolites, although these animals were most likely coprophagous, espe­
cially in the case of the mites. This indicates that the coprolites remained moist for
a period of time after deposition.

CHAPTER IV
MACRO REMAINS
The macroremains of the coprolites include plant remains, animal remains, and
miscellaneous material. The plant remains include: 1) fibers; unknown, onion, prick­
ly pear, yucca, agave, and sotol, 2) plant associated items; phytoliths (druse type),
charcoal, spines, and an unknown ball-type thread, and 3) seeds/nuts; prickly pear,
juniper, mesquite, chenopod, pincushion cactus, possibly mustard-type seeds, hack­
berry, acorn, walnut, and unknown. The animal remains include 1) bone; fish, lizard,
snake, unknown rodent, white-footed mouse, wood rat, bird, and rabbit, and 2)
animal associated items; scales, hair, lizard skin, feathers, and shell. Miscellaneous
items include; insects, puparia encasings, sand/dirt, and pebbles/rocks. The percent­
age with which these items were observed in the 38 coprolites are listed in Table 12.
The plant macroremains observed in the Baker Cave coprolites are listed in Table 13,
and the animal macroremains are listed in Table 14.
Plant Remains
FIBER

Fiber and plant associated remains were found in all of the coprolites making
these the main constituents. For this analysis fiber included plant vascular tissue,
epidermal tissue, and bulbs. Fiber identifications were obtained through comparison
with known samples, such as prickly pear vascular tissue and epidermis, and onion.
Fiber was also identified by the examination of epidermal tissue under a compound
stereoscopic microscope at 400X, which will be discussed in the epidermis section.
The fiber types identified in the coprolite samples include onion, prickly pear, yucca,
agave, and sotol. Unknown fiber, however, was the most prevalent (89%). The
unknown fiber may include fiber of prickly pear, onion, yucca, agave, sotol, or other
plants ingested, although positive identifications could not be made. The unknown
fiber types mainly included a dark, bark-like fiber, a red/brown fiber, and skin-like
tissue, all of which could not be identified with known samples or through micro­
scopic examination.
The most prevalent identified fiber type observed in the coprolites was prickly
pear (Opuntia). This fiber type included large amounts of vascular tissue. and white,
"cornflake-like" epidermis. The vascular tissue of prickly pear is easily identified and
was observed at frequencies greater than 50% in six samples. Prickly pear fiber was
also identified by the large amounts of druse-type calcium oxylate crystals, which are
indicative of prickly pear (Jones n.d.), that were adhering to or incorporated into
fibrous particles.

Onion bulbs and fiber (Allium) were also prevalent in the coprolites, being
observed in 29% of the samples. Onion fiber was observed in one sample, sample 25,
above 80%. The fiber observed was mainly that of the reticulate outer surface, most
likely that of the wild onion (A. drummondii). Some of the bulb remains were nearly
complete, suggesting that the bulbs may have been swallowed whole. The samples
which contained onion bulbs and fiber also tended to be associated with a higher than
normal amount of dirt and sand, and no charring was evident on the remains. This
suggests that the onions may have been eaten raw as they were pulled from the
ground. Onion fiber was also a prevalent element in the upper levels of Baker Cave
(Brown n.d.).

MACROREMAINS / 59

Sotol (Dasylirion) fiber was observed in 24% of the coprolites, mainly through
microscopic identification. Sotol fiber was identified without the use of the micro­
scope, however, in a few of the samples. These remains contained the distinct spiny
edges of sotolleaves. Sotolleaves contain medium spines interspersed between tiny
spines. Sotol fiber, cut sotol leaf bases, and sotol quids were one of the main
components of the upper levels of the Baker Cave matrix (Brown n.d.).
EPIDERMIS

The identification of fiber types microscopically was initiated by Bell and King
(1944). In this method they soaked plant tissues of Agave, Yucca, Nolina, and
Dasylirion in a 10% sodium hydroxide solution. They observed differences in vas­
cular tissue, leaf cross sections, and lumen diameters (Bell and King 1944).
Identifications of fibrous tissue of sotol (Dasylirion), yucca (Yucca), and agave (Agave
lechuguilla) adhering to stone tools was also made in a study conducted by Shafer and
Holloway (1979) on the analysis of stone tool function.
In the present analysis a small comparative collection was first made. This
collection included the epidermis of sotol, prickly pear, yucca, agave, and grass from
known modern samples from the Baker Cave area and the epidermis from known
samples from archaeological deposits from Hinds Cave. I am presently undertaking
a study which will expand the epidermal fiber comparative collection to include a
large variety of plants from the lower Pecos area.
The samples were soaked in a 0.5% tri-sodium phosphate solution for 12 hours.
The epidermis was peeled off the sample, mounted on a microscope slide, and stained
with basic fuschin. The epidermal cell patterning and the guard cell/stomata pattern­
ing were observed for these samples under a compound stereomicroscope at 400X,
and compared to the epidermal samples extracted from the Baker Cave coprolites.
The epidermis identified from the Baker Cave samples included prickly pear, yucca,
agave, and sotol. Grass epidermis was not observed, although this does not mean
grass fiber was not a component of the coprolites. Grass fiber may be one of the
fibrous types included in the unknown fiber category.
Sotol (Dasylirion) was the most prevalent epidermal type observed in the
coprolites. The epidermal cell shape of sotol is elongate, rectangular. The cells are
oriented in overlapping, patterned rows. There are usually two guard cell types
surrounding the stomata of sotol. One type is a squarish pair of cells which jut into
the stomatal area. The other guard cell types includes two or three cell pairs. These
.
cells are more elongate and stay on the periphery of the stomata.
Prickly pear (Opuntia) was the second most prevalent epidermal type identified
from the coprolites. Prickly pear epidermal cells have no real order and are errati­
cally placed within the epidermis. The stomata and guard cells are distinct. They
contain two basic elongate guard cells which surround and enclose the stomata.
Smaller cells tend to surround these guard cells, possibly in association with the
stomata.

60 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER CAVE

Agave epidermis, most likely that of Agave lechuguilla, was microscopically iden­
tified in 13% of the coprolites. The epidermal cell patterning of agave is a lozenge,
or ovoid, shape in overlapping, patterned rows (Fig. 6). Figure 6 also shows rhaphid
phytoliths which are the type observed in agave.
Yucca (Yucca) epidermis was observed in 11 % of the coprolites. The distinct
epidermal cell patterning of yucca is an ovoid elongate patterning which is observed
in overlapping, patterned rows.
SEEDS/NUTS

Fruit, seeds, and nuts were observed in 39% of the samples. The prevalence of
seeds in the Baker Cave coprolites is much lower than that observed from coprolites
dating to earlier periods at Hinds Cave (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983). In the
study conducted by Williams-Dean (1978), 98% of the coprolites contained seeds,
and in the study conducted by Stock (1983). 85.45% of the samples contained seeds.
This suggests that seeds were not a major dietary item at the time the Baker Cave
coprolites were deposited, with the possible exception of prickly pear. This may also
indicate that the coprolites were deposited during a season in which fruits were not
available.
The most prevalent seed type observed was prickly pear (Opuntia). Opuntia
seeds are divided into two subgenera, Platyopuntia, and the cholla-type. All of the
Opuntia seeds observed in these samples are of the Platyopuntia variety, which are
from the prickly pear cactus. These fruit seeds were observed at a high frequency of
95-100% in sample 7 and at a frequency of 80-95% in sample 8. These seeds were
extremely broken and mangled with only 8 whole prickly pear seeds found from both
of the samples together. In sample 17, however, a majority of the prickly pear seeds
were whole or semi-whole.
The pincushion cactus (Mammillaria) was observed in 8% of the coprolites at low
frequencies (below 5%). This seed was identified using reference samples taken
from the lower Pecos area. This seed type, however, looks very similar to the seeds
observed in a picture from Stock's thesis (1983) in which she states as closely resem­
bling Coryphantha vivipara. These two seed types are not always able to be
taxonomically separated (Correll and Johnston 1970), although I believe that the
seeds observed in the Baker Cave samples are that of Mammillaria.
Brassicaceae (mustard family) seeds also were observed in 8% of the coprolites,
although only in trace amounts. None of these seeds were observed in samples which
contained high amounts of Brassicaceae pollen, even though Brassicaceae pollen may
become ingested when eating Brassicaceae seeds. This does not indicate, however,
that the pollen was not ingested with the seeds, because seeds and pollen can be
excreted at different times. Reinhard et a1. (1991) identified Brassicaceae seeds (cf.
Desurainia sp., tansy mustard) in five (20%) samples from Hinds Cave.

62 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER CAVE

Hackberry (Celtis) seeds were only observed in one of the samples at a low
frequency, less than 5%. This seed type was represented by the white, broken
fragments of the endocarp. As was also noted by Williams-Dean (1978) the outer,
reticulate covering was not present. This outer covering is present in modern fecal
samples, suggesting that the prehistoric occupants "have stronger digestive potentials
than the modern visitors" (Williams-Dean 1978: 184).
The small seeds of Chenopodium (goosefoot) seeds were observed in one of the
samples, at a frequency of 5-19%. Two of these goose foot seeds have retained their
testa. In her study on Hinds Cave coprolites Williams-Dean (1978) states that the
Chenopodium seeds observed in the coprolites were most likely ingested secondarily,
through the ingestion of a bird or rodent who has eaten the goosefoot seeds. The
Baker Cave sample (18) which contained the goosefoot seeds did not contain any bird
or rodent remains; however, this does not necessarily indicate that the seeds were not
ingested secondarily as animals remains and seed remains may have been excreted at
different times.
I do not believe that these Chenopodium seeds were secondarily ingested.
Chenopodium was observed at a relatively high frequency in sample 18, a higher
frequency than what would probably be observed with secondary ingestion.
Chenopodium also has an extremely high nutritive value (see discussion in Chapter
5).
Mesquite (Prosopis) seeds were also observed in one sample from Baker Cave, at
a frequency of 5-19%. These large seeds were all fairly intact. Both Williams-Dean
(1978) and Stock (1983) observed mesquite seed pods in the Hinds Cave samples,
although neither feels that the presence of mesquite reflects dietary practices. They
state that since mesquite pods are prevalent in the cave matrix the pods most likely
became incorporated into the coprolite samples upon deposition. I feel, however,
since the seeds of mesquite, rather than the outer leguminous pod, were observed in
the Baker Cave samples that the prehistoric inhabitants were most likely eating this
nutritious, sweet seed. Mesquite beans and pods were observed in the upper levels
of Baker Cave (Brown n.d.).
Juniper (Juniperus) seed hulls were observed in two (5%) of the coprolites. Both
of the coprolites also contained very high frequencies of fragmented prickly pear
seeds, above 80%. These seed hulls were a reddish, luminescent color and were all
highly broken and fragmented. Some of the Baker Cave coprolite samples contained
fragmented prickly pear seeds and some of them contained mainly whole or semi­
whole prickly pear seeds. It is interesting to note that the two samples which
contained the highest number of prickly pear fragments also contained fragments of
juniper seed hulls. This suggests that both juniper and prickly pear seeds may have
been ground together and ingested.
The thick, reticulate shells of the Texas walnut, Juglans microcarpa, were ob­
served in two of the samples at frequencies as high as 19%. Large pieces of the

nutshell were observed, suggesting that the nuts were smashed to get at the nutmeat
and the ground contents were consumed, shell and all. Gilmore states that the nut
observed in features at Fate Bell Rockshelter were most likely broken, boiled in water
to extract the oil, and the oil skimmed off the top for consumption (Pearce and
Jackson 1933). With this method the shells were discarded rather than consumed.
This is obviously not the technique used by the people who deposited the two Baker
Cave samples which contained walnut shells. Studies conducted on Hinds Cave
samples (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983) also indicate that walnut shells were
ingested with the nutmeat. The upper levels of Baker Cave also contained an abun­
dant amount of split walnut shells and walnut tree leaves (Brown n.d.).
One large piece of an acorn (Quercus) shell, at least 2.0 cm in length, was
observed in sample one. Acorn shells, cups, and oak leaves were observed in the
Baker Cave fill (Brown n.d.) indicating that acorns were most likely a dietary item. If
acorns were eaten they would have to be leached to remove the tannic acid. How­
ever, given the size of the shell specimen and the lack of other acorn shell pieces in
the coprolites, I believe that this acorn piece was most likely incorporated into the
coprolites during or after deposition.
Two samples contained unknown seeds. Seeds from one of these samples is most
likely represents those from the Gramineae (grass) family, although the specimens
were degraded and broken, making identifications difficult. The sample which con­
tained the possible grass seeds did not contain a high frequency of grass pollen, but
did contain bird bone remains. If the seeds are grass they may have been secondarily
ingested after the bird was eaten (Williams-Dean 1978).
CHARCOAL

Charcoal was observed in 84% of the coprolites, providing further evidence that
these samples are human in origin. Charcoal was mainly observed in trace quantities,
although a few of the samples contain over 5% charcoal. The majority of the samples
which contain over 5% charcoal also contain a high frequency of fish remains,
particularly sample (16), which contains 50-64% charcoal. This suggests that the fish
may have been baked on coals prior to ingestion. Most of the charcoal samples,
however, were tiny slivers and pieces that were most likely accidentally ingested when
they adhered to food that had been parched or baked. None of the charcoal
specimens were large enough to attempt identification. Stock (1983) also observed
high frequencies of charcoal in Hinds Cave coprolites, although Williams-Dean
(1978) does not state that charcoal was observed, except during microscppic pollen
examinations.
CALCIUM·OXYLATE CRYSTALS

Calcium-oxylate druse crystals, indicative of prickly pear (Jones n.d.), also were
observed in most of the coprolite samples (79%; Fig. 7). Calcium and silicates are
absorbed by plants in the ground water. These elements cannot be excreted by the
plants and are "stored" in selected cells (Piperno 1988). When the plant is ingested,
these calcium (calcium-oxylate crystals) or silicate phytoliths (meaning plant stones)

cells do not degrade but pass through the digestive system and are deposited into the
sample (Bryant 1974a). Many plant genera can be identified by their distinct calcium
oxylate crystals, which tend to be produced by desertic plants (Jones n.d.).
Although the 250 urn macroremain portion of coprolites were sorted for possible
phytoliths, only druse calcium oxylate crystals were observed. A dumbbell shaped
phytolith, representative of the Gramineae family, was observed amongst the Bras­
sicaceae pollen. An agave rhaphid phytolith was observed adhering to the agave
epidermaJ fiber. A future analysis of the phytolith contents of the Baker Cave
coprolites could be conducted at a later time using the 14 samples taken for the
parasitological analysis. These samples were extracted before heavy density separa­
tion was conducted, which removes calcium oxylate crystals and phytoliths.

A few of the constituents of the Baker Cave coprolites are plant items which were
not observed in a high frequency, or are not identifiable. The items include cactus
spines, and two unknown items labelled thread balls and a white substance.

Cactus spines were observed in 13% of the samples. Most of the samples were
too small for specific identifications to be made, although sample 6 contained a large
prickly pear spine. The spines observed were not of the glochid type as is observed
by Stock (1983). They are all straight and pointed, indicating that they had been
broken off from the spine base. The spines were not discolored to represent charring.
Two unknown plant remains were observed in the coprolites. These consisted of
small, twine-like items (thread balls) and a white substance which reminds me of
nutmeat. The thread balls were observed in 11 % of the coprolites, all in trace
amounts. They may be part of a cactus or some type of a fungus. Samples of the
thread balls were sent to Williams-Dean. She had not observed them in the Hinds
Cave coprolites and did not know what they could be (Williams-Dean, personal
communication 1988).
The white substance was only observed at low frequencies in one of the coprolite
samples. The substance occurred in medium- sized chunks, about the size of a prickly
pear seed, but was easily broken into tiny fragments. Although this substance looks
like nutmeat, it probably is not because nutmeat would most likely be broken down
during the digestive processes.
Animal Remains
BONE

Bone was observed in 53% of the samples. The most common animal identified
was the fish, followed in descending order by rodents, birds, and lizards. Unknown
mammal bones, snake, and Lagomorpha were each observed in one sample. The
bone observed in the Baker Cave coprolites is significantly less than that observed in

66 I PREHISTORIC DIETAT BAKER CAVE

Hinds Cave coprolites by Williams-Dean (1978; 97%) and Stock (1983; approximate­
ly 88%). Although bone was observed in lower frequencies than previous coprolite
studies, many of the samples contained bones from a variety of species. The remains
of two different rodents (Peromyscus and Neotoma) and a bird were extracted from
sample 9.
The bones that could be positively identified are listed in Table 15. Bones that
could not be identified accurately are not included in Table 15, but are included in
the weights listed in the appendix. Fish bone is also not listed in Table 15 because
only the ribs and vertebrae were represented, and these fragments were not identifi­
able to generic or specific levels. The parts of the rodents represented indicate that
generally the entire individual was eaten, either whole or semi-whole.
Bones of fish were the most prevalent bone types observed in the coprolites. Fish
remains were also quite prevalent in the upper Baker Cave deposits (Brown n.d.).
Fish bone was observed in 37% of the coprolite samples at a high of 20-34% in sample
20. Fish were identified with assorted vertebrae, ribs, and scales, although identifica­
tion to the infraorder, family, and genus level could only be determined by an analysis
of the scales (see discussion in the scales section). The ribs and vertebrae were not
distinct enough for identification beyond fish. Many of the samples which contained
fish remains also contained a high frequency of charcoal. Lizard bones and skin were
observed in 2 samples, and a snake vertebrae was observed in one sample, all in
association with fish remains.
Other prominent animal remains included rodents. The majority of the rodent
bones were of the mouse (Peromyscus sp.). Other rodents identified included the
wood rat (Neotoma sp.), and one molar of the cotton rat (Sigmodon). Many of the
bone fragments were only identified as belonging to Rodentia. Many of the bone
pieces were from juvenile animals, identified by the presence of epiphyseal bone or
the absence of epiphyseal bone ends on the bone components.
One lagomorph ulnar olecranon head was identified (cf. Sylvilagus sp.), and
unknown mammal bones were also observed. Bird bone was observed at low fre­
quencies (less than 5%) in 16% of the samples. Bird was also observed in samples
from Hinds Cave (Williams-Dean 1978), although the coprolites analyzed by Stock
(1983) did not contain bird remains.
HAIR

All of the samples that contained the remains of rodents, lagomorphs, and mam­
mals also contained hair. Some samples which did not contain bone remains,
however, did contain hair. Hair was observed in 45% of the samples with a high
frequency of 95-100% in sample 10. A majority of the hair was observed in clumps,
containing only hair, although some long. separate strands were observed. Meat is
entirely digested by humans, although hair cannot be digested. Thus, remains are an
excellent marker to the ingestion of meat.

Identifications by Roberto Vasquez of hair remains from Hinds Cave coprolites
(Williams-Dean 1978) yielded the identification of carnivore (possibly dog or
coyote), rabbit, rodent, muskrat, and human hair. Representative samples of hair
remains observed in the Baker Cave coprolites were mounted on microscope slides
and examined for possible identifications on a compound stereomicroscope at lOOX
to 400X. In the analysis of hair only the proximal and medial portions of the strand
should be analyzed. In the distal portion the cuticular pattern distances are too far
apart for identifications to be accurate.
All of the samples, except one, chosen for examination were identified as rodent.
Rodent hair is distinct because it has an interrupted medullary pattern in the hair
cavity, and a coronal pattern on the outside cuticle. Lagomorph hair is very similar
to rodent hair, although in cross section rodent hair is rounded whereas lagomorph
hair is a sickle-cell shape. The hair identified as rodent was then compared to hair
samples from a known species (such as Neotoma). No specific identifications could
be made beyond rodent hair.

MACROREMAINS I 69

The hair remains also included a sample either of a ruminant, such as deer, or a
human. In this sample the medullary pattern cannot be seen. The outside cuticle
pattern, however, is identifiable as a rough patterning. Rough patterned cuticles are
observed in both humans and ruminants.
A wide variety of hair types, observed in samples from Hinds Cave (Williams­
Dean 1978), were not observed in the Baker Cave samples most likely due to
sampling error. All of the hair observed in the coprolites could not be examined due
to time limitations. When a majority of hair was similar under the macros cope, only
a representative sample of a few hair pieces were analyzed.
FEATHERS

Feathers were observed in 13% of the coprolites, at a high frequency of 35-49%
in sample 6. Only one of the samples which contained feathers did not contain bird
bone remains. Feathers often contain distinct characteristics that allow for easy
identification of specific bird groups. The most distinct characteristic of feathers are
the barbed edges, which contain barbules (Bryant 1974a). The feathers extracted
from the Baker Cave coprolites were analyzed by Dr. Keith Arnold, Wildlife and
Fisheries Department, Texas A&M University.
Identifications proved difficult because much of the coloring was lost and the
distinctive barbed edges were degraded during the digestion process. The majority
of the feathers were tentatively identified as belonging to Passeriformes (song bird)
family, although positive identification would include examination of the secondary
and teriary structure under higher magnification. The feathers that were not tenta­
tively identified as Passeriformes could not be assigned to any taxon, however
tentative.
SCALES

Fish remains were an important constituent of the Baker Cave coprolites. The
bone remains from the fish were not identifiable. Therefore, the numerous scales
that were extracted from the coprolites were sent to David J. Lee, Wildlife and
Fisheries Department, Texas A&M University, for specific identifications. Lee first
compiled a list of the possible fishes in the area during prehistoric times (Table 2).
He then mounted a sample scale from each of the fishes on the list and photographed
them. These photographs were then compared to the Baker Cave specimens.
Lee had hoped to identify a majority of the specimens to the generic pr specific
levels; however, the prehistoric scales proved troublesome. The most distinct part of
fish scales is the marginal edge. The marginal edge was degraded in most of the
specimens, probably due to the effects of digestion and age. The specimens were also
difficult to identify because scales are different depending on where they are ob­
served on the fish. For instance, scales from the belly and behind the head are smaller
than scales from the rest of the body.

70 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER CAVE

The identifications of the fish scales from the Baker Cave coprolites are listed in
Table 16. All of the identifiable scales were cycloid or ctenoid (Casteel 1985). Most
of the scales came from small sized fish, although a few came from medium sized fish.
Most of the scales identified were from the Perciformes family, including the bass,
the sunfish, the crappie, the darter, the drum, and the perch, or the Cypriniformes
family, including the minnow, the chub, the shiner, and the sucker. A few of the
scales were from the order Antheriniformes which includes the pupfish, the minnow,
and the gambusia, and the Cleupeiformes, which includes the gizzard shad and the
threadfin shad.
Sample 25 contained scales of the Centrarchidae (sunfish) family. Eight species
of sunfish live in the lower Pecos region and may have been eaten by the prehistoric
occupants. Sample 35 contained scales from three different orders, Perciformes,

Cypriniformes, and Cleupeiformes. Scales identified as Cleupeiformes were also
identified down to the family levels as Clupeidae (herring family) and Salmonidae
(salmon family), most likely scales of trout. The scales from the Clupeidae family
were identified as either the gizzard shad or the threadfin shad.
Miscellaneous
INSECTS

Insects were observed in small amounts in 47% of the coprolite samples. All
parts of insects were represented. These included abdominal segments, elytra frag­
ments, thorax segments, femur and tarsus fragments, and head capsules. All of these
invertebrates were identified as coprophagous, insects that invade feces when they
are still wet. The analysis of the parasite remains also indicated that the feces had
remained wet for a period of time, allowing for coprophagous mites to enter. These
insects, therefore, were most likely not ingested.
The insect remains were identified by Richard R. Blume, College Station, Texas,
and are listed in Table 17. Most of the insects identified were from the Coleoptera
order (beetles), particularly from the Ptinidae family (spider beetles). The
Carabidae family (ground beetles) was also represented in the Coleoptera order.
The order Coleoptera, especially the family Ptinidae, are known for their preference
for burrowing and nesting in animal and plant debris (Spilman 1968).
Puparia fragments of Ravinia sp. from the Sarcophagidae (fresh fly family), order
Diptera (flies), were also observed in two of the samples with a high frequency of
5-19% in sample 22. These puparia most likely do not constitute direct consumption.
The puparia were almost intact, which would not be the case after passing through the
human digestive tract. Diptera also lay eggs in feces, which is probably the case for
these two samples.
SHELL

A gastropod shell was observed in one sample. It was a whole, intact, tiny
specimen which probably does not represent intentional ingestion. The animal may
have been attached to something and was carried up to the cave where it died and
became incorporated into the coprolite. The cave area would be too dry a place for
gastropods to thrive. A small piece of a larger clam shell was also observed in one
sample. This piece is the edge of the shell and may represent intentional ingestion of
the clams, although how the shell edge became incorporated is not known.
DIRT/SAND/ROCKS

Sand and dirt was a major constituent of the coprolites, found in 92% of the
samples. The range of sand/dirt varied from trace to 50-64% in three of the samples.
Rocks and pebbles were also observed in 53% of the coprolites, mainly in trace
amounts. Many of the rocks were small, white limestone pieces which may have
become incorporated into the coprolite after deposition or during the processing of

food items. Many of the grinding slabs observed in the lower Pecos area are in situ
limestone holes, which would incorporate a lot of limestone grit into the diet (Shafer
1986). Before analysis the coprolite samples were cleaned of adhering material, so
the possibility of outside contamination is limited. The prehistoric inhabitants would
also line the floors of the cave with vegetal material, such as prickly pear or sotol to
cut down on the amount of dust being generated.
The incorporation of dirt into the coprolites through the same modes of wind
contamination as wind-pollinated pollen types is almost assured. Dirt or sand could
have become incorporated into digestive systems during respiration or eating. Other
modes of incorporation could include through the preparation of food items, if the
food was prepared with grinding stones (Fry n.d.) or rolled on the ground to remove
spines (Whiting 1939). Dirt and sand could also have been incorporated into samples
after the ingestion of bird craws or fish stomachs (Heizer 1967), both of which were
observed in the coprolites. Dirt may have also been intentionally ingested as a
sweetener for foods, such as mesquite (Newcomb 1961). Stock (1983) observed
"inorganic grit" in a majority of the coprolites from Hinds Cave, although, again,
Williams-Dean (1978) did not observe, or did not quantify, that type of material.
Section Summary
The analysis of the Baker Cave coprolites shows that prickly pear (Opuntia) pads
and tunas (fruits), onion bulbs (Allium), fish, and rodents were the main food items
used by the prehistoric occupants, supplemented by many other nutritious foods, such
as mesquite, juniper, goosefoot, hedgehog cactus, walnut, hackberry, birds, rabbits,
and sotol, yucca, and agave. However, the main bulk of the diet of the prehistoric
occupants of Baker Cave was fiber from many different sources. Typically hunter­
gatherers (prehistorically and historically) have had a diet which revolved around the
consumption of fiber in bulk (Lee and Devore 1968; Burkitt and Spiller 1986). High
fiber diets have also been observed for other prehistoric occupants in the Baker Cave
area (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983). Sotol (Dasylirion), yucca (Yucca) and agave
(Agave) fiber were observed in the samples, attesting to previous statements that
these plants, along with Opuntia pads, were considered dietary staples, resources
which were available year round (Shafer 1981). Agave and sotol roasting pits have
been observed in the area (Harry Shafer, personal communication 1987) and at Baker
Cave (Ken Brown 1986). Fibers and phytoliths from these plants have been found on
stone tools (Shafer and Holloway 1979), indicating that the one function of these
tools was the processing of these plant types. These studies suggest that the suc­
culents mentioned were dug up with their roots intact, and roasted in pits in order to
cook the many clumped leaf bases for consumption.
Opuntia has also been found to be heavily used by the prehistoric southwestern
Texas inhabitants at Hinds Cave (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983; Reinhard et a1.
1991), and Conejo Shelter (Bryant 1974c). The seeds, pad fibers, spines, and
phytoliths have all been recovered, making this plant item a probable main staple for

74 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER C4VE

the area's population. According to ethnographic accounts, the prickly pear has been
used as a general food resource by North American Indians (Vogel 1970; Niethammer
1975; Millspaugh 1974), specifically the Navajo (Elmore 1943), the Zuni (Stevenson
1915), Indians in the Missouri River region (Gilmore 1977), the Ramah Navaho
(VestaI1952), and the Hopi (Whiting 1939). However, the Navajo, Yuman, Pima, and
Apache believe that too many prickly pear fruits may cause sickness (Niethammer
1964). The pads and joints have also been used in times of famine by the Hopi
(Whiting 1939) and the Tewa (Dick Ford, personal communication 1987). In order
to get the thorns off the pads they can be burned (Vestal 1952; Whiting 1978) or
rubbed off with bunches of grass (Stevenson 1915; Millspaugh 1974), and the fruits
can be rolled in the sand (Whiting 1939).
Many of the prickly pear fruit seeds observed in the Baker Cave coprolites were
broken and fragmented. Prickly pear seeds have an extremely hard testa, indicating
that the seeds were not broken during the chewing and digestion processes. The
occupants may have milled and ground the dried fruits of the prickly pear (Brown
1988), as has been observed with the Zuni (Stevenson 1915) or used what is called a
"second harvest" (Newcomb 1961) by removing the Opuntia seeds from dried feces,
grinding these seeds up and eating them. The "second harvest" method was probably
not used, however, because the prickly pear seeds themselves have little nutritional
value, especially after having already been through the digestion system once.
One coprolite sample, contained mainly whole prickly pear seeds. This suggests
that the prickly pear fruit was eaten without removing the seeds. Prickly pear fruits
have a dense clustering of seeds. Removing these seeds before ingestion would be
extremely difficult; thus when fresh fruit was eaten a majority of the seeds would
most likely be consumed.
Williams-Dean (1978) and Stock (1983) observed the prickly pear seeds from the
Hinds Cave coprolites to be dark in color, suggesting roasting of the seeds. The
prickly pear seeds from the Baker Cave coprolites were also dark in color, although
this color change could be due to staining during the digestion process, particularly
with bile. Bone from the Baker Cave samples were also stained a darker color than
that exhibited for modern reference bone. Roasting may have been practiced, par­
ticularly with ground up prickly pear seeds, but evidence from the coprolites is not
conclusive.
Medicinally the peeled stems of Opuntia sp. can be used as a type of salye when
placed over wounds, due to their mucilaginous properties (Train et al. 1957; Fielder
1975; Niethammer 1975; Gilmore 1977), although this type of usage would not show
up in the coprolites.
Onion (Allium) bulbs and fiber were also found at a high frequency in the Baker
Cave coprolites and observed at a high frequency in the coprolites examined fr-om
Conejo Shelter (Bryant 1974c) and Hinds Cave (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983).
Onion was associated with fish bone remains in four of the samples, indicating that

MACROREMAINS I 75

the onion was possibly eaten with the meat, as has been ethnographically observed
with the Ramah Navaho (Vestal 1952) and with the Missouri River region Indians
(Gilmore 1977). Onion may have also been used as a seasoning as has been observed
by Whiting (1939) and von Reis Altschul (1973) with North American Indians.
Some of the onion bulb remains from the coprolites were nearly complete and
were associated with a high frequency of dirt and sand. These samples were not
charred, indicating that they may have been eaten raw and whole as they were pulled
out of the ground. The native wild species of onion, Allium, has been eaten raw as a
type of relish (Elmore 1943; von Reis Altschul 1973; Niethammer 1974; Gilmore
1977). The Navajo and other Indian groups also store onions for winter use after the
plants had been dried (Elmore 1943; Niethammer 1974).
Juniper (Juniperus) seed hulls were observed at low frequencies in the samples,
all in association with high amounts of prickly pear seeds. Prickly pear and juniper
seeds may have been ground together and eaten. Juniper seeds were not observed in
any of the previous coprolite studies from the area, although Juniperus is a frequent
vegetational shrub in the Baker Cave area today. The Indians of the Missouri River
region used Juniperus virginiana berries and leaves boiled as a remedy for coughs
(Gilmore 1977), and the Cree Indians used juniper berries as a diuretic (Vogel 1973).
The Ramah Navaho used the berries as food when roasted or boiled, and as medicine
for menstrual or postpartum pain, stomach aches, and fevers (Vestal 1952). Juniper
berries were also stored by the Ramah Navaho for winter use (Vestal 1952). The
Hopi and the Navajo used the berries as food items (Whiting 1939; Elmore 1943.).
The Hopi ingested juniper seeds with piki, and the Navajo used juniper as a cure for
influenza (Burlage 1968).
Mammillaria, Chenopodium, and Celtis (hackberry) seeds were observed together
in one sample. Chenopodium and hackberry have been observed in coprolites from
Hinds Cave (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983; Reinhard et al. 1991), and
Chenopodium seeds were observed in samples from Conejo Shelter (Bryant 1974c).
Ethnographic information on the uses of Mammillaria seeds are not prevalent in the
literature.
Chenopodium has edible seeds and has been used medicinally by North American
Indians (von Reis Altschul 1973). Chenopodium ambrosioides was used as a ver­
mifuge by the Maya, Creek, Natchez, and other Indian groups.(Burlage 1968; Vogel
1973). The vermifuge properties have also been tentatively observed prehistorically
(Reinhard et a1. 1985).
.

Hackberry has edible, sweet fruits (Sturtevant 1972; Millspaugh 1974;
Niethammer 1974). Celtis berries were chewed, ground, and eaten by the Navajo
(Elmore 1943). The Indians of the Missouri River region ground the berries as a
.condiment and meat flavoring, and they were also "eaten only casually" (Gilmore
1977).

76 I PREHISTORIC DIETAT BAKER C4VE

Mesquite (Prosopis) seeds were observed in one of the samples. Mesquite
remains have also been observed in small amounts in coprolites from Hinds Cave
(Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983; Reinhard et a1. 1991). Mesquite was an important
food item to the Sonoran desert Indians, who relied heavily on the beans between
crops (Niethammer 1974). Mesquite has also been used by other Indian groups as a
food source (Burlage 1968), mainly after the seeds have been pounded into a meal
(Vogel 1973; Sturtevant 1972; Millspaugh 1974). The mesquite seeds extracted from
the Baker Cave coprolites, however, were observed in nearly complete form. This
indicates that the seeds were not pounded into a meal, but were eaten whole, at least
for that sample.
The high frequencies of fish bone observed in the coprolites attest to the impor­
tance of riverine resources to the prehistoric Baker Cave diet. Most of the scales
from the coprolites came from fish belonging to the Perciformes and the Cyprinifor­
mes family. Gizzard shad or threadfin shad scales were identified as well as sunfish
scales and Salmonidae (salmon family) scales. Fish also was observed in coprolites
from Hinds Cave, although in much lower frequencies than from Baker Cave. The
coprolites analyzed by Stock (1983) contained 12.72% fish; the coprolites analyzed
by Williams-Dean (1978) contained 2% small fish remains; the samples analyzed by
Reinhard et a1. (1991) contained fish remains in only two samples (8%). The
coprolites analyzed by Bryant (1974c) from Conejo Shelter contained 9% fish
remains.
Experiments have shown that less than 10% of fish bone survive digestion after
being eaten (Jones 1986), indicating that fish was most likely even more important to
the diet than the coprolites indicate. In almost all of the samples that contained fish
bones and scales there was a high frequency of charcoal in association. This suggests
that the fish were possibly being baked on the coals before being ingested.
Rodents (Peromyscus Neotoma, and Sigomodon) were observed in the Baker
Cave samples and were also observed at Hinds Cave in much higher frequencies
(Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983; Reinhard et a1.1991). Almost all parts of the
rodents were represented in the samples, suggesting that these animals were ingested
whole or semi-whole (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983). There was more variety of
rodents identified from the Hinds Cave samples such as Sigmodon hispidus (hispid
cotton rat), Onchomys leucogaster (grasshopper mouse), and Citellus (ground squir­
rel; Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983). The taxa of rodents identified by Reinhard et
a1. (1991) is not listed.
J

The variety of mammals identified from the Hinds Cave coprolites was also
greater than that observed in the Baker Cave samples. However, only 23% of the
coprolites analyzed from Conejo Shelter produced mammal remains (Bryant 1974c).
The only mammal remains identified from the Baker Cave coprolites, besides rodent,
were an unknown mammal bone fragment, a possible ruminant hair, and a lagomorph
bone fragment (cf. Sylvi/agus). The variety of bone identified from Hinds Cave,
however, included Ondatra zibethicus (muskrat), Procyon lotor (raccoon), Urocyon

MACROREMAlNS I 77

cinereoargenteus (fox), and Odocoileus virgineanus (white-tailed deer) (Williams­
Dean 1978; Stock 1983).

Snake and lizard remains were observed in samples from both Hinds Cave and
Baker Cave. However, frog (Rana) remains were only observed by Williams-Dean
(1978) in samples from Hinds Cave.
The differences between the amount and variety of mammals observed in the
coprolite samples from the two different caves may reflect many things. The main
component was most likely sampling bias. The number of Baker Cave coprolites
analyzed was less (38 specimens from less than 38 coprolites) than that for the Hinds
Cave studies (155 total coprolites). If more coprolites from Baker Cave had been
analyzed then an increase in variety and amount may have been observed. The
occupants from the two different caves may have had a different population of
mammalian and rodentia types from which to choose, either culturally or environ­
mentally, with the Hinds Cave area providing a more diverse sample. The difference
may also merely reflect a change in foraging practices during different time periods;
the Baker Cave samples reflecting the Late Prehistoric and the Hinds Cave samples
reflecting various stages of the Archaic.
It is very difficult to estimate the amount of meat that is consumed by coprolite
analyses alone. Meat protein is almost completely digested after thereby making the
identification of meat ingestion difficult. The nutrients gained through the ingestion
of bone grease and marrow are also not distinguishable from coprolites, at least with
present technology. Large animal remains will also not be observed in coprolites as
larger bone fragments will not be ingested. Meat from larger animals is most likely
removed prior to ingestion, unlike what has been observed with the small animal
remams.
Although only 53% of the Baker Cave coprolites contained faunal remains, this
type of material was probably much more important to the Baker Cave occupants
than the coprolites indicate. Seventy-one percent of the coprolites contained some
type of animal remains, such as hair, scales, and feathers, suggesting that animal
protein was more important to the diet than the bones indicate. This also suggests
that bone remains should not be the sole source of evidence for the intake of meat.
Seven of the coprolites which contained faunal material also contained bone ele­
ments from more than one individuaL This also indicates the importance of meat to
the diet.
Therefore, in order to have an increased understanding of the importance of meat
to the Baker Cave occupants, coprolite analyses should not be the sole source of
information. Zooarchaeological analyses must also be consulted before a true pic­
ture of diet can be ascertained.

CHAPTER V
NUTRITIONAL ANALYSIS
Nutritional analyses provide insights into a population's health, supplying
answers to previously unanswered questions, pinpointing nutritional deficiencies,
and possibly exposing cause and effect relationships of specific dietary deficiences
and health problems. For example, why females of a certain group mainly bear
children during the spring and summer months, and what causes certain children to
go blind before the age of eleven are questions that may be answered with a nutrition­
al study. Such cause and effect relationships include the lack of Vitamin C in the diet
causing the development of scurvy (Ortner and Putschar 1985) and a calcium defi­
cient diet causing an increase in osteoporosis (Robson 1972). The quality of diet
obtained after alkali treatment of corn (which is deficient in niacin and a niacin
precursor tryptophan) is also realized with such work (Wing and Brown 1979).
However, nutritional studies have mainly been conducted on modern populations,
and references pertaining to such studies are directed toward modern American
diets.
Nutritional analyses in prehistoric archaeological settings have clearly been
ignored (Yesner 1980). One of the reasons for the lack of such studies is the problems
that researchers face in the initial phases and subsequent interpretation of such
analyses. Archaeological data of any kind has inherent limiting factors. Samples
recovered from an archaeological excavation represent the best preserved and most
resilient examples of an assemblage, and so do not reflect the frequencies with which
these items may have been used by the prehistoric population. This is especially true
for archaeological food remains, both faunal and floral (Carbone and Keel 1985).
Another major problem with analyzing prehistoric food remains is determing what
was actually used as a dietary resource, what was used in some other fashion, or what
was a contaminant.
Coprolites are an excellent source of information for nutritional analyses because
the contents consist predominantly of what was eaten. This avoids some of the above
mentioned difficulties. Coprolites, however, will underestimate the amount of
animal protein that was consumed by a group of people, because larger animal bone
remains generally will not be ingested. Trace elements and minerals found in the
water supply will also be underestimated. A nutritional analysis of coprolite samples
is thus only a partial statement of the nutrition of a prehistoric group because
coprolites only reflect one portion of their diet. Other aspects that need to be
analyzed for a complete nutritional statement inc1ude zooarchaeological material,
ethnobotanical data, and drinking water content.
I have chosen to concentrate upon analysis of the coprolites since this nutritional
study will be the first of its kind conducted on an actual coprolite sample. This study,
however, does not include analyses of zooarchaeological material and drinking water

content, and is therefore only preliminary. An expanded nutritional study is in
progress which will include all facets of the lower Pecos diet. Nutritional analyses of
dietary information has only been cursorily covered for other coprolite studies con­
ducted in the area. The most extensive nutritional analysis of the area (Winkler 1982)
included a review of ethnobotanical and coprolite research in the lower Pecos area as
well as some nutritional values of a few of the botanical dietary items recovered.
Due to the prehistoric Baker Cave occupants status as hunter- gatherers (Lee and
De Vore 1968) and their longevity in the area, with occupation occurring for over
10,000 years (Shafer and Bryant 1977), it is assumed that these people were healthy,
nutritionally prosperous, and physically strong. Osteological data analyzed by Marks
et a1. (1985) and reviewed by Reinhard et a1. (1991), however, indicate problems of
iron and nutrient deficiency, caries, enamel hypoplasia, and extreme dental wear,
suggesting times of stress and malnutrition in the seasonal rounds and overall lifestyle
of the lower Pecos population. This nutritional analysis will test these studies.
This nutritional analysis will be conducted in three steps. The first step will
discuss the actual nutritional requirements of a healthy individual using the Recom­
mended Dietary Allowances as determined by the National Research Council. The
second step will discuss the constituents of the macro remains from the coprolites and
their individual nutritional values. The third step will draw the previous information
together, discussing the nutritional status of the Baker Cave occupants as indicated
by the coprolites.
Human Dietary Requirements
In establishing exactly how much of the essential dietary constituents are needed
by humans the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) will be used for this
analysis.
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) are the levels of intake of
essential nutrients considered, in the judgment of the Committee on
Dietary Allowances of the Food and Nutrition Board on the basis of
available scientific knowledge, to be adequate to meet the known nutri­
tional needs of practically all healthy persons (Committee on Dietary
Allowances 1980).
Estimation of the recommended allowances follows essentially fou.r
steps:
(1) Estimating the average requirement of a population for a given
nutrient and the variability of requirement within that population,
(2) Increasing the average requirement by an amount sufficient to meet
the needs of nearly all members of the population,

NUTRITIONALANALYSIS I 81

(3) Increasing the allowance to account for inefficient utilization by the
body of the nutrients as consumed (poor absorption, poor conversion of
precursor to active forms, etc.),
(4) Using judgment in interpreting and extrapolating allowances when
information on requirements is limited (Committee on Dietary Al­
lowances 1980).
Dietary requirements include carbohydrates, protein, amino acids, fiber, fat,
vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and water. These substances are directly con­
verted into energy in order to maintain or rebuild body structures or are stored for
later use. These requirements that will be listed reflect the average of the actual
needs of a population (FAO/WHO 1973). Some individuals will need more and some
less of the specific nutrients, therefore only the group population is considered.
Recommended nutritional intakes have not been estimated for other populations,
however, some studies (Srinivasan 1981; Seckler 1982) maintain that the RDA should
not be used to compare and analyze "populations that have adapted to different
physical and socioeconomic environments" (Messer 1986:57). Populations may
adapt and survive on lower nutritional intakes than those deemed adequate for
western societies (Stini 1975), mainly by reducing calorie and energy expenditure
with a decreased level of work and physical activity (Messer 1986). Individuals may
also "adapt to lower levels of energy and protein intake at no function cost" (Messer
1986:58).
ENERGY

Energy is the essential outcome from the body's usage of the dietary constituents.
Carbohydrates, fat, and protein are the main sources of energy for the human body
(Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980; FAO/WHO 1973). Energy intake is de­
pendent on physical activity, body size, age, and climate (FAO/WHO 1973;
Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Additional energy (kcal) is also needed for
pregnant ( + 300 kcal) and lactating ( + 500 kcal) individuals. If energy intakes are
deficient, then part of the dietary protein is needed to provide that energy
(FAO/WHO 1973). The recommended energy intake, along with mean heights and
weights, for different individuals in a population is listed in Table 18.
Physical activity is the main factor determining differences in energy require­
ments, and is variable within a population, especially delineated along gender lines
and roles. The more active a person is the more energy that person expends and
needs replaced. Body size is also important in determining how much energy an
individual needs. A larger sized person requires "more total energy per unit of time
for activities" (FAO/WHO 1973) than a smaller sized person. The energy used in
moving a larger body mass is higher (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Age is also a significant determining factor in the amount of energy needed and
expended by an individual. As a person gets older the resting metabolic rate and
activity gradually declines. The resting metabolic rate has been estimated to decline

2% per decade (Durnin and Passmore 1967), but the decline in physical activity varies
for each individual (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Age also affects
energy requirements due to changes in body composition and weight and a possIble
increase in disease and disability (FAO/WHO 1973). More energy is also required
for growth and metabolism. During a child's younger years proper energy intake is
essential to fulfill the needs of an expanding and ever active body.
Climate may also influence the amount of energy expended. When performing
activities in a higher temperature the energy requirements are increased, along with
the overall body temperature and metabolic rate (Johnson 1963). Johnson (1963) has
also provided evidence that in temperate environments energy expenditure is greater
than in warm environments, with the cold inducing the production of heat through
shivering (FAO/WHO 1973). The differential human behaviors and adaptations to
climate are great, however, and climate has been determined to be an unquantifiable
energy correction by the FAO/WHO (1973) and The Committee on Dietary Allowan­
ces (1980).

NUTRITIONALANALYSIS /83

CARBOHYDRATES

"Of the constituents of the ordinary mixed food of man the carbohydrates are
usually the most abundant and the most economical sources of energy" (Sherman
1941:10). Carbohydrates are normally over one-half of the calories associated with
the human diet (Lloyd et a1. 1978), and mainly consist of sugars, starches, and
cellulose. Sugars include the monosaccharides, consisting of glucose, fructose, galac­
tose, and mannose, the disaccharides, consisting of sucrose, lactose, and maltose, and
the polysaccharides, consisting of starch, dextrins, glycogen, cellulose, and hemicel­
lulose (Sherman 1941; Lee 1975; Shahied 1977). Starch and glycogen are the most
important nutritionally for they are the storage carbohydrates for plants and animals,
respectively.
Humans can convert glycerol fats and amino acids to glucose, relieving the body
of its need for carbohydrates, although the best source of energy and glucose is
definitely through carbohydrates (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Lack of
carbohydrates in the diet leads to the breakdown of tissue protein, ketosis, dehydra­
tion, and loss of cations (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). To prevent such
problems it is recommended that an average human consume at least 50-100 grams
of digestible carbohydrates a day (Calloway 1971).
FIBER

Dietary fiber has been defined as "the sum of the indigestible carbohydrate and
carbohydrate-like components of food, including cellulose, lignin, hemicelluloses,
pentosans, gums, and pectins" (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980:32), or "the
plant polysaccharides and lignin which are resistant to hydrolysis by the digestive
enzymes of man" (1rowe111974:15). The majority of the fiber used in diets is derived
from the plant cell wall (Southgate 1986).
The study of dietary fiber is a recent phenomenon and data as to the specific
amount needed for a nutritionally balanced diet have not been published. Current
evidence, however, states that the average range of dietary fiber intake of populations
studied throughout the world is 20-40 g of fiber per day (Bingham 1986). Studies on
the different ways to measure dietary fiber content, effects of fiber on the gastrointes­
tinal system, and the different chemical and physiological properties of fiber have
been tested and reviewed by James and Theander (1981) and Spiller (1986).
The most prevalent view on fiber states that it is mainly indigestible and that there
is no specific metabolic necessity found for this product, except in providing bulk to
the diet and helping with the excretion of the body's waste products (Committee on
Dietary Allowances 1980; James and Theander 1981). Some studies, however, have
shown that the majority of dietary fiber (70-80%) is actually digested (Southgate and
Durnin 1970; Cummings 1986), and others have shown at least 25-35% is digested
(Lloyd et a1. 1978). Low fiber diets may increase the amount of disease (Trowell
1978; Armstrong and Doll 1975), such as diverticulosis and colon cancer (Freeman
1986), diabetes (Anderson 1986), and cardiovascular disease (Committee on Dietary

84 I PREHISTORIC DIETAT BAKER OlVE

Allowances 1980; James and Theander 1981). High fiber diets, however, may block
the absorption of essential minerals (Reinhold et a1. 1976).
PROTEIN AND AMINO ACIDS

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, with 20 essential amino acids,
linked by polypeptide bonds, forming the multitude of proteins needed to maintain
life. Proteins are the essential elements of both plant and animal cells. When
proteins are consumed by humans they are broken down through the digestion
process into the amino acids which are used by the body to rebuild body proteins and
for the upkeep and synthesis of other active body tissues and their functions.
One of the main constituents in amino acids is nitrogen. Nitrogen is lost from the
body through sweating, various excretions, and loss of hair, nails, skin, and other
tissues (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Another main use for amino acids
is replacing this lost nitrogen for growth and in order to regenerate new cells for the
above sources.
Proteins are essential to the diet but differ in their nutritive value because of their
different amino acid contents (FAO/WHO 1973; Committe on Dietary Allowances
1980). Only 10 amino acids are considered "nutritionally essential to life." Studies
on the importance of amino acids in the diet (Rose 1937,1938; Rose and Wixom 1955;
Bodwell 1977) have shown that if one of these amino acids is not included in the diet
the consumer is considered nutritionally deficient. These "indispensible" amino
acids and their requirements are listed in Table 19 and include histidine, isoleucine,
leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophane, and valine (Lee
1975; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Sherman (1941) also adds arginine
to this list of essentials.
FAT

Fats are found and formed in both plants and animals, and due to their increased
carbon and hydrogen content, with less oxygen, fats are a concentrated source of
energy (Sherman 1941; Shahied 1977). Fats used by the body are normally placed
under the heading of fatty acids, which can be used direct for sources of energy
(Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Excess energy is stored as fat in adipose
tissue, thus the conversion from fat to energy and energy to fat is an interchangeable
reaction. Triglycerides, made up of three molecules of fatty acids and one molecule
of glycerol, are the main source of fat found in foods (Sherman 1941).
A diet of 15-25 g of fat is sufficient to supply the fat and fatty acids required for a
nutritional diet (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). The primary essential
fatty acid required by humans is linoleic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid (Sherman
1941; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980), found in both plant and animal
resources. The amount of linoleic acid required in the adult human diet is 1-2% of
the dietary calories, whereas that for infants is 3% (Committee on Dietary Allowan­
ces 1980). Linolenic acid is also possibly a primary source of fatty acids in human
nutrition (Lamptey and Walker 1976), although this association is still inconclusive.

Arachidonic acid is also needed in the diet in small amounts (Committee on Dietary
Allowances 1980).
Fatty acid deficiencies produce problems in human metabolism, physiological
processes, cellular and membranal functions, cholesterol metabolism, and excretion­
al function, and induces flaking and drying of skin in infants (Committee on Dietary
Allowances 1980).
FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS

Vitamins are divided into fat and water soluble vitamins. The fat soluble vitamins
include Vitamin A, D, E, and K. Vitamin A is active in the human diet in the
preformed Vitamin A (retinol) state and in the carotenoid state of Provitamin A
(Sherman 1941; Lee 1975; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Vitamin A is a
necessary compound in the visionary chemical components (Sherman 1941; Lee
1975; Shahied 1977), deficiencies leading to inability to see in dim light (or night
blindness), damage to ocular tissues, the disease xerophthalmia in the lacrimal eye
region (Lee 1975; Lloyd et a1. 1978), and in extreme cases, blindness (Sherman 1941;
Lee 1975; Shahied 1977; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Vitamin A is also
important to the maintainance of the mucosal membranes of the eyes, respiratory
system, secretory glands, alimentary canal, and the urinary tract (Batchelder 1934;
Bloch 1931; Sherman 1941; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances
1980).

86 I PREHISTORIC DIETAT BAKER CAVE

The recommended allowances of Vitamin A are measured in retinol equivalents.
As taken from the Committee on Dietary Allowances (1980):
1 retinol equivalent =
1 ug retinol,
6 ug Bwcarotene,
12 ug other Provitamin A carotenoids,
3.33 IV vitamin activity from retinol, or
10 IV Vitamin A activity from Bwcarotene.
The average adult male requires 1000 retinol equivalents and the average adult
female requires 80 retinol equivalents. During pregnancy the requirement is 1000
retinol equivalents and during lactation 1200 retinol equivalents (Table 20; Committe
on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Vitamin D is important in human nutrition because it regulates and controls
calcium and phosphate absorption and metabolism (Sherman 1941; Lee 1975;
Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Vitamin
D also induces bone mineralization, preventing rickets (Sherman 1941; Barsky 1969;
Lee 1975). Two forms of Vitamin D are used by humans, ergocalciferol (Vitamin
D2), produced by the activation or radiation of ergosterol, and Vitamin D3, produced
by the activation or radiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol (Sherman 1941; Lloyd et a1.
1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). The sun's reaction with the skin
produces Vitamin D in the body, and thus the amount that a food item contains is not
necessarily reflective of how much Vitamin D an individual has ingested.
The requirements of Vitamin D decreases as a person becomes older and the
bones have ceased growth (but not bone replacement). Infants, children, and preg­
nant and lactating women should receive 10 ug of Vitamin D per day, although 2.5 ug
is enough to prevent rickets and maintain the necessary absorption of calcium and
phosphorus (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Young adults require 7.5 ug
a day and mature adults require 5 ug a day (Table 20; Committee on Dietary Allowan­
ces 1980).
Vitamin E is made up of tocopherol and tocotrienol compounds which are found
extensively in nature associated mainly with antiwoxidants, and is thus easily
destroyed by oxidation (Sherman 1941; Lee 1975; Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978).
Deficiencies in Vitamin E resu1t in a reduction of the life span of erythrocytes, and it
seems that as fat intake in the diet increases Vitamin E intake must also increase
(Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Children require 3.3 mg to 8 mg of
Vitamin E, depending on weight, adults, 7-13 mg, and pregnant and lactating women,
9-15 mg of Vitamin E a day (Thble 20; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Vitamin K, considered the antihemorrhagic vitamin (Lee 1975; Shahied 1977), is
found in two forms, Vitamin K1, found in plants and labelled phylloquinone, and
Vitamin K2, labelled menaquinones (Sherman 1941; Committee on Dietary Allowan­

ces 1980). Vitamin K "is necessary for the synthesis of prothrombin and other blood­
clotting factors in the liver. Defective blood coagulation is the only well-established
sign of Vitamin K deficiency in animals" (Committee on Dietary Allowances
1980:69). Vitamin K2 is synthesized by bacteria and is also found in animals. The
bacteria which inhabits the human intestinal tract provides most of the Vitamin K
required for a balanced diet, thus only an estimated range of intake are made for this
specific vitamin (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980; see Table 21).
WATER SOLUBLE VITAMINS

Vitamins which are soluble in water include Vitamin C, Thiamin, Riboflavin,
Niacin, Vitamin B-6 and B-12, Folacin, Biotin, and Pantothenic Acid. Vitamin C
exists in the form of ascorbic acid (the most common and the reduced form) and
dehydroascorbic acid (the oxidized form), both which are used by humans (Lloyd et
al. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Vitamin C is easily destroyed by
oxyidation (Sherman 1941; Lee 1975; Shahied 1977; Committee on Dietary Allowan­
ces 1980), and thus exposure to oxygen and high temperature cooking will destroy the
Vitamin C food content. If Vitamin C is lacking in the diet the consumer will develop
scurvy, "a potentially fatal disease characterized by weakening of collagenous struc­
tures, which results in widespread capillary hemorrhaging" (Committee on Dietary
Allowances 1980:72).
The recommended allowance of Vitamin C in the adult human in order to prevent
the disease scurvy and maintain an adequate ascorbate body reserve is 60 mg of
Vitamin C intake a day, although only 10 mg per day is required to cure or prevent
scurvy (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Infants are recommended to
receive 35 mg of Vitamin C per day and pregnant and lactating women should receive
100 mg per day (Table 20; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Thiamin (Vitamin B 1) is best known in promoting growth and preventing beriberi
(polyneuritis). Other functions include the increase in appetite, maintainence of
digestional tract motility, and serve as the catalyzing agent (as thiamin pyrophos­
phate) in the intermediary stages of carbohydrate metabolism (Sherman 1941; Lloyd
et al. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). The recommended allowance
for thiamin in adults and children is 0.5 mg/1000 kcal and older adults 1 mg/day
(Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980) because thiamin usage is less efficient in
older individuals (Oldham 1962). Thiamin requirements increase in pregnant and
lactating women, and therefore the requirements increase to 0.6 mg/lOOO kcal (Table
21; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Riboflavin is part of a group of organic substances labelled flavins, which also
includes lactoflavin, ovoflavin, and hepatoflavin (Sherman 1941). Riboflavin has
been said to be important in maintaining an organism's defense against disease and
deficiencies, including such symptoms as inflammation of the lips and tongue (Lee
1975) and light sensitivity of the eye (Lee 1975; Shahied 1977). Riboflavin has also
been proven to be essential to the overall generalities of good health and nutrition
(Sherman 1941; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Riboflavin is associated

with a complex called flavoprotein which aids in the transport of hydrogen (Lloyd et
al. 1978) The recommended allowances of riboflavin for adults and children are 0.6
mg/1000 kcal, elderly adults 1.2 mg/day, pregnant women 0.9 mg/1000 kcal, and
lactating women 1.1 mgl1000 kcal (Table 21; Committee on Dietary Allowances
1980).
Niacin includes both nicotinamide, important in the metabolic coenzymes
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotid (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADP), and nicotinic acid (Lee 1975; Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a!. 1978;
Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Niacin deficiencies result in the disease
pellagra, which include dermatitis and mucosal membrane inflammation, such as the
tongue (Sherman 1941; Lee 1975; Shahied 1977), and possibly dementia (Lee 1975;
Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Niacin
recommended allowances for children and adults is 6.6 niacin equivalents/lOOO kcal
and 11.6 niacin equivalents/l000 kcal respectively, with one niacin equivalent (NE)
equalling one mg of niacin (Table 21; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Vitamin B-6 includes the naturally occurring pyridines of pyridoxamine,
pyridoxal, and pyridoxine. These pyridines are coenzymes for amino acid metabolism
and a deficiency can cause epileptiform convulsion, abdominal problems, and vomit­
ing in children, and electroencephalographic abnormalities, convulsions and
depression in adults (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). The recommended
daily Vitamin B-6 intake for adult males is 2.2 mg, adult females 2.0 mg, 0.3 mg for
young infants, 0.6 mg for older infants age one-half to one year, 2.6 mglday for
pregnant women, and 2.5 mg/day for lactating women (Table 21; Committee on
Dietary Allowances 1980). Data for adolescents and children is not sufficient to
warrant a recommended Vitamin B-6 intake allowance.
Vitamin B-12, cobalamins, covers any compound with vitamin activity; com­
pounds may include cyanocohalamin, the most active, nitritocobalamin,
hydroxocobalamin, and thiocyanate cohalamin (Lloyd et a1. 1978). This vitamin
group has been linked to amino acid degradation, nucleic acid metabolism, nerve
function sustenance, fat metabolism, and polyglutamate synthesis (Lloyd et a1. 1978;
Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Vitamin B-12 deficiency can result in
pernicious anemia, an overall failure in the absorption of vitamins, which can result
in a depression of growth (Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978). The recommended daily
allowances of Vitamin B-12 is 3.0 ug for adults, 5.0 ug for infants, and 4 ug for
pregnant and lactating females (Table 21; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Folacin is effective due to the chemical structure and presence of pteroylglutamic
acid (PGA), or folic acid (Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Folacin is important for the transfer of single carbon atoms from compound to
compound, making it essential in nucleic acid synthesis and amino acid metabolism.
Deficiencies, therefore, include growth retardation and megaloblastic anemias
(Lloyd et a1. 1978). Since humans, along with other animals and microorganisms, are
incapable of synthesizing PGA, it is an essential element in the diet (Lloyd et a1. 1978;

NUTRlTlONALANALYSIS /91

Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). The recommended daily allowances of
folacin include 400 ug for adults and adolescents,S uglkg for infants, 8-10 ug/kg for
children, 800 ug during pregnancy, and 500 ug for lactating females (Table 21;
Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Biotin, a sulfur containing vitamin, is essential in fat and carbohydrate metabo­
lism, and functions as a coenzyme in reactions involving the addition of carbon
dioxide to other compounds and units (fixation) and in the transport of carboxyl units
(Lee 1975; Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Biotin deficiencies are rare, but include growth retardation, dermatitis, nervous
system disruption, and nausea (Shahied 1977; Lloyd et al. 1978). A recommended
dietary allowance cannot be stated because much of the biotin contributed in the diet
is from intestinal microfiora, although 100-300 ug/day has been established to meet
the needs of healthy adults, 500 ug/1000 kcal for older infants and children, and 15
ug/lOOO kcal for young infants (Table 21; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Pantothenic acid's primary role has been established as a component of coenzyme
A, which is required in the transfer of acetyl groups and acyl radicals from one
compound to another (Lee 1975; Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on
Dietary Allowances 1980). Deficiency of pantothenic acid results in many biochemi­
cal defects including growth retardation, tissue failure, infertility, abortion,
gastrointestinal problems, and overall skin abnormalities (Sherman 1941; Shahied
1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). A recommended
daily allowance of 4-7 mg for adults is suggested with higher levels for pregnant and
lactating females (Table 21; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
MINERALS

Minerals are inorganic compounds that are essential to metabolism, and are used
in structural compounds and components of the body (Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1.
1978), such as in the skeletal tissues of bones and teeth, and the organic soft body
tissues of blood cells and muscles, and as electrolytes (Sherman 1941). Essential
mineral elements include calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and
chlorine (Sherman 1941; Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary
Allowances 1980).
Most of the calcium found in the body (99%) is present in the skeletal system
(Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980), thus the main impor­
tance of calcium is maintaining the skeletal structure, bone metabolism and
formation. Another major role includes the control of nerves and muscles during
contraction and impulse transfer (Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowan­
ces 1980). A deficiency of calcium can lead to osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and rickets
(Shahied 1977; Lloyd et al. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Calcium
recommended allowances include 800 mg/day for adults, 1200 mg/day for pregnant
and lactating females, 60 mg/kg of body weight for infants, and 800 mg/day for
children (Table 20; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).

92 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER CAVE

Phosphorus performs similar functions as calcium. It contributes extensively to
the support structures of the body and with metabolic reactions, as it is a component
of the energy compounds ATP and ADP (Shahied 1977). The recommended allowan­
ces are the same as that for calcium (Table 20; Committee on Dietary Allowances
1980).
Magnesium is important in the function of many enzymatic systems, helping to
regulate the function of muscles and nerves. Deficiencies of this mineral include
reduced blood pressure (vasodilation), tetany, hyperirratability, gastrointestinal dis­
eases, and neuromuscular problems (Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary
Allowances 1980). Recommended allowances for males is 350 mglday, 300 mglday
for females, 450 mg/day for pregnant and lactating females, 50 mglday for young
infants, and 70 mglday for older infants (Table 20; Committee on Dietary Allowances
1980).
Sodium, potassium, and chlorine are all electrolytes found in body soft tissues and
fluids. Their main functions include controlling the osmotic balance and pressures of
the cells and in acid-base equilibrium (Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978). Estimations
of the recommended daily allowances of sodium include 115-750 mg for infants,
325-2700 mg for children, and 1100-3300 mg for adults (Table 2; Committee on
Dietary Allowances 1980). The recommended daily allowance for potassium (Table
21) is 350-1275 mg for infants, 550-4575 mg for children, and 1875-5625 mg for adults
(Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). The recommended daily allowance for
chloride includes 275-1200 mg for infants, 500-4200 mg for children, and 1700-5100
mg for adults (Table 21; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
TRACE ELEMENTS

Trace elements refer to elements which are found in body tissue in extremely
small amounts as compared to the overall constituents of the tissues (Underwood
1977). Synonyms of "trace elements" include "minor elements," "micronutrients/'
"microelements, and "oligoelements." Trace elements that have been observed to be
essential to the maintainence of health are manganese, iron, copper, iodine, zinc,
fluorine, selenium, and chromium, (Underwood 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee
on Dietary Allowances 1980), Molybdenum, cobalt, tin, vanadium, silicon, and nickel
are other probable trace elements (Underwood 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee
on Dietary Allowances 1980), although more research needs to be conducted on
these elements to determine recommended allowances, uses, and possible toxicities.
Besides being used and required in small amounts, most trace elements are also
toxic (Shahied 1977), producing such problems as loss of luster in teeth (fluorine),
possible increase in dental caries (selenium), and Wilson's disease (copper; Lloyd et
a1. 1978) when ingested in high quantities.
Iron is an essential trace element because it is needed for hemoglobin,
myoglobin, and certain protein complexes, such as ferritin and hemosiderin (Shahied
1977; Underwood 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).

NUTRlTIONALANALYSIS / 93

The actual absorption of iron into the body's system seems to be influenced by many
factors, including differences between heme and nonheme iron and the inhibitory
affects of calcium, phosphate" salts, and antacids (Underwood 1977; Committee on
Dietary Allowances 1980). The major cause of iron deficiency is anemia, which
reduces the number of red blood cells (Lloyd et a1. 1978). The recommended daily
allowance of absorbable iron for infants and children is 10-15 mg, 10-18 mg for adults,
and 30-60 mg for pregnant and lactating females (Table 20; Committee on Dietary
Allowances 1980).
Zinc is an important component of enzymes involved in major metabolic function
(Shahied 1977; Underwood 1977; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980), including
carbonic anhydrase and metalloenzymes (Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978). Zinc
deficiencies include retarded growth, loss of wound regeneration, and in extreme
cases hypogonadism (Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Infants are recommended to daily absorb 3-5 mg of Zinc, children 10 mg, adults 15
mg, pregnant females 20 mg, and lactating females 25 mg (Table 20; Committee on
Dietary Allowances 1980).
The major function of iodine in the human body is that of a constituent of thyroxin
and triiodothnyronine, thyroid hormones (Underwood 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Com­
mittee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Iodine deficiencies mainly include goiter
(thyroid gland enlargement; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances
1980) and possibly dwarfism and deaf-mutism (Lloyd et a1. 1978). Recommended
daily amounts of iodine include 40-50 mg for infants, 70-120 mg for children, 150 mg
for adults, 175 mg for pregnant females, and 200 mg for lactating females (Committee
on Dietary Allowances 1980).
The main usage of copper is as a constituent of proteins and enzymes which
promote the proper functional aspects of iron (Shahied 1977; Committee on Dietary
Allowances 1980), such as in the promotion of hemoglobin maturation and survival
(Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978). Other functions include myelin sheath nerve fiber
maintenance, reproduction, hair pigmentation and structure, and cardiac function.
Copper deficiency, therefore, mainly results in the degeneration or defectiveness of
the above copper functions, anemia, and hypocupremia (Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1.
1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Recommended daily allowances of
copper is 2-3 mg for adults, 0.5-1.0 mg for infants, and 1.0-5.0 for adolescents and
children (Table 21; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Manganese is found mainly in bone of the human body (Underwood 1977; Lloyd
et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980), and this trace element functions
mainly as a constituent of enzymatic systems associated with energy, lipid, and
protein metabolism (Shahied 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Al­
lowances 1980). Manganese deficiencies include deformed and retarded skeletal
growth, poor reproductive capabilities, and an impaired tolerance for glucose (Un­
derwood 1977; Lloyd et a1. 1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Recommended daily allowances for manganese include 0.5-1.0 mg for infants, 1.0-2.5

94 / PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER CAVE

for adolescents and children, and 2.5-5.0 mg for adults (Table 21; Committee on
Dietary Allowances 1980).
FIourine is found in the bones and teeth enamel, preventing dental caries with
appropriate intake (Shahied 1977), and possibly increasing growth rate, although this
has only been shown in laboratory rats (Underwood 1977; Lloyd et al. 1978; Commit­
tee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Daily dietary allowances offlourine include 0.1-1.0
mg for infants, 0.5-2.5 mg for adolescents and children, and 1.5-4.0 mg for adults
(Table 21; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Trivalent chromium is important for humans in maintaining carbohydrate and
glucose metabolism (Shahied 1977) and also as a cofactor with insulin (Lloyd et al.
1978; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Other affects of chromium may
include improved growth rate, lipid and protein metabolism, and longevity (Lloyd et
al. 1978)., Recommended daily allowances of chromium include 0.01- 0.06 mg for
infants, 0.02-0.2 mg for adolescents and children, and 0.05-0.2 mg for adults (Table
21; Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Selenium is involved in many functions, one of the most important possibly
includes as a component of glutathione peroxidase involved in cell constituent
protection (Hoekstra 1974), ubiquinone biosynthesis, and respiratory chain hydrogen
transport (Lloyd et al. 1978). Selenium is also similar to Vitamin E in that deficien­
cies of these two elements cause the same symptoms and diseases, but can not
necessarily be substituted for one another (Shahied 1977; Lloyd et al. 1978; Commit­
tee on Dietary Allowances 1980). Recommended daily allowances of selenium
include the same allowances as observed for chromium (Table 21; Committee on
Dietary Allowances 1980).
Nutritional Content of the Coprolite Food Items

The analysis of the nutritional aspect of a diet that is approximately 1,000 years
old has many obstacles. The main problem is that what was considered edible and
"good eating" at that time are not necessarily viewed in that context by today's
society. Many of the Baker Cave dietary items are not recorded in modern day
nutrition books and lists. Substitutions of the closest approximate item had to be
made for some of the dietary constituents in order to complete the nutritional menu.
Some substitutions included major changes, such as frog (Rana) in place of lizard,
and pigeon (the smallest bird found in the references) in place of the tiny birds
observed in the coprolites. Substitutions of a closer nature included using a different
species than those found in the coprolites or observed in the area. These included
Prosopis africana in place of prehistoric mesquite (Prosopis) , Descurainia (pep­
pergrass) and Sinapis alba (mustard) in place of the unknown Brassicaceae seeds and
pollen (although the seed looks very much like Descurainia), Allium cepa (onion) in
place of the prehistoric wild onion (Allium drummondii), and the rat (Rattus) in place

NUTRITIONAL ANALYSIS / 95

of the wood rat (Neotoma) and the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus). Freshwater
trout, catfish, and carp have been used to represent the freshwater fish types observed
in the coprolites. No analogues could be found for hedgehog cactus (Mammilaria)
seeds, and for the fiberous residues of sotol (Dasylirion) and agave (Agave), although
some nutritional values were found for the similar plants of sacahuista (Nolina) and
yucca (Yucca). Nutritional values for the economic pollen types of Brassicaceae,
Gramineae, andArtemisia were not observed, although some nutritional information
was found on the total plants in each taxa. The six grass species (listed in the tables)
used in this analysis are six species which are observed in the Devils River area today
and are native to the environment (Smith and Butterwick 1975).
All of the tables and their contents are mainly measured in amounts of 100 grams
per edible portion. This is the amount of food product that will be discussed in a later
section and will be assumed to be the quantitative amount unless otherwise stated.
The amino acid content of the food items are found in Table 22. Data not found or
studies not sufficiently conducted to warrant a result is marked with a dash (-). In the
majority of cases in order to analyze the amino acid contents of a food item a
conversion must be made. This conversion uses the nitrogen content (in grams) of
the food item in order to convert to mg/100g of food. Data already in mg/100g of food
is marked with (g) after the food item. The nitrogen content conversion factor of the
food item is included in the table, if provided in the data source. This conversion
factor was usually not provided.
The energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate content of foods is provided in Table
23 and the mineral content is provided in Table 24. Values for copper (Cu), zinc (Zn),
sulfur (S), and the essential mineral element chlorine (CI), along with the trace
element values, are rarely given. The values for the fat soluble vitamin food content
(Table 25) are also rare, especially that for Vitamin K in which no values were
observed. The water soluble vitamin food content is found in Table 26 in which most
of the vitamins are well represented.
The Nutritional Analysis
ENERGY

In estimating efficiency of the diet of Baker Cave inhabitants it must be first
realized that they were shorter in stature and lighter in weight than modern popula­
tions, which are used to esimate recommended energy intake in Table 18.
Consequently, it is probably safe to assume Baker Cave occupants would require a
lower energy intake. However, the activity of the Baker Cave inhabitants would be
much higher than that observed in a modern day population. In order to evaluate the
amount of energy a population receives, carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake must
be considered. The main energy sources of the prehistoric population under analysis
are those foods with the highest kcal value per 100 gram of edible portion and with
the highest fat, carbohydrate and protein content. The food items recovered from the
coprolites with the highest caloric values are prickly pear seeds (289 kcal), after they

Chenopodium seeds (195 kcal), mustard seeds (469 kcal), and pigeon (230-294 kcal),
(substituting for the bird species). The bird species found in the coprolites probably
contain less energy than the substitute pigeon due to their small size and probable
low fat content. All food with high protein and fat contents are similar and include
bird, mustard seeds, rabbit meat, fish, and Chenopodium seeds. Protein and energy
from meat would be underepresented in the coprolites because meat is entirely
digested after ingestion, and the bone remains from larger animals would not be
observed in the coprolite specimens. Carbohydrate content cannot be determined
due to the lack of data.

seeds (195 kcal), as observed in coprolite sample 18, realizing that a coprolite does
not necessarily reflect one meal, will provide at least 692 kcal and approximately
13.04 grams of fat. With the addition of mustard seeds (469 kcal), another fish, and
prickly pear seeds (289 kcal) the least amount of energy intake is 1539 kcaL This
energy amount is probably sufficient to feed most females and children, with the fat
content more than sufficient for the daily requirements for both males and females
(15-25 grams). With the addition of a few more staples, such as Opuntia fruits and
especially the nutritious seeds, fish, and possibly another dose of mustard seeds, the
daily energy intake would then be sufficient to sustain the males in the population.
Therefore, due to the higher caloric values, protein content, and fat content of prickly
pear seeds, birds, rabbits, mustard seeds, Chenopodium seeds, the consumption of
larger meat products not observed in the coprolites, and the additional supplement
of other less energy sufficient dietic items, the inhabitants of Baker Cave probably
received sufficient energy requirements.
FIBER

The main bulk of the diet of the prehistoric occupants of Baker Cave was that of
fiber from many different sources. The primary use of fiber is to provide bulk to the

diet, to increase fecal output (Cummings 1986), to facilitate food passage, and to
prevent disease. Hunter-gatherers (prehistorically and historically) have typically
had a diet which revolved around the consumption of fiber in bulk (Burkitt and
Spiller 1986). High fiber diets have also been observed for other prehistoric oc­
cupants in the Baker Cave area (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1982). Specific fiber
content of foods has not usually been analyzed, but due to the high fiber diet that the
Baker Cave occupants obviously had, their fiber intake was most likely nutritionally
sufficient to keep their fiber-controlled bodily functions running smoothly.
PROTEIN AND AMINO ACIDS

Due to the problems in amino acid content conversion, the overall amino acids
found in foods cannot be directly compared to the required amount. Infants require
much more protein and amino acids by weight than other age groups due to growth
of tissue and bone. This protein requirement is usually met with the intake of human
breast milk, although the actual amino acid requirements for lactating females are
unknown (Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980). An adult 70 kg male requires 56
grams of protein daily and an adult 55 kg female requires 44 grams of protein daily
(Committee on Dietary Allowances 1980).
Foods high in overall protein value are basically the same as those high in energy
content: Chenopodium seeds, mustard seeds, lizard, rodents, rabbits, and bird. In our
above meal, as associated with sample 18, the approximate protein content is 91.9
grams of protein. This content more than provides for the requirements of the adult
male and female. All of the essential amino acids are also represented in this "meal"
although the extent cannot be determined due to the previously mentioned conver­
sion problems. Chenopodium seeds, fish, and rabbit are the three food items
observed in the coprolite specimens with the highest amino acid contents. It must be
realized that the presence of larger game represented in the coprolites, would
produce a much higher amino acid and protein intake than that currently represented
in the sample meal. Meat is one of the best and most efficient sources of protein and
amino acids to the diet.
FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS

There is an overall lack of information on the contents of Vitamins A, D, E, and
K in food items, with a complete lack for that of Vitamin K. This deficiency must be
resolved before the complete nutritional status of the Baker Cave occupants can be
determined. There is more information on Vitamin A, showing that onion bulbs
provided an overabundance of this vitamin (5,000 IV) to its ingestors. The daily
requirement is at the most 3,330 IV. Since onion is a main constituent of the
coprolites Vitamin A deficiency was probably not a problem for the Baker Cave
occupants.
WATER SOLUBLE VITAMINS

Some water soluable vitamins are well represented in the food content analyses,
with the exception of Vitamins B-6 and B-12, folacin, biotin, and pantothenic acid.
The addition of information on these vitamins, as with the fat soluble vitamins, must

104 / PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER CAVE

be obtained before a complete statement on nutrition can be made. Even with the
lack of information on Vitamins B-6 and B-12, the contents of the items listed show
that one large rabbit with some onions and prickly pear fruit will provide the daily
requirement for Vitamin B-6 (2.0-2.2 mg), and one rabbit will provide the Vitamin
B-12 daily requirement (3.0 mg).
Sixty mg of Vitamin C daily is the recommended allowance for adults. This
requirement is met by eating two prickly pear fruits with the seeds, a few onions, or
a few Chenopodium seeds. Due to the high frequency of prickly pear seeds and
onions in the Baker Cave diet, Vitamin C was probably not a problem for the
inhabi tants.
Thiamin, Vitamin B-1, is required at an average of 1-1.5 mg/day for adults. This
requirement can be easily met with the ingestion of mustard seeds and carp fish, a
large rabbit and Chenopodium seeds, or one of the above constituents. Due to the
availability of these resources thiamin was probably present in the diet at the ap­
propriate requirements to maintain health.
Riboflavin is needed in the diet in slightly higher amounts than that for thiamin
(average of 1.2-1.7 mg recommended daily), and the same foods that contain high
amounts of thiamin also contain high amounts of riboflavin. Thus the same food
combinations that provide a nutritionally sufficient supply of thiamin also supply that
of riboflavin.
Niacin is required in amounts averaging 13-16 mg daily. Foods high in niacin
include mustard seeds, chenopod seeds, rabbit, rodents, and bird. All of these items
in a medium amount, such as one large rabbit, two birds, or 100 grams of mustard
seeds and 100 grams of chenopod seeds, will provide the ingestor with a sufficient
supply of niacin.
MINERALS

The essential mineral content of food is fairly well represented, especially infor­
mation on calcium. The highest calcium content in the food array is chenopod seeds
(1402 mg). One hundred grams ofthis food item will provide the daily recommended
calcium for all ages. Mustard seeds (521 mg) and onions (140 mg) are also high in
calcium. The requirements for phosphorus are the same as those for calcium (800­
1000 mg daily). Mustard seeds are also high in phosphorus (841 mg) along with
chenopod seeds (327 mg) and rabbit (224 mg). These food items could thus supply
the daily requirements of calcium and phosphorus for the Baker Cave population.
Magnesium is found in high amounts in mustard seeds (298 mg), showing that this
food resource could provide all of the daily requirement of this mineral (300-350 mg).
Data on the magnesium content of other food items is scarce.
Data on electrolytes, sodium, potassium, and chlorine are also scarce. Sodium,
required in amounts from 1100-3300 mg for adults, is only found in relatively low

NUTRlTIONALANALYSIS I 105

amounts in the food items studied. The highest level of sodium in these items is that
of pigeon (110 mg) and catfish (105 mg). A huge amount of these food items would
need to be consumed in order to fulfill the recommended daily allowance for sodium,
however, it is very probable that a food item or items not studied contains higher
amounts of sodium than that already observed. This is also the case for potassium
and chloride, although not enough information on chloride has been obtained to
make even a generalized statement.
Drinking water contains a high amount of these electrolytes obtained from the
soil. The content of the drinking water in the Baker Cave area has not been analyzed,
but until further research can be conducted it can be tentatively stated that the
occupants of Baker Cave most likely were not deficient in sodium, potassium. and
chlorine.
TRACE ELEMENTS

As with other nutritionally important elements, not enough information is avail­
able on the trace element contents of food items. The trace element requirements
for the inhabitants of Baker Cave, however, were probably met with the large
amounts of dirt and sand that were consumed, and in the drinking water content. Soil
contains the majority of the trace elements and in quantities that would probably not
reach toxicity levels for humans. As stated above dirt and sand were found in 91 % of
the coprolites, reaching a high of 50-64% in samples 23 and 24.
Section Summary

The nutritional status of the occupants of Baker Cave at approximately A.D. 900
has been shown to be generally good, although a much more rigorous study needs to
be conducted. Such a study should include analyses of the zoo archaeological
material. ethnobotanical remains, and the drinking water content. More information
on the nutritional contents of food items in the lower Pecos region is also essential.
Additional information is especially needed on trace mineral and electrolyte content,
fat soluble vitamin content, and Vitamin B-6, B-12, folacin, biotin, and pantothenic
acid content. With the addition of this information, a nutritional analysis would be
extensive and thorough and would enhance our knowledge about the lower Pecos
prehistoric population and other similar groups.
The seasonality of occupation of Baker Cave and for the deposition of the
coprolites is also important in determining nutrition. Seasons in the lower Pecos
have been divided into a warm and cool season (Williams-Dean 1978). Other
coprolite studies conducted on samples from the region have indicated a warm
summer season occupation (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983; Reinhard et al. 1991).
This analysis has determined the occupation of Baker Cave coprolites to have been
during the warm season (see seasonality section in Chapter VI). The actual diet or
nutritional intake for the lower Pecos populations during the cold season has not
been determined as yet. Therefore the nu tritional status of the Baker Cave occupants

106 / PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER C4VE

is unknown although skeletal information summarized by Reinhard et a1. (1991)
suggests that there was nutritional stress.

CHAPTER VI
CONCLUSIONS
Previous studies on the lower Pecos region of Texas and northern Mexico have
indicated that the prehistoric hunter/gatherers of that area maintained relatively
stable subsistence practices throughout their 9,000 year occupation (Williams-Dean
1978; Dering 1979; Shafer 1981, 1986; Stock 1983). Cultural stability, with only slight
changes, also persisted during the prehistory of the lower Pecos (Shafer and Bryant
1977; Shafer 1986). One of the principal causes of stability in both subsistence and
cultural practices for such a long period of time was the unchanging flora and fauna
of the area (Dering 1979; Lord 1984).
Cultural Ecology

The prehistoric inhabitants of the lower Pecos area are described as hunter­
gatherers, although their main activity was probably foraging. The organization of
the group centered around a sexual division of labor, with the women gathering plant
foods and the men hunting fauna; however it is probable that both sexes foraged
(Shafer 1986). Gathering and foraging of food resources provided the bulk of the diet
for the lower Pecos populations, although hunting was an important activity for the
men.
The gathering of plant foods occurred around the base camp, where the women
could watch the children. Small children may have been carried with the women
during gathering expeditions. Cradle boards, which would allow children to be
carried on the back, have been excavated from sites in the lower Pecos area (Martin
1933). An important woman's gathering tool was a good, sturdy, fire-hardened dig­
ging stick (Shafer 1986). These sticks were used to dig up the clumped leaf bases of
sotol and agave, as well as to pry up other plant materials. Hafted flake knives were
also a useful tool and were used for cutting the leaves off of succulents, such as yucca,
agave, and sotol among other things (Shafer and Holloway 1979). A carrying basket
was also important in gathering food resources in order to carry food back to the
home base for group sharing and consumption (Shafer 1986; Brown 1988).
When the men went hunting expeditions they probably traveled away from the
base camp to a more specialized task area. These specialized areas varied depending
on the availability of specific species at different times of the year. The hunters may
have stayed away from the base camp for a few days. Hunting implements included
the atlatl, or spearthrower, during the Archaic, and the bow and arrow during the
Late Prehistoric period.
Foraging consisted mainly of opportunistic collecting of available plants and
small animals. Small animals, such as rodents, lizards, and rabbits, could be caught

107

108/ PREHlSTORlCDIETATBAKER CAVE

with the use of nets, traps, and snares (Shafer 1986). Rabbit clubs have also been
excavated from lower Pecos sites and were probably used in killing game. Fish may
have also been caught using nets. Other methods used may have included poison
from buckeye seeds (Ugnadia), spears, hook and line, or with bare hands (Shafer
1986).
The home bases for these prehistoric people were most likely centered around
the lower canyon areas of the Rio Grande, Pecos, and Devils Rivers (Shafer 1986).
The lower canyon areas would have provided a wide range and variety of dietary items
which could be gathered or foraged. Water was prevalent in these areas, as well as
upland and marine resources.
It has been suggested that the rockshelters of the lower Pecos region, including
Baker Cave, were seasonal camps rather than permanent dwellings (Shafer 1986).
Rockshelters may have also been used for special tasks, such as roasting sotol and
lechuguilla bases in large bedrock ovens. These ovens have been observed in many
of the lower Pecos rockshelters, including Baker Cave (Hester 1983, 1986; Brown
n.d.). Rockshelters provide excellent shelter during inclement weather, as well as
shade during the hot, summer months, and warmth and protection during the cooler
seasons (Shafer 1986). Camps located outside of the rockshelters were situated
around waterholes and may have been the living arrangment for most of the year
(Shafer 1986).
.

Diet

The occupants of Baker Cave at approximately A.D. 900 used many resources
from their environment in their subsistence, in order to provide a balanced diet and
to medicinally correct any ills. The coprolites reflect a diet which included a large
variety of plant materials and small game animals. Other materials which would have
been important to the Baker Cave diet and not reflected in the coprolites include
meat from larger game animals. Fiber in large quantities was observed in all of the
coprolites analyzed. The prickly pear cactus was the most commonly utilized plant
and provided a stable subsistence base for the lower Pecos populations (Williams­
Dean 1978; Stock 1983). Parts of the prickly pear identified from the Baker Cave
coprolites included fiber, fruit seeds, calcium oxylate druse crystals, epidermis, and
spines. No Opuntia pollen was observed in the samples, indicating that at the time of
deposition prickly pear flowers were not eaten. Most of the prickly pear seeds were
fragmented, suggesting that the fruit was processed before consumption. In this case
the prickly pear fruits may have been milled or ground with metates.
Although a few spines were recovered from the coprolites, the processing techni­
que employed on the prickly pear tunas probably involved a method of removing the
spines. The spines could be burned off (Whiting 1939; Vestal 1952), rubbed off
(Stevenson 1915; Millspaugh 1974), or rolled off (Whiting 1939).

CONCLUSIONS / 109

Onion bulbs and fibers were also prevalent in the coprolite samples. Onions were
probably eaten whole from the ground because a high frequency of sand and dirt was
associated with the onion remains. Onion bulbs were also found in association with
fish remains, suggesting that the onion was used as a seasoning or relish (Whiting
1939; Vestal 1952).
The fiber from desert succulents were also observed in the coprolite samples.
These included yucca, agave, and sotol, indicating that these plants, which have been
considered staples (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983), were also important dietary
resources for the Baker Cave inhabitants. Pollen grains from yucca and agave were
not observed in the coprolite samples, indicating that the flowers from these plants
were not ingested at the time of sample deposition. Sotol pollen, however, was
observed in the coprolite samples, although the frequency with which it was observed
leaves doubt as to whether soto1 flowers were ingested. If sotol flowers were eaten
then the depostion of the cop:folites samples which contained sotol pollen most likely
took place many days after the flowers were ingested (see pollen frequency discussion
in Chapter 3).
Various seeds were dietary resources for the Baker Cave occupants. The main
seed items observed were that of the prickly pear cactus, as discussed above. Other
seeds observed included juniper, mesquite, goosefoot, pincushion cactus, mustard
family seeds, hackberry, acorn nuts, and walnuts. None of these seed remains,
however, were observed in more than three of the samples analyzed, indicating that
they were most likely not a main dietary item, but were supplements.
Pollen grains from plants which produce the smaller seeds of Chenopodium
(goosefoot) and Brassicaceae (mustard family) were observed in the samples.
Sample 18 contained a high frequency of both Cheno-am pollen and Chenopodium
seeds, suggesting that the seeds and inflorescences were eaten together. This is a
likely possibility as the small goosefoot seeds would be hard to separate from the rest
of the plant. Brassicaceae pollen was the most frequent polliniferous material ob­
served in the coprolite samples, although these same samples did not contain
Brassicaceae seeds. Brassicaceae inflorescences and seeds may have been eaten
together, with the remains showing up in different fecal samples, although evidence
is not conclusive.
The hard remains of Juniperus seed hulls and Juglans microcaropa walnut shells
indicate that these items were ground up, in order to obtain the nutritious internal
meats, and were ingested shell, hull, and all. Pollen grains from these plants were
observed in the coprolite samples, although only reflect background, or environmen­
tal, pollen.
The pollen analysis from the Baker Cave coprolites provided evidence that the
flowers, seeds, or inflorescences of certain plants were also a dietary or medicinal
item of the Baker Cave occupants. The pollen from Brassicaceae, Artemisia
(sagebrush), and Gramineae (grass family) occurred in high frequencies from the

110 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER C4 VE

samples, indicating that pollen from these plants was ingested a few days before
sample deposition.
Grass pollen and seeds have been observed in all of the lower Pecos coprolite
studies (Riskind 1970; Bryant 1974c; Williams-Dean, 1978; Stock 1983; Reinhard et
a1. 1991), indicating that this resource may have been a stable, unchanged aspect of
prehistoric lower Pecos diet. Grass seeds observed in samples from Hinds Cave,
however, have been interpreted as being accidental ingestants through rodent or bird
remains (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983).
Other pollen types were observed in the Baker Cave samples at a lower frequency
than that of Brassicaceae, Artemisia, and Gramineae. These pollen types may merely
reflect background, unintentionally ingested pollen, or they may reflect the ingestion
of flowers or inflorescences many days before sample deposition. These pollen types
included Dasylirion (sotol), high-spine Asteraceae (sunflower family), Typha (cattail),
Ephedra (mormon tea), and Lamiaceae (mint family).
The most important faunal dietary item from the coprolites was fish. The scales
extracted from the coprolites were identified as belonging mainly to the Perciformes
and the Cypriniformes family. The scales from sunfish, the salmon family (most likely
trout), and gizzard shad or threadfin shad were identified. Fish bone and scale.
remains were associated with a high frequency of charcoal, suggesting that the fish
were roasted on coals before ingestion.
The remains of rodents were also a prevalent item in the Baker Cave coprolite
samples. These remains included the bones of the mouse (Peromyscus), the wood rat
(Neotoma), and the cotton rat (Sigmodon). A large amount of rodent hair was also
observed. All parts of the rodents were represented, suggesting that they were
ingested either whole or semi-whole.
Bird bone and feathers were extracted from 16% of the Baker Cave coprolites.
Almost the entire array of bird bones were represented from these samples, indicat­
ing that birds were also ingested either whole or semi-whole. Other faunal remains
which were observed in the Baker Cave coprolites, although at very low frequencies,
included a snake vertebrae and scale, lizard bones and skin, a rabbit bone, and
unknown mammal bone.
The coprolites, however, do not reflect the entire dietary array. Larger animals,
which were not observed in the coprolites, were also important to the diet of the
Baker Cave occupants. These animals most likely include a large variety of mammals,
reptiles, and amphibians, and to a lesser degree, larger fish and bird species, as is
indicated in the faunal array from Hinds Cave (Lord 1984).

CONCLUSIONS / 111

Health

The determination of the health of the Baker Cave occupants has been attempted
through a parasitological and nutritional analysis of the latrine coprolites. It has been
suggested that the lower Pecos popUlations had a nutritionally sound diet and an
overall healthy existence, due to their stable occupation of the lower Pecos area for
over 9,000 years (Shafer 1986).
A combined analysis of 14 coprolites from Baker Cave and 25 coprolites from
Hinds Cave produced no parasite remains (Reinhard et al. 1991). This indicates that
the lower Pecos population was most likely free from the nutritional strains and
detrimental conditions associated with parasitism, although a larger sample size
needs to be analyzed to confirm or deny this. The conditions which prevent
parasitism in hunter-gatherer populations, such as the prehistoric people of the lower
Pecos, are related to behavioral and cultural activity. Such activity patterns include
nomadism, small group size, a nonagricultural subsistence base which would limit
grain storage practices, decreased occurrence of close contact between groups, and a
close association with the environment which leads to decreased occurrences of
environmental disturbance.
The nutritional analysis of the Baker Cave coprolites is only a preliminary study.
A more rigorous analysis needs to be conducted which will include many types of
ecological and cultural material from the lower Pecos area. Such analysis should
include zooarchaeological material, ethnobotanical remains, and the drinking water
content. More information on the nutritional contents of food items in the lower
Pecos region is also essential.
The preliminary nutritional analysis conducted, however, indicates that the Baker
Cave occupants, at approximately A.D. 900, were generally healthy. Their diet, as
reflected from the coprolites, contained a wide range of food items which produced
a nutritionally sufficient and stable diet. It has not been determined what the actual
diet or nutritional intake was for the lower Pecos populations year round, as
seasonality changes will affect diet and subsequently health. Skeletal information,
summarized by Steele and Olive (1989), and Reinhard et al. (1991) suggests that there
was nutritional stress in the lower Pecos population. This stress, however, was mainly
observed in the dentition, most likely from the rough, fiberous diet inherent in the
lower Pecos area, and to the high sugar and carbohydrate content of many of the food
items, such as prickly pear and mesquite.
Seasonality

The question of seasonal of occupation of specific locations is an important
consideration for archaeologists studying hunter-gatherer societies, due to the
nomadic behavior of such groups. The prehistoric peoples of the lower Pecos region
most likely practiced a seasonal, nomadic movement based on the availability of

112 I PREHISTORIC DIETATBAKER C4 VE

resources in the area (Shafer 1977, 1986). If a band stayed in one area too long the
resources, such as firewood and dietary items, would become depleted.
The lower Pecos region of Texas has subtle climatic, moisture, and temperature
changes throughout the year, erratically influencing the flowering and fruiting of the
plant species (Dering and Shafer 1976). For example, after a heavy rain wild onion
scallions (Allium drummondii) will come up, and the cenizo (Leucophyllum frutes­
cens) will bloom, becoming scarce during dry times, and sprouting again after a rain
(Shafer personal commununication, 1987). This type of behavior makes the deter­
mination of season of occupation exceedingly difficult.
The lower Pecos area has a long warm season, mainly including the spring and
summer months. In the spring and early summer onions first appear, and the blooms
from cactus and yucca flowers are prevalent. Lechuguilla, mesquite, hackberry,
mormon tea, and acacia also bloom at this time (Williams-Dean 1978; Shafer 1986).
Pine and oak pollinate during the spring and extremely high amounts of their pollen
is produced.
During the late summer months in the lower Pecos, mesquite beans are prevalent,
as well as fruits from the prickly pear cactus, hackberry, grape, yucca, and persimmon
(Williams-Dean 1978; Shafer 1986). Artemisia (sagebrush), Brassicaceae, sotol, and
high and low-spine asters bloom during the late summer and fall months.
During the fall a different variety of resources becomes available for the lower
Pecos populations. Resources that are found in the late summer and also in the fall
include prickly pear fruits, grapes, and mesquite beans. Sagebrush, sotol, Bras­
sicaceae, and Asteraceae plants all bloom during this time also. Other resources in
the fall include grass seeds, pecans, walnuts, and acorns (Williams-Dean 1978; Shafer
1986).
A few of the plants observed in the lower Pecos appear intermittently throughout
the year, or are available all year long. Williams-Dean (1978) has observed sotol and
prickly pear fruiting periodically throughout the year. Onions are also available after
heavy rains. Prickly pear cactus pads and yucca are available all year long, as well as
the leaf bases of sotol and lechuguilla (Shafer 1986). However, the leaf bases and
bulbs of lechuguilla have been identified as a winter food source (Brown 1988).
The determination of the seasonality of faunal breeding and reproduction is also
important in the analysis of seasonality because epiphyseal ends or fragments, which
represent juvenile animals, may be present in the samples. Most of the small animals
which were foraged by the lower Pecos people breed and reproduce throughout the
year, many times producing multiple litters (Schmidly 1977). Neotoma alhigula
(white-throated wood rat) has been observed to produce offspring in May, June, July,
and August, and Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse) breeds during June, July,
September, and October, producing several litters (Schmidly 1977). A few small
animals in the lower Pecos area produce young mainly during the spring season.

CONCLUSIONS I 113

These include cottontails (Sylvilagus) and Neotoma micropus (Southern plains wood
rat; Schmidly 1977).
Shafer (1986) has proposed a tentative seasonal round schedule for the lower
Pecos inhabitants, although at the present there is no archaeological evidence to
support or refute this hypothesis. Dering and Shafer (1976) have shown how difficult
it is to determine seasonality using archaeological samples, even when focussing
mainly on the plant remains. Shafer (1986) predicts that the lower Pecos peoples
inhabited the Pecos and Rio Grande canyons during the late summer. In the fall the
bands shifted to the Devils River canyons to the east, which offered a more mesic
environment as compared to the Pecos and Rio Grande canyons to the west. The
Devils River provided an abundance of acorns, walnuts, and pecans during this
season. During the winter months the people had to rely on the staples of the region;
prickly pear, sotol, and agave. Hunting became more important in providing food
resources. The bands probably moved to the northern periphery of the lower Pecos
region, which provided a larger variety of upland species.
Determining seasonality from coprolite contents is a very difficult process and
conclusions can only be tentative. The following paragraphs present an analysis of
the seasons represented by the contents of the Baker Cave coprolites. The
prevalence of Artemisia, high-spine and low-spine Asteraceae, and Brassicaceae
pollen in the Baker Cave coprolites could indicate a late summer, fall occupation, the
period when these plants normally bloom. Gramineae pollen would be available
anytime, although grass seeds, which may have been ingested with the pollen, are
mainly available in the late summer and fall.
The high percentages of background pollen types, oak (Quercus) and pine
(Pinus), in the samples could indicate a spring occupation, the flowering times of
these two species. However, these grains could also remain in the air for longer
periods of time, being recycled and incorporated on other plant food items and the
water supply.
Mesquite, prickly pear fruit, hackberry, Mammilaria, acorns, and Chenopodium
all tend to be available for consumption during the late summer and fall. Onions tend
to be available in the early warm season (spring) although they can be observed at any
time of the season after a heavy rain. Yucca, agave, prickly pear, and sotol are
available at any season, as well as the animal remains; fish, lizards, birds, mice, rats,
and rabbits.
Thus, the analysis from the coprolites suggests that during the time the latrine was
deposited, Baker Cave may have been inhabited during the late summer or fall
season. This is also evident from the large amounts of pecan and walnut shells, which
are fall items, observed in the fill of Baker Cave (Brown n.d.).
Coprolite studies conducted from Hinds Cave material, which is located on the
Pecos River, indicated a warm summer season occupation (Williams-Dean 1978;

114/ PREHISTORICDIETATBAKERC4VE

Stock 1983; Reinhard et al.1991), with the seasons divided into a warm and a cool
season (Williams-Dean 1978). Bryant (1974c) has proposed a spring, early summer
occupation for Conejo Shelter, and primarily spring and early fall occupations for
Frightful Cave occupants (Bryant 1975). Although the data are tentative, the
seasonal rounds hypothesized by Shafer (1986) may, in fact, be accurate.
Analysis of the Change in lower Pecos Diet Through Time

There has been a wide array of coprolite studies conducted on lower Pecos
material. These studies represent a time range of 8,400 years. The earliest coprolites
analyzed are from Hinds Cave (6,280 B.C.) (Stock 1983) and Frightful Cave (7,500­
5,000 B.C. ) (Bryant 1975; Fry n.d.). Time periods represented from Hinds Cave also
include 4,800-5,500 B.C. (Stock 1983), 4,000 B.c. (Williams-Dean 1978) and 2,500­
3680 B.C. (Reinhard et a1.1991). Coprolites were also analyzed from 5,000-2,000
B.C. and 2,000 B.C.-A.D. 300 from Frightful Cave (Bryant 1975; Fry n.d.). The most
recent coprolites analyzed include samples from Conejo Shelter at 500 B.C.-A.D. 800.
The present analysis of the Baker Cave coprolites (approximately A.D. 800) provides
the most recent analysis of lower Pecos diet.
With the wide range of time periods represented for coprolite analyses in the
lower Pecos, a summary of the change in diet through time can now be attempted.
The coprolite studies conducted in the lower Pecos area have already been reviewed
in Chapter I and will not be repeated here. The data observed in the Parida Cave
coprolites (Riskind 1970) will not be included in this analysis as the samples repre­
sent all levels of the cave matrix and have not been dated.
Bryant (1975) analyzed the change in diet through time of the Frightful Cave
occupants. The coprolites analyzed represent three different time periods. He ob­
served that in all of the time periods the occupants were eating flowers or
inflorescences. Opuntia pollen was very important in the early levels, as well as
Leucaena and Umbelliferae pollen. Through time other items became important in
the diet, although Opuntia pollen was not one of them. Bryant (1975) proposed from
these data that Opuntia pollen usage changed through time due to cultural change
rather than availabillity in the environment. Ingestion of other parts of Opuntia
(prickly pear) did not drop off through time, but remained a steady, stable dietary
item (Fry n.d.). Animal hair was also present in all of the macroremains (Fry n.d.),
indicating that mammals remained an important dietary item through time.
Stock (1983) conducted an extensive statistical comparison (ANOVA variance
test and Wilcoxon test) between the Hinds Cave coprolites as represented in her
study and the chronologically later samples analyzed by Williams-Dean (1978). She
observed that the incidence of overall fiber decreased through time as the number of
species used increased. Cacti and succulents remained important in the diet at all
time periods, but a general trend in the increase in the amount of constituents,
particularly fauna, rodent, and rodent hair, was observed. There were some animal

CONCLUSIONS I 115

protein and fish in the earlier time periods, although not in abundance. Bird remains
were only observed in the later period.
The pollen remains from these two studies on the Hinds Cave coprolites were not
analyzed statistically as Stock (1983) did not conduct such an analysis. Williams­
Dean (1978) noted a variety of pollen types in the coprolites, including sotol, agave,
cenizo, cactus, and prickly pear.
The Hinds Cave coprolites analyzed by Reinhard et a1. (1991) are dated slightly
later than those analyzed by Williams-Dean (1978). Reinhard also observed a variety
of economic pollen types in the coprolites. These included grass pollen aggregates
(suggesting the eating of anthers), agave, soto1, hackberry, and Lycium. Opuntia
seeds and fiber was a main constituent and bone was observed in a large portion of
the samples (64%).
The coprolites from Conejo Shelter (Bryant 1974c), are the most recent samples
analyzed outside of this study. The coprolites from Conejo Shelter mainly indicated
that the inhabitants of Conejo Shelter were eating a large amount and variety of
flowers and inflorescenses. These included yucca, agave, sotol, prickly pear, pin­
cushion cactus, persimmon, gilia, leadtree, and mesquite. Opuntia was still a main
staple in the diet, as evidenced with the fiber and seeds. Succulent fiber was also
important. The remains of mammals were observed in 23% of the samples which is
less than that observed in Hinds Cave studies (Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983).
From the analysis of a variety of coprolites from the lower Pecos area, repre­
senting a wide time range, it is indicated that prickly pear was a main dietary staple.
Evidence of prickly pear usage fiber, seeds, spines, calcium oxylate crystals, and
glochids, show up in all of the coprolite studies. Other prominent dietary items
include sotol, agave, and yucca fiber. I feel that these items were used consistently in
the lower Pecos diet through time and during all seasons.
The other dietary items observed in the coprolites tended to vary in consistency
and variety. Rodent remains were observed in all of the coprolites, although at
varying frequencies. The highest amount and variety of rodents in the diet was
observed at Hinds Cave from 6,280-4,000 B.C. Other coprolites studied indicate
rodent usage, although in lower frequencies and with less variety. Instead of dietary
change through time, the differences in rodent frequencies may indicate a difference
in rodent species distribution through time. This difference may also indicate that
larger game made up the majority of the animal protein during the other time
periods. The protein from the meat is entirely digested in the system and meat from
larger game is usually removed from the bones prior to ingestion. Thus remains from
larger animals would not be observed in coprolite material. With the exception of the
rodent remains, there tends to have been an increase in faunal diversity, mainly bird
and fish, observed through time. The Baker Cave coprolites produced the highest
incidence of fish and bird usage of the lower Pecos area. No bird remains were
observed in the early coprolite samples and fish was only observed at low frequencies.
