INTRODUCTION
Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. plans to construct a well site on the
Retrieve Unit owned by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Brazoria
County, Texas (Figure 1). The well site is 300 feet x 300 feet (2.07 acres).
Within the footprint of the well site will be a water pit and a reserve pit. The water
pit will be 20 feet by 40 feet and will be dug to a depth of six feet. The footprint of
the reserve pit will be 131 feet by 150 feet and will be dug to a depth of five feet.
Except for the borehole near the center of the well site and the two pits, the
remainder of the 2.07 acres will not be disturbed below the surface. All
construction in this area will consist of placing gravel on top of the existing
surface. The project area is in close proximity to Club Lake, a body of water
believed to be a former channel of Oyster Creek. This tract is viewed is a
medium to high probability area for the presence of a significant prehistoric site.
Therefore, an archaeological survey was recommended by the THC. Significant
archaeological sites have been recorded along this stream and oxbow lakes
associated with Oyster Creek. The project area is depicted on the Lake Jackson
topographic quadrangle (2995-122) (Figure 2).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Brazoria County is located in the southeastern part of Texas along the Gulf
of Mexico. Much of the area is defined as Gulf Coast Prairie. It is bordered by Fort
Bend, Harris, Galveston, and Matagorda counties. It covers an area of 1407
square miles. The land surface of the county is classified as broad and nearly level,
and the highest elevation in the county is Damon Mound that rises to 146 feet
above mean sea level. There are a few sloping areas that occur mainly adjacent to
major drainages such as the Brazos River, San Bernard River, and Oyster Creek.
Most drainages flow to the southeast through the major streams. Other streams
empty directly into the Gulf of Mexico or into the bays adjacent to the Gulf.
According to the soils book for Brazoria County (Crenwelge et al. 1981:1), the
inland portion of the county belongs to the Gulf Coast Prairies Major Land
Resource Area.
Project Area
The project area is located 365 meters west of Club Lake, a body of water
believed to be a former channel of Oyster Creek. The current project area is flat
and generally featureless. At the time of this survey, the area was in fallow pasture
with grasses and weeds. (Figure 3). According to the published soil survey for
Brazoria County (Crenwelge et al. 1981:33-34, Sheet 85), the project area is
located within the soil type described as Pledger clay (36), a nearly level, non-saline
soil with slopes of about 0.1 percent. Typically, this soil has a surface layer of
mildly alkaline black clay about 26 inches thick. The subsoil, to a depth of 50
inches, is moderately alkaline, calcareous, reddish-brown silty clay. This soil is
somewhat poorly drained, surface runoff is slow, and permeability is very slow.
Pledger clay soils have a perched water table above a depth of about two feet in
winter. This soil is mainly used for pasture, although grain sorghum, soybeans,
corn, and cotton are grown.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Brazoria County is located in the Southeast Texas Cultural-Geographical
Region of Texas (Figure 4) as defined by the THC in a statistical overview
published in 1985 (Biesaart et al. 1985:76). At that time, Brazoria County was fifth
in the state in terms of numbers of sites recorded (1630) and percentage of sites
recorded (8.06%). Within the region, Brazoria County was sixth with 89 sites (44%
of the state and 5.46% of the region). According to Biesaart et al. (1981:114), all
major periods of Texas prehistory were documented in Brazoria County in 1985. At
that time, 89 sites had been recorded at TARL. Of this number, 43 sites were
classified by temporal period as follows: Paleo-Indian (2 sites), General Archaic (11
sites), Middle Archaic (2 sites), Late Archaic (2 sites), and Late Prehistoric (26
sites). Information for the county in 1985 came primarily from surface collections
(79 sites). Twenty-three sites were tested by hand in 1985, 12 were excavated,
and 1 tested by machine. The archaeological potential of Brazoria County is
reflected in part by the increasing number of recorded sites found as a result of
cultural resource management studies. As a result of these investigations, the
number of recorded sites now stands at 229 sites (TARL site records). According
to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning Region of Texas
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Brazoria County is situated within the
Southeast Texas archeological study region. According to their research, site
density within the region is low at 0.001 â 0.1 sites per square mile. Threats to sites
in the area consist of mainly of urban sprawl, agriculture, and destruction by relic
collectors. Most of the archaeological surveys in the county consist of small area
surveys, many of which did not locate cultural resources. State and Federal
agencies such as the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District;
Texas Water Development Board, and Texas Department of Transportation have
been active in the county and surrounding area. The remaining studies have been
conducted by universities, private contractors, and amateur archaeologists. Most of
these projects can be found by checking the Abstracts in Texas Contract
Archeology series published by the THC (Moore 1990, 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1993,
and 1994), a bibliography of Southeast Texas (Moore 1989), the site records at
TARL, and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (hereafter referred to as the Atlas)
on the Internet.
The importance of Oyster Creek in prehistoric times is demonstrated by a
survey conducted by Moore Archeological Consulting in 1991 (Moore and Moore
1991). This study examined 750 acres adjacent to Oyster Creek and several
oxbow lakes formed when the creek (formerly the Brazos River) changed course.
In all, ten prehistoric sites were recorded. Three of these sites contained historic
components. This project was north of the current project area and adjacent to the
Texas Central Prison Farm. Of the ten prehistoric sites, three (41FB199, 41FB200,
and 41FB202) were tested (Moore 1996). Later, in advance of park construction,
data recovery was conducted at sites 41FB199 and 41FB200.

Both sites date to the Late Prehistoric period and have received the
designation of State Archeological Landmark. Site 41FB200 produced numerous
stone artifacts and ceramics. Bone preservation was excellent, and large quantities
of fish and animal bone were found as well as plant materials recovered through
flotation.
Brazoria County is one of the original Texas counties, being created and
organized in 1836. Activity in the area began in 1528 when the Spanish explorer
Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca passed through what is now Brazoria County,
probably crossing Oyster Creek, Old Caney Creek, and the Brazos and San
Bernard rivers. Other Spanish adventurers were in the region in 1689 (Alonso De
Leon) and 1727 (Joaquin de Orobio y Basterra). The first Anglos to settle the area
were immigrants to Stephen F. Austinâs colony in the 1820s. The population grew,
largely due to the importance of the Brazos River as a transportation artery.
Between 1849 and 1859, the area supported a plantation economy based on cotton
and sugar cane, and Brazoria County became the wealthiest county in Texas.
One of the early plantations was the Retrieve Plantation on Oyster Creek
four miles north of Lake Jackson. The plantation was established in 1839 by Abner
Jackson. In the beginning, Jacksonâs plantation contained a two-story mansion,
slave cabins, a sugarhouse, and an oven. All of the structures were constructed of
brick. About 1842, he sold half of his interest in the plantation to James Hamilton.
During the 1850s, the plantation produced several sugar crops, and it became one
of the largest sugar producers in Texas. Merchandise was transported by
steamboat along Oyster Creek to a point on Retrieve known as Steamboat Landing
and carried goods to and from the plantation and Lake Jackson before the Civil
War. In 1911, the land was leased and worked by hired laborers from the prison
system. The State of Texas purchased the 7424-acre plantation in 1918 and
continued to use the property as a prison farm. The Retrieve Unit has been one of
the most productive farms in the Texas prison system. The above information
regarding Brazoria County and the Retrieve Plantation was taken from The
Handbook of Texas Online. Today, the population of the county is 257,256, and the
economy is based on the petroleum and chemical industry, fishing, tourism, and
agriculture.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Atlas were
checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in the project
area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work in Brazoria
County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of prehistoric and
historic sites found in the area. In order to comply with the law, a One Dig was
performed to make sure that no buried utilities would be affected by the backhoe
trenching.
Field Survey
The Principal Investigator for this project was William E. Moore, and the
Project Archaeologist was Phillip C. Bishop. The project area was investigated by a
100% Pedestrian Survey, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching. Two backhoe
trenches and four shovel tests were excavated within the footprint of the proposed
well site (Figure 5). Following a surface inspection, four shovel tests were
excavated to depths of 20, 40, and 50 centimeters. All tests were dug through
black clay, and Shovel Test 4 was terminated when standing water was
encountered. Backhoe Trench 1 was excavated at the location of the proposed
reserve pit and was 50 feet long, 36 inches wide, 3.5 feet deep, and orientated in a
northwest-southeast direction. The soil in this area was black gumbo clay over
orange clay that dates to the Pleistocene epoch. Backhoe Trench 2 (Figure 6) was
excavated at the location of the proposed water pit and was 20 feet long, 36 inches
wide, 3.5 feet deep, and oriented in a northwest-southeast direction. The soil in this
area was black gumbo clay over orange clay that dates to the Pleistocene epoch.
Photographs of the project area were taken with a digital camera, and a hand-held
GPS was used to create waypoints to help locate the shovel tests and backhoe
trenches.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
sites have been recorded in the project area, and a professional archaeologist had
not previously examined the tract. No archaeological sites were found during the
course of this survey. The project area is located in a fallow field that was used in
the past to grow cotton. It was covered with grasses and weeds. The landform
was broad and flat and approximately 365 meters west of Club Lake, a body of
water believed to be an oxbow lake and former channel of Oyster Creek. Even
though sites have been found adjacent to oxbow lakes, the project area is not likely
to contain an archaeological site because of its distance to this body of water. The
soils in the area are black gumbo clay to a depth of 40 to 60 centimeters. Beneath
this soil is an orange clay that dates to the Pleistocene epoch. Access to the
project area is by two-track roads maintained by the prison. This survey was
conducted in accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the
THC. Additional archaeological work is not considered necessary. Therefore, it is
recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as planned.
Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the excavation
associated with the water pit or the reserve pit, all work must stop until the THC can
evaluate the situation.
