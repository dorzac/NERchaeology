Foreword
The Rise of Man
Through the various forms of life, from the
lowest microscopic single-celled organisms of both
the animal and vegetable kingdoms, up to their
apices in the huge multiple-celled aggregations of
life, such as the whale and the elephant on the one
hand, and the higher multiple-celled forms of
vegetation represented by the great oaks and elms
on the other, runs the golden thread of life; a great
mystery, as much a mystery today as when the first
brutal prototype of man began to have glimmerings
of wonder as to whence he came.
We know that certain attributes run through all
of life’s cellular structures, that these life cells are
all built up of protoplasm, a complex jelly like
substance, which always contains carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur. This
protoplasm is built up by plants alone and received
as such by all animal life. It is reasonable to
conclude therefore that plants were created first
and that all of the vast tree of life has been built on
this foundation.
Mendel’s Law
Experimentation has shown that the Mendelian
law of heredity operates in the same manner in both
plant and animal life.
Paleontology unfolds for us the leaves of the
book of life going back into the almost
imponderable hundreds of millions of years.
We see in the hot ooze of the primordial seas a
droplet of jelly charged and pulsating with life. Can
it be that all that we know as life came from this?
At any rate the rocks show successive stages of
progression from some invisible beginning up to
the culmination of all life in man.
The mind must be dull indeed which can see no
wonder and romance in the records of the earth’s
progression. Who cannot visualize, for instance,
the age of reptiles when strange vegetation covered

the earth, and yet stranger beasts shook the earth
with mighty tread, browsed from treetops; or when
the echoes roared from hill to hill while savage
reptiles, many times larger than elephants, charged
in bloody combat, bellowing thunderously and
slithering over and breaking down trees in their
monstrous rage, while overhead hissed and flapped
great satanic winged reptile dragons licking red
tongues out of long fang filled jaws; the whole a
picture more near to a real inferno than the morbid
dream of any medieval monk.
Man’s Slow Rise
Did man spring fully panoplied and equipped
into the arena of life? Again paleontology and
archeology show that his rise to civilization was
slow and painful, and probably lasted a million
years or more.
What physical attribute is there in man which
distinguishes him from the lower animals? The
answer is, the brain of man. And undoubtedly, the
attribute of the brain of man which has made him
what he is today is curiosity. When we examine
the lower animals for evidences of this trait we
find it most fully developed only among the order
of primates. With all the rest of animal creation
there seems to be little interest or curiosity
concerning anything other than the most primitive
fears and appetites. All of the order of primates,
however, manifest almost human curiosity. Also
mental tests have shown the higher forms of these
to be next to man in intelligence.
Among men it has been shown that the most
intelligent are those who maintain throughout life
the curiosity of a little child.
In Unpromising Regions
Both historic records, and research into the
prehistoric ruins of vanished civilizations, show
that owing to some unseen force, civilizations

sprang up in the most unpromising regions, grew
rapidly for a few thousands of years, and then when
racial culture had reached its flowering, the hand
that held high the torch that became the light of
the world was stilled; the jungles’ noxious growths
covered its temples, the rattlesnake wriggled over
its pavements, and the jaguar stalked through its
stately mansions.
Other hands, if not indeed other races, had
snatched the dying embers, and enkindled anew,
the light of the world flamed yet again.
This has gone on for as yet an unknown number
of thousands of years.
What is this unseen force which is behind
today’s as of all the vanished civilizations of the
past? It is the writer’s opinion that this divine flame
or ferment is present in less than a thousandth part
of the population of any race or people.
A nation’s rulers have seldom been of this
original thinker class, occasionally in the past this

has been so, and genius flowering at the head of
government for a few generations has produced
wonderful civilizations.
One Class Led
In the Egyptian, Mayan, Incan and Aztec
empires civilization flowered in the priestly class
and died with them. The priests of Spain not only
destroyed the cultured priests of the Mayan
civilization, but also all of their literature and
chronicle’s, the cultural flowering of thousands of
years. They left only the hewers of wood, and the
drawers of water, and today the descendants of
these wander stupidly among the glorious ruins
produced by their past rulers, unable either to
understand or to reproduce them. Some one has
said that any civilization could be easily destroyed
by destroying the small per cent of the population
responsible for it. Today no one knows in which
continent civilization is oldest.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
ON BAYOU MACON IN ARKANSAS
BY HARRY J. LEMLEY
Progress has been made in recent years toward
the establishment of an archaeological chronology
for the lower Mississippi Valley area. Henry B.
Collins, Jr., Jas. A. Ford and Moreau B. Chambers,
the pioneers in this task, have approached the
problem in Mississippi and Louisiana by way of “the
historic method of attack,” using potsherds found
on known historic sites as a basis, and working
backwards from the standpoint of time.
In 1925, Collins collected sherds from four
historic Choctaw sites in Eastern Mississippi (1);
in 1927-28-29, Ford and Chambers did a large
amount of exploring in the Tunica area in Western
Mississippi and collected sherds from the historic
Haynes Bluff site on the Yazoo River; in 1930,
Chambers explored and collected pottery from the
historic Natchez site on the Fatherland plantation
near Natchez, Mississippi; and in 1933 and
succeeding years, Ford collected sherds from the
historic Caddo site on the Wilkinson Place in
Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, and elsewhere in
the Caddo area in that state. Upon the pottery
collected by these gentlemen and certain vessels
exhumed by Clarence B. Moore from sites in the
area yielding trade objects, the determination of the
historic Choctaw, Natchez, Tunica and Caddo
pottery complexes is based.
In 1929, Collins, associated with Ford and
Chambers, explored the prehistoric site on the
Pepper Place near Deasonville, Mississippi, and
found sherds of a coarse ground-potsherd tempered
ware, a large per cent of which were either cord
marked or painted (2), but found no sherds of the
historic Choctaw, Tunica and Natchez complexes;
Ford and Chambers, thereafter explored ten other
prehistoric sites in Mississippi yielding a similar type
of sherds; and from this evidence the prehistoric
Deasonville complex was determined.
Along with the predominant cord marked and
painted ware discovered at Deasonville, some
sherds bearing a different type of decoration

AND

characterized by overhanging lines parallel to the
rim, and resembling somewhat the pottery of the
West and Northwest Florida coast, were found.
These were of a style similar to sherds found by
Ford and Chambers on prehistoric sites in Western
Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana. This complex,
the Coles Creek, Ford states was first recognized
at a site on Coles Creek near Fayette, Mississippi
(3). On the Coles Creek sites at least a few of the
Deasonville sherds were found, and vice versa,
thereby indicating that the two complexes were
contemporaneous, at least in some areas.
Upon certain of the type sites of the prehistoric
Deasonville and Coles Creek complexes a few
sherds decorated either with “smooth bands
outlined by incised grooves” with a roughened
background, or by “deeply incised concentric and
parallel lines closely spaced,” were found. These
were of the type of ware unearthed by Fowke (4)
in 1926, and later by Setzler, at the prehistoric site
near Marksville, Louisiana, Setzler having
recognized in the meantime that the pottery
exhumed by Fowke was of the Hopewell culture
found in Southern Ohio and adjacent areas (5). To
this complex of the Southern aspect of the
Hopewellian phase the name of “Marksville” has
been given. A few village sites, predominantly
Marksville, have been explored by Ford in
Louisiana.
In 1933, in excavating a deep midden on the
Peck Place near Sicily Island, Louisiana, yielding
sherds of the Deasonville, Coles Creek and
Marksville complexes, Ford (6) secured evidence
indicating that pottery of the Marksville complex
was in use, at least by the people who made refuse
deposits in a part of the midden, at an earlier period
than that of the Deasonville and Coles Creek.
From the data obtained as a result of the
explorations above mentioned, Ford in his “Outline
of Louisiana and Mississippi Pottery Horizons” (7)
has suggested a chronology of three pottery

Archeological Investigations On Bayou Macon
sequences for Louisiana and Mississippi; the latest,
Choctaw, Natchez, Tunica and Caddo complexes;
the intermediate, Deasonville and Coles Creek; the
oldest, Marksville. Accompanying his paper is a map
showing the distribution of these
pottery complexes within those parts
of the states of Louisiana and
Mississippi so far explored.

of a late prehistoric culture and resembling the
pottery of the Tunica complex, was found with
burials. In a few instances this ware was with vessels
related to pottery of other types found elsewhere

Incident to the problem of
establishing a chronology is the
determination of the area covered by
each complex and the intrusion of
other complexes therein.
The Caddo complex, as is well
known, extends into Arkansas and
Texas. Moore (8) and Harrington (9)
found Caddo ware almost exclusively
in the Red and Ouachita River Valleys
in South central and southwest
Arkansas, and Jackson (10) and Pearce
(11) in a part of the Red River area of
Northeast Texas. Pottery of the Coles
Creek complex, but in some details
suggestive of Marksville, was found
by Lemley (12) in 1935 with burials at
the prehistoric Crenshaw site on Red
River, Miller County, Southwest
Arkansas. In certain mounds on this
site vertical stratigraphic evidence was
obtained of occupancy by the
Caddoes, and also by a pre-Caddo
group who buried vessels of the Coles
Creek complex with their dead. The
relationships of this ware were
discussed by Dickinson in Vol. 8 of this
bulletin (13). No pottery of the
Deasonville complex was discovered
on the Crenshaw Place.
In 1934, the writers of this paper
undertook a joint expedition into the
Bayou Macon area in Southeast
Arkansas, headed by S. D. Dickinson.
Two months were devoted to the
project. In mounds on various
prehistoric sites in that section, shell
tempered ware, believed to have been

were plain except for a rather indistinct
undecorated band encircling the rim and
outlined below by a faint line; many of
them bore the cord marked decoration
of the Deasonville complex; a very few,
the typical decorations of the Marksville
complex; one of the sherds had deeply
incised overhanging lines parallel to the
rim (Coles Creek); and several of the
undecorated rim sherds bore projections
or lugs. A few of the sherds were covered
both inside and out with a light red slip.
These potsherds of the older complexes
from the Hog Lake site were similar in
most details to those found by us on
other sites hereinafter mentioned, and
their types are discussed more fully in
our classification of the sherds from the
Alma Brown place, infra.
The most abundant surface remains
on the entire site were on the Parnell
plantation south of the Medley line, but
extensive digging here uncovered but
one burial, a poorly preserved one found
just beneath the surface. The plow had
apparently destroyed the remaining
burials at this point. This skeleton, an
adult, measured 5’ and was extended on
its back with head to the northwest and
arms crossed on its breast. No furniture
was found with the burial. A number of
Deasonville sherds were found in the
digging around the skeleton, but none
of the later complex. About 50’
northwest of the burial was a refuse pit.
A number of cord marked Deasonville
sherds were in this pit and at the bottom
of it were the remains of a large square
bottomed pot, V-1177, of heavy, plain
dark gray-brown, grit tempered ware,
which has since been restored (catalog,
rather than field numbers of artifacts, are
given). This vessel probably belongs to
the Deasonville complex, since sherds of
that complex only were found in the trash
pit.

A house site, the hard packed, irregularly shaped
floor of which measured 11’ x 7 ½’ was discovered
about 200 yards south of the burial referred to. At
the time of the destruction of the dwelling the walls
had collapsed and had fallen on the floor. The
plastering was 4” in thickness. Immediately south
of the house were the remains of rotted poles. There
was no evidence of a fireplace within the dwelling,
neither could any opening be seen. Cord marked
and plain heavy sherds were found around the sides
and beneath the floor, but none of the later complex.
Similar sherds were also found in a small mound
on the Parnell plantation north of the Medley line,
but no burials.

In two mounds on the Medley Place and in
cemeteries on the Jones and Parnell Places, burials,
which we believe to be Tunican, were found.

burials were found in his “Roberts Covered Mound,

Covered Mound, 1” (21).
The sherds gathered throughout the digging in
this mound were shell tempered and of Tunica ware.
We secured a vessel, V-1093, from Medley, which

of 1933. It is a small pot of heavy polished black
ware, the rim of which is decorated with a band of

Burial No. 6 contained an adult extended,
parallel to and about 9’ southwest of No. 5, and
was headed northwest. It had been struck by the
plow. A flint chipping outfit was at the left of the
skull. This kit consisted of 3 pieces of sandstone, 2
bone tools used in flaking, 2 antler tips, 2 poorly
wrought arrow-heads, 24 pieces of jasper, 2
hammer stones, a piece of slate, and a conglomerate.
A refuse pit containing sherds of the later complex
was discovered between burials Nos. 5 and 6.

At Bellaire, on the Parnell Plantation, about
three-quarters of a mile west of the Hog Lake site,
is a mound approximately 80’ in diameter and 12’
high. This mound had been previously dug into and
was badly damaged. A day was spent in digging
into parts of the tumulus for the purpose of
ascertaining whether it had been used by the people
of the older or later culture. A few sherds of Tunica
ware only were found. This site was formerly a part
of a plantation owned by Mrs. James A. Anderson.

Muskhogean type as those under discussion. In this
connection, it is also of interest to note that in the
Smith mound, in the same valley, Ford and
Chambers found with early Tunica ware a red and
white quadrilateral square bottomed vessel, having
terraced sides, similar in shape to one found by
Moore, (31) at Moundville.
Westlake Place
We also investigated a site situated at the mouth
of Lost Chain, a stream emptying into Bayou Macon
in Desha County, Arkansas, upon which site there
are two mounds. The eastern part of the site,
including one of the mounds, is on the farm of Lizzie
Wilson, who refused permission to excavate. This
mound was about 40’ in diameter and 3’ high and
had been washed by the 1927 flood. Sherds of the
later complex were found on its surface. The rest
of the site, with the remaining mound, is on the
Westlake place situated in the E½ of NE¼, Sec.
29, Twp. 13 S., R. 2 West. This mound, measuring
approximately 35’ in diameter and 2’ in height, was
completely explored by us. The following described
burials were found; all of the burials, with the
exception of the bunched burial later referred to,
were extended on their backs at depths averaging
about 2 ½’; the bones in all instances were in poor
condition:
Burial No. 1, measuring 5’, was in the center of
the mound, headed west. At the right of the skull
was a cooking pot, V-1139, of heavy plain dark
gray-brown ware, with a circular opening, square
bottom and rudimentary feet.
Burial No. 2, 4’ east of No. 1 and headed west,
was 4’ in length no artifacts.
Burial No. 3, about 11” north of No. 1, included
two adults headed north, side by side, respectively
6’ and 5’ in length, and a bunched burial. The
bunched burial was placed to the right of the leg
bones of the shorter skeleton. No offerings.

19

Burial No. 4, about 3’ northeast of No. 3 and
headed east, was 5’ in length. At the left of the skull
was a small, crude, semi-globular bowl, V-1138, of
thick, grit tempered, light brown ware, having two
holes placed oppositely at the rim.
Considerable digging in the field failed to
disclose other burials. Many sherds of the
Deasonville and a few of the Marksville complex
were found on the surface of the Westlake place. A
polished, red jasper knife with a curved blade, 3”
in length, was found on the surface of the Wilson
place.
Gibson Mound
An investigation was made of a small mound in
the woods on the Henry Gibson place, situated near
Bayou Macon in the W½ of NE¼ of Sec. 21, Twp.
13 S., R. 2 West, Desha County, Arkansas. This
mound, approximately 58’ in diameter and 5’ high,
had been partially explored by Mr. Kelley. He
reported having found in the center several bunched
burials, with pottery. The vessels discovered by
him are of the Tunica complex. Undisturbed parts
of the mound were dug into by us. Certain artifacts,
but no burials, were found.
In the northeastern part of the mound, 6” under
the surface, was a pot, V-1136, having certain Coles
Creek characteristics. This vessel is of heavy, brown,
grit tempered ware and has a circular opening and
a square bottom. It is decorated with a wide
encircling -band enclosed in incised horizontal lines.
Within this band is a design composed of diagonal
lines forming irregular triangular figures, with
interspaces filled with punctations formed by a blunt
pointed tool inserted at an angle. In the southeastern
part of the mound, at a depth of about 2’, were
three vessels: a large, shallow undecorated bowl of
thin, yellow ware; part of a smaller bowl of plain,
dark gray pottery; and a semi-globular bowl of
porous yellow paste, upon one side of the rim of
which is a triangular projection similar in shape to
the conventionalized tails appearing on effigy bowls
found farther north in the Mississippi valley. The
opposite side of the rim is missing but doubtless it
contained the head of the effigy. On the north side

technique” (32). This object and a large fragment
of a somewhat similar one, U-160, found by us in a
shallow refuse pit on the Brown place containing
sherds of the Deasonville complex, remain
unclassified. An illustration of both is given.
Specimen U-160 is similar in size and material to
U-159, but is more rounded. It is 7/8” thickness,
and is flat on one side and slightly convex on the
other. It also is well baked and contains on both
sides deeply incised, but carelessly executed,
decorations resembling each other in design. But
for the fact that no stamped ware was found on
Bayou Macon, we might classify these as pottery
stamps. It has been suggested that they may have
been used as gaming discs. Clay discs resembling
these were found by de Booy in the Salado caves
of Eastern Santo Domingo (33). The similarity
between our specimen U-159 and those illustrated
in his Figure 27 (op. cit. p. 95) is striking. The
designs, which are incised in both instances, appear
to be practically the same. In certain of his discs,
including those just referred to, both sides bear the
same decoration, as is the case with ours. In others,
however, there is an incised design on one side and
a small animal effigy in low relief (op. cit., pi. IX),
on the other, within the body of which is a hollow
space forming a receptacle for pebbles. De Booy
classifies all of these discs as stamps, and suggests
that those containing pebbles served both as stamps
and as rattles.

The four mounds on the Brown place, all of
which are roughly circular, are approximately 119’,
90’, 85’ and 25’ in diameter. The time that we could
devote to our investigation had about expired, and
no attempt was made to explore these mounds.
Some digging however, was done in the two smaller
ones, which were but a few feet apart and may, at
one time, have been one mound. The smallest
yielded 2 vessels and no burials. On its northeastern
side at a depth of 1 ½’ was a badly crushed, friable
square bottomed pot, having a circular opening and
decorated below the rim with a wide encircling band
of nested triangles containing parallel lines. About
2’ east of this vessel was a medium sized pot, V1223, of heavy ware, modeled in the shape of an
inverted truncated cone and decorated with closely
spaced parallel vertical ridges made by pinching the
wet clay between the finger tips. Remains of a light
red slip are upon both the interior and exterior of
this vessel. A number of test holes were made in
the other mound last referred to, and on its eastern
side at a depth of about 2’ an urn, with no evidence
of a burial, was discovered. This vessel, V-1222, is
of thin, polished brown ware, and is decorated

Sherds of the earlier culture, all from pots and
bowls but none from bottles, were found in this
cemetery and in shallow refuse heaps nearby and
on the surface of the area mentioned. The unusual
clay object, U-160, above described, was
discovered in one of these middens. These sherds,
which are of the same general types as those of the
older culture found on the Hog Lake and other sites
investigated by us, are not only capable of being
classified into complexes, but also to some extent
into sub-types. For such a classification we have
selected 406, being all of those saved from the
Brown place except undecorated body sherds,
which were plentifully distributed over the area.
Sherds of the Deasonville Complex

The cord marked rim sherds fall into four classes:
(a) plain, of which there are 9, (b) notched, 7, (c)
banded, 7, and (d) banded and notched, 9. In “a”
the cord marking extends upward to an undecorated
rim lip; in “b” the rim is identical with “a” except
that the lip is notched (the notches in some cases
appearing on the outer edge only, in others
extending across the lip); in “c” a raised band
varying from 5/8” to 1 1/2” in width encircles the
rim (this band having been formed in most instances
by purposely failing to smooth out completely the

than any other. Ford, in his analysis now being
published, lists the following among others as
characteristics of Tunica ware: (a) in vessel shapes:
bottles, shallow concave bowls, beakers and effigy
vessels; (b) in paste: shell tempered and light porous
gray or black ware; (c) in pottery decorations: small
ridges raised by pinching, “U” shaped festoons of
incised lines, herringbone design, scrolls formed by
numerous lines, interior decorations of straight lines,
and brush markings made with bundles of fibers.
These characteristics are in evidence on some of
the entire vessels found by us. On the other hand, a
number of the distinguishable features of Tunica
pottery found elsewhere are missing, such as pots
with handles, knobs, Decorated outflaring lips, and
fairly hard gray or brown ware; and, as has been
seen, Caddo and other outside influences are
manifest. On the whole, our vessels of the later
period, with the exception of those showing such
influences, appear to be more nearly akin to the
pottery found by Ford and Chambers on the Dupree,
Gross, Smith and Pocohontas sites in the Big Black
River Valley of Mississippi than any other. The burial
customs of the two peoples are also similar. In Big
Black Valley, Ford and Chambers (as detailed in
Ford’s analysis referred to) found skull burials with
the usual burial furniture but lacking the rest of the
bones, burials extended on their backs, and flexed
burials. Our assignment of the ware to the Tunica
complex is based mainly upon the foregoing
considerations.

Apparently the Coles Creek complex did not
manifest itself as the Deasonville complex did in
this region. Only two sherds that might be definitely
classified as Coles Creek were found during the
entire stay on Bayou Macon. These are of one Coles
Creek type of decoration only, that is “incised
encircling lines parallel to the rim.” In one of these
sherds the lines are not “overhanging.” The vessel
V-1136 from the Gibson Mound has characteristics
of this complex, but it is by no means typically Coles
Creek.

The sherds we have assigned to the Deasonville
complex differ in some respects but resemble in
others the ware found by Chambers at Deasonville.
A number of our plain and cord marked rim sherds
display notches and a raised encircling band; none
such are illustrated by him. Collins found red and
white painted ware at Deasonville. We collected
some red slipped sherds (one of Ford’s “marker”
types of the Deasonville complex) but no painted
specimens. Ford says that the pottery found at the
Deasonville site is slightly typical of the complex
to which that name has been given, and notes that
red and white painted ware has not always been
found associated with the cord marked pottery of
this complex. Collins found sherds bearing lugs and
handles, but these appendages were restricted to
shell tempered vessels decorated with punctations
or incised lines. We have seen illustrations only of
Collins’ pottery and have not had the opportunity
to examine any of the actual ware itself. However,

Excavation of Murrah Cave

27

EXCAVATION OF MURRAH CAVE
BY W. C. HOLDEN
Murrah Cave is located in Val Verde County, on
the lower Pecos River, approximately fifteen miles
from the Rio Grande as the crow flies, and some
twenty-five or thirty miles as the river winds. The
Pecos, in this vicinity, makes a number of horseshoe bends which have diameters ranging from
three-quarters of a mile to two miles. The cave is
in the east bank, facing west, of one of these bends
whose circular side is to the east. The river in this
region has cut several hundred feet through the
Comanchean limestone. The east bank, on the
outside curve, is practically perpendicular, with
overhanging ledges here and there, and some debris,
and very steep, near the base.
A number of caves of varying sizes are found in
this bank, but Murrah Cave, the largest of them all,
is the only one with evidence of prehistoric
occupation. It is located approximately two hundred
feet above the water level of the river, and sixty
feet from the top of the cliff. It extends back into
the cliff one hundred and twenty-four feet, is
twenty-four feet wide at its mouth, thirty-five feet
wide at a distance of forty-five feet from the
entrance, thirty-seven feet wide at sixty feet from
the entrance, and forty-five feet wide at one hundred
feet from the entrance. Toward the back it narrows
down abruptly to a passage-way only a few feet
wide which extends some twenty-four feet farther.
The floor has only a slight dip downward for fifty
feet where the decline becomes approximately thirty
percent to the rear. The ceiling in the mouth of the
cave is nine feet and six inches from the floor. It is
almost level for about eighty feet back where it
begins tilting downward. Toward the rear it is
approximately twenty-five feet from the floor.
Human occupation was confined largely to the
comparatively level stretch of floor in the front fifty
feet. Behind this the bats have lived, and the guano
is from two to three feet deep. (See Plate 7).

century. In March, 1936, Mr. W. G. McMillan and
the writer, accompanied by Mr. Puckett, visited the
cave for two days. A survey convinced us that the
site was rich in materials and had been molested
very little. Permission was granted by Mr. Jim
Murrah, the owner, to excavate the place.
We began planning an expedition for March,
1937. This season was selected as a time when
rattlesnakes would not be so active as later in the
spring, and when the weather would be neither too
hot nor too cold. As it happened, both predictions
turned out contrary to plans; we killed a rattler
under foot while eating supper one night, and two
days and nights we nearly froze, while one day was
as hot as in May.
The expedition was sent out under the auspices
of the West Texas Museum which, in turn, is under
the joint control of Texas Technological College
and the West Texas Museum Association. The
sponsors who financed the expedition were Mr. W.
G. McMillan, Dr. C. J. Wagner, Mr. H. L. Allen,
and the writer.1 These gentlemen, with the exception
of Mr. Allen, accompanied the party. In addition
was Mr. W. L. Pearson, electrical engineer, and six
students: Henry Clay Bailey III, Clifford Gibbs,
Barney McCasland, Gordon Moore, Jim Huffman,
and Winston Reeves. Mr. Reeves, a photographer
of considerable skill, made an excellent series of
pictures. The writer made the tenth member of the
expedition. Dr. John Clark, field paleontologist of
Texas Technological College, visited the site for a
short time.2

The inaccessibility of Murrah Cave made it
necessary to camp on a high rocky point several
hundred feet above the river, and a mile from the
cave. All the equipment for the cave, including the
wheelbarrows, had to be carried on our backs down
a deep canyon, up over a high ridge, down another
steep decline, and along a narrow ledge high on

well over a road which did not exist. In the camp,
not a single tent stake could be driven. It was
necessary to tie the tents to cacti, lechuguilla,
juagilla, sotol, and the other scant shrubs of desert
vegetation.

The ash heap in the forward fifty feet
of the cave varied from eighteen inches
to fifty-two inches in thickness. The
ashes were light, dry, and dusty. It was
necessary for members of the party to
wear respirators while working.
Without a respirator, one would choke
up in a few moments.
The heap was worked in three levels.
The first two levels were worked over
the entire area. When it became evident
that we would be unable to finish the
entire heap during our allotted time, we
made two trenches to the floor, one
along each side of the cave. The
trenches constituted the third level, and
gave us a representative sample of the
bottom layer. Materials from these
levels were carefully kept segregated
in order to determine whether or not
any kind of cultural change had taken
place from the bottom to the top. When

Fist Axes

Uncatalogued Flint Artifacts

Of fist axes, there were 58. These vary in length
from two and one-half inches to four inches. There
is considerable variation in shape and technique.
None show evidence of having had handles. (See
plate 8B, picture 2).

There were found 1,562 flint objects which were
not catalogued. This number included broken
projectile points other than bases, knives, scrapers,
gouges, fist axes, awls, and other unclassified items.
Many of these broken specimens are of excellent
shape and workmanship.
Pebbles

Flint Awls
Four whole awls and two broken ones were
secured. One of the whole awls had a corner-tang.
(See plate 9B, pictures 1, 2, 3, and 6).
War-Club Spikes
It is problematical whether any war spikes were
found. Two specimens may have been spikes, or
they may have been the points of broken awls. (See
plate 9B, pictures 4 and 5).
Bone Crushers

A considerable number of pebbles were found
throughout the deposit. Some 29 specimens show
evidence of having been used for rubbing. One
pebble has incised marks on it. These, however, do
not make any symbol or design.
Stone Objects
Eighteen manos were secured, but no metate
was found. This is singular in that Pearce and
Jackson got thirty-two in their rockshelter. One

something highly prized by the prehistoric
inhabitants of the cave. Professor W. I. Robinson,
Mineralogist of the Department of Geology, Texas
Technological College, examined the specimen,
found it to be non-magnetic, yet it gives a red iron
nitrate stain when touched with nitric acid. Its
specific gravity is 3.7. By grinding it with an
abrasive, it gives off a yellow powder. Professor
Robinson is of the opinion that the specimen is
limonite. He suggested that the fact a yellow
pigment could be obtained from a black mineral
was surprising enough to be regarded as magic by
the aborigines. (See plate 9A, picture 13. The highlight in the picture makes the black metallic ball
appear as a bead).

Human Jaw

No burials were found, however, it is possible
that some may be found in the area still to be
excavated. The only evidence of human bones was
an articular end of a lower jaw. It is significant that
this fragment was charred. This might denote one
of three facts: attempts at cremation, cannibalism,
or carelessness in handling of skeletal material by
the ancients.
Paint

Forty-one specimens of a red clay paint were
secured, the most of them were either on, or in the
vicinity of the loin cloth mentioned below.
Associated with the red clay were a number of
pieces of soft, chalky limestone which, no doubt,

A considerable use was made of leaves, split
leaves, or fibers, in the tying of bundles. The blades

of sotol, lechuguilla, Spanish dagger, and sacahuiste
(Nolina texana Watson) were used. Of 155 knots,
109 are square knots; the others were not classified.
(See plate 12A, pictures 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

12A, picture 12, is quite a mystery. It consists of a
net made of hundreds of fibers tied together with
square knots. Through the center of the net is a
lechuguilla blade bent double, with the two ends
tied together at the bottom. The specimen is five
and one-half inches long, and has a fan-like
appearance. As yet we are at a loss as to its use.
Dr. R. A. Studhalter suggested it might have been
a strainer. It might also have been an ornament for
the hair.

A considerable number of Texas laurel or coral
beans (Sophora secundiflora), seeds, and pods were

however, a majority of those secured were parched.
In view of the fact that the seeds are poisonous,
one wonders at their presence in the cave. Pearce
and Jackson give a plausible explanation.9
That the prehistoric cave dwellers liked a little
seasoning with their food is attested by the presence
of a number of small wild onions.
A few acorns, most of them parched, were found.
Three species of grass seeds (as yet unidentified)

associated with the loin cloth shown on plate 11A.

Perhaps the most intriguing objects found were
two needle or spine containers. Each was made of
a bundle of soft fibers wrapped cross-wise with fiber
thongs. One (Plate 12B, picture 6) contained ten
fish-hook cactus spines. These may have been used
as fishhooks or as needles. The other bundle
contained four straight cactus spines (Plate 12B,
picture 7). Both bundles are examples of
exceedingly delicate workmanship.
Conclusion
All the evidence indicates that the inhabitants of
Murrah Cave were prehistoric. Nothing was found
to indicate they had ever come in contact with
European civilization. If the last persons to live in
the cave left before the arrival of the white race,
one may surmise from the amount of ashes that the
first inhabitants date back a considerable period
before the beginning of historic time. The people
had primarily a sotol culture, and were entirely
without pottery. Their skill lay in the making of
cordage and exquisite flint artifacts.

Western Plains and were wrongly named “Folsom decadence in workmanship in some regions or in
points.” I first called attention to their differences some phase of the culture, or also possibly material
and later named that new group by the generic term of less quality.

Folsom and Yuma Points As Known Today
Besides this common trait in pressure flaking
technique and its frequent excellence, the Yuma and
Folsom points share in two blade shapes, the one
with parallel edges (Type 1) and the other with more
or less convex sides (Type 2). They also have in
common some points with straight bases, and many
with concave bases. However, the “squarish” and
the “wavy” base types are reserved to the Folsom
points and the convex bases rare on Yuma points
are never seen on Folsom specimens, as far as I
know. And, whereas the stemmed type is one of
the Yuma complex, the longitudinal groove is the
strict and distinct feature of the Folsom points.
By the way, the term point is used here to
designate a “pointed blade” as already described,
and refers, principally, to the shape without
prejudice of the use or destination of the artifacts.
By reason of their form and size, and still more
convincingly due to the fact that they were several
times found in close connection with bones of
animals, it seems obvious that they must have been
used as weapon points for hunting and in war. But
this purpose need not be exclusive as some blades
would make efficient knives, others could function
as side scrapers, and a few are pointed enough to
be occasionally used as borers. Unfortunately, at
the beginning, some persons untrained in
archaeology called Folsom and even Yuma points
“arrowheads.” It clearly seems that most of those
specimens are too large and too heavy to he
properly shot as arrowheads with the ordinary
Indian bow, except, possibly, the smallest Folsom
points. Moreover, if the Yuma-Folsom weapon
points really are as old as claimed by some scientists
worthy of our confidence, they obviously cannot
be arrowheads, as the invention or introduction of
the bow and arrow in America, according to present
evidence, seems much more recent. On the other
hand, judging from their shape, size and antiquity,
the Folsom and Yuma points can more logically be
considered as heads or points for darts, assagis or
javelins, or even lance or spear, some of these
weapons being held firmly in hand by their shafts,
others being thrown by hand or otherwise.

to the definition previously given in order to discuss
the different varieties. My typology of the Yuma
point was, at first, purely empirical, that is to say,
only based on the observation of shapes so far
found. Happily the relatively small group of
specimens then on hand turned out to contain
practically all varieties ever discovered. Thus, as
early as my first paper published in January, 1931,
was I able to establish a descriptive terminology
and a basic typology, which has endured to date,
with only the addition of a sub-type of stemmed
point later recognized. The definition of the Yuma
points proposed at the Symposium of the Antiquity
of Man, held at Philadelphia, last March on the
occasion of the 125th anniversary of the founding
of the Academy of Natural Sciences, practically is
a summary description of the types which I have
presented in several papers. Let us pass them rapidly
in review.
First, the blade types: Type 1 has straight or
nearly straight and parallel edges. Type 2 has more
or less convex sides, with base from slightly
narrower than the maximum breadth of the blade
to base very narrow or constricted, thus forming
respectively sub-type 2-a and sub-type 2-b. Type 3
comprises the elongated, sharp tipped, triangular
points of sub-type 3-a and the much more rare
points of sub-type 3-b with a squarish base, broader
than the blade. Some implements of this last variety
seem to have been used as alternate scrapers and
possibly borers; in other words they may be more
exactly called tools than weapon points. In the same
manner, as already suggested, artifacts of types 1
and 2 could make serviceable knife blades when
properly hafted for that purpose. Type 4 is reserved
for stemmed points. It is divided into two styles:
sub-type 4-a, lanceolate points with a stem rather
narrow and fairly thick, and with rounded shoulders,
whereas sub-type 4-b is a blade of type 1 or 2 with
a stem of same thickness and surface flaking, in
most cases, as the body of the point and only a few
millimeters narrower.

All points of types 1, 2, and 4, have a lenticular
or bi-convex cross-section. Points of type 3, being

PLATE 13.
Blade and Base Types of Folsom and Yuma Points.

Folsom and Yuma Points As Known Today
to develop a dorsal ridge, lengthwise along the
middle part of the two faces. This lateral contraction
coupled with the median thickening causes the
cross-section to assume a lozengic shape. On the
contrary, as already said, the typical Folsom point
owing to the removal of a broad and relatively deep
spall on both faces has a bi-convex cross section
with lateral ridges.
Not much can be added to the typology of the
Folsom points as it has been stated in the definition
that it is a pointed blade with either fairly straight
and parallel or with convex edges. The tip is often
more rounded as in types 1 and 2 than truly sharp,
and never acute as in type 3. The only thing to
discuss is the characteristic grooving. In any fairly
extensive series one will at once notice the variety
of length, breadth and regularity of the longitudinal
groove. Although most of the specimens are
“fluted” on both faces, a few have only one
lengthwise groove. In some cases it appears obvious
that the first spall removed went deeper than
anticipated and left the blade too thin to attempt
flaking a second one off the other face. Other times
the reason is not obvious. On some pieces the
grooves are neither as long nor as broad on both
faces, and, the same as on other specimens. They
are irregular in shape and direction, not following
the long axis of the blade, they are “wavy” in depth
and contour like a poorly struck flake. Only in the
best points, and such pieces are not rare, do we see
the grooves skillfully made very nearly similar in
shape and dimensions on both faces of the blade.
In such cases the fluting extends almost to the tip
of the point and the edges of the groove are parallel,
or nearly so, with the sides of the blades and thus
they form a lateral ridge with a gentle slope both
ways, toward the sharp edge of the point and the
central groove.
If one arranges a series of Folsom specimens,
designated as type 5 in our scheme of classification,
according to the length of the longitudinal groove,
sub-types can be established for the sake of
convenience in describing these points and their
characteristic “channel.” Some Yuma points, it
might be remarked at the start, display a thinning
of the base by means of marginal retouch or small

41

flakes removed apparently to facilitate hafting. The
same reason seems to have inspired the ancient
artifact maker to strike off the base line, usually
concave, of some Folsom points a few narrow and
more or less long flakes on one or both faces, or
else one broader, scale-like flake. This would be a
natural extension of the previously noted practice
of thinning the base. Such specimens will be pooled
into our sub-type 5-a, with flakes or grooves not
exceeding about one-third of the length of the blade.
Then there is a group of points with grooves more
or less irregular in shape and proportions, some
broad from even the base line, others and more
numerous ones, a narrower start and a progressive
broadening, but in either case not longer than
approximately one-half the total length of the piece.
This, which seems to mark an advance in the skill
or daring of the prehistoric weapon maker, may be
termed sub-type 5-b. Sub-type 5-c is reserved to
points with a channel or groove covering at least
two-thirds of the length of the blade; a few are even
longer and in some instances the workman overshot
his mark and the flake removed goes from base line
to tip of the point, making it very thin. In fact, if
the first flaking off of the blades from the base was
in order to help in mounting it on a shaft, the
increase in the length and breadth of the spall must
have been done to reduce weight. Finally, the
Folsom man, having fully mastered the art of
producing this daring fluting, manufactured elegant
points, shapely and light, but the excess in removing
a long and broad spall weakened his weapon point.
This is proved by the large number of fragments
found, either tips or the portion of the basal section
held by the shaft end. Such things could not stand
the impact when the point struck its aim. It may be
in search of a remedy to this fragility that the Folsom
points of that beautiful sub-type 5-c are smaller than
most other Yuma and Folsom types, even reaching
such a short size, although often relatively broad,
that they could be used as missiles shot with a bow.
Several facts postulate a close relation, between
Yuma and Folsom points. First, they both were
made by means of the same skillful pressure method.
Second, they have in common the shapes of types
1 and 2, and the straight and more often concave
base forms. Third, the thinning of the base seen on

42

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

many Yuma artifacts seems to be the starting point
of the increasingly more daring and skillful flaking
of a longitudinal groove becoming the main
characteristic of the Folsom points without which
it often could not be distinguished from a Yuma
specimen. Every step of the progressive evolution
from a plain Yuma of type 1 or 2 to a fully developed
Folsom of our sub-type 5-c can be followed on
specimens of a representative collection. Fourth,
on points with only one groove the other face has
the same appearance of flaking as a Yuma blade;
on specimens with short and irregular grooves, the
rest of both faces is again such as seen on Yuma
points; a couple of pieces with a single groove
showed a “hinge fracture” which spoiled the work
and explains why the specimen was left unfinished
and rejected. On a Yuma point an unsuccessful
attempt had been made to remove a spall in order
to fashion it into a Folsom point. Finally, at several
sites, attentive observers collected finished Folsom
artifacts and the spall which had been struck off in
order to produce the characteristic longitudinal
groove. When placed back on the piece, it filled
the channel; the Folsom point was again a Yuma
point. Nothing could prove more conclusively the
morphological and probably cultural relation of the
two types. It also clearly suggests that the simpler
and generalized Yuma must have preceded, as a
type and as an individual point, the more highly
specialized Folsom point. It does not preclude the
possibility of their coexistence in the same culture
or even in time in two cultural phases of different
distributions, one remaining with Yuma only and
the other evolving the Folsom type. Further field
work is needed to establish their actual
chronological relation. It can be settled by
uncovering Yuma and Folsom specimens together
in clearly stratified sites; also in comparing the
species of animals whose bones are seen in close
association with the different types of points. Then
and only then, after the correct interpretation of
facts has been made, will we be able objectively to
accept or reject the conclusions suggested by
typological observations.
It is a bad practice in taxonomy to multiply
uselessly the number of types and their subdivisions.
It causes confusion for the amateur and annoying

complexity for the field and the museum men. A
classification must be simple, logical and objective;
it must overlook individual variations and small
local peculiarities. To create as many types as there
are possibilities of combination of blade types with
base types is undesirable in its impractical
multiplicity and unwarranted by the very small
number of specimens for each of the numerous
classes. However, it may be interesting to note the
association of base types with blade types.
On the basis of the inspection of 348 Yuma and
119 Folsom points the following percentage of base
types were observed. It was found that these Yuma
points had 31.03 per cent base type A, or straight,
36.49 per cent base sub-type B-1 or slightly concave
and 29.02 per cent sub-type B-2 or deeply concave,
with only 3.44 per cent of D type or convex. The
Folsom points showed the small percentage of 4.20
with a straight base; then 20.16 per cent, with
slightly concave bases, but the large proportion of
63.86 per cent with deeply concave bases and 11.7
per cent of concave bases with a squarish or wavy
line. In other terms pooling together all concave
base forms we have 65.51 per cent for Yumas and
the enormous percentage of 95.78 for Folsoms
which makes it truly typical for those points.
Going a step further we may inquire as to the
association of base types with point types and subtypes. On the basis of our records of past years we
have following figures. Blade type 1, with parallel
sides, 11 straight and 30 concave bases; type 2,
with convex edges, 48 straight, 133 concave and
five convex bases; type 3, or triangular points, 15
straight, 52 concave and 4 convex bases; sub-type
4-a, or lanceolate points with narrow stem, 6
straight and 5 concave bases; and sub-type 4-b, or
blades with a broad stem, 28 straight, 18 concave
and 3 convex bases. For the Folsom points we have:
sub-type 5-a, with very short groove, 43 concave
base and 6 squarish or wavy; sub-type 5-b, with
medium groove, 1 straight, 26 concave and 1
squarish base; finally, sub-type 5-c, or typical
Folsom with long and broad groove, 4 straight, 31
concave and 13 with squarish or wavy base line.

and Folsom may best be presented in the form of

the three ordinary Yuma types or slightly better,
except for type 3, suggesting again their relationship
to them. As for the original Folsom points, once
more they reveal a difference of fineness. Their
flaking fluctuates between 4.5 and 15, with an
average of 8.87, well above all other classes,
although a few are somewhat roughly made, as
previously mentioned. They seem to represent a
final achievement in skill; in that they are really
comparable to the best Solutrean artifacts of
Western Europe.

Work done by archaeologists, geologists, and
paleontologists, at various sites of New Mexico,
Colorado and Nebraska, so far seems to indicate
an antiquity reliably estimated by several scientists
between 10 and 15,000 years, possibly more. Thus
these beautiful points are the oldest human artifacts
scientifically dated until now in America. They have
been discovered, as expected, in association with
other implements such as hunters of the late Old
Stone Age used elsewhere in the world: side
scrapers, end-scrapers, borers, knives, utilized
flakes, etc.

A STUDY OF INDIAN PICTURES IN TEXAS
BY FORREST KIRKLAND
Our North American Indian, like primitive man
in most other parts of the world, had a profound
interest in picture making. He decorated his pots,
his baskets, and his clothing with conventional
designs; he painted his body in stripes and figures
or decorated it with elaborate tattoos; he often
pictured his brave deeds on his buffalo robe or on
the walls of his tepee; and when rock walls or cliffs
were available, he often carved or painted on them
designs and figures common to his culture. Most
of these designs, except those on the rock walls
and cliffs, have perished with the material on which
they were painted; and, only rarely, a fortunate
archaeologist uncovers some specimen that has
escaped complete destruction. But many of the
shelter walls and overhanging cliffs, on which the
Indian painted his pictures, still stand, like great art
galleries, crowded with these dim and crumbling
designs—the last extensive examples of our
aboriginal art.

cliffs. This type of Indian art is, by far, the most
abundant in Texas, being found in large groups near
Paint Rock, Comstock, Langtry, Dryden, Fort
Davis, and El Paso; and in smaller groups, from
the Nueces River Valley to the West throughout
the Big Bend and the Davis Mountains, and north
to the Canadian River in the Panhandle.
Pictographs Are in Very
Bad State of Preservation

The thing that impressed us most when we saw
our first group of Indian pictures, the group at Paint
Rock, was their deplorable state of preservation.
Their location, on a stratified rock cliff above the
Concho River, is near an old ford of the river. A
campground: first, for the Indians; then, for the early
travelers and settlers; and since, for fishing and
picnicking parties. Thousands of curious people
have climbed up this cliff to look at the crude Indian
pictures and to leave their names painted, penciled
or carved on the rocks. We noticed one name dated

A Study of Indian Pictures in Texas
We have found the condition at
other sites just as bad, and in some
cases, even worse. Groups like Paint
Rock, near public picnic grounds,
have suffered most from the hand of
the white man. But the white man
has destroyed many less designs than
did the Indian himself. At almost
every location, there has been a great
deal of overpainting. One Indian
artist, apparently, had little respect
for the work of another. In the basket
maker shelters of Val Verde County,
this over-painting on the back wall
was continued generation after
generation, until all that remains now
in some shelters, is a confusion of
color from which, only now and
then, a fragmentary design or figure
can be distinguished. There are
hundreds of feet of wall space in
these shelters on which the pictures
are destroyed. And this destruction
is always worse in shelters where the
midden deposit has accumulated in
very large quantities. Evidently, the
first designs were painted at a
convenient level, about five feet
above the original floor. As time
went by, the pictures were overpainted again and again; and the
accumulating refuse in the floor
raised its level until, at length, the
pictures were at the very feet of the
occupants; thus they were scuffed
and scarred until they were
completely destroyed. Basket maker
shelters have been found in which
the pictures were almost completely
covered by the midden deposit.
Fortunately, in a number of shelters,
the pictures have been protected by
a shelf, or hump of rock at the base
of the back wall; from these shelters
we have secured our best examples
of this art.

shelter in the bank of the Rio Grande just below One Mile
Canyon.

48

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

At Meyers Springs near Dryden
and at a few other locations we have
found very good evidence that
certain designs were deliberately
smeared or otherwise mutilated by
the Indians themselves.
Fires and smoke have done much
damage to pictures at many
locations. In the Davis Mountains,
the pictures were often painted very
low on the sloping backs of small
shelters used chiefly as fire places.
These pictures, usually painted in
black, and very difficult to find, have
been badly damaged by the fire, and
can only be seen clearly when wet.
Most designs on the ceilings of
shelters have suffered to some degree
from the accumulation of soot.
The hand of man, however, is by
no means the only enemy of Indian
pictures. At Langs Mill near
Fredericksburg we found a large
group badly damaged by a gray
lichen which is gradually covering the
damp walls of the shelter. A similar
lichen is growing over the paintings
in one of the shelters in the Seminole

the people who visit the sites will show the respect
due such examples of art and refrain from the use
of pencils, paints, rifles, and chisels. The chalking
or oiling of pictographs for photographic purposes,
even by scientists, should be discouraged. This
practice does irreparable damage to the pictures
and is quite unnecessary. We have found that an
application of clean water is the most effective
method of temporarily restoring very dim pictures
to their original strength.
How We Became Interested in Indian Pictures
My wife and I became interested in Indian
paintings after a visit to Paint Rock in 1933.
Realizing that in a few years these pictures would
probably be gone forever, we decided that
something should be done at once to save them for
the future. And it was only natural, since both of us
are professional artists, that we should think first
of making accurate copies to be filed away in a
safe place for future study. To make correct copies,
even of this one group, would take time. And we
were told that there were many other groups. Our
spare time consisted, chiefly, of our summer
vacation, but we were definitely interested; so in
1934, we returned to Paint Rock, and as an
experiment, made scale copies of every design and
picture on the cliff. This work proved so successful
and met with such favorable comment from both
artists and archaeologists that we have adopted
Indian pictures as our pet hobby, and have devoted
all of our spare time since to copying and studying
the pictures at other well known locations.

49

we hope that this and subsequent papers will prove
the value of such an undertaking, it may be well to
give some attention to our methods for the benefit
of other artists or archaeologists, who may wish to
undertake similar work in other sections.
The Advantages of Scale Drawings
Over Other Methods of Copying
Tracing, photographing, and making scale
drawings, are the three methods generally employed
to get copies of Indian pictures. The chief advantage
of tracing is that this method can be used by any
one not skilled in making drawings. The difficulties
encountered, however, in obtaining tracings of very
large designs, and designs high above the floor; and
the very bulky copies that result, make the method
unsatisfactory for use on a large scale.
Photography is the method most commonly
used. First, because it requires so little time and
can be done by almost any one who has a suitable
camera; second, because photographs are generally,
but without sufficient reason, accepted as the most
accurate copies possible. There are, however,
several very serious drawbacks to this method:
1. Many designs clearly visible to the eye are
entirely too dim to photograph successfully.
2. The imperfections of the background and
over-painted names, etc., show up so clearly on
the photograph that the Indian designs are difficult
to determine.

3. Many pictographs are painted in positions that
make it almost impossible to focus a camera on

fortunate enough to have the professional skill, and
because this method, when properly used,
overcomes almost every objection
raised to tracing and to
photography. Every design that can
be clearly seen and reached for
measurement can be accurately
copied to scale, and designs too
high to be measured can be drawn
freehand almost as accurately as a
photograph. Every design can be
shown in the same scale without
distortion and without a distracting
background. The copies are small
and of uniform size. And, what is
more important in the case of
pictographs, every design can be
shown in its correct colors.
Materials Used For Making
Copies
Water color was chosen as a
medium because water color board
is most suitable for careful pencil
drawings, the color can be quickly
and accurately matched and
applied over the pencil sketch, and
will dry immediately. Since the
copies are intended to be filed away
as a permanent record, only the
best standard materials are used.
Our colors are chosen from an
absolutely permanent palette of a
reliable make, and our paper is
hand made English linen mounted
on six-ply board. All copies are
made on uniform size cards, eleven
by fifteen inches, which is onefourth of a standard water color
board. This size is ideal for
handling and storage, and has
proved a very convenient shape for
copies at most locations. When the

or three designs which are in yellow. They are associated with

A Study of Indian Pictures in Texas
Choosing the Scale For the Copies
The size and type of the pictures at a location
determine the scale. For the sake of easy
comparison, however, we try as often as possible
to use the same scale on all pictures at one place.
Very large pictures can, of course, be reduced
successfully to a much smaller scale than very small
or complicated designs. One-half inch to one foot
is the usual scale for large designs, although one
and one-half inches to one foot is best for groups
or small pictures. When the pictures are continuous,
or almost so, on a long wall, a scale is chosen that
will fit the group to a series of boards or plates, as
we call them, so that no important design will be
divided, and so the group can be reconstructed in
its true relations by placing the plates end to end.
(Plate 15). To do this requires considerable
measuring and planning before the copies are begun,
but the plan has worked out remarkably well at
every site where the pictures were continuous. If a
blank space is on such a wall, a break is shown in
the copy and the distance omitted is noted on the
plate. If for any reason, a picture has to be moved
from its correct position, a note is always attached
explaining the alteration. Where the designs are
scattered about over the wall or cliff so that the
above procedure is impractical, they are copied or
numbered as nearly as possible in their order from
left to right. (Plates 17 and 18).
Procedure of Making Copies At A Location
Our actual procedure at a location is as follows:
1. A careful survey of the location is made to
determine the number and type of designs to be
copied.
2. The walls are measured, the scale chosen, and
the designs to go on each plate determined.
3. The section allotted to the first plate is divided
in convenient spaces, usually three or four feet,
depending on the scale, and marked with upright
sticks. (We avoid chalking the wall if possible).
This greatly simplifies the work of copying.

51

the skill of the artist and the care with which he
performs this operation.
5. When every design on the first section has
been copied in pencil, the general tone of the
background is painted in. No attempt is made to
show small imperfections in the rock or slight
variations of color, which would only confuse the
Indian designs.
6. Seated in front of each design, we recheck its
copy for accuracy, match its color, and paint it in
on the plate. For the sake of legibility, it is necessary,
in most cases, to use stronger color than is now
found on the paintings. As a rule, we try to make
our copies about the strength of the original paint.
Slight breaks in lines and figures from flaking or
other injuries are disregarded in the copy, but no
part of a picture is ever added that we cannot be
positively certain about.
7. The above procedure is continued with each
section until the entire group is copied. Then, a
careful survey is made of the location for artifacts,
mortars, burnt rock hearths, and other cultural
indications.
8. Photographs are made of the shelter or cliff
and of any other objects of interest at the location.
9. Notes are made of the location and of every
interesting thing observed during our survey of the
grounds. The kind of rock on •which the designs
are painted, the condition of the designs, the colors
used, the over-lapping of designs, and any other
unusual feature of the paintings, are carefully
recorded in these notes. A condensed draft of these
notes and the photographs made at the location are
later attached to the back of the copies. The original
notes are filed away as a permanent record of the
survey.

In the beginning we were interested chiefly in
the artistic merit of Indian pictures, and although
we felt that our copies might be an aid in the study
of Texas Archaeology, we had little knowledge of
the subject and no thought of qualifying for the
work. However, after our first field trip, we decided

we began collecting and studying all available
material on the subject. From this study and from
the ever increasing knowledge gained from the field
trips, we have developed a keen interest in the
scientific aspect of Indian pictures, and have come
to believe that much light can be thrown on Texas
archaeology by their study.

There are three general approaches to the study
of Indian pictures: First, a study of the color with
which pictographs are painted or the type of carving
used on petroglyphs; second, a comparative study
of the designs used at different sites; and third, a
correlation of the artifacts and other cultural
evidence with the pictures at each location. Study
along these lines should throw light on the material
culture of the Indian, his artistic taste,
and his ceremonial and religious
practices; it should indicate the
general distribution of cultures; and
should furnish a means of determining
their approximate age. Although our
survey is yet far from complete, the
following brief discussion of what we
have learned should give some idea
of the information we may expect
from a complete systematic study:
The Color Used On Indian
Paintings
The study of Indian color has been
an interesting part of our survey. The
material from which the color was
made is about the same at all
locations. Reds, browns, orange, and
yellows were all made from oxide of
iron, found in abundance in most parts
of The State, in the form of soft lumps
or concretions. Pieces of this color,
showing signs of use, are often found
in dry shelters. Black was made from
charcoal or some other form of
carbon, and white from clay or chalk.
Some of the smaller designs at
most locations were drawn with the
sharp edge of a piece of dry color,
but the great majority of the paintings
were made with liquid paint, with the
aid of some kind of brush.

horses at the bottom of Figure 1 and the devil at the left
of Figure 2.

This paint was prepared by
grinding the color in small mortars
and mixing it with some kind of liquid
binder. Mortars and grinding stones
have been found, still stained with the

color. Little is known, however, about the binder.
It, evidently, varied somewhat, with different
mixtures of paint, which explains why certain
designs have flaked off much worse than others on
the same surface. On one shelter in the Seminole
Canyon, we found three, large, human figures in
light yellow, where every other figure was red. On
close examination, it developed that these pictures,
originally, had been red, also, but the
color had almost entirely flaked off
leaving a yellow stain on the chalk
rock. This stain, no doubt, was due
to oil in the binder which had soaked
into the porous sur face. Lumps of
prepared color have been found (as
before stated), but, as far as I know,
no brush, still containing color, has
yet come to light.

Of all the six or more colors used, purple-red is,
by far the most common; then comes bright red,
black, orange, yellow, and white in the order named.
We have never found blue or green pigment,
although it has been reported at certain locations
within the state. Red, in its various shades, appears
to be the most durable color. White is seldom very
clear and black is always very dim. The carbon,

Meyers Springs, the pictures are on
a wall that faces west and receives
the full force of the afternoon sun
from about the middle of the
afternoon until sundown, and are so
near the water level of the stream that
runs under the shelter, that the lower
designs are submerged with its every
rise; yet many of the pictures are as
bright as if they had just recently been
painted. We know, however, that
many of the pictures in this group are
comparatively recent, because of the
evidence there of white influence.
The paint in all basket maker
shelters is very dim. This is due, more
to an accumulation of dust through
the ages, than to the fading of the
color. This is indicated by the way
the color is restored when the surface
is wet. Designs on chalky walls often
appear dim because much of the
color has fallen away in very fine
flakes, giving the designs the
appearance of crayon drawings.

from which black was made, has not stood very
successfully the test of time.
Although three or more colors are found at
practically every location, they are, as a rule, used
separately on different designs, and only rarely
combined in one design. At Paint Rock, Meyers
Springs, Rock Pile Ranch, and at many of the basket
maker shelters, however, we have found exceptions
to this practice. Many of the geometrical designs
at Paint Rock are executed in two or three well
chosen colors; two colors are combined in many
pictures at Meyers Springs; and two very large
intricate designs, at Rock Pile Ranch in the Davis
Mountains, are done in four colors—red, yellow,
black, and white.

We naturally wondered if these distinctly

difference in ability or taste of the individual artist
or from fundamental cultural differences. And,
although certain experienced archaeologists
contended that the difference was due to the
individual artist, we felt that it was too profound in
many cases to be the result of anything short of
cultural differences. If this were true, our problem
was to devise some means of isolating the designs
that belonged to only one culture. The first large

for that same reason, these shelters were seldom if
ever occupied by later Indians; so their art is usually
unmixed and can instantly be recognized by any
one familiar with their designs. (Compare Plates

Our next discovery along this line was a very
large shelter in the Seminole Canyon just above the
large basket maker shelter explored and reported
by the University of Texas in 1933. Here, we found
scores of figures, animals, and designs totally

figure groups and designs are
repeated at different locations,
indicates a very well developed
mythology in the culture. This is,
by far, the finest type of work we
have studied, and certainly deserves
a more detailed report when the
survey in that district is finished.
Type Stations in the Study of
Indian Pictures
Finding locations at which only
the basket makers had lived and
painted, gave us hope of finding
other locations at which only one
culture had left its art. If other such
locations could be found, they
might be designated as type stations
to serve as a basis for the study of
their particular culture. And here,
we suggest the Rattle Snake
Canyon shelter (Plate 15), eight
miles west of Langtry, as the type
station for the basket makers, until
a better location is found.

PLATE 19
Here are shown three sections from the Meyers Springs
group, 18 miles northeast of Dryden, Texas. Each section
represents a length of 18 feet. The group is continuous on

56

different from those of the basket maker; very
obviously, the work of one single culture (Plate 16).
And, what was more interesting, the figures
correspond exactly with a certain type which we
had already observed at both Paint Rock and
Meyers Springs. The floor of the shelter is level
with the bottom of the canyon and is flooded with
every rain, which, no doubt, explains why it was
never occupied by the basket makers, who occupied
four other shelters near by. There were many
mortars under and near the shelter, and on the bank
immediately in front was a large burnt rock mound.
The Indians responsible for the paintings at this
location, evidently, had lived on the bank in the open
and cooked on a community hearth. This
corresponded exactly with the location at Meyers
Springs—the flooded shelter, the mortars and the
burnt rock mound—so, it was no surprise that many
of the designs at Meyers Springs were of this
particular type. Tentatively, we have designated this
location, type station for the burnt rock mound
culture.

Another method of studying Indian designs, for
which we have had little time as yet, has been made
possible by our scale copies. With these copies, it
is a simple matter to transfer each design at a
location to small individual cards, which can be
grouped or shifted according to any desired
classification, and percentages and other figures
arrived at that would be difficult or even impossible
from any other method of study. These cards can
also be used in making comparisons of designs at
different locations and, perhaps, in many other ways
that may be suggested when such study is
undertaken.
Indian Handprints

One kind of a design found at many locations in
Texas and sufficiently interesting to warrant special
study, is Indian handprints. Handprints are of two
kinds: Positive prints, made by dipping the hand in
color and stamping it on the wall; and negative
prints, resulting from placing the hand on the rock
and spraying color around it. Red was the color

57

Pictures As A Means of
Determining Age
The question of age is one of
great interest, and one on which the
archaeologist is constantly striving
to throw more light. The study of
Indian art offers several means by
which the age of pictures, and
through them, the age of cultures,
may be approximated. Any picture
showing white influence such as the
horse, the gun or the church, must,
necessarily, be placed in historic
time. Many locations contain such
pictures, but that does not mean that
every picture at the location is,
necessarily, recent. A total absence,
however, of white influence at an
extensive group may be accepted as
strong evidence that the pictures
date back to a time before the
coming of the white man. Very dim
and badly weathered color,
especially on a firm rock surface, is
always an indication of extreme age.
From this sign alone, the basket
maker culture would rank among
the oldest in the state. This evidence
is strengthened by the accumulation
of many feet of midden deposits in
many of their shelters, until, in some
cases, the pictures themselves have
actually been covered. An
indisputable discovery of pictures of
extinct animals, like the pictures
found in Europe, would be hailed
as positive evidence of great age,
but no such pictures have yet been
found. It may be of interest,
however, to note that although
bows and arrows are found at most
other locations, they are totally
absent in the 10 basket maker
shelters where we have made
copies.
One method of studying age
which we may find very helpful in

belonging to each culture, can be determined
through the study of type stations, then the

Further Remarks on the PreColumbian Relationships

59

FURTHER REMARKS ON THE PRECOLUMBIAN RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO*
BY J. ALDEN MASON
It is generally believed that most of the higher
elements of North American aboriginal culture
originated in Mexico and spread from there to the
less highly civilized peripheral regions. North of
Mexico the areas of highest development were the
Pueblo region of our Southwest, and the Mound
region of the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast.
The cultural relations between these two regions
and between each of them and Mexico is one of
the most important problems of American
archaeology and one upon which much superficial
theorizing has been done, generally a generation or
two ago, but very little sound rationalization to date.
It needs much more study, and the present paper is
an attempt to formulate some of the problems and
the present state of our knowledge.
The temporal element especially needs to be
carefully considered. It is generally accepted that
agriculture and pottery had their origins in Mexico,
yet the rise and spread of these cultural elements
took place at such a remote period that we do not
generally consider them under the heading of
“Mexican influences” any more than we consider
the Indian himself as an Asiatic, despite the fact
that his remote ancestors probably came from that
continent. At the time of white settlement corn
culture had spread to practically its maximum
possible natural limit of cultivation, and all the tribes
cultivating it had no traditions, except mythological
ones, concerning origin. Pottery had an area of
distribution practically equal but probably spread
at a later period since the earliest agricultural people
of the Southwest, the Basket-makers, apparently
were ignorant of the art of pottery-making. By
“Mexican influence” we mean influences of a later
period from the higher cultures. If, for instance,
we find in the United States corn culture of a
specifically Mexican type, such as is indicated by
the use of the metate, or pottery of specifically
Mexican types, then we may truly be entitled to
posit Mexican influences.

Of recent years we have become a little less
certain of influences from Mexico. The rather heavy
crude pottery of the Northern regions, of the
Algonkians and the Eskimo, may have had a
different center of distribution, possibly even an
Asiatic one. The ceremonial ball-courts, of which
several have been found in Arizona, need not be
ipso facto of more southern origin; they might
belong to an old common cultural background, or
it is not impossible that the influence ran in the
opposite direction.
In the Mississippi Valley, especially in the
prehistoric mounds, are found some resemblances
to later Mexican culture, which may possibly be
due to direct contact with or influences from
Mexico. Among these may be mentioned the custom
of making large mounds, somewhat resembling the
pyramids of Mexico, certain shapes of pottery
vessels, elements of design such as the horned or
feathered serpent and human figures found on shell
and copper gorgets, and some elements of social
and religious organization found among some of
the tribes, such as the Natchez, at the time of the
first European occupation. Yet between this region,
the Southwest Pueblos, and the nearest high
civilization of Mexico stretch hundreds of miles of
prairie or arid land or of desolate swamps, which
were populated at the time of discovery by peoples
of lower and different cultural status, with little or
no agriculture, pottery or weaving. How, then, was
Mexican influence, if such there was, spread?
Doubtless we must look to archaeological
investigations for the answer, and these have been
greatly neglected in these intervening regions.
Probably the first question requiring
determination is: Is there any proof of actual
relatively late Mexican influence in the Mound
region? Unfortunately practically all of those who
have written upon this topic, with the exception of
Mrs. Nuttall1 and Spinden2, have been specialists
upon the Mound region with little knowledge of

60

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

Mexican archaeology, and any unusual and
especially excellent object found has been
considered as resembling Mexican work, or as
showing Mexican influence, without due
consideration of the characteristics of the many
different Mexican areas, or of the temporal
elements. Many of the older writers, who regarded
the “Mound-Builders” as a separate and now extinct
higher culture, leaped at once to a conclusion of
direct Mexican migration, many of them considering
the Mound-Builders as Aztecs or Toltecs, some
even reversing the direction of migration. Now that
it is generally believed that the mounds were made
by the ancestors of the present or recent Indians of
that region, such close relationships are no longer
accepted, but Mexican influence is still generally
credited. Such influence could have occurred in one
of three ways: by a large scale migration; by
migration of a small group which might have
introduced a small number of definite elements; or
by an infiltration of cultural elements and ideas by
means of slow spread or diffusion from tribe to tribe
without any introduction of alien blood or language.
In comparing two cultures in order to appraise
the degree of diffusion of cultural elements between
them, it is essential to consider not only elements
that occur in common, but also the absence of
fundamental elements. The importance of such
absences must be appraised differently in accord
with the nature of the hypothetical method of
diffusion, or rather they will indicate the method.
Thus in a mass migration the most fundamental
elements of the autochthonous culture will remain
in the new area, the details changed. Resemblances
should be found in physical type, language folklore
and fundamentals of economic culture. Among the
most fundamental elements of Mexican culture are
the use of the metate and the toasting of corn cakes,
stone masonry, and loom weaving. None of these
is found in the Mound region. I think it would be
generally agreed that all these elements differ
radically in the Mexican and Mound regions, and
that therefore this hypothesis must be ruled out. In
cases of slow diffusion without migration, readily
adaptable elements might be spread, but it is obvious
that these elements would be found in the
intervening regions. In the hypothesis of a rapid

migration of a small group, close or exact
correspondences in minor details may be found, but
the major elements of culture would be unchanged,
and no such correspondence need exist in the
intervening areas.
The following elements of possible Mexican
origin in the southern Mississippi Valley, apart from
the older generalized elements such as agriculture
and pottery, have been suggested by Moorehead3:
truncated pyramids or temple mounds, monolithic
hatchets, seated human figures, sculptured idol
heads, plumed serpents as decorative or symbolic
design motives, vessels with tripod feet, certain
engraved shells, spool-shaped ear ornaments, and
long ceremonial swords chipped from flint.
These nine elements might be classified into three
groups as regards their natures: (1) the very
generalized trait of building truncated pyramids; (2)
the very specific comparison of the figures of the
plumed serpent and the human figures of the shell
and copper gorgets; (3) the other six.
The building of truncated pyramids is a very
fundamental element of lower Mississippi Valley
culture, and obviously on an ancient horizon. It
could hardly have been introduced by a small
immigrant group; it must either have been brought
by an early mass migration, accompanied by the
other fundamental elements of culture, or spread
by slow contact. In the latter case certainly, and in
the former case probably, similar structures would
be found in the region intervening between the
Mississippi Valley and Southern or Central Mexico;
apparently they do not. On the other hand, the
concept of an elevated substructure for a temple,
which must of necessity be truncated, is such a
natural one, and occurs in so many different places
in the world, that the possibility of independent
origin is very great, and more specific and detailed
points of resemblance with Mexican templepyramids must be advanced before any connection
can be considered as proved. It must also be
remembered that in the region where these are most
frequently found the land is low, frequently flooded,
and the mounds even today used as refuges in case
of flood. Even in this area probably the majority of
mounds are mortuary rather than domiciliary or

Further Remarks on the PreColumbian Relationships
ceremonial, which is never the case in Mexico; they
are uniformly made of earth instead of stone or
adobe as in Mexico, and, on the whole, the case
for independent origin is probably better than that
for diffusion.
Monolithic axes are unknown in the Mexican
and Maya regions, but are especially typical of
Caribbean Colombia and the Antilles. In the
southeastern United States the occurrence is rare
and sporadic. A good case may be made out for
Antillean connections, but independent origin is by
no means ruled out.
Long ceremonial swords chipped from flint are
also not typical of Mexico, nor of the Antilles either,
in which latter region chipped objects are almost
unknown. They should probably be regarded merely
as a high development of a characteristic art of the
Eastern United States.
Seated human figures and sculptured idol heads
are common in the higher Mexican cultures, but
here again the concepts are so general and
unspecific that I cannot consider them as proving
connections without more details in common or
proof of continuous distribution. Independent origin
is very plausible.
Vessels with tripod feet are very characteristic
of Mexico but far less characteristic of the Mound
region. In Mexico they are most commonly found
on flat dishes or bowls, in the Mound region on
narrow necked vessels. Spool-shaped ear ornaments
are found in both regions, but here again relatively
few types of ear ornaments are possible and the
spool type is found in many widely separated parts
of the world and was almost certainly evolved
independently several times.

certainly look superficially very Mexican-like, but
more than superficial resemblances must be found
before Mexican influence can be considered as
proved. Mrs. Nuttall has compared certain ones in
which Mexican elements seem to be most obvious,
mainly from Etowah, Georgia, with Mexican
figures, generally those from various codices, and
has published her comments upon these. She was
apparently furnished with photographs of all
Etowah art objects and searched for resemblances
in Mexican art. Considering the wealth of Mexican
material and Mrs. Nuttall’s unexcelled familiarity
with it, it is but natural that a number of
resemblances were found. Her best analogy is with
the Etowah gorgets showing a human figure with a
nose like an eagle’s beak, lines on the cheek which
may indicate the eagle’s mouth and tongue,
headdress with dots which might represent pearls,
fringed loincloth, and circular ear ornaments,
brandishing in one hand an object which might be a

decapitated heads with tears in their eyes. Between

Mr. Moorehead, with greater assurance, states
it as his theory that the contact was in very early
times, and that a group of Indians crossed from
Yucatan to Cuba, populated the Antilles, and then
crossed to Florida, from which group the Mound
Culture developed. Although this problem will later
be taken up in more detail it might possibly be
objected at this point that such an early migration
could not explain the Etowah gorgets, whose
detailed resemblances are with specifically Toltec
and Aztec art.
Dr. Spinden has studied the question more
deeply and reached more tenable conclusions which,
even though he has published his data only in brief
form, carry great weight though not absolute
conviction. The “Eagle Warriors” in his opinion
were a cult of the Toltecs who flourished at about
the beginning of the current millennium. They are
depicted in both regions as anthropomorphic eagles
bearing decapitated human heads. The plumed
serpent was one of their symbols. The far-flung
trade relations of the Toltecs carried this cult and
the art motives and symbols associated with it,
together with certain technique such as that of
engraving shell and copper gorgets, to the Mound
and Pueblo regions in the United States, to Peru to
the South. Probably the traders to the Mississippi
Valley bartered for native copper from the Great
Lakes region, those to the Southwest for turquoise.
The hypothesis seems very reasonable, but we
should await Dr. Spinden’s presentation of his
complete data and argument before considering it
as proved.
These detailed resemblances in art are in a class
apart from the other seven that we have considered
and are explicable on Spinden’s hypothesis of
trading bands. They are relatively on a late horizon
(Spinden apparently thinks about the thirteenth
century). The contacts could not have greatly
affected the relatively civilized peoples of the
Mound region, and could have had little if any effect
on the nomadic peoples of lower culture in the
intervening regions.

To summarize my opinion as regards these nine
elements which have been proposed as indicating
Mexican influence in the Mississippi Valley;
Monolithic axes and long ceremonial swords
chipped of flint I do not consider as typical of
Mexico, and therefore should be ruled out of
consideration. Seated human figures, sculptured
idol heads and truncated pyramids or temple
mounds seem to me so unspecific and general in
character that a hypothesis of independent origin
would seem more plausible than one of diffusion.
Pottery vessels with tripod feet and spool-shaped
ear-ornaments may also be of independent
development, but diffusion has here a better
argument than in the case of the other five. Only
certain of the art elements in shell and copper and
that of the plumed or horned serpent seem to carry
a presumption of Mexican origin.
The latter two elements apparently did not
appear in Mexico until the Toltec horizon and could
therefore not have been diffused until that time.
Pyramids and tripod vessels are found in the Archaic
Cultures of the Valley of Mexico, and seated human
figures, spool-shaped ear-ornaments and sculptured
human heads were also probably characteristic of
these and some of them probably also of the archaic
Maya Q-complex. These might therefore have been
diffused at an earlier period. If this were the case,
before the development of trade routes, these
elements should be found in the intervening regions.
Let us now consider the regions intervening
between the Mississippi Valley and Mexico to see
if possible migrations or diffusions may have left
traces of Mexican influences here.
There are three routes by which Mexican
influences could have reached the Mississippi
Valley: (1) from Yucatan via Cuba to Florida; (2)
from the Southwest Pueblo region, where certain
few Mexican influences are indubitable and
accepted; (3) directly from Mexico via the Texas
coast A table showing the occurrence of the nine
elements, which have been considered in these
regions might be suggestive; X denoting presence,

It is seen from the foregoing table that of the
nine elements proposed as indicating Mexican
influences, two of which are not characteristic of
Mexico, not one has been found in the typical Plains
region or on the Texas Coast; almost all are also
missing in the Pueblo region, the majority are absent
in the Antilles, and most not even found in Florida.
While the archaeology of the Texas Coast and the
Plains is but superficially known, and future
researches may reveal the presence of one or two
of these elements, yet it is practically certain that
almost all of the nine elements never existed in these
regions. It is difficult to see, therefore, how they
could have served as corridors for the transfer of
Mexican elements into the typical eastern mound
region, by means of mass migrations or slow
diffusion. The route via the Antilles and Florida has,
on these grounds, a little better case, but by no
means a good one.
As regards this route, Miss Gower5 concluded
that “So far there are no satisfactory indications of
Central American influence on the culture of the
Antilles.” That there are Antillean influences in the
southeastern states she accepts, regarding them as
“too great to be purely fortuitous,” and she
considers them as due to “a series of not extremely
intimate contacts occurring at intervals during a
long period of time,” together with the “existence
of a common primitive culture.” Mexican and
Antillean cultures are so unlike that Moorehead’s
hypothesis of a very early migration from Yucatan
to Cuba, thus populating the Antilles, cannot be
accepted. Neither is the slow diffusion theory

acceptable, since no objects of a nature resembling
Mexican have ever been found, to my knowledge,
in Cuba or the other islands. It is not impossible, of
course, that at the time of the conquest, or possibly
in the days of the late Maya Empire, a band may
have crossed from Yucatan to Cuba and thence to
Florida and Etowah, where they introduced the
supposedly Mexican art elements. However there
are no other indications of trade over this route
and I consider such a journey to Etowah by this
route as highly improbable.
The other two possible routes have been
discussed at more length in my former article in
this Bulletin. In the Arkansas mound region are
mounds, generally ascribed to the Caddoan peoples,
the pottery of which shows surprisingly close
connections with that of the archaic Q-culture of
Central America as pointed out by Vaillant.6
The influence that brought this must have been
more of the nature of a true migration than the
ephemeral trade relations that may have influenced
the culture of the eastern mounds, such as Etowah.
It was also presumably on a much earlier horizon.
Strangely, there are few evidences of such passage
in the areas between Arkansas and either the Pueblo
region or northeastern Mexico. In the former region
there appear to be none, but on the Gulf Coast there
are a few evidences, mainly in ceramics, that indicate
that the influence may have taken this route.
There are, then, the following possibilities of
influence from Mexico in the United States: an early

Excavation of Pueblo Grande de Nevada

65

EXCAVATION OF PUEBLO GRANDE DE NEVADA
BY M. R. HARRINGTON
Immediately after the completion of Boulder
Dam, the rising waters impounded by it, now called
Lake Mead, began to inundate the sites of camps,
villages, caves and rockshelters once occupied by
ancient man along the Colorado river and its
affluents in Nevada and Arizona. Two of these sites
were of real importance, one a late Basketmaker
village at the junction of the Virgin and the
Colorado; another, Puebloan in character, at the
mouth of the Walapai Wash.
The loss of the Basketmaker site is especially
unfortunate, because its ruined pit-dwellings
contained charred timbers, some of them pine drift
logs from the Colorado, by which the place might
have been dated by the tree-ring method. This date
once established it would have been possible to
figure approximate dates for other ancient
settlements in the vicinity; for instance the so-called
Lost City of Nevada which we know followed the
Late Basketmaker occupation. The “city” cannot
be dated by its own charred timbers for these are
always willow or some sort of mesquite which are
useless for the purpose.

incidentally in adjacent territory while the work of
rescue was going on.
Last but not least a trailside museum was erected
by the Park Service near the little town of Overton,
Nevada, to house the finds.
The “Lost City,” it may be remembered, was
discovered in 1924 by two brothers, John and Fay
Perkins, local residents, and reported by them to
Col. J. G. Scrugham, now Congressman, but at that
time Governor of Nevada. The writer visited it with
the Governor in the fall of the same year. It was
officially christened “Pueblo Grande de Nevada”
but some newspaper writer dubbed it the “Lost
City” and this name caught the popular fancy.

It turned out to be a group of ruins, more or less
covered by sand dunes, scattered along east of the
Muddy River between Overton and St. Thomas for
nearly six miles. The period, judging from the
pottery, was Early or Developmental Pueblo also
known to archaeologists as Pueblo II, which

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

When the Museum of the American Indian
closed its work in 1926 this house remained
unfinished, and its completion was one of the first
tasks attempted when excavation was resumed
under Park Service auspices in 1933, with the
writer, now Curator of the Southwest Museum,
again in charge. Although a large sand-dune had to
be removed to get down to the crumbling walls,
the force of about thirty CCC boys under two
experienced foremen made short work of
completing this task and turned then to other ruins
the excavation of which had not been hitherto
attempted. When the writer left the project in 1935
more than one hundred distinct houses had been
uncovered in the “Lost City” and a large number of
specimens unearthed, of which the Southwest
Museum received a representative collection.

Since 1935 the work has preceded with the
writer in the capacity of consultant, and at last
accounts was still continuing in a race with the
advancing waters, and the collections have been
greatly enriched, although with a smaller crew and
only one foreman in the Moapa Valley sector. The
museum was completed in 1935 and has already
been visited by thousands of tourists and students.
The material removed from the ruins consists,
for the most part, of pottery, usually broken of
course, but with plenty of whole vessels to give an
excellent idea of what the ancient people could
make along this line—bowls, graceful water jars,
canteens, cooking pots, occasional toys, and odd
pieces. The decoration is mostly confined to the
inside of bowls, although other vessels were
sometimes ornamented on the outside. The patterns
are geometric, frequently well planned
and executed, and are made with black
lines painted on a gray, white or
sometimes a lustrous red background,
and made permanent by firing.
Corrugated ware—that is, pottery
ornamented with parallel ridges,
sometimes modified by notching, is
very common, especially in the latter
houses of the “Lost City” and the
outlying settlements.

as the abalone and the olivella. The
bracelets, especially, came from the Gulf,
and must have been traded up the
Colorado river.
So much for the more or less
imperishable articles found every day in
the rooms of ruined buildings, in the ashdumps outside, or with human burials.
We also found a few things ordinarily
perishable in such places, due to charring
and other conditions especially favorable
to their preservation. Among the most
interesting of these were pieces of cotton
cloth, some of it surprisingly fine, found
with burials where graves had been
carefully covered with an impervious
layer of adobe clay. Most of these textiles
were plain white in color, but in some
cases, apparently for women’s dresses,
they were dyed a sort of purple.
There were also diagonally woven
bands, especially headbands worn by
men, that showed a square or diamond
shape interwoven pattern, usually in
black, as well as a fringe along one edge.
Men wore kilts or breechclouts of white
cotton cloth, supported by waist-cords
composed of many strands of soft cotton
string loosely twisted together.
Both sexes seem to have worn
blankets woven of strips of rabbit-skin
twisted around a yucca cord to make a
strong furry yarn, or of cotton, and
sandals woven of yucca fiber. One
infant’s grave yielded the entire yuccacord foundation of a little rabbit-skin
blanket.
Speaking of infants, we know that
these Pueblos used the cradle-board, not
alone from the flattening of the back of
many skulls, probably due to this cause,
but from the fact that a clay toy was
unearthed representing a baby tied on its
cradle-board, which was provided with

enough left of the arrows to see that
they were made of cane with
hardwood foreshafts to which the

another the wooden handle of a flint
knife remained and fortunately could
be saturated in dilute ambroid and
preserved.
In the dry caves and rockshelters
near the “Lost City” in deposits
known, from the pottery, to be of
Pueblo origin, a few other articles
appeared not found elsewhere.
Among these were a wooden spindle
with a whorl of unbaked clay and rags
of typical Pueblo feather blankets—
yucca strings wound with downy
feathers which had once been woven
in blanket form.

burned the roof and threw down the walls upon it.
Frequently personal belongings such as pottery,
implements and ornaments were deposited with the

popularity of corrugated ware.

71

EXPLORATION OF CERTAIN SITES
IN CULBERSON COUNTY, TEXAS
BY A. T. JACKSON
During October and November, 1934, the writer
headed an expedition sent by the Anthropology
Department of the University of Texas to explore
sites in the east-central and northeast parts of
Culberson County, Texas. The sites, consisting of
two sink-hole shelters, three other caves and a
burnt-rock ring-mound or midden circle, are located
from 32 to 49 miles northwest of the town of Toyah.
All were completely excavated.
The region has an elevation of about 3700 feet
above sea level, is semi-arid, sparsely settled and
devoted exclusively to the ranching industry. The
average annual rainfall is 17 inches. Scrubby
mesquite, greasewood, yucca and cacti abound in
places. Jack rabbits and quail are plentiful. The
rolling prairie and Culberson Plateau merge into
the Rustler Hills and Delaware Hills as one goes
northeast and west.
Types of Sites
Numerous caves are found in the low hills. Some
are real caves, with small openings that lead into
large chambers. Others are called “sink-hole
shelters,” due to the entrance being a large
depression or hole with parts of the wall
overhanging. Adjacent to the caves usually are a
few burnt-rock ring-mounds or surface middens.

Site No. 1 Caldwell Ranch
Work was started on Cave No. 1, Caldwell
Ranch. Since it is fairly representative of other sites
in the region, the work there will be described in
some detail. Only the outstanding features of other
sites will be mentioned.
Site No. 1 is of the sink-hole type, with an
opening 90 x 74 feet. The shelter proper begins at
the north end of the surface-hole and extends northnortheast for 110 feet. The floor has a gradual, but
fairly steep slope from front to rear. This resulted
in the low back portion, and a drain along the west
side of the shelter, made it damp and unsuited for
habitation. Likewise, the steepest part adjoining
the edge of the overhang was unoccupied. The
concentrated midden deposit, in the center of the
cave, covered an area about 50 x 35 feet. Some
one previously had dug a part of the deposit.
Four small midden mounds of the circular type
are located very near the cave. Inside the shelter,
worn into hard limestone, is a mortar hole. Four
others are in the flat-topped rocks outside the cave.
Three are circular and two “boat-shaped.” They
range in depth from 7 to 9 1-2 inches, and in
diameter from 6 to 7 inches.
Cross Section of Midden

Water Supply
The question of the water supply for the
aborigines is a perplexing one. Some of the large
sites, that show extensive occupation, are located
as much as two to six miles from permanent water.
For a few weeks after a heavy rain, pools of water
might have been sufficient for the requirements of
small bands. But it seems likely that during most of
the year water was secured by digging shallow pits
in some nearby valley. Ranchmen report that in
certain places water can be found by digging from
three to six feet in the sandy soil.

A cross section in this first cave was as follows:

sticks and twigs, some grass and midden material.
A few fish-tail sandals and wooden implements.

intermixed with a great number of small burnt rocks,
some limestone boulders (from roof) and much
gravel. Considerable charcoal; a few small animal
and bird bones. Several potsherds at depths ranging
from 10 to 28 inches. An occasional fragment of
charred matting.

It thus will be seen that evidence

depth of 99 inches.
So-Called Storage Pit
In the course of the excavation
there was found what appeared to
be a trash pit or abandoned storage
pit. Its upper part was 33 x 20,
increasing to 42 x 28 inches at a
depth of 65 inches. Beneath a
quantity of grass and twigs there
was a well-arranged layer of large
fragments of matting and basketry.
The edges of the pieces overlapped
and the whole had a concave
surface 20 x 15 inches.
Under the matting, and
extending 13 inches further west,

BASKET AND POUCH CONTAINING MESQUITE BEANS
1. Basket found in an inverted position at a depth of 22 to 28
inches in cave deposit at Site No. 1 C. M. Caldwell Ranch,
Culberson County. The basket is 6 inches tall and 14 ½ inches
in diameter. One side is decayed, due to location at edge of a
small drain coming from the mouth of the sink-hole. Inside
the basket is a pouch made from coils of grass stems and
leaves twined together with small fiber cords spaced one inch
apart. In the pouch were hundreds of mesquite bean seeds.
Pods apparently had been devoured by insects.
2. Bottom of basket, showing reinforcing stitches of yucca

was a 4-inch layer of grass and small brush. Next
below was a layer of ash 2 to 5 inches deep; then a
17-inch thickness of matted grass and twigs, with
pieces of charcoal and a few rabbit bones. Bedrock
was found at a depth of 87 inches. Partly
surrounding the lower 20 inches of the pit were
four limestone slabs. It is possible that these may
have been the remains of a stone-lined cist.
Found in the pit were four fragments of matting
of diagonal weave, five of the over-two-under-two
technique; five pieces of basketry of split-stitch type;
a small piece of rabbit skin; a fiber cord 20 inches
long and 3-16 inch in diameter, with ends tied by a
square knot; and a section of reed shaft 9 inches
long and 5-16 inch in diameter. The unbroken end
had been trimmed then compressed by wrapping
with sinew; a second wrapping was 1 3-4 to 2 1-4
inches from the first. The fragments of matting
varied in size from 7 1-2 x 5 to 12 1-2 x 7 inches;
the basketry from 11 x 2 to 15 x 7 inches.
Yucca-Leaf Spliced Rope
From a depth of 94 inches came a “rope” made
by tying together 13 strips of split leaves of Spanish
dagger (Yucca treculeana). The strips, about 1-4
inch wide, were united with 9 square, 2 granny and
one double-granny knots. The length of the rope is
8 feet 10 inches. It was found doubled up in a
bundle, with a quantity of grass and twigs beneath.
Cache in Basket
At a depth of 22 inches was an almost complete
basket. Six inches tall and 14 1-2 inches in diameter,
it was in an inverted position with the rim 28 inches
deep. The basket was surrounded by small burnt
stones and black ash. One side, next to a drain, was
rotted away, while the remainder was dry and well
preserved. Of split-stitch technique, the basket has
walls 5-16 inch thick. The bottom is reinforced or
repaired with a row of yucca-leaf stitches.

and leaves twined together with small fiber cords
spaced one inch apart. The Ethnobotanical
Laboratory1 at Ann Arbor reports that “The grass
is of the wiry bunch-grass type and has convolute
leaves. Although it may not all be of the same
species, identifiable parts of Pappophorum sp.
(probably Pappophorum vaginatum) were found.”
In the storage pouch, intermixed with ashes and
numerous small lumps of charcoal, were hundreds
of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) bean seeds. Near
the center of the deposit of beans was a heap of
reddish powdered material. This may have been the
remains of the bean pods devoured by insects.
Not far from the basket, at a depth of 19 inches,
was about a pint of mesquite bean seeds in a heap.
They were in no kind of a receptacle.
Possible Net Snare
At a depth of 30 inches was part of what appears
to have been a snare for birds or small animals. It is
made of very small fiber cord, knotted into 2 1-4inch mesh. The present size of the net proper is 11
x 7 inches; an end-cord or loop adds another 5
inches to the length. The bottom of the end-cord
contains a small loop, into which the main cords of
the snare or net are attached by simple loop knots.
The end-cord may have served to attach the snare
to a bush or stake. This specimen is suggestive of a
net snare found by Nusbaum.2
Pottery
Most significant of the finds in Caldwell Cave
No. 1 was the pottery. No whole vessels, but 44
potsherds, were found. Eleven per cent came from
the surface; 55 per cent from the midden deposit at
depths of 10 to 36 inches; and 34 per cent from 60
to 88 inches. No sherds were found between 37
and 59 inches.

The question of the association of the pottery
with the various types of artifacts is an important

Fish-tail sandals were found with potsherds at
depths of 10, 14, 20, 26, 34 and 78 inches. One
sandal, at the latter depth, was in a bad state of
decay, undisturbed and with a potsherd at the same
depth and at a distance of 6 inches.
A basket bottom, at a depth of 49 inches, was
11 inches above a potsherd. The basket containing
mesquite beans was uncovered at a depth of 22
inches, and near by at the same level were potsherds.
Other basket fragments from depths of 12, 20 and
26 inches were with pottery. At a depth of 65 inches
were two basket fragments and a piece of matting
of the over-two-under-two diagonal weave; 26 feet
away and at depths of 78, 86 and 88 inches were
potsherds in an undisturbed deposit.
Rabbit-sticks, from 15 and 33 inch depths, were
in levels with and not far removed from pottery.
A reed shaft and wooden foreshaft from 19 inch
depth and the nock end of a reed shaft from 16
inches, were in levels at which pottery was found.

Santa Fe identified representative sherds from this
and nearby sites. From Caldwell Cave No. 1 were
Chupadero Black-on-white, Red-on-terracotta, El
Paso Polychrome, El Paso Brown and a probable
hybrid. Sherds, from depths indicated, were
described by him as follows:

No. 5. Depth 86 Inches: This is probably a
hybrid. The paste is of the El Paso sort, but the
thick red slip on the interior is derived from an, as
yet, unnamed ware, that ranges from Northern
Chihuahua to the Mimbres region where it is very
common.
No. 8. Depth 19 Inches: El Paso Polychrome;
somewhat reburned by use but typical. A fine
example of the best period of thin walled vessels.
With regard to sherds from the different depths
he stated: “I should say that all of these sherds,
from what data we have at present, and regardless
of depth, can be considered as contemporaneous
within, to be on the safe side, fifty to one hundred
years at the most.”
In discussing the Chupadero Black-on-white he
adds: “This particular type seems to have existed
over a much longer period than many other blackon-white sorts. We think that its range would be
from in the neighborhood of 1300 A. D., or perhaps
a little earlier, to circa 1600. * * * Inasmuch as
black-on-red occurs concurrently with the black and
white during a period up to about the middle of the
14th century, but probably not later, as it seems to
disappear about that time, although the black and
white appears to have lasted much longer.

The sandal frames, or warp
elements, are in most cases of
multiple strands. Particularly is
this true of ones made of the small
leaves. The frames form one
rounded end; but cross at the
opposite end, leaving a V-shaped
protrusion—thus giving rise to
the popular term “fish-tail sandal.”
The weaving technique seems to
be uniform, the weft strands
crossing near the center.
A number of the sandals are
reinforced by attaching pads of
fiber or yucca leaves on the
bottom side. Some of the pads are
more than 1-2 inch thick. They
may have been attached originally
or later when the bottom became
badly worn.
There are several variants of
the general sandal tie-string. In
each case there is a loop, of the
same material, at the rounded end;
a string attached to the frame at
each side near the center. The
strings are united by square knots.
In one case the two loops
interlock; again, a third loop
interlocks and joins these two.
Apparently no string was used
back of the heel, the ones found
being for use between the toes and
over the instep. Of the sandals
with tie-strings remaining, 27 per
cent each were of the two-looptwo-strand and two-loop-fourstrand; 18 per cent each of twoloop-three-strand and three-loopthree-strand; 10 per cent of them
were three-loop-one-strand. The
loop at the toe-end usually is a
continuation of the warp element,
tied by an overhand knot.
The sandals are comparatively
small, many appearing to have

Flint Work
Only 33 flint artifacts were found in the cave.
These included 22 scrapers, 5 projectile points, 3
so-called warclub spikes, 2 spokeshaves or
woodworking knives, and one awl.

77

A large very crude projectile point was found
an inch beneath a potsherd at a depth of 10 inches.
The other points were somewhat crude but of
medium and small size. One from the surface was a
broken microlith or so-called “bird point.”
This extreme scarcity of flint
artifacts is in striking contrast to the
situation in regions where there is
abundant local supply of flint.
Rabbit Sticks
Fewer rabbit sticks were found in
the first than in some of the other caves.
The specimens came from depths of
15 to 43 inches. Certain distinctive
features are: groups of finely carved
lines encircling the small rounded end
of the implement; three parallel
grooves or lines on each side, running
lengthwise. The width of the specimens
range from 9-16 to 2 1-2 and thickness
from 1-4 to 5-8 inch. None from the
first cave was complete, so that the
exact lengths could not be determined.
An interesting feature on two
specimens was the working down on
one edge, for about half the length, to
a sharp knife-like finish.

Scheele) flower stalk, 23 inches long
and one inch in diameter, had one pit
near the edge of the stick. There was a
groove beneath, to facilitate the spark
reaching the tinder. The specimen was
found at a depth of 94 inches. It is
interesting to note that fire-hearth
sticks from many of the caves in Val
Verde County do not have a groove or
side opening to the drill pit.
The fire drill seems to have been a

Other Wooden Artifacts
A wooden foreshaft, from a depth
of 49 inches, was 7 1-8 inches long
and had a sharpened point.
The nock end of a wooden shaft
came from 34 inches in the camp
refuse between boulders at the rear
of the cave. The shaft was 9 1-4
inches long with a diameter varying
from 3-8 to 1-2 inch. The notch, in
the small end, was very shallow.
Subsequent to its use as a shaft, the
specimen was severed by hacking
and breaking. It is of hardwood and
in good condition.
Articles of Reed
The nock end of a reed shaft was
against the southeast wall and 16
inches deep. Wrapped at three
places, the shaft had a length of 6 916 inches, diameter of 5-16 and
notch 3-16 inch deep. Various other
fragments of reed shafts were found.

twined with fiber cords. A number of loose cords
on top of some of the bones suggested that
originally the body may have been covered with
the grass mat.
The second burial was between boulders at a
depth of 12 inches. There was grass above and
beneath the burial. All that remained of the skeleton
were two ribs, a few vertebrae and the skull—minus
the lower jaw. The skull was that of a child of
perhaps two years.
The skull was on the concave part of a mat that
measured 16 x 13 inches. The mat, badly gnawed
by rats, was made of fiber coils 1-4 inch in diameter;
twined with rows of fiber cord spaced 3-4 inch
apart. There were no offerings other than the mat.

Burials, Caldwell Cave No. 2
Two burials were found at this site. The first, at
a depth of 18 inches, was on a fiber mat or blanket
that measured 36 x 15 inches. The upper surface of
the mat was slightly concave. At the south end was
a round depression, as if made by the skull; but the
latter was missing—as were most of the other
bones. Remaining were four ribs, a femur, several
toe and finger bones, radius, ulna and humerus. It
seems that the skeleton may have been placed with
the head to the south and feet to the north. The
length of the femur was 16 1-2 inches. The length
of the mat suggests a flexed burial. Apparently rats
gnawed and scattered the bones.
The bottom mat was made of coils of fibrous
material about one inch in diameter and twined with
rows of fiber cords spaced some 2 1-2 inches apart.

Ring-Mound Group, Caldwell Site No. 3
This site consists of a group of ten burnt-rock
ring-mounds—sometimes called “mescal pits.” The
place is located in a draw, at the edge of a lowland,
where water was available for several months in
the year. The draw extends in a northwest-southeast

Of more than 50 middens of this

the amateur “dig” larger than 3 x 2

the fact that these middens yield few
artifacts. That fact probably gave
rise to the belief that they were not

made the following statement about
such ring-mounds:
“* * * Often the mounds in those
parts are perfect circles with
circular depressions in the middle.
Sometimes they are elliptical with
a trench-like depression. This
suggests very strongly that the
stones and earth of the kitchen

accumulation, to make earthlodges. * * *

“* * * It was definitely determined that they were
not pits, in any sense of the word; nor were they
concerned especially with the preparation of mescal
for food. Instead, they were found to be specialized
refuse heaps. These circular mounds contained, in
addition to the more obvious small cracked rocks,
accumulations of ash, charcoal, food bones and
other camp debris. As the term ‘mescal pit’ is
obviously a misnomer, and as it is likely to be
perpetuated by usage, the writer feels that a
designation more in keeping with the character of
the structures should be chosen. Therefore, the
name ‘midden circle’ is proposed.” * * *
In order to secure additional first-hand
information our crew excavated the largest mound
of the above described group. Work was started
on the east, or lowest, side near the draw and the
mound completely excavated. It was found that the
maximum depth in the outer ring of burnt rocks
was 33 inches; while that in the ashy deposit of the
central depression was 19 inches. The bottom of
the ash deposit in the center was on a level with the
bottom of the burnt-rock ring and the surface of
the surrounding land. Apparently no pit was dug.
Finds in Midden Circle
Of a total of 77 complete artifacts from this site,
only 21 were dug up; the others were from the
surface of the entire group. Of 74 potsherds from
the site, 48 came from the large mound; nine from
the surface and 39 were excavated. The artifacts
found in the midden were as follows:

Flint side scrapers ----------------------------------- 6
Flint fist axes, crude -------------------------------- 4
Flint bone crushers ---------------------------------- 4
Flint knife, small ------------------------------------ 1

21
The flint artifacts were uniformly crude. The
projectile point was found at 10 and the knife at 8

inches in depth. The bone pendant, at a depth of 8
inches, was in the burnt stones near the east edge
of the “ring.” The specimen measured 1 1-4 x 7-16
x 1-8 inch, the edges were rounded, and a small
hole was drilled at one end.
Of the 39 potsherds dug from the midden, 21
were black-on-white, and were found in the upper
seven inches. Mera identified sherds from the
midden circle as follows:

Other Burials
In the east end of the cave, eight
feet from the wall, was a grave
partly disturbed by rats. The depth
to the top of the mat covering was
10 inches, and to the grave floor 20
inches. The length of the grave was
33 inches; direction, southeastnorthwest. The head was to the
northwest, with face to north. Some
hair remained in place on the skull;
the ears were found in a desiccated
condition. The lower limbs were
missing.
A grass mat, 51 x 40 inches, was
beneath the body and was folded
back as a covering. The mat was
made of bundles of grass twined
with rows of fiber cords spaced 3
to 4 inches apart. Another mat,
made of fiber coils and twined with
cords two inches apart, measured
24 x 18 inches and was immediately
beneath the skeleton. Rabbit skin
cords represented the remains of a
fur blanket that was in a bad state
of preservation. There was a small
polished mano but no other stone
artifacts in the grave.
The remaining burial was found
in a large crevice in the rock, in the
central section of the cave. Above
the topmost of the two skeletons
was a fill of stones and ashy soil to
a depth of 22 inches. The width of
the crevice was 28 inches and the
length 11 feet; with the burial
slightly south of its center.

boulder; the left knee at the east side of the crevice,
with the foot doubled back against the rock. The
left humerus was extended outward over one femur
of the skeleton beneath; the arm was flexed with
the left hand over some matting; the right arm was
bent beneath the stomach. The right side of the skull
was against the west wall. The femora were 17 1-2
inches long. The teeth were small and badly worn;

the rear molars of the lower jaw were missing—as
was the case in certain skulls reported from Val
Verde County16.
A digging stick protruded 15 inches from
beneath this skull. Another stick had one end near
the left ear. The top skeleton was above a yucca
leaf mat of two-over-two-under weave. Just
beneath the mat, under the left hand of the upper
skeleton, was a bundle of five sticks with a large
fiber cord net of 2-inch mesh wrapped
around them. Beneath the lower
skeleton was a mat made of coils of
fiber twined with cords. A little-used
mano was just above the skeletons.
The lower skeleton, that of a child,
was on the right side, with the head to
the northwest and the feet to the
southeast. The legs were semi-flexed,
with the left foot across the right ankle.
The body was bent with the front of
the skull against the west wall. The
right arm was bent with the hand
beneath the pelvis; the left hand was
south of the chin. The length of the
femora was 11 1-2 inches.
In the grave was a short piece of
yucca flower stalk decorated on one
side with paintings in black. Another
specimen from the grave was a
wooden foreshaft 8 1-2 inches long
and 1-4 inch in diameter.

Grooved Rabbit Sticks, Brooks Cave

The bottom of a basket was located beneath the
abdomen of the adult. Its diameter was 6 1-2 inches,
with a hole about 2 inches in diameter in its center.
Although the remainder of the basket was not
found, the pierced bottom suggests ceremonial
“killing.”

One of the most abundant and outstanding types
of artifacts in this cave was the grooved rabbit stick
or so-called throwing club. Forty-one specimens
of this type were found in the cave. Some of the
clubs were as much as 24 inches long; the average
width was 1 1-4 inches and the average thickness
3-8 inch.

Destruction by Fire

Twenty-eight per cent of the specimens had no
grooves; 48 per cent had three grooves; 20 per cent
four grooves; and 4 per cent two grooves. Five per
cent of the grooved clubs had the lines arranged in
five sets; 9 per cent in four sets; 13 per cent in three
sets; 17 per cent had two sets; while 56 per cent
had continuous or unbroken grooves.

In the east part of the cave much of the deposit
of fibrous materials, sticks, and other debris had
been destroyed by fire. In some places the loose,
feathery ash showed the trash deposit originally to
have been as much as five feet deep. In other
sections there seem to have been several fires, with

Types of Basketry, Brooks Cave
No whole basket was found in
this cave. One bottom, 5 1-2
inches in diameter and employing
the split-stitch, came from only
two inches deep. Another of the
same type was at 12 inches. This
bottom, 6 inches in diameter, had
been patched by use of fiber
cordage. A fragment using the
interlocking stitch was from 7
inches. Specimens sent to Setzler
were identified by him as follows:

belong to the type described as a

Fragment No. 183 is most unusual.
My analysis indicates a single rod

on the concave or inside of the
basket. An example of this type
will be found in ‘Preliminary

Bows and Arrows

One fragmentary and two
practically whole bows were found
in the Brooks cave. There also were
found one reed arrowshaft, with
wooden bunt point, and the distal end
of another; two wooden foreshafts;
one nock end of a wooden shaft; and
three probable wooden arrows.
At a depth of 6 inches was an end
section of what appears to be a bow.
It is 20 1-2 inches long and 1 1-2
inch in diameter. The undamaged end
bears a notch, the other end is burnt.
A curved bow-shaped stick, with
remains of red stripes around it at
close intervals, was found on the
surface in the central part of the cave.
Its length is 28 1-2 inches and
diameter 5-8 inch. The ends are
decayed.
One of the outstanding finds, at a
depth of 7 inches, was a reed shaft
30 inches long and 5-16 inch
diameter, with a wood bunt point 3
inches long, making a total length of
33 inches. The nock end has a notch
3-16 inch deep with two sets of
wrappings within 1 1-2 inches from
the end. A third set of sinew
wrappings, with remains of three
feathers, is 4 inches below the notch.
The bunt “stem” is in place in the
reed shaft and bound with wrappings
one inch wide. The stem itself is
wrapped near the bunt proper. The
wooden stem is 1 3-4 inch long to
where it merges into the enlarged
blunt point. The latter is 1 1-4 long
and 3-4 inch in diameter, rounded
and battered at the distal end.
At a depth of 9 inches was a

bunt point inserted in it. The reed
section is 8 3-4 inches long; the bunt,

MORE EVIDENCE CONCERNING ABILENE MAN
BY CYRUS N. RAY
The first two skeletons of the Abilene type of
dolichocephalic man were found by the writer on
the Brazos River near Albany, Texas, in January
1929. (1). These were buried in stone slab cists in
an old charcoal and burnt rock floor stratum which
lies between six and a half and seven feet below the
present soil surface. Later other ancient buried floor
levels were found by the writer fifty miles nearer to
Abilene, buried at depths of 6, 8 and 15 feet below
the soil surfaces, also on the Brazos River. These
were on the W. Myatt place, located twenty-two
miles northeast of Abilene. (2)
In January 1930 the Gibson site (Site 7), situated
seven miles south of Abilene, was discovered by
the writer where three distinct strata of charcoal,
flint chips and burnt hearth stones outcrop, one
above the other, in a vertical bank at depths of
twenty-four and a halt, twenty-seven, and thirty feet
below the present soil surface. (See plate 36, Nos.
1 and 2). In this bank the writer first found the
distinctive, thick, base flattened, leaf shaped type
of projectile point, (3) (later termed Abilene Points)
(4) embedded in place, in a stratum 24 ½ feet below
the present soil surface. Later a total of close to
fifty skeletons of the Abilene type have been
excavated by the writer (5) and (6), which has
proved that this is a distinct type of man, and that
the skeletal peculiarities were not monstrosities as
at first claimed by some, or again rare and isolated
family characteristics found in only a few skeletons
(7).
This longheaded skeletal type, buried in typical
stone slab cist buried mounds (8) has been found in
a region extending 175 miles from east to west,
and sixty miles from north to south, centering in
Abilene. The deeply buried camp floor sites have
been found in a similar area, centering in the same
region, on the different branches of the Colorado
River, and on both the Clear Fork, and the Salt
Fork of the Brazos River, but wider in the diameter
from north to south, it being one hundred and fifty

miles from deeply buried sites on the Salt Fork of
the Brazos, to others on the Colorado River which
have been inspected.
Buried campsites have been found by this writer
in Taylor, Jones, Callahan, Nolan, Mitchell,
Shackelford, Runnels, Haskell and Concho
Counties, and these sites doubtless exist over a
much wider area. The writer has had neither the
time nor the money with which to investigate the
space limits of inhabitation of this ancient long
headed Texas race. The territory is so large, and
the evidences of ancient inhabitation are so
abundant as to suggest that this area must have been
populated with a considerable number of inhabitants
in a period when most of America had few, if any.
In the center section, where the longheaded
burials have been found in greatest numbers, the
deeply buried ancient floor levels are also found to
be the most numerous, and are almost continuous
on every vertical eroded Brazos River bank for a
distance of six miles or more. In the center of this
Jones County area, on the Hollis Roberts place, is
a small hill which stands close above some of these
deeply buried ancient floor levels, and here in 1932
the writer excavated eighteen burials from four
buried mounds, each grave enclosed in a separate
stone slab lined cist (6) and (8). Of these seventeen
were flexed burials, and one a cremated infant
burial. However, the mound containing the
cremated infant bearing cist, also contained three
adults, and another infant, not cremated, buried in
flexed position in stone burial cists.
Two Extended Burials
About a half mile to the south of the low hill on
which the multiple cist mound burials (6) and (7),
referred to above, were found, rises a high flat
topped hill, on which the writer noted structures
which he believed were burials; these he did not
excavate for several years, in the hope that Texas
University would get time to assist in the work.

There is always considerable danger in leaving such
sites unopened over any considerable period,
because of the fact that the country is full of persons
hunting for mythical treasure pots, who frantically
dig into any structure which remotely suggests the
work of man, and deliberately destroy all of its
contents.

layer, and at a depth of about three and a half feet
below the surface, lay the bones of the arms and
legs of two skeletons, which were extended at full
length. The articular ends of the bones were
decayed, but while the bone shafts were quite
fragile, they were carefully dissected out in place.
The two bodies apparently were laid on their backs
with the arms and legs extended at full length. The
bodies and skulls of both were completely decayed,
and the space they had occupied was filled with
large hard masses of caliche. No artifacts were
found with the burials. Not all of the mound was
excavated, and it is possible that others may be in
the same structure. Pictures were made but on
account of weather conditions did not turn out well.

the primitive type, Abilene longheaded race,
previously described in the Bulletins. The skull has
all of the teeth. One L. L. second molar tooth, and
one upper wisdom tooth, were affected by dental
caries.
A Primitive Tooth Type
The teeth are unusually massive and have some
quite peculiar distinctions. In fossil apes, the three
molar teeth decline in size from the third molar or
wisdom tooth, to the first molar, which is the
smallest. In some ape-like skulls dating very far back
in the time of man’s development this primitive
Dryopithecus tooth pattern still existed. In modern
man the reverse order exists. The third lower molars
on this skull are the largest human third molars
which the writer ever has seen (10).
In table II prepared by Gregory and Hellman in
The Dentition of Dryopithecus and The Origin of

95

Man it would seem that only the orang-utan and
the gorilla have antero-postero third molar
diameters greater than the left third molar of this
Abilene man skull. Apparently none of the
chimpanzee third molars listed were so large.
This extremely dolichocephalic skeleton has
molar teeth of very unusual size and shape. Their
longest diameters are from front to back. It was
difficult to measure the second and third molars on
account of the impaction of the third molars under
the edges of the second molar’s mushroomed
crowns. The diameters of L. L. M. 2 will have to
be estimated because of a large cavity in the
posterior end, which extends to the tooth’s center.
The following table of measurements were kindly
made with instruments of precision, by a gunsmith,
Mr. F. A. Davis of Abilene. See review concerning
Minnesota Man, in back pages of this Bulletin for
some other measurements of these teeth made by a
physicist.

Pictures of these teeth are shown on
Plate 38, Nos. 1 and 2. Both third molars
are larger than the other molars. These
teeth appear to be nearer to the
anthropoid pattern than any heretofore
excavated by the writer. It may be the
type of man who lived on the deepest
buried river bank levels below. (See Plate
36, No. 3, and Plate 37, Nos. 1, 2 and

½ inches. The breadth is 5 1/8 inches.
There is considerable facial prognathism,
as there is in all of these skulls.
No artifacts were found with the

and 3). Beneath the center of this was a small round
stone structure consisting of one horizontally laid
flat limestone surrounded by stone slabs set on edge.
(Plate 35, Nos. 1 and 2). About a foot beneath this
lay the closely flexed skeleton of a small adolescent.
(Plate 35, No. 3). The long bones had not completed
their growth and the epiphyseal ends were detached.
The bones of the body lay closely flexed beside the
skull in a very small space. The skull was in good
condition. This skull also belongs to the same old
extremely longheaded Abilene race which probably
inhabited this region thousands of years ago (11).
No artifacts were found with this burial. It was
buried four feet deep. The third molars were
showing but had not erupted in this skull; the other
teeth were well developed. The skull length is 6 7/
8 inches, and the width 4 13-16 inches.
All three of these burials had been placed, in
round holes, two of which were close to four feet
below the soil surface and just in the top layer of
the hard shale and caliche formation, and all showed
signs that caliche had formed adhering to the skulls,
and a considerable amount of caliche stone had
formed inside the skull of W. Myatt Flexed Burial
No. 3. One finger bone was also inside the skull.
These circular basins had been cut down several
inches into the caliche, in which the closely flexed
bodies had been placed. (See Plate 35, Nos. 1, 2
and 3). Then a small circular stone structure in two
graves, and a roof-shaped stone structure in one,
covered the burial basins. On top of this was a great
mass of heavy stones covering a large area in the
center of the grave. (See Plate 34, Nos. 2 and 3). A
third or top layer extended up barely to touch the
soil surface. The top and middle layers were buried
in the tan colored soil, which has in course of time
been deposited by wind action, on top of such high
flat topped hills.

97

blown tan colored soil, so that now only an inch or
so of the top three or four stones project above the
present level soil surface. It is not a reasonable idea
to the writer that primitive man would, with the
inadequate flint tools then available, have buried
such masses of stones three to four feet deep.
More Deeply Buried Middens
Until June, 1936, the writer had found only one
other site where the campsite debris was buried at
a depth approaching that at (Site 7 or Gibson Site)
and that was at (Site 6) situated 18 miles southwest
of Abilene where in 1929 he found a fossil horse
bone embedded in a bank at the same level with a
stratum of charcoal and flint chips and hearth debris
at 18 feet below the soil surface.
Recently another buried campsite was found in
an eroded nearly vertical river bank situated on a
stream bank 18 miles north of Abilene (Hodges
Site). Three superimposed campsite floor strata
lie exposed in a nearly vertical stream bank for a
distance of 200 yards or more. The highest is 8 feet
below the soil surface, the middle one is 14 feet
below the soil surface, and the bottom stratum lies
buried in clay 19 ½ feet below the soil surface. There
is an abundant outcrop of several species of mussel
shells in each of the charcoal strata. From the clay
in the 19 ½ or bottom level, the writer dug out a
mano or hand mill stone, which had been ground
down by use on both faces to a thin edge on one
side. At another place in the same level he dug out
an embedded paleolithic type flint axe. Flint flakes,
mussel shells, burnt hearth rocks, and charcoal were
more abundant in all of the three levels at this site
than any other. A number of the shells were removed
and taken to “The International Symposium on
Early Man” which met in Philadelphia at The
Academy of Natural Sciences in March, 1937. The
Secretary of The Academy, Edgar B. Howard, had
these shells identified and his report is as follows:

The writer suggests that the circular bottom layer
covering the caliche basins may have been the only
portion of the structure originally buried in the earth

This river bank site is located about a mile from
the top of the highest, nearest hill on top of which
were the graves previously described in this article,
and within two miles of this site a total of twentythree longheaded burials have been excavated from
nearby hill tops by the writer during and since 1932.
Of course there is yet no direct evidence to connect

these long heads with any buried campsite except
those usually found at depths of 7 and 8 feet (1)
and (9).
The circumstantial evidence, however, would
point to this type of man as the one who may have
occupied all of these ancient buried strata.
More Flints in Gibson Deepest Site
During 1937 more flints were found in the
Gibson deepest site than ever before. Many flint
flakes have been found embedded in place in the
deep charcoal strata each year since 1930, but these
have been mainly scattered in, or just below, the
hard gravel stratum at twenty-four and a half feet.
Recently ten flint flakes were seen to be projecting
from the charcoal stratum at thirty feet below the
top of the bank. On digging into this area a depth
of one foot, and a distance of 18 inches along the
stratum, a total of 274 thin, man-made flint flakes
were excavated, from a thin charcoal layer in the
red clay. (Plate 36, Nos. 1 and 2).

More Evidence Concerning Abilene Man

Flints Near Mammoth Bones
In the summer of 1934 the writer found two
thin flint flakes projecting from a stratum 18 inches
above the lower jaw and two teeth, ribs and portions
of leg bones of a mammoth on Lick Creek located
thirty miles southeast of Abilene. E. B. Sayles
secured some of these bones and later E. H. Sellards
secured part of them. Thus far six man-made flint
flakes have been found in the same stratum. (See
Plate 40, No. 1).
Oldest Terrace Hearth
In 1930 the writer found a highest terrace
thirteen miles south of Abilene in which a hearth
forty inches across projected five feet below the
top. This hearth was composed of a solid layer of
burned stones on top, underlaid by a thick layer of
charcoal. The hearth was so inaccessible that a long
ladder had to be used to reach it. This is the only
place where any large stones occur in the bank, the

99

rest of the bank seems to have been laid down in
rather sluggish back waters, since it is composed
of fine tan soil with horizontal lines of very small
pebbles ribboning through it occasionally. For flood
waters to top that bank now would first flood all of
the area below the mountains. So the five feet of
apparently water laid soil over the hearth must have
been put there before the valley eroded out to its
present depth. (See Plate 40, No. 2).
It would seem that the Abilene region would be
the logical place for those who seek evidences of
ancient man in America to look, instead of denying
that such evidence exists, as some do, and then
refusing to inspect the evidence. The evidence
certainly was here many millenniums before any of
those who say that it does not exist came on the
scene, and in the main will continue to be here after
they are gone, as after all there are few persons
able to dig far into banks nineteen and a half, twentyfour, twenty-seven and thirty feet deep; and those
who simply deny, without examination of the

At least one geologist (Antevs) believed these
sites to be of considerable geological age, and wrote
thus concerning them: “Surely old and significant
finds of artifacts and hearths have been made . . .
near Abilene, Texas, in river terraces that record
several distinct climatic and physiographic changes
in the region since the arrival of man.” In 1934 Mr.
Antevs visited the above described deeply buried
sites, discovered by this writer in 1929-30, in the
company of a man who, among several others,
assisted this writer in excavating several of his
discovery sites five years before.
This writer was not notified of the Antevs’
inspection of his sites until after it had been
completed. This was unfortunate in that Antevs
subsequently gave primary credit for the well
documented discoveries, which this writer has
made, to the wrong person in the article in the
publication quoted above and to which citation is
made (12).

Buried Middens in the Floodplain of the Little Wichita

BURIED MIDDENS IN THE FLOODPLAIN OF
THE LITTLE WICHITA RIVER
BY ADOLPH HENRY WITTE
The following report describes investigations
made by the writer in a portion of the floodplain of
the Little Wichita River that lies approximately
twenty miles from its mouth. In this area the
floodplain averages one mile in width, and the
stratified silts and gravels are known to be fifty feet
in thickness in certain stations. Necessarily, the data
presented shall be brief since no excavations have
been undertaken, and identifications of certain
paleontological specimens from the middens have
not been completed.
The writer and others have been collecting Indian
artifacts in the channel of the Little Wichita River
for a number of years. No special importance was
attached to these river-bed specimens as rather
similar artifacts could be picked up on nearly every
farm and ranch within this locality. It was merely
presumed that these articles had been lost by the
aborigines on the floodplain and old stream terraces,
and by erosion and flood had found their way into
the river’s channel. In 1930, Dr. Cyrus N. Ray of
Abilene, Texas, published an account of the deeply
buried middens discovered by him in Central Texas.
(Note 1). The possibility of there being similar
stratified hearths in this area was considered by the
writer, but several years passed before an actual
discovery was made.
Stratified Sites on The H. Body Estate
Site No. 1. A thick stratum of pleistocene gravel
is exposed in the bottom of the Little Wichita River’s
channel at this spot. Almost a complete artifact of
the type usually classified as Folsomoid, was found
here. Fragments of the teeth of an extinct horse
and one of the pleistocene elephants were found
when the writer recently examined this location.
Site No. 2. Faint midden exposure 8 feet below
the present surface of the Little Wichita floodplain.
Worked flakes were found in situ. Additional
artifacts found were a crude axe with sinuous edge,
several oval manos, similar to those in use up to

fairly recent times and a segment from the middle
of a large knife or spear. Many broken hearth stones
of local sandstone were observed.
Site No. 3. The midden horizon averages twelve
feet below the present surface of the floodplain and
contains a considerable amount of ash, charcoal and
shell. Hearth stones and a broken mano were
observed in situ. A few bones, apparently completely
mineralized, were noticed. These have not been
identified at this date. A leaf-shaped knife of local
quartzite was found in the channel here.
Site No. 4. The migration of the Little Wichita
River channel is eastward at this particular spot.
The bank is 20 feet high and almost perpendicular.
This site is exceptionally rich in finished artifacts
of stone. A battered quartzite hammerstone was first
observed in situ 15 feet below the surface of the
floodplain. Various types of artifacts are
represented. Part of the materials are not found
locally. The tools from this deeply stratified site
prove without question that tanged and barbed
weapons have been in use for a vast length of time
in this area. The few animal bones from this site
have not been identified. One bone, apparently the
ulna from a large bison, shows usage as a tool.
Burial Midden, Four Miles
Southwest of Henrietta, Texas
The migrating channel of the Little Wichita River
exposed this midden. The dark stratum of camp
rubbish averages four feet below the present surface
of the floodplain except in one small area recent
surface erosion has exposed the horizon. Chipped
and burned stones, ash and charcoal, are plentiful.
Only a sparse number of animal bones were
observed and these were mostly from the smaller
fauna. A small cache below the main stratum
contained a mass of small seeds, possibly from the
hackberry tree. During the early spring of this year
(1937), three local youths noticed that a human skull
had become exposed just below the midden stratum

104

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

and near the south edge of the deposit. The youths
hurriedly excavated the burial, but were
disappointed when no mortuary articles were found.
Several weeks later, two of the youths who had
excavated the burial, accompanied the writer to the
site. Since a few of the bones remained in situ, it
was possible to determine the original position of
the burial. The skeleton was closely flexed, lying
on the left side with the head toward the west, and
had been buried in a slight depression below the
level of the midden stratum. The fill around the
burial was the dark midden soil. An undisturbed
stratum of light colored silt, four feet in thickness
lay above the burial area. Two hundred feet down
the channel from Burial No. 1, a depression filled
with dark midden soil was observed. This proved
to be a second human burial. Only a few long bone
fragments and most of the pelvis were saved. The
skull from burial No. 1 was sent to Dr. Cyrus N.
Ray, for comparison with the ancient crania in his
collection from Central Texas. (See Editor’s note
**, also Plate (42) Nos. 1 and 2).
Several additional stratified sites containing
hearths and camp rubbish have been recently
discovered in this area. Two of these sites are
approximately twenty feet below the surface of the
floodplain.

Conclusion
It is obvious that man occupied certain areas in
the Little Wichita River floodplain during a
geological period when the surface of the plain was
at a much lower altitude. The evidence also shows
that climatic changes followed the initial
occupation, in some instances, many feet of
slackwater silts were deposited upon the midden
sites. Subsequent occupations of the floodplain
were followed by reoccurring excessive humid
conditions and additional strata of silts were
deposited upon the midden sites. It is usually
conceded that the climatic changes mentioned here
occurred a number of thousands of years ago in
the late pleistocene.

REVIEWS

Analysis of Indian Village Site Collections From
Louisiana and Mississippi, by James A. Ford,
School of Geology, Louisiana State University;
Anthropological Study No. 2, published by the
Department of Conservation, Louisiana Geological
Survey, New Orleans, Louisiana, November 1,
1936. It contains 285 pages which include besides
the text fifty illustrations and graphs, a glossary, an
index, and a bibliography.
The title of this treatise is somewhat misleading
as one might think that the book concerned every
type of archeological material obtained from a
campsite since its author does not state what kind
of artifacts or remains his collections consist of.
The book is devoted primarily to ceramics both
historic and prehistoric, and is a supplementary
study to Mr. Ford’s previous papers, Outline of
Louisiana and Mississippi Pottery Horizons and
Ceramic Decoration Sequence at an Old Village
Site Near Sicily Island, Louisiana.
The author after having made both intensive and
extensive studies of pottery throughout Louisiana
and Mississippi has divided the material into seven
decoration complexes: Choctaw, Caddo, Tunica,
and Natchez which of course have historic
affiliations; and the Deasonville, Coles Creek, and
Marksville which apparently were entirely
prehistoric in that area. He further subdivides these
types. For example, the Coles Creek complex
according to his studies consists of thirty-six
subdivisions.
Fortunately, Mr. Ford has not been content with
mere classification, but uses it as a means toward
an end: the establishment of a chronology for the
Lower Mississippi Valley. Herein lies the chief value
of his work, and distinguishes it from any previous
study made of aboriginal ceramics of this region.
Until Mr. Ford began his work the publications
which dealt with the ceramics of the Lower
Mississippi Valley had been primarily descriptive,
with apparently no aim in view other than to show

what had been excavated. Naturally, while that
attitude reigned sherds were of little importance,
for they do not often make good illustrations and
besides descriptions of sherds sometimes seem
ridiculously insignificant when potsherds are
considered separately.
By studying the horizontal and vertical
distribution of sherds with their varying types of
decoration, Mr. Ford has not only given the
archaeological work of Louisiana and Mississippi
a method, but he has also given the archaeologists
of the Lower Mississippi region an aim. Whether
future researches will confirm his conclusions (and
the reviewer believes that his major ones will stand)
or not, we must credit the Analysis of Indian Village
Site Collections from Louisiana and Mississippi
with being the first thoroughly scientific study of
ceramic complexes in the Mississippi delta. By not
contenting himself with descriptions the author has
shown an intellectual maturity which has not been
demonstrated by writers of the past who have dealt
with the archaeological remains in the same region.
Throughout his treatise Mr. Ford distinguishes
between the elements and the motif of decoration.
By referring to the glossary the reader can
understand what the author means by his use of
those terms, but it is evident, nevertheless, that Mr.
Ford has either created a terminology of his own
or else has a confused idea of what a motif is. This
terminology seems to be warranted neither by the
terms of designers nor by the definition of the words
in the Oxford and Webster dictionaries which define
a motif as “a salient feature or element of a
composition.” The reviewer believes that Mr. Ford
has used “motif” when he refers to the predominant
element of decoration and “element” when he
speaks of the subordinate ones. In the science of
archaeology where there is generally a confusion
of terms it seems advisable to avoid further
complication, especially where the subject is related
to another field such as design which already has a
standard terminology.

106

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

The chronologic value of motifs which is stressed
throughout this publication seems lessened when
one realizes that the range of motifs both in primitive
and modern art is decidedly limited. According to
the designer, Best-Maugard, there are only seven
motifs. A casual glance at the designs of ceramic
collections in any museum will show that these same
motifs have been used over and over again by
various peoples, and that it is not the motif which
is especially important in the differentiation of a
decoration group, but rather the way in which the
motifs are arranged to create a pattern, and the
adjustment of the latter to a vessel or other object.
Furthermore, rhythm, repetition, subordination, and
balance should be considered when a pattern is
studied, for they will constitute an integral part of
every decoration. Unfortunately, sherds are
frequently too small to show more than a part of a
decoration, and the research worker has to content
himself with the study of one or more isolated
motifs, and is unable to get a proper conception of
the rhythm, balance and repetition of the entire
decoration. If, for example, oppositional balance
should have been employed in the arrangement of
motifs, as was done on several vessels of pre-Caddo
ware from the Crenshaw Site, Arkansas, and the
researcher found unrelated in the field a potsherd
from different sides of the same vessel, he might
easily drink he had specimens of several types of
decoration. It is possible that Mr. Ford, because of
having to confine his studies chiefly to sherds, has
created too many subdivisions for his Coles Creek
decoration complex.

pages, including 183 drawings, and photographs,
of which over fifty are photographs. It contains a

When one observes the results of the finely
detailed technical study which has been devoted to
this skull of disputed antiquity, he is moved to a
sad contemplation of the fact that in Texas he has
found close to fifty, extremely dolichocephalic, and
evidently otherwise more primitive type skeletons,
buried on high bluffs, either immediately above, or
not far from the deepest buried ancient floor
middens, thus far found in America, and that on no
one of these has there been lavished such detailed
attention by any physical anthropologist so far as
he knows.
Dr. Jenks has certainly gone minutely into every
detail concerning this find. His industrious research
is to be commended. The writer being a physician,
and not a physical anthropologist, will necessarily
confine his comment’s to general observations
concerning the skull as shown in the illustrations,
and will make comparisons with Abilene skulls.

The skull as shown in the photographs in norma
lateralis, or from the side, has a considerable
resemblance to the numerous skulls of the
excessively dolichocephalic race discovered by this
writer near Abilene (Abilene Man), in two respects:
first, it has the occipital bun or protrusion of the
posterior portion of the skull characteristic of
Abilene Man, and it also has nearly as much
prognathism. However, its frontal region is not near

The Amateur in Archaeology
Any discussion of amateurs and professionals
in archaeology becomes intelligent only after these
two classes are defined. Simply stated, the amateur
differs from the professional in that the latter is paid
for his services, whereas the former is motivated
by interest only. Both categories fall under the
general head of “students”; otherwise, use of the
term “archaeologist” is hardly permissible. A
collector of archaeological materials may or may
not be a student, depending upon the purposes
underlying his collecting activities and the use he
makes of the valuable data so acquired.
Use of the term “amateur” sometimes carries a
different significance. According to Funk and
Wagnall’s Standard Dictionary, 1933, a second
definition is: “Often, one who amuses himself with
an art, but is not a master of it; one who makes
more or less pretense to practicing an art without
having undergone professional preparation.” In this
article I am less interested in such a definition, since
it does not describe the student type of amateur
with whom I am solely concerned. Moreover, I
doubt if any of us can more than presume to be
“masters” of our subject, regardless of “professional
preparation.” Personally, I should much rather be
called a student than an authority, since a student is
capable of learning whereas an authority presumably
already knows it all. A student may uncover new
facts, but one who is merely an authority can only
cite previously established facts.
American archaeology is destined to progress
only if it is kept alive through the activities of
students, whether they be professional or amateur.
In fact, leaving out of consideration the matter of
financial remuneration, which has nothing directly
to do with the subject of archaeology, we are all in
the same boat and headed in the same direction.
Granting that some are more experienced sailors
than others, it does not necessarily follow that the
professional in every instance is the better sailor.
Nor does it follow that an amateur cannot equip

himself with training sufficient to render his potential
services inferior to none.
The question, therefore, is not: what can the
amateur do, but rather: what can any student do
toward advancing American archaeology. The
answer to the question, regardless of how it may
be stated, is always the same: the service that any
student can render is in direct ratio to the sum of
his archaeological training and his supply of “horse
sense.” Regardless of the salary he may or may not
receive for his work, the student’s usefulness
depends upon his ability to define problems, and to
employ technical methods tending toward the
solution of those problems.
It should be apparent to all that one should not
attempt the impossible by engaging in phases of
the work for which he has received no adequate
preparation. A man without surgical training would
hardly attempt a major operation; if he did, the
results would: probably be fatal to the patient.
Similarly, one without sound training both in
archaeological theory and practice should not
attempt a major archaeological excavation; to do
so would without doubt result (as in thousands of
instances it has resulted) in the destruction and
permanent loss of archaeological information, the
securing and preservation of which would comprise
the only legitimate purpose of the excavation. A
knowledge of facts and methods, and thorough
experience in practice, are just as necessary for
successful work in archaeology as in any other
highly technical profession.
It follows that a student of archaeology should
properly confine his research activities to a field
well within the limitations of his acquired ability.
At the outset, the major portion of his task is that
of learning facts and theories, relating to his and
related fields, that have accumulated from previous
work. Collecting surface materials and studying
materials existing in available collections should
work in well with this initial study period. The
saving of accidentally disturbed artifacts, for

Editorials
example: stone points unearthed by the plow, and
any associated information that otherwise might
never be recorded, resulting in a permanent loss of
the scientific value of the specimens, is a service of
no small importance that can be rendered by
relatively inexperienced collector-students.

109

Amateur students in other scientific subjects,
geology and astronomy for example, have in
instances achieved marked success and well-earned
renown in their selected fields of endeavor, as,
indeed, they have in archaeology, but only after long
years of specialization, involving plenty of hard
work. It is to be hoped that all amateur students of
American archaeology will meet honestly and
without illusion the issue of study and training
required for any worthwhile participation in
research. It is entirely worth the effort, if one is
interested.

Some students will become interested in
archaeological survey work. The crudest map
showing surface features in a certain area is of some
value, and the value is augmented proportionately
with increased care and precision, and the adoption
of improved technique by the surveyor. Copies of

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society
Dr. Walter Hough’s Visit

Texas Should Retain Its Scientific Finds

In May, 1929, Dr. Walter Hough of The National
Museum visited Abilene, and was shown various
sites here. Among others visited he was conducted
to the huge Indian Red Paint Mine described in the
Vol. 1, 1929, Bulletin of The Society. While
returning from that site, one of the party, E. B.
Sayles, photographed those present. It so happened
that most of the officers of the Society then, and
since, were in the party. Only three of the then
resident directors were absent, the absent ones being
Dr. R. N. Richardson, Dr. W. C. Holden, and Mr.
H. G. Payne.

In the week of March 17-20, 1937, the Editor
attended The International Symposium on Early
Man, held by The Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A museum
case full of the skulls and long bones of Abilene
Man were put on exhibition there. This meeting
was composed of several hundred delegates from
all parts of the world, which included many of the
leading anthropologists of the world. The exhibits
afforded a wonderful opportunity to those attending
to see the skeletal material of the most ancient
human types known.

prehistoric animals from Texas occupy prominent
places in these museums. A place should be made
in Texas for such fossils. The Editor at that time
gave to the National Museum, in Washington, three
of his rare Abilene Man skulls. According to one of
the staff, there were about twenty thousand’ skulls
in the Museum’s collection, but previously no
examples of this Texas type had been placed there.
He hopes that it will not be necessary to place all
of these Abilene Man skulls in museums outside of
the State of Texas, because of a lack of interest in
the State in providing proper places for them.
Millions of Texas money is going into grandstand
sports, and carnivalistic exhibitions of doubtful, if
not harmful values, and into other such trivial things,
while practically no provision is being made for
visual education. Some one has said that one picture
is worth five thousand words, which is doubtless
true, but it is also true that one good look at an
object by an observant person is worth more to
him than is a book on that subject. The schools of
Texas will never be what they should be until they
provide museums so that the minority who really

111

desire an education in something aside from
football, will be enabled to get the exact knowledge
to which they are entitled. Properly educate these
few, and the mass of those who throng our
educational institutions can well be left to their own
devices, because from these few alone will proceed
all of the future culture, progress and development
of Texas. The world is already doing too much for
the never-do-wells, the misfits, the lazy louts, and
the enemies of Democracy. It needs to seek out
and comb the population for the worthy,
industrious, and talented few, and really give them
the opportunity to fully capitalize their talents. As
it is now whenever an unusually brilliant person
develops in Texas we have provided an environment
which usually causes him to leave for New England
or other eastern States, where he finds both the
encouragement and the physical equipment with
