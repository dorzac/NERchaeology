October 2014

Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of the proposed TX-03
Cedar-Lewis Cellular Tower in central Terry County, Texas. The Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required,
but subsequent review of this archaeological report was provided by the Texas Historical
Commission’s Archeology Division. The total area to be impacted is 2,500 square feet (<0.06
acres), in addition to a 30-foot access/utility easement.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on October 7, 2014. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the six shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to oversee
development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any
previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development, work should
immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and evaluated by Tierras
Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

Three individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to the successful
planning, organization, and completion of this project are Ms. Jayne Aaron, Architectural
Historian and Senior Environmental Planner at AARCHER, Inc., Mr. Chris Baker, Historian at
AARCHER and Mr. Bill Martin, Federal Programs Reviewer at the Texas Historical
Commission’s Office of Historic Preservation.

funding was involved in the proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking.
In October 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or within
one mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area

Project Environment
The Project Area lies within the central area of Terry County, on the southern end of the High
Plains Region. The High Plains, with its silty clay loams and stony clays in the valleys overlying
Permian-age silt and sandstone beds, covers nearly all of Terry County. Geologically, the area
provides abundant outcrops of limestone and gravels from the Edwards limestone and San Angelo
conglomerate formations. Physiographically, the region falls in the Northwest Margin of the
Edwards Plateau Section of the Great Plains province. However, more specifically, the terrain
within Terry County is generally level, covered with sandy loam soils, broken only by broad draws
and playas, while sand hills dominate the northeastern portion of the county. Elevation in Terry
County ranges from 3,100 to 3,600 feet above mean sea level (Fenneman 1931; Hunt and Leffler
1996; Sanders 1962).
Modern Climate and Hydrology
The modern climate of the Terry County area is classified as semi-arid, though humidity, often
in excess of 40 percent, is high for such a characterization. Large fluctuations in temperature occur
throughout the year, with average temperatures ranging from 93 degrees during the Summer to
around 26 degrees in the Winter. The average annual precipitation is just over 17 inches, though
significant fluctuations are common. The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns
results in frequent droughts as well as periods of abundant moisture. In modern times, there are
no constantly flowing streams in Terry County. Although, numerous draws that hold water from
periodic rainfalls eventually distribute the overflow into the upper watershed of Sulphur Springs
Creek (Sanders 1962; Hunt and Leffler 1996).
Soils
As shown in Figure 4, the TX-03 Cedar-Lewis Tower is to be constructed in Patricia and Amarillo
loamy fine sand (PAB), commonly found on 0 to 3 percent sloping broad valleys in this area of
Terry County (Sanders 1962; WebSoil Survey Online 2014). A typical soil pedon of Patricia and
Amarillo loamy fine sand is as follows:
0 to 10 inches – Light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam; few small clods; few and very fine hard
calcium carbonate concretions; strongly calcareous; abrupt lower boundary
10 to 14 inches – Light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam; common insect casts and burrows, few very
fine rootlets; very strongly calcareous; clear lower boundary
14 to 28 inches – Light gray (2.5Y 7/2) clay loam; moderate, fine, granular; common insect casts
and burrows, few very fine rootlets; very strongly calcareous; gradual lower boundary
28 to 40 inches – White (2.5Y 8/2) clay loam; nearly pure calcium carbonate

Cultural Chronology
The location of the TX-03 Cedar-Lewis Celluar Tower survey area presumes cultural affinities
indigenous to the Southern Great Plains (Figure 5), also referred to as the southern extension of
the North American High Plains. Several scholars have offered sound but differing arguments for
cultural chronologies for the Southern Great Plains extending into northern Texas, and the Project
Area. The cultural chronology, defined by complex (in lieu of the terms phase, interval, or period)
of the North American High Plains has been synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and more
recently, the Southern High Plains in Texas by Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd (1995).
It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by shifts in climatic
conditions and subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are indicators of change in
central and south Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived from Johnson and
Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are approximate and
given as years before present (B.P.).

Pre-Clovis

may have inhabited
the landscape before
11,500 B.P, solid
evidence does not

existence. At

( S t a n f o r d

landforms are not
likely to yield solid stratigraphic proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we
do find earlier occupations on stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis
culture? The Gault Site in Bell County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage
in all of North America, and with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component,
likely has the best chances of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas
(Adavasio and Page 2002:292-294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains were
occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom, and other complex peoples between approximately
11,500-8000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people who
made them (e.g., Wenke 1990:201). Within Texas’ political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007)
have documented the presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
5

ochre, and shaft straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called “Goshen” may be present (Hofman 1989:34; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
A well-documented Paleoindian Clovis site in the southern Great Plains is the McLean site in
Taylor County, west of Abilene (Ray and Bryan 1938; Sellards 1952). Folsom sites in the area
include the Scharbauer site in northwestern Midland County (Wendorf et al. 1955), and the
Adair-Steadman site in north central Nolan County (Tunnel 1977). By far, the most robust
collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in Bell County, Texas.
Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been recovered, with only
about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison (Bison
antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940), archaeological
evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either extinct or
otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope,
and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required technological
shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman
1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano Estacado
from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of megafauna and
the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral change by the
Prehistoric inhabitants (McKinney 1981). While the basic hunter-gatherer adaptation probably
remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was necessary. Weir (1976)
speculates that Early Archaic groups were small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that
Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area,
including most of Texas and northern Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline in the number
of bison on the plains forced the inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants and animals
which would produce the same amount of calories and protein with the same or slightly more
effort expended. Using projectile points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues that the Terry
County area was used more frequently in the Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic,
6

probably due to a “...decline of bison and other game animals on the Southern Plains”. Story
(1985), however, believes that population densities were low during this period, and that groups
consisted of related individuals in small bands with “...few constraints on their mobility” (Story
1985:39). Their economy was based on diffuse utilization of a wide range of resources, especially
such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer
(Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:45-47), and more
specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The reasons for
this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal) during the
Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story 1985:40).
Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains
decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet.
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as
the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to
the Southern Great Plains area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as
mussel shells during the Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared
(Dillehay 1974). Hurt (1980) further posits that population in the Terry County area peaked during
the Late Archaic with groups moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex
of artifacts found in the region were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points. The most common are
Ensor and Frio types, both of which are short, triangular points with side notches. The Frio point
also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in central Texas, while the term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the
Southern Great Plains. Two complexes following the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains
region are the Plains Woodland from about 2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450
B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90).
Huebner (1991) suggests that the sudden return of bison to central Texas resulted from a more
xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak
Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into the South Texas Plain along the
eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau (Huebner 1991:354-355). Sites from this period frequently
have associated bison (e.g., Black 1986; Black and McGraw 1985). However, according to Hurt
(1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is mirrored
7

in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due to the
increased alkalinity in the region’s water sources. “It is interesting to note that a Neo-Indian site
characterized by Perdiz points is known from the South Concho, but do not occur in the Middle
Concho area. This might suggest that the Middle Concho received scant visitation during this
period, and insufficient use as to leave detectable archeological evidence” (Hurt 1980:107).
Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups. Hofman (1989:91) agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time
when there were limited European contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but
no proper history”. The cultural context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely
conditioned by the presence of outside ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous
small groups of Jumanos and Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish
intrusions are addressed in many sources (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester
1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as
Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers
1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on the
Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994;
Johnson and Campbell 1992). The establishment and relocation of Spanish Catholic missions along
the Concho, San Saba, and San Antonio Rivers in the late 1600s and early 1700s induced many
groups to seek the relative comfort and protection offered by a sedentary, apparently well-fed, and
peaceful coexistence (Campbell and Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja 1995; Habig 1968a,
1968b; Hard et al 1995; Inglis 1964). Although fear of the invading Apache and Comanche
pressured many of the Indians to seek the protection of missions, they were now exposed to the
exploitation of the Spanish (Campbell 1975:2, 1991:346-347).
In the autumn of 1785, a peace treaty with the Comanches signaled the opening of a period of
peaceful coexistence in which Comanches brought hides, meat, and tallow to the area to trade for
goods and services not available elsewhere, such as blacksmithing and gun repair (Poyo and
Hinojosa 1991:125-126). The few Comanches who entered the missions were apparently women
and children who were captured during punitive raids by Spanish soldiers (Campbell and Campbell
8

1985:26). Meanwhile, local Jumano Indians encouraged the Spanish to establish missions in the
area in the 1600s, and Apache, Kiowa, and Comanche Indians used the Terry County area as a
hunting ground, exploiting the vast herds of buffalo. However, white buffalo hunters depleted the
herds by the late 1870s , and the Indians continued raiding local ranches so that the area remained
largely unsettled country until the latter part of the nineteenth century (Hunt and Leffler 1996;
Smith 1996).
Despite their considerable achievements in material culture and adaptation to their environment,
the Indians lost their domination of the region to the United States Army and the advancing tide
of white settlers in the 1870s and 1880s. In the 1890s, Texas offered attractive ten-year leases on
school lands for grazing cattle, and white settlers filtered in. In 1904, Terry County was officially
organized, with Brownfield as the county seat. The county was still very sparsely populated even
into the first quarter of the 20th century, with large ranches on thousands of acres of pastureland.
However, by 1930 farmers turned the soil and began raising primarily corn and cotton. Somehow
they survived the Great Depression and severe droughts. In 1940, oil was discovered in the
county, within the oil-rich Permian Basin, and oil and gas production have been a significant
economic and population stimuli ever since (Hunt and Leffler 1996).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
A review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the TX-03 Cedar-Lewis Tower site had not been
subjected to a cultural resources survey. As shown in Figure 3, there had been no cultural
resources surveys nor archaeological sites recorded within one mile of the proposed TX-03 CedarLewis Cell Tower site (Atlas 2014). However, there are three Historical Markers within one mile;
they are as follows:
Daugherty House – Built for F. M. Daugherty about 1904, one year after son-in-law A. M.
Brownfield helped found town. Lumber was hauled here by wagon. Style is typical of era. Site of
early gatherings. Later home of the local midwife. Has been remodeled. Recorded Texas Historic
Landmark, 1969.
City of Brownfield – County seat of Terry County, founded in 1903 by developers W. G. Hardin
and A. F. Small. Named for Brownfield family, prominent property owners and ranchers in the
area. Measuring with only 100 feet of wire, Hardin and Small laid out a town on this site (then a
pasture) and offered a lot to each voter in county. Streets (named for first settlers) were designated
and a general store, hotel, and school were built. In 1904 the town vied with Gomez for county
seat, winning by slim margin. Present economy is based on farming and oil. (1971)
Colonel B. F. Terry and Terry’s Texas Rangers – Native of Kentucky. Came to Texas 1831.
Member Secession Convention. Commanded reinforcements of state troops sent to Rio Grande
for the capture of Federal arms, property at Fort Brown. Went to Virginia hoping to be in first
battle of war. Cited for valuable volunteer service in first Battle of Manassas. Returned to Texas
with orders to raise cavalry regiment which soon attained fame as Terry's Rangers. Accepted his
9

commission only when men elected him Colonel. Killed Woodsonville, Kentucky leading unit's first
charge. His loyal Rangers carried his name until war's end. Buried Glenwood Cemetery, Houston.
Terry's Texas Rangers - Ten companies of the "Kid Glove" gentry of Texas enlisted for the
duration of the Civil War, forming the famed Terry's Texas Rangers. With their able leaders, this
8th Texas Cavalry Regiment joined Johnston's command in Kentucky. History finds it easy to call
these Texas men fighters. They were excellent horsemen, marksmen, utterly reckless. Individual
heroism was not uncommon. Their deeds were praised at Shiloh, Murfreesboro, Chickamauga,
Bragg's Raid into Kentucky and their last charge at Bentonville, N.C. Called upon to cover
retreats, to invade enemy lines to get information, harass the enemy and to lead charges.
As of October 19, 2014, there were 30 documented archaeological sites in Terry County, and
together they begin to convey only a brief glimpse of how the landscape may have been exploited
over the past several millennia in the area. It is evident that humans have lived in the area from the
Paleoindian interval, perhaps as long as 11,500 years ago. Notably, despite a Texas Antiquities
Code and federal laws governing development, only in 1989 was the first archaeological site
recorded in Terry County. By and large, the majority of sites recorded in the county has been done
by avocational archaeologists, and the majority of these sites have been found around playas on
the open plains.
Of the 30 sites, 23 have been classified as prehistoric open campsites, ranging in age from the
Paleoindian through the early Historic periods. At one of these campsites, archaeologists have
documented a human burial with bone beads and ceremonial-like stone tools. Other sites include
a human skeleton eroding from a cutbank, one site that is an apparent bison killsite where a Fresno
arrow point was observed imbedded within a bison bone, one site where pottery, hammerstones,
and manos were documented, and one site where a Chupadero pottery sherd found suggests an
intrusive influence from what is today the modern New Mexico area (Atlas 2014).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site type,
distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. Excavation of the shovel tests
were terminated at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs).

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
The immediate area of the leased 2,500 square-foot tower area lay in a cultivated, but very recently
fallow portion of a cotton field. As shown in Figures 6 and 7, the leased area was overgrown with
weeds in October 2014. A surface examination revealed no evidence of either raw lithic material,
or cultural material.
Six shovel tests placed within the leased area and within the entryway from N. Cedar Street
(Figure 8) generally revealed red (10R 4/6) fine sandy loam to 30 cmbs, underlain by dusky red
(10R 3/3) fine sandy loam, with a blocky, fine, weak structure with calcium carbonate fines.
Otherwise, no lithics were observed, and no cultural material was observed in any of the six shovel
tests. The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms, are on file at
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, and are available upon request.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the Project
Area was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated, but no evidence of neither prehistoric
nor historic occupation was found. Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as
currently designed by the project sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect”
on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed
without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are
examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and
by the Texas Historical Commission.
