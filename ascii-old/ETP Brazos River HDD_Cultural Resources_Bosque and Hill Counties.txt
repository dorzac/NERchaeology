Abstract

Abstract
This document describes the results of the Phase I cultural resources survey of the proposed Energy
Transfer (ET) Brazos River Horizontal Directional Drill (HDD) location associated with the proposed
J.C. Nolan Pipeline Project in Bosque and Hill counties, Texas. ET has conducted bathymetric surveys
of the existing pipeline crossing of the Brazos River (Lake Whitney) and it is considering proactive
measures to lower the pipeline. If it is determined to lower the pipeline beneath the Brazos River, the
Project will consist of using HDD technology to drill a 30.5-centimeter (cm; 12-inch [in]) pipeline
approximately 9.2 meters (30.2 feet) below the river. AECOM Technical Services, Inc. (AECOM), on
behalf of ET, conducted the Phase I investigation between April 23 and 25, 2019. In total, an area
measuring 2.9 hectares (7.2 acres [ac]) was examined for cultural resources.
This investigation was designed to identify and evaluate any cultural resources, such as historic and
prehistoric archaeological sites, historic standing structures, and cemeteries, which may be located
within the area of disturbance associated with the Project. This investigation followed the guidelines
and procedures outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended; the
Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974; 33 CFR 325 Appendix C - Procedures for the
Protection of Historic Properties; and, Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and
800, as appropriate. Additionally, this survey effort abided by the standards set forth in Archeology and
Historic Preservation: The Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines and with guidelines contained within
Preservation Connection: Texas’ Statewide Historic Preservation Plan 2011–2020 (THS 2011a).
Information provided by the Council of Texas Archeologists, the Texas Archaeological Research
Laboratory, the Antiquities Code of Texas, and the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Archeological
Survey Standards For Texas and Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas
(THC 2011b) also was utilized. Any impacts the Project may have on wetlands and water bodies will
be permitted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers related to actions under Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. §1251 et seq.) and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act
of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403). Thus, the Project is subject to review under Section 106 of the NHPA (16
USC 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).
Pedestrian survey, augmented by the excavation of 22 shovel tests, failed to reveal the presence of
any surface or subsurface cultural materials. Likewise, no potentially intact cultural soils were
observed. Finally, no historic built resources were identified as a result of this survey. Consequently,
AECOM recommends a finding of no historic properties affected and further recommends no further
investigations be conducted.

Chapter 1. Introduction

Introduction

This document describes the results of the Phase I cultural resources survey of the proposed Energy
Transfer (ET) Brazos River Horizontal Directional Drill (HDD) location associated with the proposed
J.C. Nolan Pipeline Project (Project) in Bosque and Hill counties, Texas (Figure 1.1). ET has conducted
bathymetric surveys of the existing pipeline crossing of the Brazos River (Lake Whitney) and is
considering proactive measures to lower the pipeline. If it is determined to lower the pipeline beneath
the Brazos River, the Project will consist of using HDD technology to drill a 30.5-centimeter (cm; 12inch [in]) pipeline approximately 9.2 meters (m; 30.2 feet [ft]) below the river. AECOM Technical
Services, Inc. (AECOM), on behalf of ET, conducted the Phase I investigation between April 23 and
25, 2019. In total, an area measuring 2.9 hectares (ha; 7.2 acres [ac]) was examined for cultural
resources.
This investigation was designed to identify and evaluate any cultural resources, such as historic and
prehistoric archaeological sites, historic standing structures, and cemeteries, which may be located
within the area of disturbance associated with the Project. This investigation followed the guidelines
and procedures outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended; the
Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974; 33 CFR 325 Appendix C - Procedures for the
Protection of Historic Properties; and, Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and
800, as appropriate. Additionally, this survey effort abided by the standards set forth in Archeology and
Historic Preservation: The Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines and with guidelines contained within
Preservation Connection: Texas’ Statewide Historic Preservation Plan 2011–2020 (THC 2011a).
Information provided by the Council of Texas Archeologists, the Texas Archaeological Research
Laboratory, the Antiquities Code of Texas, and the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Archeological
Survey Standards For Texas and Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas
(THC 2011b) also was utilized.
As currently proposed, the crossing spans approximately 1,681.3 m (5,516 ft) of the Brazos River. Any
impacts the Project may have on wetlands and water bodies will be permitted by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) related to actions under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of
1972 (33 U.S.C. §1251 et seq.) and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403).
Therefore, because this is a federal undertaking, this Project is subject to review under Section 106 of
the NHPA (16 USC 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).
The Project area is depicted on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle maps of Morgan, TX and Lakeside Village, TX. The pipeline replacement itself will occur
in ET’s existing, disturbed pipeline corridor. However, additional temporary workspace will be required
for pipe stringing, contractor parking, and laydown (Figure 1.2). Such workspace will be located outside
the existing, disturbed corridor, and its potential to contain intact cultural resources is unknown. Thus,
this cultural resources inventory was limited to those proposed additional temporary workspace
locations.
Mr. James Eberwine, M.S., R.P.A. served as Principal Investigator and directed the fieldwork for the
Project. Mr. Eberwine was assisted in the field by Mr. Gary Hawkins, B.A., and Ms. Patricia Hutchins,
B.A. The graphics contained within this report were created by Ms. Helen Potter, B.S., while Ms.
Wanda Shelton produced the document.
Chapter 2 of this report provides a brief background on the natural and cultural settings of the Project
area. Chapter 3 describes the results of background research and the field methodologies utilized to
complete the investigation. Chapter 4 summarizes the results of the investigations. In addition, two
appendices are included in the document. Appendix I depicts the soil profiles observed in each
excavated shovel test, while Appendix II contains a copy of the previously submitted and approved
Scope of Work.

Natural and Cultural Settings

2.1

Natural Setting

Chapter 2. Natural and Cultural Settings

The regional landscape strongly influences the preservation and subsequent identification of any
archeological materials that may have been deposited within the proposed Project areas. The Project
items are located within the eastern Grand Prairie physiographic region, which developed on limestones
and calcareous shales (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). The Project area is underlain by the
Cretaceous-era Fredericksburg and L. Washita geologic groups (Bureau of Economic Geology 1992).
The area is adapted primarily to agriculture, particularly raising livestock and growing staple crops, and
it is generally treeless except along the streambanks (Texas Almanac 2018). The area is characterized
by thin, rocky soils arising from weathering and erosion. The eastern Grand Prairie Region is typified by
plains ranging in elevation from 137 to 381 m above sea level (asl; [450 to 1250 ft asl]); a strata
dip characterizes the eastern side of the Region (BEG 1996; United States Department of Agriculture
2008).
Due to the Project area’s proximity to the Brazos River and the peculiarities of the Fredricksburg group
there, soils within the Project are generally deeper and less eroded than those in much of the Grand
Prairie Region (Brooks 1978). Soils on the west side of the river are comprised from the Bastrop,
Minwells, Slidell, and Sunev series (Figure 2.1). All are characterized as deep, well-drained soils. Slidell
soils are found on uplands, and Bastrop, Minwells, and Sunev soils are found on stream terraces.
Bastrop soils are loamy and sandy and are formed in thick beds of loamy alluvial sediments. Minwells
soils are loamy and are formed in thick beds of loamy and gravelly alluvial sediments. Sunev soils are
loamy and are formed in alluvium along major streams (Stringer 1980).
Soils on the east side of the river are comprised from the Aledo, Bastsil, Brackett, Burleson, Gowen, and
Krum series. Aledo and Brackett soils are shallow, loamy soils. Aledo soils are underlain by hard,
coarsely fractured limestone at a depth of less than 50.8 cm (20 in). Brackett soils are formed in
interbedded soft limestone and marly earth. Bastsil soils are deep, sandy or loamy soils found on uplands
and formed in loamy sediments on stream terraces. Burleson soils are deep, nearly level, clayey soils
found on old stream terraces. They are formed in alkaline, clayey sediments. Gowen soils are deep,
loamy soils and are formed in noncalcareous loamy sediments in floodplains. Krum soils are deep,
clayey soils that formed in thick beds of unconsolidated, calcareous sediments on old high terraces and
valley fills (Brooks 1978).

2.2

Cultural Setting

The Project area falls within the Prairie-Savanna study region of the Eastern Archaeological Planning
Region as defined by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Researchers have divided the region
into chronological periods based on archaeological evidence obtained from investigations principally
related to grant-funded reconnaissance (primarily carried out by the University of Texas), reservoir
construction, mining operations, Soil Conservation Service projects, water treatment, utility and energy
line construction, and federally-funded highway projects. Table 2.1 depicts the chronological periods
for the Project area. A brief overview of each period is below.

The Paleoindian period is the earliest defined cultural period in North America. Most of the evidence
of the period in the region consists of isolated finds of projectile points; generally, the point types are
non-local and are made of non-local materials. There is usually meager occupational debris, and, while
some bison remains have been identified, much of the faunal remains are from small mammals and
land turtles. Overall, archaeological evidence suggests that small, highly mobile groups inhabited or
passed through the region during the Paleoindian period (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
Although sites from this period within the study region are extremely rare, a Paleoindian component
was identified at Site 41BQ46, the Horn Shelter No. 2 Site, which is a rock shelter located
approximately 32 km (20 mi) south of the proposed project area (Bousman, et al. 2004). A number of
sealed Paleoindian deposits were identified within the site, and diagnostic artifact recoveries included
Folsom, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff projectile points, as well as a possible Clovis point. Radiocarbon
dates for these deposits ranged from 9500 +/- 200 BP to 10,310 +/- 150 B.P. (Bousman, et al. 2004).
In addition, a double burial consisting of a Paleoindian adult and child was identified at Site 41BQ46.
Both skeletons were nearly complete, and numerous grave goods, such as shell beads, bird claws,
bone and stone tools, and perforated nonhuman canines also were identified in association with the
bodies. The cranium of the adult was placed in a turtle carapace, and two other turtle carapaces were
placed near the face and pelvis of the body. Both individuals were characterized as male, and the adult
was estimated to be between 160-167.6 cm (63-66 in) in height (Bousman, et al. 2004).
Near the end of the Paleoindian period, global climate began to change slowly, becoming gradually
warmer and dryer (Brown and Lebo 1991). In response, plant and animal populations also changed
and the human populations in north Texas began to exploit a wider variety of food resources.
Archaeological evidence of Early and Middle Archaic groups within the Prairie-Savannah study region
is sparse. Artifacts from the Early and Middle Archaic periods are restricted to projectile points and
they often come from culturally-mixed soil deposits or from surface finds. Projectile points from the
Early and Middle Archaic are usually less carefully fashioned and are made from less exotic materials
than those from the Paleoindian Period (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
In comparison to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased population
and site density. Artifacts from the Late Archaic period are characterized by projectile points made of
local materials and an increased density of occupational debris and features, such as hearths and
floral remains. Burned rock midden features dating from the latter part of the Middle Archaic and the
Late Archaic periods, absent in most of the study region, have been identified in Bosque County
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

Chapter 2. Natural and Cultural Settings

The Late Prehistoric periods are marked by the introduction of bow-and-arrow technology, ceramics,
house structures, and corn horticulture. Changes in ceramic and arrow point types distinguish the Late
Prehistoric I from the Late Prehistoric II period. Additionally, archeological evidence shows a more
varied assemblage during Late Prehistoric II, including thumbnail scrapers, knives, drills, digging
sticks, and hoes (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
The Historic Indian period generally coincided with the arrival of the first Spanish and French peoples
in the region. Archaeological sites from the period are extremely rare in the Prairie-Savannah study
region; all sites identified thus far are village sites associated with the Wichita Confederacy, a group
that moved from the Oklahoma-Kansas border region into northern Texas in the mid-1700s. Many of
the sites are heavily damaged; however, the Vinson Site (Limestone County) remains largely intact.
Archaeological excavation there revealed eight burned house floors and a mixture of European trade
goods, such as beads, metal arrowpoints, and gun parts; and native-made items, such as ceramics,
hide scrapers, and ground stone tools. Documentary evidence from early European explorers in the
region lists several groups, including the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai (Kichai),
Yojaunce, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
The Stansbury Site, Site 41HI9, was a Historic Indian village site that is located approximately 19.3
km (12.0 mi) southeast of the Project area. Stephenson (1970) hypothesized that the Stansbury Site
represents the former location of the Flechado Village of the Tawkoni Indians. The Tawkoni were
closely related to the Wichitas, and the village was established between 1772 and 1778, and
abandoned between 1780 and 1786. Stephenson described the site as a, “large, open, occupation
area on the edge of the upper, or 40-foot, terrace of the Brazos River…two miles above the Whitney
Dam” (Stephenson 1970:104). Investigations conducted at the site in 1947 and 1950 identified, “four
burials, a stone wall, several “piles” of bison bones, a series of unpatterned postholes, and an
aboriginal dwelling structure” (Stephenson 1970:104). The artifact sub-assemblage recovered from
the site includes both Native American and European/American trade goods. In addition to the Tawkoni
occupation, the site likely was reoccupied in the middle nineteenth century by a Hainai Native
American group. At that time, the site was referred to as the Old Towash Village. These groups likely
were relocated to Oklahoma Territory in 1870 (Stephenson 1970).
The first European explorers to enter what is now Bosque County were Spanish missionaries, who
arrived in 1721. In Hill County, the first European was probably Pedro Vial, a Frenchman hired by the
Spanish to find a route to Santa Fe from San Antonio, in 1786 (Austin 2016; Strickland 2018). Before
Texas independence, while under the control of Mexico, several empresario grants were awarded by
Mexico to populate the territory (Haaser 2010; Hardy, et al. nd). Settlement in both Bosque and Hill
counties began with these land grants. In Bosque County, the first settler was Sterling C. Robertson;
in Hill County, the first settler was Peter Fleming. Both men were issued grants in 1825. Within a few
years, Robertson also received much of the land that would become Hill County and, in 1835, he gave
grants to several other families that he recruited to settle the area. Few homesteaders opted to settle
within Bosque County until 1841, when a military expedition passed through the region and many of
those associated travelers decided to stay. In 1847, the town of Kimball was established in Bosque
County in an effort to bring more settlers to the area. The first town in Hill County was established in
1849 and it surrounded Fort Graham. The fort was abandoned in 1853, but the town remained (Austin
2016; Strickland 2018).
Hill County was created from a portion of Navarro County in 1853 and Bosque County was formed
from a portion of McLennan County in 1854. Hillsborough and Meridian were chosen as the respective
county seats, and in both counties, town lots were sold to the public for settlement. Many Norwegians
settled in the less-densely populated Bosque County following an offer by the state of Texas to grant
320 acres to anyone willing to settle in the new county (Austin 2016; Strickland 2018).

Both counties voted for secession in the Civil War. However, while Hill County supported three cavalry
units and established home guards, most of the soldiers in Bosque County guarded the area from
local Native Americans. Both counties grew during the latter half of the nineteenth century. The
population of Bosque County was enumerated at 4,981 in 1870; 11,216 in 1880; and 17,390 in 1900.
Similarly, Hill County’s population was enumerated at 3,653 in 1860; 7,453 in 1870; and 41,355 in
1900. However, population of both counties began to fall during the early twentieth century as declining
farm prices discouraged agriculture and as manufacturers left the area.
Erosion and drought conditions worsened the agricultural decline in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.
Manufacturing, primarily related to lumber, limestone, oilfield-tool manufacturing, and textiles, began
to increase in Bosque County during the 1940s and 1950s and grew substantially in the 1970s and
1980s. Manufacturing decreased in Hill County over the same period, but employment opportunities
in service industries such as medical care and retail rose significantly. As of 2014, 17,780 people lived
in Bosque County and 34,848 lived in Hill County (Austin 2016; Strickland 2018).

Previous Investigations and Background Research

A review was undertaken of those previously completed cultural resources surveys, previously
recorded archeological sites, built resources greater than 50 years in age, cemeteries, historic
markers, and properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) situated within 1.0
kilometer (km) (0.6 mile [mi]) of the proposed Project. That review utilized the data stored electronically
on the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA). The results of the data collection are
summarized below.

3.1.1 Previously Completed Cultural Resources Surveys
A total of seven previously completed cultural resources investigations were identified within 1.6 km
(1.0 mi) of the proposed Project items, and very few data were present on the abstracts present on
TASA (Figure 2; Table 2). Two of the surveys were sponsored by The Smithsonian Institution in 1947.
These investigations were conducted by Robert L. Stephenson during the Texas River Basin Surveys
(RBS) program. Jelks (2014) indicated that these salvage investigations were initiated in 1945, and
they examined over 40 reservoir projects and located and recorded approximately 1,600 archeological
sites. Stephenson discussed some of the sites he identified during his survey of the Whitney Basin in
Volume 18 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society (Stephenson 1947),
a more robust discussion of those investigations was included in Volume 41 of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Survey (Stevenson 1970).
Although not recorded on TASA, archeologists associated with Southern Methodist University (SMU)
conducted additional investigations near the Project area in anticipation of an expansion to Lake
Whitney (Skinner and Gallagher 1974; Lynott 1978). Electronic copies of the SMU reports could not
be identified, and they also were not available from local archives. However, based on correspondence
with the USACE, Skinner and Gallager recorded 29 new sites, including Sites 41BQ90 and 41BQ91
(see below; Daniel McGregor, personal communication, 2019)
Of the remaining surveys, two were sponsored by the USACE, Fort Worth District, and they were
Section 110 compliance efforts completed by Ecological Communications Corporation in 2008 and
2009 (Nickels, et al. 2008; Jones 2009). Both were large-scale surveys that examined properties near
Lake Whitney. When combined, the investigations identified 15 new archeological sites and revisited
three others. Of those sites, Sites 41BQ90, 41BQ290, and 41HI33 were located near the proposed
Project areas. While the study authors recommended no additional work for Sites 41BQ90 and
41BQ290, Site 41HI33 was assessed as eligible for listing in the NRHP, and avoidance was
recommended.
Fieldwork for the final investigation was completed in 2015 by Turpin and Sons, Inc. (Turner 2015).
While the report does not appear on TASA, a copy was provided to AECOM by Mr. Daniel McGregor
of the USACE, Fort Worth District. The survey, which utilized pedestrian survey and shovel testing to
assess large portions of the currently proposed Project areas, did not identify any cultural resources.

3.1.2 Previously Identified Archeological Sites
Seven archeological sites were identified near the proposed Project items (Table 3.2). As mentioned
above, Stephenson (1947) identified four sites, which include 41HI26, 41HI27, 41HI32, and 41HI33.
Site 41BQU90 was identified by Hyatt in 1972 and was revisited by Jones, et al. in 2009, who also
recorded Site 41BQ290. The examined site form for the final site, Site 41BQ91, indicates that it was
identified by Skinner in 1971.
Only Site 41BQ290 was characterized as a late nineteenth to early twentieth century homestead. It
was assessed as not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
The six remaining sites were characterized on TASA as prehistoric, and they included three middens
(41BQ91, 41HI26, 41HI27), a rock shelter (41HI32), a campsite (41BQ90), and an artifact scatter
(41HI33). One of the middens, the campsite, and the artifact scatter dated from the Late Archaic; the
scatter also possessed a Late Prehistoric component. The cultural affiliation of the remaining three
sites was unknown.
Stephenson (1970) described Site 41HI32 as a rock shelter at the upper end of a ravine. Although the
site appeared to have a deep floor deposit at the time of his investigation, he was not able to test the
site as time did not allow for excavation. As a result, no artifacts were recovered from the site.
Site 41HI33, the Steele Site, also was identified by Stephenson (1970). Unlike Site 41HI32,
Stephenson was able to conduct a surface collection and excavate large portions of Site 41HI33, and
cultural materials were identified to depths of 457 cm (180 in). However, the majority of the recovered
613 artifacts were recovered from the upper 15 cm (6 in) of the site, and they consisted primarily of
chipped stone tools. Stephenson concluded that the occupants of the site were representative of a
single culture complex who occupied the site briefly over a period of several centuries. He attributed
the site to the Edwards Plateau Aspect of the Archaic Period (Stephenson 1970).
In terms of the NRHP eligibility of the sites, Sites 41BQ90 and 41BQ290 were assessed as ineligible,
while Site 41HI33 was assessed as eligible. The NRHP eligibility of the remaining four sites appears
to have not been assessed. While none of the previously recorded sites were located in the currently
proposed Project areas, Site 41BQ91 is located near the proposed river crossing. However, because
the HDD will occur in existing, disturbed right-of-way, the Project will not impact the site.

3.1.3 Previously Recorded Cemeteries
One cemetery was identified within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the proposed Project items. Kopperl Cemetery
is located within the city limits of Kopperl. Aerial photography shows it to be a landscaped cemetery
with a definitive, fenced boundary. Findagrave.com indicates that the cemetery possesses 1,130
interments. The earliest recorded interment dates from 1882, and the latest dates from 2015
(Findagrave.com 2019).

3.1.4 Standing Structures Greater than 50 Years in Age
No standing structures greater than 50 years in age were identified within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the
proposed Project items.

3.1.5 Properties Listed In the National Register of Historic Places
No properties listed in the NRHP were identified within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the proposed Project items.

3.2

Phase I Cultural Resources Survey Field Methodology

The objective of this cultural resources investigation was to identify any cultural resources within the
area of disturbance associated with the Project, define their horizontal and vertical boundaries, and
make assessments of the significance of any identified resources applying the NRHP Criteria for
Evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). Fieldwork included pedestrian survey, supplemented by systematic
shovel testing along all workspace locations situated outside the extant pipeline corridor. Because the
HDD will occur in a previously disturbed utility corridor, no subsurface testing was conducted for that
Project item.
All exposed ground surfaces were examined for evidence of archaeological resources. Current
construction plans call for subsurface impacts outside the existing corridor to measure no more than
91 cm (36 in) in depth. Thus, shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 100 cm (39.4 in). Additionally,
in those areas surveyed previously by Turner (2015), no additional subsurface testing was conducted.
Each shovel test measured 30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter and each was excavated in 10 cm (3.9 in)
levels. All excavated soil was screened through 0.64 cm (0.25 in) hardware mesh. The location, depth,
soil strata, and presence/absence of cultural materials was recorded for each shovel test, and all
shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. Shovel tests were mapped in the field using a handheld
Global Positioning System (GPS) unit. All work was supervised by cultural resources professionals
who meet the United States Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for
Archaeology and Historic Preservation.

Architectural Field Methods

As a part of this Phase I cultural resources investigation, all visible historic standing structures,
cemeteries, or engineering structures located within or immediately adjacent to the proposed Project
area that appeared to have been built at least 50 years ago were to be examined at the reconnaissance
level. However, no such structures were identified.

Results

This chapter describes the results of Phase I cultural resources investigation of the proposed Energy
Transfer Partners Brazos River Horizontal Directional Drill location associated with the proposed J.C.
Nolan Pipeline Project in Bosque and Hill counties, Texas (Figures 1.1, 1.2, and 4.1). The proposed
project items were located on both sides of the Brazos River (Figure 4.1). On the west side of the river,
the workspace associated with the project measured approximately 2.6 ha (6.4 ac), while the
workspace on the east side of the river measured approximately 0.4 ha (1.0 ac). Two arbitrary survey
segments, one located on either side of the river, were utilized to examine the proposed project items.
A description of each survey segment is below.

4.1

Survey Segment SS-PEH04232019a

Survey Segment SS-PEH042319a was located on the west side of the Brazos River in Bosque County
(Figures 4.1 and 4.2). The segment measured approximately 50 m (98.4 ft) in width and it extended
approximately 900 m (2,952.8 ft). The segment originated in a field east of Farm-to-Market Road 56,
and it terminated at the previously surveyed pipeline corridor. Vegetation along the survey segment
consisted of grasses interspersed with copses of mixed hardwood trees (Figure 4.3). Observed slopes
along the segment were characterized as nearly level to gently sloping.
A total of 18 shovel tests were excavated in Survey Segment SS-PEH042319a at 50 m (164 ft)
intervals along a single survey transect. Shovel testing was not conducted in areas where existing
safety hazards, such as buried pipelines, prevented safe excavation. In such cases, attempts were
made to offset the shovel test. Shovel test profiles for each excavated shovel test can be found in
Appendix I.
A typical shovel test excavated in the segment extended to a depth of 100 cm (39.4 in) and it exhibited
two strata in profile. Stratum I, a dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay, extended from the ground surface
to a depth of 45 cmbs (17.7 inbs). Stratum II, a brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay with calcium carbonate
nodules, extended from the base of Stratum I to a depth of 100 cmbs (39.4 inbs). No cultural resources
or evidence of intact cultural deposits were identified in survey segment SS-PEH042319a. No
additional investigation of this Project item is recommended.

4.2

Survey Segment SA-PEH042519a

Survey Segment SA-PEH042519a was located on the east side of the Brazos River in Hill County
(Figures 4.1 and 4.4). The survey measured approximately 61 by 61 m (200 by 200 ft), and it was
crossed by multiple pipeline corridors. The gently sloping workspace was covered primarily by
manicured lawn, although occasional mixed woods also were present (Figure 4.5).
A total of four shovel tests were excavated in the segment at 50 m (98.4 ft) intervals along two survey
transects located to either side of the proposed workspace centerline. The two transects were initially
spaced 50 m (98.4 ft) apart. However, due to the presence of the extant pipelines, the transect spacing
was increased to 60 m (197 ft) to allow for sufficiently safe distance from the active pipeline corridors.
A typical shovel test excavated within Survey Segment SA-PEH042519a extended to a variable depth
of 10 to 68 cmbs (3.9 to 26.8 inbs) before terminating on a layer of solid rock. Each test exhibited a
single stratum in profile, a very dark gray (10YR 3/1 or 7.5YR 3/1) clay loam that extended from the
surface to the base of excavations. No cultural resources or evidence of intact cultural deposits were
identified in Survey Segment SA-PEH042519a. No additional investigation of this Project item is
recommended.

Chapter 5. Summary and Recommendations

Summary and Recommendations

The Phase I cultural resources investigation of the proposed Energy Transfer Partners Brazos River
Horizontal Directional Drill Project examined an area measuring approximately 2.9 ha (7.2 ac) in total
extent. Pedestrian survey, augmented by the excavation of 22 shovel tests, failed to reveal the
presence of any surface or subsurface cultural materials. Likewise, no potentially intact cultural soils
were observed. Finally, no historic built resources were identified as a result of this survey.
Consequently, AECOM recommends a finding of no historic properties affected and further
recommends no further investigations be conducted.
If any unmarked prehistoric or historic human remains or burials are encountered, the area of the
remains is considered a cemetery under current Texas law. All cemeteries are protected under State
law and cannot be disturbed. Section 28.03(f) of the Texas Penal Code provides that intentional
damage or destruction inflicted on a human burial site is a state jail felony. If a cemetery is identified
in the project right-of-way, all work in the area of the discovery must cease and the THC must be
notified by contacting the History Programs Division at (512) 463-5853 and the Archeology Division at
(512) 463-6096. Following consultation with the THC, a treatment or avoidance plan would be
developed and implemented.

Scope of Work
This Scope of Work describes the methodologies and technical approach for the Phase I cultural resources
survey of the proposed Energy Transfer (ET) Brazos River Horizontal Directional Drill (HDD) location
associated with the proposed J.C. Nolan Pipeline Project (Project) in Bosque and Hill counties, Texas
(Figure 1). ET has conducted bathymetric surveys of the existing pipeline crossing of the Brazos River
(Lake Whitney) and is considering proactive measures to lower the pipeline. If it is determined to lower the
pipeline beneath the Brazos River, the Project will consist of using HDD technology to drill a
30.5-centimeter (cm; 12-inch [in]) pipeline approximately 9.2 meters (m; 30.3 feet [ft]) below the river.
AECOM Technical Services, Inc. (AECOM), on behalf of ET, will conduct the archaeological and
architectural inventories of the proposed Project components described above. This investigation is
designed to identify and evaluate any cultural resources, such as historic and prehistoric archaeological
sites, historic standing structures, and cemeteries, which may be located within the area of disturbance
associated with the Project. This investigation will follow the guidelines and procedures outlined in the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended; the Archaeological and Historic
Preservation Act of 1974; 33 CFR 325 Appendix C - Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties;
and, Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and 800, as appropriate. Additionally, this
survey effort will abide by the standards set forth in Archeology and Historic Preservation: The Secretary
of the Interior’s Guidelines and with guidelines contained within Preservation Connection: Texas’
Statewide Historic Preservation Plan. 2011–2020. Information provided by the Council of Texas
Archeologists, the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, the Antiquities Code of Texas, and the
Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Archeological Survey Standards For Texas and Rules of Practice
and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas also will be utilized.
As currently proposed, the crossing will span approximately 1,681.3 m (5,516 ft). In addition, the pipeline
replacement will occur in ET’s existing, disturbed pipeline corridor. However, additional temporary
workspace will be required for pipe stringing, contractor parking, and laydown. Such workspace will be
located outside the existing, disturbed corridor. Further, at this time ET has not yet determined from which
side of the river they will cross. As a result, ET is examining workspace locations on both sides of the
Brazos River (Figures 1 and 2).
The Project spans a portion of the Brazos River that lies within the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps of Morgan, TX and Lakeside Village, TX. Any impacts the
Project may have on wetlands and water bodies will be permitted by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) related to actions under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. §1251
et seq.) and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403). Therefore, because this is a
federal undertaking, this Project is subject to review under Section 106 of the NHPA (16 USC 470) and its
implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).

NATURAL SETTINGS
The regional landscape strongly influences the preservation and subsequent identification of any archeological
materials that may have been deposited within the proposed Project areas. The Project items are located within
the eastern Grand Prairie physiographic region, which developed on limestones and calcareous shales (Bureau
of Economic Geology 1996). The Project area is underlain by the Cretaceous-era Fredericksburg and L.
Washita geologic groups (Bureau of Economic Geology 1992). The area is adapted primarily to agriculture,
particularly raising livestock and growing staple crops, and it is generally treeless except along the
streambanks (Texas Almanac 2018). The area is characterized by thin, rocky soils arising from weathering

and erosion. The eastern Grand Prairie Region is typified by plains ranging in elevation from 381 to 137 m
above sea level (asl; [1250 to 450 ft asl]); a strata dip characterizes the eastern side of the Region (BEG 1996;
United States Department of Agriculture [USDA] 2008).
Due to the Project area’s proximity to the Brazos River and the peculiarities of the Fredricksburg group there,
soils within the Project are generally deeper and less eroded than those in much of the Grand Prairie Region
(Brooks 1978). Soils on the west side of the river are comprised from the Bastrop, Minwells, Slidell, and
Sunev series. All are characterized as deep, well-drained soils. Slidell soils are found on uplands, and Bastrop,
Minwells, and Sunev soils are found on stream terraces. Bastrop soils are loamy and sandy and are formed in
thick beds of loamy alluvial sediments. Minwells soils are loamy and are formed in thick beds of loamy and
gravelly alluvial sediments. Sunev soils are loamy and are formed in alluvium along major streams (Stringer
1980).
Soils on the east side of the river are comprised from the Aledo, Bastsil, Brackett, Burleson, Gowen, and
Krum series. Aledo and Brackett soils are shallow, loamy soils. Aledo soils are underlain by hard, coarsely
fractured limestone at a depth of less than 50.8 cm (20 in). Brackett soils are formed in interbedded soft
limestone and marly earth. Bastsil soils are deep, sandy or loamy soils found on uplands and formed in loamy
sediments on stream terraces. Burleson soils are deep, nearly level, clayey soils found on old stream terraces.
They are formed in alkaline, clayey sediments. Gowen soils are deep, loamy soils and are formed in
noncalcareous loamy sediments in floodplains. Krum soils are deep, clayey soils that formed in thick beds of
unconsolidated, calcareous sediments on old high terraces and valley fills (Brooks 1978).

CULTURAL SETTING
The Project area falls within the Prairie-Savanna study region of the Eastern Archaeological Planning
Region as defined by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Researchers have divided the region into
chronological periods based on archaeological evidence obtained from investigations principally related to
grant-funded reconnaissance (primarily carried out by the University of Texas), reservoir construction,
mining operations, Soil Conservation Service projects, water treatment, utility and energy line construction,
and federally-funded highway projects. Table 1 depicts the chronological periods for the Project area. A
brief overview of each period is below.

The Paleoindian period is the earliest defined cultural period in North America. Most of the evidence of the
period in the region consists of isolated finds of projectile points; generally, the point types are non-local
and are made of non-local materials. There is usually meager occupational debris, and, while some bison
remains have been identified, much of the faunal remains are from small mammals and land turtles. Overall,

archaeological evidence suggests that small, highly mobile groups inhabited or passed through the region
during the Paleoindian period (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
Although sites from this period within the study region are extremely rare, a Paleoindian component was
identified at Site 41BQ46, the Horn Shelter No. 2 Site, which is a rock shelter located approximately 32 km
(20 mi) south of the proposed project area (Bousman, et al. 2004). A number of sealed Paleoindian deposits
were identified within the site, and diagnostic artifact recoveries included Folsom, San Patrice, and
Scottsbluff projectile points, as well as a possible Clovis point. Radiocarbon dates for these deposits ranged
from 9500 +/- 200 B.P. to 10,310 +/- 150 B.P. (Bousman, et al. 2004).
In addition, a double burial consisting of a Paleoindian adult and child was identified at Site 41BQ46. Both
skeletons were nearly complete, and numerous grave goods, such as shell beads, bird claws, bone and stone
tools, and perforated nonhuman canines also were identified in association with the bodies. The cranium of
the adult was placed in a turtle carapace, and two other turtle carapaces were placed near the face and pelvis
of the body. Both individuals were characterized as male, and the adult was estimated to be between 160167.6 cm (63-66 in) in height (Bousman, et al. 2004).
Near the end of the Paleoindian period, global climate began to change slowly, becoming gradually warmer
and dryer (Brown and Lebo 1991). In response, plant and animal populations also changed and the human
populations in north Texas began to exploit a wider variety of food resources. Archaeological evidence of
Early and Middle Archaic groups within the Prairie-Savannah study region is sparse. Artifacts from the
Early and Middle Archaic periods are restricted to projectile points and they often come from culturallymixed soil deposits or from surface finds. Projectile points from the Early and Middle Archaic are usually
less carefully fashioned and are made from less exotic materials than those from the Paleoindian Period
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
In comparison to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased population and site
density. Artifacts from the Late Archaic period are characterized by projectile points made of local materials
and an increased density of occupational debris and features, such as hearths and floral remains. Burned
rock midden features dating from the latter part of the Middle Archaic and the Late Archaic periods, absent
in most of the study region, have been identified in Bosque County (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
The Late Prehistoric periods are marked by the introduction of bow-and-arrow technology, ceramics, house
structures, and corn horticulture. Changes in ceramic and arrow point types distinguish the Late Prehistoric
I from the Late Prehistoric II period. Additionally, archeological evidence shows a more varied assemblage
during Late Prehistoric II, including thumbnail scrapers, knives, drills, digging sticks, and hoes (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993).
The Historic Indian period generally coincided with the arrival of the first Spanish and French peoples in
the region. Archaeological sites from the period are extremely rare in the Prairie-Savannah study region;
all sites identified thus far are village sites associated with the Wichita Confederacy, a group that moved
from the Oklahoma-Kansas border region into northern Texas in the mid-1700s. Many of the sites are
heavily damaged; however, the Vinson Site (Limestone County) remains largely intact. Archaeological
excavation there revealed eight burned house floors and a mixture of European trade goods, such as beads,
metal arrowpoints, and gun parts; and native-made items, such as ceramics, hide scrapers, and ground stone
tools. Documentary evidence from early European explorers in the region lists several groups, including
the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai (Kichai), Yojaunce, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

The Stansbury Site, Site 41HI9, was an Historic Indian village site that is located in close proximity to the
Project area. Stephenson (1970) hypothesized that the Stansbury Site represents the former location of the
Flechado Village of the Tawkoni Indians. The Tawkoni were closely related to the Wichitas, and the village
was established between 1772 and 1778, and abandoned between 1780 and 1786. Stephenson described the
site as a, “large, open, occupation area on the edge of the upper, or 40-foot, terrace of the Brazos River…two
miles above the Whitney Dam” (Stephenson 1970:104). Investigations conducted at the site in 1947 and
1950 identified, “four burials, a stone wall, several “piles” of bison bones, a series of unpatterned postholes,
and an aboriginal dwelling structure” (Stephenson 1970:104). The artifact sub-assemblage recovered from
the site included both Native American and European/American trade goods. In addition to the Tawkoni
occupation, the site likely was reoccupied in the middle nineteenth century by a Hainai Native American
group. At that time, the site was referred to as the Old Towash Village. These groups likely were relocated
to Oklahoma Territory in 1870 (Stephenson 1970).
The first European explorers to enter what is now Bosque County were Spanish missionaries, who arrived
in 1721. In Hill County, the first European was probably Pedro Vial, a Frenchman hired by the Spanish to
find a route to Santa Fe from San Antonio, in 1786 (Austin 2016; Strickland 2018). Before Texas
independence, while under the control of Mexico, several empresario grants were awarded by Mexico to
populate the territory (Haaser 2010; Hardy, et al. nd). Settlement in both Bosque and Hill Counties began
with these land grants. In Bosque County, the first settler was Sterling C. Robertson; in Hill County, the
first settler was Peter Fleming. Both men were issued grants in 1825. Within a few years, Robertson also
received much of the land that would become Hill County and, in 1835, he gave grants to several other
families that he recruited to settle the area. Few homesteaders opted to settle within Bosque County until
1841, when a military expedition passed through the region and many of those associated travelers decided
to stay. In 1847, the town of Kimball was established in Bosque County in an effort to bring more settlers
to the area. The first town in Hill County was established in 1849 and it surrounded Fort Graham. The fort
was abandoned in 1853, but the town remained (Austin 2016; Strickland 2018).
Hill County was created from a portion of Navarro County in 1853 and Bosque County was formed from a
portion of McLennan County in 1854. Hillsborough and Meridian were chosen as the respective county
seats, and in both counties, town lots were sold to the public for settlement. Many Norwegians settled in
the less-densely populated Bosque County following an offer by the state of Texas to grant 320 acres to
anyone willing to settle in the new county (Austin 2016; Strickland 2018).
Both counties voted for secession in the Civil War. However, while Hill County supported three cavalry
units and established home guards, most of the soldiers in Bosque County guarded the area from local
Native Americans. Both counties grew during the latter half of the nineteenth century. The population of
Bosque County was enumerated at 4,981 in 1870; 11,216 in 1880; and 17,390 in 1900. Similarly, Hill
County’s population was enumerated at 3,653 in 1860; 7,453 in 1870; and 41,355 in 1900. However,
population of both counties began to fall during the early twentieth century as declining farm prices
discouraged agriculture and as manufacturers left the area.
Erosion and drought conditions worsened the agricultural decline in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.
Manufacturing, primarily related to lumber, limestone, oilfield-tool manufacturing, and textiles, began to
increase in Bosque County during the 1940s and 1950s and grew substantially in the 1970s and 1980s.
Manufacturing decreased in Hill County over the same period, but employment opportunities in service
industries such as medical care and retail rose significantly. As of 2014, 17,780 people lived in Bosque
County and 34,848 lived in Hill County (Austin 2016; Strickland 2018).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND BACKGROUND RESEARCH
A review was undertaken of those previously completed cultural resources surveys, previously recorded
archeological sites, built resources greater than 50 years in age, cemeteries, historic markers, and properties
listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) situated within 1.6 kilometer (km) (1.0 mile [mi])
of the proposed Project. That review utilized the data stored electronically on the THC’s Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA). The results of the data collection are summarized below.
Previously Completed Cultural Resources Surveys
A total of seven previously completed cultural resources investigations were identified within 1.6 km (1.0
mi) of the proposed Project items, and very few data were present on the abstracts present on TASA (Figure
2; Table 2). Two of the surveys were sponsored by The Smithsonian Institution in 1947. These
investigations were conducted by Robert L. Stephenson during the Texas River Basin Surveys (RBS)
program. Jelks (2014) indicated that these salvage investigations were initiated in 1945, and they examined
over 40 reservoir projects and located and recorded approximately 1,600 archeological sites. Stephenson
discussed some of the sites he identified during his survey of the Whitney Basin in Volume 18 of the
Bulletin of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society (Stephenson 1947), a more robust
discussion of those investigations was included in Volume 41 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological
Survey (Stevenson 1970).
Although not recorded on TASA, archeologists associated with Southern Methodist University (SMU)
conducted additional investigations near the Project area in anticipation of an expansion to Lake Whitney
(Skinner and Gallagher 1974; Lynott 1978). Electronic copies of the SMU reports could not be identified,
and they also were not available from local archives. However, based on correspondence with the USACE,
Skinner and Gallager recorded 29 new sites, including Sites 41BQ90 and 41BQ91 (see below; Daniel
McGregor, personal communication, 2019)
Of the remaining surveys, two were sponsored by the USACE, Fort Worth District, and they were Section
110 compliance efforts completed by Ecological Communications Corporation in 2008 and 2009 (Nickels,
et al. 2008; Jones, et al. 2009). Both were large-scale surveys that examined properties near Lake Whitney.
When combined, the investigations identified 15 new archeological sites and revisited three others. Of those
sites, Sites 41BQ90, 41BQ290, and 41HI33 were located near the proposed Project areas. While the study
authors recommended no additional work for Sites 41BQ90 and 41BQ290, Site 41HI33 was assessed as
eligible for listing on the NRHP, and avoidance was recommended.
Fieldwork for the final investigation was completed in 2015 by Turpin and Sons, Inc. (Turner 2015). While
the report does not appear on TASA, a copy was provided to AECOM by Mr. Daniel McGregor of the
USACE, Fort Worth District. The survey, which utilized pedestrian survey and shovel testing to assess
large portions of the currently proposed Project areas, did not identify any cultural resources.

Previously Identified Archeological Sites
Seven archeological sites were identified near the proposed Project items (Table 3). As mentioned above,
Stephenson (1947) identified four sites, which included 41HI26, 41HI27, 41HI32, and 41HI33. Site
41BQU90 was identified by Hyatt in 1972 and was revisited by Jones, et al. in 2009, who also recorded
Site 41BQ290. The examined site form for the final site, Site 41BQ91, indicates that it was identified by
Skinner in 1971.
Only Site 41BQ290 was characterized as an historic site. The site was described as late nineteenth to early
twentieth century homestead. It was assessed as not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
The six remaining sites were characterized on TASA as prehistoric, and they included three middens
(41BQ91, 41HI26, 41HI27), a rock shelter (41HI32), a campsite (41BQ90), and an artifact scatter (41HI33).
One of the middens, the campsite, and the artifact scatter dated from the Late Archaic; the scatter also
possessed a Late Prehistoric component. The cultural affiliation of the remaining three sites was unknown.
Stephenson (1970) described Site 41HI32 as rock shelter at the upper end of a ravine. Although the site
appeared to have a deep floor deposit at the time of his investigation, he was not able to test the site as time
did not allow for excavation. As a result, no artifacts were recovered from the site.
Site 41HI33, the Steele Site, also was identified by Stephenson (1970). Unlike Site 41HI32, Stephenson
was able to conduct a surface collection and excavate large portions of Site 41HI33, and cultural materials
were identified to depths of 457 cm (180 in). However, the majority of the recovered 613 artifacts were
recovered from the upper 15 cm (6 in) of the site, and they consisted primarily of chipped stone tools.
Stephenson concluded that the occupants of the site were representative of a single culture complex who
occupied the site briefly over a period of several centuries. He attributed the site to the Edwards Plateau
Aspect of the Archaic Period (Stephenson 1970).
In terms of the NRHP eligibility of the sites, Sites 41BQ90 and 41BQ290 were assessed as ineligible, while
Site 41HI33 was assessed as eligible. The NRHP eligibility of the remaining four sites appears to have not
been assessed. While none of the previously recorded sites were located in the currently proposed Project
areas, Site 41BQ91 is located near the proposed river crossing. However, because the HDD will occur in
existing, disturbed right-of-way, the Project will not impact the site.

Previously Recorded Cemeteries
One cemetery was identified within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the proposed Project items. Kopperl Cemetery is
located within the city limits of Kopperl. Aerial photography shows it to be a landscaped cemetery with a
definitive, fenced boundary. Findagrave.com indicates that the cemetery possesses 1,130 interments. The
earliest recorded interment dates from 1882, and the latest dates from 2015 (Findagrave.com 2019).
Standing Structures Greater than 50 Years in Age
No standing structures greater than 50 years in age were identified within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the proposed
Project items.
Properties Listed In the National Register of Historic Places
No properties listed in the NRHP were identified within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the proposed Project items.

PHASE I CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY FIELD METHODOLOGY
The objective of this cultural resources investigation is to identify and inventory any cultural resources
within the area of disturbance associated with the Project, define their horizontal and vertical boundaries,
and make assessments of the significance of any identified resources applying the NRHP Criteria for
Evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). Fieldwork will include pedestrian survey of each Project item,
supplemented by systematic shovel testing along all workspace locations situated outside the extant pipeline
corridor. Because the HDD will occur in a previously disturbed utility corridor, no subsurface testing will
be conducted for that Project item.
All exposed ground surfaces will be examined for evidence of archaeological resources. Current
construction plans call for subsurface impacts outside the existing corridor to measure no more than 91 cm
(36 in) in depth. Thus, shovel tests will be excavated to a depth of 100 cm (39.4 in). Additionally, in those
areas surveyed previously by Turner (2015), no additional subsurface testing will be conducted.
Each shovel test will measure 30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter and will be excavated in 10 cm (3.9 in) levels.
All excavated soil will be screened through 0.64 cm (0.25 in) hardware mesh. The location, depth, soil
strata, and presence/absence of cultural materials will be recorded for each shovel test, and all shovel tests

will be backfilled upon completion. Shovel tests will be mapped in the field using a handheld Global
Positioning System (GPS) unit. All work will be supervised by cultural resources professionals who meet
the United States Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for Archaeology and
Historic Preservation.

SITE RECORDATION AND DELINEATION
Any cultural resources identified during survey will be examined to ascertain their nature, size, depth,
integrity, age, and affiliation. Delineation also will be used to assess stratigraphic placement, artifact
density, and the research potential of each identified site. In addition, information will be gathered to assist
in subsequent assessment of whether a site is significant applying the NRHP Criteria for Evaluation (36
CFR 60.4 [a-d]). Archeological recordation will include a combination of the following tasks: (1)
establishment of a site datum; (2) intensive surface reconnaissance of the site area; and (3) excavation of
tightly spaced shovel tests at 10-m (32.8-ft) intervals along rays emanating from datum to delineate both
the horizontal and vertical extent of the site and its configuration. A minimum of six delineation tests will
be excavated to determine site boundaries; if necessary, the shovel test spacing will be reduced accordingly.
Artifact distributions and the stratigraphic positions of all artifacts will be used in compiling each site
description, as well as to support a clear and concise statement regarding integrity and significance for each
identified site. Finally, Texas Archeological Site Data Forms will be completed for all sites identified and
delineated during survey.

ARCHITECTURAL FIELD METHODS
As a part of this Phase I cultural resources investigation, all visible historic standing structures, cemeteries,
or engineering structures located within or immediately adjacent to the proposed Project area that appear to
have been built at least 50 years ago will be examined at the reconnaissance level. This effort will collect
reconnaissance-level architectural survey data for any historic buildings located within or adjacent to the
Project corridor and it will determine if additional research or recordation is necessary.

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
Laboratory analysis of all recovered cultural materials will follow established archeological protocols. All
field specimen bag proveniences first will be crosschecked against the field notes and the specimens
inventoried for accuracy and completeness. Following this quality-control process, all recovered materials
will be washed by hand, air-dried, sorted into basic material categories, and then encoded into computerized
site catalogs to allow manipulation of the data. The nature and structure of the analyses will be guided by
the Project goals. The first requirement of the research will be to determine whether a cultural resources
locus has the potential to meet the legal definition of a historic property (i.e., eligible for listing in the
NRHP). Therefore, care will be taken to observe and record chronologically sensitive attributes of historic
artifacts, and to evaluate whether the material is more than 50 years in age.
Beyond the determination of minimum age, the artifact analysis will consist of making and recording a
series of observations for each specimen. The observations will be chosen to provide the most significant
and diagnostic information about each specimen. Separate relational databases will be used to store,
organize, and manipulate the data generated by the analytical process. Separate databases will be used for
analyzing the prehistoric lithics, prehistoric ceramics, and historic artifacts recovered during survey. If
needed, additional databases will be used for the analysis of any faunal or botanical remains, as well as any
other classes of recovered data that may be collected. The use of these databases will reflect differences in
the analytical protocols required to study thoroughly the different types of materials. Non-diagnostic artifact

descriptions will be summarized in tabular form. Photographs and descriptions of chronologically or
culturally diagnostic artifacts will be included in the report. Features or artifacts observed but not collected
also will be described in the report.

CULTURAL RESOURCES ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING
Based on field and laboratory data, a recommendation of significance will be offered for all newly recorded
archeological sites and/or historic standing structures identified as a result of this intensive cultural
resources survey. These assessments will apply the NRHP Criteria for Evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]).
Following survey, a draft report will be written that presents the background, methods, and results of this
investigation and it will contain appendices that will include an inventory of recovered cultural materials
and Project correspondence with review agencies.

CURATION
After the final report has been accepted, all cultural materials not returned to individual landowners,
drawings, maps, photographs, and field notes will be curated with the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, J.J. Pickle Research Campus, Bldg. 5, The University of Texas at Austin, 10100 Burnet Road,
Austin, Texas 78758.
