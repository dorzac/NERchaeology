Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a field survey of six creek and river
crossings along the proposed Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline right-of-way. The pipeline is to be
installed by TexStar through Live Oak and McMullen counties, Texas. The project was entirely
privately funded, and the properties across which the pipeline will cross are privately owned;
therefore, no Texas Antiquities Permit was required.
The crossings were examined by two archaeologists on September 21, 2011, resulting in the
discovery of two prehistoric open campsites (451LK329 and 41LK331) and one small historic
house site (41LK330). Only 41LK329 is assessed as potentially significant and recommended
for avoidance. 41LK330 and 41LK331 are assessed as possessing little potential to contribute
to the prehistory or history of Texas. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the pipeline be
allowed to be constructed through these two sites as planned. Tierras Antiguas further
recommends that if any additional, undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during
development along the entire pipeline right-of-way, such finds should be examined and evaluated
by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant. No artifacts were collected
during this project.

Acknowledgments
I express my sincere appreciation to Mr. David Black, Senior Project Manager at Flatrock
Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. David was extremely amiable and helpful throughout, and
his overall knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our understanding of the
project’s scope of work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologist Belisario Silva,
who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and work ethic that ensured this survey
was conducted in a thorough and professional manner.

Introduction
In August 2011, Tierras
Antiguas conducted a cultural
resources background review of
the 55-mile Choke Canyon Oil
Pipeline right-of-way (ROW)
through Live Oak and
McMullen counties (Figures 1
and 2). That review identified
the known archaeological sites
within 1,000 meters of the rightof-way, as well as the potential
for both prehistoric and historic
archaeological sites to exist
(Nickels 2011).
Based upon that review,
Flatrock Engineering then
requested a field survey of six
creek and river crossings of the
Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline that
were to be impacted by TexStar Figure 1. Location of the Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline project
in Texas.
Energy for the
construction of the
pipeline. The survey
was conducted by
Tierras Antiguas in
September 2011, and
hereinafter is sometimes
referred to as the Project
Area (PA).

Live Oak and McMullen
Counties are located in
south-central Texas (see
Figure 1). Their current
political boundaries

encompass 2,216 square miles. The generally flat to rolling terrain ranges in elevation from about
70-450 feet above mean sea level. Clayey and loamy soils support the growth of small
predominately mesquite trees, and thorny scrub brush with assorted cacti and grassy understory.
Although, pristine riverine vegetation along the many creeks and the Nueces River includes large
pecans and oaks.
With their semi-arid environment, the counties are generally frost-free from mid-February through
early December, allowing for about 290 growing season days. The average annual rainfall is about
28 inches, with most rainfall occurring in May and September. These peaks are the result of
thunderstorms bearing moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Pacific Ocean much
farther to the west (Leffler 2011a, b).
However, rainfall amounts vary significantly from year to year, and the high evapotranspiration
effects in the area effectively offset any beneficial surplus of annual rainfall. This is another
reason irrigation systems are so necessary, and commonly found in use today throughout the area.
Summers are indeed hot and dry, with temperatures consistently hovering above 1000F, although
humidity is generally low compared to environments closer to the Gulf Coast. Overall, the climate
can be classified as subtropical steppe.
Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande are the major southeasterly trending rivers draining the
South Texas region. A subtle divide through the northeastern portion of the counties causes
numerous intermittent creeks to flow north into the Nueces River, and numerous others of the
same type to drain southward into the Rio Grande. Many drainages intermittently flow into both
rivers during infrequent seasonal periods of abundant rainfall. Although there are many springs,
very few are active due primarily to the dip of the substrate shales which carry these subterranean
seeps to the south and east. As a result, some of these active seeps/springs can be found on the
Mexican side of the national border. Ancient springs that may have existed in the area at one time
have likely succumbed to overgrazing and irrigation pumping during modern times (Brune 1981).
During our investigation of the project area in September 2011, we observed a strong flow in the
Nueces River due to recent rains.
Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation area as defined by
Gould (1975), and the regional flora of South Texas has been classified as being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic province extending out from northeast Mexico (Figures 3 and 4). This is the
only part of Texas where some vegetation exhibits growth throughout the year (Blair 1950).
Thorny brush is the dominant vegetation today, but this is a relatively recent occurrence, with a
mix of woody and grassland species providing a savanna environment during prehistoric times
(Archer 1995; Black 1989; Hester 1980; Inglis 1964). The original vegetation was an open
grassland mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and ash were common along perennial
streams. Due in part to overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the invasion of woody species has

2

changed the vegetation into “Texas brush
country” dominated by mesquite, acacia,
spiny hackberry, brazil, whitebrush,
lotebrush, and others (Diamond et al.
1987:203-221). On sandy soils, the brush
includes mesquite with mixed grasses. In
contrast, clay soils support mesquite
(Proposis juliflora), various species of
Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or desert
hackberry (Celtis pallida), lignum vitae
(Porliera angustifolia), cenizo
(Leucophyllum texanum), white brush
(Aloysia texana), prickly pear (Opuntia
lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia
leptocaulis), and species of Condalia and
Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country
exhibits some of the greatest mammalian
species diversity in the state. Sixty-one
species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19
lizards, and several species of turtles,
salamanders, and frogs are present in the Figure 3. Physiographic regions of Texas
region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50 (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg).
species of fish have been identified in the
lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of Texas is as
varied as the landscape, and the South
Texas Paleoclimatic record contains
significant gaps primarily due to the
scarcity of deep, finely stratified, and
well-dated deposits (Stahle and
Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best
record of pal eoenvironmen t al
reconstruction in South Texas has been
accomplished by Robinson (1982) from
analysis of phytoliths from three
archaeological sites in Live Oak County.
Overall, the data there along with data

Figure 4. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.

from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or late-glacial period, marked
a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew warmer and drier, and
more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the rivers and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the present
time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline project lies within the South Texas Archaeological region as
defined by Hester (1980, 1995, 2004; Figure 5). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas
is problematic, due to the compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of
stratified sites excavated within the region. Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of
information that exists for south Texas and as such offers only a “general framework” for
prehistoric periods particular to the region (Figure 5). All dates are given as approximate years
before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of Clovistype points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been

4

placed on the wide diversity of
plants and animals used for
subsistence by these early
Americans, such as turtles and
tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers,
and raccoons, although they
undoubtedly hunted the large
animals as well (Collins
1995:381). Known Clovis sites
include killsites, quarries, caches,
open campsites, ritual sites, and
burials (Hester 1995:433–436).
A Folsom interval follows the
Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly
common in south Texas; however,
no camp sites or killsites have been
found south of a large workshop,
Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435).
Most Paleoindian finds in south
Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces
and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the
transition from Pleistocene to
Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric
inhabitants adapted with changes
in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and
extinction of mammoth, mastodon,
horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious
game animals were perhaps extinct
in Texas. Human hunters were
forced to concentrate on deer,
antelope, and other medium-size or
smaller game. Changes in the
subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the Figure 5. South Texas Archaeological region chronology.

beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was
necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as deer, fish,
and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock
cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups
were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including most
of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low during
the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few
constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization of a
wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as
well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population,
based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the
South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear
continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at
least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of
gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned
rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common
presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took
place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less
mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas
Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750
B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P, Some
researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while
others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Subsistence
is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence
6

base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries indicates that Late
Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “pre-ceramic” until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic
points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1993) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period during
the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is represented by
diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap the Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this marked a transition
period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and bison, and a
reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw 1985; Peter
1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites
were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted.
Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a nonstandard
manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the ones that best
7

suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core reduction and the
manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology is a continent-wide
phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were
rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
8

is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

Site Types to be Expected Along the Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Live Oak and McMullen counties are prehistoric open
campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure 3).
Some of these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may
have camped for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large
groups of people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning
to these same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found
at these large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks
representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that
results from making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal
remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and
snail shells. Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine
environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands
away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different
food source that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads
and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the
northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools
(Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.

9

Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expected along
the Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken
tools that were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones.
The general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open
campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time
( However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make
them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural
outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles.
Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two
flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the
quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they
‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior,
then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites
are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried
away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and
the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic
scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles
flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further
reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks
are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of
south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are
of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in the Live Oak and McMullen County
areas have been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries and Procurement Sites
Prehistoric quarries and procurement also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic
periods, but differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose
gravels, but at times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or
quartzites were not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’.
These types of sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally
do not present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to
pick up gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped
stone remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites,
as well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be
expected. Although a handful of prehistoric quarries or procurement sites have been recorded in
south Texas, they are rare.

10

Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
The documentation of burned rock middens is rare in Live Oak and McMullen counties. Burned
rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like
modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the
larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less
effective as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes
unusable, another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and
the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For
a full discussion of the formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in
Texas, see Leach and Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in south
Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both
upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, but the largest prehistoric cemetery
found in proximity to the Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline is 41LK28, in Live Oak County.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of permanent
structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the area was generally not considered
safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers then began
establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Leffler 2011a, b).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.
Live Oak County
Out of the 304 documented archaeological sites in Live Oak County, 213 have cultural remains
that indicate they were used in prehistory as open campsites, and they have been found in both
upland and stream terrace settings. Temporally diagnostic artifacts found at these sites further
indicate that Live Oak County was occupied from the Paleoindian through Historic periods. There
are also 70 lithic scatters documented in the county, and once again the diagnostics found at these
sites indicate that the landscape was widely exploited from the Paleoindian through Historic
periods. A unique site that is not often documented in south Texas is the existence of a vertical
alignment of stone slabs that in other regions of Texas are remnants of prehistoric structures (e.g.,
Lintz 1984). Prehistoric burials have also been documented. A single prehistoric burial discovered
11

at one site had a bone awl in the cranium area of the skeleton, and Archaic dart points were found
in direct association. Perhaps the best documented prehistoric cemetery in south Texas is the
Loma Sandia Cemetery (41LK28), a State Archaeological Landmark burial ground (Taylor and
Highley 1995). Historic sites documented in the county include a single grave, houses and
outbuildings associated with 19th and 20th century farmsteads, a rock wall, trash dumps and
surface scatters, cattle dipping vats, and corrals. In addition Fort Merrill (41LK276), in use from
1850-1855 by the U.S. Army is listed as a State Archaeological Landmark.
McMullen County
There are 225 documented archaeological sites in McMullen County. Of those, 147 are
prehistoric open campsites with evidence that as a whole, open campsites in the county have been
occupied from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods. As with most of the region, many
campsites are situated on stream terraces, but there are also some in the uplands. Fifty-nine sites
are classified as lithic scatters, and generally these are located in the uplands and along stream
cutbanks where gravels outcrop. They also exhibit evidence of being used for the past 11,000
years. One quarry site has been recorded in the county, as has a single sandstone burned rock
midden. The only prehistoric burial noted was found at one of the open campsites. Historic sites
consist of local family cemeteries with just a few burials in each, house sites and farmsteads from
as early as the 1850s, and trash scatters.

Field Survey Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists were escorted to each of the crossings by representatives of
TexStar and Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. The right-of way was clearly marked
12

with wood survey stakes and flagging tape at all crossings. Tierras Antiguas archaeologists then
conducted a thorough pedestrian survey of each crossing, examining the surface on both sides of
each drainage, as well as all cutbanks. In addition, an evaluation was made of the potential for
buried cultural materials to exist if terraces were present. At the same time, consultation was
conducted with a Flatrock environmentalist, and a TexStar right–of-way agent onsite. These
consultations resulted in onsite decisions to either bore under the crossings, or to open-cut them.
The potential for buried and intact archaeological deposits to exist was very much an important
consideration in whether or not boring or open-cutting was appropriate. In those cases where
open-cutting was desired, Tierras Antiguas archaeologists either concurred, or conducted shovel
testing in order to further investigate the crossing. In those cases where boring was to be
conducted, Tierras Antiguas archaeologists identified a buffer zone along both sides of the
crossings that should not be impacted.
Where shovel testing was conducted, they were dug in 20-cm levels, and all sediments were
screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. All shovel test locations were documented with a hand-held
GPS. In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural materials of a redundant nature,
both prehistoric and historic, observed either on the surface or within shovel tests were not to be
collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via sketches, field photographs, and copious
notes, and their locations recorded with a hand-held GPS. Following that, they were to be returned
to the surface if surface finds, or to the top 10 cm of the shovel tests.
Exceptions were diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be considered as
significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian
transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and
that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist.
Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences within the ROW were to be
documented as archaeological sites. In addition, any potentially historic buildings 45 years or
older that were located adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and
included in the report of investigations.
Sites were to be mapped using a pace-and-compass method, as well as a GPS. Field notes were
to be made about each site and sketch maps were to be drawn. Representative artifacts on each
site were to be gathered and photographed.

Results of the Investigations
This section identifies the locations of the six crossings, and describes the levels of effort
expended at each of those crossings. No evidence of significant cultural material was found at five
of those crossings, and Tierras Antiguas concurred that open-cutting those crossings would have
no adverse impact. However, at one of those six crossings, Tierras Antiguas concurred with
Flatrock Engineering and TexStar representatives that boring was the appropriate method for
13

crossing these streams,
and thus avoiding any
adverse impact to both
known and potentially
intact cultural resources.
Crossing #1 - Drake

Description
Creek crossing #1 is

meters west-southwest of

slopes are steep and heavily eroded.

Drake Hollow; facing west.

The eastern slope is heavily gullied, exposing a carpet of chert gravels on the underlying caliche
(Figures 7 and 8).

Levels of Effort and Results
A thorough pedestrian examination of the heavily eroded east and west approaches of the
pipeline to Drake Hollow was conducted, and as shown in Figures 7 and 8, surface visibility was
excellent. An examination of the slopes within 30 meters of the center of Drake Hollow revealed
carpeted, predominantly fine-grained chert gravels, with occasional quartzite gravels lying on preHolocene caliche. Both cutbanks of the center of Drake Hollow were then examined to investigate
14

the geological profiles, as well as the stratigraphic positioning of any cultural materials that may
be present (Figure 9). As a result, no cultural materials were observed, and the geologic profile
suggested multiple episodes of very recent and rapid erosional colluvial deposition events . These
dynamic flooding and erosional episodes have deposited few chert gravels and cobbles in gray
clay, pale brown caliche and clay loam, overlain by grayish brown clay loam with fragmented and
angular sandstone bedrock (Figure 10).

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough surface examination of heavily eroded surfaces and recent erosional cutbanks of the
pipeline ROW as it crosses Drake Hollow revealed no cultural material, but significant erosion
that has likely occurred within the past 20 years. The erosion has exposed caliche on both
approaches to the center of Drake Hollow, and any cultural artifacts that may be present along this
portion of the pipeline are without doubt in secondary contexts. As such, their scientific value is
at best minimal, and Tierras Antiguas concurs that open cutting Drake Hollow as currently aligned
will have no adverse impact upon cultural resources.

Crossing #2 - Far Live Oak Creek
Description
Creek crossing #2 is located on the upper reaches of Far Live Oak Creek, approximately 1.8 miles
southwest of Franklin Ranch Road, and Creek Crossing #1 (Figure 11). At this point, the Choke
Canyon Oil Pipeline will parallel an already existing pipeline. As shown in Figure 12, this portion
of Far Live Oak Creek is merely an upland ephemeral drainage that continues to migrate a narrow
channel into the uplands with every fairly significant rainfall and rapid erosional runoff. As such,
no terrace deposits are present along any portion of the creek where the Choke Canyon Oil
Pipeline will cross the creek.

Crossing #1 (Figure 13).
As with Crossing #2, the

(Figure 14).

Levels of Effort and Results
A thorough pedestrian examination of
the cutbanks, and north and south
approaches of the pipeline to Live Oak
Creek was conducted. An examination
of 100 meters of the right-of-way on the
north side of the creek revealed heavily
incised and disturbed gullies leading
upslope, with few terrace remnants
remaining. The sloping surface also
revealed a continuos scatter of
predominantly fine-grained chert
gravels, with occasional quartzite
gravels. However, the south side

terrace deposits. An examination of the
cutbanks revealed probable Holocene deposits to a depth of 80 cm, overlying what appear to be
Pleistocene clays. No evidence of cultural material was observed either within the cutbanks or on
the surface during the pedestrian survey.

17

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
Although no cultural material was observed during a thorough surface examination of at least 100
m of the proposed pipeline alignment on both sides of Live Oak Creek, the terrace deposits along
both sides have the potential to contain buried and potentially significant cultural material.
Therefore, from an archaeological perspective, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the terrace
deposits be avoided during construction of the pipeline. It is our opinion that a setback of 40 m
on each side of the creek will be an adequate buffer zone to avoid disturbing any potentially intact
archaeological deposits. If they do exist, the archaeological deposits could be as deep as 90 cm
immediately adjacent to the creek, and progressively lessening in depth with distance from the
creek. If impact to the terrace deposits cannot be avoided, then Tierras Antiguas recommends a
systematic shovel testing program be conducted on both sides of the creek.

Crossing #4 - Atascosa River
Description
Crossing #4 is located on
the Atascosa River,
approximately 2.25 miles
north-northwest of Three
Rivers, in Live Oak
County (Figure 15). At
the proposed crossing,
cutbanks as much as 9-10
meters are exposed, with
terrace deposits along
both sides of the river
(Figures 16 and 17).
Obvious T-1 and T-2
terrace deposits are
present on the west side
of the river, but less
obvious on the subtle
outside meander along
the east side of the river.

Levels of Effort and Results
Following recent rains, the river was flowing during our visit to the west side of the river crossing
on September 21, 2011. As such only the west side of the river could be inspected. Although no
cultural material was observed, due to the dense leaf and litter cover, a thorough examination of
the surface could not be conducted. An examination of a 2-m cutbank along the west edge of the
river revealed no cultural material.
Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
The deep terrace deposits along both sides of the river suggest a high probability for potentially
significant cultural material to exist. Without deep testing of these terrace deposits on both sides
of the river, their existence and integrity is an unknown. Tierras Antiguas recommends that the
terrace deposits be avoided during construction of the pipeline by boring underneath them. If
impact to the terrace deposits cannot be avoided, then Tierras Antiguas recommends a systematic
shovel testing and backhoe trenching program be conducted on both sides of the creek. Without
archaeological testing, it is our opinion that a setback of 125 m on each side of the river will be
an adequate buffer zone to avoid disturbing any potentially intact archaeological deposits. If they
do exist, the archaeological deposits could be as deep as 3 m immediately adjacent to the creek,
and progressively lessening in depth with distance from the creek.

Crossing #5 - Sulphur
Creek
Description
Crossing #5 is located on
Sulphur Creek,
approximately .75 miles
north of Oakville, in Live
Oak County (Figure 19).
Downcutting along this
portion of Sulphur Creek
has exposed 2 to 3-m
cutbanks (Figure 20). The
west bank of the creek is
steeper, but obvious
terrace deposits exist on
the subtle outside
meander of the creek. On
the opposite, east side of
the creek the terrain
exhibits a more
pronounced slope, but
incremental terrace
deposits are also obvious.

Typical riverine vegetation consists of oak and elm trees, with sparse grasses and brushy
understory.

Levels of Effort and Results
A pedestrian survey within 100 m of
both sides of the creek was conducted.
Although no cultural material was
observed in the creek’s cutbanks, a
prehistoric open campsite was
documented on the west side of the
creek, and an historic small house site
was documented on the east side. Those
two sites (41LK329 and 41LK330) are
described below.

Figure 20. Sulphur Creek channel; facing south.
41LK329
Description
41LK329 (Figure 21) is a prehistoric
open campsite of an unknown age. It is
located on the west bank of a subtle
outside meander of Sulphur Creek. The
gently sloping, uppermost terrace has
been cultivated for farming, but with a
small motte of old oak trees still present.
Closer to Sulphur Creek, the terrain
slopes more steeply to the east (Figure
22). A barbed wire fence then parallels
the creek, giving way to incised gullies
with moderately thick vegetation
consisting of oak and mesquite trees,
with sparsely scattered and assorted
brushy understory, and native grasses.
Elevation at the site ranges from 140155 feet above mean sea level (amsl).
Surface visibility in September 2011
ranged from approximately 70 percent
amidst the brush and trees near the
creek, to 100 percent in the cultivated

field cleared for farming. Soils on the site consist of Sinton clay loam (StA, Stx), deep soils
commonly found along streams in Live Oak County (Web Soil Survey 2011).
Levels of Effort and Results
A full pedestrian surface survey along
150 meters of the proposed pipeline’s
westward approach to Sulphur Creek.
The surface distribution of artifacts
covers an area roughly 6,000 square
meters. Artifacts observed on the surface
included sparsely scattered fire-cracked
rocks, a core, and primary and secondary
chert flakes, amidst a moderate,
dispersed density of fine-grained chert
gravels (some with coarse-grained
inclusions) spread across the slope. No
diagnostics were observed that could Figure 22. West bank of Sulphur Creek at the eastern
place the site within a chronological edge of 41LK329 and the proposed Choke Canyon
timeframe.
Oil Pipeline crossing; facing southwest.
Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41LK329 appears to be an open campsite site in an optimum location along the west edge of
deeply cut Sulphur Creek. The upper terrace is gently sloping on well drained sandy loam.
Undoubtedly, water was flowing in Sulphur Creek at least seasonally over the past several
millenia, and the riverine vegetation offered a prime habitat for wild game. Mussel shell
fragments observed in the creek channel suggest that these may have also been exploited as a food
source in prehistoric times.
The vertical and horizontal extent of this open campsite is unknown without further
archaeological investigations. Tierras Antiguas recommends that the site be avoided during
construction of the Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline. The recommended avoidance would be boring
underneath the site. In that regard, a bore hole located 100 meters west of Sulphur Creek and
bored at an angle to a depth at the current elevation of the Sulphur Creek channel bottom is
deemed sufficient to avoid any cultural resources associated with the site. If the site cannot be
avoided, then Tierras Antiguas recommends Phase II testing be conducted prior to construction
of the pipeline.

41LK330
Description
41LK330 (Figures 23 and 24) is a small, one room historic structure that may have been occupied
periodically, or seasonally. It is located on a gently sloping, probable T2 terrace approximately
15 meters east of Sulphur Creek. Scattered mature oak and mesquite trees surround the site.
22

Closer to Sulphur Creek, the terrain slopes more steeply to the west. Elevation at the site ranges
from 150-152 feet above mean sea level (amsl).
Surface visibility in September 2011
ranged from approximately 80 to 100
percent. Soils on the site consist of Oden
fine sandy loam (OdA), deep, frequently
flooded soils commonly found along
streams in Live Oak County (Web Soil
Survey 2011).

Levels of Effort and Results
A full pedestrian surface survey along
150 meters of the proposed pipeline’s
eastward approach to Sulphur Creek.
The surface distribution of artifacts and
construction material is confined to a
small, roughly 100 square feet.
Construction material consisted of uncut,
natural limestone cobbles and very few
red, poorly fired bricks with no makers
marks. These were scattered in a cluster
with the artifacts. Artifacts observed
included an enameled tinware bowl, a
ferrous metal top to a probable 1-gallon
container, and a large whiteware
chamber pot sherd (Figure 25). Glass Figure 23. Site map, 41LK330.
artifacts included (1) a clear glass “ParT-Pak” soda water bottle with a red and
white painted label, double mold seams,
and with slight patina, (2) a 1-gallon
clear glass jug with no hue, and a screw
top, (3) a purple glass goblet base with
mold seams on both sides (Figure 26).

Figure 26. From left to right: Par-TPak soda water bottle, 1-gallon jug,

The clear glass bottles with modern machine molding and labeling technology indicates they were
manufactured after 1930. The purple glass goblet could have been manufactured before 1900, but
dinnerware goblets such as this one with its modern mold seams were commonly manufactured
well into the 20th century (Munsey 1970). “Par-T-Pak” cola was bottled by the Nehi Corporation
in the late 1930s (Kingsport Chero-Cola Bottling Company 2011).
Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41LK330 appears to be a very small structure that was occupied by probably no more than one
person periodically or seasonally during the period of about 1935 through perhaps 1950. It was
likely a one-room, board and batton lumber structure with concrete piers and wood beam
foundation. Based upon the small quantity and limited diversity of household artifacts, it is likely
that the structure was not occupied for any extensive length of time, and more than likely on a
temporary, periodic basis, possibly by itinerant migrants or a farmhand. An examination of 1925
and 1964 topographic maps reveals no structure in this area (Map 2011a, b).
Although interesting as an isolated piece of the historical occupation across the rural landscape
of Live Oak County in the 1930s and possibly through the 1950s, the structure and its use
possesses at best, minimal significance to the history of Texas. If any further investigations are
to be conducted, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the current and past landowners be
interviewed to determine the use of the structure. Otherwise, Tierras Antiguas recommends that
the Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline be allowed to be constructed as currently aligned, with no further
archaeological investigations.

Crossing #6 - Friday
Hollow
Description
Crossing #6 is located on
a first order tributary of
Friday Hollow,
approximately 1.6 miles
east of Oakville, in Live
Oak County (Figure 27).
The creek bottom at this
point is about 2 meters
below the modern
surface (Figure 28).

gullied, leaving isolated terrace deposits.
Typical riverine vegetation consists of
oak and elm trees, with sparse grasses
and brushy understory.
Levels of Effort and Results
A pedestrian survey within 100 m of
both sides of the creek was conducted.
Although no cultural material was
observed in the creek’s cutbanks, a
prehistoric open campsite (41LK331)
was documented on the west side of the
creek.

41LK331
Description
41LK331 (Figures 29
and 30) is a prehistoric
open campsite of an
unknown age. It is
located on the west bank
of a first order tributary
of Friday Hollow, an
upper, fi rst order
tributary of the Nueces
River. The construction
of an existing pipeline
has heavily disturbed the
site. However, because
the soils across the site

whose parent materials
are mine spoils or otherwise earthy fills
(Web Soil Survey 2011), the integrity of
the artifacts on the site even before
construction is questionable and
problematic. The upper portion of the
site has been cleared of vegetation along
the previously existing pipeline right-ofway. Otherwise, secondary growth of
mesquites, and thick understory suggest
a heavily disturbed area within the past
circa 20 years. Elevation at the site
ranges from 148-152 feet above mean
sea level (amsl). Surface visibility in
September 2011 ranged from
approximately 50 percent amidst the Figure 30. 41LK331 site shot; existing cleared

percent in the right-of-way.
Levels of Effort and Results
A full pedestrian survey of the creek’s west bank revealed one core and one flake on the surface.
An examination of the creek’s cutbanks revealed no evidence of cultural material. A single firecracked rock was then recoevered in the upper 5 cm of one of the two shovel tests excavated on
the site. The size of the site is roughly estimated at 300 square meters.

26

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41LK331 appears to be a small open campsite site in an optimum location along the west edge
of the creek. Water likely was flowing in the creek at least seasonally over the past several
millenia, and the riverine vegetation offered a prime habitat for wild game. However, in its current
condition, its integrity is problematic, and it is considered of little scientific research value.
Therefore, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline be allowed to be
installed in an open cut trench through the site as planned.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A pedestrian survey with limited shovel testing conducted at six creek and river crossings within
the proposed Choke Canyon Oil Pipeline right-of-way resulted in the discovery of two prehistoric
open campsites (451LK329 and 41LK331) and one small historic house site (41LK330). Only
41LK329 is assessed as potentially significant and recommended for avoidance. 41LK330 and
41LK331 are assessed as possessing little potential to contribute to the prehistory and history of
Texas. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the pipeline be allowed to be constructed
through these two sites as planned.
