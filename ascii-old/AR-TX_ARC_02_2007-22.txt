ABSTRACT
During the middle of June of 2007, AR Consultants, Inc.
conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
along Parvin Branch within the proposed Parvin Branch
development tract. The tract consists of approximately 125
acres and is located approximately 1.3 miles southwest of
Ponder in Collin County, Texas. The study area is bounded
by US 380 to the north, Dallas Parkway to the west, CR 26
to the south and Burlington Northern Railroad to the east.
The survey was done for KBA Envirosciences, LTD which
is doing the environmental permitting for Streets at Frisco
Winkelmann and Associates. No cultural materials older
than 50 years were seen on the ground surface or uncovered
during 24 shovel tests.
Based on the absence of archaeological sites, it is AR
Consultant’s recommendation that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted. If buried cultural materials
are encountered during construction, work should stop in
that area immediately and the Fort Worth District of the US
Army Corps of Engineers should be continued. Work
should not continue until consultations with the Corps of
Engineers have been concluded.

INTRODUCTION
During early June 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. shovel tested the banks of Parvin Branch as
part of an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed approximately 125
acre Parvin Branch Development Tract. The uplands adjacent to the drainage also were
investigated. The development tract is located south of and adjacent to US 380 and north
of and adjacent to County Road 26. The eastern boundary is the Burlington Northern
Railroad track and the western boundary is Dallas Parkway (Figure 1). The tract also is
located approximately 1.3 miles southwest of the town of Prosper in west central Collin
County, Texas. The archaeological survey was done for KBA Enviorsciences, LTD
which is doing the environmental permitting for Streets at Frisco Winkelmann and
Associates. Streets at Frisco Winkelmann and Associates intend to reroute most of Parvin
Branch as well as fill in the pond and intermittent tributaries to Parvin Branch and
conduct other developments to the area.
The survey was necessitated because Parvin Branch contains Waters of the United States.
The purpose of this survey was to locate any cultural resources and make
recommendations about their significance and how they might be impacted by
construction. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93291), Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural
Environment,” and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties
(36CFR800), Appendix C. Although this is a private company doing business with a
private land owner, the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission will act
as the Section 106 review agency.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural environment and cultural history of the study area. This is followed by a
description of the research design and the methodology used to carry it out. The results of
the investigation follow and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents
recommendations that arise from the study. A list of references cited concludes the
report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

Collin County lies in North Central Texas. It lies totally within the Blackland Prairie
region of Texas (Diamond, Riskind, and Orzell 1987: Figure 1). The prairie is dissected
by the East Fork of the Trinity River on the eastern edge of the county and then by
drainages that run basically from east to west east of Frisco which empty into the East
Fork or east to west from the Frisco area and drain into the Elm Fork. Narrow bands of
bottomland forest are confined to the drainages throughout the county (Minor 2003).
Soils in the study area are mapped as the Houston Black-Burleson association which
consists of nearly level to gently sloping clays on stream terraces (Hanson and Wheeler
1969: General Soils Map). Soils within the survey area are Houston Black clay with 0 to
1 and 1 to 3 percent slopes, Lewisville silty clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes and eroded
Lamar clay with 3 to 5 percent slopes. Parvin Branch is mapped as containing
occasionally flooded Trinity clay. (Hanson and Wheeler 1969:Sheet 38). The survey area
is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous-aged Austin Chalk which contains chalk
interbedded with calcareous clay (Bureau of Economic Geology 1991).
Parvin Branch is mapped as perennial on the USGS map but as intermittent on the Soil
Conservation Service Map for Collin County, Texas. The branch is a tributary to Panther
Creek.
As indicated above, Collin County is located in the Blackland Prairie vegetative area of
Texas (Gould 1975; Kuchler 1969: Region No. 68). Kuchler classifies the prairie as being
dominated by Andropogon-Sipa grasses, and Gould notes that little bluestem is the
climax dominant. Various other grasses are present as well. It is believed by Lynott
(1979) and others that the prairie was inhabited once by now absent herbivores including
bison and antelope. Certainly, deer inhabited the floodplain forests in the past, but that
environment is gone today.
Paleoenvironmental change is not well documented but it is summarized by Prikryl
(1993:192-193). Prior to 12,000 B.C., the climate of north central Texas was cooler and
moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 B.C., the climate became warmer and
this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. It is suggested that the
presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550 and1050 B.C. show
a drying with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 B.C. The later change is similar to the
environment of today. High grass pollen also occurs at approximately A.D. 450 and from
A.D. 1550 to 1650, thus also suggesting drier periods. The presence of paleosols between
A.D. 1 and 1,000 suggest an increase in moisture during this period with a return to drier
conditions after A.D. 1,000.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Over the past several decades, cultural resources investigations in north-central Texas
have varied due to the locations and types of projects carried out; therefore, the data base
of information to which new projects can be compared is limited. This is particularly true
for eastern Denton and Collin County which are located in the uplands of the Blackland
Prairie. The following culture history is derived from the monograph, “Lower Elm Fork
Prehistory”, by Daniel J. Prikryl (1990). Prikryl’s framework includes six prehistoric
periods, to which the historic Native American and European periods have been added.
Historic European
Historic Native American
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Late Archaic
Middle Archaic
Early Archaic
Paleoindian

A.D. 1800 to Present
A.D. 1600 to A.D. 1850
A.D. 1300 to 1600
A.D. 700 to A.D. 1300
2,000 B.C. to A.D. 700
4,000 B.C. to 2,000 B.C.
6,000 B.C. to 4,000 B.C.
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

The history of the Collin County region can be traced to as early as 8,000 to 9,000 B.C.
and since that time, it appears to have been continuously occupied (Crook N.D.). The
physical evidence of past occupation in the county has been termed "cultural resources,"
and many of these resources have been of such significance that they have been
recognized, recorded and in many cases preserved (RMA/Texas 1986).
Prehistoric Native American settlement in Collin County began at least 10,000 years ago
as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points. No very early
prehistoric sites have been recorded in the county but Paleoindian sites have been
reported from Denton County to the west in the valley of the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001; Prikryl 1990). Nevertheless, artifact
collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff and other Paleo-Indian
points from the surface of sites in the region (Meltzer and Bever 1995). The presence of
exotic, i.e., non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled a territory
where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw material
trading. These early people hunted now extinct large game but probably also foraged off
the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000 to 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700 to 800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the county but particularly along
the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods
(Lynott 1977). Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock and scrapers are common
artifacts found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making and using
exotic cherts for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local
lithics for chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels
(Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). Larger Archaic sites have been recorded and
tested at Lake Lavon (Dawson and Sullivan 1973) and these sites are generally located on
______________________________________________________________________________________

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY WITHIN THE PARVIN BRANCH DEVELOPMENT TRACT

6

terraces or ridges that overlook the East Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have
been recorded in upland areas throughout the county in conjunction with surveys of Soil
Conservation Service flood-water retarding dams and other projects (Lynott 1974;
Hughston and Lynott 1974; Peter 1990; Hunt, Peter and Allday 1991). These sites appear
to be Archaic in age but none have been thoroughly studied and their relationship to the
Lake Lavon sites is uncertain.
About A.D. 700 to 800, a major change is found in the artifacts and settlement patterning
of the prehistoric sites. Sites tend to congregate along the main stem of the East Fork of
the Trinity River. This is attributed to the drying up of the smaller tributaries. During this
period, which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East Texas appears
as trade material along with the indigenous Nocona Plain pottery. It has been suggested
that farming may have been practiced. Arrowheads appear about this same time and
apparently the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tools. The other interesting
thing is the appearance of large, circular pits constructed at sites along the East Fork and
its tributaries. No good explanation has been posed about the function of these features
although various authors have offered their interpretations (Stephenson 1952; Lynott
1975; Bruseth and Martin 1987).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the Collin County and the north central Texas area based on an absence
of sites with trade goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish or English
traders (Skinner 1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and
attempts to factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational
archaeologists who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region (Peter,
Cliff and Green 1996:2). There is very little evidence of historic era Native American
occupation anywhere in either county although historic accounts indicate that groups
were present in the early 1800's.
European settlement in the study area began by the mid-1800's with the establishment of
the Peter's Colony after Texas independence. Collin County was established in 1846 and
the county seat was at Buckner until 1848 when it was moved to McKinney. Settlement
has continued to the present. By the turn of the century, all of the major communities had
been established and some had passed away. The best summary of the history and
prehistory of Collin County, and adjacent Denton County, is the document, An Open
Space Plan for Collin County (RMA/Texas 1986).
Previous Investigations
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007), no archaeological sites are
listed within or adjacent to the study area. According to the 1930 Soil Map for Collin
County, Texas (Beck et al. 1930) no historic residences are present, but the 1936 General
Highway Map of Collin County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1936) shows
that two residences are present, one close to US 380 and the other close to County Road
26.

AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2006) conducted an archaeological survey of the Section 4 of
the Dallas North Tollway across US 380. Approximately 6.7 miles of the proposed road
route was examined, but only site, 41COL191, which consists of a historic farmstead,
was recorded.
Not exactly analogous, but the most investigated drainage in the area is Doe Branch, both
in Collin and Denton Counties. AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2004, 2005, 2006) and Todd
and Skinner (2002) have conducted archaeological surveys along the drainage and have
found no prehistoric sites although historic sites have been recorded when Doe Branch
was close to a roadway.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The purpose of this research design is to insure that fieldwork made a contribution to the
prehistory and history of Collin County, Texas. The following three research questions
were posed.
The first research question concerns the prehistoric occupation of the study area.
Based upon experience in the area, AR Consultants, Inc. felt that it was
unlikely that prehistoric sites would be present along Parvin Branch due to
the presence of seasonal water, low biotic diversity and absence of
knappable lithic resources.
The second question concerns the historic occupation of the study area.
It was predicted that historic sites were likely to be located along
roadways in well drained settings that were not farmed.
The third question guided the survey work in this survey as well as any archeological
survey done.
How did past people use the land, what record of this use did they leave
behind?
Methodology
Armed with the USGS map, soil map, shovels, a camera and field notes, the
archaeologists carefully inspected the ground surface within the study area. Both banks of
Parvin Branch were shovel tested and the uplands were investigated by variously oriented
transects spaced at irregular intervals. Shovel tests along Parvin Branch were excavated
at 100 m intervals to approximately 35 cm below the ground surface due to the degrading
environment and in the uplands adjacent to the drainage on a judgmental basis as
recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002). Shovel tests were not dug
in mechanically disturbed areas or where the ground visibility was 30 percent or more.
The clay matrices were manually broken and visually inspected for cultural resources as
were the pit walls. The archaeologists also made notes about the vegetation, soil and soil
exposure and took photographs.
Backhoe trenching was not done due to the fact that Parvin Branch does not have a well
developed floodplain in which cultural materials would be buried and preserved.

RESULTS
This portion of the chapter is broken into several parts. A description of the survey area is
provided and then followed by a discussion of the survey. Conclusions derived from the
survey end the chapter. Shovel tests are described generally in the text and specific
information is provided in Table 1 at the end of the chapter. Shovel test locations are
shown on Figure 4.
The study area
The study area consists of generally level terrain that slopes at about a 30 degree angle
when Parvin Branch is approached. Forested areas are present on both sides of the
drainage and divide the study area. The northern forested area ranges from approximately
60 to 100 m wide while the southern one ranges from 20 to 100 m wide. The southern
portion of the study area is planted in maize while the northern portion consists of a field
of corn intermixed with sunflowers. Trees within the forested area include bois d’arc,
elm, hackberry, mesquite, locust and eastern red cedar. Understory vegetation consists of
saw greenbriar, johnson grass, grama grasses, prickly pear, grape vine, blood weed and
other grasses and bushes. The typical vegetation is shown in Figure 2. Ground visibility
ranged from less than 10 to 60 percent along the creek and less than 10 to about 80
percent in the fields. Eye-height visibility ranged from about 30 m in the forested area to
greater than 100 m in the fields.
Parvin Branch’s channel ranges from 2 to 4 m wide and is about 3 m deep (Figure 3).
Clear water was flowing over a clay substrate that contained limestone gravel and
cobbles. The water ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 m deep. No knappable lithic resources were
seen on the bars or discovered in the creek’s vertical banks. Only minnows were seen in
the creek and that was adjacent to the railroad bridge.
The survey
Survey began at the northeast corner of the study area west of the Burling Northern
Railroad Bridge and went west. The USGS map is misleading. The tank shown on the
USGS map is much closer to Parvin Branch and the two are separated at times only by a
meter. Shovel test 1 was excavated on an area of land about 5 m wide between the tank
and the creek. The shovel test uncovered 35 cm of clay. Shovel test 2 was excavated
about 100 m west of the pond and encountered 36 cm of clay. Both shovel tests were
culturally sterile and no cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground
surface.
Shovel tests 3 through 11 uncovered culturally sterile clay that ranged from 35 to 42 cm
below the ground surface and no cultural materials were seen on the ground surface.
Shovel tests 12 through 24 were excavated along the southern bank of the creek and
uncovered culturally sterile clay ranging from 35 to 41 cm below the ground surface. No
cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface.

After Parvin Branch was investigated, areas approximately 200 m south of US 380 and
north of CR 26 were intensely investigated for any remnants of the historic residences
mapped on the 1930 Collin County Soils Map and the 1936 General Highway Map. No
remains such as a house foundation, root/storm cellar, cistern or well were found.
Conclusions
The absence of prehistoric sites is probably a result of the low biotic diversity and the
lack of perennial water. Knappable lithic resources also were not present. Historic
residences probably were removed so that the areas could be farmed, as indicated by the
fields present today.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based upon the absence of archaeological, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further
cultural resource investigations in the study area are unwarranted. If cultural resources
are encountered during construction, however, work should immediately cease in that
area and the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers should be notified.
Work should not continue until after consultation with the Corps of Engineers have been
completed.
