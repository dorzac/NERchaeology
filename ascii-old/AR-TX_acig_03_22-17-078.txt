Abstract
On June 14, 2017, aci consulting conducted a cultural resources survey for the
Georgetown Fire Station Waste Water Line Project in Williamson County, Texas.
The proposed waste water line will be constructed on a 5.15-acre tract, and the
proposed effluent water line will be approximately 2,171 feet in length, with a 50foot Right-of-Way (ROW) (Figures 1 and 2). The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for
the project is approximately 5.15 acres (2.08 hectares).
This work was conducted in compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC
26) under Texas Antiquities Code permit number 8050, as well as Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. One previously
recorded site, 41WM772, was revisited. The site is not recommended as eligible for
listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. The survey did not result in the location of any
new archeological sites, historic structures, or additional historic properties. Based
on these results, no further archeological work is recommended. Records from this
investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Julie
Shipp served as Principal Investigator.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
On June 14, 2017, aci consulting conducted a cultural resources survey for the
Georgetown Fire Station Waste Water Line Project in Williamson County, Texas.
The proposed waste water line will be constructed on a 5.15-acre tract, and the
proposed effluent water line will be approximately 2,171 feet in length, with a 50foot Right-of-Way (ROW) (Figures 1 and 2). The Area of Potential Effect (APE)
for the project is approximately 5.15 acres (2.08 hectares).
The project is conducted in compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC
26) under Texas Antiquities Code permit number 8050, as well as Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. The investigation
will consist of an intensive pedestrian survey, shovel testing, site recording,
assessment of sites for listing on the national Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), data analysis, and
reporting in accordance with THC and Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA)
standards.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
2.1

Physiography

The project is located northeast of Lake Georgetown in Williamson County in
central Texas in the south end of the Lampasas Cut Plain. The Lampasas Cut
Plain is characterized by rolling hills bisected by the Brazos River and its
tributaries to form broad, shallow valleys (Collins and Mear 1998). The Blackland
Prairie lies to the east of the project area on the eastern side of the Balcones
Escarpment, a fault zone with hills to the west and north and low relief to the
east and south. The Blackland Prairie supports prairie vegetation along with
small woods often found along low-gradient streams. The Edwards Plateau is
located to the west of the project area. This region differs from the Lampasas Cut
Plain in that the stream cut valleys are more deeply incised. Springs, karstic
sinks, caves, and rock shelters are characteristic of the region.
2.2

Geology and Soils

The geology of the region typically includes the Georgetown Formation
overlying the Edwards Limestone Group that interfingers with the Comanche
Peak Formation in Williamson County. These rocks are underlain by the Walnut
Formation, which has members including the Keys Valley Marl Member, the
Cedar Park Member, the Bee Cave Member, and the Bull Creek Member. Below
the Walnut Formation is the Glen Rose Formation, another marine limestone that
is a major groundwater source in the region (BEG 1997).
Only one soil is mapped within the APE (Figure 3). The soil series, Eckrant
extremely stony clay, 0 to 3 percent slopes (EeB), occupies shallow valleys and
broad ridges on uplands, irregular in shape, ranging from 50 to 500 acres. The
surface layer is stony, very dark gray clay about 11 inches thick. Beneath it is an
indurated limestone having fragments of limestone covering 25 percent of the
surface. The soil is moderately slowly permeable, the available water capacity is
very slow, and it is well drained (NRCS 2017). Eckrant soil series has has a low
probability to contain archeological sites (Abbott 2013).

3.0 REGIONAL HISTORY AND CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
3.1

Prehistoric Background

The property falls within the Central Texas archeological region (Collins 1995).
Prehistoric archeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous human
occupation starting around 11,500 years ago. Michael B. Collins (1995) authored a
synthesis of Central Texas archeology in which he divides the prehistory of
Central Texas into three periods: (1) the Paleoindian, (2) the Archaic, and (3) the
Late Prehistoric. Each of these is further divided into subperiods, such as early
and late. Dates are presented as Before Present or BP in Table 1.

Table 1. Regional Prehistoric Chronology of Central Texas
Period
Date Range
Paleoindian
11,500-8,800 BP
Archaic
8,800-1,200 BP
Early
8,800-6,000 BP
Middle
6,000-4,000 BP
Late
4,000-1,200 BP
Late Prehistoric
1,200-500 BP
Historic
500 BP +

The Paleoindian period dates between approximately 11,500 and 8,800 BP
(Collins 1995:381-3). The Early Paleoindian in Central Texas is part of a larger,
regional cultural horizon, the Clovis horizon. Clovis sites record a general
hunter-gatherer lifeway based upon a wide variety of fauna including large
herbivores as well as smaller animals. Evidence of plant resources is less
common, but it is presumed that local flora were also important to subsistence.
In contrast, later Folsom sites indicate a greater reliance upon big game hunting.
The Late Paleoindian seems transitional between the Paleoindian and Archaic in
that burned rock features are present, but they are not as large or ubiquitous as
those associated with the Archaic. Other artifacts, features, and faunal remains
seem more similar to those found later in the Archaic.
Archaic (Collins 1995:383-385) sites in Central Texas are most often associated
with the use of heated rock in hearths, ovens, middens, and scatters. The period

June 2017
aci Project No.: 22-17-078

austin • denver

as a whole is defined by the intensified use of local resources and diversity of
material culture in comparison to the Paleoindian period. The climate ranged
from mesic (relatively moist) in the Early Archaic and the later part of the Late
Archaic to xeric (relatively dry) during the Middle Archaic and beginning of the
Late Archaic. Subsistence during mesic times is centered on the live-oak savanna,
while a shift in emphasis toward xerophytes may have occurred during xeric
intervals.
The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups,
primarily from the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics
into the archeological record takes place in the region during this time as well.
The movement of Europeans inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended
the prehistoric era.
3.2

Historic Background

Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the
late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when Spanish explorers traveled
through the region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas.
Captain Alonso De León followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop
several times during the 1680s, and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de
Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and Captain Domingo Ramon, a
Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and camped on the banks of
Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them Arroyo do las
Bendítas Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, the Marques de
Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through presentday Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions. In the mideighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established along the San
Gabriel River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753 drought
and disease made the missions uninhabitable, and Spanish influence in the area
declined (Odintz 2002).
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In
1835 continual attacks by local Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and
his company of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the

headwaters of Brushy Creek in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson
Fort, as it was called, was abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded
Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several
veterans of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838 Dr. Thomas Kenney
and his family built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson
County. Kenney’s Fort became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County.
However, Indian attacks were a frequent problem, and numerous settlers,
including Kenney, were killed by Indians. By 1846 the Indian threat had waned
and settlement in the region increased. In 1848 the Texas legislature established
Williamson County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a Milam County Judge
and state senator.
By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the
San Gabriel (Odintz 2002), but a few families were living in the western half.
During the 1850s and 1860s, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up
around the county. Although urbanization and industrialization increased
somewhat, the bulk of the county remained rural and agricultural. The majority
of the families lived on subsistence farms in log houses and raised corn. During
the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave population increased and the agricultural
patterns within the county became more diverse. Wheat and corn were the
predominant crops in the Blackland prairies, and cattle and sheep ranching was
widespread throughout the county. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but it
was not a significant cash crop.
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War but picked
up again in the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the
expansion of cotton farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisholm
trail, which was established in 1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle
drives passed through or originated in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s
were also marked by the arrival of railroads to Williamson County (Odintz 2002).
By the early twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry
in importance. With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm

tenancy developed. As late as 1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by
owners. By 1890 43 percent of the farms were worked by owners, and by 1930
only 29 percent of the farms were worked by owners. The tenancy rates
continued to drop during the Great Depression (Odintz 2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of
soil depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil
infestation. The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation
and encouraged farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton
production was reduced by nearly half, while sorghum and wheat became
important crops. Along with cattle and sheep, poultry farming intensified
(Odintz 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and
1980s. The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped
areas of Williamson County meant urban populations now had easier access to
the Hill Country and vice versa. The consolidation of rural schools also meant
children could now attend schools outside of their rural communities. For
example, during the 1910s and 1920s, Rock House School was one of the largest
schools in Williamson County. In 1903, the school boasted a population of 96
students and 2 teachers. The school was consolidated with Liberty Hill School in
1947, and by the 1990s, Rock House had become a dispersed agricultural
community.
Suburbanization of the portions of the county bordering Austin caused the
population of Williamson County to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the
population of Williamson County was 37,305. By 1982, the population had grown
to over 85,700 (Odintz 2002). A pattern of absentee ownership and of nonagricultural use of the land also intensified following World War II. Austin,
Georgetown, and Liberty Hill grew rapidly.
4.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
A literature review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) revealed that a
small section of previously surveyed ROW intersects the project near the
northwest end of the proposed alignment. The southern portion of the proposed
Georgetown Fire Station Waste Water Line

austin • denver

waste water line ends adjacent to a survey conducted by aci conducted in 2013.
The 2013 survey included a revisit of previously recorded site 41WM772. The site
is a large prehistoric lithic procurement site. The portion of the lithic
procurement site within the easement does not contribute to its eligibility for
listing as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) or inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Beyond the observed primarily surface
manifestation of site 41WM772, no intact prehistoric or historic deposits were
discovered within the proposed wastewater line easement. Based on the results
of this survey, no further archeological work was recommended (Barnes and
Scott 2013).
In addition to 41WM722, twelve more sites have been recorded within one
kilometer of the project alignment (Atlas 2017) (Figure 4). A summary of all sites
can be found in Table 2.

5.0 FIELD METHOD
A pedestrian survey of the APE will be conducted to locate any archeological
sites or other historical properties that may be adversely affected by construction.
The pedestrian survey will be conducted within the entire APE. The subject area
will be walked in parallel transects spaced sufficiently to adequately cover the
100-foot-wide APE. Shovel tests will be placed judgmentally in settings that have
potential for buried cultural horizons and/or if the ground surface visibility is
less than 30 percent.
All shovel tests will be excavated one foot (30 centimeters) in diameter to the
bottom of Holocene deposits. The shovel tests will be dug in 10 centimeter levels,
and the soil will be screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth unless high clay or
water content requires that the material be troweled through or sorted by hand.
Shovel tests will be recorded on logs and the locations of the tests will be
recorded on a GPS unit. Other field forms will include a daily journal,
photograph log, and site forms.
Newly discovered sites will be assigned a temporary field designation and
digital TexSite Archaeological Data Collection forms will be submitted to TARL
for the assignment of trinomials. The location of each archeological site will be
recorded on a USGS 7.5-minute topographic map, and a sketch map will be
drawn showing the location of all salient features at the site. The site setting and
features will be photographed. This will be a non-collection survey thus artifacts
will be photographed in the field. Select diagnostic artifacts may be collected.
If surface visibility is less than 30 percent, then a minimum of six shovel tests will
be executed to delimit site boundaries. The newly recorded sites will be
evaluated for potential significance, NRHP inclusion or SAL listing eligibility.
The survey methods will comply with THC and CTA standards for site
investigation.
The portions of previously recorded site 41WM722 will be revisited in order to
delineate the extent of the site within the APE. The nature of the site within the
APE will be assessed for its contribution to the site as a whole, and for its
eligibility for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. The work at this site will include
the submission of a revisit site form.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
The survey was conducted under pleasant warm conditions in the morning,
under a clear sky, with a light breeze. The current APE runs northwest to
southeast adjacent to the Georgetown Fire Station #5, makes a 90 degree turn,
and runs northeast to southwest adjacent to the Georgetown Police Department.
A majority of the APE runs through an easement along the back parking lots of
the buildings. Directly east, adjacent to a majority of the APE, is a Karst preserve,
enclosed with a 10-foot fence (Figure 5). To the west of a majority of the APE is a
silt fence as a result of construction of the Police and Fire Station buildings and
respective parking lots. The north end of the APE is between the Georgetown
Police Station and a shopping center parking lot and drive way (Figure 6). To the
west of the north end of the APE is D B Wood Road (Figure 7).
The line survey started at the southern end of the APE on the Fire Station tract.
The ground surface visibility in this area was good, averaging above 30 percent.
The soil consisted primarily of stony clay with portions of exposed bedrock and
large cobbles of chert (Figure 8). Thus, shovel testing was not deemed necessary.
Site 41WM772
The site was originally recorded as a large prehistoric lithic procurement site.
Only the portion of the site within the APE was revisited. The portion of the
lithic procurement site within the easement does not contribute to its eligibility
for listing as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) or inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP), were the site later to be deemed eligible. Due
to the construction of the Georgetown Police Station and parking lot, the site
boundaries of 41WM772 have diminished (Figure 9). Only three lithic artifacts
were observed within the APE (Figure 10). They were unifacially worked chert
fragments, and were not likely in primary context due to significant disturbances
from the construction of the Georgetown Police Station. No diagnostics artifacts
or prehistoric cultural features were observed within the APE.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On June 14, 2017, aci consulting conducted a cultural resources survey for the
Georgetown Fire Station Waste Water Line Project in Williamson County, Texas.
The proposed waste water line will be constructed on a 5.15-acre tract, and the
proposed effluent water line will be approximately 2,171 feet in length, with a 50foot Right-of-Way (ROW). The APE for the project is approximately 5.15 acres
(2.08 hectares).
Site 41WM772 is a previously recorded lithic procurement site. Only the portion
of the site that intersects with the APE was investigated. Three unifacially
worked chert fragments observed, but the site lacked features and diagnostic
artifacts. Redrawn site boundaries were submitted to TARL along with a revisit
form. No further work is recommended at site 41WM772.

The investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey and did not result in the
location of new archeological sites, nor any other historic properties. Based on
these results, no further archeological work is recommended. It must be noted
that no level of survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural features
within a project area. Therefore, should previously-unrecorded cultural
resources, including human remains, be discovered during the course of
construction for this project, Williamson County will contact a qualified
professional archeologist to assess the findings.
