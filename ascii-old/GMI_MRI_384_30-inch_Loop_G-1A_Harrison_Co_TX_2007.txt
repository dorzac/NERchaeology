ABSTRACT

In February 2007, Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted an archeological survey in East Texas near the
town of Marshall, Harrison County, for Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, Longview,
Texas, on behalf of Kinder Morgan, Inc. Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), a
subsidiary of Kinder-Morgan, Inc., has proposed the construction of the North Lansing
Nominated Storage Service Project (North Lansing NSS) in East Texas. In compliance with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requirements under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), URS Corporation conducted the original archaeological survey for the North
Lansing Storage Expansion Project (Tucker 2005), now known as the current North Lansing NSS
project, certified by FERC under docket No. CP05-405-000. Modifications have been proposed,
resulting in minor increases and /or changes of the project area and requiring the need for
additional surveys.

The current project is the survey of three areas where the modified

construction boundaries are proposed to exceed the originally surveyed areas. The archeological
survey of Areas A (G-1A), Area B (H-1 Launcher), and Area C (a 200-x-60-ft area at MP 0.0)
was conducted to determine the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate any
identified resources for eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, as per
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended.

No archeological resources were identified during the archeological survey of Areas A, B, and C
within the boundaries of the North Lansing NSS project area.
investigations are recommended.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

In February 2007, Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), conducted an archeological survey in East Texas near
the town of Marshall in Harrison County for Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, Longview,
Texas, on behalf of Kinder Morgan, Inc. (GMI project no. 30563.00.02). Natural Gas Pipeline
Company of America (Natural), a subsidiary of Kinder-Morgan, Inc., has proposed the
construction of the North Lansing Nominated Storage Service Project (North Lansing NSS) in
East Texas.

In compliance with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)

requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), URS Corporation conducted
the original archaeological survey for the North Lansing Storage Expansion Project (Tucker
2005), now known as the current North Lansing NSS project, certified by FERC under docket
No. CP05-405-000. Modifications have been proposed, resulting in minor increases and /or
changes of the project area and requiring the need for additional surveys. The current project is
the survey of three areas where the modified construction boundaries are proposed to exceed the
originally surveyed areas. The archeological survey of Areas A (G-1A), Area B (H-1 Launcher),
and Area C (a 200-x-60-ft area at MP 0.0) within the boundaries of the North Lansing NSS
project (Figures 1 and 2). The goal of the archeological investigations was to determine the
presence/absence of any cultural resources within the three project areas and to evaluate
identified resources for eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, as per
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended.

The three distinct project areas discussed in this report are all located within the boundaries of the
proposed North Lansing NSS project area in Harrison County, Texas. Project Area A, the survey
area for G-1A is approximately 1 mile long and 160 feet (ft) wide, crossing FM 2208

approximately 2,300 ft south of the intersection of FM 449 and FM 2208 in Harrison County,
northeast of Longview, Texas. The G-1A is a new storage field pipeline paralleling and looping
an existing pipeline referred to as G-1. The G-1A was originally proposed to be located on the
north side of the existing G-1, but the proposed alignment has been moved to the south side of the
G-1. Two intermittent drainages cross the project area from north to south and flow into a small
perennial stream that is a tributary of Moccasin Creek. The elevation of Project Area A ranges
from 370 ft above mean sea level (amsl) at the west end to 280 ft amsl at the east end.

Project Area B, the survey area for the H-1 Launcher is 300 ft long and 100 ft wide and located
southeast of Forest Hill Church at a bend in Forest Hill Church Road. The area surveyed runs
west from the road onto the previously surveyed H-1 Launcher site. The elevation of Project
Area B is 370 ft amsl and the closest source of water is an intermittent drainage 1,500 ft to the
south that flows into Moccasin Creek.

Project Area C, the survey area at milepost (MP) 0.0 is adjacent to a previously surveyed area at
MP0.0 on the new 8.7 mile pipeline known as the 30 inch loop; Area C may also be referred to as
the Moxley Tract.. It is a 200-ft-long and 60-ft-wide area at MP 0.0 located on the west side of
State Highway 154 just south of the intersection of State Highway 154 and two existing pipeline
corridors, northwest of Marshall, Texas. The elevation of Project Area C is 400 ft amsl, and an
intermittent drainage begins 750 ft to the southwest and flows south into Potters Creek.

This report presents the results of the archeological survey of Areas A, B, and C within the
boundaries of the North Lansing NSS project. The archeological survey conducted by GMI
personnel involved pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and creek bank examination on February 21
and 22, 2007. Ms. Melissa Green served as the Principal Investigator. Ms. Kristen J. Bastis was
the Project Archeologist and Ms. Diamond Kapanday served as crew; Ms. Michelle Wurtz
created the maps for the report.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project areas lie within the Gulf Coastal Plains physiographic province, a segment of the
Mesozoic-Cenozoic coastal geosyncline (Murray 1960). This geosyncline forms a gradually
sloping basin that dips toward the Gulf of Mexico and contains formations of limestone and
sandstone deposited along the margins of an ancient receding coastline.

The project areas are situated on a series of uplands developed on the Queen City Sand, which
dates to the Eocene period. The Queen City Sand is composed of light gray to brownish gray
locally carbonaceous quartz sand and gray to brown clay.

It includes common ironstone

concretions and ledges and local beds of glauconite-quartz greensand (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1965).

Five different soil units are mapped for the investigated project areas (Golden et al. 1994). These
soil units consist of Bowie very fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes; Cuthbert fine sandy loam,
5 to 15 percent slopes; Kirvin very fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes; Lilbert loamy fine
sand, 2 to 5 percent slopes; and Sawyer very fine sandy loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes.

Bowie very fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes, is a deep soil that occurs on uplands on
slightly convex flats and saddles between hilltops. It is moderately acidic at the surface layer
becoming increasingly more acidic with depth. This soil is moderately well drained, permeability
is moderately slow, and runoff is moderate. A typical profile consists of a 12.7-centimeter (cm;
5-inch [in]) surface layer of dark brown very fine sandy loam above a 12.7-cm (5-in) subsurface
layer of yellowish brown very fine sandy loam. Subsoil occurs at 25.4 cm (10 in) below ground
5

surface as yellowish brown sandy clay loam with a few yellowish red mottles. At 58.4 cm (23 in)
the subsoil is yellowish brown clay loam with yellowish red and red mottles. Between 78.7 and
116.8 cm (31 and 46 in) soils are yellowish brown sandy clay loam mottled with yellowish red
and red soils and contain red plinthite nodules. The underlying 55.9 cm (22 in) consists of
yellowish brown sandy clay loam with light brownish gray, brownish yellow, and red mottles and
very pale brown sand streaks. Red plinthite nodules are common. A layer of mottled strong
brown, gray, yellowish brown, and red sandy clay loam with a few black concretions and red
plinthite nodules occurs at 172.7 to 210.8 cm (68 to 83 in). A bottom layer of mottled gray, dark
red, brownish yellow, and yellowish brown sandy clay loam extends 210.8 to 243.8 cm (83 to 96
in) (Golden et al. 1994).

Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes, is moderately deep and is present over weakly
consolidated sandstone on uplands. It occurs on hill slopes overlooking drainage ways. This soil
is well drained with moderately slow permeability. Runoff is rapid and poses a severe hazard for
water erosion. Soil acidity is moderate in the surface layer and increases with soil depth.
Typically, this soil has a 10.1-cm (4-in) surface layer of very dark gray fine sandy loam underlain
by a 5.1-cm (2-in) subsurface layer of brown fine sandy loam. Subsoil usually occurs at 15.2 cm
(6 in) and consists primarily of red clay. At 40.6 cm (16 in), this clay develops dark red and
strong brown mottles. At 66 cm (26 in), the subsoil becomes a mottle of red and strong brown
clay. Substratum extends from 86.4 to 152.4 cm (34 to 60 in) and consists of mottled red, strong
brown, and light brownish gray stratified, weakly consolidated sandstone and clay (Golden et al.
1994).

Kirvin very fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes, is a gently sloping soil found on oval and
oblong ridges and stream divides. This soil is well drained with moderately slow permeability
and runoff is moderate. Generally, the surface layer is slightly acidic dark brown to brown
(7.5YR 3/2â7.5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, about 35 cm (14 in) thick. The subsurface layer is
a very strongly acidic dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay, with a moderate fine subangular blocky
structure approximately 78 cm (35 in) thick. This in turn is underlain by a C horizon of very
strongly acid stratified red clay (2.5YR 3/6) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), weakly
consolidated sandstone and shale having a texture of clay loam. Flakes of mica are common
(Golden et al 1994).

6

Lilbert loamy fine sand, 2 to 5 percent slopes, is a very deep soil that occurs on upland ridges and
broad interstream divides. This soil is well drained with moderately slow permeability. Runoff is
slow. Generally, the surface layer consists of 22.9 cm (9 in) of strongly acidic, dark brown loamy
fine sand. The subsuface layer is also strongly acidic loamy fine sand. From 22.9 to 35.6 cm (9
to 14 in), it is brown, and from 35.6 to 58.4 cm (14 to 23 in), it is light yellowish brown. When
present, the underlying subsoil is yellowish brown sandy clay loam that begins as medium acidic
but turns to very strongly acidic at 109.2 cm (43 in). The upper 51 cm (20 in) contains yellowish
red mottles. From 109.2 to 195.6 (43 to 77 in), these mottles are accompanied by strong brown
mottles and plinthite nodules. The remaining 7.6 cm (3 in) contains red and light brownish gray
mottles (Golden et al 1994).

Sawyer very fine sandy loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, is a very deep soil that is present on low
uplands. It is moderately well drained with slow permeability. Runoff is slow. Surface and
subsurface layers are strongly acidic and the subsoil and substratum are very strongly acidic. A
typical soil profile consists of a 20.3-cm (8 in) surface layer of dark grayish brown very fine
sandy loam with a few dark yellowish brown mottles. The underlying 12.7-cm (5 in) subsurface
layer is brown very fine sandy loam with yellowish brown mottles. Subsoil occurs at 33 cm
(13 in), and to a depth of 53.3 cm (21 in), it consists of yellowish brown loam with lenses of
brown silt and very fine sand. From 53.3 to 66 cm (21 to 26 in), the subsoil is yellowish brown
clay loam with light brownish gray and yellowish brown mottles and pale brown silt and very fine
sand lenses. From 66 to 78.7 cm (26 to 31 in), the subsoil is mottled light brownish gray and
yellowish brown clay loam. The lowest subsoil layer extends to 162.6 cm (64 in) and is gray clay
with dark red, reddish brown, and yellowish brown mottles. The substratum terminates at 203.2
cm (80 in). It is light brownish gray clay loam with dark red, reddish brown, and yellowish red
mottles (Golden et al. 1994).

CLIMATE
Northeast Texas has a humid, mesothermal climate (Nixon 1985:7), marked by long hot summers
and short cool winters. The primary influences on the climate are the latitude, warm winds from
the Gulf of Mexico, and cooler northern winds from the continental landmass to the north. Cold
waves in the winter are rare and not severe, usually lasting only one or two days. Temperatures
7

rarely exceed 40ÂºCelsius (C; 104ÂºFahrenheit [F]) in the summer or fall below -13ÂºC (9ÂºF) in the
winter, but the variation is sufficient to produce four distinct seasonsâa mild winter, a warm
spring, a hot summer, and a warm autumn. The number of days in the growing season with
temperatures above the freezing mark averages between 203 and 207 (Golden et al. 1994; Nixon
1985:7; Roberts 1983).

Precipitation is fairly heavy throughout the year. Prolonged droughts are rare, and the frequent
afternoon thunderstorms in summer are adequate to maintain crops. Severe storms, including
tornadoes, strike the area occasionally and often cause flooding and erosion. Every few years in
the summer or fall, a tropical depression moves inland, causing extremely heavy rains for one to
three days. Average annual precipitation ranges from 921 millimeters (mm) to about 1,412 mm
(34.5â56 in) and is usually distributed uniformly throughout the year (Golden et al. 1994; Nixon
1985:7; Roberts 1983). Because the average winter temperature is above freezing, snowfall is
variable but rare, averaging just 50 mm (1.95 in; Golden et al. 1994; Roberts 1983).

FLORA
The project areas are located within the East Texas Pineywoods biotic region and are
encompassed by the Pine-Hardwood forest (Subtype 2: Shortleaf Pine-Post Oak-Southern Red
Oak). The Shortleaf Pine-Post Oak-Southern Red Oak forest covers a large portion of Northeast
Texas, including Harrison County, and occurs on sandy uplands. The most common trees present
within this vegetation zone are red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus stellata), hickory
(Carya spp.), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata). Other associated species within this zone are
loblolly pine (P. taeda), black hickory (C. texana), sandjack oak (Q. incana), flowering dogwood
(Cornus florida), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), sweetgum (Liquidambar
styraciflua), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), greenbrier (Smilax spp.), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), wax
myrtle (Myrica californica), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), hawthorn
(Crataegus spp.), supplejack (Berchemia scandens), winged elm (Ulmus alata), beaked panicum
(Panicum anceps), spranglegrass (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum
nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), three-awn (Aristida spp.), bushclover (Lilium spp.), and
tickclover (Desmodium spp.) (McMahan et al. 1984:25).

In addition to the timber and wood resources of the area, acorns, nuts, berries, and grasses were
also available to prehistoric and historic groups alike. The presence of acorns and hickory nuts
would have proved beneficial in several ways. Both are high in fats and could have provided a
substantial addition to the diet, as they did for many historic southeastern Native American
groups (Hilliard 1980), though acorns require extensive processing to be edible. During the fall,
they would have attracted white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and turkey (Meleagris
gallopavo), both important prey species for later historic southeastern groups (Swanton 1946).
Trees bearing edible nuts identified in East Texas include eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra),
pecan (Carya illinoensis), shellbark hickory (C. laciniosa), shagbark hickory (C. ovata),
mockernut hickory (C. tometosa), black hickory (C. texana), nutmeg hickory (C.
myristicaeformis), swamp hickory (C. leiodermis), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American beech
(Fagus grandifolia), common chinquapin (Castanea pumila), Florida chinquapin (Castanea
alnifolia), white oak (Q. alba), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and live oak (Q. virginiana)
(Heartfield and Dieste 1984a, 1984b:2â5; Vines 1977).

Wild fruits and berries, such as blackberry and dewberry (Rubus spp.), wild grape (Vitis spp.),
wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana), persimmon (Diospyros spp.), and plum and cherry
(Prunus spp.), would have provided a source of vitamins and carbohydrates for both prehistoric
and historic populations. Seeds of various trees, shrubs, grasses, and weeds would have attracted
the animals that would in turn provide additional food. Finally, certain tubers available in the
woodlands could have been collected for food as well as for use in medicinal, craft, or ritual
activities (Heartfield and Dieste 1984a, 1984b:2â5).

FAUNA
Faunal resources within Northeast Texas could have provided many of the daily needs for both
prehistoric and early historic populations.

Animal products would have provided shelter,

clothing, and a means of exchange, as well as antler and shell for tools, and feathers and various
skins for decorations. In addition, it is safe to say that numerous types of invertebrates were
abundant along the major streams, as well as various types of mollusks, including both bivalves
and gastropods, and crustaceans known to have been used by historic southeastern Native
American tribes (Swanton 1946). Among the fish resources, economically important families for
9

both prehistoric and historic populations probably would have included gar (Lepisosteus spp.),
crappie (Pomoxis spp.), bass (Micropterus spp.), buffalo (Ictiobus spp.), shad (Dorosoma spp.),
carp (Cyprinus spp.), bowfin (Amia calva), shiner (Notropis spp.), pickerel (Esox americanus),
catfish (Ictalaurus spp.), sunfish (Lepomis spp.), and drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) (Heartfield
and Dieste 1984a, 1984b:2â6). Of the amphibians and reptiles, only true frogs (Rana spp.) and
softshell turtles (Trionychidae spp.) are valued for dietary purposes today, but the full range of
frogs, land and water turtles, turtle eggs, salamanders, and alligators (Alligator mississippiensis)
would have been useful for both prehistoric and early historic populations. A wide variety of
migratory birds, such as ducks, geese, and cranes, would have been most numerous in the late fall
and early winter, and other resident birds, such as turkeys (M. gallopavo) and doves (Zenaida
spp.), would have been available on a year-round basis.

Species of mammals that are known to have provided staple meat supplies for historic
southeastern Native American groups include deer (O. virginianus), black bear (Ursus
americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), and rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.) (Swanton 1946), and the same
was undoubtedly the case for early European populations. Other important mammal resources
included opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Additional mammals
present in Northeast Texas today include least shrew (Cryptotis parva), southeastern short-tailed
shrew (Blarina carolinensis), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), southeastern myotis (Myotis
aelleni), red bat (Lasiurus borealis), evening bat (Nycteceius humeralis), nine-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), eastern harvest mouse
(Reithrodontomys humulis), fulvous harvest mouse (R. fulvescens), cotton mouse (Peromyscus
gossypinus), cotton rat (Sigmodon Hispidus), eastern wood rat (Neotoma floridana), woodland
vole (Microtus pinetorum), mink (Mustela vison), and river otter (Lutra canadensis) (Schmidly
1983). Animal furs were one important resource of the early historic period, forming the basis of
the early fur trade in Louisiana and East Texas (Usner 1992). Valuable fur-bearing animals
would have included rabbit, beaver (Castor canadiens), raccoon, weasel and mink (Mustela spp.),
ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), opossum, red fox (Vulpes vulpes), gray fox (Urocyon
cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Felis rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), badger (Taxidea taxus), spotted
skunk (Spilogale spp.), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and
otter. Many species, such as fish and waterfowl, may not presently be available within the area
but would have been available in the past.

10

Deer, rabbit, squirrel, and turtle have generally been among the most numerous animal remains
recovered from archeological sites in Northeast Texas (Bruseth and Perttula 1981); but deer, due
to its large size, actually provided the bulk of animal protein in the diet of prehistoric and early
historic peoples. Remains of reptiles other than turtle and small rodents have also been recovered
from archeological contexts at many sites in Texas, but it is uncertain whether or not they
contributed to the diet or were simply intrusive into the deposits (see Martin et al. 1987).

Obviously, the availability of these plant and animal resources may well have been different in
the past as a consequence of regional climatic alterations that have been documented in pollen
and geomorphological records in Texas and Oklahoma.

In spite of this, faunal studies at

archeological sites, such as Rogers Rockshelter in southwestern Missouri, have shown that, as
climate changed over the past 9,000 to 10,000 years, different habitats comprising the mosaic of
the total environment responded by increasing or decreasing in size.

The climatic shifts,

however, were never significant enough to precipitate a complete change in species composition
(Purdue 1983). Thus, the modern distribution of animal species is probably much the same as it
was in the past, with only the relative abundance of each species being different.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION
The following chapter is intended to provide a general background to the archeology of Northeast
Texas. This chapter is divided into three sections, the first of which briefly discusses the nature
of the prehistoric and historic Native American archeological records in broad terms. The second
considers the historic Euro-American and African-American settlement in the area, and the third
gives a brief summary of previous archeological research carried out within 1 mile of the current
project areas.

CHRONOLOGY

Native American Cultural Chronology
The following brief discussion of the prehistoric archeological record in the vicinity of the project
areas in Northeast Texas draws from previous summaries by Perttula (1988), Story (1981, 1985,
1990), and Thurmond (1985, 1988, 1990). The cultural sequences for each area are presented in
Table 1 and in the subsequent discussion.

Paleo-Indian Period
Although a pre-Clovis occupation of the New World has long been suggested (Adovasio et al.
1990; Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990; McGahey n.d.;
Meltzer 1989), it has not been until the excavations at the Monte Verde site in Chile that the
evidence for an occupation prior to 12,000 years before present (B.P.) has been widely accepted.
Within the southeastern United States, however, the evidence for a pre-Clovis occupation remains
disputed, and the Paleo-Indian period remains the earliest recognized human occupation in Texas.

The Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas (ca. 9500â7000 years before Christ [B.C.]) generally
includes those remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the
immediate post-Pleistocene periods (for recent reviews of this period in Northeast Texas, see
Johnson 1989; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). As a matter of convenience, the
period can be subdivided into an early Paleo-Indian period (ca. 9500â8500 B.C.) and a late PaleoIndian period (8500â7000 B.C.).

Unfortunately, although numerous Paleo-Indian diagnostic

projectile points, such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff, and San Patrice, have been
13

recovered as isolated surface finds or excavated in later contexts (Carley n.d.; Perttula 1988:17),
few Paleo-Indian sites in good stratigraphic context have been found (Perttula 1988:17; Preston
1972, 1974), and fewer have received any sort of systematic excavation. Both Perttula and Story
noted the possible presence of horizontally stratified early Paleo-Indian deposits at the Forrest
Murphey site (41MR62) at Lake Oâ the Pines, but the site was reportedly destroyed by dam
construction before being excavated (Perttula 1988:17; Perttula et al. 1986:47; Story 1990:184â
185). The situation of the Murphey site and the discovery of the deeply buried Clovis-age
Aubrey site (41DN479) along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River in Northcentral Texas (Ferring
1989, 1990, 2001) suggest that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northeast Texas will only be
found by examining deeply stratified Pleistocene terraces or by penetrating more recent Holocene
alluvium in modern flood plains.

Despite the lack of good data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas, some
attempts have been made to model settlement mobility and intensity of site occupation, drawing
on the limited data that are known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other areas.
For instance, numerous researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of group mobility in the
broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of presumably
nonlocal lithic raw materials from which they were made (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Shafer 1977;
Story 1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of large megafauna by PaleoIndians in the western United States, coupled with the known presence of similar species in
Northeast Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Hemmings 1983; Slaughter and
Hoover 1963), has resulted in the popular conclusion that âbig game huntingâ was part of the
Paleo-Indian subsistence strategy in Northeast Texas. Although a possible association between a
Clovis point and mastodon remains at the Murphey site (Story 1990:185) does support this
likelihood, increasing evidence from sites to the west (such as the Aubrey site) suggests that
Paleo-Indian groups were less dependent upon âbig game huntingâ than has been assumed in the
past.

The late Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas appears to be distinguished by the divergence of
the earlier, widespread fluted point tradition into several distinctive subtraditions. The first of
these includes Scottsbluff, Plainview, and similar lanceolate points that appear to be part of a
more western or âplains-derivedâ subtradition in terms of origin and style; the second includes
Dalton and Dalton-related projectile points that have a wide distribution throughout the wooded
14

southeastern and midwestern United States. Some researchers have suggested that this Dalton
horizon represents an adaptation to the changing environment at the end of the Pleistocene
(Goodyear 1982:389â391), a view that has found some support in the addition of the Dalton adze,
a presumed âheavy, woodworking tool,â to what otherwise is viewed as a Paleo-Indian tool kit
(Kelley et al. 1988:21). San Patrice, an important complex that may be related to Dalton, is found
in eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and southern Arkansas and is
characterized by San Patrice points, Keithville points, and Albany scrapers (Ensor 1987;
Schambach 1979; Webb et al. 1971).

Archaic Period
With the end of the Ice Age, the prehistoric residents of the region began to develop into localized
populations of efficient hunter-gatherers, exploiting localized resource bases. This period, and
the subsistence pattern that characterizes it, has come to be known as the Archaic. The Archaic
represents a long period of time that was characterized by only gradual and minor changes in
subsistence patterns, lithic technology, and projectile point styles and was apparently a period of
strong cultural stability. Archaic populations are usually portrayed as generalized hunters and
gatherers with more limited geographic ranges than the preceding Paleo-Indian peoples.

The Archaic period in Northeast Texas is tentatively dated between 7000 and 200 B.C. As is true
for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of early, middle, and late
âsubperiods,â has been applied in Northeast Texas. Although reliable dating for the Archaic
period in this area of Texas is virtually nonexistent, these divisions have been given tentative
dates on the basis of better-dated sites in surrounding areas. Thus the Early Archaic has been
dated from 7000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic
from 2000 to 200 B.C. (overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Fields
and Tomka 1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1985, 1990). Archaic remains are
usually found in upland settings and are frequently mixed with later material (Campbell et al.
1983; Story 1981). General trends that have been proposed as characterizing the Archaic period
in Northeast Texas include an increasingly complex settlement system, increasing population size
and density, increasing sedentism, and the development of distinct group territories (Perttula
1988:17; Story 1985:52).
15

During the Early Archaic (ca. 7000â4000 B.C.), the occurrence of small and widely distributed
sites has been suggested to reflect high group mobility within large and poorly defined territories,
based on a generalized hunting and gathering economy (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Story 1985:35,
39). Projectile point forms that may be associated with the Early Archaic in Northeast Texas
include Kirk, Keithville, Palmer, Cossatot, Dawson, and Wells (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).

In comparison to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period (4000â2000 B.C.) appears to be
characterized by (1) an increased diversity of tool types; (2) greater interregional variability; (3)
the addition of ground, pecked, and polished stone tools; and (4) an increased use of plant foods
as indicated by the addition of mortars, pestles, and mealing stones (Neuman 1984:77, 79). The
dependence upon abundant forest resources (e.g., oak mast production, deer, and small mammals)
that are evenly distributed over most of the region probably resulted in evenly distributed
population densities and favored the development of exclusive or âfixedâ territories (Plog and
Upham 1983:202; Story 1985:41). Diagnostic dart points that may be associated with the Middle
Archaic include Big Sandy, Calf Creek, Johnson, Carrollton, Morrill, Evans, Lone Oak, Trinity,
and Wesley (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).

Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period in Northeast Texas
(ca. 2000â200 B.C.) as evidenced by an apparent increase in the number of sites, a greater
distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of increasing degrees of sedentism. At the
same time, group mobility may have become more limited, and interregional contact may have
become much more common.

Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic period sites are

relatively common in the uplands and a number are known from the flood plain of the Red River,
but no regional phases have yet been identified (Schambach 1982a:3-6). Dart points that may be
diagnostic of the Late Archaic include Lange, Castroville, Ellis, Palmillas, Edgewood,
Yarbrough, Ensor, and Kent (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).

Early Ceramic Period
The Early Ceramic period (200 B.C.âA.D. 800) in Northeast Texas is generally not well defined
and is largely identified by similarities in pottery and projectile points to sites of the Fourche
Maline tradition north of the Red River (recent overviews that provide good information for this
16

period include Perttula et al. 1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). Diagnostic
artifacts consist of coarse plainware ceramics, tempered with either clay/grog or bone, and Gary
projectile points. The ceramics generally are grouped together as Williams Plain; but given the
wide range of temporal and spatial variability present, they should probably be viewed as one or
more undefined varieties of that type (Story 1981:146). Discounting ceramic differences at the
varietal level, the remains of the Early Ceramic period in Northeast Texas seem to be most
closely related to Schambachâs (1982b:188, 1998) Fourche Maline tradition in Arkansas. Despite
other similarities to Fourche Maline, however, no Early Ceramic period burial mounds are known
in the Texas portion of the Great Bend. The few that are known in East Texas occur to the south
in the Sabine and Neches river basins around the Toledo Bend and Sam Rayburn areas (see Story
1990:Figure 41) at the Coral Snake (16SA48) and Jonas Short (41SA25) mound sites (Jensen
1968; McClurkan et al. 1966, 1980). The lack of such evidence in Northeast Texas leaves open
the question of whether or not this area was undergoing the same processes of cultural evolution
presumably responsible for the development of burial mound use elsewhere (see Perttula
1988:18; Story 1990).

Perttula (1988:18) has noted what appears to be a major presence of Early Ceramic period
occupation within the Sulphur River basin, although this may be more the result of intensity of
research or factors of site preservation rather than the actual presence of a large Early Ceramic
population. In regard to modeling settlement patterns during this period, Perttula (1988:18)
suggests that âEarly Ceramic or Fourche Maline settlements are . . . represented by villages and
hamlets in the floodplains or terraces of larger streams, and by smaller components in the
uplands.â Many of the sites on which Perttula bases this model, including Snipes at Wright
Patman Lake (Jelks 1961) and Tick, Thomas, Hurricane Hill, and Lawson at Cooper Lake
(Doehner and Larson 1978; Martin 1996a, 1996b; Perttula 1990), contain middens that are taken
as indicating a more sedentary settlement pattern than that of the preceding Archaic period. Two
apparent pits (Features 1 and 2) radiocarbon dated to the Early Ceramic period (1,460 Â±60 B.P.
and 2,090 Â±30 B.P., respectively) at 41HP137 at Cooper Lake yielded hickory nut, acorn, wild
tubers (possibly the Prairie turnip, Pediomelum or Psoralea sp.), and what may be fragments of
cultivated squash or gourd (Fields et al. 1994:12; McGregor 1996:357).

17

Caddo Period in the Big Cypress Creek Basin
The Caddo period in the Cypress Creek basin has been subdivided into early, middle, and late
subperiods: the Early Caddo from ca. A.D. 800 to 1300, the Middle Caddo from ca. A.D. 1300 to
1400, and the Late Caddo from A.D. 1400 to 1600 (see Thurmond 1990:39â40). Thurmondâs
(1990) Early Caddo period includes components related to the Alto and Sanders foci and is
subdivided into two parts. Ceramic types characteristic of Period 1 (A.D. 800â1100) include
Holly Fine Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro Engraved, Kiam Incised, Weches Fingernail
Impressed, and Coles Creek Incised; Williams Plain ceramics also are found. During Period 2
(A.D. 1100â1300), ceramic types shift to Sanders Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Sanders
Plain, and Canton Incised; Williams Plain makes up a smaller part of the assemblage than
previously.

Arrow points for the Early Caddo period as a whole include Alba, Bonham,

Catahoula, and Scallorn (Thurmond 1990:226â227).

The Middle Caddo period in the western Cypress Creek basin is seen as being transitional from
the Early Caddo Period 2 to the Late Caddo Whelan phase. Thurmond identifies only 14 sites for
this period, all of which are found in the upper reaches of Big Cypress Creek. Ceramic types
identified for this period include Ripley Engraved, Avery Engraved, Canton Incised, Maydelle
Incised, Bullard Brushed, Pease Brushed-Incised, and La Rue Neck-Banded. Projectile point
types found during this period are Bonham, Catahoula, Alba, Perdiz, and Clifton (Thurmond
1990:227â228).

The eastern and western portions of the Cypress Creek basin show distinct differences in material
culture during the Late Caddo period, with a dividing line close to the western end of Caddo
Lake. In the eastern side of the basin, the Late Caddo period includes the Bossier and Belcher
phases, while in the western side of the basin (which includes Lake Oâ the Pines) are the Whelan
(A.D. 1350â1430) and Titus (A.D. 1430â1680) phases. Thurmond (1990) labels the western group
the Cypress cluster.

He believes this represents the formation of a distinct social group,

equivalent to the Kadohadacho and Hasinai confederacies known ethnographically (Thurmond
1985).

18

The Whelan phase is the earlier temporal phase identified for the Cypress cluster. Engraved
ceramics from Whelan phase sites consist primarily of Ripley Engraved, with smaller amounts of
Taylor Engraved and Wilder Engraved. Motifs observed on Ripley Engraved ceramics include
the scroll, scroll and circle, alternating nested triangle, horizontal diamond, and bisected diamond,
with the border elements usually being filled with curvilinear hachures. Utility wares from this
period are significantly different from Early Caddo utility wares. Body sherds are about equally
divided between brushed and plain ceramics, while other treatments, such as incising, punctation,
fingernail-impression, and red-filming, become minor parts of the assemblage. Brushed ceramics
are about equally divided between Bullard Brushed and Pease Brushed-Incised; plain-bodied
vessels are primarily classified as Maydelle Incised, and La Rue Neck-Banded pottery is
uncommon. Arrow points typical of this period are Perdiz and Scallorn (Thurmond 1990:228).

The succeeding Titus phase represents the final prehistoric occupation of the upper Cypress
Creek basin. The engraved ceramics are still dominated by Ripley Engraved, although Taylor
Engraved and Wilder Engraved are more common than in the Whelan phase, and two new types,
Bailey Engraved and Johns Engraved, appear. A new motif for Ripley Engraved, the pendant
triangle, appears to be limited to this phase. Border elements change from the curvilinear
hachures of the Whelan phase to broad, deeply excised areas. Specialized ceramics, such as
Killough Pinched jars, zoomorphic effigy bowls, and noded rattle bowls become more common
during the Titus phase. Utility wares also underwent a great deal of change from the preceding
period. Brushed ceramics are reduced in frequency compared to the Whelan phase, and a new
decorative element, appliquÃ©, is introduced. Pease Brushed-Incised virtually disappears from the
assemblage, while Maydelle Incised is found in slightly reduced frequencies as compared to the
Whelan phase, and La Rue Neck-Banded remains constant. Two new types, Harleton AppliquÃ©
and a type similar to McKinney Plain, are introduced during this period. Extensive trade contacts
with the McCurtain phase to the north are indicated by the occurrence of Avery Engraved, Bowie
Engraved, Cass AppliquÃ©, and Simms Engraved ceramics at Titus phase sites. Similar contacts
with the Belcher phase to the east appear to be limited to the adjacent sites of the Titus phase.
Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points continue into the Titus phase, and Bassett, Maud, Reed, and
Talco points are introduced (Thurmond 1990:228â229).

19

Thurmond (1990:229â233) has defined four regional subclusters within the Titus phaseâThree
Basins, Tankersley Creek, Swauano Creek, and Big Cypress Creek.
hypothesized to represent discrete social groups.

These subclusters are

The Big Cypress Creek subcluster is

concentrated at Lake Oâ the Pines, with two outliers found to the south along Little Cypress
Creek and the Sabine River. Engraved ceramics characteristic of this subcluster consist primarily
of Ripley Engraved and Taylor Engraved; Bailey Engraved, Johns Engraved, and Wilder
Engraved are relatively insignificant. Decorative motifs seen on Ripley Engraved ceramics are
mostly of the pendant triangle type, although the scroll, scroll and circle, and circle and
continuous scroll are not uncommon. Bullard Brushed and Karnack Brushed-Incised are the
dominant types of utilitarian ceramics, and Harleton AppliquÃ©, Maydelle Incised, and the
McKinney Plain-like ceramics are less common than in the other subclusters. Belcher phase
trade vessels are also present, especially at the easternmost sites. The primary arrow point is the
Talco, although Maud and Bassett points are also present.

The Titus phase is somewhat imprecisely dated from ca. A.D. 1450 to perhaps as late as A.D. 1680
(Thurmond 1990; Perttula 1992; Perttula et al. 1997).

This evidence includes the reputed

recovery by a private collector of glass beads from a burial at the Tracey site (41CP71), which is
a part of the Big Cypress subcluster, and the discovery of the Wichita ceramic types Womack
Engraved and Womack Plain from the Culpepper (41HP1) and the W. A. Ford (41TT2) sites of
the Three Basins subcluster (Scurlock 1962; Thurmond 1990:233).

Thurmond (1990:233)

believes that, considering the large number of Titus phase burials investigated over the years, the
dearth of historic material indicates a real decline in the Titus phase and an abandonment of the
western Cypress Creek basin prior to the beginning of the historic period.

Thurmondâs (1990:233) reconstruction is that the people represented by the Cypress cluster were
reduced by disease in the Protohistoric period, with the result that, by the time the Spanish and
French became permanently established in the area, the upper Cypress Creek basin had been
abandoned. He identifies the Cypress cluster with the Lacane, a group visited by the de Soto
expedition in 1542. The Spanish exposed the Lacane to a variety of diseases to which they had
no resistance. Such diseases have been suggested to have had significant impacts upon other
groups in the Southeast (Dobyns 1983; Dye 1989; Murray 1989:49; Perttula et al. 1986:186â189;
Smith 1989). Following this episode, the remnants of the Lacane left the area and took refuge
with the Hasinai and/or the Kadohadacho confederacies.
20

Historic Caddoan Period
The Historic Caddo period (A.D. 1680â1860) began with the founding of La Salleâs short-lived
French colony on the Texas coast and ended with the expulsion of the Caddo from Texas in 1859.
During the closing decades of the seventeenth century, French explorers (including the Sieur de
Tonti, Bienville, and St. Denis) traveled through the upper Red River valley and made contact
with the Native Americans residing in the area. By 1854, they were residing, along with other
Native American groups, on a tract of land on the Brazos River in Northcentral Texas.
Subsequently, they were moved north to Indian Territory in 1859 (Swanton 1946:99).

Displaced Native Americans from east of the Mississippi River began to move into Caddo
territory in Spanish Texas. These movements were in response to the increasing pressure to give
up their traditional livelihoods and become incorporated into Anglo-American culture (Everett
1990). The Spanish initially welcomed these groups with the idea of using them to create a
âbufferâ between the Spanish settlements in Texas and the land-hungry Anglo-Americans.
Unfortunately, as more of these groups (such as the Choctaw, Delaware, Quapaw, Shawnee,
Cherokee, and Alabama-Koasati) moved into East Texas, they began to increasingly compete
with the Caddo for a diminishing resource base. This problem was exacerbated following the sale
of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, when Anglo-Americans began moving into Northeast
Texas as well (Perttula 1988:21), and was not ultimately resolved until both the Caddo and most
of the immigrant groups were expelled following the Texas Revolution of 1835.

European and American Historical Background
The period of European exploration and settlement and the subsequent Anglo-American and
African-American development of Northeast Texas are briefly covered in the remaining portions
of this chapter. For more extensive treatments of this period in Northeast Texas, see Peter and
Cliff (1990:Chapters 3 and 7) and Peter et al. (1991:Appendix J).

The initial European penetration into the general area of Northeast Texas occurred in the middle
of the sixteenth century when the survivors of the de Soto entrada, led by LuÃ­s de Moscoso de
Alvarado, entered Texas in their attempt to reach New Spain by land (Bruseth and Kenmotsu
1991; Weddle 1985). Recent reconstructions of the Moscoso route through Texas (Bruseth and
21

Kenmotsu 1991) equate the province of Naguatex with the Hatchel-Mitchell-Moores site complex
in northern Bowie County, suggesting that from there the entrada moved southwest through
Bowie County to cross the Sulphur River somewhere in the vicinity of Douglassville, where
Wright Patman Lake now is located.
Following the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into
Northeast Texas intensified, although for a number of years it was not clear who actually owned
the area south of the Red River. The United States considered it (and indeed, most of Texas) to
be part of Louisiana and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939). Spain
(and later Mexico), on the other hand, was violently opposed to this view, and at several times
during the first few decades of the nineteenth century, the dispute nearly led to war (Smith 1991).
The first official Anglo-American penetration of the region was by the Freeman-Curtis
Expedition of 1806, which was turned back at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a Spanish
military force (Flores 1984).
Despite Spainâs claim, Northeast Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the
Anglo-American sphere of influence, and settlement continued. The earliest settlements were
confined to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed
into the prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Trammelâs Trace and Daytonâs
Road. Trammelâs Trace, a popular immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur
River at Eppersonâs Ferry and continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs,
founded in 1839, and then south to cross Cypress Creek two miles west of Jefferson (Webb and
Carroll 1952:2:793â794). Daytonâs Road was a major east-west overland route that ran along the
divide between the Sulphur and Red rivers.
The original Anglo-American settlers in Northeast Texas were apparently largely subsistence
farmers residing on small holdings, with an economy reportedly based on grain and livestock
production (Peter and Cliff 1990:36). The commercial production of cotton apparently was not
introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach 1968), a shift that was accompanied by increasing
numbers of slaves in the region. The town of Jefferson, on Cypress Creek, was a major cotton
market, and the ante-bellum planters throughout the region undoubtedly sent their cotton there for
sale (Peter and Cliff 1990:39). Other major industries established about the same time included
tan yards and syrup mills; after 1857, railroad construction also progressed westward (Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:198, 2:59).
22

The sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of Northeast Texas lay with the
secessionist southerners. After all, a majority of them had immigrated from the South, the region
as a whole had a substantial slave population, and the cash economy of the area was built on
slave-based agriculture. Bowie, Cass, Marion, and Upshur counties all voted for secession in
1861, and in most of Northeast Texas anti-Union feelings ran high (Webb and Carroll
1952:1:306).

Northeast Texas escaped serious, direct effects from the Civil War, being too far from the centers
of fighting to the east and south to be affected by Union forces, and too far east of the frontier to
be affected by the resurgence of Native American problems that accompanied the withdrawal of
United States and Texas military forces (Pool 1975:110â113). The defeat of the South in 1865
brought with it the end of slavery in Texas and the breakdown of the old slave-based plantation
system and the presence of a Union army of occupation. The end of slavery brought many
changes in the economy of rural East Texas. Lacking the cheap and dependable labor resources
provided by slavery, the large plantations of the prewar period ceased to be economically feasible
and many were broken up and partially sold off. Most of the land put on the market found its
way into the hands of speculators and investors, with the result that a new system of
sharecropping or tenant farming replaced the old plantation system. Productive land was now
often held by absentee landlords with the labor supplied by African-American or poor AngloAmerican sharecroppers or tenants.

Although this system failed to improve the lot of the

sharecroppers and tenants, it was a successful replacement for the prewar system, and by the
beginning of the twentieth century, sharecroppers or tenants operated the bulk of the rural farms
in Northeast Texas.

After 1870, the population of Northeast Texas began to increase and the region began to recover
from the worst effects of the war and the subsequent recession. One of the most important factors
in this recovery was the increasing role of the railroad in the regional economy. A small amount
of railroad construction had occurred prior to the outbreak of the war, when more than 50 miles of
track had been laid westward from Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific
Railroad. Following the end of the war, construction did not resume for four more years. When
it finally did, it continued at a relatively steady rate. In 1871 and 1872, the Texas and Pacific
Railroad went through the southern corner of Upshur County and the eastern portion of Cass and
Marion counties. In 1876, the East Line and Red River Railroad (later part of the Louisiana and
23

Arkansas), building west from Jefferson, crossed western Marion County and the southwest
portion of Cass County.

New towns sprang up along these railroad routes and developed as important shipping centers
(Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). The continuing expansion of the railroads after 1870, and the
improved communications they brought, spurred the development of other local industries as
well. During this period, lumbering assumed its place as an important industry in many areas of
Northeast Texas (Chandler 1937). Sawmills to process this lumber also sprang up throughout
Northeast Texas and provided another major source of employment (Webb and Carroll
1952:2:824). All of these mills helped supply raw material to factories located in Texarkana and
in other large towns (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198).

In spite of the steady growth in nonagricultural industries during these years, farming continued
to be important in Northeast Texas, with the small, owner-operated farm still prominent. Despite
the inequities of the sharecropper and tenant systems, the participants were not locked into the
system as had been the case under slavery, and in the last three decades of the nineteenth century
increasing numbers of African-Americans achieved the status of small landowners. They often
settled in dispersed rural communities separate from those of their white neighbors.

Between about 1920 and 1935, the rural population seems to have generally declined, although
the population of the region as a whole continued to grow (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198). Some
factors that may have influenced this demographic shift were the continued growth of urban
industries, the declining agricultural productivity of the land, and the depressed regional and
national economy. The discovery of oil in Cass, Marion, and Upshur counties in the 1930s led to
the development of new industries and increased employment, although the overall population of
the region continued to fall (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306, 2:144, 783).

The period following the end of World War II has been one of general prosperity and
urbanization for the entire region. Demographic changes within this area have been dominated
by the growth of medium-sized urban areas such as Texarkana and Marshall. Commercial
patterns in the region have benefited from the construction of several major interstate highways
(I-20 and I-30) that have served to link the area to major manufacturing centers to both the east
and the west. The improved infrastructure, as well as the construction of several lakes in the area,
24

also has brought increased prosperity in the form of tourism and the recreational dollar. In spite
of this growth, agriculture, livestock, and timber continue to play a major role in the regional
economy (Fox 1980:1).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Many previous cultural resources investigations have been conducted in Northeast Texas;
however, only five are located within 1 mile of any of the three project areas.

Two road surveys were conducted within 1 mile of the project areas: State Highway 154
southeast of FM 2208 to Loop 390 in 1975, and State Highway 154 widening from Loop 390 to 1
mile west in 1995 for the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation, and for the
Texas Department of Transportation, respectively. No sites were recorded as a result of either
survey (THC Site Atlas 2007).

In 2002 GMI conducted a cultural resources investigation of 10 well pad locations and an access
road in Harrison County, Texas. All of the project areas were located on upland hill sides or hill
tops characterized by generally shallow Tertiary age sandy soils underlain by dense yellowish or
red clay subsoil.

One new site, 41HS831, a nineteenth- and early twentieth-century

homestead/farmstead was recorded (Cooper et al. 2002).

Avoidance of the site was

recommended.

In 2005, URS conducted a 448.8-acre intensive cultural resources inventory of the Proposed
North Lansing Storage Expansion Project (Tucker 2005) (the current North Lansing NSS
project). Three possible cairn sites (41HS856, 41HS857, and 41HS858) were recorded. In the
fall of 2006, GMI was asked to review these three sites. A letter from GMI submitted to
Titanium Environmental Services in December 2006 stated the investigation determined the three
sites were natural outcrops of red ironstone and not cultural. The Texas Historical Commission
concurred with the assessment made by GMI.

METHODS

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Archeologists reviewed the Texas Historical Commissionâs Texas Archeological Site Atlas, the
database of previously recorded sites, before fieldwork commenced. Based on the results of the
atlas search, no previously recorded sites were identified within 1 mile of the project areas. A
search of the Texas Historic Overlay Database (2007) was conducted and one map of Harrison
County depicting house locations, the 1911 Carter and Cook Map of Harrison County, Texas, was
located and examined. No structures were depicted in any of the current project areas. The
current Longview Heights and Marshall West topographic maps of the project areas were also
reviewed before fieldwork began. No structures were depicted in the current project areas.

FIELD METHODS
Two archeologists conducted pedestrian survey and shovel testing during two days of field work
in February 2007. Due to the upland context, the project areas were considered to have a low
probability for containing prehistoric archeological sites, though resources of historic age were
possible. The three project areas were surveyed using judgmental shovel tests. Area A (G-1A)
was tested using a single transect of judgmental shovel tests on each side of the existing corridor,
with additional shovel tests near a possible historic homesite (Area A-1). Shovel tests were
excavated on each side of the two intermittent drainages crossing Area A.

Area B (H-1

Launcher) was a 300-x-100-ft area in which two judgmental shovel tests spaced approximately 30

26

meters (m) apart were excavated. Area C (200-x-60-ft area at MP 0.0) was tested with one shovel
test because most of the area was impacted by previous construction of two pipelines, an access
road, and a telephone line corridor.

All shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and were excavated to at least 10 cm into the B
Horizon unless groundwater was encountered. Shovel tests were excavated in arbitrary 20-cm
levels while also following soil stratigraphy when observed. The soil color, texture, and depth for
all shovel tests were recorded on shovel tests forms using Munsell color notations. All sediments
were screened through 0.25-inch (0.64-mm) hardware cloth and examined for cultural materials.
The conditions of all three project areas including observed disturbances were documented with
digital photography, and field notes were taken.

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

Intensive archeological survey and shovel testing were conducted in the three distinct project
areas (A, B, and C; Figures 3, 4, and 5, see Figures 1 and 2). Shovel tests were not excavated in
areas that had been visibly impacted or in areas of standing water.

AREA A
Area A begins at the compressor station on a hill at 370 ft amsl and trends down a gentle hill to
the east (Figures 6 and 7). The vegetation is planted pine trees on the sides of the corridor and
manicured grass within the corridor. Area A-1 is located on the south side of the existing corridor
just east of an isolated wetland (ISW-1; Figure 8). Area A-1 was examined for evidence of a
historic homesite in response to the Kinder Morgan Preconstruction Inspection Report stating,
âvegetation near ISW-1 suggests a possible home site was located in the areaâ (2007). This
vegetation includes large oak trees, lawn grass, and jonquils (Daniel Johns, personal
communication 2007). No evidence of a homesite (e.g., foundation, trash, cultural material,
jonquils, or other indication) beyond the vegetation of oak trees and lawn grass was observed
during this investigation. No cultural material was observed in the shovel test excavated in Area
A-1.

To the east of Area A-1, on the north side of the corridor, a pond has been created with an earthen
berm on the southeast side (Figure 9). An intermittent drainage (300 ft amsl) flows from the pond
through a drainage pipe, under an access road. The access road runs along the north side of the

existing corridor. The drainage continues southeast across the corridor, flowing east into a
tributary of Moccasin Creek (Figure 10). The drainage is very small and has no banks to
examine. The water trickles through the grass planted in the existing pipeline corridor and into
the planted pines on the south side of the corridor. Shovel tests were excavated to the east and
west of the drainage on the north and south sides of the corridor. The soil profiles did not contain
any soils indicating the presence of cultural materials or buried paleosols. The topography of the
existing corridor rises eastward, crossing FM 2208, and continues east on the south end of a small
hill, trending down again to another intermittent drainage (280 ft amsl), a tributary of Moccasin
Creek (Figures 11 and 12). This drainage is also very small, and the water trickles through grass
planted in the corridor; however, on the south side of the corridor, a small bank was observed and
examined. The profile of the bank consisted of red clay subsoil from top to bottom. The shovel
tests excavated to the east and west of the drainage on the south side of the corridor also consisted
of red clay subsoil with a thin stratum (less than 5 cm) of organic duff at the surface. Excavation
of shovel tests on the north side of the corridor near the drainage was precluded by the presence
of an erosional gully, displaying a similar profile of red clay, along the south side of an old twotrack farm road. The topography rises back up to the end of the project area (290 ft amsl) (Figure
13). A total of 26 judgmental shovel tests was excavated in the planted pine along the edges of
the existing corridor in Area A, including four shovel tests in Area A-1. No cultural material was
observed. No evidence of soils likely to contain cultural materials was observed in the banks or
in shovel tests adjacent to the drainages.

AREA B
Area B is located to the southeast of Forest Hill Church, southeast of the intersection of FM 449
and FM 2879. The area is upland pasture with an intermittent drainage located 1,500 ft to the
south. Area B was surveyed as a northwest extension of the H-1 Launcher Site (see Figures 1 and
4). Area B covers a 300-x-100-ft area of the southwest corner of a pasture bounded by a barbed
wire fence and property line to the south and Forest Hill Road to the west (Figure 14). Two
shovel tests were excavated in Area B approximately 30 m apart. No cultural material was
observed.

AREA C
Area C is a 200-x-60-ft area at MP 0.0 located on the west side of State Highway 154 just south
of the intersection of two pipeline corridors, northwest of Marshall, Texas (see Figures 2 and 5).
Area C is in the uplands with an intermittent drainage 750 ft to the south. Due to previous
impacts from the construction of two pipelines, an access road, and telephone line corridor, most
of Area C has been disturbed; however, one shovel test was excavated in a wooded section of
Area C (Figure 15). No cultural material was observed.

SUMMARY
Because of the upland environment of the project area, as well as the small, shallow, intermittent
drainages and the recent development and construction, particularly in Area C, it is unlikely that
the project areas would contain any subsurface archeological deposits with contextual integrity.
No cultural materials were found during the shovel testing, the pedestrian survey of Area A-1, or
in the creek banks.

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

The archeological investigations documented in the report were undertaken with three primary
goals in mind:

1. To locate all historic and prehistoric cultural resources occurring within the designated
project areas.
2. To evaluate the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP.
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of those resources in relation to the proposed
construction based on their NRHP evaluations.

Archeological investigations documented in this report consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel
testing of three project areas (Areas A, B, and C). The field effort involved the excavation of a
total of 29 shovel tests in the three areas and pedestrian survey in addition to shovel testing of a
possible historic homesite just east of ISW-1. No archeological resources were identified during
the survey. The proposed project would have no effect on historic properties. No further
archeological investigations are recommended.
