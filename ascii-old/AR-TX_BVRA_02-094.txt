ABSTRACT
Archaeological investigations at the John W. Coulter residence in Bryan, Texas
was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas in
September 2001 at the request of the City of Bryan. The work was performed under
Antiquities Permit 2694 with William E. Moore the Principal Investigator. This study
involved mechanical stripping of an area with a gradall to expose the subsurface where
pre-1870 historic features might be present. The potential of such features is based on
the presence of a 19th century structure on the property that may have been
constructed between 1867 and 1870.
This investigation revealed the presence of "plow scars." These scars were
observed to be oriented at 40 degrees east of north, a pattern not consistent with the
current orientation of the city block as currently platted. This indicates that the area was
cultivated prior to platting at the City of Bryan and prior to construction of the original
John W. Coulter residence in the 19th century.
One historic feature, a small, amorphous trash dump containing glass, metal,
ceramics, brick, and animal bone was observed as a result of this investigation. The
artifacts in this shallow, amorphous deposit date to the early 20th century. They were
not collected.
It is concluded that the area examined was probably used as a pasture
throughout the occupation of this site. This use, apparently post-dating cultivation of the
tract, is confirmed by a verbal description of the block by an earlier resident of the area.
This informant stated that part of the current project area was used as pasture for a
cow. There was a small pond in the pasture area, but its location has not been
identified.
Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and the Texas
Department of Transportation in Austin Texas, and BVRA in Bryan, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Bryan proposes to construct a visitor center on a tract of land that
contains two standing structures dating to the 19th century and the footprint of a more
recent house that was constructed in 1903 by John William Coulter, a prominent Bryan
businessman. The site of the current project area occupies Block 51 bounded by
William J. Bryan Parkway on the north, 26th Street on the south, Preston Street on the
east, and Houston Street on the west. Funding will be provided by the Statewide
Transportation Enhancement Program through the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT). Construction of the visitor and parking lot will be restricted to the eastern half
of Block 51, an area that remains open and undeveloped. It is this area that is the focus
of this study.
It is the intent of the City of Bryan to integrate the standing structures into the
visitor center complex. The original house and the carriage house have been restored
by descendants of the Coulter family. The carriage house will be an integral part of the
visitor center as it will contain displays that will interpret modes of transportation from
1880 to the present. The purpose of the museum will be to educate visitors as to the
part the carriage house played in the surface transportation system and how that
system evolved. Other transportation related displays would also be utilized to enhance
this central theme. The footprint of the 1903 house built by Mr. Coulter will be
preserved, and a dry rock wall will be placed along the footprint in order to define the
limits of this house. The site of the project area and its location within Brazos County is
depicted in Figure 1.
It is important to note here that the city block with its two 19th century structures
have been deemed eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places by the
State Historic Preservation Officer, Texas Historical Commission. Since state funding is
being made available for this project, it was requested by TxDOT that the area where
construction is planned must be examined to locate any significant historic features that
may be present. In order to satisfy this requirement, the City of Bryan contracted with
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) to perform a subsurface survey of the
project area and make recommendations regarding any future work that may be
necessary prior to construction of the visitor center. Block 51 as it appears today, with
the exception of the 1912 structure now demolished, showing the area of proposed
construction is depicted in Figure 2.

METHODS
Prior to this investigation a "desk top" survey was performed by BVRA (Moore
2001). This study reviewed and integrated information collected by various researchers
interested in the history of the buildings that once occupied Block 51. These reports
contain information taken from the County Courthouse (deed records), City of Bryan
library archives, Texas A&M University archives, Brazos County Appraisal District,
Brazos County Tax Assessor's Office, and interviews with Brazos County Heritage
Society members. The results of this research appears in the Results and Conclusions
section below.
Soil data on the site were obtained from a geotechnical investigation of the
proposed construction area by Buchanan/Soil Mechanics, Inc. of Bryan, Texas. The
location of these soil borings are shown in Figure 2. In addition, the project area was
examined by the Principal Investigator and draftsperson in order to collect data used (in
conjunction with other maps drafted by previous researchers) to create the project area
map depicted in this report.
The methods employed during the current subsurface survey involved the use of
a gradall that stripped the soil away to expose the subsurface where historic features
may be present. The presence of features is the primary target of this investigation
rather than an occupational surface. The area of proposed construction was not
flagged in the field. Therefore, the field crew, utilizing the project area map, scaled off a
larger, inclusive area to be investigated that includes the entire construction site (Figure
3). The soil was stripped away from the grassy pasture in thin slices from the surface
into the underlying, undisturbed natural clay (Figure 4). The depth of this stripping was
not consistent and varied within the project area between 10 and 25 cm. A monitor with
experience in urban archaeology was present during this process. Prior to the
mechanical stripping, an exploratory trench was excavated to a depth of 50 cm in order
to define the sequence of fill deposition (if any) and the depth of natural soil (Figure 5).
A typical soil profile was photographed and drawn. The drafted version of this profile
appears as Figure 6.
One feature, a trash dump, was encountered. This feature is described in this
report as Feature 1, and its location was plotted on the project area map (Figure 3).
The artifacts were inventoried in the field and not collected.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Boonville, the site of the first county seat in Brazos County, was located
approximately two miles northeast of the present town of Bryan. This town was
established in 1841 and remained prosperous until 1866 when the railroad was built in
Bryan. The residents of Boonville voted at that time to move the county seat to Bryan.
Today the site of Boonville is marked by a cemetery and a Texas Centennial monument
(Webb 1952:188). The town of Bryan lies at the junction of the Texas and New Orleans
and the International Great Northern railroads in an area settled by Stephen F. Austin's
colonists along the Brazos River between 1821 and 1831. The town was founded in
1865 when William Joel Bryan donated land for the town site (Webb 1952:234).
Previous archaeological projects involving significant historic sites in Brazos
County are restricted to two investigations at the Richard Carter site (41BZ74) in
College Station in the 1980s (Carlson 1983, 1987). The Carter site represents the
"earliest historic settlement within the corporate limits of College Station" (Carlson
1983:iii) at circa 1831. The site remained with the same family until 1883.
This study, therefore, is the third archaeological investigation of a historic site
following the two previous studies at the Carter site by Ms. Carlson.
The early history of Block 51 is somewhat confusing. According to one source
(Hawthorne 1991), the Coulter house began as a seven-room structure built by Thomas
D. Harrison who apparently paid taxes on this property in 1869. This description of the
house conflicts with that provided by Grots et al. (1991) in that they state the house
began as a two-room structure. It is known, however, that John William Coulter was
living there by the early 1870s with his family. According to Grots et al. (1991), this
structure was expanded, probably in the 1870s, as a room was added to the north
creating a three-room building. Sometime in the 1890s, the one room addition and half
of the original dog-run was demolished leaving the enclosed breezeway and the other
half of the dog-run (Grots et al. 1991). Thus, the integrity of this significant structure,
now referred to as a remnant house, has been compromised. The original house as it
appears today following restoration by the descendants of the Coulter family is depicted
in Figure 7.
A carriage house was constructed to the northwest of the original house about
1888 on the northwest corner of the property. No information was found regarding the
history of this structure. In a detailed study of this building by Hawthorne et al. (1991)
the hypothesis was made that some of the wood used in its construction may have
come from the original 1860s house, possibly about the time it was moved to make
room for the 1903 house discussed below. Figure 8 depicts the carriage house as it
appears today following restoration by the descendants of the Coulter family.

The Coulter family outgrew the small residence, and a new house was
constructed by the architectural firm Wemyss-Smith in Waco. To make room for the
new house, the original structure was moved "back, out of the way of the new house
under construction" (Hawthorne 1991:8) where it continued to house servants. It seems
likely that the original house was located within the current footprint of the 1903 house.
This argument seems to be supported by the presence of a cistern within the footprint of
the 1903 structure (Figure 2). Alternately, it is possible that the cistern was built to
serve the 1903 house. In this instance the cistern would have underlain the floor of the
home and water would have been accessed by a hand pump.
The 1903 house is much better documented than the original dog-run building.
Several photographs of it are on file at the Bryan Public Library, and the lot is depicted
on the 1912 Sanborn Insurance Map. According to a study conducted by the
Department of Architecture and the Historic Imaging Laboratory, Texas A&M University
(1992:4), the 1903 house had three cisterns. This structure was moved from its original
location (Block 51) to the Gay Hill community in Fayette County, Texas in 1975 where it
remains today.
An inspection of the area by the current field crew located two cisterns (Figure 2),
and some bricks obscured by grass that may represent the third cistern (not depicted).
Following the restoration of the remnant house by a local firm at the expense of
the Coulter family descendants, a cistern was located and capped (Figure 2). Also, the
location of a recently demolished privy adjacent to the remnant house (Figure 2) has
been identified (Hawthorne et al. 1991:2). A field inspection by the current field crew
located a depression that is believed to be the site of the privy (Figure 2).
The extensive research conducted for this project has not revealed any evidence
of historic utilization of the area that will be affected by construction of the visitor center.
A verbal description of the block by an earlier resident of the area states that after the
1903 house was built the smaller house was occupied by a servant with fence lines
separating the block into quadrants. The quadrant on the northeast corner was used as
pasture for a cow that was milked in the stall on the north side of the carriage house.
There was a small pond in the pasture area, but its location has not been identified.
Following the removal of the 1903 house, City Block 51 has remained idle until
renovation of the remnant house by the Coulter family.
A geotechnical investigation of the proposed construction area was conducted by
Buchanan/Soil Mechanics, Inc. of Bryan, Texas on July 18, 2001. Three cores were
bored in the area. The logs of these borings reveal essentially undisturbed natural soil
at the surface and offer no evidence of fill deposition at the site. The absence of
evidence for extensive near-surface disturbance suggests that there is reasonable
potential for intact archaeological deposits.

In the earlier assessment by BVRA (Moore 2001) Block 51 was divided into two
areas to be considered prior to construction of the visitor center. They are the site of
the remnant house, existing carriage house, and footprint of the 1903 house (Area A)
and the unimproved section outside the fence line of the 1903 house that will house the
museum and parking lot (Area B). Area A will be affected by construction of foot paths,
historical markers, trees and shrubs, and a dry rock wall outlining the footprint of the
1903 house site.
Area B, however, will be permanently altered through construction of the
museum (including restrooms) and parking lot. Based on the archival work that has
been conducted to date it was the opinion of BVRA that Area A is the only portion of
Block 51 that contained standing structures. It seemed likely that all cisterns and privies
are located in this area as well. Therefore, it was hypothesized that there is a moderate
probability that pre-1870 features exist within Area B. An example of a class of feature
that may be found at a greater distance from the residences and within Area B are trash
pits. It seems probable that the presence of any previous structures in either Area A or
Area B would have been identified through the archival work conducted by the various
researchers.
Subsurface Survey
In general, that portion of Block 51 investigated represents an area that was used
for pasture. Oral history mentions the northeast portion of the project area used as a
pasture and a milk cow as well as a pond in the area. The mechanical stripping did not
reveal any evidence that a pond was present. What it did reveal was the presence of
plow scars throughout the area investigated. They occur at intervals of approximately 1
m and are oriented at 40 degrees east of North. The direction of the plow scars
suggests that the area had been in cultivation prior to the platting of Block 51 and the
documented usage of the area as pasture. These scars are illustrated in a photograph
of Trench 1 (Figure 5), the soil profile drawing (Figure 6), and a photograph of the soil
profile (Figure 9).
A small, amorphous trash dump was found at 37 cm below the existing ground
surface. It extended to 46 cm at its deepest point (Figure 3). The size of this feature
was measured at 80 x 270 cm. The majority of artifacts were concentrated in the
western third of the feature, and the artifact density tapered off toward the east. The
feature was located in a sandy matrix bounded on the north and east by clays with more
sterile sand to the south and west. It contained pieces of concrete, terra cotta pottery, a
round nail, window glass, snuff bottle fragments, beer bottle fragments, milky white
glass (Ponds jar) ceramics (probably plates), animal bone, and modern brick fragments.
The artifacts date to the early 20th century and are not significant. Two segments of
modern, but not currently used, sewer pipe were located. They are also not significant.
Three meters south of Feature 5 modern bricks and brick fragments were
observed. These appear to be an area where bricks were discarded, and they were not
identified as a feature.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No features dating to 1870 or earlier were identified as a result of this
investigation. It is, therefore, recommended that construction of the visitor center and
parking lot be allowed to proceed as currently planned.
