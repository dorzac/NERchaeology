Description of Location:
From the intersection of CR2471 and CR2472 travel 1.7 kilometers north on CR2472. Site is located in a clearing on

Environmental/Topographical Setting:
Site is topographically situated on a terrace that gradually slopes to the west where an unnamed natural spring is
located. Overstory within the site included oak, black walnut, osage, and pine. Numerous small grasses were
observed in the eastern portion of the site where land clearing activities had removed a majority of the natural
overstory.

Discussion of Site:
According to a local informant, the site is the early to mid twentieth century homestead of a Mr. Boster Chapman.
During the survey no intact features were identified. It appears the site was razed when USACE acquired the property
(ca. 1957). A total of seven shovel tests were excavated in order to determine site size and cultural resource deposition.
A total of 98 artifacts were collected between 0-60 cmbs in six of the seven shovel tests excavated. The site is located

Site contains the remains of a razed early to mid twentieth century homestead. The site has a low research value
based on the low integrity of the sites historic component that was documented during shovel test excavations.
Further Investigations:
Based on the overall low integrity of the sites cultural component additional archaeological work is not
recommended.

The presence of lithic, non-diagnostic ceramics, and FCR suggests the site is a campsite of undetermined age. The
site could potentially provide data that specifically that can help answer research themes such as prehistoric human
subsistence and adaptation that specifically relate to the Caddo that settled along the Sulphur River drainage.
However, additional testing is needed to determine if intact buried deposits are present.
Further Investigations:
Additional testing is necessary to determine the sites NRHP eligibility status.

would have been the NW corner of a structure that was probably razed by USACE in the 1950's. The chimney was
comprised of large tabular pieces of local sandstone (approximately 50-x-30cm in size) held together with a white
sandy paste mortar. The chimney measured 1.5-x-1.5m and was 1.2m high.

approximately 5m below the surface.

twentieth century. Two feature (i.e., chimney, well) were recorded within the site during the survey. Seven shovel tests
were excavated in order to determine site size and cultural resource deposition. A total of 57 artifacts were recovered in
four of the seven shovel tests excavated. A wooden fence comprised of railroad tie uprights with 2-x-7 inch wooden side
boards was encountered in the NE portion of the site. On aerial imagery the site is located on the SE edge of a
60-x-30m cleared field that was probably used as an agricultural field by the sites former occupants. The site is located
immediately south and adjacent to CR2464. This portion of the road has been abandoned and overgrown with
vegetation since the USACE acquired the property in the late 1950's.

The analysis of artifacts recovered during shovel test excavations suggests the site is an early to mid twentieth century
homestead. Two features (i.e., well, collapsed chimney) were identified in the central portion of the site during the
survey. Six shovel tests were excavated in oder to ascertain site size and cultural resource deposition. A total of 22
artifacts were recovered in five of the six shovel tests excavated. On aerial imagery the site is located on the northwest
edge of a 100 x 400 meter area that has been cleared of trees and could have been used as an agricultural field by the
historic inhabitants of the site. One SW-NE running 2-track road was recorded southeast and adjacent to the site.

Discussion of Site:
No cultural features were encountered during the survey. Six shovel tests were excavated in order to access the sites
boundary and cultural resource deposition. The site was previously described as a prehistoric campsite with numerous
lithic artifacts (1994 Archeological Data Site Form). However, no artifacts were encountered on the surface of the site
during the survey or below the surface during excavations. In all likelyhood, the artifacts recorded in 1994 have since
been impacted by erosion.

Site is located in the west-central portion of USACE Lakeside Park 5 meters north of a E-W running asphalt road. On
the TARL-Atlas database the site is mapped at two locations in the park. According to the previous site report,
information provided by USACE Cultural Resource Manager, and site setting encountered during the survey, the

In order to inventory both proposed site locations within the park, the northern site location shown on the TARL-Atlas

subsurface disturbances noted. EComm recommends the northern site location shown within the TARL-Atlas database
be deleted based on the information generated during this survey (see above).

Description of Location:
Location described as 41MR103 on the TARL-Atlas database does not match the description provided in the original
1993 site data report . It appears the original site UTMs were taken using the NAD1983 datum (all USACE projects
are required to use NAD1983) and were then miss-plotted using the NAD1927 Datum without conversion, thus
causing a northerly displacement of ca. 200 meters. The true location of 41MR103 is ~200m south of the current
position shown within the TARL-Atlas database. During the survey, the true position was found to be 100% inundated
by 20-30 feet of water from Lake Wright Patman.
This site form describes the work conducted by EComm on the erroneous site location shown on the TARL-Atlas
website. EComm recommends the site location be moved to reflect this finding.

Discussion of Site:
The analysis of the artifacts recovered during shovel test excavations suggests the site was the location of an early to
mid twentieth century homestead. It appears the site was 100% razed when USACE acquired the property in the
1950's. No intact features were identified within the site during the survey. Six shovel tests were excavated in order to
determine site size and cultural resource deposition. A total of seven artifacts were recovered in three of the six shovel
tests. The remains of a SW-NE running 2-track road was identified within the central portion of the site during the
survey. The road has been abandoned and overgrown with vegetation since the construction of the lake by the Corps in
the late 1950's. The 1993 site data report on file at TARL mentions the presence of prehistoric artifacts within the site.
Prehistoric artifacts were not identified within the site during the current survey.

Discussion of Site:
Site is located on the beach of Lakeview Island. No artifacts were observed on the surface during the pedestrian
survey. Three shovel tests were excavated away from the site on an intact terrace deposit in order to determine if the
site boundaries extended to the south. No artifacts were recovered during excavations. Matrix within site is composed
of eroded terrace deposits which have been further impacted by the lakes waves.
