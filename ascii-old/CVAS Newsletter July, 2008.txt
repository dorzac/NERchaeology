Brownell Roberts, Arnetta Cooper,
and Christine Buckstead, will do a short
program on their visit to the Alibates Flint
Quarries National Monument while attending the TAS Field School last month at Perryton. For thousands of years, people came
to the red bluffs above the Canadian River
for flint that was vital to their existence. Alibates flint is a multi-colored stone with the
ability to hold a sharp edge. Prehistoric people needed raw materials for tools and
weapons, and Alibates flint was some of the
finest.

Archaeological Legacy Institute
Friends and colleagues: The life of an itinerant archaeological field technician alternates memorable thrills with
spells of boredom, proud accomplishment with tedious frustration, and takes lots of just plain work. See more
about how this plays out as the T-Bone saga of fieldwork life continues in Shovel Bum in Alaska, the latest video
feature on our nonprofit streaming-media Web site, The Archaeology Channel (http://
www.archaeologychannel.org).
Alaska is the setting for the fourth Shovel Bum e-zine extravaganza, featuring Trent DeBoer’s drawings and real
voice. T-Bone and friends have hired out for an archaeological survey at Cold Bay, on the tip the Alaska Peninsula. Their first task is to qualify at rifle-shooting as a precaution against the numerous and huge brown
bears. Braving this threat along with wolverines, gales, and floating bogs, T-Bone encounters Japanese fishing
floats and huge village sites, sips whisky at the local bar, and finally returns home to Betsy with his new long
beard.
This and other programs are available on TAC for your use and enjoyment. We urge you to support this public
service by participating in our Membership (http://www.archaeologychannel.org/member.html) and Underwriting
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org/sponsor.shtml) programs. Only with your help can we continue and enhance
our nonprofit public-education and visitor-supported programming. We also welcome new content partners as we
reach out to the world community.
