ARCHEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE OF PORTIONS OF
WALNUT AND LITTLE WALNUT CREEKS, AUSTIN, TEXAS
INTRODUCTION
During the week of February 25 through 29, 1980, at the
request of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth Dist­
rict, staff members of the Texas Archeological Survey, under
the field supervision of the author of this report, Terry
Seelinger, conducted an archeological reconnaissance of twelve
designated areas along Walnut and Little Walnut creeks, north
and east of Austin, Texas (see attached maps). The survey
procedure was a complete pedestrian inspection of the areas
wherever possible, with emphasis on the examination of creek
cutbanks for cultural material exposed by erosion. Zig-zag
transects were spaced from 10 to 20 meters apart, depending
on the width of the creek bank and the degree of modification.
In some sections, i.e. 9404 and 9412-9418, suburban develop­
ment has covered the original ground surface with fill and
has eliminated the possibility of locating any cultural mate~
rial surficially. In many places along these sections, back
yards of residences extend to the edge of the creek, preclud­
ing access and inspection. Photographs on file at the Texas
Archeological Survey illustrate on-going modifications along
the creek banks, including a front-end loader and dump truck
removing soil, and an example of one cutbank along Little
Walnut Creek where bulldozed fill overlays the original soil
horizon. No collections of cultural material were made.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The elevations in the areas surveyed range from 700 to 750
feet MSL in the upstream areas to 47~ to 500 feet in the
downstream sections. The upstream environmental setting is
characterized by slightly hilly terrain and frequent limestone
bedrock outcrops. Juniper, liveoak and native grasses are
1

the dominant vegetation. Downstream, the setting is primarily
densely overgrown creek terraces above deeply cut creek bottoms.
The central portion of Travis County is underlain by the
Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk and Taylor Marl, which form the
parent material for the. various soils in the survey areas.
In Sections 1017-1018, the dominant soils are those of the
Tarrant Series, characterized as shallow, stony and clayey
overlying, and with large exposures of, limestone (Soil Conser­
vation Service 1974). Much of this area has been extremely
modified by modern construction and development. Recent allu­
vium is present along Walnut Creek.
Sections 9412-9419 are listed as Urban land of the Austin,
Brackett, and Houston Black series. According to the Travis
County Soil Survey (Soil Conservation Service 1974: 29, 43),
approximately 85 percent of the Austin and Brackett soils
classified as Urban have been substantially altered or covered
by development, while on the Houston Black Series an estimated
60 percent have been so modified. The remaining Austin soils
are silty clays underlain by fractured chalk; the Brackett
soils are gravelly clay loams, underlain by interbedded lime­
stone and marl or by fractured chalk, and generally benched
by outcrops of the underlying material; the Houston Black
soils are deep clays underlain by calcareous marls, alluvial
clays and chalk. In addition, a narrow strip of recent allu­
vium is present along Little Walnut Creek.
The soils of Section 9404 are the same Urban Austin and
Brackett series materials described above, with the addition
of a narrow strip of recent alluvium along Little Walnut Creek.
Section 1005 includes soils of several series. The Houston
Black and Urban soils are like those described for Sections
9412-9419. In addition there are: Frio sandy clay loam, a
bottomland soil found along major streams; Lewisville and
Urban silty clays, typically on major stream terraces; and

Altoga and Urban silty clay and silty clay loam, which developed
in friable calcareous alluvium. Again, the Urban designation
of most of these soils indicates considerable to extreme modi­
fication as a result of development and construction.
Upstream, Walnut Creek is a second order stream which flows
steadily from the Waters Park area, probably because of a sewer
line which parallels the creekbed from the Northwood subdivision.
Little walnut Cres~, a first order stream in its upstream
sections, becomes a second order stream before it joins Walnut
Creek (Gregory and Walling 1973). After this confluence,
Walnut Creek is a third order stream.
In Section 1005, the principal downstream area surveyed,
the major terrain feature is artificial. A diversion channel,
about 6 to 7 meters deep and 20 meters wide at the top tapering
to 3 to 4 meters at the bottom, diverges from Walnut Creek at
a point upstream from the nearby neighborhood and extends about
1,000 meters, rejoining Walnut Creek just north of the Loyola
Lane bridge (see attached map).
RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
The files of the Texas Historical Commission show no sites
listed on the National Register of Historic Places are within
the boundaries of the subject areas. Three previously record­
ed archeological sites are registered with the Texas Archeo­
logical Research Laboratory.
41TV95 was a small lithic scatter on a limestone gravel
terrace just south of the U.S. Highway 290 overpass of Little
Walnut Creek (Section 9404). This site was reported and
collected before construction of a house on the site.
41TV286 is an historic area named Waters Park which lies
partly within the southern end of Section 1017. It is pur­
ported to have been a late nineteenth century village but it
is now almost completely obliterated by modern development of
the area. The only possible remnants of this settlement
3

encountered during this reconnaissance are of dubious historic
significance: a concrete low water crossing, a shallow well
wit h can c ret e d s to newo r k and a s tee 1 pip e hoi s t f r a me, and a
collapsed house of about 1920 vintage.
Initially recorded in 1976, prior to the construction of
the Northwood subdevelopment, 41TV323 is a very extensive and
relatively dense scatter of lithic pieces of all sizes, ranging
from large chunks and cores to bifaces, utilized flakes and
small finishing flakes. In addition, the site report notes
burned rock middens and mano/metate complexes, choppers,
scrapers, gravers and fire-glazed chert. As a result of this
survey, the boundaries of this site have been extended to the
creek on the east and for about 400 meters to the south. In
this newly recorded section, the dense lithic scatter is on
the surface of a horse pasture adjacent to the creekbed (see
attached site report). The originally reported section of
TV323 is in the process of being further encroached upon and
destroyed by the expansion of Northwood. The newly reported
section lies partly on Northwood land and partly on a small
ranch adjacent to this development.
One other small site was recorded by this survey. 41TV518
is a scatter of lithic material approximately 50 meters in
diameter in a densely vegetated area on a terrace along a
tributary of Walnut Creek about 500 meters south of TV323 in
Section 1017 (see attached site report).
RECOII.1MENDATIONS
Previously reported sites 41TV95 and 41TV286 have been
destroyed by modern construction and urban expansion. Site
41TV518, recorded in this survey, is a limited lithic scatter
with no apparent depth. No further work is recommended at
these three sites.
As a result of this reconnaissance, the boundaries of
previously recorded site 41TV323 have been extended into the
_4

area under consideration. The site area is large and the types
of cultural material present are varied. From surficial
evidence similarities to other substantial sites such as the
nearby Rogers Spring Site (Prewitt n.d.) indicate a
potential for long-term occupation of this location, most
probably Archaic to Late Prehistoric. Limited testing in
the least disturbed areas of this site, the section now
used as pasture, is recommended to determine if buried
cultural deposits remain intact or if a surface collection
is warranted.
