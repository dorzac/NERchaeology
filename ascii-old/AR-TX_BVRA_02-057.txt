ABSTRACT
A Phase I cultural resources survey for a proposed recreational facility site (80
acres) in the corporate limits of Brenham, Texas (central Washington County) was
performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates in April 1998. Two archaeological sites
(41WT66 and 41WT67) were found in the project area. Site 41WT66 is a
multi-component site containing prehistoric and historic artifacts. The prehistoric
component was identified by two flakes in shovel tests (in addition, six flakes and a biface
were found on the surface to the west of the main site area); all artifacts were found to be
in a disturbed context. The historic component is a 20th century habitation site or
farmstead that has been disturbed by park construction and cultivation. Site 41WT67 is a
scatter of artifacts dating to the 20th century that may be a farmstead or trash dump. It
has been virtually destroyed by construction prior to this survey. Neither site is significant,
and no further work is recommended. Copies of the report are on file at the Division of
Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical Commission and the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Brenham, Texas plans to construct a recreational facility on an 80 acre
site in the corporate limits of the City of Brenham in central Washington County, Texas
(Figure 1). The project area is bounded on the north by Lounge Road, on the east by
North Park Street (State Highway 36), and on the south and west by private property.
Among the planned improvements are baseball fields, soccer fields, parking lot, pond,
restrooms, pavilion, concessions stands, exercise trail, and nature trail. The exact
location of each of these improvements is depicted on an engineering map prepared by
O'Malley Engineers dated January 1998 (on file at the City of Brenham). The project area
is depicted on the 7.5' U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle Brenham, Texas dated 1963 and
photorevised 1989 (Figure 2).
The project area consists of an 80 acre tract containing shallow sandy soils
overlying a hard clay. Four prominent landforms are present, and it is these areas that
were believed to be high probability areas for site occurrence. The project area is
bisected by Little Sandy Creek that runs east-west through the 80 acre tract and one of its
tributaries which flows northeast-southwest through the project area. Although the entire
80 acres is scheduled for development, the extreme southeast corner was not included in
the grant request to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (Kyle Dannhaus, personal
communication, April 1, 1998). However, since it is planned for future construction, this
section was considered part of the project area and examined during the current survey.
Washington County is one of the earliest areas in Texas to be settled by members
of Austin's "Old Three Hundred" who arrived in the 1820s. Washington County is one of
the original counties of Texas, was created in 1836 and organized in 1837, and named
after George Washington. The town of Brenham became the county seat in 1844. The
topography of the county consists of rolling prairies of sandy loam drained by the Brazos
River and its tributaries. No soils book was available for Washington County at the time of
this study.
Because the project area is located adjacent to an apparent dependable source of
water (Little Sandy Creek) in an area containing significant archaeological sites, the site
of the proposed recreational facility was considered likely to contain evidence of
prehistoric and/or historic sites. Therefore, a Phase I cultural resource survey was
required by the Division of Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical Commission. In order
to satisfy this requirement, the City of Brenham retained Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) to perform the archaeological survey which was carried out on April
1-2, 1998 under antiquities permit 1969 with William E. Moore acting as Principal
Investigator.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Washington County is located in the Central and Southern Planning Region as
defined by the Texas Historical Commission (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996). This region is
divided into smaller units, and Washington County (based on this division) belongs to the
Central Coastal Plains Archeological Region (Mercado-Allinger et al 1996:Figure 1.1.4).
It is only one county removed from the Central Texas Archeological Region to the north
and borders the Southern Coastal Corridor Archeological Region to the south. No sites in
Washington County listed as significant or critical appear in the Planning Document
prepared by the Texas Historical Commission. However, due to its proximity to other
regions it is likely that Washington County shares cultural traits with its neighboring
counties. According to a statistical overview prepared by the Office of the State
Archeologist (Biesaart et al. 1985), there were only 16 sites recorded in the county in
1985. At that time, the number of sites in the county represented only .08% of the total for
Texas. In 1985, 8 sites in Washington County were listed as Archaic and 8 were listed as
Late Prehistoric, and all 16 sites experienced some form of disturbance. A background
check at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas by the
Principal Investigator revealed that Washington County has a relatively low number of
documented archaeological sites (n=65) as compared to other counties in the state. Most
of these sites have been recorded as the result of salvage work at Lake Somervell or
during oil and gas related projects. Other sites have been recorded by individuals such as
Nathan L. Winfield, Jr. who recorded 41WT7 - 41WT11 and 41WT13. The majority of the
remainder of sites in Washington County have been recorded or evaluated by Espey,
Huston & Associates, Inc. (41WT42 - 41WT47; 41WT60; 41WT65), Prewitt and
Associates, Inc. (41WT25 - 41WT29; 41WT33 - 41WT40; 41WT48 - 41WT55; 41WT63 41WT64), the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (41WT62), Texas Archeological
Salvage Project (41WT1 - 41WT4) Texas A&M University (41WT17 - 41WT18), and the
United States Corps of Engineers, Galveston District (41WT30 - 41WT31). The earliest
record of professional archaeological activity in Washington County was at Boggy Creek
where Dee Ann Suhm and Rudolph C. Troike of the University of Texas visited the area
and assisted Nathan L. Winfield, Jr. in a survey of this area in 1955 (Hasskarl 1961).
Three areas containing cultural materials were examined; the Central Midden site, the
South Knoll site, and the Creek site. Later, they were recorded together as 41WT12. In
the Central Midden site arrow point types Perdiz and Scallorn were found in the top level
mixed with dart point types Gary, Morrill, and Palmillas. Although Gary points were found
in all levels, only the lower levels contained Kent, Pedernales, Edgewood, Ellis, Ensor,
and Yarbrough. The Central Midden site and the South Knoll site contained an
abundance of fresh water mussel shells and are described by Hasskarl (1961:298) as
shell middens. The Creek site contained hearthstone fragments in addition to mussel
shell. Unidentifiable ceramics were found at the Central Midden and Creek sites. Faunal
remains from the three areas include mussel shell, deer, and antelope. Based on the
records check at TARL, this is the only site in Washington County that has been tested.
Since valuable subsistence and chronological data were obtained from this project,
researchers are advised to consult this article for additional information.

METHODS
The field survey was conducted utilizing the pedestrian survey method supported
by shovel testing and probing. All earth excavated from the shovel tests were screened
using quarter-inch hardware cloth, and all artifacts found in the tests were collected and
bagged. The artifacts from 41WT66 were recent in age, found in a disturbed context, and
not significant. Therefore, they were not retained for curation. The core from Area E was
an isolated find and was also not retained for curation. Shovel probes were also dug in an
attempt to determine soil depth in certain areas. Probes differ from tests in that they are
not screened and do not appear on the shovel test log. In addition to shovel testing, the
entire area was walked, and a thorough surface inspection was made of all exposed
areas. Site 41WT67 was found by observing historic artifacts on the surface, and the
windmill base at 41WT66 was found by walking transects over this area.
There are four prominent landforms in the project area that were considered to be
high probability areas for archaeological sites. These were assigned the letter
designations A-D. Those areas where sites were found were changed to reflect the site
number. Area A became 41WT66 (TS-1), Area B became 41WT67 (TS-2), and areas C
and D did not change because no site was found. Later, an area below 41WT67 was
examined and designated Area E.
Archaeological sites found during this survey were assigned temporary field
numbers (TS-1 and TS-2) that were later changed to official TARL numbers 41WT66 and
41WT67. The project was documented by color photography, project notes, and a shovel
test log (Appendix I). A map of site 41WT66 was made using a 100 foot tape and
compass (Figure 3), and the approximate location of the shovel tests and features was
plotted on the project area map. William E. Moore supervised the field survey with
assistance from City of Brenham employee, Elwood Draehn.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

Two archaeological sites (41WT66 and 41WT67), an isolated find, and a lithic
scatter in a very disturbed context were found in the project area. Site 41WT66 (Area A)
is a multi-component site containing prehistoric and historic artifacts. The prehistoric
component was identified by two flakes in shovel tests. The historic component is a 20th
century habitation site that has been disturbed by construction and cultivation. Site
41WT67 (Area B) is a 20th century historic habitation site that has been virtually
destroyed by construction prior to this survey.
Area C is a prominent landform in the southeast corner of the project area. At the
time of this survey there was a house on the highest point just across the fence and out of
the project area. Seven shovel tests were excavated in Area C, and no cultural materials
were found. According to Mr. Draehn, the house has been there for at least 60 years, and
the surrounding area was used for cultivation.
Area D is a high point at the extreme southern end of the project area overlooking
Little Sandy Creek to the north. This is a clay hill with no topsoil present. Five shovel
probes confirmed the presence of clay over the entire landform. No prehistoric site is
believed to be present, and no evidence of a historic site was seen on the surface. Only a
small portion of the hilltop is located in the project area boundaries.
Area E is the lower slope or terrace below 41WT67. This is a wooded area
containing oak trees that was not disturbed by the City of Brenham (Kyle Dannhaus,
personal communication to William E. Moore, April 1, 1998). This area is an extension of
the landform containing the remains of 41WT67. However, due to the disturbance
between the two localities it can't be stated with any degree of certainty that 41WT67
extends this far south.
The project area was believed to be a likely area for prehistoric and/or historic
sites. This assumption was based, in part, on the presence of two previously recorded
sites (41WT17 -41WT18) that were identified by Harry J. Shafer in 1980. These sites are
on Little Sandy Creek, 1600 meters and 1800 meters east of the current project area.
According to the site cards on file at TARL, these sites were recorded during a project
sponsored by Texas A&M University (TAMU). However, no record of this survey was
found in a bibliography of TAMU projects (Moore 1988). The recording of sites 41WT66
and 41WT67 provide additional evidence that Little Sandy Creek was a stream that was
utilized in prehistoric and historic times.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
41WT66
This is an early 20th century historic habitation site with a minor prehistoric
component located on a sandy ridge between the 270 and 290 foot contours overlooking
Little Sandy Creek 250 meters to the south. The prehistoric component consists of two
flakes in shovel tests in the main site area. Several flakes and one complete biface were
observed 400 feet west of Shovel Test 3. Because of the distance between these
specimens and the flakes found in shovel tests 12 and 17, this area may represent a small
artifact scatter not associated with 41WT66. Due, however, to the disturbed nature of the
area where these artifacts were observed, no concrete statements regarding their original
provenience can be made; they are simply mentioned. The flake found in shovel test 12
was found above a piece of modern wire. This suggests that this part of the site has been
disturbed, probably through cultivation.
Historic artifacts found in shovel tests include window glass, bottle glass, nails
(machined and cut), wire, one bottleneck, and one shotgun cap. Artifacts observed on
the surface, but not collected, include a flywheel (tractor?), ceramic fragments, bottle
glass, window glass, nails, spoon, and unidentifiable metal objects. One feature, a
windmill base, was identified at 38 feet east of Shovel Test 14.
The exact size of this site is not known; however, based on shovel tests and
artifacts exposed in the dirt road, it appears that the main part of the site is on the top of
the landform with artifacts decreasing to the south, east, and west as one proceeds down
slope. It is estimated that the size of site 41WT67 is 80 feet north south x 180 feet east
west. A few historic artifacts were observed on the surface west of the dirt road in a
disturbed area, but it is not known if they are associated with this site. They could have
been transported to this area in a load of sand that was moved from the location of
41WT67. These artifacts include several ceramic sherds, a .44 caliber bullet, and a hand
painted plate or bowl fragment. The area was shovel tested and found to contain very
shallow soils varying between 05 to 34 cm above hard clay. In addition, this area appears
to have been disturbed by heavy machinery; an uneven ground surface containing large
ruts was observed west of the dirt road.
Twenty-three shovel tests were excavated at site 41WT66. Twelve tests were
positive, and eleven were sterile. In all, 29 artifacts were recovered from shovel testing.
The vast majority were pieces of glass (n=18), mainly window glass.
A map of site 41WT66 appears as Figure 3 of this report. This figure depicts the
approximate location of shovel tests in the main site area, the windmill base, and major
reference points such as roads and large trees.

41WT67
This is a 20th century historic habitation site located on a sandy ridge between the
290 and 300 foot contours overlooking Little Sandy Creek 180 meters to the northeast.
This site appears to have been situated on the highest point (300 foot contour) of this
landform overlooking Little Sandy Creek to the northeast. Virtually the entire area has
been disturbed by the City of Brenham when they removed sand to be used in other areas
of the recreational facility. Because of the disturbance to this site, no shovel tests were
excavated. Instead, a thorough surface examination of the exposed areas was
performed. Artifacts observed include historic crockery fragments, china bowl and plate
fragments, one medicine bottle fragment, and pieces of bottle and window glass. It
should be noted that the contours as depicted on the topographic map are not accurate
since the landform has been altered since this map was photorevised in 1989. The size of
this site is not known. Artifacts found in areas where sand has been transported from this
hill are believed to have come from 41WT67. No collection was made.
Isolated Find
One core was found in Shovel Test 36 in Area E just below site 41WT67. Since no
flakes were found on the disturbed surface of 41WT67 or in the shovel tests and probes or
on the surface on this landform, this specimen is described in this report as an isolated
find.
Lithic Scatter
Five flakes and one biface were observed on a deflated surface due west of
41WT66. Three shovel probes were excavated in this area and clay was found to be
present at the surface. This area has been severely disturbed through land modification
activities. It is possible that this scatter is an extension of the prehistoric component at
41WT66. Unfortunately, however, this can't be substantiated as no additional prehistoric
cultural materials were found between the two areas, either in shovel tests or on the
surface. Not much can be said about this area except a few pieces of lithic debitage and
one biface were observed on a very disturbed surface. No site number was assigned to
this area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Sites 41WT66 and 41WT67 are not significant and do not contain research
potential. It is the recommended that the City of Brenham be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned. Likewise, the isolated find and lithic scatter are not worthy of
additional work. Should, however, cultural materials be identified in areas not discussed
in this report, all work should cease until the situation can be evaluated by the Division of
Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical Commission.
