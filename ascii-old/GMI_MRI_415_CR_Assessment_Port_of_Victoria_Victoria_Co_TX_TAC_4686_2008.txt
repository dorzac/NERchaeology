ABSTRACT

This report presents the results of an archeological survey related to construction of a proposed
barge mooring facility and sediment dumping area along the Victoria Barge Canal in Victoria
County, Texas. The Port of Victoria plans to excavate a barge slip along the Victoria Barge
Canal and place the removed sediments on fields located east of the canal. The area of potential
effects (APE) encompasses a total of 193 acres. The purpose of the cultural resources
investigation in this construction project area was to determine the presence/absence of
archeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for eligibility for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places, as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966, as amended, or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities
Code of Texas.
Geo-Marine, Inc., archeologists conducted fieldwork between January 14 and 21, and again from
February 6–8, 2008. The entire 193 acres of the APE for this project was examined through. the
excavation of 12 trenches and 222 shovel tests. In addition, Geo-Marine archeologists inspected
the ground surface along 73 transects. These efforts resulted in the discovery of two historic
localities. These localities lie on the fringe of the APE, and by definition, localities fail to meet
the criteria for designation as a site. Therefore, it is recommended that the proposed mooring
facility along the Victoria Barge Canal would have no effect on historic archeological properties
in the APE. All notes, forms, and photographs obtained from the project are on file at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory curation repository, the University of Texas at Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

The Victoria Port Authority is proposing to construct a barge mooring facility along the Victoria
Barge Canal (Figures 1 and 2), which is situated in the central portion of southern Victoria
County. The project area is located approximately 3.5 miles west of the town of Bloomington
and 11 miles south of the city of Victoria. The mooring facility will be 4,000 feet (ft) long and
225 ft wide, with a 500-ft taper on each end. Mooring posts will be placed 20 ft center–center at
the edge of the slip. Mechanical excavation will used to remove 55,000 cubic yards of material
above elevation +2 above mean sea level (amsl). The excavated material will be spread over the
adjacent property, Polito Castillo League Abstract 17. At the time of the archeological survey,
the Victoria Port Authority was leasing this land for agricultural use. No construction is proposed
for this portion of the property, but heavy machinery will be used to transfer excavated materials
to this area. The area of potential effects (APE) includes the proposed barge mooring facility and
sediment dumping area, which together cover approximately 193 acres.
The cultural resources fieldwork for this project was undertaken from January 14–21 and
February 6–8, 2008, in order to satisfy federal requirements governing cultural resources
treatment under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915] and the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347; P.L. 91–190; 83 Stat. 852].
Since the Port of Victoria is a political subentity of the State of Texas, its projects must also
comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources Code of
Texas]; therefore, the cultural resources investigation was carried out under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4686.
The purpose of the archeological survey was to identify and inventory all cultural resources
contained within the proposed project area and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL). The Port of Victoria contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), of Plano, Texas,
to provide the required cultural resources investigations (GMI project number 30482.00.03).
Cultural resources investigations, including trenching, shovel-testing, and pedestrian survey, were
conducted over the entire 193 acres within the project area. Fieldwork was conducted under the
direction of Project Archeologist Mr. Jonathan Meyer. Ms. Bethany Oliver, Ms. Lana Martin,
Mr. Ryan Bennett, and Ms. Noel Steinke served as field crew for this project. Ms. Melissa Green
of GMI served as Principal Investigator for the project.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

This chapter summarizes the modern natural environmental conditions of the survey area by
providing information about the topography and hydrology, geology, soils, climate, and flora and
fauna.

TOPOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
Victoria County lies on the southwestern edge of the Texan biotic province, defined by Blair
(1950) as an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces, and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some
species reach the limits of their ranges in the Texan province. The project area lies alongside the
Victoria Barge Canal, which was carved within the Guadalupe River valley. The project area
falls inside the Upland Prairies and Woods subregion of the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes
region of south coastal Texas (LBJ School of Public Affairs 1978).
Topographically, Victoria County exhibits mostly grassy, slightly rolling plains (Marvin et al.
1962). The Guadalupe River and smaller drainages, such as the San Antonio River and Coletto
Creek, have altered Victoria County’s topography in some areas by cutting valleys into the plain.
Through the Holocene, the meandering has carved at least three different paths through Victoria
County plains (Weinstein 1992). Holocene sea-level rise between 9,500 years before present
(B.P.) and 4,500 B.P. may have also played a role in shaping the landscape around the project area.
Weinstein (1992) suggests that during this time, the San Antonio Bay extended up the Guadalupe
River valley north of Green Lake. National Elevation Datatset (NED) shaded relief maps (1 arc
second) illustrate wide valleys likely forged by higher sea levels (Figure 3). The project area
appears to be on what would have been either the floor of the San Antonio Bay or the delta of the
Guadalupe River during the apex of the Holocene sea-level rise (Figure 4). Following this
theory, the terraces found just outside of the project area represent an early Holocene shoreline.
The plains of Victoria County reflect the outcrop areas of the Pleistocene Lissie Formation, below
Pleistocene-era Beaumont clays and covered by Holocene alluvial deposits (Chowdhury and
Turco 2006; Marvin et al. 1962). These sediments hold water in the Chicot aquifer, which is part
of the larger Gulf Coast aquifer (Baker 1979; Chowdhury and Turco 2006). Freshwater found in
5

this aquifer comes from precipitation that falls within Victoria and it neighboring counties.
Although a moderate supply of water is found in the recent alluvium and Beaumont clay layers of
Victoria County, much larger deposits of freshwater sufficient for municipal and industrial needs
lie within the Lissie Formation sediments (Marvin et al. 1962).

GEOLOGY
The project area is underlain by Holocene alluvial deposits above the Pleistocene Beaumont
Formation. Below the Beaumont level lies the Pleistocene Lissie Formation that contains thick
sand layers with clay, silt, and caliche inclusions. Beneath these Quaternary stratigraphic units
are the Tertiary period deposits, starting with the Pliocene epoch Goliad sands and sandstone.
The next three formations are from the Miocene epoch and consist of the Lagarto clay and sandy
clay that lies above the Oakville sandstone layer and the Catahoula volcanic tuff and tuffaceous
clay. The Holocene alluvium has an approximate maximum thickness of 300 ft. The Beaumont
and Lissie formations each reach thicknesses of nearly 600 ft. The Goliad sand is up to 400 ft
thick, and the Lagarto clay is around 1,000 ft thick. The maximum thickness for the Oakville unit
nears 500 ft, and the Catahoula layer is approximately 1,000 ft (Marvin et al. 1962).

SOILS
The only soil series mapped within the project area is the occasionally flooded Meguin silty clay
(Miller 1982). These soils are generally found on 0 to 1 percent slopes and consist of fine silty,
mixed, hyperthermic Fluventic Haplustolls (Miller 1982). Upslope from the north end of the area
proposed for the barge slip lie Kuy series sandy soils. These soils are found on 0 to 5 percent
slopes and contain loamy, siliceous, hyperthermic Grossarenic Paleudalfs (Miller 1982).
Although Kuy soils are not mapped within the project area, a good possibility exists for this series
mixing with Meguin soils in the northernmost portion of the project area.

CLIMATE
Victoria County has a subtropical climate, with dry winters and hot and humid summers.
Temperatures can change rapidly, but average around 13° Celsius (C; 55° Fahrenheit [F]) during
the winter months and 28°C (83°F) in the summer. Temperatures normally stay above freezing,
and the area generally has a freeze-free period of 290 days each year. Precipitation usually
arrives in the form of gentle rain; however, violent tropical storms also occasionally strike the
county during the summer and fall months. Victoria County averages 97 centimeters (cm; 38
inches [in]) of precipitation annually, with May, June, and September being the wettest months
(Miller 1982).

FLORA AND FAUNA
The predominant trees within the Upland Prairies and Woods subregion of Victoria County
include post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), and live oak (Quercus
virginiana), with appearances of sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), elm (Ulmus americana),
pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and hackberry (Celtis pallida), black willow (Salix nigra), and
8

hickory (Carya spp.). Brush species in the area include pricklypear (Opuntia lindheimeri),
whitebrush (Aloysia gratissima), huisache (Acacia farnesiana), catclaw (Acacia greggii),
blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), and anacua (Ehretia anacua). Area
herbaceous plants consist of brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), gamagrass (Tripsacum
dactyloides), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and gulf muhly (Muhlenbergia capillaris) (Blair
1950; Gould 1975; Griffith et al. 2004).
Victoria County is home to a variety of animal species. Mammals include whitetail deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor Canadensis), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus)
(Figure 5), raccoon (Procyon lotor), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), opossum (Didelphis
marsupialis), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.). Birds residing
in the area include herons (Ardea spp.), ducks (Anas spp.), geese (Branta spp.), turkey vultures
(Cathartes aura), bird hawks (Accipiter spp.), and owls (Strigidae spp.). Several species of
snakes, lizards, frogs, and turtles are among the reptiles and amphibians living within Victoria
County. Some of the aquatic species native to Victoria County include gar (Lepisosteus spp.),
gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), eel (Anguilla spp.), clam (Rangia cuneata), eastern oyster
(Crassostrea virginica), and several mussel species (McGuff 1978; White et al. 1989).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
A fair amount of archeological research has been conducted in Victoria County. As of 2008, the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin shows 114 sites recorded in the
county. Four of these sites (41VT98, 41VT101, 41VT103, and 41VT113) lie within a mile of the
project area (Figure 6). Sites 41VT98, 41VT101, and 41VT103 are Archaic to Late Prehistoric
age sites situated on the bluffs overlooking the Victoria Barge Canal. Based on Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas data, these three sites were recorded in the 1980s. The Buckeye Knoll
site, 41VT98 was first identified in the 1960s by amateur archeologist Ed Vogt but not officially
recorded until 1982 during a brief reconnaissance survey by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE), Galveston District (Weinstein 1992). The site is on both sides of the canal
approximately 130 m north of the northernmost edge of the current project area. Coastal
Environments, Inc., carried out testing investigations (Weinstein 1991, 1992) and recommended
the site eligible for NRHP inclusion. In the treatment plan designed by Ricklis and Doran (2003)
for mitigation of the site, the authors explain the importance of the site:
The Buckeye Knoll site, 41VT98, is . . . unique in several important ways. First, it is the largest Early
Archaic cemetery (ca. 5,000 B.C.) ever found west of the Mississippi River and . . . one of the three
largest early cemeteries with preserved human remains in North America. Second, the assemblage of
mortuary artifacts found associated with these burials represents a previously undiscovered early
culture. Third, the site has yielded the most complete sequence of stratified or layered cultural deposits
yet found in southern Texas, a sequence estimated to represent more than 10,000 years, almost the
entire span of known regional prehistory [Ricklis and Doran 2003:6].

Both sites 41VT101 and 41VT103 are along the canal roughly 1 mile north of the project area
and were recorded in 1989 during the USACE, Galveston District, Channel to Victoria
archeological investigations by Coastal Environments, Inc. (Weinstein 1992). Site 41VT101 is a
surficial lithic scatter in secondary deposition on the east side of the canal. Based on information
again from local amateur archeologist Ed Vogt who collected an Ensor projectile point, the
original site likely dated to the Late Archaic. At the time of recording, no additional work was
recommended because earlier barge canal construction had destroyed primary in situ material.
Site 41VT103 was recorded on the west side of the canal as a stratified shell midden and eroded
lithic debitage scatter associated with possibly Archaic to Early Prehistoric occupations, and
11

additional investigation was recommended (Weinstein 1992). The site was revisited by Pruitt and
Associates in 1993 (Gadus et al. 1993), but after subsequent testing in 1995 was recommended
not eligible for NRHP inclusion because of lack of integrity (Gadus et al. 1999).
Site 41VT113, recorded in 1993, is the Dalton Bridge, a historic suspension bridge that was used
to transport cattle across the Guadalupe River (Gadus et al. 1993). This site is situated between
sites 41VT103 and 41VT98. This type of bridge, called a “livestock bridge,” was apparently
unique to regional agriculture in this part of Texas, and considered eligible for listing in the
NRHP. Recommendations called for additional data collection concerning construction and
distribution (Gadus et al. 1993).
Several archeological surveys and testing projects have been undertaken in the immediate vicinity
of the project area (e.g., Gadus et al. 1993; Gadus et al. 1999; Ricklis and Doran 2003; Weinstein
1991, 1992, 2002), but no surveys have been conducted within the project area itself (see Figure
6). In 1990 and 1991 the area surrounding site 41VT98 (Buckeye Knoll site) along the Victoria
Barge Canal upstream from the proposed project area was surveyed and tested (Weinstein 1991,
1992). Additional mitigation of 41VT98 was subsequently conducted 2003 (Ricklis and Doran
2003). Pruitt and Associates Inc., conducted survey and testing north of the present project area
(site 41VT113 and 41VT103 area) in conjunction with construction related to the Victoria Barge
Canal for the USACE, Galveston District (Gadus et al. 1993, 1999). The land directly across the
Victoria Barge Canal from the project area and extending south was surveyed in 1993 and in
1998 for the USACE, Galveston District, after the construction project was reconfigured; no sites
were identified (Gadus et al. 1993, 1999).

THE COASTAL TEXAS CULTURE CHRONOLOGY
Southern Texas encompasses the area south of the Edwards Plateau, east of the Rio Grande, and
west of the Gulf of Mexico. This area, including Victoria County and the Port of Victoria barge
mooring facility, falls into the Southwest culture area, although it is not far from the Southern
Great Plains and Southeast culture areas (Woodbury 1979). Perttula (2004:Figure 1.1) further
divides Southern Texas into the South Texas archeological region in the west and the Coastal
Texas archeological region in the east. The South Texas archeological region corresponds to the
South Texas Plains physiographic zone (Perttula 2004:Figure 1.2), and the Coastal Texas region
covers the gulf prairies and marshes extending 40 to 50 miles inland south of the Colorado River
and north of the Mexican border (Hester 1995, 2004; Perttula 1995, 2004; Ricklis 1995, 2004).
The Port of Victoria barge mooring facility project area falls into the Coastal Texas archeological
region (Figure 7).
The chronology of Coastal Texas archeology can be divided into four broad cultural stages:
Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric/Post-Archaic, and Historic/Contact (Gadus et al. 1999;
Ricklis 1995, 2004; Ricklis and Doran 2003; Weinstein 1992). Some of these cultural stages can
be further divided into substages based on changes in artifact assemblages and other
archeological features (Table 1).
The chronology presented in this report is based on the work of several authors (i.e., Gadus et al.
1999; Ricklis 1995, 2004; Ricklis and Doran 2003; Weinstein 1992), but favors dates from the
Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98) as described by Ricklis and Doran (2003), since this site is adjacent
to the project area. A finalized chronology for the Buckeye Knoll site, however, has not been
published; therefore, the chronology here also incorporates other sources.

Paleo-Indian Stage: 11,200 B.P.–9,000 B.P.
The Paleo-Indian stage is marked by the use of first the fluted Clovis and Folsom/Midland
projectile points and later the lanceolate Golondrina, Plainview, and stemmed Victoria points for
hunting large game.
Early Paleo-Indian
Clovis sites, marked by their distinctive fluted projectile points, have been discovered throughout
the Coastal Texas region. In Victoria County and near the project area, evidence of the Clovis
period is limited mostly to isolated finds and a few tested sites (Weinstein 1992). Of these, the
Johnston-Heller site is probably the most studied, although this site has never been subjected to
large scale excavation (Birmingham and Hester 1976; Bourbon 1997). This site lies
approximately 20 miles northwest of the project area and contains both Clovis and Late PaleoIndian points.
Clovis sites are frequently associated with extinct Pleistocene megafauna such as bison and
mammoth (Hofman 1989). However, the precise subsistence strategy for Clovis peoples,
particularly the level of plant and smaller game exploitation, continues as a subject for debate
(e.g., Cannon and Meltzer 2004; Haynes 2002; Hofman and Graham 1998; Peter and Weston
1993; Waguespack and Surovell 2003). Also in dispute is the procurement method for the
megafauna found at Clovis sites. At the core of this question is whether megafauna at Clovis
sites were actually hunted or simply scavenged, as well as whether some sites represent a
combination of these two activities (Holliday et al. 1993).
Clovis sites normally contain lithic tools constructed from high quality raw materials. Often, the
source for the material lies more than 320 kilometers (km; 200 miles [mi]) from the site (Hofman
1989). Since little evidence exists in support of permanent settlements among Clovis peoples, it
is likely that these people moved frequently, probably in response to large game migration.
Consequently, there would be little opportunity to establish political and trade relationships, and
therefore, the hunters themselves likely accomplished lithic procurement as part of their mobility
pattern (Meltzer 1987).

In many regions, Folsom and/or Midland period sites chronometrically follow Clovis sites. Thin
projectile points, normally with pronounced fluting, marginal retouch, prominent basal ears, and a
deeply concave or curved base, represent Folsom sites. Midland sites include points that share
many morphological attributes with Folsom points, but lack the fluting common to Folsom
points. Midland points are found in association with Folsom points at many sites (Bousman et al.
2004). Artifacts such as stone gravers, scrapers, and engraved bone pieces may also be found in
Folsom/Midland assemblages. Folsom/Midland subsistence appears to have focused on bison
(Bison antiquus), which would have required a high degree of mobility, accompanied by low
population densities (Amick 1996). These peoples, however, likely supplemented their diet with
other sources of game (e.g., deer and pronghorn), as well as plant species (Peter and Weston
1993). Folsom/Midland bison kills appear to contain a relatively small number of animals
(normally less than 25), and the skeletons found appear to have been selectively butchered, with
the high-quality portions missing (Hofman 1989). Kelly and Todd (1988) suggest that hunters of
this period followed the bison herd immediately after the kill, taking only what food they could
carry with them. Under this model, maintaining contact with the food supply took precedence
over processing the kill for storage.
In the Coastal Texas archeological region, few Folsom sites have been found. No Folsom sites
are recorded in Victoria County or near the project area, but the Morhiss site (41VT1) produced
the distal end of a Midland style point (Dockall and Black 2006). This site lies approximately 5½
miles northwest of the project area. The closest Folsom site to the project area may be the
Buckner Ranch site (41BE2) in Bee County (Weinstein 1992). At least four other Folsom sites
have been recorded near or within the Coastal Texas archeological region. These include site
41NU189 in Nueces County, site 41HG6 in Hidalgo County, site 41HR624 in Harris County, and
the Loftin Folsom locality (41LK83) in Live Oak County. None of these four sites, however, has
been excavated.

Late Paleo-Indian
Although some question remains regarding the dates for the Late Paleo-Indian period (Holliday et
al. 1999), it is generally regarded to have begun near the end of the Folsom period (ca. 10,500
B.P.) and lasted for approximately 1,500 years (Gadus et al. 1999; Weinstein 1992). Like earlier
periods of the Paleo-Indian stage, the Late Paleo-Indian period continued to rely on large game.
Extinction (or evolution) of Bison antiquus, however, forced focus onto modern bison (Bison
bison). Some Late Paleo-Indian sites also show evidence of use of other animal species. At the
Hinds Cave site in Val Verde County, Texas, the largest proportion (42 percent) of faunal
material came from deer (Lord 1984). A large amount of smaller vertebrate material was
discovered at the site, as well (Lord 1984; Shafer and Bryant 1977). Similar findings were made
at the Horn Shelter No. 2 site near the Brazos River in Bosque County, Texas. Here, skeletal
remains from many small animals (e.g., bird, reptile, and small mammal) were found along with
bison bones (Forrester 1985). Closer to the project area, the Berger Bluff site (41GD30) appears
to display this expanded resource exploitation strategy (Hester et al. 1989; Weinstein 1992).
Here, bones from small animals such as rabbit, gopher, turtle, fish, and bird were found in
association with Paleo-Indian living surfaces (Brown 2006).
Late Paleo-Indian period sites near the project area may hold a variety of point types. Absent are
the fluted point types of the Clovis and Folsom periods, being replaced by unfluted, lanceolate
projectile points. The Buckner Ranch site (41BE2), for example, produced Plainview,
16

Golondrina, Angostura, and Scottsbluff points. Meserve points were found along with Plainview
and Angostura examples at the Morhiss Mound site (41VT1) (Campbell 1976). At the Miller site
(41VT5), Gower and Bell points were recovered with other Late Paleo-Indian types (Hester
1980). An inventory of artifacts found at the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98), just north of the
project area, has not been published, but preliminary reports indicate the presence of Angostura
among other Late Paleo-Indian point types (Ricklis and Doran 2003). Typically, the Late PaleoIndian period is associated with increased regionalization; however, Weinstein (1992) also
suggests that point type variation seen at some Coastal Texas region sites may reflect
chronological differences. For example, Plainview points appear at the J-2 Ranch site (41VT6)
between 10,500 B.P. and 9,200 B.P. and are later replaced by Scottsbluff points dating from 8,800
B.P. to 8,000 B.P. (Fox et al. 1978).

Archaic Stage: 9,000 B.P.–1,200 B.P.
The Archaic stage marks the beginning of a more sedentary lifestyle on the Southern Great
Plains. Local resource use became more intensive and the material culture displayed much
greater diversity, as marked by the appearance of grinding tools, roasting ovens, rock-lined
hearths, and a variety of notched and stemmed projectile points (Collins 2004). As bison became
less available, other resources, including plants and smaller animal species, were exploited more
intensively. Broadly speaking, the archeological sites dated to this period are larger and more
numerous, suggesting a growing human population. Dates regarding the Archaic stage
subdivisions vary by area and author (e.g., Black 1989; Collins 2004; Hester 2004; Ricklis 2004;
Ricklis and Doran 2003; Weinstein 1992), but the changes between substages are generally
marked by differences in subsistence strategy and point typology (Hofman 1989).

Early Archaic
The Coastal Texas region experienced a rise in sea level as the climate began its transition from
the anathermal to the warmer and wetter altithermal (Frazier 1974). This may have led to
increased shellfish exploitation, particularly oysters (Crassostrea virginica), in substitute of large
game (Ricklis 2004). Within the Coastal Texas archeological region, early Archaic points such as
Gower, Wells, Bell, Andice, and Uvalde have been found (Gadus et al. 1993; Weinstein 2002).
Unfortunately, these finds have been in mostly surficial contexts and good dates are not available
for this period in the Coastal Texas archeological region (Fox and Hester 1976; Gadus et al. 1993;
Weinstein 2002). Consequently, the dates provided for this region’s Early Archaic period are
based on similarities in point morphologies with dated materials in Central Texas (Weinstein
1992, 2002). The Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98), however, may help provide more secure dates
for this period because several burials with associated mortuary items were recovered at this site
(Ricklis and Doran 2003).

Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic brought sea level stabilization and increased exploitation of coastal resources
in the region (Ricklis and Blum 1997). As with the Early Archaic, many Middle Archaic sites in
Victoria County and Coastal Texas lack secure dates (Gadus et al. 1993). Consequently, this
period’s dates are inferred based on point type chronologies developed in Central Texas (Hester
17

1980). Generally, the Middle Archaic in Coastal Texas is marked by the proliferation of
triangular dart points (Hester 1980). Middle Archaic point types found in the area include
Bulverde, Nolan, Travis, Palmillas, Pedernales, Kinney, and Tortugas styles (Weinstein 2002).
At the Buckeye Knoll site, early triangular and Refugio dart points were discovered with
evidence of short-term occupation (Ricklis and Doran 2003). Again, dates from this site should
help secure the chronological extent of the Middle Archaic in Coastal Texas.

Late Archaic
In the early part of the Late Archaic, a rapid rise in sea level took place, but by 3,000 B.P., the sea
level returned to a stable point near that of today (Ricklis and Blum 1997). The number of sites
in estuarine habitats increases dramatically during the Late Archaic. Although fishing appears to
be this period’s primary subsistence strategy in Coastal Texas, the presence of points and
mammal faunal material indicates that hunting was not abandoned in the Late Archaic (Ricklis
and Blum 1997). Late Archaic point types common to the area include Marshall, Williams,
Castroville, Ensor, Darl, and Fairland dart points (Weinstein 2002). Again, the Buckeye Knoll
site should provide significant insight into the Late Archaic because it contains burial and
occupation features from this period. Pedernales, Morhiss, Lange, Fairland, and Ensor points
were among the artifacts recovered from this site. In addition, the site produced several hearths
and five burials dating to the Late Archaic (Ricklis and Doran 2003).

Late Prehistoric/Post-Archaic Stage: 1,200–250 B.P
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric/Post-Archaic period in the Coastal Texas archeological
region is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The earliest phase of the Late
Prehistoric/Post-Archaic stage is marked by the Scallorn type arrow point and the absence of
ceramics. This phase, referred to as the Blue Bayou phase, dates between 1,200 and 1,050 B.P.
(Weinstein 1992). After 1,050 B.P., Goose Creek ceramics from the upper Texas coast begin to
appear in the vicinity of Victoria County in what is referred to as the Anaqua phase (Weinstein
1992, 2002), followed by the Rockport phase ca. 850 B.P. and continuing to 250 B.P.. This phase
is marked by the presence of Rockport style ceramics and Perdiz, Fresno, Cliffton, and Young
arrow points (Weinstein 2002).
The Late Prehistoric/Post-Archaic stage is represented by several well-dated sites in Coastal
Texas (Gadus et al. 1993). Therefore, the Buckeye Knoll site is unlikely to play a crucial role in
fine-tuning this region’s Late Prehistoric/Post-Archaic chronology. Nonetheless, this site appears
to contain materials from all of the Late Prehistoric/Post-Archaic phases and should contribute to
the understanding of this period. Currently, the Late Prehistoric/Post-Archaic is understood as a
period with broad-based subsistence strategies. During this period, estuarine resources, especially
clams (Rangia cuneata) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica), and terrestrial game such as deer
(Odocoileus virginianus) and buffalo (Bison bison) were intensely exploited. The increased site
densities found during this period also suggest population growth (Gadus et al. 1993).

18

Historic/Contact Stage: 250 B.P.–Present
The Spaniard Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca provides the first European account of the Coastal
Texas region. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca and three other survivors from the ill-fated Pánfilo de
Narváez expedition were shipwrecked on an island off the Texas coast. Cabeza de Vaca
described the native peoples as living on the island during the fall and winter months, catching
fish and collecting plants roots, then moving to the mainland to hunt and gather oysters during the
rest of the year (Covey 1983). In the late 1600s, explorers and Spanish missionaries were the
next group of Europeans to arrive on the Texas coast. In 1685, René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la
Salle, led a group of French colonists to Matagorda Bay where they established a settlement
called Fort St. Louis. La Salle’s group, however, struggled with the native Karankawa. After an
outbreak of smallpox among La Salle’s contingency, the Karankawa attacked the settlement in
1688, killing or capturing all of the remaining colonists (Cox 1905). Prior to this event, Spanish
authorities sent out expeditions to find the French colony. In the process, they produced several
accounts of the Texas coast (Weddle 1973). In 1689, a group led by the Spaniard Alonzo de
León, traveled through present-day Victoria County before finding the ruins of Fort St. Louis
(Weddle 1991).
Throughout the eighteenth century, the Spanish established missions and presidios along the
Texas coastal region. Relations between the Spanish and the Karankawa, by now, were amiable.
The Karankawa were mostly left to practice their traditional ways, and in 1790, they even agreed
to a peace treaty with the Spanish. After the expulsion of Spanish authority from Mexico,
however, Mexican ranchers drove the Karankawa out of Coastal Texas by 1850 (Ricklis 1996).
In 1824, the town of Victoria was established essentially as a stock-raising hub. By 1850, the
town had a population of 806 people. This population doubled within 10 years, spurred mostly
by immigrants trying their luck at ranching and farming (Walter et al. 1999). By the late 1800s,
the construction of railroads made Victoria County an important shipping destination. Then, in
the early 1900s, the discovery of oil brought additional wealth to the area (Grimes 1968).

METHODOLOGY

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, a search of the available archival data was undertaken by the Project
Archeologist, who reviewed data sources housed at TARL and in the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas to obtain information on previous investigations and known sites within or near the current
project area. An examination of geological sources, available early historic maps, and aerial
photographs was instrumental in forming a background for the history of the area. This
information was used to determine the locations of all known archeological sites, standing
structures, National Register properties, and National Historic Landmarks (NHL) that might be
situated near or within the project area. The results of the research were used to guide the field
methods, to determine the areas in which previously recorded sites would be encountered, and to
locate landforms with the highest probability to retain archeological deposits. These data also
served as a contextual framework so that any newly recorded sites could be evaluated for
significance.

DETERMINATION OF PROBABILITY AREAS
The determination of the probability for the proposed APE to contain archeological properties
was necessary to determine the survey methodology. Geological and soils information were
critical data sources for this determination. The proposed project area is adjacent to the Victoria
Barge Canal in Victoria County, Texas. Geologically, the project area is within the Gulf Coastal
Plain near the mouth of the Guadalupe River. The Holocene alluvium within the Guadalupe
River valley is bordered by the Beaumont and Lissie formations, both dating to the Pleistocene
period. The Beaumont consists mainly of partially calcareous clays and muds deposited in relict
interdistributary floodbasins of a fluvial/deltaic system (Barnes 1975). The proposed project area
is situated within the Holocene alluvium of the Guadalupe River. The soil series Meguin consists
of deep, moderately permeable, well-drained clayey soils located on floodplains.
The distribution of the Holocene deposits of this area has been mapped in general by the Bureau
of Economic Geology (Barnes 1975), and specific geomorphic features of this region were
delineated in greater detail by McGowen et al. (1976) who identified four Modern-Holocene age
geomorphic units in the immediate vicinity of the project area:
21

1. meanderbelt sand and silt, sparsely grass- and shrub-covered, inactive, within an
entrenched valley
2. floodbasin, overbank mud, grass-covered, inactive within an entrenched valley
3. meanderbelt sand without prominent grain, tree-covered, locally overbank muds, inactive,
within an entrenched valley (Holocene), and
4. an abandoned channel course, swamp-covered and mud-filled
The specific age of these deposits were, at least at the time of mapping, unknown, and the Bureau
of Economic Geology has never, to date, subdivided Holocene-age landform–sediment
assemblages during its mapping projects. Since this map was published, there have been several
archeological projects in the area that have provided details on the age of the deposits in different
areas along the Canal to Victoria.
The most detailed regional-scale work is Weinstein’s (1992) summary, based upon archeological
and paleoenvironmental work associated with the Canal to Victoria. Weinstein and Junkin
(1992:19–20) note that there are at least four different-aged meanderbelt–paleochannel trends
present within the Holocene alluvial deposits of the Guadalupe valley: (1) Dry Creek/Sand
Bayou, (2) Blue Bayou-Spring Bayou, (3) Hog Bayou (Old River, Black Bayou), and (4) the
modern Guadalupe River meanderbelt. Later in the same volume, Weinstein (1992) provides a
detailed paleogeographical interpretation of this region and assigns the visible Holocene-age
geomorphic features into one of five temporal periods: (1) Early and Late Paleo-Indian Period
(9200–6000 B.C.), (2) Early Archaic (6000–2600 B.C.), 3) Middle Archaic (2600–1000 B.C.), (4)
Late Archaic (1000 B.C.–A.D. 700), and (5) Late Prehistoric and Early Historic (A.D. 700–1840).
In regard to the project area, Weinstein (1992:371) has mapped the paleochannel that forms a
prominent arcuate cut up against the Pleistocene uplands immediately north and east of the canal
and the project area to be of Early Archaic age. The paleochannel that cross-cuts the area
immediately to the south of the project area identified by McGowen et al. (1976) is inferred by
Weinstein (1992:377) to be a Late Archaic-age channel of the Guadalupe. If Weinstein is correct,
the majority of the deposits in the project area are likely to be of Early Archaic age.
Deposits of this age have been found in the immediate vicinity of the project area. At site
41VT103, just upstream of site 41VT98, Gadus et al. (1999) exposed channel, levee, and
floodplain deposits of Early Archaic age and obtained a date of 6630 ± 70 BP (Beta-84358) on
Rangia sp. shells from Test Pit 1, about 1 m below original ground surface. Closer to the project
area, Albert (n.d.) retrieved a 4-m core from the Guadalupe River floodplain deposits
immediately west of site 41VT98 and obtained a series of radiocarbon dates that ranged from
1,820 years BP at 80 cm (Beta-164217; bulk sediment) to 6820 BP at 4.3 m (Beta-164222; bulk
sediment), with deposits below 2.5 m falling into Weinstein’s Early Archaic period. Hence, it
appears that immediately north of the project area previous projects have encountered an Early
Archaic-age alluvial depositional unit at the surface or draped with a thin veneer of later
Holocene alluvium.
Based on the results discussed in Weinstein’s 1992 survey report and his projections of where
paleochannels occur, the easternmost section—approximately 54 acres primarily east of the
contour line on the topographic map (Figure 8)—is considered to have a high probability of
containing archeological deposits in the near-surface sediments. These 54 acres are considered to
contain a higher potential due to their proximity to the paleochannel in this area. The remaining
120 acres are considered to be of low probability; consequently, it was recommended that
pedestrian survey with associated judgmental shovel testing be conducted. Discussions with the
22

USACE, Galveston District, and the Texas Historical Commission resulted in the determination
that five backhoe trenches would be excavated in the proposed excavation area for the barge
mooring facility.

ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODOLOGY
The approximately 193-acre project area was split into three survey areas (see Figure 8), based on
the potential to contain cultural resources. Survey Area 1 focused on the proposed excavation
area for the barge mooring facility. East of the proposed mooring facility were Survey Areas 2
and 3, where the excavated barge slip sediments would be placed. Survey Area 2 was a low
probability area for cultural resources, and Survey Area 3 comprised a high probability area.
Pedestrian transects and shovel testing varied within each survey area, depending on physical
ground conditions. The heavily wooded portion of Survey Area 1 (the northwesternmost part of
the project area) was inspected along 25-m (82 ft) transects, with shovel tests at 150-m (492 ft)
intervals on each transect because of its proximity to site 41VT98. Transects in Survey Area 2
were set at 15 m (49 ft), with judgmental shovel tests. All shovel tests in these two areas were
hand-excavated to 45–70 cm (18–28 in) below surface (bs). In Survey Area 3, transects and
shovel tests were spaced at 30-m (98 ft) intervals. Shovel tests along the northernmost half of the
transects were hand-excavated to approximately 50–60 cm (20–24 in) bs, but because of
extremely wet and clayey conditions, shovel tests in the southern half were excavated with a
backhoe to approximately 1 m (39 in) bs. All hand-excavated shovel tests measured
approximately 35 cm (14 in) in width, and backhoe-excavated shovel tests were approximately
60 cm (24 in) in width. Fill from all shovel test units was screened through 0.635 cm (0.25 in)
hardware cloth. A shovel test survey form was used to record soil matrix descriptions and artifact
findings for each excavated unit.
Backhoe trenches were excavated in Survey Areas 1 and 3 to 3 m (10 ft) in length and to a depth
of 3 m or to the water table. Once dug, the trenches were profiled and photographed. A sample
of sediments from each visible sedimentary level in the trenches was screened through 0.635-cm
(0.25-in) hardware cloth. All trenches and shovel test units were backfilled after the final
recording process was completed.
The Project Archeologist maintained daily field notes that detailed the investigations and field
observations. Each crewmember was responsible for recording the results of each shovel test
excavated by that individual. Shovel test and trench locations were recorded using a Trimble
global positioning system (GPS) unit. These points were corrected using base station files from
the Victoria base station, operated by TxDOT, and converted into shapefiles using Pathfinder 3.1
software. Digital maps plotting the survey areas and shovel tests were created using ESRI
ArcMap 9.1. Digital photographs were taken to record the general topography of these areas and
activities related to the cultural resources investigations. The Project Archeologist maintained a
log of all photographs taken during the project.
A site was defined when materials were recovered from two or more shovel tests or, for surficial
materials, when five or more prehistoric artifacts were found in a 20-m (65.6-ft) square. Any
cultural materials not meeting these criteria were referred to as localities. All materials, notes,
and photographs obtained from this project are on file at TARL, University of Texas at Austin.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

The 193 acres of the project area were subdivided into three areas, based on probability, and were
examined through excavation of 12 trenches and 222 shovel tests (Figure 9). In addition, the
ground surface was inspected along 72 transects. Survey Area 1 was the linear area adjacent to
the canal for the proposed barge mooring facility. Survey Area 2 was east of and adjacent to
Survey Area 1 and considered to be a low probability area for cultural resources. Survey Area 3
was the northeastern edge and the northern corner of the project area and was considered to hold
the highest potential for cultural resources.
SURVEY AREA 1
Survey Area 1 encompassed the approximately 19 acres adjacent to the barge canal that will be
excavated to form the proposed mooring slip. This area was 1,219 m (4,000 ft) long and 69 m
(225 ft) wide, with a 152-m (500-ft) taper on each end (see Figure 9). The northwestern end of
the area was heavily wooded, but nearly 10 acres at the southwestern end were open pasture and
plowed field that abutted Survey Area 2. Because of the proximity to the Buckeye Knoll site
(roughly 125 m to the northwest) as well as the presence of Holocene-aged sediments and their
potential to contain cultural materials, Survey Area 1 was thoroughly examined through backhoe
trenches, pedestrian transects, and shovel tests.
Five backhoe trenches were excavated in this survey area (see Figure 9). Each trench was at least
3 m long and excavated to 3 m in depth or to the water table, depending on which was reached
first. Because of proximity to the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT 98) just north of the survey area, the
northern edge of Survey Area 1 was deemed the most likely to hold buried prehistoric materials.
Therefore, Trenches 1 and 2 were excavated at its northernmost end. Trench 3 was placed near
the middle of the survey area, and Trenches 4 and 5 were in the southeastern open area. Trenches
3, 4, and 5 were excavated to obtain an exploratory sample of the entire barge slip area.
The northwestern end of Survey Area 1 was heavily wooded, except for a vehicle trail parallel to
the canal. In order to examine the portions of this area not covered by trenching, four 25-m
transects were walked the length of the wooded area. Four shovel tests, staggered at 150-m
intervals along each transect, were excavated into the hard clay layer to between 45 and 60 cm bs.
No artifacts or cultural features were discovered in Survey Area 1.
25

Trenching

Trench 1
Trench 1 was placed in the heavily wooded, extreme northwestern end of Survey Area 1,
approximately 280 m south of Dupont Road and 70 m east of the Victoria Barge Canal. The
upper layer of the trench appeared to evidence some influence from the sandy Kuy series
sediments found in the bluffs to the north of the project area. Below this top layer, though, the
sediments more closely matched those found elsewhere in the project area (Table 2, Figure 10).

Trench 2
Trench 2, also near the northern edge of Survey Area 1, was 50 m southeast of Trench 1.
Sediments in Trench 2 appeared relatively homogeneous, especially in the bottom 2 m (Table 3,
Figure 11).

Trench 3
Trench 3 was 440 m southeast of Trench 2. The sediments in Trench 3 proved even more
uniform than those in Trench 2. Sediments appeared relatively homogeneous, especially in the
bottom 2 m (Table 4, Figure 12).

Trench 4
Trench 4 was placed 280 m southeast of Trench 3 and 15 m east of the Victoria Barge Canal.
This trench was in the southwest corner of land currently used for a hayfield. At the time of
survey, the hay had been cut and removed. The sediments encountered in this trench (Table 5,
Figure 13) were very similar to those in Trench 3. The water table, however, was reached at 3 m
bs.

Trench 5
Trench 5 was placed approximately 170 m southeast of Trench 4 and 50 m east of the canal,
positioning it within the western corner of the recently plowed cornfield. Trench 5 displayed
sediments that had more clay content and were generally darker than those found in the other
trenches (Table 6, Figure 14). The water table was reached in this trench at 2.7 m bs.

Shovel Testing
Shovel tests, with the exception of those at the northern end of the proposed barge slip area where
sandy sediments were encountered near the surface, displayed a dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam
that generally became impassable at approximately 60 cm bs. In some instances, calcium
carbonate deposits were discovered between 45 and 60 cm bs. No cultural materials were found
in any of these shovel tests.

SURVEY AREA 2
Survey Area 2 encompassed approximately 120 acres adjacent to the southeastern side of the
proposed mooring slip location. The survey area consisted of a mown hayfield (with the
exception of the extreme northern corner), and the adjacent southwestern two-thirds of the
plowed cornfield (see Figure 9). Survey Area 2 was considered to have a low probability for
cultural resources because of its distance from the projected location of a potential paleochannel.
The area was inspected through pedestrian transects and judgmental shovel testing.

Survey of this area consisted of walking 52 transects, spaced 15 m apart, over the entire area. In
addition, 20 judgmental shovel tests were excavated in select locations across Survey Area 2 to
gain subsurface data in areas with thicker ground cover or to further explore locations with visible
surficial cultural materials (e.g., glass, burned clay, etc.). Eight shovel tests were placed in the
plowed cornfield, and 12 were placed in the mown hayfield.

Pedestrian Transects
Investigations through pedestrian survey identified four locations with broken glass fragments or
burned clay fragments. Shovel tests were placed in these areas, but no features were located.
Two localities were identified on the fringe of the survey area. The localities consist of a bottle
dump and a hunting blind, both found in the woods on the northernwestern edge of Survey Area
2.
In addition to the localities, a riding, farm implement, likely a dump rake, was discovered on the
area’s southeastern edge, on a tree-lined grass strip that served as a property marker between the
plowed cornfield of Survey Area 2 and an adjacent field to the southeast. The iron rake
implement was photographed (Figure 15) and its location was recorded, but the piece of
equipment was not considered a locality. Each spoked wheel of the horse-drawn rake stood 4.5 ft
(1.4 m) tall, and the axle, with a metal seat extending above, measured 12.5 ft (3.8 m) long.
Below the seat was a bar perpendicular to the axle for harness attachments. This bar also held
levers and metal springs to control the rake. This piece of farm equipment appeared intact, as all
of its parts seemed to be in good order, but it bore no markings to ascertain specific dates for its
use or manufacture.

Locality 1—Glass Bottle Dump
Locality 1 was found on the edge of a wooded area, approximately 5 m north of the hayfield in
Survey Area 2. The dump measured 12.5 ft (3.8 m) north/south by 9 ft (2.7 m) east/west and
contained over 60 glass bottles and jars (Figure 16). One of the jars appeared to be a Heinz baby
food jar with a screw-on vacuum cap. Heinz began making baby food in 1931 (Tinytum 2008),
but only began using screw-on vacuum lids on baby food jars in the late 1950s (Tri-City Herald
1959). Thus, the Heinz baby food jar with a screw-on cap could date to anytime subsequent to
the late 1950s. Although baby food jars made up the majority of the items at the dump, a few
other glass containers such as “Mason” type canning jars, ketchup bottles, and various other
unknown types were also found. In addition, this locality held a couple of rusted metal coffee
cans and miscellaneous metal scraps. The integrity of this dump appeared intact, but the date that
the dump was deposited or by whom was not evident. It does, however, suggest a mid-to late
twentieth century usage.

Locality 2—Hunting Blind
Locality 2 was within the woods on the northwestern edge of Survey Area 2, approximately 20 m
(66 ft) north of the mowed hayfield. This locality was approximately 110 m (361 ft) east of the
Victoria Barge Canal and consisted of several corrugated metal sheets set upright against wooden
corner posts to form a square (Figure 17). Within this square was a metal folding chair and a
small tree. The square measured 5.5 ft (1.7 m) north/south by 3.5 ft (1.1 m) east/west and stood

2.5 ft (.76 m) high. The structure’s metal walls were nailed into 2-x-4" wooden boards that
served as corner posts. The northwest corner post had been removed and lay north of the
structure. Several metal panels, which may have provided the structure with higher walls, or even
a roof, were strewn around the locality. None of the materials associated with the structure
provided any indication of age. The poor condition of the possible hunting blind suggested that
this blind has probably been in disuse for at least several years.

Shovel Testing
The shovel test sediments in Survey Area 2 generally matched those found in Survey Area 1
shovel tests. The upper 50–60 cm in each shovel test displayed a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay
loam. Below this layer, a dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay was found to the bottom of the shovel test at
approximately 80 cm bs. As in Survey Area 1 shovel tests, calcium carbonate deposits were
occasionally seen between 45 and 60 cm bs. Burned clay was occasionally found on the surface
and in the upper 20 cm of some of the shovel tests in the plowed cornfield, but this material may
simply be the result of field burning.

SURVEY AREA 3
Survey Area 3 consisted of approximately 54 acres within the project area thought to have a high
potential for cultural resources because of its proximity to the potential paleochannel in the area
and because of its proximity to small bluffs east of the project area. The survey area
encompassed the northernmost corner of the mown hayfield and the northeastern one-third of the
plowed cornfield (see Figure 9). Survey Area 3 consisted primarily of the portion of the project
area east of the 15-ft contour line marked on the USGS topographic. The survey area was
investigated through pedestrian transects, a combination of hand-excavated and, because of very
wet and impenetrable soil, backhoe-excavated shovel tests, and backhoe trenches.

Shovel Testing
In total, 186 shovel tests were excavated in Survey Area 3; 10 units in the northern corner of the
adjacent mown hayfield and 176 shovel tests at 30-m intervals along 17 transects spaced 30 m
apart in the northeastern one-third of the plowed cornfield. Seventy-six shovel tests were dug
along Transects 1–8 in the northeastern portion of the plowed cornfield during very wet
conditions in very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam sediments (Figure 18). At depths between 50
and 60 cm bs, a dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay layer appeared that proved extremely difficult to
excavate by hand. Consequently, most of the shovel tests were terminated upon reaching this
level.
After completion of the shovel testing on the first eight transects, rain saturated the field, forcing
the postponement of testing for more than two weeks. Upon returning to the project area and
encountering extremely wet and clayey conditions, a backhoe was used to excavate the remaining
100 shovel tests on Transects 9–17; backhoe-excavated shovel tests extended to a depth of 1 m
(Figure 19). These holes followed the stratigraphic pattern seen in the previous shovel tests. A
very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam persisted through the first 50 or 60 cm. Below the first
layer, a dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay layer extended to the bottom of the shovel test. In several of

the tests, the upper 20–40 cm of the clay layer was mottled with yellowish brown (10YR 5/6)
redox concentrations. In some instances, charcoal fragments and/or calcium carbonate deposits
were also seen within the clay layer. Many of these shovel tests encountered the water table,
causing the holes to partially fill with water. This, however, did not prevent screening of the
removed sediments. Except for a brick fragment found on the surface of Shovel Test 13, Transect
16 (near the southeastern edge of the field), no cultural materials were recovered from shovel
testing in Survey Area 3.

Trenching
In order to better assess the potential for more deeply buried cultural materials in Survey Area 3,
the Project Archeologist used the backhoe to excavate seven trenches, six in the cornfield and one
in the northernmost corner of the adjacent mown hayfield (see Figure 9). Each trench was
excavated to the water table, which usually was encountered between 1.5 m and 2 m bs. In
Trench 11, the backhoe reached the water table at 1 m, but in Trench 12, it was not apparent until
below 2 m. All of the trenches were aligned along a north/south line, except for Trench 10,
which was positioned east/west. Trench numbering was sequential from trenches in Survey Area
1. No artifacts or features were seen in any of the trenches in Survey Area 3.

Trench 6
Trench 6 was positioned on a north/south line near the northwest corner of Survey Area 3 in the
plowed cornfield. Trench 6 displayed sediments that were similar to those witnessed in the
shovel tests. The redox concentrations were recorded as being darker than seen in the shovel tests
or in the trenches from Survey Area 1, but this may have been due to the overcast and wetter
conditions experienced on the day that these trenches were dug (Table 7, Figure 20).

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY OF RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The cultural resources investigation documented in this report was undertaken with three primary
management goals in mind:
1. to locate all historic and prehistoric cultural resources occurring within the designated
project area;
2. to evaluate the significance of these resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP; and
3. to make recommendations for the treatment of these resources in relation to the proposed
undertaking, based on their NRHP evaluations.
The 193-acre Victoria Barge Canal proposed mooring facility project area was subdivided into
three survey areas based on the potential for intact subsurface cultural deposits. These areas were
investigated through a total of 72 pedestrian transects, 222 shovel tests, and 12 backhoe trenches.
The only cultural resources identified were in Survey Area 2 and consisted of widely scattered,
isolated glass fragments and burned clay fragments on the surface of the field as well as two
historic localities: a glass bottle dump and a hunting blind. The areas around the glass fragments
and burned clay were shovel-tested, but no subsurface cultural material was found. The burned
clay was considered the result of field burns.
Both localities were discovered on the northwestern edge of Survey Area 2. The bottle dump,
Locality 1, approximately 12.5-x-9 ft, contained primarily baby food jars, one of which might be
attributable to a Heinz baby food jar with a vacuum seal screw-on cap, which Heinz began using
in the late 1950s. Mason type canning jars, ketchup bottles, rusted coffee cans, and
miscellaneous untyped bottles and metal scraps comprised the other materials. None of these
could be accurately dated to suggest when the materials might have been manufactured or
deposited, or by whom, but do suggest a mid to late twentieth-century usage. Locality 2, the
hunting blind remnant, consisted of several upright corrugated metal sheets nailed to wooden 2-x4 corner posts. The 5.5-x-3.5 ft structure, at a height of 2.5 ft, enclosed a folding chair and a
small tree. The disassembled northwest corner post lay to the north, and several other metal
sheets scattered about could have possibly formed parts of higher walls or a roof. No indication
of the date of construction or use was found. The vicinity of each locality was shovel-tested, but
no subsurface cultural materials were identified in any of the shovel tests. No materials from
these localities were collected. Each locality and any associated materials identified during this
survey were fully recorded using notes, photographs, and a GPS unit.
47

Neither the localities nor the widely scattered, occasional, surficial glass fragments and burned
clay meet the criteria for designation as a site. Therefore, none of these resources can be
considered for National Register inclusion or SAL designation, and no further archeological work
is necessary within the project area. It is recommended that construction of the proposed mooring
facility and the associated deposition of excavated material on adjacent land along the Victoria
Barge Canal would have no effect on historic archeological properties in the APE.
