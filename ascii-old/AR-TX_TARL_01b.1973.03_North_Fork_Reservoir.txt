IN TROD UC TION

From October 22 to December 16, 1968, the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (now the Texas Archeological Survey)
undertook a program of test excavations at eight sites in the
proposed basin of the North Fork Reservoir, North Fork San
Gabriel River, Texas.

This work, carried out in cooperation

with the National Park Service as part of the Inter-agency
Archeological Salvage Program, represented the third season
in the reservoir area.

In 1963, a brief preliminary recon-

naissance was completed (Shafer and Corbin 1965) and in 1967
two sites were excavated (Sorrow 1969; 1970) by the same
agency.
Prior to the 1967 season in the North Fork Reservoir,
most of the archeological investigations in central Texas
had been heavily directed toward constructing regionally
applicable chronological sequences.

The sequence presently

utilized, one which is keyed to time-diagnostic projectile
point types and relatable to the North Fork Reservoir area,
was developed as a result of archeological salvage activities
in the Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir basin on the nearby
Lampasas River (Sorrow, Shafer and Ross 1967).

A less specific

sequence had previously been described for the Canyon
Reservoir in Comal County (Johnson, Suhm and Tunnell 1962:
118-121).

The similarities between the sequences in these

widely separated localities have resulted in the suggestion
that the Stillhouse Hollow sequence is probably representative
for most or all of central Texas

(So~row,

Shafer and Ross 1967:

144).

The sequence is divided into ten units,each of which is
characterized by one or more distinctive projectile point
types (Sorrow, Shafer and Ross 1967: Fig. 72).

Since there

will be repeated reference to this sequence, it is reconstructed in Table 1.
Currently these time periods represent useful constructs
within which to consider the regional archeological phenomena.
Investigations into the archeology of the North San Gabriel
River valley have used the Stillhouse Hollow sequence as a
chronological framework and no excavations have thus far been
directed toward verifying or altering it.

As yet only· two'-

sites- have been.investigated and reported in published form.

The Barker Site (Sorrow 1970) is a small, late site

with the diagnostic material here equating principally with
Period X of the Stillhouse Hollow sequence (Table 1).

This

site appears to have been a special purpose site, perhaps
concerned with hide preparation or some other activity
associated with hunting.
The test excavations reported here are a continuation of
this research plan.

The sitESselected for tests were those

that appeared to represent a single component occupation (that
is, single time period) and/or those that might offer an
opportunity for functional analysis.

Environmental Setting

That part of the North San Gabriel River in which the proposed lake is to be located is within the Lampasas Cut Plain,
a unit of the Great Plains province (Fenneman 1938: 106).
Briefly, the Lampasas Cut Plain is described as a "submaturely
dissected limestone plateau."

Local relief is fairly pro-

nounced along valley walls ranging from steep slopes to vertical cliffs.
All of the sites tested are within the confines of the
canyon walls on alluvial terraces.

Vegetation on the terraces

ranges from small isolated groves of hardwoods along the streamside, open pastureland and cultivated land on the main body of
the terraces, to dense cedar thickets on the rocky soils at the
backs of the terraces.
The climate is characterized by hot summers and cool winters.
The mean annual temperature is 68 degrees, and the average rainfall is 33 inches with the heaviest rains occurring from April
through June.

A more detailed description of the environmental

setting can be found in Sorrow 1969.

THE SITES

41 WM 33

Site 41 WM 33 is buried in an alluvial terrace overlooking the North San Gabriel River.,

The site is situated

on the north side of the river at its junction with a short,
deep, meandering gully 9 1/2 river miles upstream from the
confluence of the North San Gabriel and the South San Gabriel rivers (Fig. 1).

The gully cuts through the terrace

deposit at an acute angle to the river channel leaving a
peninsula-like projection between the main part of the gully
and the river.

A ranch road bisects the point leading down

to the river.

It was along the road cut in the vicinity of

the eroded peninsula-like projection that flint flakes and
other artifacts were found during the reconnaissance of the
reservoir area (Shafer and Corbin 1965: 12).
The terrace in the vicinity of Site 41 WM 33 is relatively narrow and its surface has little relief along the river;
however, it rises gradually in elevation at the back toward the
rugged limestone walls of the North San Gabriel valley.

Al-

though most of the surface is covered in grass, trees (primarily

8

-----

--

hardwoods) are scattered along the gully becoming sparse
along the front edge of the terrace.

A vacant rock dwelling

is situated west of the pasture road approximately 150 feet
from the edge of the terrace.

Testing Procedure

The heavily eroded point formed by the gully and the
river channel coupled with the relatively small space and the
presence of the pasture road made it impossible to test in undisturbed deposits.

Although no material had been noted west

of the point on the relatively flat alluvial terrace, it was
decided that testing would be done in that area.

Our tests

were aimed at determining whether or not the occupation extended into the terrace proper, and if so and depending on
its nature, whether it would be profitable to return to the
site for more intensive investigations.
Two 5-foot square test units were established parallel
to the river and approximately 110 feet apart.

Test Pit 1 was

located between the meandering gully and the river on an
apparently undisturbed level area of the terrace: Test Pit 2
was situated upstream between the rock house and the river.
Each unit was taken down in arbitrary 0.5 of a foot
levels.

Test Pit 1 was excavated through Level 4 (2.0 feet)

---- - - - - - -

and Test Pit 2 through Level 5 (2.5 feet).

The fill was

screened through 1/3-inch mesh hardware cloth, and all material from each level was bagged separately.

Excavation was

halted when the returns (mostly flint flakes) becanescarce.

Internal Structure

The profiles exposed in both test pits revealed a homogenous deposit of alluvium (Fig. 4 A).
calcareous clay loam.

The soil was a friable,

The upper 12 to 18 inches were dark,

grayish-brown in color, fading to a yellowish-brown toward the
bottom of the test units.

The soil is identified as Catalpa

clay loam (Templin and others 1938: map).

Only rarely were

burned rocks or snail shells visible in the test pit walls.

Occupational~Eeatures

Three concentrations of burned limestone were recorded.
Two (Fig. 4 B) were found during the excavation of Test Pit 1
and the third was located in Test Pit 2 (Fig. 4 A).

The Test

Pit 1 features are identified as hearths; whereas, the function
of the Test Pit 2 feature could not be definitely ascertained.
The hearths found while excavating Test Pit 1 were located just outside the northeast corner of the excavation unit.
The lower of the two hearths was found first as it extended

10

into the test unit.

The second (upper) hearth overlapped the

lower hearth and was found during the excavation of an irregular extension of Test Pit 1 to expose the lower hearth.
The upper hearth was contained within Level 1 (surface to
0.5 of a foot).

It consisted of a roughly circular concentra-

tion of burned rock and appeared to have been scattered
(possibly by subsequent eultivation of the terrace)as only one
rock remained undisturbed.

The one rock was broken into five

fragments, all of which remained in correct juxtaposition
with one another.

No other rocks in the upper hearth exhibit

this condition.
The lower hearth was contained within Level 2 (0.5 to
1.0 foot below the surface).

It was circular in outline,

measuring 2.3 feet by 2.8 feet.
rocks had not been disturbed.

The tight concentration of
With the exception of the occa-

sional stacking of several rocks, the general form is that of
a shallow basin or depression.

Although most of the rocks are

not fractured, there are several exceptions.

Many of the

rocks in the lower hearth are rounded river cobbles; whereas
no river cobbles were noted in the upper hearth.
Most of the upper hearth was removed while exposing the
lower hearth.

The latter was left intact in the event it

would be possible to return to the site for more intensive
investigations.

No charcoal, bone or shell was found in the
11

immediate hearth areas, but one projectile point (Fig. 7 K}
was found at the northwest edge of the lower hearth.
The burned rock concentration in Test Pit 2 was located
within Level 5 (2.0 to 2.5 feet below the surface}.

This

feature is a loose concentration of rocks extending into the
north wall of the test pit and appears to represent a portion
of a scattered hearth.

No attempt was made to expose the

remainder of the feature so there can be no final statement
on its form or function.

Discussion and Recommendations

Table 2 provides a list of the artifacts recovered from
41 WM 33 and indicates their vertical provenience.

Only three

stemmed biface types are present--Ensor, Castroville and Marcos.
These are representatives of a class of artifacts usually
thought to be the most sensitive as chronological indicators
within the Texas Archaic.

If the obtained sample is indicative

of the site's chronological position, then 41 WM 33 falls
within Period VII of the central Texas sequence.

As such the

site appears to represent a time period not well known in the
immediate vicinity.
Assuming the sample obtained is characteristic of the
site, then additional excavations would offer an opportunity to

12

examine this time period in terms of associated artifacts and
economic pursuits (as indicated from tools).

The internal

structure of the site is such that there is little chance to
recognize living surfaces.

Consequently, the relationships

between artifacts and artifact groups will of necessity be
stated statistically.

The possibility is excellent of ob-

taining a related artifact inventory and examining the nature
and distribution of more permanent occupational features,
such as hearths in relation to artifact distributions.
Examination of the major artifact categories in Table 2
reveals that there are no ground stone artifacts.

All of the

unstemmed biface artifacts are thought to be rejects or to
have been broken during manufacture.

Only two of the more

formalized scraper types are represented and only three artifacts that are thought to have functioned as knives (Uniface
Artifacts II).

The amount of manufacturing debris is suffi-

cient to indicate that all stages of manufacturing were carried
out here, even though no manufacturing tools (that is, hammerstones) were found.
It is difficult to assess the significance of these observations primarily because the validity of the sample is
questionable as being representative of the site. However, since

13

evaluative testing, characteristically, is often inconclusive,
this site warrants further testing.

41 WM 34

Site 41 WM 34 is buried in an alluvial terrace on the
south side of the North San Gabriel River 11 miles upstream
from the junction of the North San Gabriel with the South
San Gabriel River.

The terrace in this area is relatively

narrow as the river flows near the south valley wall.
The north face of the terrace is a cutbank in which the
occupation was noted as a thin lens of sparsely scattered
burned rock, dark brown stained soil, and the presence of a
hearth (Fig. 4 D).

Occupation was noted for nearly 25 yards

along this exposure.

A ranch road parallels the cut bank

eventually turning south cutting through the site at the east
end of the terrace, leaving only a small, eroded, remnant of
the site east of the road (Fig. 2 B).
The site area west of the road is almost entirely in that
part of the terrace that has been under extensive cultivation.
The remnant of the site east of the road has not been cultivated, but erosion has left only a small part of this area intact.
A large gully marks the eastern extremity of this section
of the terrace system.

The gully curls behind the site remnant

What appears to be a deflated sur-

within 20-25 feet of the ranch road.

Testing Procedure

Test excavations were limited to the area of the site
east of the ranch road.

The extensive cultivation of the

main part of the terrace precluded the opportunity to test
the large area of the site.

The margins of this area were

also not tested as the fence would have been endangered by
any excavations along the terrace edge.
A 5-foot square excavation unit (Test Pit 1) was located
near the head of the gully in the deflated area.

The exca-

vations in this area were intended as a check on the lower
levels of the terrace.

Test Pit 1 was taken down

(to a depth of 1.0 foot).

levels

The only material encountered was

a few flint flakes from Level 1.

All fill was screened

through 1/2-inch hardware cloth.
The second excavation unit (Test Pit 2) was located on
top of the terrace remnant (Fig. 2 B).

This unit was exca-

vated in such a way as to leave all occupational debris in
situ when possible.

Unfortunately, the only debris of

17

sufficient size to treat in this manner was a large number
fire-cracked limestone rocks.

In addition to the careful

trowelling cf this unit, all fill was screened resulting in the
recovery of numerous small flint flakes.

Internal Structure

Like the other terraces of the North San Gabriel River,
the terrace at 41 WM 34 is an accumulation of alluvial deposits.

All of the terrace deposits have been identified as

Catalpa clay loam (Templin and others 1938).

The cutbank pro-

vided easy access to a cross section of the terrace deposit
(Fig . 4

c ID)

•

Occupational Features

Test Pit 1 yielded nothing of considered importance.

The

excavations in Test Pit 2 did reveal a relatively thin layer
of burned hearth stones.

The restricted nature of the excava-

tion and the fact that the rocks were several layers thick
made it impossible to ascertain any discrete feature.
The only definite occupational feature noted was the
hearth located in the cutbank of the terrace west of the
ranch road (Fig. 4 D).

The hearth, in profile, was slightly

basin-shaped and approximately 3.5 feet in width.

Discussion and Recommendations

Excavations at this site yielded little other than
manufacturing debris and a random scattering of burned rock.
For the most part, all of this material was confined to Test
Pit 2.

Due to the extreme limitations of the physical test

and the lack of diagnostic material, conclusive evaluation
of the site was not possible.

However, the occupation is

extensive and, should the opportunity arise, it is recommended
that tests be made in the area currently under cultivation.
Sites known to have potential for yielding significant information should have first _priority :_f-<;>'r -:cfutlil:'e in:ve-st·i-gat:i,_oris,

41 WM 56

Site 41 WM 56 is buried in the front of an alluvial
terrace on the south side of the North San Gabriel River
approximately 9 3/4 river miles from the confluence of the
North and the South San Gabriel rivers.

The interior

surface of the terrace is currently in coastal bermuda grass
and serves as pasture for stock.

Previously, the terrace has

been extensively cultivated.

Testing Procedure

'I\vo 5-foot square test units were dug in arbitrary
levels.

The fill from Test Pit 1 was passed through 1/2-inch

mesh hardware cloth; whereas

the fill from Test Pit 2 was

passed through 1/4-inch mesh hardware cloth.

Each test unit

was dug to a depth of 2 1/2 feet below the surface (through
Level 5).
The test pits were located on the presumed undisturbed
part of the terrace between the fence and the terrace edge.
Test Pit 1 (Fig. 5 B) was situated along the east end of the
terrace next to the intermittent stream channel.

Along the

north edge of the terrace was Test Pit 2 (Fig. 5 A)--approximately 90 feet north-northwest of Test Pit 1.

Internal Structure

Like Site 41 WM 33, the alluvial terrace here presents
a homogenenous, calcareous clay loam accumulation of sedi-

23

ments in which occupational debris is interspersed.

No

trace of cultural zoning was found in the Test Pit walls
as the only anomolies were random occurrences of snail shells,
burned rock fragments and flint flakes.

Occupational Features

Within Level 1 (surface to 1/2-foot) there was a lens
of burned limestone fragments.

The rocks covered most of

the unit, but no discernible pattern was noted. They were
removed to facilitate rapid testing of the site.

Discussion and Recommendations

The diagnostic artifacts (Table 3) from this site
equate to Period VIII of the Stillhouse Hollow sequence (Table 1).
Other bif acially chipped artifacts are considered to be production rejects and as such are not tools.

Less formal tools present include a relatively

small number of utilized flakes.

Concommitant with the acti-

vities normally proscribed to a ha:rnrrerstone, manufacturing
debris is present.

Although this site is situated similarly to 41 WM 33 with
respect to the river, there are marked differences in the
artifact sample.

The most obvious difference is the types

of stemmed bifaces present.

Other differences. no lessc:. ,_

important, are the presence of a variety of scraping tools
and the presence of grinding implements at 41 WM 56.

Neither

site yielded many artifacts considered to be knives.
This site is worthy of further examination for the
sames reasons as 41 WM 33.

In addition, it is possible that

functional differences as indicated by the varying kinds
of tools at the sites will be discernible.

41 WM 57

Site 41 WM 57 is situated on an alluvial terrace on the
south side of the North San Gabriel River across the intermittent stream from Site 41 WM 56 (Fig. 1).

The primary feature

of the site is a tight cluster of three burned rock middens
located in an area of the terrace under intensive cultivation
(Fig.3A).
The terrace in this area is relatively wide--about 1300
feet.

The midden cluster

is situated approximately half way

between the river and the.back-of the ter\l:ac€.

All of the middens and the areas in the immediate vicinity had been heavily plowed.

About 100 feet west of the

midden were located several ranch buildings and corrals in an
area that was not under cultivation.

It was in this relatively

undisturbed area that most of the test excavations were
conducted.

Testing Procedure

Two 5-foot square excavation units were juxtaposed in
the barn area west of the site and a third was partially
excavated in a previously cultivated part of the terrace at
the north edge of the plowed field

Most of the

fill was passed 1/4-inch mesh hardware cloth.
In addition to the test excavations, an intensive surface
collection of the area around the burned rock middens was
made.

No attempt was made to separate the collections from

each midden as it was assumed that the intensive plowing
had negatively influenced horizontal distributions.

Internal Structure

Only the two test excavations in the barnyard west of
the burned rock middens were taken down a sufficient depth

Zone 3 extended down through the lower limits of

Artifacts including flint flakes, were found throughout
the 3.5 feet of excavations.

Most were collected from 1.0 to

1.5 feet below the surface, which for the most part corresponds to Zone 2.

The lowest level yielded only sparse lithic

material.

Occupational Features

No specific features were noted; however, burned rock
was present in all excavation units.

No serious attempts

were made to expose large areas of burned rock after it had
31

been determined that the rocks present were not in place in
relation to an original occupational feature such as a hearth.

Discussion and Recommendations

One of the principal reasons this site was selected for
testing was the presence of multiple middens.

It was

anti-

cipated that each midden could be examined in order to contrast
one with the other.

Unfortunately, circumstances did not allow

this and the tests were largely confined to a portion of the
terrace undisturbed by cultivation.
Based on the Stillhouse Hollow sequence (Table 1), the
chronologically diagnostic.: stemmed bifaces (Bulverde, Castroville. Darl, Ensor, Fairland, Frio, Marcos, Marshall, Nolan
and Pedernales)collected from the surface and the test excavations indicate that this locality was occupied for about
4000 years

(that is, from circa 3500 B.C.

to A.D. 500 -Table 3).

This corresponds with Periods V-VIII in that chronology.
A wide variety of tool categories was collected (Table 3).
In addition to stemmed bifaces, these include several unstemmed bifaces (Bifaces l, 3 and 4) that have served as tools,
scrapers (Uniface Artifacts I), knives (Unifaces Artifacts
II), milling slabs, hammerstones, and utilized flakes.

A

large amount of manufacturing debris was also rec::>vered.
That a wide range of activities was carried out here is evi32
-~~--

---- - - -

~------

dent; unfortunately, there is little evidence to indicate
whether any of these activities is confined to, or is more
prevalent during any one time period.
The excavations in the area west of the midden cluster
offer some promise of isolating material representative
of Period VI of the Stillhouse Hollow sequence.

This period

is characterized by the projectile point type Pedernales.
The profile {Fig. 5 D) of the units reveal a thin lens of
occupational debris.

Relatively few artifacts were found

above or below this lens.

This lens was excavated as Level 3

within the test excavations.

Though not discernable in

Table 3 because it includes Test Pit 3, this lens yielded
five Pedernales points and one Ensor point. Othe.r tools found
include a single side scraper {Variety 1) and two possible
knives {Uniface Artifacts II, varieties 1 and 3).
No ground stone tools were found.

It is possible that

more extensive examination of this area would yield important
information about tool complexes at this time period.

However,

since this in only one part of the total site area, and since
the midden cluster has been severly disturbed, it is not
recommended that this question be investigated at this site.

41 WM 73

Site 41 WM 73, a single burned rock midden located on
an alluvial terrace on the north side of the North San Gabriel River, is approximately 12 river miles upstream from
the confluence of the North and South San Gabriel rivers
(Fig. 1).

The midden is situated at the back of the

terrace at the base of a low, gently sloping, limestone hill.
The relatively flat surface of the terrace is mostly in
grass and dotted with cedar trees.

Some hardwoods occur

along a gully west of the midden at the front edge of the
terrace.

Testing Procedure

Four 5-foot square excavation units and two backhoe
trenches were dug (Fig. 2 A).

All units were dug in arbi-

trary 1/2-foot levels with the fill passed through 1/2-inch
mesh hardware cloth.
Test Pit 1, excavated through Level 7 (3.5 feet), was
located 25 feet southeast of the burned rock midden.

Test

Pit 2 was excavated through Level 2 and was approximately
430 feet south-southwest of the midden.

Test Pit 3 (which

was excavated through Level 4) was located 55 feet southsouthwest of the midden.

Test Pit 4, about 100 feet west

3o

of the burned rock midden, was excavated through Level 6.
One backhoe trench, oriented north-northeast to southsouthwest, extended from the south edge of the burned rock midden toward the river into the terrace proper.

The second

backhoe trench was dug at the southwest corner of the terrace
in conjunction with Test Pit 2 and was oriented perpendicular to the river roughly in the same directions as the first
backhoe trench (Fig. 2 A).

Internal Structure

Test Pit 1 revealed three distinct zones.

The lowest

zone was a brown-yellow calcareous clay, the top of which
was encountered approximately 2 feet below the surface and
extended to tl:Ebottom of the excavation unit.

Few artifacts

were recovered from the zone.
The middle zone of Test Pit 1 was distinguised primarily by the presence of a sparse line of angular burned rock
fragments.

The matrix was a darker brown than was the lower

zone, probably a result of being transitional between the
upper and lower zones rather than the presence of occupational
debris.
facts.

The middle zone yielded the greatest number of artiThe top of this zone was noted at about 1.5 feet be-

low the surface.

37

The upper zone is a dark brown, heavy clay or clay loam.
It contained many small limestone fragments and some cultural
debris.
The same general pattern is present in all of the test
excavations in the area of the burned rock midden (including the backhoe trench}.

The differences in the profiles of

these exposures are the various thicknesses of the upper and
middle zone.

The middle zone becomes visibly more dense and

thicker as it approaches the burned rock midden.

Occupational Features

Typical of the other sites in the area of the proposed
North Fork Reservoir, the occupational features at 41 WM 73
consist of accumulations of burned rock limestone fragments.
The scattered burned rock fragments in Test Pits 1 and 4 revealed no pattern; therefore, no time was spent in exposing
all the rocks in either unit.

The greatest number of rocks

was noted in Test Pit 1 (east of the midden}; whether this
is a function of greater utilization of the area east of the
midden, or distance from the midden in the case of Test Pit
2, is not known.

midden to the south revealed a partial cross section of the
midden.

The midden itself is viewed as an occupational

feature in that a similar accumulation (the John Ischy Site,
Sorrow 1969) has been shown to represent an intentional
feature occupying a specific part of the total site area.
Although the function of these features has not been established, a reasonable interpretation suggests they were either
cooking areas or "dump" areas.

Burned rocks are scattered

southward from the midden, but testing did not indicate
heavy utilization of that area.

Discussion and Recommendations
Test excavations indicate that a thin subsurface lens of burned
rock surrounds the midden on three sides.

Most of the arti-

facts recovered were found within this vertical unit.

The

chronologically diagnostic artifacts were principally
Pedernales points.

Few other tool categories (Table 5) are

well represented that can be definitely be attributed to
this period (Period VI of the Stillhouse Hollow sequence).
Since this site is relatively undisturbed and presumably
offers an opportunity to examine a limited time span occupation in conjunction with a burned rock midden, it is reccommended that extensive excavations be urdertaken prior to
its being innundated by the North Fork Reservoir.
40

------~---·---~-------

41 WM 87

Site 41 WM 87 is located on the front edge of an alluvial terrace on the south side of the North San Gabriel River,
8 river miles upstream from the confluence of the North and
South San Gabriel rivers (Fig. 1).

The site area is situ-

ated at the point of the terrace formed by the junction of
a small intermittent creek and the river.

Occupational

debris was collected from an area of about 3 acres; the main
concentration was along a ridge of the terrace paralleling
the river (Shafer and Corbin 1965).

Testing Procedure

Two backhoe trenches averaging 15 feet in length and 8
feet in depth were dug perpendicular to the river and along
the ridge from which most of the surface collections had been
made.

The trenches were intended to isolate any occupation

that might be present.

One was situated near the corner of

the terrace, and the other was approximately 100 yards upstream.

The profiles of both were examined, but neither

revealed any evidence of occupation.

41

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41 WM 87 was the first site tested in the 1968
field season, and the first site in the reservoir area to
be tested which was situated on the front edge of a terrace.
Subsequent testing at Sites 41 WM 33 and WM 56 made it painfully evident that simple backhoe tests were not adequate
to assess the presence or absence of subsurface occupations.
The profiles obtained in the hand excavated units at the
latter site were not particularly instructive and the primary evidence of occupation at those sites was obtained by
actual test excavations.

Thus a conclusive assessment of

the archeological potential at Site 41 WM 87 cannot be
given at this time.

41 WM 88

Site 41 WM 88 is a small burned rock midden located
approximately 700 feet west of Site 41 WM 87 and is situated
at the back of an alluvial terrace (of which Site 41 WM 87
is a part) at the base of a low, gently sloping portion of
the valley wall (Fig. 1).

The site is visible on the sur-

face as a small circular rise and might not have attracted
the attention of the surveyors had a ranch road not cut

42

--------------------------

- -------------

through the east edge of the burned rock midden.

The valley

wall in the area of the site runs approximately northwest to
southeast.
This relatively undisturbed site sustained only minimal
damage by the ranch road.

In addition, there had been a

half-hearted attempt at digging in the central part of the
burned rock midden.

Testing Procedure

A grid system was superimposed over the site with reference to magnetic north.

The horizontal datum was established

east of the center of the burned rock midden and labeled
North 900/West 900.

All excavations were located and recor-

ded relative to this point (Fig. 3 B).
Test excavations were initiated next to a long northsouth backhoe trench (Fig. 3 B).

The first excavation units

were located east of the burned rock midden with subsequent
units located south of the midden along the north slope and
adjacent to the long backhoe trench.
were dug in 1/2-foot arbitrary levels.

All excavation units
The fill was passed

through 1/2-inch mesh hardware cloth.
Three backhoe trenches were dug:

the first originated

near the center of the burned rock midden and was oriented

43

north-south with the west side corresponding roughly to W925
grid line.

This trench was approximately 60 feet long and

obtained a miximum depth of 9.5 feet.

A second trench was

cut in an east-west direction parallel to the two excavation
units east of the road.

The north side of the second trench

which corresponded to the N897 grid line was 15 feet long and
had a miximum depth of 4 feet.

The third trench was dug

south of the burned rock midden in proximity to the excavation unit in that area.

It was approximately 16 feet long

and had a miximum depth of 6.5 feet.
The second and third backhoe trenches were dug in order
to supplement the excavation units in the areas involved.
Their purpose was to investigate the possibility of deep
occupations not revealed in the excavation units.

The purpose

of the first trench dug prior to excavations along the north
side of the burned rock midden was to provide a cross section
profile of the midden in relation to the surrounding terrace.

Internal Structure

The internal structure of the site is a composite of
cultural debris (mostly burned rock fragments), alluvial
deposition, and possibly some colluvial depositions as the

44

site is situated at the base of an eroded limestone hill.
The principal feature of the site is a thick accumulation of
burned rocks.

The top of this feature is visible on the

surface,. but its margins are covered by a dark brown, heavy
clay or clay loam.

Below this is a reddish-brown sandy clay.

A gray-brown contact between these zones is transitional.
Cultural evidence consists principally of burned rQck.

Away

from the midden this is usually found about 1 foot below the
surface.

The major concentrations average about 1 foot in

thickness.
The midden overlies the same subsoils as described above.
Near the center of the midden its thickness measures 3 to
3.5 feet.

Test excavations within the midden were situated

on the northern edge.

Here the profiles indicated a thin

overlying deposit of dark brown clay loam.

Beneath this,

beginning about .75 of a foot below the surface, was the
margin of the midden.
1.25 feet.

Thickness varied from 1.0 foot to

Below the midden occurred the reddish-brown

sandy clay.

Discussion and Recommendations

A wide range of stemmed biface forms have been recovered
from this site (Table 6).

Our excavations indicated that

Periods V-VIII of the Stillhouse Hollow sequence were represented.

Subsequent excavations by local amateurs have revealed

that still later periods were present (John Robinson,personal
communication) .
A wide range of activities must have been carried on at
this locality as scraping, cutting, grinding, and manufacturing tools and debris were recovered.

Numerous scraper forms

were found, but few of these were tteformalized end scraper
type.

Presumed-to-be knives (Uniface Artifacts II) were less

common then scraping tools (Uniface Artifacts I).

Although

grinding tools were recovered, their number is small, possibly indicative of economic dependence on hunting rather than
gathering.
Based on test results this site was considered to have
good potential for answering structural problems about
burned rock middens, even though a long temporal span was
indicated.

Subsequent to our tests, local amateurs excavated

here and most of the site area has now been examined.

Their

results would indicate that horizontal distribution studies
would prove fruitful, as they found that the more recent
projectile point types clustered farther from the midden.
Since this site has now been largely destroyed by this excavation, no further work appears possible.

Most of the site

Surface indications

included flint flakes, flint artifacts, and scattered burned
and unburned rocks.
The grass-covered terrace surface in front of the site
is relatively flat and utilized as pasture for livestock.
An upward slope in the terrace area of the site is characterized by rocky soil and had not been cultivated.

The presence

of rock in the site area is probably due to rock fall.
Rock litter and occasional artifacts extend outward
from the tree line approximately 90 feet, and along the
limestone bluff for approximately 375 feet.

No distance

was calculated for the width of the site from the front
edge of the trees to the limestone bluff.

Behind the site

at the base of the bluff is a small run off.

Testing Procedure

natural rock.
profile.

Little occupational debris was noted in the

Consequently, the zoning noted in these trenches,

which was duplicated in the hand-excavated tests, could
not be correlated with occupational activity at the site.
Three 5-foot square test units were dug in arbitrary
1/2-foot levels.

Test Pits 1 and 3 were located outside

the cedar thicket and Test Pit 2 was situated near the
middle of the thicket. All fill was passed through 1/2-inch
mesh hardware cloth.

Internal Structure

The profile of the three excavation units could not
be directly related as there were differences from unit
to unit.

Furthermore, the units were some distance from

one another. The same general pattern, however, was present
in each.
The general structure of the profiles revealed a heavy,
dark, clayey soil extending from the surface to a depth of

52

------------

1 foot (Fig. 6 D). This was followed by a color transition
in which brown predominates.

Near the bottom of each pro-

file the clayey soil was a reddish-brown.

The bottom of

each profile had considerable amounts of softJcrumbly limestone in a yellow-brown clay matrix.
The profile of each test unit differed in that each
revealed varying sequences of rock deposition (both natural,
cultural, and combinations).

Discrimination between the

cultural units in the profiles are therefore partially based
on artifact return.

Discussion and Recommendations

The test excavations failed to indicate a locus of
cultural activity.

Possibly this is in part due to the dense

cedar thicket that covers most of the site area and to the
intensity of rock fall in this area.
The tests did indicate a wide range of activities were
carried on at this locale.

Activity-specific artifacts

found include stemmed bifaces (projectile points), scrapers,
knives, grinding implements, and manufacturing debris (Table 7).
The stemmed bifaces indicate the temporal span to encompass
Periods V and VII of the Stillhouse Hollow sequence.

53
---------

Undoubtedly 41 WM 115 has some interpretive significance,
but since there are other sites of the same chronological
periods that are less of an enigma (that is, the site features
are more easily determined), it is not recommended for further
investigation.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Test excavations were conducted at eight sites in the
area of the proposed North Fork Reservoir.

In terms of the

cultural chronology that has been suggested for the central
Texas region (Table 1), the occupations represented by the
time-diagnostic lithic materials from these sites range
from Period V through VII.

The presence of a possible

Lerma point (Fig. 8 0) at 41 WM 57 hints at an even earlier
occupation at this site.

However, the singularity of the

find and lack of any highly distinguishing attributes
associated with this type preclude any confident identification of the

specimen~

certainly it provides no good

evi~

dence, in any event, for attributing an older utilization of
the site.
The value of test or evaluative excavations of the type
described in this report resis on the premise that one or all
of at least three determinations can be made.

These are:

1) The approximate temporal span of occupation (s) should be
represented. 2) The functional character of the site can be
partially determined.

3) It can be ascertained whether or

not the site is sufficiently intact to warrant further

57

examination.

The latter determination is almost a necessity

in that few anthropological problems can be investigated if
a site is much disturbed.

Either of the former determina-

tions can be sufficient if number three is positive,
depending on the nature of research problems.
The results of the tests would .seem to indicate that
the later sites are located on or near the stream-facing
edge of the terrace.

Thus far five sites have been ex-

amined in this physiographic location--the four sites reported here and the Barker Site (Sorrow 1970) which has been
excavated.

Of the four sites reported here, two (41 WM 34

and 41 WM 87) failed to yield evidence of their position
within the chronological framework and two (41 WM 33 and
41 WM 56) are young.er than are the sites that occur toward
the back of the terraces.

The Barker Site is the latest

Indian site reported thus far from the area.

It yielded

arrow points and pottery indicative of Period X in the
utilized herein chronology (Table 1).

The significance of

these occurences has not yet been established; it is likely,
however, that it is a reflection of the sequence of terrace
building rather than a culturally patterned shift in site
location occasioned by subsistence procurement activities,
for example.

58

The older sites (41 WM 57, WM 73, WM 88 and WM 115)
are usually situated at the back of the terraces at the base
of the valley walls.

With one exception (41 WM 115), the

older sites are burned rock middens.

It is possible that

this site is a buried midden site, but the present condition
of the site and the absence of positive physical indications
of such a feature in any of the tests do not substantiate
such a conclusion.
Of the eight sites tested, three (41 WM 33, WM 56, and
WM 73) exhibited the greatest potential for meaningful archeological research.

Two sites (41 WM 57 and 41 WM 88) probably

had equally good potential previous to recent disturbance.
Site 41 WM 57 has been extensively plowed, and 41 WM 88 has
been thoroughly excavated by local amateurs subsequent to
our tests.

Neither of these sites is now considered to

be sufficiently intact to warrant further investigation.
Sites 41 WM 33, WM 56, and WM 73 are discussed in the
body of the report.

In terms of the three determinations

mentioned above, each has potential for meaningful research.
All are sufficiently intact, but more important, each offers
a unique opportunity to examine a part of a cultural system
as yet inadequately examined in central Texas.

59

The tests would indicate that 41 WM 33 is characterized
by a relatively short occupation and possibly had a specialized
function.

The presence of manufacturing debris and the

absence of tool forms such as scrapers and grinding tools
suggests utilization as a temporary hunting camp.

It is

quite possible that such .tools . ref]:e9t activity-specific areas
within the total site rather than relating to the site as a
whole.

This

is a reservation on the reliability of limited

evaluative testing which can only be resolved by additional
excavations.
Site 41 WM 56 is similar to 41 WM 33 in that it is
relatively late in the Archaic sequence and is situated on
the front edge of an alluvial terrace.

However, it differs

in that it was occupied for a longer period of time and exhibits a wider range of cultural activities.

In addition

to the manufacture of stone tools, these include subsistence
related activities implied by the presence of scraping and
grinding tools.

Presumably this is a reflection of numerous

repeated occupations for an extended length of time

or is

possibly a reflection of a more diverse population than was
postulated for 41 WM 33.
Site 41 WM 73 is situated at the rear of an alluvial
terrace at the base of a low limestone hill.

60

Based on the

test sample this site, which is characterized by the presence
of a burned rock midden, is slightly earlier than either site
41 WM 33 or 41 WM 56.
The importance of this site is heightened by the fact
that only a relatively short time span of occupation is indicated.

Also, this is a burned

roe~

midden site and, as

was pointed out in the report on the nearby John Ischy Site,
the understanding of this type of site awaits intensive investigation of a locality occupied for a relatively short
period of time (Sorrow 1969: 51).

The tests would indicate

that 41 WM 73 provides very good potential for meeting these
criteria.

Although indications are that several occupations

are present, it would appear that all occupations are related
in some way to the dominant central feature, the burned rock
midden.

Hopefully, additional excavations could answer many

of the questions raised by the John Ischy investigations.
These include:
1) What is the function of the burned rock midden?

Is

it a cooking area or is it simply residue from cooking or
heating hearths in other parts of the site?
2)

Can such sites be related to a particular economic

pursuit?

61

3) Can anything be said of the social unit responsible
for such features?
Certainly, careful investigation of sites such as 41 WM
73 can elicit some of these kinds of information.

Whether

or not the function of a burned rock midden is one or the
other of the possibilities mentioned. above or represents
some kind of communal cooking feature, or possibly something
as yet unconceived, can be in part approached by locating
definite hearth areas.

I would expect these features to be

situated away from the midden accumulation itself, but verification of this expectation would depend on the results of
additional excavation.
Whether or not such sites can be explained as the locus
of a particular economic pursuit, or (more likely) a range
of such activities, awaits excavation of a type as yet not
undertaken on a burned rock midden site.

This would involve

a broadened interdisciplinary approach.
The wide range of activities evidences at similar sites
examined in the past (Sorrow 1969: 49) would suggest that explanation of this kind of site on the basis of single or
multiple economic pursuits is insufficient.

More likely they

represent base camps for small bands or extended family groups

62

and were occupied for a substantial period of time.
Hopefully, a functional approach to investigation would
provide information relatable to questions of seasonality.
In summary, it is recommended that further excavations
be undertaken at sites 41 WM33, WM 56 and WM 73 and be
designed toward investigations of important functional
questions touched on above.

If priorities are to be assigned,

it is suggested that 41 WM 73 and at least one of the other
two be selected.

APPENDIX:

THE ARTIFACTS

The material collected from the test excavations will be
considered as a descriptive unit.

Hopefully this approach

will help ensure that any discrepancies which might arise in
grouping, and describing the aritfacts by site will be minimized.
The artifacts collected in the series of test excavations
fall into four broad categories:

ground stone, battered stone,

chipped stone, and residue from the manufacture of chipped
stone artifacts.

Within several of these categories are finer

groups which will be elaborated upon in the text of the descriptions.
Manufacturing waste and chipped stone are the predominant
kinds of artifacts made from locally available "flints".

Source

for the hard, often lustrous, gray to gray-black flints is
the upland exposures in the weathered, cretaceous, Edwards
limestone.
Materials collected from the initial survey have been included with that found during the test excavations.

Some specimens in these groups are not completed forms,

hence they cannot be considered as tools.

However, the stemmed

production broken, projectile point can be recognized for its
intended form.

4~Q)

The specimens identified as Marshall have been divided
into four groups based on what I feel represents three stages
of manufacture, two of the groups are thought to represent
completed forms.

Marshall Group 1

(1 specimen, Fig. 7 L)

The overall outline is subtriangular, with rounded corners
and convex lateral edges.

It is included as an early manufactur-

ing stage of the Marshall type because of the similarities of
the incipient stem in comparison to the finished stems of the
more complete specimens.

This specimen exhibits bifacial flak-

Most of the flakes are large, longer than wide and fairly

deep.

A lateral edge of one face exhibits some edge trimming,

possibly a prelude to additional thinning.

In addition, one

face exhibits thinning flakes removed from the base, precedent
to attempts at notching (not illustrated).

The resultant flake

Provenience:

These specimens represent a manufacturing stage in which
the stem has been completed and the blade had been thinned prior
to final marginal trimming.

Flake removal of this type
There is little or no edge

trimming present.
The completed stems are roughly square in outline having
parallel to slightly expanding edges, and straight to slightly
convex bases.

The stems appear to have been formed by pressure

flake removal with an instrument having a small, possibly pointed bit.
Provenience:

41 WM 57--2; 41 WM 88--5; 41 WM 115--1.

remainder of the blade suggests that a broad face with strongly
convex lateral edges existed previous to its present form.

The

nature of the flake scars posterior to the bit and anterior to
the stem are reminiscent of those on the faces of the Marshall
Two specimens.

No striations were present on the bit that

might suggest use in a rotary or pushing motion1 however, the
extreme distal tip did exhibit limited areas of edge dulling.
Provenience:

41 WM 57.

Marshall Group 4

(8 specimens, Fig. 7 P,Q)

These specimens (most fragmentary) are thought to represent a final, or near final, stage in manufacture.

They re-

present the usual final form in contrast to the Marshall Three
specimen (perforator).

72

The blades of these specimens differ from the stage
represented by Marshall 2

specimens in that the lateral edges

have been bifacially trimmed, obliterating the proximal end
of the long flake scars of the thinning flakes.

The interiors

of the faces retain portions of the larger flake scars.

The

resulting lateral edge is usually slightly convex.

The complete specimen lacks the usual abrupt beveling of the
stem, but some beveling is apparent.

It does appear to have

been made in the manner recognized for Nolan points (Sorrow
1969:28).

The stem was formed subsequent to completion of the

blade (unlike the manufacturing technique of Marshall points)

73

by simply removing flakes from one face of each side.

The

plane of the stem faces is slightly offset from the plane of
the blade faces.

This might be a factor in the absence of the

abrupt beveling of the stem edges.
Provenience:

Basal concavities vary from an inverted V-shape,

to deep inverted u-shapes, and occasional concavities.
seven points are represented by stems only, but the distinctive nature of the stem and base make their inclusion as
Pedernales fairly unifacially chipped; however, its stem, is
bifacially worked.

Whether this specimen is complete, as the

small size suggests, or not is conjectural.
Provenience:

41 WM 57--14 (3 stems, 3 burned); 41 WM 73--5
(2 stems, 1 burned); 41 WM 88--8 (1 stem);

Provenience:
Group 2

41 WM 57; 41 WM 88; 41 WM 115.

These specimens resemble the type Bulverde.

The stems

are rectangular and were manufactured in a similar manner as
Bulverde.

They also share the distinctive wedge-shape::l. stem

when viewed in transverse cross section.

However, the basal

corners are rounded and the blades are relatively narrow, resulting in very small shoulders.'
Provenience:
Group 3

41 WM 57 (burned); 41 WM 115.
(2 specimens, Fig. 7 X)

These specimens resemble the type, Fairland, except that
the minimum stem width is relatively less than on Fairland.
In addition, the basal thinning of one is less refined.

These

differences could easily be the result of idiosyncracies of
the craftsman, but due to their having sufficiently different
physical characteristics, they are listed separately.
Provenience:
Group 4

41 WM 56; 41 WM 88 (burned).
(2 specimens, Fig. 7 Y)

The specimens appear to have been broken during manufacture.
The remaining lateral edges suggest that the blade had long,
markedly convex margins.

The flake scars visible on the blade

of one specimen are long, narrow, and flat

Stemmed Bifaces II
In addition to the previously described specimens, there
are four stemmed bifaces that are not easily recognized as projectile points or perforators (the one perforator was included
in the previous section because it conformed to an established
type).

In three instances listed below, it is probable that a

manufacturing stage of some projectile point is represented,
but for various reasons the intended end result was not achieved.
Since they cannot be recognized as attempts to manufacture recognized forms, they are listed here rather than with the projectile points.
Specimen 1

(Fig. 8 K)

This biface is asymmetrical in outline.

The general out-

line is lanceolate with a single, notched proximal corner.

The

apparent attempt at stemming may be fortuitous as there are a
number of hinge fractures opposite the notch indicating the
possibility that the notch, or stem, was formed by attempts to
thin one face.

Complete Specimens
This group is divided into several categories based on
characteristics of flake removal.

The contention is that most

of these specimens represent stages of manufacture.

The basis

for this will be discussed for each group.
Biface 1

(1 specimen, Fig. 8 0)

This specimen is leaf-shaped with the proximal end more
rounded than the distal end.

Although no stem is present, it

is likely that the specimen was hafted in use.

The margins

exhibit considerable alteration, obliterating the proximal ends
of the flake scars present on the interior surface of each face.
No dulling along the lateral edges was detected.

This specimen

is made of a mottled gray-brown chert, unlike the material ut:i:lized for most of the artifacts from the area.

It is probable

that this specimen does represent a completed form.
This specimen was collected during the initial reconnaissance
of the reservoir area (Shafer and Corbin, 1965:18, Fig. 7 F).
It was identified as a representative of the type, Lerma, and
it does conform closely to the type description (Suhm and Jelks

1962:207).

Since it is unique to the collections of the imme-

diate area and due to the circumstances of its discovery (surface}, no type designation is used here.

Biface 2

(1 specimen, Fig. 8 P)

This large, ovate specimen was made on a large primary
flake and retains the nodular cortex along one edge of the
exterior face.

The interior face exhibits several flake scars

near the pointed end (proximal end of the flake) indicating
an apparent attempt to reduce the thickness of the bulb of
percussion.

The exterior surface has been worked along one

lateral edge and along the proximal end (distal end of the
flake).

The large flake scars apparently were intended to re-

move the cortex as well as provide a sharp edge.

The proximal

ends of these flake scars have been obliterated by marginal
trimming.
Like Biface 1 this specimen is unique to the collection
under consideration here.

This group of specimens is characterized by specimens exhibiting sufficient characteristics suggesting they were rejected during the manufacturing process.

formed by re-

peated hinge fracturing on at least one surface {Fig. 9 E,F).
Two specimens exhibit hinge fracturing along at least one margin

Althought the knots of flint, characteristic of

the previous six, are not present, the result is much the same

The largest group of unstemmed bifaces included primarily

These specimens are generally large and have irregular faces
and margins.

Their presence is probably attributable to dis-

card before completion of some specific tool type, probably
stemmed bifaces.

Fragmentary Specimens
This class of artifacts constitutes a considerable portion
of the chipped stone artifacts.

89

The fragments are grouped into

three gross categories: proximal, distal and medial.

A fourth

group of fragments is discussed separately as "Other Biface
Fragments".

Two of the three groups are further separated in-

to smaller groups based on the presence of characteristic flake
scars.
The classification of flake scars involves the presence
or absence of marginal trimming obliterating the proximal ends
of the scars produced during the thinning process.

All of those

which exhibit flake scars without any modification of the proximal end are considered to be earlier stages of the manufacturing
process, even though, in some cases, a specimen does exhibit
limited marginal trimming.
Distal Fragments 1 _ (18 specimens)
These specimens exhibit marginal retouching along the
edges of each face.

Most are pointed, but one has a rounded

tip and parallel edges indicating possible use as a perforator.
The general size (including thickness) is consistent with the
distal portions of many of the stemmed biface artifact class.
The presence of these specimens is probably attributable to
use breakage or to breakage during a near final stage of manufacture.

All have straight or slightly convex lateral edges.

Provenience:

Uni faces
Included in this category are all of the artifacts exhibiting uniface flaking.

Occasionally some specimens have

limited bifacial flaking.

The inclusion of these bifacially

chipped specimens is a subjective evaluation based on the assumption that the flaking on the second face is either fortuitous or functions in some way toward resharpening or flattening
of one face.
These specimens are divided into two groups, Uniface Artifacts I and II, based on the angle formed by the chipped edge

96

in relation to the interior or ventral surface of the flake.

Uniface Artifacts I
These specimens exhibit a unifacially chipped edge forming
greater than a 45 degree angle with the ventral surface of the

End Scrapers 2

(8 specimens)

The specimens are roughly circular in outline.

Like the

former group they exhibit a steeply flaked bit opposite the
striking platform.

Three are interior flakes, two are secon-

dary cortex flakes, and three are initial cortex flakes.

The

flaking is generally confined to the margins opposite the striking platform, although one specimen has had the striking platform removed (the bulb of percussion remains).

The angle form-

ed by the bit and the ventral surface is approximately 80 degrees
on four, approximately 50 degrees on three, and approaches 90
degrees on one.

Side Scrapers 2
These specimens are ovoid flakes.

They differ from other

side scrapers in that the chipped edge is relatively crude and
less definite than on the previously described group.
Provenience:

41 WM 57--37 41 WM 88--1.

Large Flake Scrapers

(6 specimens)

The specimens are large heavy flakes, usually with convex
cutting edges (one is concave and one is irregular).

are interior flakes, two are secondary cortex flakes, and one
is an initial cortex flake.
Provenience:

41 WM 57--2: 41 WM 88--2: 41 WM 115--2.

Notched Scrapers

(12 specimens)

The specimens are irregular flakes of varying sizes exhibiting shallow, unifacially chipped notches.

Other than

the beveled notches there is no particular feature that characterizes this group.

With the exception of one secondary cor-

tex flake, all are interior flakes.
Provenience:

41 WM 56--2: 41 WM 57--3: 41 WM 88--5: 41 WM 115--2.

Small Scrapers

Ground Stone ·

The predominant artifacts within this group are handstones
and grinding slab fragments

(1 complete).

Other artifacts in-

clude a fragment of a gorget and two tabular stone objects with
grooved faces.
Hand stones
Limestone

(2 specimens)

Of these two hand-sized limestone cobbles, one has a
slightly convex grinding surface.

The second has a convex

grinding surface and a possible flat surface on the opposite
face.

The flat surface is difficult to recognize as it is

heavily encrusted with calcium precipitate.

The convex surfaces

suggest use in a back-and-forth motion or in a limited rocking
motion.

Miscellaneous Objects

(3 specimens, Fig. 10 G-I)

Three limestone concretions, all fragmentary, were collected.

Most are angular and have no consistent form or character-

istics other than their amorphous shape.

These are simply lumped

together in a general group, labeled below as Cores 4.

A small

number of cores exhibit sufficient:ly-distinct features to warrant finer descriptive characterization.
Core 1

(1 specimen)

This small core appears to have been the source of small
flake blades.

The striking platform was prepared by removing

flakes perpendicular to the intended axis for flake removal.
Provenience:
Cores 2

(2 specimens)

These specimens are large, heavy cores, similar to the
previously described specimen.

Striking platforms were con-

structed by removal of flakes perpendicular to intended axis
of flake removal.

Chopper ?
I hesitate to identify anything as a chopper, which usually
refers to a crude, biface often pointed, or at least with a
rounded bit.

This specimen qualifies for rather minimal, defi-

nition, but there is little indication of wear, such as battel"ing, and it could easily have served as a core.

It differs

from the core groups described above in that it exhibits limited
marginal_retouch.

Since this retouch is unifacial in character,

it is possible that it served as platform preparation.
Provenience:

41 WM 88.

Utilized Flakes
seven hundred and eight utilized flakes were examined from
six sites.

They were grouped into seven categories: flake blades,

elongated flakes, flakes with cortex striking platform, with

111

single faceted striking platforms, with multi-faceted striking
platforms, with lopped striking platforms, and those flakes with
crushed or missing platforms.

With the exceptions of the flake

blades and the elongated flakes, most of the utilized flakes
were irregular in outline.

The altered edges of the categories

described on the basis of the striking platform vary from
straight to convex or concave.

The altered edges of the blades

and the elongated flakes are usually relatively straight, but
do vary from slightly convex to slightly concave.
The categories were established on the basis of the most
distinguishing attribute of each flake.

It is possible for

some flakes to have two or three of the attributes used in
esta:fulishing the groups.

For example, among the "blades" there

are secondary and initial flakes as well as several kinds of
striking platforms present.

In this instance, it is proposed

that the attributes of being a blade supersede the other characteristics.

In the case of the platform defined groups and

the groups defined on the basis of flake removal there are no
other characteristics that are sufficiently distinctive to
warrant consideration.
