Management Summary:
In March 2017, the Northside Independent School District (NISD) (Client) contracted Raba Kistner
Environmental, Inc. (RKEI) to perform an intensive cultural resources survey within a 9.65-acre tract of
land along Cinema Ridge, located immediately south of Oliver Wendell Holmes High School in San Antonio,
Bexar County, Texas. The purpose of this survey was to determine if cultural resources were located within
the Area of Potential Effect (APE), and if feasible, assess their significance and eligibility for inclusion in
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for formal designation as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL). As the area of potential effects (APE) is located on land owned by a political subdivision of the State,
the project falls under the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), as administered by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC). The field work was conducted March 23 and 24, 2017 under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) Permit No. 7960, issued to Antonio E. Padilla, who served as Principal Investigator. Mark
Luzmoor served as the Project Archaeologist and Chris Murray assisted during the field work.
Background research revealed that no previously conducted cultural resources surveys or previously
recorded archaeological sites are located within the boundary of the APE. Surface visibility was around 20
percent throughout the APE. Approximately 50 percent of the APE contained fill brought in from recent
construction activities near the APE, while the other 50 percent was covered by thick underbrush. During
the pedestrian survey, it was noted that approximately 10 percent of the terrain contained a slope greater
than 20 percent. Due to the presence of fill and the greater than 20 percent slope, only 4.35 acres of the
9.65-acres were able to be adequately surveyed. As a result, 10 shovel tests (STs 1–10) were excavated
within the APE.
During the excavation of the shovel tests within the APE, it was revealed that impacts to the APE from fill
dumping activities impacted a larger area than originally perceived. Of the 10 shovel tests excavated seven
(STs 1–3, 5, and 7–9) showed evidence of disturbance from filling activities. Additionally one shovel test
(ST 7), contained a piece of aluminum a pop top from a can, intermixed with the fill. Only three shovel
tests (STs 4, 5, and 10) contained intact soils; however they were negative for cultural material.
No cultural materials were encountered within the STs or observed on the surface during the
investigations of the APE. Based on the current investigations and due to the lack of cultural materials and
cultural features within the APE, RKEI recommends no further archaeological work within the current
project boundaries. All field records generated by this project will be curated in accordance with the Texas
Archaeology Research Laboratory requirements and the TAC permit.

Introduction and Area of Potential Effects
Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc. (RKEI) was contracted by the Northside Independent School District
(NISD) (CLIENT) to perform an intensive cultural resources survey within a 9.65-acre (ac) tract near Cinema
Ridge for the construction of new school facilities just south of Oliver Wendell Holmes High School in westcentral San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas (Figure 1-1). The property is currently owned by NISD a political
subdivision of the State. As such the project falls under the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) as
administered by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The purpose of the survey was to locate any
surface-exposed or buried cultural materials and assess their significance and eligibility for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for formal designation as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL). All work was performed in compliance with the ACT under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit No.
7960.
This report summarizes the results of the field investigations, and provides recommendations regarding
the proposed project. Following this introductory presentation and the description of the APE, Chapters
2 and 3 provide background on the setting of the project area, as well as the culture history and previous
archaeological investigations that have taken place in the vicinity of the APE. Chapter 4 outlines the field
and laboratory methods employed during the project and the Chapter 5 summarizes the results of the
field investigations. Chapter 6 provides a brief summary of the findings and provides recommendations
regarding the planned project.

Area of Potential Effect
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is located in west-central San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, just south
of Oliver Wendell Holmes High School and immediately west of the Regal Cinemas Cielo Vista 18 movie at
the end of Cinema Ridge. The APE is approximately 9.65 ac in size and is depicted on the San Antonio
West, Texas (2998-244) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map (Figure 12). The property directly south consists of undeveloped land, and the plot directly east consists of a
residential neighborhood. Huebner Creek runs approximately 0.85 km to the east of the APE.

The APE consists primarily of thick underbrush, a large fill pile, and steep (<20 percent slopes) terrain
(Figure 1-3). According to a historic aerial photograph from 1986 (Figures 1-4), several loads of fill were
dumped within the APE from nearby construction projects. This continued until roughly 2002 when the
movie theater and other businesses were constructed near the APE (Figure 1-5). These continued
dumping events altered the elevation of the central portion of the APE by approximately 50 percent. Due
to large amounts of rain over the years, a 10 foot wide chasm has developed within the construction fill
area, exposing a 10 to 15 foot stratified profile of fill deposited over the years (see Figure 1-3 and Figure
1-6). Due to the artificial landscape created by the fill (4.5 ac) and the greater than 20 percent sloped
terrain (0.8 ac) only 4.35 ac of the APE was able to be adequately surveyed (see Figure 1-3). The remaining
4.35 ac the APE contained heavy shrubbery and thick undergrowth (Figure 1-7).

Environmental Setting
Project Area Setting
The project area is located in the south-central Texas geographic region within the Blackland Prairie ecoregion. The Blackland Prairie is an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage, prone to frequent
flooding (Collins 1995). The Blackland Prairie physiographic region is characterized by gently undulating
topography and is generally defined as grasslands punctuated by riparian bands along creeks, rivers, and
other drainages. Creation of the Blackland Prairies occurred during the late Tertiary, with the erosions of
soils on the Edwards Plateau. These soils were deposited by eolian and colluvial processes across an
existing, eroded parent material of the Gulf Costal Plain, creating a mix of deep Tertiary and Quaternary
calcareous clay soils (Black 1989a).

Soils
Review of the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) datasets depict two soil types within the
APE, Heiden-Ferris complex (HoD3) and Austin silty clay (AuB) (Figure 2-1). Heiden-Ferris complex soils
cover 8.2 ac of the project area and are composed of two distinct soil series Heiden and Ferris series.
Heiden series soils are nearly level to steep soils that are typically encountered alongside slopes of ridges
on dissected plains, base of slopes, footslopes, and shoulders of interfluves. These soils are characterized
as deep to very deep, well-drained soils that were derived from weathered mudstone and reach a depth
of 178 centimeters (cm). Ferris series soils are well drained, deep, gently sloping to steep soils formed in
calcareous clayey mudstone residuum and reach a depth up to 203 cm. These soils are typically
encountered on back and side slopes or ridges within dissected plains (NRCS 2017).
Along the southcentral edge of the project area, approximately 1.45 ac is composed of Austin silty clay.
Austin series soils are characterized well drained, moderately deep soils that are found on nearly level to
sloping erosional uplands. These soils are derived from weathered chalk residuum and reach depths up
to 144 cm.

Flora and Fauna
The project area is located near the juncture of the Balconian and Taumaulipan biotic provinces (Blair
1950). Because the project is situated at the ecotone of two biotic provinces it Floral and faunal resources
consist of a mix of the two provinces. Trees, plants and grasses in this region include cedar (Juniperus
ashei), live oak (Quercus fusiformis), Texas mountain laurel (Sophora secundiflora), mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa), prickly pear (Optunia sp.), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), cat claw (Smilax bona-nox), mustang
grape (Vitis mustangensis), sotol (Dasylirion texanum), and Spanish dagger (Yucca sp.).
The fauna that inhabit the south-central Texas region includes at least 95 bird and 29 mammal species.
The area also contains a wide array of reptiles, fish and amphibians. Mammal species that were noted
within the APE include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virgininana), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus audubonii), feral hog, domestic and
feral cat, and squirrel.

South Texas Climate
The climate in south-central Texas is humid subtropical with hot and humid summers. From May through
September, hot weather dominates with the cool season beginning around the first of November and
extending through March. Winters are typically short and mild with little precipitation. San Antonio
averages only 33 inches (in) of rain per year (Southern Regional Climate Center 2017; based on monthly
averages from 1980 to 2010). Monthly temperature averages range between 52°F in January to 85°F in
August.

Culture Chronology and Previous Archaeology
Culture Chronology
The cultural history of South Central Texas spans approximately 11,500 years. Archaeologists have divided
the occupation of the region into four principal periods and several sub-periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The periods are characterized by changes in climatic conditions, distinct
vegetation types and structures, and concomitant adaptive changes by human populations in hunting and
gathering technologies and strategies, general material culture, and at the tail end of the cultural
sequence, the arrival of non-indigenous populations. The standard summaries of the culture chronologies
of Central Texas accepted by many of the regional archaeologists were produced by Collins (1995) and
Prewitt (1981). Below is a brief summary of the cultural sequence that has been reconstructed by
archaeologists for the south-central part of the state.
Paleoindian
The oldest cultural materials found in the region date to the Paleoindian Period. The period spans roughly
from 11,500–8800 BP (Collins 1995, 2004). The Aubrey site in Denton County has one of the earliest
occupations, with radiocarbon assays dating to between 11,542 ± 11 BP and 11,590 ± 93 BP (Bousman et
al. 2004:48). Paleoclimatic proxy measures suggest that a cooler climate with increased precipitation was
predominant during the Late Pleistocene (Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al 1993), the later portion
of the period.
Initial reconstructions of Paleoindian adaptations typically viewed these hunter-gatherers as traversing
extreme distances in pursuit of now extinct mega-fauna such as mammoth and mastodon. While these
Paleoindians populations did exploit the Late Pleistocene mega-fauna when it was accessible, a number
of faunal assemblages from an increasingly larger number of sites indicate that the Paleoindian diet was
more varied and consisted of a wide range of resources, including small game and plants. The Lewisville
(Winkler 1982) and the Aubrey sites (Ferring 2001) produced faunal assemblages that represented a wide
range of taxa, including large, medium, and small species. Information on the consumption of plant
resources during the Paleoindian period is lacking. Bousman et al. (2004) reported that the late
Paleoindian component at the Wilson-Leonard site reflected the exploitation of riparian, forest, and
grassland species. Analysis of Paleoindian skeletal remains indicates that the diets of the Paleoindian and
later Archaic hunter-gatherers may have been similar (Bousman et al. 2004; Powell and Steele 1994).
The early portion of the Paleoindian Period was characterized by the appearance of Clovis and Folsom
fluted projectile points that were used for hunting mega-fauna. Typical projectile points produced at sites
with occupations dating to the later portion of the Paleoindian period included the Plainview, Dalton,
Angostura, Golandrina, Meserve, and Scottsbluff types. Meltzer and Bever (1995) have identified 406
Clovis sites in Texas. One of the earliest, 41RB1, yielded radiocarbon assays that put the maximum age for
the Paleoindian component at 11,415 ± 125 BP (Bousman et al. 2004:47).
Sites in Bexar County that contain Paleoindian components include St. Mary’s Hall (Hester 1978, 1990),
Pavo Real (Collins et al. 2003), the Richard Beene site (Thoms et al. 1996; Thoms and Mandel 2006) and

12

41BX1396 (Tomka 2012). St. Mary’s Hall, 41BX229, was first encountered in 1972 during the construction
of a house just outside the school’s property. The Pavo Real site, 41BX52, is located along Leon Creek in
northwest Bexar County. The site first was documented in 1970 and has been investigated several times
over the past 40 years (Collins et al. 2003). The Richard Beene site, 41BX831, is located along the Medina
River in southern Bexar County (Thoms et al. 1996). Site 41BX1396 is located in Brackenridge Park in San
Antonio, Texas, and was encountered during installations for lighting in 2010. Dating of organic samples
indicated that occupation at the site occurred as early as 10,490–10,230 BP.
Archaic Period
The Archaic Period dates between ca. 8800 to 1200 BP. It is divided into three subperiods: Early, Middle,
and Late. During the Archaic, mobility strategies may have shifted to more frequent short-distance
movements that allowed the exploitation of seasonal resource patches. The intermittent presence of
bison in parts of Texas, combined with changes is climatic conditions and the primary productivity of the
plant resources may have contributed to shifts in subsistence strategies and associated technological
repertoire. When bison was not present in the region, hunting strategies focused on medium to small
game along with continued foraging for plant resources. When bison was available, hunter-gatherers
targeted the larger-bodied prey on a regular basis.
Early Archaic
Collins (1995) suggests that the Early Archaic spans from 8800 to 6000 BP. Projectile point styles
characteristic of the Early Archaic include Angostura, Early Split Stem, Martindale, and Uvalde (Collins
1995). The Early Archaic climate was drier than the Paleoindian period and witnessed a return to
grasslands (Bousman 1998). Mega-fauna of the Paleoindian period could not survive the new climate and
ecosystems, therefore eventually dying out. Early Archaic exploitation of medium to small fauna
intensified.
The Wilson-Leonard excavation produced a wealth of cultural materials representative of a lengthy period
in regional prehistory. The projectile point assemblages from the site indicate that the lanceolate
Paleoindian point forms continue from the Paleoindian into the Early Archaic (Angostura). However,
relatively quickly during the Early Archaic, they are replaced by corner- and basally-notched and
shouldered forms (Early Triangular, Andice, Bell) that quickly become the dominant points tipping the
atlatl-thrown darts. In addition, the uses of small to medium hearths similar to the previous period were
noted. The appearance of earth ovens suggests another shift in subsistence strategies. The earth ovens
encountered at the Wilson-Leonard site were used to cook wild hyacinth along with aquatic and terrestrial
resources (Collins et al. 1998). Analyses of Early Archaic human remains encountered in Kerr County
(Bement 1991) reveal diets low in carbohydrates in comparison to the Early Archaic populations found in
the Lower Pecos region. Within Bexar County, the excavations at 41BX1396 revealed an Early Archaic
component, radiocarbon dated to Cal BP 8390 to 8180 (Tomka 2012).
Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic subperiod spans from 6000 to 4000 BP (Collins 1995; Weir 1976). Archaeological data
indicates that there appeared to be a population increase during this time. Climate was gradually drying

13

leading to the onset of a long drought period. Changes to the demographics and cultural characteristics
were likely in response to the warmer and more arid conditions. Projectile point styles characteristic of
this subperiod include Bell, Andice, Calf Creek, Taylor, Nolan, and Travis.
Subsistence during the Middle Archaic saw an increased reliance on nuts and other products of riverine
environments (Black 1989b). The increase of burned rock middens during the Middle Archaic represented
the increased focus on the use of plant resources (Black 1989b; Johnson and Goode 1994). Little is known
about burial practices during the Middle Archaic. An excavation in an Uvalde County sinkhole (41UV4)
contained 25–50 individuals (Johnson and Goode 1994:28).
Late Archaic
The Late Archaic spans from 4000 to 1200 BP (Collins 2004). It is represented by the Bulverde, Pedernales,
Kinney, Lange, Marshall, Williams, Marcos, Montell, Castroville, Ensor, Frio, Fairland, and Darl projectile
points. The early part of the Late Archaic exhibited fluctuations in the temperature and rainfall. There
appears to have been an increase in population at this time (Nickels et al. 1998).
Some researchers believe that the use of burned rock middens decreased during the Late Archaic. Some
research has challenged this notion (Black and Creel 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994)
discuss the role of burned rock middens in relation to acorn processing.
Human remains from burials related to the Late Archaic in Central and South Texas suggest the region saw
an increase in population. This increase may have prompted the establishment of territorial boundaries,
which resulted in boundary disputes (Story 1985). Human remains dating to this sub-period have been
encountered near the Edward’s Plateau.
Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric Period begins ca. 1200 BP (Collins 1995; Collins 2004), and appears to continue until
the beginning of the Protohistoric Period (ca. A.D. 1700). The term Late Prehistoric is used in Central and
South Texas to designate the time following the end of the Archaic period. A series of traits characterizes
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric Period. The main technological changes were the shift to
the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery. The Late Prehistoric Period is divided into two phases:
the Austin Phase and the Toyah Phase.
At the beginning of this period, environmental conditions were deemed to be warm and dry. Moister
conditions appear after 1000 BP (Mauldin and Nickels 2001). Subsistence practices appeared similar to
the Late Archaic. Projectile points associated with the Austin Phase include the Scallorn and Edwards
types. The Toyah Phase is characterized by the prominence of the Perdiz point (Collins 1995).
Most researchers concur that the early portion of the Late Prehistoric period saw a decrease in population
density (Black 1989b:32). Radiocarbon dates from some sites have indicated that the middens were
utilized during the Late Prehistoric. Some archaeologists feel the peak of midden use was after A.D. 1 and
into the Late Prehistoric (Black and Creel 1997:273). Radiocarbon dates from Camp Bowie middens

14

provide evidence that supports Black and Creel’s arguments that burned rock middens were a primarily
Late Prehistoric occurrence (Mauldin et al. 2003).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 BP, a shift in technology occurred. This shift is characterized by
the introduction of blade technology, the first ceramics in Central Texas (bone-tempered plainwares), the
appearance of Perdiz arrow points, and alternately beveled bifaces (Black 1989b:32; Huebner 1991:346).
Prewitt (1981) suggests this technology originated in north-central Texas. Patterson (1988), however,
notes that the Perdiz point was first seen in southeast Texas by about 1350 BP, and was introduced to
west Texas some 600 to 700 years later.
Early ceramics in Central Texas (ca. A.D. 1250 to 1300) are associated with the Toyah Phase of the Late
Prehistoric and are referred to as Leon Plain ware. The Leon Plain ceramic types are undecorated, bonetempered bowls, jars, and ollas with oxidized, burnished and floated exterior surfaces (Ricklis 1995). There
is notable variation within the type (Black 1986; Johnson 1994; Kalter et al. 2005). This variation can be
attributed to differences in manufacturing techniques and cultural affiliation. Analysis of residues on
ceramic sherds suggests that vessels were used to process bison bone grease/fat, mesquite bean/bison
bone grease, and deer/bison bone grease (Quigg et al. 1993).
The return of bison to South and Central Texas during the Late Prehistoric resulted from a drier climate in
the plains located to the north of Texas and increased grasses in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah
in north-central Texas (Huebner 1991). The increased grasses in the two biotas formed the “bison
corridor” along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau and into the South Texas Plain (Huebner
1991:354–355). Rockshelter sites, such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and
Classen Rock Shelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967), have indicated a shift in settlement
strategies (Skinner 1981). Burials dating to this period often reveal evidence on conflict (Black 1989b:32).

History of the APE
The west-central portion of Bexar County was largely uninhabited until the mid-1800s. Maps, including
Upshur and Lindsey’s 1837 map of Bexar County, indicate that the project area was once a portion of a
larger parcel consisting of a league and labor granted to Elizabeth Plunkett and is documented in the
Elizabeth Plunkett Survey No. 72 Abstract 573 (Figure 3-1). Historical documents do not indicate when
Plunkett arrived in San Antonio; however, she started making land claims in the area by 1840, if not earlier,
based on the 1937 Upshur and Lindsey map. The project area is first mentioned when Plunkett paid her
yearly taxes in 1840 to the Bexar County Sheriff, William Elliot (Bexar County Deed Records [BCDR] F2:
387–388). Eventually Ms. Plunkett transferred the property to John Plunkett in 1854 (BCDR L2: 485).
Mr. Plunkett then sold the property in 1877 to H. B. Adams and E. D. L. Wickes (BCDR 5: 264) who then
divided the property evenly into a northwestern and a southeastern portion. The northwester portion
was sold to William F. Walker in 1877 while the southern portion was retained by H.B. Adams and E. D. L.
Wickes (BCDR 7: 304).

(Texas General Land Office 2017).

16

The southeastern portion of the Elizabeth Plunkett Survey No. 72 where the APE is located, was eventually
acquired by F. Smith and Company in 1897 (Figure 3-2). Eventually in 1902, F. Smith and Company sold
the 1,168 acres to H. Wehmeyer Sr. From 1902 to 1998 the property has been divided, sold, and held in a
trust.
Review of historical aerial photographs reveal that the area has not been developed and no possible
historic-age buildings or structures were identified. In the 1938 aerial photograph, tree cover of the
property is patchy with some open space tree, indicating that the area may have been maintained.
Gradually overtime vegetation began to engulf the entire APE. However sometime prior to 1986
development of the area impacted a majority of the APE. A large area had been cleared out and used as
a dumping or staging ground for the surrounding construction projects.

Previous Archaeology
Background research revealed that no previously conducted cultural resources surveys or previously
recorded archaeological sites are located within the boundary of the APE. Examination of a 1-kilometer
(km) radius of the APE, revealed that five archaeological surveys have been conducted (THC 2017) (Figure
3-3). Surveys were conducted in advance of infrastructure improvement projects composed of road and
water related projects. Two linear surveys were conducted in 1977 by TxDOT along what would become
Loop-410. No other information is available concerning these surveys (THC 2017). In 2009, SWCA
Environmental Consultants conducted a constraints analysis of Phase I of the Bexar County Flood Control
Capital Improvement Program which was composed of 18 separate projects throughout Bexar County.
One of these projects (LC-8) lies within a 1 km buffer of the current project area. This project included the
construction of a 597 meter (m) long, 19.5 m wide span bridge along Ingram Road to an elevation above
the 100-year floodplain of Leon Creek. As a result of this project, no new archaeological sites were
encountered (Miller et al. 2011). As a part of the Bexar County Capital Improvement Program, Raba Kistner
Consultants investigated project area LC-17 which was located just north of LC-8. The survey consisted of
approximately 2.64 miles (165 total ac) of a proposed flood control project along Huebner Creek from
Ingram Street to just past Bandera Rd. As a result of this project, two new sites were encountered:
41BX1879 and 41BX1880. Site 41BX1879 is a sparse campsite, with cultural material composed of firecracked rock and debitage which possesses little if any research potential. Site 41BX1880 consists of a
heavily-looted, burned rock midden which partially extends into LC-17. Cultural materials included three
lithic tools and debitage. Due to the highly disturbed nature of both sites, the authors did not recommend
any additional work at either site (Clark & Murray 2011).
In 2011, Hicks & Company conducted an intensive linear survey for Phase II of the City of San Antonio’s
Leon Creek Greenway Development Project, from Ingram Road to Loop-410. This hike and bike trail
extended 2-km from Ingram to Loop 410. No archaeological sites were recorded as a result of this project
(Champion 2011).

The review of the projects and newly recorded sites within the vicinity of the APE indicates that most
archaeological components are found east of the Edwards Plateau and are most likely Late Prehistoric
assemblages. These components likely represent the remains of hunter-gatherer groups visiting the
Blackland Prairie on hunting expeditions targeting either medium or large ungulates such as deer and
antelope or bison. While such visits would also have occurred during preceding times, it appears that the
remnants of such Early and Middle Archaic activities have been scoured from the landscape except
perhaps in the vicinity of major streams that cross-cut the Blackland Prairie.

Methods of Investigation
RKEI utilized a combination of visual surface inspection and shovel test excavations to assess surface and
shallowly buried archaeological deposits. Shovel testing was conducted in areas judged to have high
probabilities for cultural deposits and/or when surface visibility was below 30 percent. In addition, shovel
tests were excavated to aid in archaeological site boundary delineation. All work complied with THC and
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) survey standards for Texas for the overall project area.

Field Methods
The archaeological survey consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the entire project APE. Since
approximately half of the APE was either fill material or greater than a 20 percent slope, only 10 shovel
tests (STs) were excavated. All shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and, unless prevented
by obstacles or buried features, extended to a depth of 60 centimeters below surface (cmbs). Each shovel
test was excavated in 10-cm intervals. All soil from each level was screened through ¼ inch hardware
cloth. Any collected artifacts were to be labeled with appropriate provenience information for laboratory
processing and analysis. A shovel test form was completed for each excavated shovel test. Data collected
from the shovel test included the final excavation depth, a tally of all materials encountered from each
10-cm level, and a brief soil description (texture, consistency, Munsell color, inclusions). The location was
recorded using a Garmin, hand-held, GPS unit. Shovel test locations were sketched onto a current aerial
photograph of the APE as a backup to the GPS information. Any additional observation considered
pertinent was included as comments on the standard shovel test excavation form.

Laboratory Methods
All project related documentation produced during the survey was prepared in accordance with federal
regulation 36 CFR Part 79, and THC requirements for State Held-in-Trust collections. Field notes, field
forms, photographs, and field drawings were placed into labeled archival folders and converted into
electronic files. Digital photographs were printed on acid-free paper, labeled with archivally appropriate
materials, and were placed in archival-quality plastic sleeves when needed. All field forms were completed
with pencil. Ink-jet produced maps and illustrations were placed in archival quality plastic page protectors
to prevent against accidental smearing due to moisture. A copy of the report and all digital materials were
saved onto a CD and stored with field notes and documents. As all artifacts were recovered from private
property, they will be returned to the property owner at the completion of the project. No cultural
materials were collected during the course of the survey.

Results of Investigations
In March of 2017, RKEI performed a pedestrian survey of the proposed location of new school facilities
on Northside Independent School District owned lands in west-central San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas.
The APE encompassed approximately 9.65-ac; however due to the presence of 10–15 feet thick
construction fill dumped across 4.5 ac of the APE and the 0.8 ac containing greater than 20 percent slope,
only 4.35 ac were able to be adequately surveyed. The survey consisted of a visual inspection of the
ground surface for cultural materials and the excavation of 10 shovel tests (STs) throughout the APE
(Figure 5-1). The pedestrian survey was conducted utilizing 15 transects placed 30 m apart. Of the 10
shovel tests excavated, two were located within the filled area for confirmation of soils while the
remaining eight were excavated in the remaining 4.35 ac (see Figure 5-1).
The majority of the APE is situated on a generally level upland formation with a gentle slope to the
southwest. Along the center of the project area, trending northeast/southwest, the topography drastically
changes due to the artificial landscape created by the fill dumping events that have occurred over the
years. Along the southeastern portion of the APE, the formation slopes (20 percent slope) southeasterly
to a generally level upland landscape.
Vegetation is composed of trees with thick underbrush occupying a majority of the area. Areas not
covered in thick brush, were areas where dirt two-track and cleared roads cross the APE, along the
southern boundary, the southeast corner, and along the northern boundary. Due to the thick vegetation
across the APE ground surface visibility varied between 5 and 10 percent. Due to the lack of ground surface
visibility, shovel tests were excavated in these areas.
Disturbances observed impacting the APE were composed of both natural and artificial impacts. Natural
disturbances consisted of erosion due to weathering. Artificial disturbances include the artificial landscape
created by the continuous dumping of fill and the creation of the two-track and cleared roads. During the
survey, piles of modern trash were scattered along both sides of the road, at the southeastern corner of
the APE (see Figure 5-1). Trash observed included a pile of roofing shingles (Figure 5-2), cut logs, machine
cut and treated lumber, window glass, and other piles of modern trash (Figure 5-3). The material noted
in the trash dump dated to the late-twentieth and early twenty first century, and therefore was not
labeled as a feature.

Shovel Tests
Since approximately half of the APE was either fill material or greater than a 20 percent slope, 10 shovel
tests were excavated during the course of the project (Figure 5-1). Two STs (STs 2 and 3) were excavated
within the area of fill to confirm the existence of disturbed soils (Figure 5-4). The remaining eight shovel
tests (ST 1 and STs 4–10) were excavated within areas of the APE that did visibly contain fill material or a
slope greater than 20 percent. Nine of the ten shovel tests were negative for cultural material. One Shovel
Test (ST 7) produced a piece of aluminum foil and a pop top from a can.
During the excavation of the shovel tests throughout the areas of the APE, revealed that impacts to the
APE from fill dumping activities impacted a larger area than originally percieved. The two shovel tests
excavated directly on top of the area heavily impacted by the fill activities were excavated to depths
between 20 and 40 cmbs and were terminated due to compact caliche. Soils encountered within these
two shovel tests consisted of a light gray (10YR 8/2) intermixed with crushed gravels. These same soils
were encountered within five shovel tests (STs 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9) in the upper 10 to 40 cmbs and in the case
of ST 9, to depth. In STs 5 and 8 these disturbed soils were underlain by a 10 cm thick brownish black
(10YR 3/2) silty clay at a depth between 20 and 30 cmbs and were underlain again by compact disturbed
soils. In ST 7 disturbed soils were encountered in the upper 40 cm (Figure 5-5) and included a piece of
aluminum and a pop top from a can. These disturbed soils were underlain by intact soils composed of a
brownish black (10YR 3/2) silty clay to a depth of 60 cmbs.
The remaining three shovel tests (STs 4, 6, and 10) were the only ones excavated that contained intact
soils. Of the three shovel tests two (STs 6 and 10) were excavated to depth, while one (ST 4) was
terminated due to compact soils. A typical shovel test profile exhibited a brownish black (10YR 6/3) silty
clay with some pebbles. No cultural materials were encountered within these shovel test.

Summary and Recommendations
The archaeological survey of the 9.65-ac tract of land for the proposed NISD high school was conducted
over two days in March 2017. The property consisted of approximately 4.5-ac of brought in fill and 0.8acres of landform that exceeded 20 percent slope. Therefore, shovel tests excavated within the remaining
4.35-ac which were covered by thick underbrush. Disturbances observed impacting the APE were the
artificial landscape created by the continuous dumping of fill and the creation of the two-track and cleared
roads. Other disturbances observed consisted of modern trash dumped along the road at the
southeastern corner of the APE, consisting of discarded roofing shingles, clear flat glass, appliances, tires,
and other materials.
Due to the decreased size of the project area that was both undisturbed and below a 20 percent grade,
only 10 shovel tests were excavated within the APE. The goal of these shovel tests was to determine if
there were any cultural materials within the APE. During the excavation of the shovel tests, it was revealed
that impacts to the APE from fill dumping activities impacted a larger area than originally perceived. Of
the 10 shovel tests excavated seven (STs 1–3, 5, and 7–9) showed evidence of disturbance from filling
activities that reached depths between 10 and 60 cmbs. Additionally one shovel test (ST 7), contained a
piece of aluminum a pop top from a can, intermixed with the fill at a depth of 36 cmbs. Only three shovel
tests (STs 4, 5, and 10) contained intact soils; however they were negative for cultural material.
Based on the investigations, a majority of the APE has been impacted due to dumping activities that have
occurred during past construction activities in the area. No diagnostic prehistoric or historic materials
were encountered within the project boundaries. With the lack of intact temporally diagnostic cultural
material from pedestrian survey and subsurface testing, RKEI does not recommend any further
archaeological investigations within the APE surveyed. However, should changes be made to the project
APE, further work may be required.
