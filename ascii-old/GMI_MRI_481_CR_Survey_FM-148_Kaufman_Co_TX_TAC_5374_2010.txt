ABSTRACT

Under contract with Bucher, Willis & Ratliff, and the Dallas District of the Texas Department of
Transportation, Geo-Marine, Inc., performed an archeological assessment of a 7.1-mile segment
of FM 148 northeast of Crandall in Kaufman County (CSJ 0751-01-033, -034, -035, -041, -042,
and -043) that is scheduled to be widened. Fieldwork consisted of a windshield reconnaissance
survey of the existing 40-foot-wide state-owned right-of-way along this portion of FM 148 and
intensive pedestrian survey with selective shovel testing of areas within the right-of-way
determined during the reconnaissance survey to have potential for cultural remains. One historic
archeological site (41KF138) was recorded on the southeast side of FM 148. The site consists of
an extant historic structure (ca. 1910) located outside of the right-of-way. Shovel tests excavated
within the right-of-way in the front yard of this property yielded minimal artifactual materials that
were not collected. All notes, forms, and photographs obtained during this project will be
permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

The Dallas District of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing to widen a
segment of Farm-to-Market road (FM) 148 (CSJ 0751-01-033, -034, -035, -041, -042, and -043)
11.4 kilometers (km; 7.1 mile [mi]) in length north and east of the city of Crandall in Kaufman
County (Figure 1). In preparation for this project, the planning and engineering firm Bucher,
Willis & Ratliff contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), to conduct cultural resources
investigations of the right-of-way (ROW; GMI Project No. 30417.00.02) in order to comply with
the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915]. On
August 21, 2009, GMI archeologist Arlo McKee and GMI field technician Lindsey Skelton
performed windshield reconnaissance and intensive pedestrian archeological surveys along the
existing state-owned right-of-way (ROW) and drainage easements. Jessica M. Forbes served as
architectural historian, and Melissa M. Green served as Principal Investigator for the project.
The project area begins at the intersection of FM 148 and FM 987 near the community of Talty,
Texas, and extends along FM 148 to its intersection with US Highway (US) 175. The proposed
road widening would occur entirely within ROW that extends approximately 12 meters (m; 40
feet [ft]) on each side of the road centerline (24 m [80 ft] in width). Currently, FM 148 is a twolane road with occasional 0.9-m-wide (3-ft) shoulders, and the proposed project would widen the
road to include a 13-m (44-ft) roadway with two 4-m (12-ft) travel lanes and two 3-m (10-ft)
shoulders. The depth of impact from this construction is anticipated to be 0.9–1.5 m (3 to 5 ft),
although the maximum depth at creek crossings would extend to bedrock.
Five bridges will be replaced with longer and wider bridges as a part of this project:
(1) The bridge at Buffalo Creek (CSJ 0751-01-034) will be replaced with a 46-ft-wide by 85ft-long bridge. New abutments will be constructed approximately 7 ft behind/ahead of the
existing abutments.
(2) At Draw Creek (CSJ 0751-01-041) the bridge will be replaced with a 46-ft-wide by 80-ftlong bridge. The new abutments will be constructed approximately 14 ft behind/ahead of
the existing abutments, and the horizontal alignment will be shifted to accommodate the
proposed alignment of the new bridge.

(3) The existing bridge at Big Brushy Creek Relief #2 (CSJ 0751-01-043) will be replaced with
a 46–ft-wide by 150-ft-long bridge. The new abutments will be placed approximately 4 ft
behind/ahead of the existing abutments, and the horizontal alignment of the roadway will
be shifted by 7.5 ft.
(4) At Big Brushy Creek (CSJ 075-01-035), the bridge will be replaced by a 46–ft-wide by
185-ft-long bridge. The new abutments will be constructed 5 ft behind/ahead of existing
abutments, and the roadway will be shifted 7.5 ft to accommodate the new alignment.
(5) Finally, the bridge at Big Brushy Creek Relief # 1 (CSJ 075-01-042) will be widened to
accommodate the proposed road width.
The entire area of potential effects (APE) for this project is within the existing state-owned
ROW and no additional properties will be included.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
The project area is in western Kaufman County in the Blackland Prairie physiographic zone.
Low rolling plains covered with black, calcareous clay soils dissected by numerous streams
characterize the Blackland Prairie. These soils support predominantly grasses, primarily little
bluestem and Indiangrass; shrubs and trees are present along stream bottoms and in flood plains
(Diamond et al. 1987).
The Trinity River constitutes the southwest border of Kaufman County, and the East Fork of the
Trinity River merges with the main Trinity River channel roughly 15 miles south of Crandall and
the project area (Bureau of Economic Geology 1987). Buffalo Creek and Big Brushy Creek are
the two sizeable streams crossing the project area. Buffalo Creek, the larger of the two streams to
cross FM 148 near Crandall within the project area, is a third-order stream (following Strahler
1952). Shortly downstream, Buffalo Creek becomes a fourth-order stream as it merges with one
of its larger unnamed tributaries, which also crosses the current APE. Buffalo Creek then flows
southwest—toward the East Fork Trinity River south of Crandall where it has been
channelized—and flows parallel with the East Fork Trinity River as a yazoo stream for several
miles. Located east of the community of Talty near the eastern edge of the project area is Big
Brushy Creek. At its crossing with FM 148, Big Brushy creek is a fourth-order stream.
Additionally, two sizeable relief channels of Big Brushy Creek cross FM 148 on both the east and
west sides of the main channel of Big Brushy Creek. Big Brushy then flows southeastward and
drains into Kings Creek rather than immediately draining into the Trinity River.
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The underlying geology of the entire project area consists primarily of the Neylandville and
Marlbrook Marl formations (Bureau of Economic Geology 1987). These marl formations are
Upper Cretaceous in age and consist of medium gray, silty, sandy, and calcareous clay that
weathers to light gray.

5

The soils in the project area are mapped as the Houston Black-Heiden association, which is
common on broad, nearly level uplands (Pringle 1977). More specifically, there are six soil series
that occur within the project area and these have been subdivided into 11 phases or consociations.
The most abundant soil series is the Houston Black, which covers about 63 percent of the current
study area. This soil series is classified as a fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts. Houston
Black soils are very deep, moderately well drained, and very slowly permeable and are typically
associated with upland residual soils formed in Upper Cretaceous calcareous clay and marl
formations. Within the survey area, the Houston Black occurs in two map units: Houston Black
clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; and Houston Black clay 0 to 1 percent slopes (Pringle 1977).
The Heiden and Ferris series cover a combined total of 18 percent of the current study area.
These two soil series are both well-drained and slowly to very slowly permeable, found in upland
settings, and they both formed in residuum from Upper Cretaceous marine formations. The
distinguishing characteristics between the two is that the Heiden series is found in erosional
contexts whereas the Ferris series is not, and Ferris soils tend to be lighter in color (chromic).
The Heiden series is classified as fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts, and the Ferris series is
classified as fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Udic Haplusterts. Within the survey area, these soil
series occur in three phases and one consociation: Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes; Heiden
clay, 5 to 8 percent slopes; Ferris clay, 5 to 12 percent slopes, eroded; and Ferris-Heiden
complex, 2 to 5 percent slopes (Pringle 1977).
The Trinity series is found in about 10 percent of the project area. The Trinity series is classified
as very-fine, smectitic, thermic Typic Hapluderts. Trinity series soils are characteristically very
deep, moderately well drained, and very slowly permeable, typically associated with lowland
alluvial settings, especially in flood plains within the region. The Trinity series occurs in two
phases in the project area: Trinity clay, frequently flooded; and Trinity clay, occasionally flooded
(Pringle 1977).
A small portion of the study area near Talty contains soils of the Wilson series, which composes
about 7 percent of the project area. This series is classified as fine, smectitic, thermic, Oxyaquic
Vertic Haplustalfs. These are very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils
that are typically associated with stream terrace or terrace remnants on uplands in the region. The
Wilson series occurs in two phases in the project area: Wilson silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes;
and Wilson silt loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (Pringle 1977).
Finally, a very small portion of the study area (<1 percent) is mapped as the Kaufman series.
This series is classified as very-fine, smectitic, thermic Typic Hapluderts. The Kaufman series
consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that form on flood
plains within clayey alluvium. The Kaufman series occurs in only one phase in the project area,
Kaufman clay, occasionally flooded (Pringle 1977).
CLIMATE
The humid subtropical climate of Kaufman County is characterized by hot summers and fairly
evenly distributed rainfall. The range in temperature between winter and summer is largely
influenced by air masses from the Gulf of Mexico in the spring, summer, and fall months and
Arctic air currents in the winter months. The annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures
are 77 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and 53°F, respectively. Winter temperatures are mild, and cold
6

periods usually last only a few days. Although annual precipitation averages around 99
centimeters (cm; 39 inches [in]), it fluctuates year to year and has been as little as 58 cm (23 in)
and as great as 147 cm (58 in). During the spring and summer months, rainfall tends to occur
from high-intensity thunderstorms that produce rapid runoff, but during the winter months, slow,
general rains are more common. Annual snowfall is light and averages less than 8 cm (3 in)
(Orton 1977:52).
FLORA AND FAUNA
Kaufman County is located in the Texan biotic province defined by Blair (1950) as an
intermediate zone between the eastern forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and
the western grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Yates and Ferring
(1986:22) explain that the Texan province is not so much a distinct geographic unit as it is a giant
ecotone, in which species from both the forests to the east and the grasslands to the west overlap
at the limits of their ranges. The region as a whole is characterized by high species diversity
(Yates and Ferring 1986:22). The Blackland Prairie portion of the Texan biotic province consists
of one of several tall-grass prairies prevalent in this portion of Texas. Overstory, where it occurs,
consists of open stands of live oak (Quercus fusiformus), with occasional intermixtures of
southern red oak (Quercus falcata), willow oak (Quercus phellos), and white oak (Quercus alba).
Minor overstory species include black willow (Salix nigra), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), red
ash (Alphitonia excels), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia),
American elm (Ulmus americanus), bois d’arc (Maclura pomifera), and mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa). Riparian environments often support stands of pecan (Carya illinoinensis), plum
(Prunus americana), hackberry (Celtis reticula), black walnut (Juglans nigra), and similar trees,
many of which would have been important food resources in prehistoric times.
Understory consists mostly of perennial “bunch” grasses such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium
scoparium), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa saccharoides), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis),
sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), and Indiangrass
(Sorghastrum avenaceum), among others. Other common plant species in the region include
several varieties of brier (Rubus sp.), rock cress (Arabis petiolaris), few-seed sedge (Carex
oligocarpa), marigold dogweed (Dyssodia tagetoides), Texas bluegrass (Poa arachnifera), and
butterweed (Senecio glabellus). Also present are the fragmented remains of the tall-grass prairie
that once dominated this region.
A wide variety of faunal species occurs in the area. Blair (1950) cites a total of 57 mammalian
species for the Texan biotic province. Also noted by Blair are 16 species of lizard, one species of
land turtle (Terrapene ornata), 36 species of snakes, and 22 species of amphibians. Blair makes
no mention of birds, although some 320 avian species are known to exist in the region. Common
bird species include mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus),
and turkey vulture (Cathartes aura).
Riparian environments are important habitats for such species as the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger),
opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris). Grasslands and
similar open habitats support white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cotton rat (Sigmodon
grammacus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus),
red fox (Canis rufus), and gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Aquatic environments provide
habitat for raccoons (Procyon lotor) and the occasional mink (Mustela vison) and muskrat
7

(Ondatra zibethicus), as well as many species of fish, including catfish (Ictalurus and Pylodictus
spp.), sunfish (Lepomis spp.), and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens); various water snakes
and amphibians; migrating waterfowl; and shorebirds. Enterprising species that have colonized
human habitats include the black rat (Rattus rattus), house mouse (Mus musculus), and house
sparrow (Passer domesticus). Local species that are now considered threatened or endangered
include the mountain lion (Felis concolor), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), prairie falcon (Falco
mexicanus), and merlin (Falco columbarius). Several species that may have historically
inhabited the area, such as pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) and bison (Bison bison),
are locally extinct, but predator species such as the coyote (Canis latrans) and the bobcat (Felis
rufus) are not uncommon (Blair 1950:113–115).
PROJECT AREA LAND USE AND VEGETATION
The entire project APE consists of existing ROW of FM 148. The roadway is primarily in a rural
setting. Pasture and cultivated agricultural fields constitute approximately 70 to 80 percent of the
surrounding area. However, residential properties are common particularly in the eastern onehalf of the project area near Talty as well as the intersection of FM 148 and Stitzle Road.
Vegetation within the APE and surrounding area is predominantly grass and forbs with
occasional juniper and immature mixed hardwood trees along fencerows. A mixture of pecan and
hackberry trees line the stream crossings within the APE, and understory vegetation in these areas
is typically heavy with brush, greenbrier, wildflowers, poison ivy, and other vines. Ornamental
flowers and shrubs sometimes occur in residential and commercial areas.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL BACKGROUND

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Previous archeological investigations in the Trinity River basin have focused on the upper basin.
On the East Fork of the Trinity River, several projects, including Lavon Lake (Dawson and
Sullivan 1973; Lynott 1975; Stephenson 1949) and Lake Ray Hubbard (Harris and Suhm 1963;
Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Ross 1966) have made significant contributions to the
understanding of cultural processes in the region. Significant archeological projects on the upper
Elm Fork of the Trinity in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Denton area include Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring
1987; Ferring and Yates 1997; Prikryl and Yates 1987; Skinner et al. 1982), Lewisville Lake
(Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring and Yates 1998; Stephenson 1950), and Grapevine Lake (Ferring
1975; Morgan 1975). Along the West Fork of the Trinity River and its tributaries, intensive
investigations have occurred only at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988).
In the middle Trinity River basin, Anderson County’s Cedar Creek Reservoir was initially
surveyed in 1961 by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP). This survey recorded 30
sites dating from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods, and an earlier Paleo-Indian presence
in the area was suggested by scattered surface finds of early style projectile points (Guy 1990:58).
TASP excavated three sites in 1964: Wild Bull (41HE61), Lacy (41HE70), and Gossett Bottoms
(41KF7; Story 1965). Material from Archaic through Late Prehistoric occupations was identified
at all three sites, and a Paleo-Indian component was also tentatively identified at Wild Bull.
Archeological investigations in the middle Trinity River basin, composed of Cummins,
Chambers, and Richland creeks, in the Blackland Prairie, however, vary in intensity and quality.
The extensive prehistoric, historic, and environmental investigations conducted by the Richland
Creek Archeological Project were carried out in connection with the construction of the RichlandChambers Reservoir on Richland and Chambers creeks in Freestone and Navarro counties, west
of Anderson County (Bruseth and Martin 1987; Bruseth and Moir 1987; Bruseth et al. 1987;
Jurney and Moir 1987; Moir and Jurney 1987). The reservoir area was intensively surveyed by
Southern Methodist University (SMU) in 1980, and 911 archeological sites were recorded. Of
these sites, 270 were subsequently tested, and 106 were judged eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Excavations were carried out at 15 prehistoric and 38
historic sites, and architectural studies were conducted at 38 structures, between 1982 and 1984
9

(Guy 1990:97). This work primarily identified Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric
utilization of the area, and three Late Prehistoric phases were defined for the Richland-Chambers
creek area (i.e., Richland Creek, Round Prairie, and St. Elmo). In addition, some Paleo-Indian
and Early Archaic occupations were indicated. The historic research focused on mid-nineteenthto mid-twentieth-century Anglo-American and African-American occupations, most of which
were small rural settlements or farmsteads.
Surveys were conducted prior to the construction of the proposed Superconducting Super Collider
and Bardwell Lake in Ellis County, Cedar Creek Reservoir in Kaufman and Henderson counties,
and Navarro Mills Reservoir in Navarro and Hill counties (see Guy 1990, Prikryl 1993, and
Yedlowski et al. 1998 for more detailed information on these and other regionally relevant
projects). Because of the location of Cedar Creek and Richland-Chambers reservoirs on the
southeastern margin of the Blackland Prairie, investigations there have revealed more about
Native American adaptations to the Oak Woodlands than to the Blackland Prairie.
PREHISTORIC CULTURAL CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
The culture history sequence of the middle Trinity River basin has been defined largely by a few
major reports that have primarily added to an understanding of the Late Prehistoric presence in
this area. Summarized in Table 1, the following sequence is based on Bruseth and Moir (1987),
Prikryl (1993), Story (1990), and Yedlowski et al. (1998). These large-scale surveys have
provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding of the adaptations in the
middle Trinity River basin. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archeologists have recorded numerous sites, much research remains to be done.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period in northcentral Texas (ca. 10,000–6500 B.C.) generally includes those
remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the immediate postPleistocene periods (for reviews relevant to this period in northcentral Texas, see Hofman 1989a;
Johnson 1989; Prikryl 1990; Story 1990). Point types often found that can be associated with the
early to late portions of the period include Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Plainview, San Patrice, and
Scottsbluff. Based on a sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl (1990) has
suggested that among the most common Paleo-Indian point types in this area are Plainview and
Dalton. Ferring and Yates (1997) suggest that these types date to about 9,500–10,000 years ago,
based on cross dating with other regions. The suggested age for these types may correspond with
the onset of early Holocene alluviation in the Trinity River valley. The majority of the recorded
Paleo-Indian sites cluster in the upper Trinity drainage where the most intensive archeological
investigations have taken place, though often these sites consist of no more than one or two
points. The Acton site, however, located in Hood County on a T-2 terrace of the Brazos River
overlooking Lake Granbury, is significant for the number of Plainview and Dalton (Meserve)
points it produced (n=72). A variety of other lithic tools such as gouges, scrapers, and burins also
were recovered. Unfortunately, the Paleo-Indian occupation could not be isolated from Archaic
period occupations of the site.
The generally low density of Paleo-Indian artifacts and sites and the tendency for projectile points
to be made from nonlocal lithics have led investigators to characterize these populations as highly
mobile with low, regional densities (Lynott 1981:100–101). The Paleo-Indian occupation of the
upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile points from surface
collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995).
The Field Ranch site (41CO10) along the upper Elm Fork is a prime example of typical site
contexts (Jensen 1968). Interestingly, the only two investigated sites in northcentral Texas with
apparently discrete Paleo-Indian components—the Lewisville and Aubrey sites located in the
upper Trinity River basin—are early, both producing Clovis projectile points. The Lewisville site
(41DN72) contained 27 hearth features with an associated Clovis point and other sparse lithic
materials (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958; Story 1990:182–184). Although the original
radiocarbon dates on the hearths suggested an anomalously early age for Clovis points (ca. 37,000
years before present [B.P.]), later work by the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1982) appears to
have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation there. Apparently, the
presence of naturally occurring lignite in these hearths, either as a fuel or as an inadvertent
inclusion, contaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted date of
12,000–10,000 years ago for Clovis period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the
first human occupation of northcentral Texas. The deeply buried Aubrey site (41DN479), located
on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River, yielded lithic debitage and Clovis points buried beneath 8 m
(26 ft) of Holocene alluvium on the Elm Fork flood plain (Ferring 1989, 2001). The discovery of
this site suggests that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in northcentral Texas will only be found
by examining deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in modern flood plain situations. The
Lewisville and Aubrey sites contained a variety of faunal remains, both large and small; the
largest—white-tailed deer—can be associated comfortably with the Clovis occupation at the
Lewisville site. The preponderance of small game at the Aubrey site could be interpreted as
representing a more generalized pattern of foraging than the reliance on mammoth and bison
apparently demonstrated at Clovis sites on the Southern Plains (Hofman 1989a:31–32). Such a
divergence in subsistence patterns may reflect an inherent adaptability of Clovis technology to
changing environmental conditions encountered as early populations spread southeastward into
Texas (Ferring and Yates 1997).
11

There are no excavated and reported Paleo-Indian components on the central Blackland Prairie
itself. Nonetheless, a variety of early points has been found, largely in surface contexts, and it is
clear that this part of Texas was used throughout the period from ca. 10,000 to 6500 B.C.
Presumably, this use was by hunter-gatherer groups with low population densities and high
residential mobility. An analysis of materials collected by C. K. Chandler and other avocational
archeologists from sites chiefly in Ellis County during the Superconducting Super Collider
project identified a handful of Paleo-Indian projectile points typed as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Golondrina, and San Patrice, along with several untyped lanceolate specimens (Yedlowski et al.
1998). Other early materials from the area include a few San Patrice points from the RichlandChambers Reservoir (Bruseth et al. 1987) and a cache of 23 prismatic blades from a site in
Navarro County (Young and Collins 1989).
Archaic Period
The Archaic period is tentatively dated between ca. 6500 B.C. and A.D. 700, having been
subdivided into early, middle, and late divisions (Prikryl 1993:199). Thus, the Early Archaic has
been dated from 6500 to 3000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 3000 to 1000 B.C., and the Late
Archaic from 1000 B.C. to A.D. 700. Overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas
include those from Hofman (1989a), Prikryl (1990), and Story (1985, 1990). Diagnostic artifacts
for the period are similar to those of adjacent regions, although developing a sound chronological
sequence of diagnostic artifacts has proven difficult because many of the investigations have
focused on surface manifestations. Prikryl (1990) suggests that Early Archaic projectile points
include early split-stemmed varieties and possibly Angostura, and Middle Archaic points include
basal-notched forms such as Bell, Andice, and Calf Creek along with Wells, Dawson, Carrollton,
and Bulverde. Late Archaic point types reportedly include Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood,
Ellis, Trinity, Palmillas, Yarbrough, Dallas, Godley, Elam, and Gary (Prikryl 1990). At one time,
the Carrollton and Elam foci were used to define the Middle and Late Archaic, respectively
(Crook and Harris 1952, 1954). Reevaluation of the type-site artifacts, however, showed that the
materials were so mixed that perpetuation of these foci provides little interpretive value (Hofman
et al. 1989; Prikryl 1990). Some of this mixing and the generally low numbers of Early and
Middle Archaic sites may be due to extensive erosion of mid-Holocene deposits, as has been
documented for the Brazos drainage in Young, Stephens, and Throckmorton counties (Ensor et al.
1992).
Though few isolable components have been analyzed for the various divisions of the Archaic
period in northcentral Texas, slowly increasing populations responding to warmer and drier
environmental conditions have been postulated to explain the overall archeological record of the
period (Lynott 1981; Story 1990). It is thought that these factors may have led Archaic
populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of northcentral Texas to develop a diversified
hunting and gathering pattern based on bottomland resources of the rivers and major creeks,
while populations on the Rolling Plains maintained a focus on bison hunting (Hofman 1989a).
Projectile points of the period were fashioned from local lithic materials, suggesting that
populations were less mobile than were their Paleo-Indian predecessors. Less mobility also may
suggest refinement of the diversified subsistence pattern to include scheduling of resource use
within more restricted areas. Evidence from Late Archaic sites at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and
McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997) in the upper Trinity River basin
indicates repeated site occupation by small groups, which could support the resource-scheduling
hypothesis. Still, even with refinement of resource utilization, evidence of dietary stress has been
12

found on Late Archaic human skeletal materials (Ferring and Yates 1997; Gill-King 1987).
Additional sites (41WS43 and 41WS44) in Wise County are thought to have been inhabited as
temporary Archaic camp occupations (Beene 1996).
Mixing of components also has hampered interpretations regarding the use of the middle
Richland-Chambers Creek area of the middle Trinity River by Native Americans during the
lengthy Archaic period. Because few pure Archaic components have been excavated, particularly
ones dating to the first two-thirds of the period, it is difficult to say much about artifact
chronologies, subsistence practices, or settlement strategies. A variety of projectile point styles
traditionally associated with the Early and Middle Archaic periods in Central Texas—for
example, Andice, Angostura, Bell, Gower, Hoxie, Martindale, Nolan, Travis, and Uvalde
(Yedlowski et al. 1998)—was identified during analyses for the Superconducting Super Collider
project (although a host of other types perhaps dating to this time and later were identified as
well, their chronologies are less certain), but these points are few in number and do not appear to
represent a major occupation of this part of the Blackland Prairie. Demonstrably early points
were scarce at the Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills Reservoir (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et al.
1966). Only Wells points and Clear Fork gouges were felt to be potentially diagnostic of the
Early Archaic period in the Richland-Chambers Reservoir area. Data pertaining to the Early to
Middle Archaic may be scarce in part because sites dating to this interval lie deeply buried or
were removed by extensive erosion during the mid-Holocene (Bruseth et al. 1987; Fields 1995).
A few radiocarbon assays predating 2000 B.C. were obtained, but points dated to this interval in
Central Texas (for example, Bell/Andice/Calf Creek and Hoxie) occur at the Richland-Chambers
Reservoir in only very small numbers.
The Middle Archaic period (3000–1000 B.C.), identified at seven sites within the reservoir
(Bruseth and Moir 1987:Figure 18-3) in the Richland-Chambers Reservoir area, is slightly more
visible. Dart point types diagnostic of this period include Bulverde, Carrollton, Yarbrough, and
possibly Dawson. Waco sinkers and Clear Fork tools were present as well. Small concentrations
of burned sandstone were identifiable in excavations at several sites and were interpreted as being
subsurface roasting pits of short duration. Based on excavated data, population density is felt to
have been low, with reduced group mobility in comparison to the earlier periods. Economically,
hunting and gathering is felt to have continued to be of primary importance, with utilized
resources including turtle, cottontail rabbit, bird, fish, deer, and hickory nuts. The presence of an
unidentified rhizome may also indicate the use of some species of prairie turnip (Psoralea sp.
[Bruseth and Moir 1987:234–236]).
A much different picture is presented for the Late Archaic period (after about 4,000 years ago),
which is known from numerous sites in the central Blackland Prairie. Both the Pecan Springs and
Strawn Creek sites yielded such Late Archaic point types as Gary, Dawson, and Yarbrough,
although they tended to be mixed with materials from later occupations (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et
al. 1966). The surface collections analyzed during the Superconducting Super Collider project
also contained these types, as well as a number of Late Archaic types common in Central
Texas—such as Darl, Ensor, Marcos, Marshall, and Montell—and a variety of probable Late
Archaic forms more characteristic of the northern and eastern parts of the state such as Carrollton,
Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, Kent, and Neches River (Yedlowski et al. 1998). Noting the relatively
high frequency of Late Archaic projectile points, Yedlowski et al. (1998) suggest that regional
use by hunter-gatherers increased as a result of moister climatic conditions than before,
presumably associated with greater productivity in subsistence resources. They also note that,
although the projectile point evidence indicates interaction with groups living in Central Texas
13

proper, larger proportions of points indicate affinities with eastern Texas than during the Early
and Middle Archaic.
Fifteen investigated archeological sites in the Richland-Chambers creek area could be placed
within the Late Archaic period (1000 B.C.–A.D. 700). Subsistence evidence recovered from
various sites included deer, turtle, hickory nuts, some form of Psoralea tuber, and a variety of
seeds, with sumpweed being most common (Bruseth and Moir 1987:236–240, Table 18-7). In
addition to constellations of projectile point styles (e.g., Dawson, Gary, Godley, Kent, Neches
River, and Yarbrough) that indicate ties more to the north and east than to the south and west,
each of these areas has yielded information suggesting that ceramics may have been introduced
into the material culture of local groups at this time. To the east, this interval is usually called the
Early Ceramic period, and sometimes the Woodland period (Brown 1987:44-22 through 44-26).
At Richland-Chambers Reservoir, distinctive shell-tempered sherds were recovered from contexts
dated between A.D. 200 and 700 at the Adams Ranch site (Bruseth et al. 1987:236–240),
apparently representing the earliest ceramic industry in this part of the Trinity River basin.
Along Richland and Chambers creeks, Late Archaic groups appear to have been hunter-gatherers
whose subsistence pursuits focused on wild plant foods such as hickory nuts and prairie turnip
and faunal taxa such as deer, turtles, small mammals, birds, and fish (Bruseth et al. 1987:236–
240). Although presumably not sedentary, these groups clearly used the area in an intensive
fashion for residential purposes, and it appears that populations increased while territory sizes
decreased. A conspicuous component of the record is the so-called “Wylie pits,” which are large
man-made depressions measuring approximately 16 m (52.5 ft) in diameter and 0.61 m (2 ft) in
depth, excavated at the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites. These large features appear to
have been used for communal processing of vegetal resources (and later as cemeteries), perhaps
in the context of band aggregation in “tension zones” as territories decreased in size (Bruseth et
al. 1987; Prikryl 1993). Wylie pits were in use at Richland-Chambers Reservoir in the Late
Archaic (Bruseth and Martin 1987), but radiocarbon assays from pits at the Upper Rockwall and
Sister Grove Creek sites in the Lake Lavon area of the upper Trinity basin suggest an association
with the Late Prehistoric period (Lynott 1975; Ross 1966).
Late Prehistoric Period
The initial appearance of arrow points marks the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period. These
arrow points, ceramics manufacture, and the introduction of cultigens such as corn are important
technological changes defining the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700–1650). Group
aggregation and large-scale manipulation of subsistence resources represented by habitation
structures, indicating increased sedentism, as well as the Wylie pits and the human burials they
contain may be indicative of societal changes that continued through the Late Prehistoric period.
In addition, there may be evidence (e.g., the distinction between burials placed inside and outside
of Wylie pits) of differential mortuary practices that could reflect a shift toward a hierarchical
social structure, although this evidence is nowhere near as strong as that for the Caddoan area of
northeast Texas. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric
period be divided into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of
the foraging subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting
Southern Plains influences. Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites
of this period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).

14

The Richland Creek phase, dated between A.D. 700 and 900, is the earliest manifestation of the
Late Prehistoric in the Richland-Chambers creek area. This phase is characterized by the
appearance of the bow and arrow; the predominant projectile point styles were Scallorn and
Steiner. Deposits datable to this phase are also associated with dart points, including two small
varieties of Gary points. The collections studied during the Superconducting Super Collider
project contain substantial numbers of both early (e.g., Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Colbert,
Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz) arrow points, but Yedlowski et al.
(1998) note that early arrow points are more frequent, perhaps reflecting continued high
population densities from the Late Archaic period. Other than the Perdiz and Scallorn types,
which have such widespread distributions, the arrow point styles point eastward and northward.
Ceramics increased in importance during this phase with the addition of plain, sandy paste ware
and bone-, grog-, and/or grit-tempered ware with punctated or incised decorations, possibly
related to Canton Incised. The limited ceramic samples, containing sherds reminiscent of types
such as Weches Fingernail Impressed, Killough Pinched, Maydelle Incised, and Poyner
Engraved, also support interaction with Caddoan groups to the east (Yedlowski et al. 1998). The
Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills Reservoir presents a similar picture; most of the typed arrow
points date to the first half of the Late Prehistoric period, and the more distinctive ceramics in the
small collection relate to the early Caddoan types—Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Weches
Fingernail Impressed (Duffield 1963). Both small and large roasting pits are present, but overall
diminished in size. Clusters of postholes suggest the presence of some type of structures. Faunal
remains indicate that fish, cottontail rabbit, deer, and turtle were exploited; occasionally, certain
sites demonstrate evidence for specialized exploitation. Plant remains include evidence of
Psoralea tubers, hickory nuts, acorns, pecans, and various other seeds (Bruseth and Moir
1987:240–243).
The period between A.D. 900 and 1300 in the Richland-Chambers creek area has been defined as
the Round Prairie phase. Artifact assemblages of this phase are characterized by the presence of
Alba points in association with the two late varieties of Gary points, as well as by increased
frequencies of ceramics, including punctated and incised types similar to Canton Incised. It has
been suggested that the Bird Point Island site (41FT201) was a sedentary occupation at this time.
The subsistence economy during this phase was very similar to that of the preceding Richland
Creek phase, with similar species being exploited. However, notable additions to the exploitative
pattern included bison and jackrabbit, suggesting the closer proximity of grasslands than in the
previous period (Bruseth and Moir 1987:243–245).
The final phase of the Late Prehistoric period in the Richland-Chambers area, the period from
1300 to 1650, has been designated the St. Elmo phase. This phase is characterized by Perdiz
and Cliffton arrow points, although a small percentage of Gary dart points is still present in
deposits dating to this period. Subsistence resources include bison, deer, cottontail rabbit,
jackrabbit, raccoon, and fish, as well as hickory nuts, pecans, acorns, Psoralea, and various seeds.
Small amounts of maize have been recovered from these sites, although it is not clear whether it
was being cultivated in the Trinity River basin or imported from East Texas. Ceramics are more
common in these deposits than ever before and are thus assumed to have been more important.
Tempering materials remain the same, but engraving and incising became the dominant
decorative techniques, with some design elements resembling those of the Caddoan type Poynor
Engraved. Despite these changes, it has been suggested that settlement patterns became
somewhat less sedentary in comparison with the previous phase. A wide-ranging and more
mobile economy has been proposed on the basis of structures being less permanent in appearance
and an increase in nonlocal lithic materials (Bruseth and Moir 1987:245–247).

Historic Native American Cultural Chronology
Prior to Spanish settlement of New Mexico in 1598, European presence in the Southwest and on
the Southern Plains was sporadic at best (Coronado in 1540–1541, the Rodriguez-Chamuscado
party in 1581, Espejo in 1582–1583). After 1598, however, Spanish influence was never absent
from the Southern Plains, although actual contact with Europeans continued to be limited and
only brief historical records of journeys into or through the area exist (Hofman et al. 1989; John
1975).
By the eighteenth century, immigrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond
northcentral Texas, and their documentation by traders and explorers marks the start of the
Historic period (A.D. 1650 to 1850; Prikryl 1993). Unfortunately, since good historical
documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River basin during the early Historic era, it is
not clear which specific aboriginal groups were residing in the present-day Dallas/Fort Worth
area at the beginning of this period. What is clear is that the early Historic period in northcentral
Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993).
Documentary sources suggest that the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai, Yojaune,
Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo traversed the region at various times during the period
(Campbell 1983; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982). Prior to about 1725–1750,
Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains, known as
the High Plains. After that time, the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche and
Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the Middle
Plains and northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman
1989b:91).
Available data suggest that many, if not all, of the aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of
the Great Plains, including northcentral Texas, were Caddoan language speakers, from the
Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this light, it is worth noting that it
has also been suggested that the Socoatino, encountered by the survivors of the de Soto
expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and were the same as the Canohatino,
identified by the French in the latter part of the seventeenth century, apparently located at that
time “on the Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of presentday San Antonio, Austin, and Waco” (Newcomb 1993:24). If the prehistoric occupants of the
eastern margin of the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they
were absorbed very early by other Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai,
Tawakoni, Taovaya, Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in northcentral Texas in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form
the historic Wichita Tribe. Some, however, were probably absorbed by the united Caddo Tribes,
and some may even have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa,
during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The term Wichita is commonly used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including
the Wichita, Taovaya, Tawakoni, Iscani, Waco, and Kichai. Many of these groups apparently
entered the Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern
Nebraska, to escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita
were true Plains Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and
bison hunting. They occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which
they conducted seminomadic bison hunts. In 1719, their villages were located along the Arkansas
16

River in northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of their
villages to southern Oklahoma along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end of the
Sabine and Neches rivers in Texas and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper Brazos
rivers. In 1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with the Spanish, one of their villages
was on the Salt Fork of the Brazos, on the Middle Plains west of present-day Dallas/Fort Worth
(John 1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll 1952:2:705). Wichita groups were included in treaties
made with the Republic of Texas in 1843 and with the United States in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and
Carroll 1952:2:709). In Texas, they continued to live between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers
until 1855. In that year, the Tawakoni and Waco were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation,
south of Fort Belknap, in company with a number of other Native American remnant groups
(Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:212, 2:905). Subsequently, as a result of increasing
animosity from white settlers, they were removed to Indian Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb
and Carroll 1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita moved to Kansas during the Civil War,
but returned to Oklahoma after the war to settle permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman
1989b:95).
Although archeological sites that can be associated definitely with various Historic groups are
few, sites attributable to the Historic Wichita, who moved into Texas from Oklahoma and Kansas
in the early 1700s, have been identified at the edges of northcentral Texas. Among these is the
Stansbury site, now inundated by Lake Whitney, in Hill County (Stephenson 1970). Excavations
at the site produced burials, house structures, storage pits, and a variety of aboriginal artifacts
along with European ceramics, glass beads, metal arrow points, and flintlock musket parts. A
cluster of Wichita sites also occurs to the north along the Red River in Montague County. These
sites are known collectively as “Spanish Fort” and occur on both the Oklahoma and Texas sides
of the river. Woodall (1967) excavated one of these sites, named the Upper Tucker site. The site
produced artifacts and features similar to those discovered at the Stansbury site. Wichita sites on
both the Brazos and Red rivers were located atop high terraces overlooking the rivers. Within the
upper Trinity River basin, little evidence of these Historic Native American groups has been
found, with the exception of a few Native American sites with European items (Sollberger 1953).
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern
Plains became commonplace. This was the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the
Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north, and the acquisition of Louisiana by the
United States in 1803.
EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Texas in general has a rich and complex history that extends back almost as far as the presence of
Europeans in North America. Texas, and the northcentral region in particular, was not settled by
Anglo-Americans, however, until the early 1800s. The following discussion is intended to be
only a general overview of this history; for more detail regarding Historic Native Americans and
the early European/Euro-American history of Texas, the reader is referred to Campbell (1983), de
la Teja (1988), Fehrenbach (1985), Gilmore (1991), Hester (1989), John (1975), Pool (1975),
Wedel (1978), and Winship (1990). This section is divided into subsections that cover various
time periods: Spanish exploration (1519–1718), French and Spanish colonial activities (1718–
1821), Mexican statehood (1821–1836), the Texas Republic (1836–1846), American statehood
(1846–1865), post-Civil War (1865–1900), and the twentieth century (post-1900).

17

Early Spanish Exploration: 1519–1718
The initial European presence in Texas began in 1519 when Spanish explorer Alonso Alvarez de
Piñeda arrived on the Texas coast while exploring the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Webb
1952:1:380). Attempts to explore and colonize continued, and in 1528, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca and his shipwrecked party landed on an island known to the Spanish as Malhado, possibly
Galveston Island (Webb 1952:2:261–262; Winship 1990:1–4). Although Spanish exploration of
the region continued with over 90 expeditions into Texas from 1519 to 1731, it was evident by
1550 that there were no golden cities or wealthy countries to conquer north of Mexico.
Consequently, Spanish expansion into the American southwest and Texas slowed, leaving eastern
Texas largely unexplored.
Around 1542, the survivors of the Hernando de Soto expedition, led by his lieutenant Luís de
Moscoso de Alvarado, entered northeast Texas as they attempted to reach New Spain by land
(Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991). During his four-year exploration of the present-day southeast
United States, de Soto reached the Mississippi River in May 1541 and spent the rest of that year
exploring present-day northern Louisiana and Arkansas. De Soto died in 1542, leaving Moscoso
de Alvarado to guide the expedition overland to Mexico and safety. Moscoso de Alvarado’s
exact route is unknown, but archeological studies indicate that he apparently traversed the Red
River valley somewhere between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas. The
party crossed the Red River and journeyed through northcentral Texas to present-day Wichita
Falls before returning to the Mississippi River to travel to the Gulf of Mexico. Because of the de
Soto expedition, Spain claimed the Red River valley as part of its colonial empire (Commercial
National Bank of Shreveport, Louisiana 1979:8, 34; Cooper et al. 2003; Kelley and Coxe
1996:20).
During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in southern Texas, tension between
Coahuiltecan groups and the Spanish and between Coahuiltecan groups and the Apache escalated.
This ultimately led to Spanish protection of the Coahuiltecan groups against the Apache, and the
establishment of the first Spanish missions in 1670 (John 1975:172–174). Spanish fear of an
increased French presence in Texas led to the decision to establish missions and presidios in East
Texas as a buffer against further French encroachment into that region (Cooper et al. 2003; Pool
1975:28; Webb 1952:2:483–484). The easternmost Spanish mission was Mission San Francisco
de los Tejas, northwest of the present community of Weches near the Neches River (Works
Progress Administration [WPA] 1940:37).
Spanish and French Colonial Activities in Northcentral Texas: 1718–1821
Because present-day northcentral Texas was located on the border of the French and Spanish
colonial spheres of influence, much of the early settlement during the eighteenth century in the
counties near the project area were trading posts that were tasked with establishing relations with
the Native Americans to gain allies. The three-pronged approach that the Spanish used for
settlement—presidio, mission, and civilian colony—proved to be more successful in south Texas,
and they had only established two missions on the middle Trinity River by 1756 (Sherman
2001:E-1).

18

Outside political factors during the latter half of the eighteenth century had a great impact on the
development of the region. The French Revolution, and the European monarchies’ efforts to stop
it, resulted in a decline from the French threat. As a result, mission status was downgraded, and
the Spanish missions were secularized by 1793. Following the sale of Louisiana to the United
States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into northcentral Texas intensified, although for a
number of years it was not clear who actually owned the area south of the Red River. The United
States considered it (and, indeed, most of Texas) to be part of Louisiana and encouraged
settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939). Spain, on the other hand (and later Mexico),
was violently opposed to this view, and at several times during the first few decades of the
nineteenth century, the dispute nearly led to war (Smith 1991). The first official American
penetration of the region was by the Freeman-Curtis Expedition of 1806, which was turned back
at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a Spanish military force (Cooper et al. 2003; Flores
1984). By 1810, Spanish rule in northcentral Texas had rapidly deteriorated. The question of
territorial ownership was finally settled by the Adams-Onis Treaty (1819), which ceded Florida to
the United States for assuming Spanish debts to American citizens. The treaty also defined
borders in the west, and the Red River was designated as the border between the two nations
(Cooper et al. 2003; Tindall and Shi 1996:406).
Despite Spain’s claim, northcentral Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the
Anglo-American sphere of influence, and settlement from the United States continued. Some of
the early settlement mirrored French Colonial practices, such as the establishment of trading
places like the pole hut built by a settler known only as “Blue” in the Rattan area of Delta County
in 1820 (McCroskey 1997). The earliest permanent settlements were confined to the areas
immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the prairies along
river tributaries and early roads such as Trammel’s Trace and Dayton’s Road. Trammel’s Trace,
a popular immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur River at Epperson’s Ferry
and continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs, founded in 1839, and then
south to cross Cypress Creek 2 miles west of Jefferson (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:793–794).
Mexican Statehood: 1821–1836
Following Mexico’s independence from Spain in 1821 (May 1991), political, economic, and
social conditions in Texas slowly improved. Beginning in 1823, immigration laws were changed
to allow empresarios to offer lands to heads of families willing to settle in Texas. The policy had
been initially investigated by the Spanish as a means of securing the territory and providing a
buffer zone against Indian attack. In fact, Moses Austin had applied for and received permission
to bring 300 American colonists to Texas in 1821, prior to Mexican independence (Fehrenbach
1985:135). By the time he returned to his home in Missouri, his health had deteriorated, but
before his death, he convinced his son, Stephen, to carry out his plans (Fehrenbach 1985:136).
Stephen F. Austin followed in his father’s footsteps. Because of the liberal land policies of first
Spain and then later Mexico, he had many eager volunteers ready to accompany him. Colonists
had to be of good moral character and were required to become Spanish (then Mexican) citizens.
They were also required to convert to Catholicism, although this requirement was not rigorously
enforced (Fehrenbach 1985:140; Tindall and Shi 1996:578–579). The government charged a flat
title fee, and Austin received a fee. The law required the land to be developed within two years
or forfeited. In all, 297 titles were issued and only seven forfeited. Most of the settlers claimed
to be ranchers for obvious reasons because of the larger land allotments.
19

The original Anglo-American settlers in northcentral Texas were apparently largely subsistence
farmers residing on small holdings, with an economy reportedly based on grain and livestock
production (Peter and Cliff 1990:36). The commercial production of cotton apparently was not
introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach 1985), a shift that was accompanied by increasing
numbers of slaves in the region. By 1830, 1,000 African-American slaves had been brought to
the eastern coastal region to serve as labor in the cotton fields (Tindall and Shi 1996:579). The
introduction of cotton affected the development of urban areas of northcentral Texas also. The
town of Jefferson, founded in 1836 along Cypress Creek, was a major cotton market, and the
antebellum planters throughout the region undoubtedly sent their cotton there for sale where it
could be shipped to the market of New Orleans down the river (Peter and Cliff 1990:39). Other
major industries established to support the growing agriculture about the same time included tan
yards, lumber yards, and syrup mills (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198, 2:59; WPA 1940:379).
One of the effects of increased immigration was the opening and improvement of roadways,
many of which followed the Spanish caminos (paths, tracks). The influx of settlers into the
region brought changes in local politics as well, and Anglo-American immigrants gained more
power. Most of the early settlements in northcentral Texas occurred during the 1830s. In many
areas of Texas, Mexicans were becoming politically overshadowed by the new immigrants. The
Mexican government, alarmed by this situation, passed the Decree of April 6, 1830, which
prohibited the further “colonization of Mexican territory by citizens of adjacent countries—
meaning the United States” (Fehrenbach 1985:165) and the importation of slaves, which was
designed to discourage large-scale farming. This decree further alienated the Anglo-American
settlers. From 1832 to 1835, a series of conflicts and temporary solutions continued to drive a
wedge between Colonial Texas and Mexico. When meetings were held in San Felipe, the AngloAmerican immigrants adopted resolutions and framed a state convention resulting in the
formation of a state separate from Coahuila. In 1835, a Mexican army crossed the Rio Grande
bound for San Antonio to squelch the rebellious Texans. A call to arms was issued and hostilities
were begun in earnest (Fehrenbach 1985:193).
Many of the conflicts, known as the Texas Revolution, were fought in and around the city of San
Antonio. These engagements culminated in the battle at the Alamo (formerly Mission San
Antonio de Valero) in the spring of 1836. During the siege of the Alamo, elected representatives
from the colonies met at Washington-on-the-Brazos, where on March 2, 1836, the Texas
Declaration of Independence was signed. After Santa Anna’s victory at the Alamo, his forces
were defeated by the Texans at the Battle of San Jacinto. Because of its distance from the
Mexican border and the lack of large settlements, no major battles of the Texas Revolution
occurred in northcentral Texas (Tindall and Shi 1996:579–581).
Republic of Texas: 1836–1846
In 1836, the Republic of Texas government was loosely organized, there were no schools
(Fehrenbach 1985:247), and most of the 40,000 residents were subsistence farmers. When the
first elections were held in the new republic, an overwhelming majority voted to approve a union
with the United States. The issue of slavery, which was heavily debated in the halls of power in
the United States, however, stood in the way of this annexation for 10 years (Zinn 1995:153).
The old Spanish/Mexican conventions, though, were quickly replaced with the more familiar
Anglo-American customs, and the policy of disbursing land during the years of the Republic of
Texas was governed by the Constitution of the Republic of Texas.
20

Each settler was responsible for locating the land (often unavailable in the county in which he
resided), providing witnesses to attest to his arrival date, and paying for survey and filing fees. In
most counties, the Board of Land Commissioners worked without delay because of the extreme
importance of land to the citizens. Land was also distributed in differing amounts for military
service. “Thus, it was virtually impossible, theoretically, for a Texas family to be landless”
(Fehrenbach 1985:283). Later, the land laws of the state of Texas were set up in much the same
way, and land also was granted preemptively, through “squatters’ rights.”
One of the major accomplishments of the government that would affect the development of
northcentral Texas was aid for the creation of an initial transportation infrastructure. To
consolidate the towns of the new republic, the Central National Road of the Republic of Texas
was surveyed in 1844. The road connected San Antonio with the towns north to the Red River at
the mouth of the Kiamichi River (WPA 1940:389). Until the spread of railroads in the later part
of the century, roads like this were the main arteries of communication.
One of the most important urban areas to develop during the Republic of Texas period was
Dallas. Although John Neely Bryan initially reconnoitered the Dallas area in 1840 to determine
its suitability for a trading post, troops of the Republic of Texas had removed the Native
American groups with whom he had intended to trade by the time he returned in 1842. As a
result, Bryan became determined to found a settlement in the area where downtown Dallas is
today. In 1846, Bryan began collaborations with Colonel John C. McCoy, a former agent of the
Texas Emigration and Land Company, to promote settlement in Dallas. The two men
successfully lobbied the Texas legislature for the creation of Dallas County, and the settlement of
Dallas was designated as the county seat (McDonald 1978:10).
Although Dallas was formed in 1846, families had started settling south of Dallas about 10 years
earlier with the founding of towns such as Muskabe, Trinity City, Roane, and Wadeville.
Rodney, a typical town of the period and area, was founded by Joshua Graham in 1834 with a
land grant given to him as bounty for fighting in the Texas Revolution. These towns, which
generally supported low-density, rural, agricultural communities, often consisted of a post office,
a school, a cotton gin, and perhaps a blacksmith shop.
American Statehood: 1846–1865
When James Polk became President of the United States, he made a serious effort to annex Texas
into the Union. This expansionist policy was carried out when the U.S. Army moved troops to
the Rio Grande, 150 mi (241 km) south of the traditional U.S./Mexico border of the Nueces
River. After finally receiving the provocation that was politically required to go to war, the U.S.
Army invaded and defeated Mexico, opening the way for the annexation of Texas (Zinn
1995:154–166). Originally part of Henderson County, Kaufman County was established by the
state legislature in December 1848. King’s Fort, the original settlement in the county was
renamed Kaufman and named the county seat in March 1851 (Hart 2008).
Like many of the Southern states, the attitudes about secession before the Civil War were not
uniform in Texas. The sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of northcentral
Texas, including Kaufman County, lay with the secessionist southerners, for a majority of them
had immigrated from the South. Kaufman County itself did not have a substantial slave
population compared to other counties in the state (Hart 2008). However, since the majority of
21

the population had roots in the south, and the cash economy of the area was built on slave-based
agriculture, three-quarters of the population of Kaufman County voted in favor of secession in
1861 (Hart 2008). Some counties, however, supported Sam Houston’s Unionist forces during the
early part of the war (McCroskey 1997).
Post-Civil War: 1865–1900
Northcentral Texas escaped serious, direct effects from the Civil War, being too far from the
centers of fighting to the east and south to be affected by Union forces, and too far east of the
frontier to be affected by the resurgence of Native American problems that accompanied the
withdrawal of U.S. and Texas military forces (Pool 1975:110–113). The defeat of the South in
1865 brought with it the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old slave-based plantation
system, and occupation by the Union army.
The end of slavery resulted in chiefly cosmetic changes in the economic and social landscape of
northcentral Texas. Lacking the cheap and dependable labor resources provided by slavery, the
large plantations of the antebellum period ceased to be economically feasible, and many were
broken up and partially sold off. Most of the land put on the market found its way into the hands
of speculators and investors, producing a new system of sharecropping or tenant farming that
replaced the old plantation system. Productive land was often held by absentee landlords and the
labor supplied by African-American or poor Anglo-American sharecroppers or tenants. Although
this system failed to improve the economic or social status of sharecroppers and tenants, it did
prove to be a successful replacement for the antebellum system and allowed for the continued
disenfranchisement of poor people, no matter their race (Hillard 1990:122–126).
After 1870, the population of northcentral Texas began to increase, and the region began to
recover from the worst effects of the war and the subsequent recession. One of the most
important factors in this recovery was the increasing role of the railroad in the regional economy.
A small amount of railroad construction had occurred prior to the outbreak of the war, when more
than 50 mi (81 km) of track had been laid westward from Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El
Paso, and Pacific Railroad. When railroad construction resumed four years after the Civil War
ended, it continued at a relatively steady rate (WPA 1940). During the 50-year period following
the 1880s, the population of Kaufman County nearly tripled from 15,448 to 40,905 residents
(Hart 2008). The population increase was due in a large part to the introduction of the railroad in
the region, and the late 1800s was the most productive period for the corn, cotton, and cattle
industries of the county (Hart 2008).
Twentieth Century: 1900–Present
Until the beginning of World War I, northcentral Texas remained an agriculture-based region.
The few major cities of Dallas, Fort Worth, Denton, and Sherman served primarily as
transportation hubs to get crops and livestock to market. Beginning with the huge agricultural
and industrial expansion during World War I, the urban areas began to grow and the rural areas
began to alter the landscape of the region. The influx of federal monies would serve as the
harbinger of the New Deal programs of the 1930s through the Cold War and would dramatically
alter the economy and social landscape of northcentral Texas. As World War I began, the
military established several bases in the area, facilitating the rapid development of New South
22

cities in the mid-twentieth century (Goldfield 1982:181–184). Between 1930 and the 1960s,
agriculture and population in the county declined. However, other improvements occurred during
this period. During the Great Depression, New Deal programs such as the Civil Conservation
Corps (CCC) performed agricultural terracing and soil conservation in the region. The
establishment of co-ops accomplished rural electrification. The WPA and other agencies paved
roads and constructed all manner of institutional buildings (i.e., schools, city halls, courthouses,
etc.) across the region. Over one million dollars was spent by the WPA on road and bridge
constructions and other developments in Kaufman County alone (Hart 2008). Oil was discovered
in 1953, and maize agriculture and ranching replaced small farms. In 1960, the population of
Kaufman County reached a twentieth-century low and the county shifted to a predominantly
urban focus. Although agriculture was still a major component, the local economy became
dominated by the manufacturing industry in Terrell, the county’s largest town (Hart 2008). As
the population continues to grow, Kaufman County is becoming more closely linked with the
Dallas-Fort Worth economy.

METHODOLOGY

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, a search of the available archival data was undertaken. The purpose of this
background research was to identify all known archeological sites and historic properties that
might be situated within or near the project area. The results of the research were used to guide
the field methods, to determine the areas in which previously recorded sites would be
encountered, and to locate landforms with the highest probability for retaining archeological
deposits. The data also served as a contextual framework so that any newly recorded sites could
be evaluated for significance.
Site records obtained from the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) maintained by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) were consulted to obtain information on previous investigations
and known sites within a 1-km (0.6-mi) radius of the project area. One archeological site
(41KF124) has been recorded within the search radius, although it does not fall within the project
corridor. The site was identified by S. Alan Skinner of AR Consultants in 1993 as part of a
cultural resources survey of a proposed transmission line (Skinner 1993). The site is located
about 168 m (550 ft) southeast of FM 148 near an unnamed tributary of Buffalo Creek and
consists of three or more floodwater control dams. Skinner contacted the Soil Conservation
Service district conservationist in Kaufman who indicated that the dams were likely built during
the Great Depression by the CCC. During that time, the CCC had been experimenting with
several techniques to control erosion, and site 41KF124 may have been one of its experimental
structures (Skinner 1993). No prehistoric archeological sites were recorded during the 1993
survey, and Skinner (1993) noted that the upland settings of Kaufman County have a very low
potential for containing prehistoric archeological sites (Skinner et al. 1978).
In 2006, an intensive pedestrian survey was conducted along FM 1641 and FM 148 in advance of
a proposed road widening project by Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Young 2007). This survey
overlaps with the current project area for roughly 183 m (660 ft) east of the FM 1641/FM 148
intersection. No archeological sites were located during the 2006 survey, and Young concluded
that there was very little to no potential for cultural deposits to exist within the existing FM 1641
and FM 148 ROWs (Young 2007).

24

The Atlas also lists two additional surveys adjacent to the present project boundary.
Unfortunately, the Atlas provides very limited information concerning the exact nature of these
projects. According to the Atlas, a survey project was conducted in 1983 on both sides of FM
148 near Draw Creek. An additional linear survey was conducted on the southeast side of FM
148 near Stitzle Road. No additional information could be obtained concerning these projects
and no archeological sites are listed in the area.
ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODS
Fieldwork consisted of a windshield reconnaissance survey and limited shovel testing of the
ROW flanking the existing travel lanes of FM 148 within the proposed APE. The survey was
limited to the existing state-owned ROW. The reconnaissance survey was conducted to identify
disturbances within the ROW and areas with potential for intact soils. The general landscape and
previous disturbances were documented and photographed. Shovel tests were placed on a
judgmental basis to confirm the presence/absence of intact soil profiles within the existing ROW.
Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm (12 in) in diameter and were excavated to 80 cm (32 in)
below ground surface (bs) or to the B horizon, if it was encountered first. All shovel test fill was
sifted through 0.64 cm (0.25-in) hardware cloth to identify any subsurface cultural materials that
might be present, and data regarding soil color, texture, and content for each shovel test were
recorded on a standardized form.
A site is defined on the basis of content and extent. When a shovel test yields cultural material,
additional shovel tests are excavated in the cardinal directions in a cruciform pattern at 5-m (16.5ft) intervals around the initial test until two sterile shovel tests are encountered. A site is then
defined within the extent of positive shovel tests. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five
or more cultural items of at least two different artifact materials or classes (e.g., prehistoric stone
tool manufacturing debris exhibiting different raw materials, or manufacturing debris in
combination with stone tools; or historic-era ceramic [or glass] of several different types, or
ceramics in addition to glass) within a 20-m (65.6-ft) square. Cultural remains meeting these
criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted
to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin. Conversely, the discovery of
one or two cultural items (either surface or subsurface) not meeting these criteria is considered an
isolated occurrence of human activity and is simply documented by location and content;
likewise, historic-era material representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not considered
a site, with only location and content documented.
Although no artifacts were collected and thus none require curation, all notes, forms, and
photographs obtained during this project will be curated at TARL.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

RIGHT-OF-WAY INVESTIGATIONS
The project area begins at the intersection of FM 148 and FM 987 just east of the community of
Talty and extends southwestward along FM 148 for 11.4 km (7.1 mi) to its intersection with US
175 near Crandall. The APE is entirely within the existing ROW. The overwhelming majority of
the project APE was heavily disturbed by impacts from road construction and maintenance,
buried and overhead utilities, erosion, driveways, drainage ditches, culverts, and other
infrastructure (Figures 2–4). In total, eight shovel tests were excavated within portions of the
ROW (see Figure 1; Appendix A). Five shovel tests were excavated on the banks of the more
sizeable streams, one shovel test was located on a relatively undisturbed section of the uplands,
and two shovel tests were excavated in the front yard of a historic dwelling near Talty. Although
the number of shovel tests is far less than recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists
and approved by the THC for an intensive shovel test survey, the project area’s upland setting and
high degree of ground disturbance limited the potential for intact subsurface archeological
materials.
Three of the five shovel tests excavated on the banks of stream crossings where bridges will be
replaced by the proposed project were found to be within disturbed contexts. The shovel tests
adjacent to Draw Creek (CSJ 0751-01-041; Shovel Test 2) and Big Brushy Creek Relief #2 (CSJ
0751-01-043; Shovel Tests 3 and 4) yielded very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to dark gray (10YR 4/1)
clay and gravelly clay. Much of the gravel that was found in these shovel tests was composed of
concrete fragments that were identical to the adjacent bridge fill. Although soil structure was
present, the mixed fine-grained sediment and modern gravel suggest disturbance in these areas.
Shovel tests excavated on the northwest side of Buffalo Creek (CSJ 0751-01-034; Shovel Test 1)
and the southeast side of Big Brushy Creek Relief #1 (CSJ 0751-01-042; Shovel Test 5)
contained undisturbed soil profiles. However, no artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests at
these locations. At Buffalo Creek, Shovel Test 1 was excavated on a small area between a fence
line and an eroded portion of the road ditch on the north side of FM 148. The shovel test was
composed of a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) A horizon to a depth of approximately 50 cm. The B
horizon was identified at 50 cm bs and was recognized by a lightening in color to dark gray
(10YR 4/1) and an increase in illuvial carbonate concentrations. At Big Brushy Creek Relief #1,

Shovel Test 5 was located on a low alluvial terrace on the east side of the creek, south of FM 148.
An identical landform is also present on the southwest side of the creek. The shovel test was
composed of a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy and gravelly clay. There was an
observed increase in illuvial carbonates at 50 cm bs, indicating the presence of the B horizon.
The undisturbed portions of both Buffalo Creek and Big Brushy Creek Relief #1 are very small
areas that would not likely yield significant archeological information.
In order to gain an understanding of the degree of disturbance caused by the road ditch along FM
148, one shovel test (Shovel Test #6) was excavated in an uplands setting on the north side of the
road. The entire profile consisted of black (10YR 2/1) clay that is typical of the Houston Black
series. At 30 cm bs, slickensides and wedge-shaped peds were common in the profile, and below
50 cm many medium-sized carbonate nodules were seen. This profile is generally consistent with
the generalized description of the undisturbed Houston Black series, and thus it was concluded
that many portions of the uplands along FM 148 adjacent to open fields may contain undisturbed
contexts. Since the Houston Black is a residual soil formed from weathered bedrock, any
archeological sites in the uplands surrounding FM 148 would likely be present on the surface.
These uplands areas are thus considered low probability for archeological resources.
No shovel tests were excavated in around the Big Brushy Creek bridge (CSJ 0751-01-035). This
area was surveyed and found to be severely impacted on all sides within the APE. The ground
surface on both the north and south sides of FM148 has been built up by more than a meter of fill
from construction of the bridge. The north side of the stream contains a concrete spillway and
underground water pipeline that drains into Big Brushy Creek (Figure 5). On the south side of
the creek, two different surfaces are visible in the creek bank that provide evidence that at least 1
meter below the modern surface is composed of fill from bridge construction (Figures 6 and 7).

SITE 41KF138
One archeological site was recorded during the survey and assigned trinomial 41KF138. The site
consists of a historic dwelling with two outbuildings (a garage with a gravel drive and a shed
southwest of the garage) located approximately 5 m (16 ft) off the ROW approximately 0.5 mile
southwest of the FM148/FM1641 intersection (Figures 8–10). The owner of the house, Mathis
David, believes that this home was built around 1863 and was owned by the Adams family, one
of the original residents of the community of Talty (Melissa Clayborn [Realtor], personal
communication 2009). Shovel Tests 7 and 8 were excavated within the ROW of the front yard of
this property to determine the depositional integrity of the site. Numerous small yellowish red
(5YR 5/6) brick fragments were observed in the upper 15 cm (6 in) of both shovel tests. The
majority of the fragments were small (<1 cm [0.4 in]) and were not collected. One small
fragment of window glass was also observed, but not collected, in Shovel Test 8. Two buried
utility lines are present in the front yard of this property, so it is likely that the depositional
integrity of the archeological site within the ROW has already been compromised.
Unfortunately, access was not granted onto the property by the landowner, so testing was not
performed outside of the ROW, and thus the eastward extent and integrity of the site is unknown.
The building at site 41KF138 is a one-and-one-half-story domestic dwelling. Based on the
dwelling’s combination of a Queen Ann form with Prairie-style aesthetic influence, the building’s
date of construction is estimated to be ca. 1910. Exterior materials consist of horizontal wood
siding and a pyramidal, composite-shingle roof. The building has a pier and beam foundation and
features a square footprint with a slight projection at the rear created by a hipped cross section

that extends slightly beyond the edge of the primary roofline. Three hipped dormers are located
on the northwest façade and northeast and southwest elevations; the northeast and southwest
dormers are located directly across from each other in a cross-hipped form. A partial wrap porch
is located at the northwest façade and southwest elevation. Square wood beam porch supports sit
atop a railing constructed of square vertical wood posts clad with a combination of horizontal
wood and horizontal aluminum sheet siding on the exterior. At the far end of each plane of the
porch is an enclosure. The enclosed area at the northern (façade) corner appears to be original,
but the enclosure on the southwest elevation appears to be a later addition. The wrap porch
appears to have originally extended the length of the southwest elevation and across one-half of
the southeast (rear) elevation.
Fenestration consists primarily of double-hung aluminum sash windows on the first story. A
rectangular stained glass window is located on the northwest elevation of the enclosed area at the
northern corner of the residence, and a bay window is present on the northeast elevation. The
hipped dormers have rectangular window openings flanked by square side lights. The dormers on
the northwest façade and southwest elevation have aluminum sash sliding windows, and the
primary window opening on the northeast dormer is without a window at present. At some point,
pieces of tin ceiling panels were placed in the sidelights of the northwest dormer. Alterations to
window and door openings are apparent on the northwest facade; the location of the rectangular
stained glass window on the north corner appears to have originally been a window the size of
those on the northeast and southwest elevations. A parlor door opening on the southwest wall of
the enclosure was filled in at some point, and a small rectangular window installed in the upper
portion of the opening. A small door and additional siding in what appears to be a former
window opening is present to the south of the main entrance; this alteration also appears to have
been made after original construction.
Despite the alterations made to the building, elements of the dwelling’s Queen Anne form are
evident in the pyramidal roof with lower hipped dormers, bay window, and the wrap porch, which
originally extended to three elevations of the building. The dwelling’s aesthetic, however,
exhibits more of a Prairie influence in the rectangular dormer windows, square post porch
supports, solid porch railing, and overall massing that is less steeply pitched and more
horizontally expressed than in traditional Queen Anne residences. The combination of elements
characteristic of these two styles indicates a construction date of ca. 1910.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The cultural resources investigation documented in this report was undertaken with three primary
management goals in mind:
1.
2.
3.

to locate all historic and prehistoric cultural resources occurring within the designated
project area;
to evaluate the significance of these resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP or designated as an SAL; and
to make recommendations for the treatment of these resources in relation to the proposed
undertaking, based on their NRHP and SAL evaluations.
NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES CRITERIA

The assessment of significance of cultural resources properties is based on federal guidelines.
The criteria to evaluate properties for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Based on regulations set forth by the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), any resource that is included in or eligible for
inclusion in the National Register is a “historic property.” “The term ‘eligible for inclusion in the
National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the
Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR §800.2 [e]).
The ACHP has set forth the following regulations to define significance and to determine
eligibility of cultural resources:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and

(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [39 CFR
Part 60].
34

STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK CRITERIA
Under the Texas Antiquities Code at the state level, archeological sites may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL), provided
that at least one of the following conditions is met:
(1) The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or
one of its political subdivisions; or
(2) The archeological site is situated on private lands that have been specifically designated
as an SAL . . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard
archeological techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s
original characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition
of new information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods
or preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural
Resources Code 1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section
191.094 and Chapter 41.7, Antiquities Code of Texas].
If a property is owned by the city, it technically meets SAL Condition 1, regarding political
subentities of Texas. At issue, however, is whether a site meeting that criterion is significant and
eligible for designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the National Register.
At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination of
whether a cultural resources property possesses the potential to make a contribution to one or
more of the above-defined criteria. The objective is to determine which cultural resources
properties could yield further data regarding regional, methodological, or theoretical research
questions. Therefore, adequate information on site function, context, integrity, and chronological
placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for
cultural investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography and temporal
period, determination of site context and chronological placement of the cultural properties is a
particularly important objective during the inventory process.
SUMMARY
No cultural materials were discovered within the surveyed project APE in contexts that were of
high probability to yield prehistoric or historic cultural deposits. Much of the project area
demonstrates ground disturbance related to the development of properties along FM 148 and their
infrastructure. No cultural materials were observed in shovel tests or exposed areas along the
streams that cross the project area.
One historic site (41KF138) was identified on the south side of FM 148 near the community of
Talty. The historic dwelling is located outside of the current ROW, and thus shovel tests were
limited to within the ROW, where buried utility lines are present. Both shovel tests revealed
small pieces of fractured brick, and one yielded a window glass fragment. Because of the lack of
35

right-of-entry, it is yet unknown whether undisturbed portions of the site remain outside of the
ROW. The building is a one-and-one-half-story domestic dwelling. Based on the dwelling’s
combination of a Queen Ann form with Prairie style aesthetic influence, the building’s date of
construction is estimated to be ca. 1910.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Within the present ROW, no further archeological investigation is necessary due to the absence of
undisturbed cultural materials as defined under 36 CFR §60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32),
and 13 TAC 26.8. A small portion of site 41KF138 does, however, fall within the current project
ROW. Shovel tests in the ROW on this site indicate that this portion of the site has been
previously impacted by road construction and buried utilities. The large remainder of the site
falls outside of the current project ROW and could not be adequately examined for intact
archeological deposits and/or features. Therefore, the site is considered of unknown eligibility
for the National Register of Historic Places or consideration as a State Archeological Landmark.
However, should the project extend outside the current ROW and the site is threatened due to
construction, then in accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2, additional archival
and fieldwork would be necessary.
