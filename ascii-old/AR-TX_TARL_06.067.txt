ABSTRACT
In 1976 archeological investigations were conducted in
Palmetto Bend Reservoir in areas outside the primary dam
construction site.
Archeological survey, re-eva1uative testing
and botanical sampling were employed to select sites for inten­
sive excavation.
Eighteen new archeological sites were recorded
during the survey and twenty-five sites were tested.
Botanical
information was gathered from forty-five quadrats distributed
over the reservoir area.
On the basis of the data collected
during this 1976 season, ten archeological sites are recommended
for intensive excavation.

PREFACE
Developing a cultural, historic, and explanatory framework
for the archeology of the Northwest Gulf Coastal Plain is a
complex process. Palmetto Bend Reservoir will affect archeo­
logical localities which represent a significant fraction of
the prehistoric remains on the Gulf Coastal Plain. This volume
is the fourth in a series under the heading Pa~metto Bend
Resepvoip Sepies.
Volume IV, like the preceding three volumes,
is principally a descriptive and planning document designed to
provide a sound framework within which to structure the final
intensive excavations.
The information presented in this manuscript was collected
in February and March of 1976, during the intensive survey phase
of the Palmetto Bend archeological research program.
The emphasis
of this phase was on areas other than the primary dam construction
site, since that region had been investigated in an earlier
season of field work.
All volumes in the series (to date) are the result of
field work and analysis contracted by the National Park Service
with funds from the Bureau of Reclamation, and carried out by
the Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at
Austin.
Artifactual material and notes will be stored at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Balcones Research
Center, The University of Texas at Austin.

INTRODUCTION
Since the summer of 1974, the Texas Archeological Survey
has been conducting investigations in the Navidad River
watershed, accumulating information on the cultural resources
of that area before they are inundated by the Palmetto Bend
Reservoir.
The first phase of this research was a listing of the
prehistoric and architectural cultural resources in the lower
end of the reservoir.
At the request of the Bureau of
Reclamation, the 1974 investigations focused upon the planned
dam axis, since clearance of the resources in that area was
required before reservoir construction could begin.
Testing during the first phase of intensive investigations
of sites in this area indicated that the archeological deposits
vary tremendously in depth and scale over extremely short
distances.
Such a lack of uniformity within deposits suggested
the need for an updated testing program.
The Bureau of
Reclamation supported this additional testing and the examin­
ation of areas which had not been previously investigated due
to their inaccessibility during the earlier survey (Mallouf,
Fox and Briggs 1973). The work was supervised by the South­
west Region, National Park Service.
This report describes the cultural localities discovered
during survey operations and provides data on biological
sampling of the area.
The information collected during these
investigations has, in turn, been used to select the sites
most appropriate for intensive excavation.
Sites deemed
appropriate were, primarily, those which the testing procedure
indicated had undergone the least change since cultural
deposition.
Some sites were selected for excavation because
of their potential for solving specific research problems.
All sites which appeared to have experienced minimal distur­
bance, and some which retained good research potential despite
more extensive alteration, were selected for intensive exca­
vation in the final phase of work.
The initial Texas Archeological Survey report, Prehiatori~
Ar~heologi~al Inveatigationa at Palmetto Bend Reaervoir:
Phaae
1 (McGuff 1978), outlines the factors which are expected to
lead to the nearly total destruction of cultural resources in
the reservoir area.

during the 1976 season at Palmetto Bend Reservoir was to
select sites for intensive excavation based on the results
of a program of intensive survey, evaluative testing and
biological sampling.
At least one-sixth of the reservoir
had not been surveyed for cultural resources during the
previous field work because of heavy vegetal cover or denial
of access by landowners, or because these areas had not yet
been designated as subject to the effects of reservoir impound­
ment (Mallouf, Fox and Briggs 1973). At the beginning of the
1976 season, an estimated 5,000 acres remained to be surveyed:
1.

the confluence of Sandy Creek and the Navidad River
(estimated area:
320 acres)

2.

the western side of the Navidad River for approximately
one-half mile on either side of Highway III
(estimated area: 1000 acres)

3.

the confluence of Mustang Creek with the Navidad River
(estimated area:
640 acres)

4.

the north side of Mustang Creek west of Highway 172
to Devers Creek
(estimated area:
300 acres)

5.

the Brushy Creek/Sandy Creek confluence and surrounding
areas
(estimated area:
300 acres)

6.

the east side of Sandy Creek, north of the confluence
with the Navidad River, for approximately two river
miles
(estimated area:
640 acres)

7.

areas along the primary terrace
(area not estimated)

8.

eight areas, contiguous to the lake, which are planned
for the development of recreation sites by the Bureau
of Reclamation.
These were designated after the con­
clusion of the initial survey.
(estimated area:
2000 acres)

The Texas State Historical Survey Committee located eighty­
two archeological sites and tested seven during the intensive
survey of the reservoir vicinity (Mallouf, Fox and Briggs 1973:
56).
In addition, testing was recommended for prehistoric sites
41 JK 31, JK 53, JK 58, JK 66, JK 68 and JK 74 and historic
sites 41 JK 51, JK 52, JK 55, JK 75 and JK 106 (Mallouf, Fox
and Briggs 1973: Tables 14 and 17). As time permitted, other

RESEARCH:

OBJECTIVES AND IMPLEMENTATION

promising sites located, but not recommended for testing, by
that survey were also investigated.
During the 1974 season three of the five prehistoric
sites examined contained in situ cultural deposits which
varied from 20 centimeters to 3 meters in maximum depth over
a horizontal distance of 2-3 meters.
In addition, the results
of the 1974 season indicated that the condition of the cul­
tural deposits varied considerably within a single site.
Therefore, the testing of as many sites as possible was indi­
cated in order to clarify stratigraphic associations.
Finally, intensive excavation and testing of sites near
the dam axis during the 1974 season indicated that a more
complete understanding of the prehistory and history of the
regio~ depended upon sampling sites in each of the various
areas of resource availability.
In the case of the Palmetto
Bend area, zones of differing resource availability may be
equated with biological zones, since the underlying bedrock
geology is quite consistent in this portion of the coastal
plain.
No quantitative research on fauna or flora had previously
been done at Palmetto Bend.
The locations of known sites
within the roughly outlined biological zones provided by
McGuff and Davidson (1978) suggested that the pattern of
prehistoric settlement was within specific zones.
Davidson's
methods, however, were not suitable for an in-depth study of
the relationships between site location and ecological situ­
ation.
In order to accurately identify the ecological zones,
and to map their boundaries and sample the diversity within
them, it was necessary to obtain quantitative information.
All of the prehistoric sites excavated in 1974 were within
the bluff top forest zone.
This suggested that more sensitive
ecological indicators were needed to permit the selection of
a site sample representative of the diversity of functions
required for the exploitation of a wide variety of resources.
The first priority of the field program was to survey and
test as many sites as possible.
Biological sampling was
technically the second priority, but it was often lent added
immediacy by the impending clearing operations in the reser­
voir basin.
When possible, the biological sampling program
was carried on in conjunction with surveyor testing activities.
As the research progressed, it became increasingly clear
that such a strategy could not be used to categorize sites
because archeological remains were not located in areas of
differing resource availability, but were confined almost
exclusively to the bluff top forest environment.
Excavations
at these bluff top forest sites indicated an emphasis on pre­
historic exploitation of the riparian zones of the river
bottom and the river itself.
However, prior to the 1976
season only one prehistoric site was located on the flood­
plain (Mallouf, Fox and Briggs 1973).
The 1976 investigations

RESEARCH:

yielded a second, but neither site was intact.
It was,
therefore, not possible to place sites in environmental
exploitation categories according to their locations within
certain environmental zones.
A more detailed analysis of
the exploi~ation pattern of the area would seem to require
the information which will be forthcoming from excavation
in the bluff top forest sites.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESEARCH
Survey Procedures
Survey work was initiated in the more open upland areas
by two-man crews who walked transects.
Floodplain areas are
obviously more susceptible to deposition than the edge of the
secondary terrace; this, coupled with the thick overgrowth,
has resulted in differential archeological visibility which
probably precluded recognition of sites in the floodplain
during the initial survey.
Survey in lowland areas involved
monitoring clearing activities there and, after rain had
fallen on cleared areas, transecting them, using two-man crews.
Testing Procedures
Work during the 1974 season proved that the results of
excavation of archeological sites in the Palmetto Bend area
were a poor indicator of site condition and content.
Sur­
ficial evidence was even more inconclusive, and in some
cases suggested quite erroneous conclusions about the buried
archeological deposits.
Thus, the testing program in 1976
was designed to open wide areas of each site tested, and to
investigate as many sites as possible.
Impoundment of the
reservoir was fast approaching, so the testing program had
to be economical in its use of time.
In addition, since the
tested sites would be considered for intensive excavation,
damage to the archeological deposits must be minimal and
still extract the information required to make decisions on
further work.
The apparent extent of each site was ascertained by care­
ful surface collection. Once the surficial area of the site
had been determined, two transects were laid perpendicular
to each other, quartering the exposed portions.
Points were
systematically spaced on these transects, usually 10 meters
apart.
Each point on a transect became the location of a
backhoe test from which matrix was excavated in approximate

RESEARCH:

OBJECTIVES AND IMPLEMENTATION,'

6

20 centimeter arbitrary levels.
One-tenth of a cubic meter
of matrix from each arbitrary level was dry screened through
1/4-inch mesh.
At each sample location, deposits were dis­
turbed in an area only 60 centimeters wide and 1 meter long
-- the width of the backhoe shovel and the length required
for that shovel to remove matrix from the ground.
Samples were taken in 20 centimeter levels at each 10
meter interval until at least one, and ideally, two, arbitrary
levels had proven sterile of cultural debris.
Transects were
extended until cultural material no longer occurred in any
arbitrary level.
One wall at each 10 meter distant test
site was cleaned, and stratigraphic levels (primary and/or
genetic) recorded.
This technique allowed quick determination of extent,
deviation in maximum depth, and artifact or refuse density
variability within separate sites, while incurring minimal
damage.
Biological Sampling Procedures
Construction activities in the reservoir area have had
a definite impact on the biological communities there.
The
long-term patterns of the local fauna have probably been
disrupted, and the extended study needed to obtain distri­
bution and seasonality data is not within the scope of this
work.
The most stable remaining portion of the biological
community was the flora.
Therefore, groups of associated
floral species were used in mapping the boundaries of bio­
logical zones.
Vegetation was sampled through the use of quadrats,
which were located in less disturbed portions of the plant
communities because the sampling was designed to provide
insights into the past distribution of biological communities
and not the effects of recent human activities on the present
environment.
Davidson and McGuff (1978) had provided rough boundaries
for biological zones which allowed an estimate of th~per­
centage of total coverage of each community.
The selection
of quadrats within each community was stratified according
to those estimates.
The sampling procedure consisted of the identification
of trees within 25 x 25 1lle-te"(' 'q8-l.ad r at.$.' F:t:\eq,tterrcy '0 f, "eatihsp ec ies
was noted, and the basal circumference of the plants measured.
Shrubs, plants with a basal circumference of less than 20
centimeters, were counted by species within the same 25 x 25
meter quadrat.
Forbs and grasses were measured for presence
or absence within the quadrats in selected 1 x 1 meter squares.
The location and general condition of the sample locality was
also recorded.

SURVEY RESULTS
All the previously unsurveyed areas were inspected,
except some portions of the primary floodplain which had not
been exposed by reservoir clearing operations. Poor surface
visibility has been a problem in those same areas during
every phase of the Palmetto Bend investigations.
This season's survey of portions of Palmetto Bend Res­
ervoir resulted in the identification and recording of
eighteen archeological sites, brin8±ng~the total in the
reservoir area to 101.
Four of the eighteen newly recorded
sites are historic ~n temporal affiliation, thirteen are
prehistoric, and one is a multicomponent site, both historic
and prehistoric.
Eleven of the eighteen sites were located
in previously unexamined areas, and the remaining seven durtng
tesurvdy:ofaYeas-which had been cleared in preparation for
construction.
The newly discovered sites occupy a range of environmental
situations.
Three floodplain sites were identified, one pre­
historic and two historic.
A single historic site was recorded
on the prairie. The bulk of the sites, one historic, twelve
prehistoric and one multicomponent, were located on the bluff­
tops.
The brief site descriptions which follow are based solely
on data collected during the 1976 survey operations.
The
additional information which was recovered during the testing
of sites 41 JK 162, 163, 165, 166, 167, 172, 175, 176 and 178
is presented in the section entitled 'Testing Results.'
Testing results often substantially altered the site evalu­
ations based on surface evidence alone.
41 JK 161
This site is located north of Haynes Road, in an area
not previously surveyed.
The elevation is approximately 8
meters m.s.l.
The site appears to have been a late nineteenth
or early twentieth century Navidad River crossing.
Several
trees on the site are wrapped with cables or have initials
carved on them. A road depression 2 to 3 meters in width
extends south from the river, clearly visible but partially
overgrown with trees. A portion of the river bank has been
worn or excavated out so that the road depression sloped down
to the level of the river.
No artifacts were collected.
An alternative explanation for the observed features is
that the site represents an attempt at flood control. Until
recently, it was common practice to string cables across a
river to snag debris during flood stage and thus slow the
river flow.

41 JK 162
Located in a previously unsurveyed area, the site is 160
meters southwest of an ephemeral stream and 150 meters east
of a freshwater marsh in the floodplain of the Navidad River.
The site is in bluff top forest, overlooking a tall grass
prairie to the north and the Navidad floodplain to the east.
On-site slope is 15 to 20 percent.
The long axis of the site
parallels the Navidad River.
This Late Prehistoric camp contains articulated bones of
large mammals, probably bison.
The archeological stratum
appears to be approximately 0.1 meter thick.
A large portion
of the site has been destroyed by borrow activities during
construction of Highway 111.
Two hundred twenty-seven
artifacts were collected from the 2500 square meter site.
41 JK 163
The site is located in a previously unsurveyed area on a
knoll which protrudes into the floodplain on the west side of
the Navidad River.
The cultural deposits are approximately 15
meters above sea level, and 0.5 meter thick. Archaic and
Late Prehistoric components are represented in an open midden
deposit covering approximately 10,000 square meters of bluff­
top forest.
The long axis of the site is parallel to the
Navidad River.
41 JK 164
This late nineteenth century road and crassing of a dry
tributary was located in a previously unsurveyed portion of
the upland prairie, at an elevation of 10 to 20 meters m.s.l.
The long axis of the site parallels the Navidad River.
Ear­
thenware sherds, barbed wire and stoneware were found.
41 JK 165
The site is located in an area southeast of the confluence
of Mustang Creek and the Navidad River which had been covered
during a previous survey.
Two distinct components occur, an
Early Archaic component in a red paleosol and a Late Prehistoric
component in a sandy loam matrix which shows little evidence of

soil horizon development.
The site covers 1,800 square meters
on a bluff top ridge between a dry tributary and the Navidad
River, and contains scattered bones, lithics and sherds.
Slope varies from 2 to 20 percent on the site, and elevation
is approximately 11 meters m.s.l. The long axis of the site
parallels the Navidad River.
A dirt road and borrow pits
have seriously decreased the integrity of the site.

41 JK 166
The site is located in a previously unsurveyed area
between the Navidad River and Mustang Creek, at an elevation
of 15 meters m.s.l.
It is 140 meters west-northwest of a
pond in an abandoned river channel.
The area, on a bluff top
with a 5 to 10 percent slope, has suffered considerable dis­
turbance due to livestock activity, clearing, cultivation and
bulldozing.
The site was defined on the basis of three
flakes found within 3 meters of each other in an eroded
area.
The possibility of buried material exists, but nothing
can be determined about site size and orientation.
41 JK 167
The site is situated between the Navidad River and Mustang
Creek, in a bluff top area which was not explored during the
Historical Survey Committee's intensive survey. The area is
approximately 17 meters m.s.l., with an on-site slope of 5 to
10 percent. At least 5000 square meters of area are thinly
scattered with lithics, bone and shell, generally visible
only where rodents have disturbed the surface. The cultural
deposits are an estimated 0.3 meter in depth, and the mat­
erial recovered from them suggests a Late Prehistoric temporal
affiliation. The site axis parallels the Navidad River.

4lJK 168
This site lies in a previously unsurveyed area east of
the Navidad River and north of a dry tributary, in a bluff top
forest environment at 15 meters m.s.l. Large mammal bones
and lithic scatter made up the surficial evidence.
The site has been cleared for pasture and borrow material
was removed for construction of Highway 111.
As a consequence
of this disturbance, what little remains of the site has been
badly eroded.

Two temporal components are represented in this site,
the early Late Prehistoric and the early nineteenth century.
It is located on the east side of Sandy Creek in an area which
had been previously surveyed.
The slope on the bluff top site
ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Portions of the site have been
bulldozed and cleared of vegetation.
The long axis of the
site runs parallel to the flow of Sandy Creek. The cultural
deposits are estimated to be 0.5 meter thick.

41 JK 170
The site is on the south side of the Navidad River, in
a previously unsurveyed bluff top forest area.
The elevation
is 21 meters m.B.l. and the on-site slope is from 1 to 5
percent.
Cultural material was limited to a small lithic
scatter of secondary and interior flakes.
No shell, sherds
or burnt rocks were observed. The area of the site is 150
square meters, with the long axis parallel to the Navidad
River.

41 JK 171
This site is on the east bank of Sandy Creek, in an area
to which access had not previously been available. The site
is situated in bluff top forest, with an elevation of 18 meters
m.s.l. and an on-site slope of 5 to 10 percent.
The cultural
remains consisted of an open lithic scatter approximately 80
square meters in extent, with no associated or faunal mater­
ial.
The long axis of the site parallels Sandy Creek.

41 JK 172
The site is in a previously uninvestigated area on the
west side of Sandy Creek, on a floodplain levee adjacent to
a cut-off channel.
The area is floodplain forest with an
on-site slope of 5 to 10 percent.
Surficial evidence was
limited to flakes.

41 JK 173
The site was on a previously unsurveyed area of bluff top
forest on the south end of a ridge which projects into the
floodplain of the Navidad River.
The elevation of the site
area is 11 meters m.s.l., and the slope is 5 to 10 percent.
This lithic scatter, which is estimated to have had an origi­
nal depth of no more than 0.3 meter, has been destroyed by
oil facility construction activities.
The long axis of the
site paralleled the Navidad River.
41 JK 174
The site is east of a small wash, on a ridge which pro­
jects into the Navidad floodplain.
The elevation is 14 meters
m.s.l.
The area has been investigated previously.
This
historic homesite dated from between A.D. 1870 and 1900, and
covered 1000 square meters with a long axis parallel to the
river.
The site has been destroyed by clearing.
41 JK 175
This Late Prehistoric site is located in the bluff top
forest at an elevation of 13 meters m.s.l.
The slope on the
site is from 5 to 10 percent.
The area had been surveyed
previously.
The site, an estimated 6000 square meters in extent, is
on a bluff adjacent to a freshwater lake in the Navidad flood­
plain, with its axis paralleling the river.
The cultural
deposits, estimated at 0.3 meter thick, consist of ceramics,
lithics and bone.
There were 357 artifacts collected from
the surface.
The site has been damaged by the construction
of oil facilities.
41 JK 176
This prehistoric site lies in a previously surveyed area.
It is in bluff top forest on the slope between the uplands and
the Navidad floodplain.
The elevation of the site is 9 meters
m.~.l., and the on-site slope ranges from 10 to 20 percent.
Surficial evidence is limited to lithic scatter, with no
ceramics, shell, bone or burned rock visible.
The condition
of the site has been adversely affected by the clearing of
vegetation.

This site is on a low levee between the present channel
of the Navidad River and an overflow channel.
This area is
in floodplain forest on the primary terrace of the Navidad,
at an elevation of 9 meters m.s.l.
Slope in the region
varies from 1 to 5 percent.
The cultural remains are those of a late nineteenth
century dump, and cover an area of approximately 200 square
meters with a deposit 0.1 meter thick.
The dump may have
been along a road, but this possible association could not
be proven because the area had already been cleared.
41 JK 178
This site is an open Late Prehistoric midden with fresh­
water shellfish, bone, snails, lithics, ceramics, charcoal
and burned rocks in its 0.3 meter deep deposit.
It is loca­
ted at 14 meters m.s.l. in the bluff top forest on the lower
portion of the slope between the uplands and the Mustang
Creek floodplain.
On-site slope is from 1 to 5 percent.
The site area had been previously surveyed.
TESTING RESULTS
The twenty-five localities tested this season included
all those sites recommended by the Historical Survey Committee,
plus nine localities discovered during the 1976 survey and
three localities previously observed by the Historical Survey
Committee crew.
Six of the deposits investigated originated
in the Historic period, fifteen in the Prehistoric period, and
four had mixed historic and prehistoric associations.
The
testing procedures have provided a clear indication of the
condition and contents of the sites tested. That information
has in turn been important to the selection of archeological
sites for intensive excavation.
Some of the basic information on the tested sites is
presented below.
It indicates, in part, each site's potential
for further productive investigation. The raw data on these
tested localities is provided in the accompanying data appen­
dices.

Three spatially distinct compon,ents were recognized and
tested at 41 JK 31. The North Component is the location of a
late nineteenth century mill or irrigation pump which stood
at the edge of a Late Prehistoric sherd and lithic scatter.
A prehistoric lithic scatter composes the Central Component.
The South Component contains the remains of a historic home­
site which was probably constructed between 1830 and 1850.
All three of these localities were tested, using a backhoe,
according to the techniques described in the Implementation
of Research section.
North Component
Sampling of the North Component indicated that archeo­
logical material with Late Prehistoric affiliations was
present over an area of 1450 square meters, with the long
axis of the site parallel to the Navidad River.
Although a
pump platform for a mill or irrigation facility had been
constructed at the edge of the prehistoric refuse, little
historic material was recovered during the testing operation.
The prehistoric deposit varied from 6 to 65 centimeters
in thickness with the most substantial accumulations near
the river bank.
The average thickness of the cultural deposit
was 20 centimeters.
It is therefore estimated that the cul­
tural deposits at the site were originally distributed within
about 290 cubic meters of fill.
However, approximately two­
thirds of the North Component has been altered by historic
agricultural activities and the construction of the pump
platform which abuts the site. An estimated 97 cubic meters
of the site remain relatively undisturbed.
The surface collection from the North Component suggested
that pottery, faunal remains and lithics would be recovered
from the cultural deposit. However, our sample, which was
collected from around the edges of the site, yielded only
lithics.
Central Component
Surface collecting of this component suggested that this
area of the site was approximately 725 square meters in extent.
This portion of 41 JK 31 was first recognized during the 1976
testing of the North Component. Surficial evidence consisted
of a scattering of small interior flakes and chips with a
density of approximately one item per square meter. Testing
in this area demonstrated that the deposit has no significant
depth.

Southern Component
Historic refuse covered an area of 6500 square meters in
a plowed field.
Two plow zones occurred, one 30 centimeters
deep and a second which extends to 50 centimeters.
The cul­
tural material was confined to these two zones, particularly
the upper, and hence nothing remains in place. Brick foun­
dations had been removed some years earlier because they
were an obstruction to plowing.
The Southern Component of
the site has been destroyed.
41 JK 33
This site, the early historic Sutherland homestead, dates
to approximately 1830. The exact size of the site was not
determined because a portion~of it extends beyond the reser­
voir property and thus beyond the limits of subsurface test­
ing.
The depth of the cultural deposits varies from 5 to 50
centimeters below the present surface.
In two cases, testing
revealed brick coursings still in place.
In addition, the
site contains a wide array of mid-nineteenth century artifacts
and well-preserved faunal remains which seem to be in an un­
disturbed context. Site damage resulting from bulldozer brush
removal is evidenced by scrape marks on the coursed bricks.
However, what remains of the site is in good condition.

41 JK 51
The remains of this historic homesite date to the late
nineteenth century, and fall within the confines of the
William Menefee grant. Surface indications suggested that
the site covered an area of approximately 2400 square meters,
but subsurface testing revealed no undisturbed cultural
deposits.
In 1972, the homesite area was covered by a thick
stand of oak, but by 1976 the area had been cleared and the
historic remains largely destroyed in the process.

41 JK 52
The remains of this home, constructed between 1840 and
1850, are located within the bounds of the T. Menefee 1830
land grant.
Testing indicated that cultural refuse extended
over an area of 4000 square meters, but was entirely within
the plow zone.
Although the presence of a northern and a

RESEARCH:

OBJECTIVES AND IMPLEMENTATION

15

southern concentration of artifacts may reflect the previous
existence of two structures, plowing has so disturbed the
site that it is not suitable for intensive excavation.
Approximately one-third of the site is outside the limits
of Bureau of Reclamation property.
41 JK 53
This site, which originally covered an estimated 30,000
square meters, includes both a prehistoric and an historic
component. Much of the site has been removed by private
interests for use as fill.
An isolated Middle Archaic fresh­
water shell midden was located. The deposit contains a high
density of cultural refuse, and is approximately 60 centi­
meters thick.
The site was not tested during the 1976 season because
so much of it was already exposed by land fill removal.
Despite its partially disturbed condition, 41 JK 53 retains
high scientific value because in situ Middle Archaic middens
are so scarce in the reservoir area.
Most sites of this age
were destroyed during the erosional sequences documented by
McGuff (1978).
Rather than damage the remaining deposits by
further testing, this site was left intact for intensive
excavation.
41 JK 54
This homesite was occupied between approximately 1900
and 1940, when the house was razed. Testing indicated that
cultural residues were scattered over approximately 3500
square meters, with some features extending to 0.5 meter
below the present surface.
The cultural refuse has undergone
little recent disturbance.
41 JK 55
The site is located on the north side of Mustang Creek,
on a ridge between two intermittent tributaries.
It is not
on Bureau of Reclamation property. The bulk of the cultural
refuse is associated with an historic homesite occupied
between 1860 and 1880, but there is some indication of a
prehistoric component as well. The site originally covered
an area estimated at 2750 square meters in extent. The depth

RESEARCH:

16

of the original deposit cannot be estimated because the
cultural refuse has been so disturbed by plowing and clearing.
4lJK 58
This open prehistoric midden is on a steep bluff on the
south bank of Mustang Creek, at an elevation of approximately
17 meters m.s.l.
The site is an estimated 3750 square meters
in area.
The deposit, consisting of scattered lithics,
charcoal and bone, averages 0.5 meter in depth. Artifact
density averages about 20 items per cubic meter. Testing
indicates that the site dates from the Archaic period.
Unfortunately, the integrity of the site has been destroyed
by root plowing and erosion.

41 JK 59
The site covers approximately 625 square meters in an
improved pasture on the south side of Mustang Creek. The
historic component, believed to be derived from a schoolhouse
reported at or near this location between 1850 and 1900, has
been damaged by plowing.
An intact prehistoric component,
apparently deposited during the Archaic period, is buried
under 75 centimeters of fill and averages 10 centimeters in
thickness.
This prehistoric component averages a rather
uniform 25 items per cubic meter across the site.
Damage
to the site has been limited to rodent burrowing, root
activity, and the subsurface testing.

41 JK 66
This open midden on the north bank of Mustang Creek
originally covered an area of about 1500 square meters, with
the cultural deposit an average of 1 meter thick.
Thus,
approximately 1500 cubic meters of cultural fill should
theoretically be available for excavation.
In fact, 20
percent of the site has been destroyed by the removal of top
soil, 5 percent has been damaged by plowing, and 5 percent
is located on private land outside government supervision,
leaving 1050 cubic meters available for research.
The site material is contained in several distinct zones
which demonstrate considerable variability of artifact types.
The age of the cultural deposits may range from early Archaic

RESEARCH:

OBJECTIVES AND IMPLEMENTATION.

17

to Late Prehistoric.
Shell, bone, lithics, ceramics and
burned rock were contained in several distinct zones which
demonstrated considerable variability on artifact type
distribution.
A sample of 2 cubic meters of fill, drawn
from various portions of the site, yielded the following
approximate densities of cultural debris per cubic meter:
thirty lithic items, twenty-five ceramic sherds, 330 bone
items, twenty shell items.
41 JK 68
Lithics and ceramics with Archaic and Late Prehistoric
associations were located on a bluff just east of Sandy Creek,
at an elevation of 20 meters m.s.l.
The site is immediately
outside the bounds of the land purchased for the reservoir.
Extent of the site has not been established.
Vegetation on the site has been cleared, and the con­
dition~of the archeological deposit has been further affected
by the construction of a cabin and the excavation of a small
pond.
41 JK 74
This open prehistoric midden is located on a terrace slope
14 meters above sea level.
It is near the edge of the flood­
plain forest and adjacent to the present channel of Mustang
Creek.
The cultural component consists of faunal remains,
lithics, ceramics and burned calcium carbonate concretions.
The density of faunal material is high, and its preservation
excellent.
It is not possible to estimate the original
extent of the site, because so much damage has already
resulted from borrow activities.
The small portion of the
site which is still intact is about 50 centimeters thick.
41 JK 75
The site is located on a bluff near the confluence of
Sandy Creek and the Navidad River.
41 JK 75 is approxi­
mately 5000 square meters in extent, and the cultural deposits
average 15 centimeters in thickness.
The site has been
severely damaged by land clearing and the laying of a gas
pipeline.
It is an open midden with bone, shell, ceramics

18

and lithics which suggest a Late Prehistoric date for the
site.
The overall condition of the site is poor.
41 JK 106
Located west of the Navidad River, 41 JK 106 is the site
of a plantation owned by the Brackenridge family between 1830
and 1860.
The apparent area of the site is nearly 10,000
square meters, but it is likely that vegetation clearing and
the construction of a natural gas pipeline have dispersed
artifacts over a greater area than they occupied when the
site was first abandoned.
A very large cistern, with a
1,200 cubic meter capacity, remains intact.
The site is in
generally poor condition, but has local historic significance.
41 JK 162
Located at 11 meters m.s.l. on a bluff top to the west
of the Navidad River~ the site is a Late Prehistoric scatter
of ceramics, lithics, and large mammal bones which are prob­
ably those of a bison.
41 JK 162 was originally about 5600 square meters in
extent. Excavation of'f~ll for State Highway 111 has des­
troyed 90 percent of the site, leaving only 600 square meters
with any depositional integrity.
The average thickness of
the remaining deposit is 5 centimeters. Thirty cubic meters
of the site's cultural deposits remain in good condition.
In the least damaged portions of the site, activity
areas seem to be represented by differential distribution of
various artifact types.
Density of lithic debris, as esti­
mated from tests across the site, is 125 items per cubic
meter.
Ceramic density is approximately fif~~en items per
cuhi:c meter.
41 JK 163
The site is an open midden, west of the Navidad River
on a peninsulalike extension of the bluff top into the flood­
plain.
The elevation is 15 meters m.s.l.
The dense bluff­
top forest vegetation prevented systematic testing of the
entire site. Testing around the perimeter of the site
indicated an original extent of about 6500 square meters,
including several spatially distinct cultural refuse accumu­
lations.
The average thickness of the cultural deposit is

RESEARCH:

OBJECTIVES AND IMPLEMENTATION

19

0.5 meter.
Minimal damage to the remains has resulted from road
construction and borrow activity, and rodent burrowing in
cleared portions of the site.
In general, the site is in
excellent condition.

41 JK 165
Little cultural debris was collected during testing of
this 1800 square meter site.
Testing indicates that very
little, if any, of the cultural deposit has ~been~un.a&feC!-tecl~
by historic activities including excavations for fill,
clearing of vegetation and road building.
The open early
Archaic and Late Prehistoric middens have been virtually
destroyed.
The Archaic component appears to have been con­
tained within the eroded remnant of a paleosol.

41 JK 166
The site is located on a bluff top between the Navidad
River and Mustang Creek.
Surficial evidence suggested a
buried prehistoric deposit but none was encountered in subse­
quent testing.

41 JK 167
The site is located in the bluff top forest on a ridge
between the Navidad River and Mustang Creek.
Testing revealed
subsurface deposits covering an ar~a approximately 3500 square
meters in extent, with an average thickness of 20 centimeters.
The site therefore contains approximately 700 cubic meters of
cultural fill.
The density of cultural debris is high.
Testing indi­
cates an average density of eighty-five itefu~2ot ~~thic~ct
deb£is and five ceramic sherds per cubic meter over the area
of the site.
Variability in artifact type and density over
the site area are great.
The bulk of this site is composed of buried deposits
which have retained much of their integrity despite the fact
that the area has been cleared of vegetation by bulldozers.

RESEARCH:

41 JK 172
The site is located on the primary floodplain of Sandy
Creek; two flakes were discovered during initial survey. The
surficial evidence might have indicated either a buried site
or the remnant of an eroded site. Testing of the locality
revealed no buried cultural horizons.

41 JK 175
The site is a Late Prehistoric deposit located on the
edge of a bluff overlooking the Navidad River valley.
Testing
suggests that the original deposit covered an area of 3500
square meters. However, cultural levels have been completely
destroyed by construction of oil field support facilities.
No intact cultural levels were discovered.

41 JK 176
This site is a thin, Prehistoric lithic scatter covering
an area of approximately 1600 square meters. The cultural
deposit, originally about 20 centimeters thick, contains an
average of ten lithic items per cubic meter of fill.
The
site is in poor condition as a result of erosion and a high
rate of rodent activity.
Test excavations encountered three
active rodent burrows per square meter of the site.

41 JK 178
Sampling indicated that materials of Late Prehistoric
affiliation covered an area 1000 square meters in extent, with
a fairly consistent deposit depth of 25 centimeters. Since
approximately 50 percent of the site has been destroyed by
clearing and earth removal, an estimated 125 cubic meters of
intact cultural fill remains.
Testing suggests that the
remainder of the site contains average densities of sixty­
five lithic items, thirty-five ceramic items, thirty bone
fragments and twenty mussel valves per cubic meter of fill.
Certain types of cultural residues, particularly bivalves,
tend to cluster in certain portions of the site.

OBJECTIVES' AND IMPLEMENTATION

BOTANICAL SAMPLING RESULTS
During the 1976 season, forty-five quadrats were sampled
to define botanical communities.
Of these, 35.6 percent were
placed in the bluff top forest communities, 8.9 percent in the
riparian forest and 55.5 percent in the floodplain forest.
No quadrats were located in the prairie grasslands.
In
contrast, the distribution of these communities within the
project area is approximately 53.5 percent bluff top forest,
0.5 percent riparian forest, 12.5 percent floodplain forest,
31.5 percent prairie grassland and 2 percent aquatic commu­
nities.
During the botanical sampling, the archeological
crew was racing against time.
Clearing of the vegetation
in the reservoir had already begun. The vast majority of
this clearing was to be in the lowland areas dominated by
the floodplain and riparian forest communities.
The selection
of quadrats was skewed toward an increased sampling of the
most endangered communities with a resultant disproportionate
sample of floodplain and riparian forests.
At present, information on the botanical communities
represented at Palmetto Bend Reservoir is incomplete due to
the low priority of this research and to the practical neces­
sities of salvaging information about those plant associations
which were at that time in imminent danger of destruction.
General ecological or botanical interpretations will be
forthcoming in subsequent reports when data from continued
botanical sampling is available for synthesis.
The results
of this season's sampling are presented in the data appen­
dices.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTENSIVE EXCAVATION
The introduction of this report states, in general, the
criteria which were used in the selection of sites for inten­
sive excavation.
These sites fall within two main categories:
(1) relatively undisturbed sites which cannot be protected
from adverse effects by the project; and (2) endangered sites
which have been disturbed but which may provide data pertinent
to current research problems.
Although post-depositional
changes or disturbances take place at all sites, and it is
possible to understand some of the forces of change, there
are practical limits to our ability to comprehend these
dynamics.
If, for instance, l~ss than 20 percent of the
original area of a habitation site remains intact, in most
cases it would be impractical to proceed beyond limited
testing. However, a site which is in poor physical condition

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTENSIVE EXCAVATION

23

but which has historical or scientific importance, may still
be recommended for excavation.
A second set of criteria for determining which sites
are to be excavated is the size and age of the occupation.
The estimated size of a site can be stated in terms of cubic
meters of cultural fill, although this standard cannot be
readily applied to sites which are very thin and have a high
density of artifacts.
At Palmetto Bend, where cultural
residues tend to cover areas larger than 1,000 square meters
and average 25 centimeters thick, 10 cubic meters of cultural
fill was considered the minimum requirement for intensive
excavation.
Generally, sites which date to post A.D. 1900
are not of sufficient interest to warrant excavation.
Descriptive data on the sites investigated in the 1976
season is summarized in Table 1.
Sites are recommended for
intensive excavation if they meet the minimum requirements
tabulated in Table 2.
The sites which conform to these

criteria are the Northern Component of 41 JK 31, and 41 JK 33,
JK 53, JK 59, JK 66, JK 163, JK 167 and JK 178.
Two sites should be considered for their high scientific
or historic potential even though they did not meet these
minimum requirements.
Site 41 JK 74 has been badly disturbed
by the construction of a pond; however, of all the prehistoric
and historic localities examined during this phase of research,
its deposits alone retain excellently preserved faunal remains.
Site 41 JK 106, the location of the early Brackenridge home­
site, while it appears to be in poor condition, has historical
importance in the minds of the state and local populace.
Thirty-eight prehistoric and historic sites are listed
in Table 1.
Ten of these localities are recommended for
intensive excavation:
41JK 31, JK 33, JK 53, JK 57, JK 66,
JK 74, JK 106, JK 163, JK 167 and JK 178.
Two of these sites
are historic; the other eight are prehistoric.
These sites
are those which are deemed to fulfill the requisites for
practical archeological research and thus those which should
be considered in lessening the impact of the reservoir on th'e
cultural resources present.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Funding for archeological investigations at Palmetto
Bend Reservoir has been provided by the United States Bureau
of Reclamation.
There exists a relationship of friendship
between ourselves and the personnel of the Bureau of Recla­
mation's Edna field office that is rare and so special it
will be with great regret that we complete our work in the
area.
Robert J. Towles, Project Construction Engineer, has
with genuine interest followed our research in the reservoir
and whenever possible done his best to expedite it. We have
a great respect for this man; he leaves an impression of
uncommon competence.
In the city of Ganado, where we lived, we met and became
friends with the Brisbough family.
Here, too, our fortune
was good to us.
Mr. and Mrs. Brisbough, Rhonda, Rene and
Cindy are undoubtedly among the most worthwhile people in
that city.
Actually, Ganado seems to have more than its quota of
good people.
Fay Strawn of the Citizens State Bank prevented
a housing cris±s by helping us locate a home to rent. Dr. and
Mrs. Bauknight, our landlords, were understanding of the crew's
financial situation and tolerant of the strange use to which
we put their little house.
Last, but certainly of great
importance, are the Youngs who accepted us as friends and
treated us as equals despite our institutional affiliation.
Crew members during the field work included Tom Hale,
Christopher Taylor and Maureen Cavanaugh. That crew was
supplemented by a number of volunteers: Ruth and Bill Flanagan,
Ginger Hale, Margaret Taylor, Louise Jones, Bill Fawcett Sr.,
Francis Fawcett, Carl Fawcett and Ruth Harris.
Cris Taylor
remained with us after the field work and volunteered in the
processing and analysis of collections. His laughter kept
the office alive on even the worst days.
Dave Dibble, Principal Investigator for the project,
constantly kept us on our toes.
We thank Melinda Giles,
Administrative Secretary, for making sure that the project
ran smoothly on the Austin end. We would also like to thank
Dr. Dee Ann Story, Director of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, for interrupting her busy schedule in order to
discuss many of the fine points of our research.
She was often
able to find flaws in our arguments and make them plainly
visible. Dr. Story also encouraged ties with the rest of the
academic system and was influential in interesting several
students in pursuing special studies which have added greatly
to our ability t~ interpret the archeological material. We
hope in the future to involve more students in such special

research projects.
The final manuscript was edited by Margaret J. Kluge
and Solveig A. Turpin, and typed by Linda Nance.
Finally, we would like to thank Harold Beall, without
whom we might never have concluded our field work. Harold
skillfully executed the backhoe testing program he helped us
design.
The result was the recovery of samples in good
context and with small expenditure of time. Harold also
made sure that vehicles, pumps and other equipment were in
good operating order.

APPENDIX III
FAUNAL ANALYSIS OF 25 ARCHEOLOGICAL
SITES AT PALMETTO BEND RESERVOIR

Viola Hawn

46

INTRODUCTION
Twenty-five archeological sites were tested within Palmetto
Bend during the spring of 1976.
Most of these contain both
invertebrate and vertebrate remains.
The vast majority of the
material is terrestrial in origin.
A smaller amount represents
freshwater or marine components of the fauna.
The sites range
in age from Archaic to modern.
Domestic species (SU8 8arofa,
B08 taru8 and Capra SPd) suggest an age postdating European
settlement of the region for several of the sites.
Other sites
contain only native species.
The snail, Vallonia pulahella, was
found in most of the sites.
It was introduced to Texas from the
Eastern United States within historic times and may be intrusive
in some of the older sites.
The composition of the fauna is
remarkably similar from site to site.
DESCRIPTION OF THE FAUNA
PELECYPODA
Famil,Y:, Os t r

dae

Cra880strea virginiaa

common oyster

The oyster is the only marine element in the
fauna.
It grows in large colonies or banks in
shallow lagoonal water and is common on the Texas
Gulf Coast.
The shell is elongate with a rough
outer surface and a non-pearly inner surface.
The very small representation of this species
suggests lack of utilization as a food source by
the Indians.
Family

Mytilid~e

Quadrula forsheyi

fresh water mussel

This fresh water mussel is very common in
the streams of central and southern Texas.
It
is distinguished by uneven growth lines and small
tubercules on a subquadrate shell.
The inner
heliciform shape with sculptured growth lines on
the 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 surface has a white nacre.
It is found throughout the Gulf Coastal region.

Lampsilis orbiaulata

pearly fresh water mussel

This pearly fresh water mussel has a smooth
subquadrate to elongate shell.
The shell is

.,..--------------~-----

APPENDIX III

prominent growth l~nes and a brilliant
pearly white. nacre.
It is common.throughout the
eastern United,States.
u

white~with

GASTROPODA
Family Vallonidae

Vallonia puIohella

snail

This .small snail (les.s than 2 • .5'.,~.diaIlleter)
is heliciform in shape.
It is native to eastern
North America.
It has only become established
in Texas in historic times and may be intrusive
in some of the sites.
It inhabits cultivated
gardens, fields and middens with numbers as high
as thousands per aCre.
Family

Buli~~lidae

Bulimulus alternatus

snail

A fairly large (24-33'IIlm~) snail which is
bulimoid shaped.
The shell has a high apex with
6 to 7 whorls.
The shell is white or covered with
irregular gray or brown stripes.
A wide range
in shell size was referred to this species on the
assumption that the smaller shells represented
growth stages.
In other respects the characters
were the same as for the adults.
This species
is common to south Texas.

Stenotrema leai

snail

The shells of Stenotrema are a very distinctive
flat heliciform shape with sculptured growth lines
on the 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 whorls.
The shell is less
than 9 mm. in diameter.
This snail inhabits the
eastern United States and Texas.

Mesodon thyroidus

snail

Mesodon is a large (15-31 mm.) subglobose
snail with a white or ivory yellow shell.
The
5 to 5 1/2 whorls are covered with minute spiral
lines.
It is found throughout the eastern and
midwestern United States.
A wide range of sizes
were attributed to this species by characteristics
other than size.
Smaller individuals are assumed
to represent growth stages.

APPENDIX III

48

OSTEICHTHYES

Lepisosteus sp.

gar

Ten ganoid scales were collected from one
site.
These diamond shaped scales have a highly
distinctive shiny surface.
Several species of
gar are common to the streams and rivers of central
and southern Texas.
Gars can grow to lengths of
over three feet.
Fish unidentified
A few vertebrae and a spine were found in
another site, but these fragments were not identi­
fiahle to species.
The very small amount of fish
material collected from these sites suggests little
Indian utilization.
REPTILIA
Order

.~helonia

Turtle unidentified
Numerous fragments of turtle carapace were
found in four sites.
Turtles are difficult to
identify without skulls or complete carapaces.
The fragments are sufficient to determine that
they do not represent the common freshwater
soft-shelled turtle, Trionyx.
MAMMALIA
Order

Ma~supiali~

Family Didelphidae

Didelphis marsupiaZis

opossum

The opossum is the only living marsupial
native to the United States.
The opossum
is a primitive mammal, and its postcranial
bones are easily distinguished from other
mammals.
It inhabits woodlands, grassy areas
and areas along streams.

APPENDIX III

49

Order Rodentia
Family Cricetidae

Sigmodon hispidus

Hispid cotton rat

The cotton rat is a common inhabitant of
the southern United States.
A few rodent
limb bones were found in several of the sites.
Because it is difficult to identify the bones
of the numerous small rodents these remains
were not attributed to Sigmodon hispidus, the
only rodent in the fauna.
This species lives
along streams and in grassy areas.
Order Lagamorpha
Family Leporidae

Lepus oaZifornieus

black-tailed jackrabbit

The black-tailed jackrabbit is a common
inhabitant of the grassy or desert regions
of the western United States, exclusive of
the Rocky Mountains.
Its very poor represen­
tation at archeological sites is unusual, as
it is an easy and preferred prey of many
Indians.
Palmetto Bend Reservoir is in the
eastern part of the species range where the
jackrabbit is perhaps less common than in
the drier areas further west.
Order Artiodactyla
Family Suidae

Sus serofa

pig

The pig is a European domestic species
imported to the United States.
Its first
occurrence in southern Texas was in the
early part of the seventeenth century, when
Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived
in Texas.
It has been a common domestic
species in the state since that time.
The
large bunadont feeth are easily distinguished
from all other animals both domestic and wild.
Family Cervidae

OdoeoiZeus virginianus

white-tailed deer

The white-tailed deer is common throughout
the United States, exclusive of the southwestern

APPENDIX III

50

deserts.
It is smaller than the closely related
mule deer, OdocoiZeua hemionua, which lives further
north and west.
The white-tailed deer inhabits
forests and open brushy areas.
Family Bovidae
BOB

tarus

cow

Cattle were first brought to Texas in the
early seventeenth century by the Spanish.
The
few elements and teeth found in the sites around
Palmetto Bend were not of remarkable size and it
was not possible to identify them as Bison bison.
Bison were found in Texas but the range was mainly
further west and north of the Palmetto Bend
Reservoir sites. Unless horn cores or skull
bones which can be identified as Eison are found,
it is best to rely on associated materials within
a site.
In several sites Bos is associated with
other clearly identified domestic species.
One
limb bone attributed to Bos was cut crossways at
both ends with a metal saw.

Capra sp.

goat

The goat is also a European domestic species.
It has been in Texas since the early seventeenth
century.
The single tooth found is larger than
that of the white-tailed deer, and is very
distinctive.
FAUNAL ANALYSIS BY SITE
Table 1 lists all the sites and the identified faunal
material from each.
Six of the sites contain no identifiable
faunal material.
These are sites 4lJK54, 4lJK60, 4lJK65, 4lJK167,
4lJK170 and 4lJK172.
Sites 4lJK36, 4lJK52, 4lJK55, 4lJK58,
4lJK59, 4lJK68, 4lJK74, 4lJK75, 41JK163, 4lJK165, 4lJK177 and
4lJK178.contain one or more species native to Texas.
The remain­
ing sites contain one or more domestic species.
On the basis of
the domestic species, it is possible to establish a modern age
for these sites:
4lJK3l, 4lJK33, 4lJK53, 4lJK66, 41JKl06,
4lJK162 and 4lJK175.
NumbE!rs of individuals for the inverte­
brates are included in Table 10. Minimum numbers of individuals
per ~iteare given in Table 11.·
Biomass data is not particularly reliable unless a large
sample is used, as the range of weight for mast animals is great.
Male and female average weights differ by as much as 100 percent.
A rough estimate of biomass can be obtained by multiplying the
minimum number of individuals by an average weight for each
species and summing the weights.
Because of the small size of

APPENDIX III

51

the sample and the few individuals of a species per site the
total mammalian biomass is estimated in Table 12.
GONCLUSIONS
The small sample sizes from most of the sites at the Palmetto
Bend Reservoir is insufficient to make any conclusions concerning
the fauna or the age.
Earlier reports on the sites (McGuff 1978)
suggested a great amount of fish material from the sites.
This,
however, was not true of the sample collections analyzed.
Domestic
species account for 80 percent of the total mammalian biomass
from all sites, even though domestic species were found in only
seven of the twenty-five sites.
Invertebrates were found in
eighteen sites and vertebrates in twenty-one sites. Distribution
of the invertebrates appears to be random through sites containing
both wild and domestic mammal species.
The snail, Vallonia
pulchella, was found in all sites with any appreciable amount of
faunal material.
Its presence may indicate a modern age for
the sites or it may be intrusive in sites predating the European
colonization of Texas.
The lack of small material, rodent bones and teeth at an
archeological site is usually due to the screening method used
in collecting the material rather than their absence from the
site.
It requires a very fine mesh screen to catch the tiny
teeth of the common native rodents of southern Texas.
Small
rodents often have highly restricted climatic requirements and
