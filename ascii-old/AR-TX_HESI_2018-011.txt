MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Berg-Oliver Associates,
Inc. (BOA), on behalf of the Sweeny Hospital District, to conduct a cultural resources inventory
survey and assessment for the proposed development of an approximately 11.6-hectare (28.7acre) tract in Sweeny, Brazoria County, Texas. The proposed tract consists of a largely
undeveloped, lightly wooded parcel bounded on the north by County Road (CR) 524 (a.k.a. Main
Street) and on the south by Stevenson Slough. The proposed project would involve the
construction of a new hospital that represents a single-site replacement facility for an existing
community hospital. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for direct effects consists of the entire
11.6-hectare (28.7-acre) tract within which construction would occur, and the APE for indirect
effects would include an assessment of possible viewshed impacts to any historic-age buildings
(i.e., 50 years of age or older) on parcels adjacent to the construction site.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the Sweeny Hospital District, a political
subdivision of the state of Texas; as such, the proposed project falls under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). In addition, the project
would utilize funding provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA); consequently, the
project also falls under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. As the proposed project represents a publicly sponsored
undertaking, the project sponsor is required to provide the lead federal agency and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for
the state of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on the project’s potential to
adversely affect historic properties listed on or considered eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under the NHPA and/or for designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
On August 9, 2017 and April 9, 2018, Horizon Project Archeologists Briana Smith and
Charles E. Bludau, Jr., under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator,
performed an intensive archeological survey of the APE for direct effects to locate any
archeological resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
Horizon’s archeologists traversed the tract and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface
for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The APE is located on a gentle, south-facing
coastal upland flat adjacent to Stevenson Slough that ultimately discharges into the San Bernard
River. The tract is undeveloped, and vegetation consists largely of ankle- to knee-high grasses

with scattered oak trees, with dense stands of palmettos lining the banks of the slough to the
south. The tract appears to have been used primarily as a cattle pasture in the recent past, though
it may also have been used as cropland at one time.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 0.8 hectare (2.0 acres) for project
areas between 4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11.0 and 100.0 acres) in size; as such, a total of 14 shovel
tests would be required within the 11.6-hectare (28.7-acre) APE for direct effects. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 16 shovel tests. The pedestrian survey and
shovel testing revealed that sediments in the APE consist of deep silty loam or loam overlying
silty clay at average depths of 60.0 to 80.0 centimeters (23.6 to 31.5 inches) below surface in the
southern portion of the tract near the slough. Sediments in the northern portion of the tract were
shallower, consisting mainly of silty clay loam or clay loam overlying clay or compact silty clay at
a depth of approximately 40.0 centimeters (15.7 inches) below surface. Shovel testing was
capable of fully penetrating Holocene-age sediments with the potential to contain archeological
deposits. No archeological resources, prehistoric or historic-age, were observed on the modern
ground surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated during the survey of the APE for direct
effects. The archeological survey has been conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8134.
On August 8, 2017, Horizon historian Eugene Foster conducted a reconnaissance-level
historical resources inventory survey of the APE for indirect effects. The reconnaissance-level
survey was conducted to identify NRHP-listed and NRHP-eligible historic properties that may be
affected by the proposed undertaking. The APE for non-archeological resources included the
project tract as well as all adjoining property parcels. Eleven historic-age resources (i.e., 50 years
of age or older) were recorded within the APE for indirect effects, though no historic-age resources
are present within the APE for direct effects. The 11 historical resources include two
commercial/industrial buildings and nine single-family residences constructed between 1950 and
1967. All of the 11 historical resources within the APE, individually and as a group, are
recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations of the APE documented in this
report, no potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking.
In accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable
and good-faith effort to identify historic properties within the APE. No cultural resources were
identified that meet the criteria for inclusion in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for
designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26, and no further archeological investigations or
historical research are recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, it
should be noted that human burials are protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In
the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the APE, even in previously surveyed areas,
all work should cease immediately at the location of the inadvertent discovery until a qualified
archeologist can assess the find, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The APE is located in Brazoria County on the Gulf Coastal Plain in southeastern Texas.
The Gulf of Mexico represents a structural basin formed by lithosphere deformation. The Texas
Coastal Plain, which extends as far north as the Ouachita uplift in southern Oklahoma and
westward to the Balcones Escarpment in central Texas, consists of seaward-dipping bodies of
sedimentary rock, most of which are of terrigenous clastic origin, that reflect the gradual infilling
of the basin from its margins (Abbott 2001). The Houston area is underlain by rocks and
unconsolidated sediments that are quite young in a geological sense, ranging from modern to
Miocene in age. These consist predominantly of a series of fluviodeltaic bodies arranged in an
offlapped sequence, with interdigitated and capping eolian, littoral, and estuarine facies making
up a relatively minor component of the lithology. Major bounding disconformities between these
formations are usually interpreted to represent depositional hiatuses that occurred during periods
of sea level low stand. The oldest rocks in this fill are of Late Cretaceous age. As a result of the
geometry of basin filling, successively younger rock units crop out in subparallel bands from the
basin margin toward the modern coastline.
The APE is situated on a coastal flat overlooking Stevenson Slough that forms the
southern margin of the APE. Local topography slopes down gently to the south, averaging
approximately 10.7 meters (35.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl).

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The APE is underlain by Holocene-age alluvium (Qal), which consists of varying quantities
of clay, silt, sand, and organic matter that form point bars, natural levees, stream channels,
backswamps, coastal marshes, mud flats, and narrow beach deposits (Fisher 1982). The
landform on which the APE is situated is composed of a mosaic of loamy and clayey alluvium
ranging of Holocene and general Quaternary (NRCS 2017) (Figure 3; Table 1).

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from

the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was considerably
cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was more heavily
forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late
Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying
trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by
grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period,
the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable. The deciduous forests
had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming
trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there
appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to
5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental
conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
The modern climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild
winters. The climate is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of
Mexico, but it is modified by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate
throughout spring, summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide
a continental climate characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
In winter, the average temperature is 52 degrees Fahrenheit (°F); however, during winter
the temperature tends to fluctuate greatly as air masses move in and out of the area. These air
masses can produce light rain and drizzle, and conditions can become cloudy. Spring is relatively
dry, with some thunderstorms and cool spells. Summer temperatures are high, with the daily

maximum temperature often reaching or exceeding 90°F. Fall is warm, dry, and pleasant, with
increasing cold spells.
The average precipitation within the region is 127.0 centimeters (50.0 inches). The
majority of this precipitation occurs as rain that falls between April and September. The growing
season is approximately 265 days long.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

Brazoria County is situated near the southeastern edge of the Texan biotic province (Blair
1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces
and the grasslands of the Kansas, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach
the limits of their ecological range within the Texas province. McMahan et al. (1984) further define
four broad communities that characterize that portion of the Texan biotic province that lies on the
Gulf Coastal Plain: (1) coastal marsh/barrier island, (2) coastal prairie, (3) coastal gallery forest,
and (4) pine-hardwood forest (cf. Abbott 2001:24-26).
The coastal marsh/barrier island category includes well-drained, sandy, coastal
environments and saline and freshwater wetlands in the coastal zone (Abbott 2001:24). Marsh
vegetation is typical of areas that are seasonally wet and have substrates composed primarily of
sands and silts, clays, or organic decomposition products. Vegetation assemblages are strongly
controlled by texture, salinity, frequency and duration of inundation, and depth of the seasonal
water table. Sandy, relatively well-drained, freshwater environments are typically dominated by
little bluestem, switchgrass, Florida paspalum, and brownseed paspalum. Wetter environments
are often dominated by marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, saggitaria, bulrushes, smooth
cordgrass, seashore paspalum, seashore dropseed, olney bulrush, saltmarsh bulrush, saltmarsh
aster, longtom, sprangletop, burhead, arrowhead, coastal waterhyssop, needlegrass rush, and
other sedges and rushes. Slightly higher, better-drained environments are characterized by taxa
like seashore saltgrass, seashore paspalum, gulfdune paspalum, shoregrass, gulf cordgrass, red
lovegrass, bushy sea-oxey, and glasswort. A variety of fauna are characteristic of the shore zone.
Important larger taxa include raccoon, nutria, alligators, turtles, swamp rabbit, and many birds,
including ducks, geese, herons, and many smaller species. Aquatic taxa, including a wealth of
fish and shellfish adapted to brackish to hypersaline conditions, are also important in the coastal
zone.
The coastal prairie category consists primarily of grasses with minor amounts of forbs and
woody plants in areas that are not saturated on a seasonal basis (Abbott 2001:24-26). This
community is characteristic of upland areas and grades into the pine-hardwood forest to the north
and east and into the coastal marsh/barrier island to the south. A wide variety of grasses are
found in the prairie environments, but the principal taxa include big bluestem, little bluestem,
indiangrass, eastern grama, switchgrass, brownseed paspalum, sideoats grama, silver bluestem,
buffalograss, threeawn, and Texas wintergrass. Common forbs include Maximilian sunflower,
Engelman daisy, blacksalmon, penstemon, dotted gayfeather, bundleflower, yellow neptunia,
snoutbean, prairie clover, tickclover, wildbean, western indigo, paintbrush, bluebonnet, ragweed,
croton, milkweed, vetch, verbena, and winecup. Woody plants occurring in the coastal prairie
include mesquite, honey locust, huisache, eastern baccharis, sesbania, live oak, elm, hackberry,

bumelia, and coralberry. The frequency of trees increases dramatically as the coastal prairie
grades into the pine-hardwood forest, forming an open woodland environment with common
stands of hardwood trees and occasional pines. The coastal prairie is home to a diverse fauna,
including coyote, white-tailed deer, skunks, cottontail rabbit, many small rodents, amphibians and
reptiles, and a variety of permanent and migratory birds. Bison and pronghorn were also present
at various times in the past.
The coastal gallery forest consists of diverse, principally deciduous, trees and associated
understory in floodplains and streams that traverse the outer coastal plain (Abbott 2001:26).
Important taxa include water oak, pecan, poplar, American elm, cedar elm, sugarberry, ash,
loblolly pine, water oak, post oak, cherrybark oak, mulberry, swamp chestnut oak, willow oak,
sweetgum, hawthorn, dogwood, hickory, bois d’arc, sassafras cypress, willow, cottonwood, and
sumac. Shrubs and vines such as mustang grape, greenbrier, yaupon, coralberry, possumhaw,
elderberry, honeysuckle, dewberry, and blackberry are common in the understory, as are grasses
such as little bluestem, big bluestem, and indiangrass. The fauna of the gallery forest include
white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, turkey, a variety of small mammals and rodents,
turtles, snakes, and many birds. Black bear was also present at various times in the past, and a
number of fish and a few varieties of shellfish are present in the streams.
The pine-hardwood forest is characterized by a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees,
including longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, post oak, red oak, white oak, blackjack oak,
willow oak, and live oak (Abbott 2001:26). Riparian environments often support larger deciduous
trees like pecan, cottonwood, hickory, beech, and American elm. Understory vegetation varies
from relatively open to quite dense, and consists of shrubs, vines, forbs, and young trees.
Common shrubs include acacia, yaupon, mayhaw, wild persimmon, myrtle, greenbrier, Virginia
creeper, blackberry, dewberry, trumpet vine, gourd, and poison ivy. A variety of fauna is also
present, including white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit, mink, skunk, various small
rodents, turtles, reptiles, and many different birds. Black bear was also present at times in the
past, and bison and pronghorn were occasionally present in the transition zone to the coastal
prairie environment.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The APE is located within the Southeast Texas archeological region. In broad terms,
much of the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between the
Southern Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995; Story
1990). Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of
Southeast Texas. These two subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the inland
subregion has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast Texas
comprises a zone about 25.7 kilometers (16.0 miles) inland from the coast that covers the area
influenced by Gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable ecological
variability characterizes this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes, wetlands,
marine coastline, and barrier islands. The inland subregion also encompasses considerable
ecological diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney woods.
In discussions of the prehistory of Texas, Brazoria County is often treated as part of a
cultural transition zone. Following Patterson (1995), Southeast Texas is defined as a 21-county
area (including Brazoria County) that lies between the Colorado River on the west and the Sabine
River on the east, extending about 199.5 kilometers (124.0 miles) inland from the coastline.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to denote
Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural characteristics of
Southeast Texas culture periods are often different than in neighboring regions. For instance, the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and Southeast Texas, and
Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time in
Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit evidence of
reoccupation through time, have well defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be associated
with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of subsistence-related
activities. Inland sites tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired clay balls (at some
sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites tend to consist of
multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain few lithics, oyster shell tools, large quantities
of pottery (in later cultural components), and numerous bone tools.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5,000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5,000 B.C.) (Patterson 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas are
known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of
plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little
evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in
North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced
during all prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable
differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early PaleoIndian period
(10,000 to 8,000 B.C.), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points (i.e., Clovis,
Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period (8,000 to
5,000 B.C.), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5,000 B.C. TO A.D. 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signals the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5,000 B.C. to A.D. 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a
significant reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more

12

Archeological and Historical Investigations of the Proposed
28.7-acre Sweeny Hospital Tract, Sweeny, Brazoria County, Texas

diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. In
Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5,000 to 3,000 B.C.) is marked by the presence of
Bell, Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The
Bell point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains. Many
of the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3,000 to 1,500 B.C.) and several
new types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and probably the
Gary-Kent series. The Late Archaic period (1,500 B.C. to A.D. 100) is characterized by Gary,
Kent, Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition developed
in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981; Patterson
1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period, but reached
full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as boatstones and
bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang knives, stingray
spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial practices included the
systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre, and use of locally made
grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most burials are found in extended
supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials are also known. Burial direction
is usually consistent within single sites, but varies from site to site. Patterson et al. (1993) report
that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton
counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (A.D. 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 B.C., in the Galveston Bay area by
about A.D. 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about A.D. 300, and in the ConroeLivingston inland area by about A.D. 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears to have
progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995). Southeastern
Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where Aten (1983)
established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area
128.7 kilometers (80.0 miles) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal

HJN 170157 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

exception of a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found
on the Gulf coast west of the Sabine Lake area.
Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and the early part of the Historic periods (Aten
1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility ware
throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown Plain for
about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods before
once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety, Goose
Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor pottery
types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway (Aten
1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte types
are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste (like
Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period, but, as already discussed, ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas. Along
the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e., spearthrower) and spear was
generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though they continued to be used in the
inland subregion along with the bow and arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Ensor and
Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In fact, Patterson
(1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in Southeast Texas as early as the
end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points that consisted of marginally
retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a generalized date of adoption of the bowand-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca. A.D. 600) in Central and Southeast Texas.
In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade
technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. A serial
sequence for these point types has not been established in Southeast Texas, though Scallorn
points appear to predate Perdiz points throughout the rest of Texas.
Grog- (crushed sherd) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric
periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto Plain and Baytown
Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small proportion of smallsized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that are often visible on
vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek pottery remained in use
throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt Coated pottery from the
Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in Southeast Texas during the Late
Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, protohistoric and early historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have not
been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and historic population movements further complicate this issue. Aten (1983) has reconstructed
the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century, including the
Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco (Karankawa?), and Tonkawa. The presence of the Tonkawa in
Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central Texas in the 17th and
18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought to have occupied the
coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the corresponding mainland
(Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east of the San Bernard River,
the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the historic periods
(Patterson 1993; 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in identifying historic
Indian sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and possibly Fresno and
Cuney points after A.D. 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites are usually identified
by the presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1700 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Alonso
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near
Galveston Bay. However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where
the burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time
that heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous
Indian population was greatly diminished. The Alabama-Coushatta Indians who currently reside
in Southeast Texas are migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early 19th
centuries (Newcomb 1961).
Though the alluvial bottomlands of the county’s rivers attracted settlement by AngloAmericans as early as 1820, the passengers of the schooner Lively who landed at the mouth of
the Brazos River in December 1821 passed on to Richmond.1 The area was first populated when
Stephen F. Austin selected it for his proposed settlement, and 89 of Austin’s Old Three Hundred
had grants in what is now Brazoria County by 1824. The earliest communities were Velasco (at
the site of present Surfside), East Columbia (originally known as Bell’s Landing or Marion),

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Columbia (later West Columbia), and Brazoria. Quintana and Liverpool were also settled before
1832.
Anglo-American Settlement and Agriculture in Brazoria County (1832 to Present)
Brazoria County became part of the Victoria district when Austin’s original San Felipe
district was divided in two in 1826. In 1832, the legislature of Coahuila separated Brazoria
Municipality from San Felipe and made Brazoria its capital. Brazoria Municipality was the scene
of the Battle of Velasco on June 26, 1832, and witnessed other agitation against Mexican rule. In
1833, county residents suffered both flood and cholera, but in 1834 population in the municipality
reached 2,100, and prosperity returned. A decision was made to change the name of the
municipality from Brazoria to Columbia, to make Columbia the seat of government, and transfer
some territory to Matagorda Municipality. At the time, the largest settlements in the future county
were Brazoria with 500 residents, Velasco with 100, and Bolivar with 50. As early as the mid1830s, cotton farms produced more than 5,000 bales annually, and plantation owners in the area
became some of the wealthiest in Texas. On March 1, 1835, a meeting near Brazoria led to the
establishment of the first Masonic lodge in Texas—Holland Lodge No. 36.
When Stephen F. Austin declared against Santa Anna at another meeting in Brazoria on
September 8, 1835, Texans began to prepare for a revolution. Agitation for independence led to
the formation of committees of public safety and public meetings to discuss the impending break.
After the convention at San Felipe and engagements at Gonzales, Goliad, and Bexar, volunteer
companies were organized and a provisional government approved on November 13, 1835.
Henry Smith of Brazoria County served as the first provisional governor. Formation of a
permanent council soon thereafter brought the inauguration of mail routes throughout the area.
Rebellion grew in 1835 and 1836, culminating in the Texas Declaration of Independence.
Citizens of the county contributed men and means to the Texas Revolution and
participated in the Runaway Scrape. After his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21,
1836, Santa Anna and members of his army were taken to Velasco, then the location of the
provisional government. Here Santa Anna signed the Treaties of Velasco with the Republic of
Texas on May 14, 1836. Columbia, the seat of the interim government, served as the capital of
the republic when sessions of the first Texas Congress met in October 1836. During the first
session, Stephen F. Austin died and was buried at Peach Point. Houston became the capital.
Under the provisional government, Texas accepted the constitution that made its first
counties from former municipalities. Brazoria County, among the first, took its name from the
Brazos River when the Congress of the republic established it on March 24, 1836. Brazoria,
which became county seat when the county was organized on December 20, 1836, served until
1896, when Angleton replaced it. The establishment of Fort Bend County in 1837 and of
Galveston County in 1838 drew the present-day county boundaries, and the towns of Columbia,
Velasco, and Brazoria were incorporated by the Congress of the republic in 1837.
According to some sources, the last shipment of African-Americans brought as slaves into
North America arrived at the mouth of the San Bernard River in 1840. At that time, the community
of Brazoria had an estimated population of 800 and Columbia of 300; 80 slaveholders in the

16

county owned a total of 1,316 slaves. Yellow fever and flooding in 1843 and 1844 slowed growth,
but the annexation of Texas to the United States in 1845 and the Mexican War had little effect on
residents of Brazoria County, who were mostly farmers. By 1847, Brazoria County had 1,623
white inhabitants and 3,013 slaves. In 1852, the county produced 7,329 hogsheads of sugar, the
most of all Texas counties.
During pioneer days, the Brazos River was the chief artery by which immigration,
communication, and commerce penetrated Texas from the Gulf. Small boats regularly navigated
as far as East Columbia, and customhouses were located at Brazoria and Velasco. By 1840,
Buffalo Bayou and the growing town of Houston had begun to draw commerce away from the
Brazos, but freight and passenger service between Brazoria, other Brazos River ports, and
Galveston was established by 1842, and a canal from the Brazos mouth to West Galveston Bay
was completed by 1857.
Between 1849 and 1859, plantation life in Brazoria County flourished, and the county
became the wealthiest in Texas, with a typically Southern society based on slavery. Agriculture
was the foundation of the county’s early economy, and some of the state’s largest and most
prosperous sugar and cotton plantations grew up along the rivers and deeper creeks on which
crops could be shipped by barges. Plantations in the county between 1850 and 1860 numbered
46, including 19 sugar, 16 cotton, and 3 that produced both sugar and cotton. Before the war,
these plantations produced an average of 7,000 to 8,000 hogsheads of sugar annually, and up to
three-fourths of the state’s output in 1857. Many planters raised cattle, and some cultivated
oranges, lemons, and other fruits. Twenty-six county residents owned more than $100,000 in
property by the year 1860; the foremost planter was John H. Herndon, whose real property was
valued at more than $1.6 million and personal property at more than $106,000. In that year,
Brazoria County had 2,027 white, 5,110 black slave, and six free black residents; by 1864, when
slaves numbered 5,125, their value was only slightly less than the county’s 283,151 acres of land.
Town life was subordinated to plantation life, and Old Velasco and Quintana served as Gulf
seaports and resort centers for antebellum plantation society. Later, the two towns declined in
importance as plans for an intracoastal canal to divert trade developed, and in 1875 and 1900
both were almost destroyed by hurricanes. Other transportation in the period was provided by
the Houston Tap and Brazoria Railroad, chartered in 1856 and built by planters to connect East
Columbia with Houston markets and with the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railroad at
Pierce Junction. After the Civil War, this railroad became the property of the International-Great
Northern.
Residents of Brazoria County cast more than 99% of their votes for secession, 527 for
and two against. During the Civil War, the Dance Brothers gun works manufactured weapons,
companies were organized for the Confederate Army, and women were left to run the plantations.
Fortifications built at Velasco and Quintana weathered Union attacks in 1862. Confederate
blockade runners operated along the coast, and some cotton was shipped overland by mule and
wagon to Mexico. Though the county suffered little physical damage in the war, the presence of
federal troops and loss of profit from cotton crops in 1864 brought increasing hardship. Some
plantations were destroyed, and agricultural production declined sharply with the freeing of the
slaves. David G. Mills alone lost 313 slaves as a result of emancipation. County land was valued

HJN 170157 AR

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

at more than $3 million in 1860, but its value had declined to less than $2 million by 1866. During
the same period, total property value in the county fell from almost $7 million to less than
$3 million. Many plantations were divided into smaller farms or turned into pastures; others
eventually became part of the Ramsey, Retrieve, Clemens, and Darrington state prison farms. In
1870, only a single Brazoria County resident, farmer William Bryan, had a prewar level of wealth,
with real property valued at $100,000 and personal property worth $20,000. As conditions
worsened, some Brazoria County citizens moved to Mexico, where they organized settlements in
the Tuxpan River valley in Vera Cruz.
Between 1870 and 1880, the population in Brazoria County grew from 7,527 to 9,774,
largely due to the arrival of federal soldiers and other Northerners, foreign immigrants, and
Confederate soldiers from Texas and the Old South. S.A. Hackworth, a white Republican, bought
land in Wharton, Fort Bend, and Brazoria counties and sold it to blacks in the 1870s and 1880s.
By the 1890s, Columbia was the largest town in the county, followed by Brazoria, Velasco,
Quintana, Sandy Point, and Liverpool, and new towns had been founded—Alvin, Angleton, and
Pearland. In 1898, at the end of the Spanish-American War, Adm. George Dewey acquired
65,000 acres of land in Brazoria County.
Economic recovery came slowly in the post-Civil War era. The principal crops were corn,
grains, sweet and Irish potatoes, fruits, wild grapes, and cotton and sugar for export. Sugar
production, reduced in the early years of Reconstruction, burgeoned with the use of convict labor
by 1871, but never again reached earlier levels. By 1867, the value of livestock, chiefly cattle,
nearly equaled that of agriculture. When cattlemen found northern markets shut off in the late
1860s, hide and tallow factories were established along the Brazos River; Brazoria County packed
$100,000 worth of canned beef in 1870. Figs were introduced in the Alvin area around the turn
of the century and became an important crop. Four canneries were later built in the community.
Live oak moss was ginned at Angleton.
Though the Galveston and Brazos Navigation Company was chartered as early as 1850,
major improvements in transportation began only in the 1870s, starting with a canal across
Galveston Bay, completed with the help of the federal government. By 1905, workers completed
jetties to deepen the water in the harbors at Velasco and Quintana, and in part of what became
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The Brazos River Harbor Association was founded in 1925, and
by 1929 Brazos River diversion reduced the problem of sanding in the channel and opened the
harbor at Freeport. Railroad transportation improved. The Houston and Brazos Valley Railroad
reached Velasco by 1907, the Sugar Land Railroad was serving plantations along Oyster Creek
by 1916, and the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway established service to Brazoria by
1937. All were later acquired by the Missouri Pacific system, and more recently by the Union
Pacific. Major state highway construction in the county was done in the 1920s and 1930s, though
State Highway (SH) 288 was not completed until later.
The value of Brazoria County agriculture rose steadily after Reconstruction, and the
majority of residents earned their livelihood from the soil until the late 1930s. The use of mules
declined with widespread use of tractors after 1925, and the number of farms increased steadily
to a maximum of 3,065 in 1940. Houston Lighting and Power service reached the county in 1927;
however, by 1930, the effects of the Great Depression were obvious. Whereas fewer than a third
18

170157_arch_survey_report

Archeological and Historical Investigations of the Proposed
28.7-acre Sweeny Hospital Tract, Sweeny, Brazoria County, Texas

of county farmers were tenants in 1880, by 1930 tenants constituted a majority, a condition that
lasted until the 1950s. Between 1900 and 1930, Brazoria County was described as a cattleraising area, with some oil and sulfur production, dairying, and diverse farming. The dairy
industry, centered on Alvin, peaked between 1910 and 1930, and cotton culture in 1920. Corn
culture concentrated near Sweeny, Brazoria, Damon, Danbury, and Angleton; stock farming
around Alvin’ truck farming in the Sweeny area; figs and poultry near Alvin and Angleton; and
pecans around Sweeny and East Columbia.
Rice culture enhanced the economy. Farmers near Danbury and elsewhere started
planting rice after 1900 and began to dig rice canals in 1935. From a total of 6,000 acres planted
in the crop in 1903, planting grew to 16,000 acres by 1940. In 1948, favorable growing conditions
made Brazoria County the nation’s number-one rice producing area, with a crop valued at more
than $10 million. The average yield per acre almost doubled between 1956 and 1970; an average
of 53,000 acres was planted during those years. Rice and grain exports comprised 65,000 tons
in 1968; American Rice, Inc., at Brazosport, shipped 350,000 tons of rice in 1990.
Brazoria County mineral development began at West Columbia oilfield as early as 1901.
Oil production started at Brazoria in 1902, reached 12,500,000 barrels in 1921, declined during
the depression, and then resumed. Brazoria County ranked fourth among Texas counties in
1946, with 29,308,106 barrels produced. Sulfur deposits at Bryan Mound, Hoskins Mound, and
Stratton Ridge Dome were first mined in 1912, and soon made the county first in US production
of sulfur. The Freeport Sulphur Company employed 800 persons at Bryan and Hoskins Mound
in 1930 and extracted 2,000 tons of sulfur daily. By 1944, the firm had extracted 552,000 long
tons of ore. The county’s contribution to World War I came from factories at Brazoria, Sweeny,
and Hasima that produced live oak nails for shipbuilding.
Brazoria County manufacturing was relatively unimportant as late as 1940, when it
employed only 166 persons. During the 1940s, however, the number of manufacturing jobs
increased rapidly. As the depletion of Bryan Mound sulfur deposits brought an end to the area’s
principal industry, Dow Chemical Company, drawn to natural resources at Freeport, came in 1939
and soon gave rise to the Brazosport industrial and port community. After the Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor in 1941, members of the Texas National Guard manned newly established Dow
facilities, while the company constructed 2,300 dwelling units in less than two months for its
workers. By 1945, exports from Brazosport amounted to 117,610 tons. Another effect of World
War II on the county took the form of camps for prisoners of war, which housed German soldiers
and members of Rommel’s Afrika Corps for a time. A second phase of industrialization began in
the 1950s as “customer companies,” including Monsanto and processors of chemical fertilizers,
established operations nearby to make use of Dow products. Industrial development attracted
more workers, including people from East Texas and some African Americans from nearby
communities, while real estate developments produced such new Brazosport communities as
Lake Jackson. Transportation, meanwhile, included by 1949 the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe
Railway and the Missouri Pacific, which operated the Houston and Brazos Valley; the St. Louis,
Brownsville, and Mexico; the International-Great Northern; and the Texas and New Orleans. The
county population grew from 27,069 in 1940 to 46,413 in 1950 and continued to expand. By 1982,

HJN 170157 AR

19

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

at which time 17,800 persons were employed in 2,785 business establishments in Brazoria
County, three decades of further growth had more than tripled the population to 185,244.
Small farms in Brazoria County increased through the 1930s and 1940s, and farmers
increasingly raised crops as tenants rather than landowners. By 1945, agribusiness had
appeared; fewer than 7% of all farms accounted for almost 70% of farm income, and more than
50% of farms made less than $1,000 annually. At the same time, the county ranked eighth in
Texas cattle production, with 69,437 head, and farmers turned to the Brahman breed. Overall
farm production peaked in the 1950s, with 130,000 acres of cropland harvested. County farmers
owned almost 82,000 cattle by 1960, and by 1968 cattle outnumbered people. Roughly 60% of
the county’s agricultural income derived from rice in the 1970s, and 40% from livestock and
poultry; cotton, soybeans, and grain increased in importance by the latter part of the decade. By
1976, the county had 48 oil and gas fields, including Old Ocean, Chocolate Bayou, Damon Mound,
Hastings, Bryan Mound, Danbury, Manvel, and West Columbia. In the late 20th century,
petroleum and mineral production and marketing, together with other extraction and
manufacturing and the chemical industry, continued to shape the county’s development and the
lives of local farmers and ranchers. More than 2,549,000 barrels of oil and 44,831,552 cubic feet
of gas-well gas were produced in the county in 2004; by the end of that year, 1,270,790,962
barrels of oil had been taken from county lands since 1902. Magnesium from sea water, which
ranked Brazoria County first in the nation’s production, along with oyster shell, sulfur, and salt,
was manufactured at Freeport and Velasco. The shrimping industry grew at Freeport after World
War II. In 1967, 610 boats harvested 14,000,000 pounds of shrimp; the 1971 catch was 160 times
larger than that in 1970, and the harvest doubled again by 1972. Both fishing and the recreation
industry, which grew up after 1960, fostered ongoing development on the Gulf Coast.
By the 1980s, the county had 186 manufacturing establishments that employed almost
18,000 workers. In the 1990s, when the county had more than 41,000 acres of rice in production,
the chief agricultural products were rice, cattle, cotton, corn, small grains, forage, and truck crops,
with some sorghum, soybeans, and horses. The Brazoria-Galveston Soil Conservation District
promoted adequate drainage to allow cultivation.
The population of Brazoria County became more homogeneous during the 20th century.
After 1900, the white population grew steadily. By 1920, as blacks began to leave for employment
in northern cities, the county had twice as many white as black residents. A typical county resident
at the turn of the century was born either in the lower South or within the state of Texas. Native
whites comprised 62.9% of the total population in 1930, and grew to 71.4% in 1940. Mexican
Americans increased in the 1930s, especially around Alvin, where they were employed as farm
laborers. The county population, 23,114 in 1930, increased steadily but predominantly in urban
areas after 1940, and rose almost 57% between 1970 and 1980. Of a total population of 182,244
in 1982, almost 68% were native Texans, 13,152 were African American, and 22,679 Hispanic.
Brazoria County’s first school was established in 1827, Brazoria Academy in 1839, Alvin
Normal School in 1890, and the University of South Texas in 1897. By 1900, eight independent
school districts with 200 teachers and 40 school buildings served the county’s 6,000 pupils. Alvin
Community College, founded in the late 1940s, enrolled 3,900 students in 1990. Brazosport
College began in 1968. Common-school districts expanded significantly around 1920 and

suffered declining enrollments during the Great Depression, but grew again by 1940 as the
northern county population increased with the rapid growth of Houston, and the southern and
central parts of the county grew through the influence of increasing industrialization. New
independent school districts became necessary. In 1935, the county had 27 schools for whites
and 28 for blacks, and in 1940 Pearland had the only first-class high school among the commonschool districts. In 1950, only 23% of the county population had completed high school, but by
1982 more than 65% had done so. College graduates numbered almost 14% that year.
In 2000, the census counted 241,767 people living in Brazoria County. About 66% were
Anglo, 23% were Hispanic, and 9% were African American. Almost 80% of residents age 25 and
older had four years of high school, and more than 19% had college degrees. In the early
21st century, petroleum and chemical production, tourism, and agribusiness were the key
elements of the area’s economy. In 2002, the county had 2,455 farms and ranches covering
613,891 acres, 55% of which were devoted to pasture, 37% to crops, and 7% to woodlands. In
that year, local farmers and ranchers earned $47,422,000, with crop sales accounting for
$24,824,000 of that total. Cattle, hay, rice, beans, sorghum, nursery plants, corn, and cotton were
the chief agricultural products. Over 19,271,000 cubic feet of pinewood and over 3,680,000 cubic
feet of hardwood were harvested in the county in 2003.
Angleton (2000 population, 18,130) is the county’s seat of government and Pearland
(37,640) its largest city. Brazosport (59,440) is a community of nine cities, including Brazoria,
Clute, Freeport, Jones Creek, Lake Jackson, Oyster Creek, Quintana, Richwood, and Surfside
Beach. Other towns include West Columbia (4,255), Sweeny (3,624), Manvel (3,046), Brookside
Village (1,960), Danbury (1,611), Holiday Lakes (1,095), Bailey’s Prairie (694), Damon (535),
Danciger (357), and Bonney (384). Brazoria County offers water sports, fishing, hunting, and
other recreation, along with historic sites including Varner-Hogg Plantation State Historical Park.
The county celebrates a San Jacinto Festival at West Columbia and the Spring Fling at Clute in
April; a Mexican Fiesta at Pearland and Youth Rodeo and Frontier Days at Alvin in May; a Fishing
Fiesta at Freeport, a Fireworks Display at Alvin, and the Great Texas Mosquito Festival and
Parade at Clute in July; a Founders Day Celebration at Pearland in September; and a County
Fair and Rodeo at Angleton and the Bluegrass and Gospel Fall Festival at Brazoria in October.
Mineral Extraction and Manufacturing in Brazoria County (1901 to 1972)

Oil and Natural Gas
The APE is located within the Old Ocean Oil Field, one of several discovered in Brazoria
County following the initial discovery of oil at West Columbia in 1901. Oil production started at
Brazoria in 1902, reached 12,500,000 barrels in 1921, declined during the Depression, and then
resumed following the discovery of oil at Old Ocean by J.S. Abercrombie in 1934 and the further
discovery of natural gas at Old Ocean in 1936. Brazoria County ranked fourth among Texas
counties in 1946, with 29,308,106 barrels produced. The Old Ocean field has been characterized
by engineers as “one of the most unusual and complex fields” in Texas because it was unitized
in 1948. The unitization of the field was accomplished after two years of study by the J.S.
Abercrombie Company, then the unit operator, and the Old Ocean Royalty Owners Association.
The unitization plan allowed the operator to recover more productivity from the field’s vast natural

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

resources and increased the effective operations of the field on a broader economic basis. Under
unitization, there were 585 royalty owners (over 93%) and 10 leasehold operators (98%) who
were involved in the terms of the agreement. Oil and Gas Journal printed two articles on the Old
Ocean field in its September 1948 issue, stating that the field at that time was the nation’s largest
voluntary unit and had the world’s two largest separation stations installed in the Gulf Coast field.”
F.L. Nelson, the area production superintendent said, “The centralization of the field brought about
by the unitization program enables us to operate more effectively and economically” (Jordan
1961). The largest of the two separation stations—the BRLD—had 145 wells flowing into the
separator. The smaller of the two—the Ashley Wilson Station—is tied to 91 of the wells.
Jordan (1961) also notes that the discovery of the oil field changed Sweeney:
[F]rom a sleepy, farming village from a sparsely settled community to a thriving oil field
town in a relatively short time. Residents soon became familiar with the oil field jargon of
the “roughnecks” and “Christmas tree” muddy khaki-clad men wearing tin hats and the field
boots and board roads that spanned the swamps leading to drilling locations in [sic] the
advent of the oil field introduced to the community and its residents a completely new
concept of life. The 1960 census reports counted 3,007 within the corporate limits of the
city, with a total of 7,000 residing in the trade area of Sweeny (Jordan 1961).

Sulphur Mining and Industry in Brazoria County (1912 to 1972)
Sulfur deposits at Bryan Mound, Hoskins Mound, and Stratton Ridge Dome were first
mined in 1912, and soon made the county first in US production of sulfur. The Freeport Sulphur
Company employed 800 persons at Bryan and Hoskins Mound in 1930 and extracted 2,000 tons
of sulfur daily. By 1944, the firm had extracted 552,000 long tons of ore. During the 1940s, the
number of manufacturing jobs increased rapidly.
As the depletion of Bryan Mound sulfur deposits brought an end to the area's principal
industry, Dow Chemical Company, drawn to natural resources at Freeport, came in 1939 and
soon gave rise to the Brazosport industrial and port community. After the Japanese attack on
Pearl Harbor in 1941, members of the Texas National Guard manned newly established Dow
facilities, while the company constructed 2,300 dwelling units in less than two months for its
workers. By 1945, exports from Brazosport amounted to 117,610 tons. Another effect of World
War II on the county took the form of camps for prisoners of war, which housed German soldiers
and members of Rommel's Afrika Corps for a time. A second phase of industrialization began in
the 1950s as "customer companies," including Monsanto and processors of chemical fertilizers,
established operations nearby to make use of Dow products.
Industrial development attracted more workers, including people from East Texas and
some African-Americans from nearby communities, while real estate developments produced
such new Brazosport communities as Lake Jackson. By 1949, transportation facilities included
the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway and the Missouri Pacific, which operated the Houston
and Brazos Valley; the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico; the International-Great Northern; and
the Texas and New Orleans railroads. The county population grew from 27,069 in 1940 to 46,413
in 1950, and continued to expand. By 1982, at which time 17,800 persons were employed in

2,785 business establishments in Brazoria County, three decades of further growth had more
than tripled the population to 185,244.
The shrimping industry grew at Freeport after World War II. In 1967, 610 boats harvested
14,000,000 pounds of shrimp; the 1971 catch was 160 times larger than that in 1970, and the
harvest doubled again by 1972. The fishing and recreation industries, which grew up after 1960,
fostered ongoing development on the Gulf Coast.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed the THC’s online Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA), the National Park Service’s (NPS) online National Register
Information System (NRIS), the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory’s (TARL) files, and the
Texas State Historical Association’s (TSHA) The Handbook of Texas Online for information on
previously recorded cultural resources sites and previous archeological investigations conducted
within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the APE. The archival research indicated the presence
of five cemeteries within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the APE (Table 2; Figure 4) (THC
2017). The cemeteries are located well to the east of the APE and would not be disturbed in
connection with the proposed undertaking.
In addition, two Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHM) are located east of the APE
along the northern side of the Sweeny Cemetery. While OTHMs are not themselves a protected
class of resource, they can provide clues about possible locations of other historical resources.
No known archeological sites or historic properties listed on the NRHP or designated as
SALs are present within or in the vicinity of the project site. No prior cultural resources surveys
have been conducted within or immediately adjacent to the APE (see Figure 4).

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

On August 9, 2017 and April 9, 2018, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana Smith and
Charles E. Bludau, Jr., under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator,
performed an intensive archeological survey of the APE for direct effects to locate any
archeological resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
Horizon’s archeologist traversed the tract and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface
for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The APE is located on a gentle, south-facing
coastal upland flat adjacent to Stevenson Slough that ultimately discharges into the San Bernard
River. The tract is undeveloped, and vegetation consists largely of ankle- to knee-high grasses
with scattered oak trees, with dense stands of palmettos lining the banks of the slough to the
south. The tract appears to have been used primarily as a cattle pasture in the recent past, though
it may also have been used as cropland at one time (Figures 5 to 8).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 0.8 hectare (2.0 acres) for project
areas between 4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11.0 and 100.0 acres) in size; as such, a total of 14 shovel
tests would be required within the 11.6-hectare (28.7-acre) APE for direct effects. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 16 shovel tests (Figure 9). The pedestrian survey
and shovel testing revealed that sediments in the APE consist of deep silty loam or loam overlying
silty clay at average depths of 60.0 to 80.0 centimeters (23.6 to 31.5 inches) below surface in the
southern portion of the tract near the slough. Sediments in the northern portion of the tract were
shallower, consisting mainly of silty clay loam or clay loam overlying clay or compact silty clay at
a depth of approximately 40.0 centimeters (15.7 inches) below surface.
All sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. The
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all shovel tests were determined using
hand-held Garmin ForeTrex Global Positioning System (GPS) devices based on the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel testing was capable of fully penetrating sediments
with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits, and it is Horizon’s opinion that the
pedestrian walkover with surface inspection and systematic shovel testing was adequate to
evaluate the cultural resources potential of the APE. Specific shovel test data for all 16 shovel
tests excavated during the survey are summarized in Appendix A.
During the archeological field survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation,
soils, landforms, survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a

photographic log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural
resources. Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s
marks) and non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal
scrap) were to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the
same location in which they were found. As no cultural materials were observed during the
survey, the collection policy was not brought into play.
On August 8, 2017, Horizon historian Eugene Foster conducted a reconnaissance-level
historical resources inventory survey of the APE for indirect effects. The reconnaissance-level
survey was conducted to identify NRHP-listed and NRHP-eligible historic properties that may be
affected by the proposed undertaking. The APE for non-archeological resources included the
project tract as well as all adjoining property parcels. The background literature search included
published historical reports and thematic histories relevant to the history of Sweeney and Brazoria
County.
The field survey for non-archeological resources sought to locate and record buildings,
structures, objects, and districts constructed in or before 1972, as required to meet the general
50-year age criterion for NRHP eligibility and to provide a five-year buffer for project planning,
approval, and construction. Historical maps and aerial photographs were reviewed prior to the
field survey and used to locate historic-age resources in the field. Historic-age resources
identified in the field were photographically recorded and their locations were mapped using a
GPS-enabled digital camera. Online property ownership and tax appraisal records were also
reviewed for each identified historic-age resource using the Brazoria County Appraisal District
(BCAD) Web site. One interview was conducted with a local resident during the field survey to
confirm the purpose of the survey and the locations and identities of cemeteries in the vicinity.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological and historic-age sites within the APE as defined in
36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

DESCRIPTIONS OF HISTORIC-AGE RESOURCES
Resource 1

Resource 1 is a small, metal utility building located along an old pipeline right-of-way
(ROW) off the eastern side of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 321 approximately 0.5 kilometer
(0.3 mile) southwest of the intersection of FM 321 and FM 254 (Figure 11; also see Figure 10). It
is rectangular in plan, clad with metal panels, and has a flat roof. Pipes connecting the building
to the pipeline ROW suggest that this building may house oil and gas pipeline metering or
compression equipment. This building appears to be more than 50 years old based on its
condition and the industrial style of its casement window and two-panel door. It is not apparent
on historic maps and aerials of the area, which suggests that the building may have been
relocated to its current site in recent decades. The estimated date of construction is ca. 1955.
Access to the building is via a ranch gate along the southeastern side of FM 321.
Resource 2
Resource 2 is a single-story, wood-frame dwelling located at 9355 FM 524 (formerly 35
FM 524) that reportedly dates from 1959 (Figures 12 and 13; also see Figure 10) (BCAD 2017).
Architecturally, it is typical of Minimal Traditional design trends that were popular across the nation
in the mid-20th century. Design characteristics include a moderately pitched, side-gabled roof, a
front-gabled wing, and a small shed porch sheltering the front entry. The building retains its
original asbestos shingle siding on original portions of its exterior, though a room addition on its

HISTORICAL RESOURCE EVALUATIONS

Historical US Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps and aerial photographs reflect
Jordan’s (1961) description (see Chapter 4.0) of Sweeney’s transition from traditional agricultural
land uses to oil and gas extraction in the mid-20 century. A 1944 USGS aerial photograph shows
the APE south of FM 524 (Old Main Street) as a rural agricultural landscape of fenced pastures,
probably used for cattle grazing (Figure 23), and three roadways accessing oil storage facilities
along an oil and gas pipeline ROW that passes south of Stevenson Slough that forms the southern
margin of the APE. North of FM 524, a few roadside residential properties are visible on the 1944
aerial photograph interspersed along the FM 524 frontage with several access roads connecting
to active oil and gas storage facilities located farther north on separate tracts from the FM 524
residential properties. Subsequent USGS topographic quadrangles from 1952 (Figure 24) and
1976 (see Figure 1) show the area south of FM 524 (Old Main Street) to be largely unchanged,
with two oil storage facilities along the creek. The 1952 and 1976 USGS maps show increasing
numbers of residential properties along the FM 524 (Old Main Street) frontage and an unchanged
pattern of oil and gas storage facilities farther north. The most notable changes south of FM 524
include a reroute of FM 524 to pass along the southern edge of Sweeney Cemetery. Several new
roadways are also shown connecting to FM 524 and Ashley-Wilson Road, well to the east of FM
409. At present, the roadways shown on the 1952 and 1976 USGS maps south of FM 524 are
fully developed, with a trailer park and a residential subdivision.

Figure 23. Location of APE on 1944 Aerial Photograph

Eleven historical resources were recorded within the APE for indirect effects associated
with the proposed undertaking. All appear to be related directly or indirectly to the influence of
the oil and gas industry on local community developments in the post-1948 period, when the Old
Ocean Oil Field was “unitized” under the operational control of the J.S. Abercrombie Company.
Only Resource 1, a ca. 1955 oil and gas utility shed, is directly related to the greater oil and gas
operations that continue today in and around the APE. The other 10 historic-age resources
recorded within the APE are roadside residential and commercial properties built between 1950
and 1967 on the northern side of FM 524. Notably, Resources 2 to 11 all lie along the northern
side of FM 524 and back up to a field of oil and gas wells that appear to be operational to the
present day. None of the oil and gas wells depicted on historical topographic maps and aerial
photographs south of FM 524 appear to survive at present. The only commercial property in the
APE, Resource 10, is a Quonset building, possibly salvaged and relocated to this site ca. 1963
and later modified to serve as a local mechanic’s shop or garage.

J.S. Abercrombie’s unitization plan was unusual for its time and the field was recognized
in industry journals as having the world’s two largest oil and gas separation stations (Jordan
1961). However, none of the resources recorded within the APE, either individually or as a group,
adequately represent his greater contributions to the oil and gas industry in Texas and Brazoria
County. Consequently, none of the recorded resources is individually recommended for NRHP
eligibility under Criterion B for association with J.S. Abercrombie, the most prominent historical
figure associated with the resources recorded in the APE.
Individually, none of the recorded resources are believed to have been designed by a
master architect or builders, and each presents only modest architectural and engineering design
qualities. With the exception of Resource 5, most have suffered some degree of alteration in the
form of additions to their original plan or by replacement of original windows and doors.
Resources 1 and 10 may also lack integrity of location, as both are industrial building types that
are easily relocated from one industrial/commercial site to another. Consequently, none of the
recorded resources is individually recommended for NRHP eligibility under Criterion C for their
architectural or engineering design qualities.
The mixture of property types and varied construction dates suggests that the recorded
resources were built in an ad hoc manner for varied purposes over a span of 15 years by individual
property owners rather than as a group within the framework of a unified subdivision or community
development plan. Continued operation of the Old Ocean Oil Field through the late 20th century
until the present has further diminished the integrity of the group as older buildings and oil wells
have been removed and other newer buildings and industrial facilities have been built within the
APE. Consequently, the surviving historic-age resources recorded within the APE lack sufficient
historical distinction and unity of design to qualify for NRHP eligibility as a historic district.

8.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

8.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or federal
codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a
function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs, though
historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important historic events
and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources
are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological
resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs, respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

8.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are applied following the identification of relevant
historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development and
the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

8.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

HJN 170157 AR

55

Chapter 8.0: Summary and Recommendations

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

8.4

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

Horizon’s archeologist traversed the tract and thoroughly inspected the modern ground
surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The APE is located on a gentle, southfacing coastal upland flat adjacent to Stevenson Slough that ultimately discharges into the San
Bernard River. The tract is undeveloped, and vegetation consists largely of ankle- to knee-high
grasses with scattered oak trees, with dense stands of palmettos lining the banks of the slough
to the south. The tract appears to have been used primarily as a cattle pasture in the recent past,
though it may also have been used as cropland at one time.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the TSMASS require a minimum of 1 shovel test per
0.8 hectare (2.0 acres) for project areas between 4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11.0 and 100.0 acres)
in size; as such, a total of 14 shovel tests would be required within the11.6-hectare (28.7-acre)
APE for direct effects. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 16 shovel tests.
The pedestrian survey and shovel testing revealed that sediments in the APE consist of deep silty
loam or loam overlying silty clay at average depths of 60.0 to 80.0 centimeters (23.6 to
31.5 inches) below surface in the southern portion of the tract near the slough. Sediments in the
northern portion of the tract were shallower, consisting mainly of silty clay loam or clay loam
overlying clay or compact silty clay at a depth of approximately 40.0 centimeters (15.7 inches)
below surface. Shovel testing was capable of fully penetrating Holocene-age sediments with the
potential to contain archeological deposits.
No archeological resources, prehistoric or historic-age, were observed on the modern
ground surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated during the survey of the APE for direct
effects.
On August 8, 2017, Horizon historian Eugene Foster conducted a reconnaissance-level
historical resources inventory survey of the APE for indirect effects. The reconnaissance-level
survey was conducted to identify NRHP-listed and NRHP-eligible historic properties that may be

56

Archeological and Historical Investigations of the Proposed
28.7-acre Sweeny Hospital Tract, Sweeny, Brazoria County, Texas

affected by the proposed undertaking. The APE for non-archeological resources included the
project tract as well as all adjoining property parcels. Eleven historic-age resources (i.e., 50 years
of age or older) were recorded within the APE for indirect effects, though no historic-age resources
are present within the APE for direct effects.
The 11 historical resources include
2 commercial/industrial buildings and 9 single-family residences constructed between 1950 and
1967. All of the 11 historical resources within the APE, individually and as a group, are
recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

8.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations of the APE documented in this
report, no potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the APE. No cultural resources were identified that meet the criteria for
inclusion in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4, and no further archeological investigations or
historical research are recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, it
should be noted that human burials are protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In
the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the APE, even in previously surveyed areas,
all work should cease immediately at the location of the inadvertent discovery until a qualified
archeologist can assess the find, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
