Dofia Ana Phase Ceramics and Cultural
Evolution in the Southern
Jornada Mogollon

Robert J. Hard, Pamela Graeber, fimmie Manasco,
Cynthia Tennis, and Kevin Thuesen

ABSTRACT
The Dofia Ana phase (A.D. 1100-1200) in the southern Jornada Mogolton
region, in the vicinity of E1 Paso, Texas, represents a transitional period linking a dominantly hunting and gathering adaptation with a more agrarian one;
yet, it has remained enigmatic since its definition by Lehmer (1948). Problems
identifying Dofia Ana phase sites, and understanding the nature of the cultural
adaptation they represent, have persisted due to the lack of systematically
analyzed excavation data. An analysis of the ceramic assemblage excavated
from the Hueco Tanks Dofia Aria phase site (Kegley 1982), and comparisons
with Mesi!la and E1 Paso phase sites, indicate that vessel form and function
were rapidly evolving in response to shifting adaptations. A frequency seriation
of ceramic assemblages should aid in the recognition of Dofia Ana phase sites
on survey as well.

INTRODUCTION
In 1972 and 1973, George Kegley (1982) excavated site 41EP2 in Hueco
Tanks State Park for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The site represents one of the few Dofia Ana phase (A.D. 1100-1200) occupations which have
been excavated and published. Recent issues regarding this critical period have
arisen which are addressed here by a reanalysis of the ceramic collections from
the Hueco Tanks site.
Hueco Tanks State Park is located at the base of the Hueco Mountains
about 50 km east of E1 Paso on the edge of the Hueco Bolson. The Hueco Tanks
are a series of water-holding rock basins in an igneous formation that juts up
from the desert floor (Figure 1). These sheltered rock basins were a critical
source of water for both prehistoric and historic populations since moisture is
held long after the rainy season ends. The hundreds of pictographs and numerous archeological sites in the park attest to the significance of the area for aboriginal populations.

text.
Kegley’s (1982) report describes the excavation of six rectangular pithouses,
four interior trash-filled pits, and four burials and other associated features.
Based on a single radiocarbon date (A.D. 1150 + 50), the ceramic assemblage,
and architectural style, Kegley suggested that the site represented a single component Dofia Ana phase occupation.
During the Mesilla phase (A.D. 300-1100), E1 Paso Brown was the local
pottery, and house forms included both huts and pithouses (Lehmer 1948;
Whalen 1981a; Hard 1983a). The subsistence economy was primarily based
upon hunting and gathering with a relatively minor use of maize (Whalen 1981a;
Hard 1983b). Mesilla phase sites are found in a variety of ecological zones, and
there is evidence for residential use of the desert basins, as well as the riverine
and mountain foothill zones. Populations apparently engaged in a substantial
amount of residential mobility (Whalen 1981a; Hard 1983b).
The Dofia Ana phase developed from the Mesilla phase. Lehmer (1948)
suggested, based upon limited data, that the ceramics for the phase consisted of
about 50 percent E1 Paso Brown and 50 percent E1 Paso Polychrome. Dofia Ana
phase E1 Paso Polychrome rim treatments included direct thickened, direct

Hard et al, ~ DoKa Ana Phase Ceramics

unthickened, and everted forms. Whalen (1978, 1981b) formalized the
recognition of variability within E1 Paso Polychrome and characterized early
variant E1 Paso Polychrome rims as being slightly thickened with vertical necks
and rims. Rim flattening was also common. Way (1979) and Whalen (t981b)
dated early E1 Paso Polychrome ceramics from A.D. 1100-1250, roughly
contemporaneous with the Dofia Ana phase.
Dofia Ana phase intrusive wares included: Mimbres Classic Black-onwhite, San Francisco Red, Alma Plain, Mimbres Corrugated, Chupadero Blackon-white, Three Rivers Red-on-terracota, and St. Johns Polychrome. Both
pithouses and surface structures were present (Lehmer 1948; Schaafsma 1990).
The Dofia Ana phase also linked the more mobile hunting and gathering adaptation of the Mesilla phase with the reduced residential mobility and increased
use of maize in the E1 Paso phase.
During the E1 Paso phase (A.D. 1200-1400), a number of architectural
forms were present, including huts, pithouses, individual detached surface
rooms, adobe pueblos, and a large well (Batcho et al. 1985; Carmichael 1986;
Thomas O’Laughlin, personal communication 1992; Scarborough 1988). Pueblos range in size from a few rooms to more than 100. Maize played a dominant
role in the subsistence base, although wild foods remained important. E1 Paso
phase residential sites cluster into core areas located at the toes of the alluvial
fans in Tularosa Valley and the Hueco Bolson and are found along the Rio
Grande as well. Residential mobility appears to have substantially decreased and
populations increased (Whalen 198 lb).
The local ceramic ware was E1 Paso Polychrome, and the unpainted E1 Paso
Brown disappeared from the assemblage (Lehmer 1948). Lehmer (1948) noted
that rims were everted, thickened, or everted and thickened. Whalen (1978,
1981b) described late variant E1 Paso Polychrome rims as having pronounced
thickening and being flared outward about 20 degrees. The jars were constricted
at the neck, rather than at the mouth. The late variant of E1 Paso Polychrome
was widely used after A.D. 1250 (Way 1979; Whalen 1981b). The principal
intrusive types included: Chupadero Black-on-white, Three Rivers Red-onterracota, Lincoln Black-on-red, Ramos Polychrome, St. Johns Polychrome, and
Playas Red Incised.
Since the temporal phases are defined on the basis of ceramic and architectural stylistic criteria, adaptational shifts within phases are not clearly detectable, but are probably present nonetheless. There appear to be clear adaptational
differences between the phases that are useful to explore for various purposes.
The nature of the adaptation during the Dofia Ana phase has remained problematic, principally because few Dofia Ana phase sites have been excavated, and
simply recognizing Dofia Ana phase sites during survey remains problematic.
With these problems in mind, we recently reanalyzed the Hueco Tanks
ceramic collection. First, Kegley’s chronological placement of 41EP2 in the
Dofia Ana phase is reexamined, followed by an analysis of the local rim sherds,
and finally the results are placed within a larger regional context.

CHRONOLOGICAL PLACEMENT

Kegley (1982) reported a single uncorrected radiocarbon date of A.D. 1150
+ 50 from a piece of wood charcoal from House i. The local ceramic types
present were E1 Paso Brown, El Paso Bichrome, and E1 Paso Polychrome. The
intrusive types included Chupadero Black-on-white, Mimbres Black-on-white,
Playas Red, Wingate Black-on-red, St. Johns Polychrome, Three Rivers Redon-terracota, Ramos Polychrome, and a corrugated ware.
Our reanatysis, using Scott’s (1983:45-67) descriptions, indicated all of the
Mimbres sherds were either Style II, III, indeterminate II/III, or unknown. Style
II dates from before A.D. 950 until just after A.D. 1000. Style III begins in the
early eleventh century and continues to the abandonment of the Mimbres Valley about A.D. 1150 (Scott 1983). Fifty-nine Mimbres sherds were examined:
two were Style II, 25 were Style III, 10 were Style II/III, and 22 were unknown.
This distribution supports an occupation of the Hueco Tanks site during Style
III times.
A number of researchers have suggested that Mimbres Black-on-white
continued to be manufactured in the Jornada area after the Mimbres Valley was
abandoned. This brings into question the utility of the Mimbres Valley chronology for cross-dating Mimbres Black-on-white found in the Jornada area (Brody
1977; Rugge 1988; Wiseman 1982). Indeed, Rugge (1988) demonstrated with
petrographic analyses that Mimbres ceramics found in the Tularosa Valley and
the Hueco Bolson were produced outside of the Mimbres Valley, some probably
in the Rio Grande Valley. However, data from a recently excavated pithouse site
at Ft. Bliss suggests that the termination date of Mimbres Black-on-white in the
southern Jornada area must be close to A.D. 1150. The Meyer Pithouse Village
site was reliably dated to between A.D. 1150-1200 with a series of
archeomagnetic and radiocarbon dates, yet the site contained no Mimbres ceramics among a collection of 13,000 sherds (Scarborough 1989). This site indicates
that production of Mimbres ceramics in the area did not continue much beyond
A.D. 1150.
The occurrence of Mimbres Black-on-white with Chupadero Black-onwhite in the Jornada area raises a number of related issues since the ending
date of Mimbres Black-on-white, as well as the beginning date of Chupadero,
has been difficult to precisely define. Do such proveniences represent the late
manufacture of Mimbres Black-on-white, multiple occupations, or twelfth
century occupations?
Mimbres Black-on-white and Chupadero sherds were clearly associated
at the Hueco Tanks site. Out of 52 proveniences with Mimbres Black-on-white
sherds, 46 contained Chupadero, including at least one from a floor context.
Chupadero Black-on-white and Mimbres Black-on-white have also been found
in association in the Sacramento Mountains (Hayes 1981:71-72; Wiseman
1982:6), in the Mimbres Valley at the Swarts Ruin (Cosgrove and Cosgrove
1932), and in the Palomas drainage (Nelson 1992). Wiseman (1982) concludes

Hard et al. ~ DoRa Ana Phase Ceramics

271

that A.D. 1100 is a reasonable beginning date for Chupadero Black-on-white;
apparently associations between Chupadero and Mimbres Black-on-white ceramics are valid, and represent early to mid-twelfth century occupations.
A small number of White Mountain Redware sherds was found at the
Hueco Tanks site. Five sherds of Wingate Black-on-red and four sherds of St.
Johns Polychrome were identified based on comparisons with Carlson (1970).
Wingate Black-on-red dates between A.D. t050-1200, with the greatest frequency occurring after A.D. 1100 (Carlson 1970). St. Johns Polychrome occurs between A.D. 1175-1300 (Carlson 1970:39-41). One sherd of St. Johns
Polychrome was found in an excavated provenience with a Mimbres Style III
sherd at the Hueco Tanks site. St. Johns Polychrome was found as welt at the
Swarts Ruin in the Mimbres Valley, indicating that this type may occur slightly
earlier than Carlson’s estimate. In fact, the Second Ceramic Conference at the
Museum of Northern Arizona placed the beginning date for St. Johns Polychrome at A.D. 1150 (Hayes 1981:72).
Myles Miller (personal communication 1994) of the Ft. Bliss Archaeology
Program submitted 14 radiocarbon samples to Beta Analytic Inc. from the Hueco
Tanks site, including five normal wood samples and nine AMS samples of shortlived species. The tree-ring calibrated dates were distributed as follows: one in
the ninth century, one in the tenth century, four in the eleventh century, seven
in the twelfth century, and one in the thirteenth century.
The pooled mean, the variance of the pooled mean, and the T statistic
for the 14 uncalibrated dates, were calculated using Wilson and Ward (1978)
with the 50 year calibration error added to the laboratory counting error. The
pooled mean date is A.D. 1000 + 35 and T=5.5, with a chi-square value of
22.4 for 13 degrees of freedom. At the .05 significance level, the 14 dates
appear to be statistically similar. The tree-ring calibrated mean date at one
sigma is cal A.D. 1026 (1041, 1150) 1161, and at two sigma is cal A.D. 1015
(1041, 1150) 1180. The probability distributions at one sigma are cal A.D.
1030-1058 (p=.3), 1080-1124 (p=.47), and 1136-1157 (p=.23); at two sigma
they are cal A.D. 1017-1170 (p=l.0) (Stuiver and Reimer 1993).
Taking all the ceramic and chronological data into account, the occupation of the Hueco Tanks site most likely between A.D. 1075-1150. The ceramic and radiocarbon data support one another, except there are several dates
which fall outside of the expected range. The dates further suggest the occupation span may have extended to the late 1100’s.

ANALYSIS
Our analysis of the Hueco Tanks pottery considers only the 448 rims of
E1 Paso Brown, E1 Paso Bichrome, and E1 Paso Polychrome. The sample of
rims consists of 21 percent E1 Paso Brown (unpainted), 26 percent E1 Paso

272

Texas Archeological Society

Bichrome (either a red or black paint on a brown paste), and 53 percent E1
Paso Polychrome (red and black on brown) (Stallings 1931; Lehmer 1948).
This repesents one of the largest collections of brownware rims analyzed from
a single excavated site in the region. The collection is particularly useful for
verifying the seriation of local wares (Lehmer 1948; Whalen 1981b); for the
consideration of vessel forms and functions; and for diachronic comparisons.
The principal variables analyzed for each rim included: pottery type, vessel
form, rim diameter, rim direction, and the rim sherd index (RSI)--a quantified measurement of rim finish.
Three vessel forms are present: tecomates, bowls, and necked jars; no ladles
or miniature vessels were identified in this collection. The 448 rim sherds include
9 percent tecomates, 30 percent bowls, 51 percent jars, and 10 percent of unknown form.
Exterior rim diameter was only measured on sherds with a chord length (a
straight line measured between the two ends of the rim) greater or equal to 1.5
cm; 313 rims met this requirement. The mean diameter of all rims is 20 cm.
There is little difference in mean diameters among the three vessel forms:
tecomates, 18.3 cm (sd=6.1 cm, n--32); bowls, 20.8 cm (sd=4.4 cm, n=95); and
jars, 20.2 cm (sd=6.5 cm, n=186).
Rim direction categories used were inverted, direct, and everted (Figure 2).
The most commonly observed rim direction was direct, comprising 90 percent of
the sample. Everted rims accounted for 7 percent, inverted rims 1.5 percent, and
1.3 percent were of unknown rim direction. The high frequency of direct rims is
characteristic of the early variant of E1 Paso Polychrome (Whalen 198 lb).
The Rim Sherd Index, or RSI, was developed by West (1982) to quantify
rim thickening. The RSI was determined by measuring wall thickness 2 mm
below the lip and 15 mm below the lip. The lower measurement is then divided
into the upper measurement. Rims with an RSI less than 1.0 are tapered, RSIs of
approximately 1.0 are straight, and rims with values greater than 1.0 are wedged.
The mean RSI is 1.09 (sd=0.27) on a sample of 370 measureable rims,
indicating that most rims are slightly wedged. The RSIs for each pottery type
indicate that E1 Paso Brown has the smallest value at 0.97, E1 Paso Bichrome has
an intermediate value of 1.06, and E1 Paso Polychrome has an RSI of 1.12. The
early variant E1 Paso Polychrome shows the most thickening of the three
brownwares in this assemblage.
A comparison of RSI by vessel form shows that both necked jars and bowls
have similar RSIs of 1.12 and 1.09, respectively. Tecomates, however, have a
mean RSI of 0.95, indicating they have more tapered rims than the other forms.
Both direct and inverted rims have slight thickening based on their similar RSIs
of 1.08 (n=312) and 1.09 (n=7), respectively. However, everted rims have more
pronounced wedging since they have a mean RSI of 1.21 (n=25). Everted rims
and pronounced wedging occur together as rim treatment patterns.

COMPARISONS
Our analyses are relevant to two issues: (1) the recognition of Dofia Ana
phase sites on surface survey, and (2) Dofia Ana phase adaptations in comparison
to earlier and later phases. Data from four other excavated sites are considered
here, the Mesilla phase Conejo site (Hard 1988); the Dofia Ana phase Meyer
Pithouse Village (Scarborough 1989); the Dofia Ana Godernadora site (Mi!ler
1989); and the E1 Paso phase Firecracker Pueblo (O’Laughlin, personal communication 1992).
The Conejo site is located in the rainfall runoff zone nine km east of the
Organ Mountains and one kin west of the large Old Coe Lake playa in Dofia Ana
County, New Mexico, on Ft. Bliss. The radiocarbon dates primarily cluster in the

274

Texas Archeological Society

ninth century A.D. Excavations identified four circular pithouses, an additional
single large pithouse which may be a communal structure, an exterior trash
midden, and numerous interior and exterior pits. The subsistence base included
substantial reliance on wild plants, a heavy emphasis on lagomorphs, and minor
use of maize and beans (Hard 1988).
The Meyer Pithouse Village is located on Meyers Range on Ft. Bliss in
Otero County, New Mexico, about six km west of the Hueco Mountains in a
rainfall runoff zone. Three quadrilateral pithouses (which averaged 6.4 mz in
size) and a large (over 20 m2), probable communal structure were excavated
(Scarborough 1989). The site was well dated to A.D. 1150-1200. Substantial
quantities of both wild and domesticated species of charred plant remains were
recovered.
The Gobernadora site (41EP321) is located six km east of. the Franklin
Mountains, immediately north of the E1 Paso city limits, in a rainfall runoff zone.
A series of 30 radiocarbon dates suggests that the site was occupied between
A.D. 1050-1250, and it is considered to be a Dofia Ana phase occupation (Miller
1989). Four quadrilateral pithouses, a midden, a burial, numerous exterior firecracked rock features, and pits were excavated at the site. Ethnobotanical samples
recovered high frequencies of wild plant resources while the recovery of maize
was remarkedly low.
Firecracker Pueblo is located in the Hueco Bolson approximately 10 km
east of the Franklin Mountains in the rainfall runoff zone in E1 Paso County,
Texas, just outside of Ft. Bliss. The chronometric dates indicate the occupation
began about A.D. 1300 and continued to the mid-or late 1300s, all well within
the E1 Paso phase (O’Laughlin, personal communication 1992). Sixteen or 17
pithouses, including a large, possible communal room, were Overlaid by a pueblo.
Eighteen to 20 pueblo rooms were present, along with over 400 extra-mural
features. Numerous maize remains were recovered at the pueblo, as well as
evidence for use of an array of wild resources.

COMPARISONS WITH OTHER DO~4A ANA PHASE SITES
Until recently, there had been insufficient excavated data available to conduct a frequency seriation of Dofia Ana phase brownwares. The brownware rim
frequencies from Hueco Tanks, Meyer Pithouse, and the Gobernadora site are
listed in Table 1. The frequencies from the Hueco Tanks and Meyer Pithouse
Village sites are similar, while the Goberuadora frequencies are lower in E1 Paso
Bichrome and higher in E1 Paso Polychrome. However, Miller (1989) notes that
some sherds which were originally classified as E1 Paso Bichrome, were reclassified as E1 Paso Polychrome with eroded red designs. This reclassification could
account for the differences between Gobernadora and the other two Dofia Ana
phase sites. Whatever the case, there appears to be a pattern to the frequency
seriation for the Dofia Ana phase: E1 Paso Brown comprises 20-25 percent of the

The 216 rim sherds from the Gobernadora site have a mean RSI of 1.02
(Miller 1989), while the mean RSI on 370 sherds from Hueco Tanks is 1.08; the
two collections have clearly similar RSI. The Dofia Ana phase RSIs indicate that
some rim wedging is present.

absent; by the Dofia Ana phase, E1 Paso Polychrome dominates and E1 Paso
Brown and Bichrome have roughly equal frequencies. By the E1 Paso phase, E1
Paso Brown and Bichrome have disappeared. Although O’Laughlin (personal
communication, 1992) found three rim sherds of E1 Paso Brown at Firecracker,
they are not associated with the E1 Paso phase occupation. These data quantify
the conventionally accepted, although not well documented, seriation. Note particularly.that E1 Paso Brown is completely absent by the 1300s in the E1 Paso
phase (cf. Seaman and Mills 1988).
O’Laughlin (personal communication, 1992) calculated a mean RSI of 1.42
(sd=0.35) on a collection of 780 rims from Firecracker Pueblo. This is similar to
a collection of 69 E1 Paso phase rims (RSI=l.35) from a surface survey at White
Sands Missile Range (Seaman and Mills 1988). The RSI increases from slightly
more than 1.0 on the early variant of E1 Paso Polychrome present during the
twelfth century Dofia Ana phase, to about 1.40 on the late variant E1 Paso
Polychrome in the fourteenth century E1 Paso phase. Increasing RSI indicates
substantially more pronounced wedging during the E1 Paso phase.
Changes in vessel form frequencies are evident across the three phases
(Table 3). The proportion of necked jars steadily increases from less than 30
percent in the Mesilla phase to more than 75 percent in the E1 Paso phase. Bowls
decline from almost 40 percent in the Mesilla phase to about 20 percent in the E1
Paso phase. Tecomates sharply decline, and by the E1 Paso phase they .are
nonexistent. The Firecracker Pueblo rim assemblage was similar to one small
(n=69) surface collection of painted E1 Paso phase rims (Seaman and Mills
1988:Table 13.6): 23 percent bowls, 75 percent jars, and 1.4 percent tecomates.
By the El Paso phase, necked jars had become the dominant form and had totally
replaced tecomates in the assemblage.
Comparisons of mean rim diameters from the C0nejo, Hueco Tanks, and
Firecracker sites are presented in Table 4. Bowl diameters increased substantially
between the Mesilla and Dofia Ana phases, from 14.3 cm to 20.8 cm, but

increased only slightly between the Mesilla and Dofia Ana phases, 18.4 cm to
20.2 cm, but increased to 27.6 cm in diameter in the E1 Paso phase. Whalen
(198 lb) noted a similar trend in a collection of 20 necked jar rims from the E1
Paso phase that had an average diameter of 25.8 cm. Tecomates slightly increased in size between the Mesilta and Dofia Ana phases, and dropped out of
ceramic assemblages by the E1 Paso phase.

In sum, jars dominated the assemblage and sharply increased in size by the
time of the E1 Paso phase. The vessel assemblage was evolving as part of a
technology responding to shifting adaptations. However, in order to understand
these adaptations, improvements are still needed in our ability to recognize Dofia
Ana phase sites on archeological survey.

DISCUSSION
The identification of Dofia Ana phase sites on surface survey has remained
problematic. Many surveys have not attempted to identify Dofia Ana phase sites
(Seaman and Doleman 1988; Skelton et al. 1981; Whalen 1977, 1978). Other
surveys identified Dofia Ana phase sites based on the co-occurrence of a number
of ceramic types (Beckes et al. 1977; Carmichael 1986). For example,
Carmichael (1986:71-72) used the occurrence of E1 Paso Brown, E1 Paso Polychrome, Mimbres Black-on-white, and Chupadero Black-on-white together on
surface survey to identify Dofia Ana phase sites. However, multi-component
sites with both Mesilla and E1 Paso phase occupations would produce similar
ceramic assemblages.
Problems in phase identification have led to substantial differences in understanding long term cultural changes in the region. Whalen (1981 a) proposed a

278

Texas Archeological Society

gradualist model suggesting that the E1 Paso phase represented the peak in
population density, aggregation, and agricultural dependence in the southern
Jornada Mogollon. Carmichael (1986, 1990), on the other hand, proposed a
cyclical model in which the Dofia Ana phase represented a peak in population,
followed by a decline, followed by either a continued decline or a second peak.
The cyclic model is based upon the identification of a greater number of residential sites as belonging to the Dofia Ana phase rather than the E1 Paso phase in the
Tularosa Valley portions of Ft. Bliss.
Improved accuracy in the recognition of Dofia Ana phase sites in the Hueco
Bolson and southern Tularosa Valley during surface survey may now be possible
with a rim frequency seriation. Based upon the ceramic analyses discussed
above, Dofia Ana phase sites should contain: 20-25 percent E1 Paso Brown, 1025 percent El Paso Bichrome, and 50-70 percent E1 Paso Polychrome. Early rims
of E1 Paso Polychrome (rims which are largely, direct and with RSIs slightly
greater than 1.0) should dominate.
An E1 Paso phase site assemblage overlying a Mesilla phase assemblage
would not produce a similar ceramic pattern, since E1 Paso Bichrome is rare both
during the ninth century portion of the Mesilla phase, and in the E1 Paso phase. In
addition, the late variant E1 Paso Polychrome with everted and strongly wedged
rim treatment should dominate on E1 Paso phase sites. The rims from Firecracker
Pueblo indicate the late rim variant dominated by the 1300s. Way (1979) and
Whalen (198 lb) both suggested an ending date of A.D. 1250 for the early variant
of E1 Paso Polychrome.
In the future, analyses of excavated assemblages from the later part of the
Mesilla phase and early part of the E1 Paso phase may enable further refinement
of this seriation. The occurrence of Style III Mimbres Black-on-white, in association with early variant E1 Paso Polychrome or Chupadero Black-on-white, is
also a reliable indicator of the Dofia Ana phase. However, the absence of Mimbres
Black-on-white does not necessarily indicate that a site does not belong to the
Dofia Ana phase, as this intrusive ware only occurs in small amounts and it is
apparently absent after the mid-twelfth century.
Identification of Dofia Ana phase sites during surface survey is possible, but
must depend upon both a reliable ceramic collection and sampling strategy, so
that laboratory analyses and quantifiable results can be obtained on appropriate
sample sizes. Sites with few rim sherds will remain problematic without samples
for chronometric dating.
Our comparisons indicate that necked jars both increased in frequency and
size in the Dofia Ana phase and then further increased in the E1 Paso phase;
necked jars had replaced tecomates by this time as well. What was the function
or functions of these necked jars? The principal candidates are: water storage,
cookpots, dry food storage, or multiple uses.
The necked jars are restricted in that the orifice diameter is less than the
body diameter. The degree of vessel restriction reflects a tradeoff between acces-

sibility and containment security. According to research by Mills (1989) and
Smith (1985), water storage vessels tend to be characterized by small orifices
which reduced spillage.
The orifice diameters on the Dofia Ana and E1 Paso phase necked jars,
on average, are too large to be effective water storage vessels. However, restricted vessels with orifice diameters in the range of the Hueco Tanks jars
were commonly used to boil large quantities of food. Restricted vessels with
medium to large orifices are suitable cookpots as they provide access, and
reduce boil-over or spillage. Necked jars with medium to large orifices are,
however, also used for dry food storage. Mills (1989) found that vessels in
her archeological sample from the northern Anasazi area that were used as
food storage were actually recycled cookpots. The senior author has observed
a similar pattern among the Rar~imuri (Tarahumara) in northern Chihuahua;
vessels used to store seed corn, clothing, and pinole were frequently recycled
cooking jars. The most likely function of most of the E1 Paso Brownware
necked jars was as cookpots. There is one problem with this explanation-Mills (1989) reports that Anasazi cookpots are usually undecorated, since
sooting would rapidly cover the decoration. The E1 Paso Polychrome decorations are, however, limited to the upper one-third of the vessel, which would
tend to escape sooting.
If these necked jars were cookpots, what were they cooking? A number of
independent lines of evidence suggest that maize consumption increased between the Mesilla and E1 Paso phases. Settlement pattern data indicate that E1
Paso phase residential sites are more clustered in the better watered areas in
rainfall runoff zones than Mesilla phase residential sites (Whalen 1978, 1981a).
Macrobotanical recovery of maize is usually high at E1 Paso phase residential
sites but low on Mesilla phase sites (Whalen 1981a; Hard 1988; O’Laughlin,
personal communication 1992). Mano length, a proxy index of the importance of
maize, also increased between the Mesilla and E1 Paso phases (Hard 1990).
Whalen (1981a) presented evidence that population increased between the
Mesilla and E1 Paso phases as well.
One of the principal methods of preparing maize is steeping or boiling it for
several hours in order to break down the complex starch (Braun 1983; Hard
1986). Some of the necked jars would likely have been used this way as their
shape, size, and increased frequency are suggestive of a cooking pot function.
Their increased frequency may be a result of either an actual increase in the
number of pots in use in a household, and/or the high breakage rates that cooking
pots suffer. Since Dofia Ana phase jar size and frequency falls between the
Mesilla and E1 Paso phases, it would suggest that the gradualist rather than the
cyclical model is best supported by the ceramic assemblage data. Based on
changes in ceramic vessel forms, it appears that the peak in agricultural production occurred during the E1 Paso, not the Dofia Ana, phase in the southern
Jornada Mogollon region.

Personnel at Texas Parks and Wildlife, particularly Marybeth Tomka, were
generous in allowing us to borrow the Hueco Tanks ceramic collections. Because
George Kegley and his crew conducted a professional excavation and study of
the Hueco Tanks site and left the collections and documentation in good condition, we were able to undertake this reanalysis with little difficulty. The students
in the UTSA Anthropology Laboratory class in the summer of 1992 assisted with
the analyses of these sherds. Tom O’Laughlin graciously shared his unpublished
data from the Firecracker Pueblo site.
Excavations at the Meyer Pithouse Village and Conejo sites were conducted
by the Ft. Bliss Environmental Management Office. This paper was initially read
at the Mogollon Conference VII in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
