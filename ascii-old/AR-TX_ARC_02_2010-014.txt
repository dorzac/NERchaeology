ABSTRACT
The City of Grand Prairie is proposing to develop a 180-acre tract along
the shore of Joe Pool Lake in Tarrant County, Texas into a recreational
park. The property is situated on the west side of Lake Ridge Parkway and
2400 feet east of SH 360. All of the property proposed to be developed is
owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers. The purpose of this
investigation was to determine if the 180-acre study area contained
significant historic or prehistoric cultural resources. The study area is
located in an upland setting above Lynn Creek and Joe Pool Lake. Based
on the previous investigations conducted for Joe Pool Lake, the study area
had potential for containing historic and prehistoric sites in addition to two
previously recorded historic sites. The first site 41TR57 is a historic
cemetery that dates to the last half of the 19th century will be avoided. The
second site, 41TR220, was recorded during the Lynn Creek Parkway study
dates to the mid 20th century and was revisited during this study. The site
boundaries were expanded and several additional features were recorded.
Historic site 41TR237 was recorded on the south side of the abandoned
Mansfield Road that bisects the study area. The site contained two
foundations, a well, a concrete trough and trash scatters, all of which dated
to the mid 20th century. Due to poor contextual integrity, sites 41TR220
and 41TR237, are not recommended for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places. Based upon the survey results, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted
and that the City of Grand Prairie be allowed to proceed with the park
development.

INTRODUCTION

The City of Grand Prairie is proposing to develop a 180-acre tract along the shore of Joe
Pool Lake in Tarrant County, Texas into a recreational park. The property is situated on
the west side of Lake Ridge Parkway and 2400 feet east of SH 360 (Figure 1). The
archaeological survey was contracted by Teague Nall and Perkins, who is handling the
project planning and engineering for the City of Grand Prairie. The purpose of the
archaeological survey was to determine if cultural materials were present, and, if so,
make recommendations about their significance and how they might be impacted.
The cultural resource investigation was required because all of the property proposed to
be developed is owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Relevant federal legislation
includes the National Historic Preservation Policy Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515),
the National Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended
PL92500 and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The USCOE required that a cultural
resource study be conducted as part of the Environmental Assessment, and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission will review this report as the
Section 106 review agency.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the cultural history of
North Central Texas. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the
investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report
concludes with recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area lies near the ecotone of the Eastern Cross Timbers and the Blackland
Prairie of North Central Texas, just east of the Fort Worth Prairie (Dyksterhuis 1946:
Figure 1). The Blackland Prairie, in which the study area is situated, is characterized as
being grasslands with rolling topography and the Eastern Cross Timbers contain dense
oak woodlands in the bottomlands and on the upland slopes (Prikryl 1990:12-13). The
western half of the study area is underlain by Late Cretaceous Eagle Ford limestone,
which is comprised of an approximately 200 to 300 foot thick layer of Cretaceous-era
shale, sandstone and limestone (Bureau of Economic Geology: 1975). The eastern half is
underlain by Pleistocene-aged Fluviatile terrace deposits comprised of gravel, sand, silt
and clay.
Soils within the study area are the Houston Black-Navo-Heiden Soils Association, which
consists of gently sloping upland clays and loams (Ressel 1981:General Soils Map). A
variety of soils are present with the major soil types being Navo clay loam with 1 to 3
percent slopes and Silawa fine sandy loam, 3 to 8 percent slope. Along Lake Ridge
Parkway on the eastern boundary, Heiden clay, Wilson clay loam and Bastsil fine sandy
loam are mapped. Lynn Creekâs channel is mapped as containing frequently flooded Frio
silty clay, but the channel is just outside the study area (Ressel 1981:Sheet 46). Lynn
Creek is mapped as being perennial on the USGS map but as intermittent on the soils
book for Tarrant County (Ressel 1981:Sheet 46). Lynn Creek is a first order tributary of
Walnut Creek, which is a tributary of Mountain Creek that flows directly into the West
Fork of the Trinity River.
These soils permit efficient water infiltration, allowing tree roots to penetrate easily, and
provide more moisture to plants (Diggs, Lipscomb, and OâKennon 1999:46). Due to the
soil permeability, the Eastern Cross Timbers physiographic region area is biotically
diverse. In addition to blackjack and post oaks, other woody species include cedar elm,
hackberry, pecan, juniper and mesquite trees. Woody trees are not the only vegetation in
this thin band of forest surrounded by prairies; there is also a diverse selection of plants
that contribute to the dense brush and open savannahs and provided many resources to
early inhabitants (Diggs et al. 1999:46). The Blackland Prairie has scattered trees found
on high prairies and brushy prairies along the edge of the Cross Timbers. The climate of
Tarrant County is typically mild and is characterized as warm and humid. The average
high temperature is 96Ë in July and the average low temperature is 35Ë in January (Texas
Almanac 1999:264). Tarrant County also averages around 32 inches of rain per year and
has a growing season of 230 days (Texas Almanac 1999:264).
Fields of Uvalde Gravel (Byrd 1971) have been recorded in upland settings between the
valleys of the Elm Fork and West Fork on upland divides (Menzer and Slaughter
1971:217). Mapped locations of previously recorded beds of Ogallala gravels are on
upland divides to the north, south, east and west of the study area (McGregor 1995:Figure
4). These gravels are likely to be an eastward extension of Ogallala gravels (Banks
1990:56) and similar gravel fields may be present in the study area, although not shown
by McGregor.

CULTURE HISTORY
Culture History
Prehistoric occupation within North Central Texas dates before 8500 BP, and is identified
in the archaeological record by distinctive spear points such as Clovis, Dalton and
Plainview. These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain
deposits along the Upper Elm Fork of the Trinity River in North Central Texas (Crook
and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Daniel Prikryl reported that in the Lower Elm Fork area
most of the Paleoindian sites are located on the terraces above the floodplain (1990:19).
The Early Archaic period 8500-6000 BP coincides with the onset of a drying period in
North Central Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period, and isolated
Early Archaic components have been reported in the area. The Middle Archaic period
6000-3500 BP saw stabilization in the environment that is reflected in current climate
conditions of the oak-savannah and grasslands that are present as the Eastern Cross
Timbers. Middle Archaic sites are typically located on terraces adjacent to the Elm Fork
of the Trinity River rather than on tributary terraces (Prikryl 1990:73).
The population in North Central Texas as shown by site numbers saw a significant
increase during the Late Archaic 3500-1250 BP. A wetter environment contributed to
expansion of the Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands, and sites from this period are
typically found on perennial tributaries with a small density along the Elm Fork. During
the Late Archaic, there was a significant increase in the use of quartzite for the
manufacture of Gary, Ellis, Elam and Dallas projectile points, which indicates an increase
in the use of local natural resources (Prikryl 1990:76).
Sedentary life ways increased during the Late Prehistoric I period from 1250-750 BP.
The appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow and houses in the archaeological record
coincided with a drier climate shift. Site density decreases overall during this period. The
percentage of quartzite tools decreases from the Late Archaic, and diagnostics from this
period include expanded stem arrow points such as Scallorn and Alba (Prikryl 1990:7983). By the Late Prehistoric II (750-250 BP), there is an increase in buffalo bones in site
deposits and a change in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell, Fresno and Washita
arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Sites from this time period are typically
located on sandy terraces above the flood plains of major tributaries (Prikryl 1990:80).
Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been
found in North-Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas and is
possibly due to the Native Americans migrating out of the area because they were unable
to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988:103). Yet archival documents and historic
accounts in North Central Texas demonstrate that Native Americans were still present in
the area into the late 19th century.

The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around
1840, Lonesome Dove and Johnson Station, which were both settled in 1845. Lonesome
Dove, located near present-day Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant
County (Garrett 1972:55). Settlers, however, had been steadily arriving in the county
during those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants,
although only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett
1972:57).
The Civil War took its toll on Tarrant County's population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. The county's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. The railroad reached Dallas in the
early 1870s, and by 1876, it had reached Fort Worth. The community of Grand Prairie
was organized in 1863. The original name of the community was Deckman but the name
was changed to Grand Prairie to agree with the Texas Pacific Railwayâs name for the
community in 1873. Historical accounts suggest a lady had stepped off the train and
stated, âWhat a grand prairie!â The town continued to grow, especially with road
improvements and bridges constructed between Dallas and Fort Worth. In addition, the
construction of Hensley Field in 1928 added to the economic base and the field was used
during for a flight school in World War II. The economic base shifted from agriculture
and ranching to manufacturing which has allowed the city to continue to grow today
(Maxwell 2007:1-3).
Previous Investigations
Archaeological survey and testing has been conducted east and southeast of the study
area. Southern Methodist University (Skinner and Connors 1979) conducted an
archaeological survey of the proposed Lakeview Lake, which is now known as Joe Pool
Lake. Twenty-five historic and seventeen prehistoric sites were recorded along the
perennial Mountain and Walnut creeks. Further research and testing was conducted
during 1979 and 1980 by Southern Methodist University (Raab et al. 1982). Testing was
followed by intensive excavation that was conducted by Southern Methodist University
(Peter and McGregor 1988) at six prehistoric sites (41DL 148, 149, 184, 189, 199 and
41TR37). As a result of this testing, the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) was further
investigated and revealed a prehistoric site that contained three house structures,
Caddoan-looking pottery and a subsistence base that was dominated by maize. The
Bagget Branch site (41DL149), also prehistoric, appeared to contain a more âPlains likeâ
lithic assemblage.
Further historical research was conducted by Jurney and others (1988) utilizing
ethnoarchaeological investigations of the historic sites recorded in and around Joe Pool
Lake. Historic sites at Joe Pool Lake range from the mid 19th through the mid 20th
centuries and are typically farmsteads. Many of these sites are located near historic
transportation routes and in an upland setting near creeks.

Two archaeological sites, 41TR220 and 41TR57, are within the study area (TASA 2010).
Residences are shown on Sam Streetâs 1895 map of Tarrant County within and adjacent
to the study area. Two residences are shown adjacent to Mansfield Road (a.k.a. Ragland
Road) just west of the intersection of Mansfield Road and Lake Ridge Parkway on the
Soil Conservation Serviceâs 1920 soils map for Tarrant County (USDA 1920). The
residence on the north side of the abandoned Mansfield Road, was recorded as site
41TR220 in 2008 during a survey for Lynn Creek Parkway as part of a previous project
(Todd 2008). The site was described as containing a trash scatter, a concrete trough, a
well house and a windmill pipe.
During the survey for Joe Pool Lake a historic grave (site 41TR57), was recorded north
of Lynn Creek in the southern section of the study area (Skinner and Connors 1979:35).
When recorded as an archaeological site, the cemetery consisted of a granite grave
marker encircled by a metal picket fence. The marker reads âOPHELIA E. WEST, wife
of CHAS. N. WILSON 1853-1872.â The marker was erected in the 1900s by local
residents and this is claimed to be the location where Ophelia West died.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The study area is located in the uplands along Lynn Creek near the headwaters of the
watershed that eventually flows into the West Fork of the Trinity River. Despite this
distance from larger permanent water resources, the area had potential for both
prehistoric and historic cultural resources. Two research questions below were developed
to examine the archaeological potential of the study area.
Previous investigations show that the majority of prehistoric sites recorded in the area are
concentrated along Mountain and Walnut creeks, which are perennial. Yet, prehistoric
sites are known to exist in an environmental setting similar to that in which the study
project is located. Studies conducted approximately 15 miles north of the study area on
the west side of the DFW Airport along Bear Creek and its tributaries demonstrated that
prehistoric sites could be found high up in the watershed along intermittent tributaries of
perennial creeks (Shelton, Davis and Skiner 2008). Given that the study area is bordered
on the south by intermittent Lynn Creek, there is potential to find evidence of prehistoric
occupation. Due to the small size of the water drainages, such sites are more likely to be
temporary hunting camps and would consist of artifact scatters.
The study area is near a historic transportation route and residences are plotted along
Mansfield Road, as shown on the 1920 Soil Conservation Serviceâs map and the 1895
Sam Streetâs map of Tarrant County. Multiple structures are plotted on the north and
south sides of Mansfield Road on the 1959 USGS topographic map. The northern cluster
of structures has been recorded as site 41TR220, but the 1959 USGS map shows at least
four structures on the south side of the Mansfield Road. These site locations would be
consistent with historic sites recorded at Joe Pool Lake. Historic sites could consist of
structures and trash scatters. Since the study area has been continuously occupied since
the 19th century, historic structures are likely to be on the located in the uplands above the
creek. Additionally, historic artifact scatters are likely to be dumped along any drainages.
Methodology
The field teams walked parallel transects spaced 30 meters apart and made thorough field
notes about ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas. Shovel tests were excavated
in relatively undisturbed areas, where ground visibility was less than 30 percent and slope
was less than 20 percent. Each was excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposit
according to THC standards (n.d). All of the area was defined by an initial pedestrian
survey. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter, and were supplemented by an auger.
The clay fill from the shovel tests was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks
in order to determine if cultural materials were present. Sandy soils from the shovel tests
were screened through Â¼â hardware cloth. Shovel test matrices were described on the
basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify specific soil
colors in each shovel test. Photographs were taken throughout the survey area using a
Fuji FinePix J38 12.2 mega pixel digital camera. Shovel test locations were recorded with
a handheld Garmin Colorado 400t GPS unit.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections with the description of the study area
followed by the survey results. Shovel tests are described briefly in the text and are
detailed in Appendix A. Site discussions and conclusions end the chapter. Site locations
are shown in Appendix B.
Survey Area
The study area is primarily an upland setting with the western portion along Lynn Creek
being a slope setting along the creek channel (Figure 2). Vegetation in the study area was
consistent and contained junipers, mesquites and greenbriar interspersed with oaks, bois
dâarcs and hackberries. The northern boundary parallels an existing pipeline easement
and the western portion is bisected by a large transmission line easement. The western
boundary of the study area approaches Lynn Creek, but has a 5 to 8 meter drop to the
creek and is outside the study area. The northwest and western portions along Lynn
Creek contained a marshy wetland area with numerous pools of water (Figure 3). Ground
visibility throughout the entire study was between 0 and 30 percent. In the southern
section, an intermittent tributary of Lynn Creek runs north to southwest, but the
confluence has been inundated by the lake water. This drainage channel was 1 to 3 meters
wide and 50 cm to 2 meters high and was full of modern debris from past floods. The
study area is bisected by the study done for Lynn Creek Parkway (Todd 2008), which is
shown on Figure 2. Additionally; an abandoned asphalt road runs from east to west then
turns south and continues into the lake. No Uvalde gravels were noted in the study area,
and the gravels observed were limestone and sandstone.

Survey Results
Prior to shovel testing, the field crew walked parallel transects in order to identify any
cultural materials that might have been exposed on the surface. Shovel testing was
conducted throughout the entire study area. The field teams surveyed from east to west in
linear transects shovel testing on average of every 100 meters. A total of nine east-west
transects were walked and 65 shovel tests were excavated (Appendix A), seventeen of
these are associated with sites 41TR220 and 41TR237. The northernmost transect is T1
and the southernmost transect is T9 and is closest to the lake edge.
Seven shovel tests were excavated along T1. Topsoil along this transect was very dark
brown sandy clays to black clays that ranged in depth between 25 and 80 cm below the
surface (cmbs). The C-horizon along this transect varied from dark grayish brown to
strong brown sandy clay or clay. Most of them were mottled between the two colors and
some has as much as 50 percent calcium carbonate. T2 was to the south and contained 9
shovel tests. Shovel tests results and soils in this transect were fairly consistent with T1.
T3 and T4 included 8 shovel tests per line. Topsoils ranged from very dark grayish brown
to black sandy loams and sandy clays to clay. The C-horizon was dark gray or mottled
brown and strong brown clay. T4 crossed through site 41TR220 and two negative shovel
tests on this transect were used to define the northern boundary of the site. These are
discussed in the following section. Only 3 shovel tests were excavated along T5 as it

paralleled the previously studied route for Lynn Creek Parkway. These shovel tests were
similar in depth and soil color as recorded in T3 and T4.
Eight shovel tests were excavated along T6, which ran through site 41TR237. On the
eastern edge of the site along the intermittent drainage, two trash scatters were identified
and are associated with site 41TR237. The site is discussed in the following section. The
soils throughout this transect were consistent with the previous transects. Five shovel
tests were excavated along T7, while T8 had 3 and T9 had 2 shovel tests. The soils
became yellowish red to yellowish brown in T8 and T9. All of the shovel tests not
associated with sites were negative for cultural materials. Additionally, all areas outside
the site boundaries contained no cultural materials on the surface.
Site Descriptions
Site 41TR220
Historic site 41TR220 was initially recorded during a survey for the Lynn Creek Parkway
(Todd 2008). The portion of the site recorded included a trash scatter, a concrete trough, a
well house, and a windmill pipe. At the time of the 2008 survey, it was noted that the
Arlington, TX 7.5â USGS map showed several other mapped structures outside of the
parkway right-of-way. Under the present study, a site revisit was warranted to determine
the extent of the site boundaries, to determine if any standing structures were present, and
to confirm date range of occupation for the site. In addition to the pedestrian survey,
archival research was conducted at the Tarrant County Clerkâs Office, the Tax Assessor
Office, and the Tarrant County Archives. A review of Samâs Street Map and the 1959
USGS map was also conducted.
Site 41TR220 is located in Abstract No. 973-6 in the William Lynn Survey. This tract of
land is approximately 84 acres. No structures are mapped in the eastern half of the W.
Lynn Survey tract on the 1893 Samâs Street map where the site is located, yet three
structures are shown on the 1959 Arlington, Texas USGS map, and one of the boxes is
hollow indicating an abandoned structure. Construction dates are listed in the Building
Descriptions for the early part of the 20th century, two sheds in 1900, a residence, a barn
and two additional sheds in 1905, and two more sheds, one in 1918 and the last in 1920.
Approximately 71 acres were used for farming, while the remaining 13 were used for
grazing. A deed search showed that the tract of land changed ownership multiple times
from 1893 until 1979, when it was ultimately condemned for Joe Pool Lake.
No record of deed transfers between the William Lynn and Henry Baker were located,
but it appears that Henry Baker sold the land to C.B. Pool in 1893 (Deed Vol. 92, page
382). The first two sheds dated 1900 in the Tax Assessorâs records were probably built by
C.B. Pool who owned the land from 1893 until 1905 (Deed Vol. 230, page 176).
Construction of four additional structures in 1905 was most likely carried out by M.F.
Sharp, who owned the tract from 1905 until 1918 (Deed Vol. 578, page 237). It was then
purchased by G.R. Clayton and he subsequently sold it to Obaria Thomas in 1946 (Vol
1836, page 102). Obaria Thomas owned the land from 1946 to 1950 (Vol 2195, page
498). It was sold to Willis H. Hedrick in 1950 (Vol 2195, page 498) and then purchased

by Paul Massey et ux in 1952, sold to Norman Brinker et ux in 1971. The property was
condemned for the construction of the lake in late 1979 (Vol. 6865, page 1572).
Based on the previous investigations and the detail of the archival research, it was
anticipated that evidence of other 20th structures would be found and would most likely
date to the first half of the 20th century. In addition to the tank and shed previously
recorded (Todd 2008), six features and a surface scatter of historic artifacts were recorded
during the present survey (Figure 4).
Site 41TR220 was originally described as a historic home site, and features such as
foundation material, a well house, windmill foundation, as well as several trash scatters
identified in 2010 confirmed that the property was used as a farmstead. Although the
archival records mention up to eight structures were constructed on the property between
1900 and 1920, and that the USGS map shows 3 structures in the vicinity of 41TR220,
very little evidence remains of these. The area was surveyed and mapped, and a total of
nine shovel tests was placed around the features to determine the site boundaries (Table
1). The site covers approximately 2.5 acres, and the property was primarily used for
grazing.

Barbed wire fences surround the features attributed to structural remains and subsurface
artifacts (Figure 4). The artifacts include green glass and wire nails, which are both
hallmarks of 20th century manufacture. The collapsed well house and a concrete trough
near the north end of the site were originally mapped in 2008. Additional features
mapped and associated with a probable house location were to the south of these features
and included a set of upturned concrete stairs, three concrete piers, and a pile of red,
unmarked manufactured bricks. These features were deemed to be the remains of a house
as there were also several strips of metal trim used for on the edge of rooflines, rusted
paint buckets, and two car tires. To the west and southwest of the stairs and concrete

piers, a small bed of irises and a chinaberry bush were north and south of a low 10â x 15â
mound near the site core. Shovel testing in the mound (shovel test B4 and B5) identified
it as a burn pile. Green glass and ash were present, and sterile subsoil was encountered at
30 cm.

Three shovel tests were placed behind the remains of the house foundation and two (2201 and B1) contained flat window glass and brick in the first 10 cm, while the third (B3)
was negative for cultural material. Four additional shovel tests (ST220-2, 4-2, 4, 3 and
B2) were placed to the east, north and west of the mapped features; these were also
negative for cultural material. Mansfield Road was determined to be the southern
boundary of the site, and no cultural material was identified on the surface or in shovel
testing conducted to the southwest during the 2008 or the present survey.
It appears that the structures were leveled or removed based on the lack of building
material left behind. The features identified are all that remain of the homestead, and due
to poor contextual integrity, no further testing is recommended as the site is not
recommend as being eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
N. B. Anderson Site (41TR237)
The N. B. Anderson site is located in the southern half of the project area, about 1,600
feet southwest of Lake Ridge Parkway, then 250 feet south of the overgrown asphalt
road. Despite the abundant undergrowth, several features were readily distinguished
during the field crewâs initial visit to the site (Figure 5). The myriad of features include
foundations, troughs, a small pen, drilled well, trash dump, and several intrasite fences.
Large-aggregate concrete, wire nails, corrugated steel, glass, asphalt shingles, ceramic
sherds, metal cans, plastic and rubber items like gaskets and tires, and miscellaneous
household and automotive wares were represented in the artifact assemblage. In all, the
site covers an area of approximately 5.74 acres.
Archival research conducted at the Tarrant County Clerksâ Office, Tax Assessorâs Office,
and Tarrant County Archives acquired information concerning the ownership history of
this particular tract of land. As construction of the site occurred in the early 20th century
(a conclusion discussed later), it was this time period that was the research focus. N.B
(thought to be Napoleon Bonaparte) Anderson purchased this 93.73 acre tract (Abstract
961-2) the 23rd day of October, 1889. Anderson is reputed to be one of the original white
settlers in the Joe Pool Lake area, his family eventually acquired land in excess of 2,000
acres (Raab et al. 1982:187). Anderson and his heirs were well known for their success in
ranching, farming, and breeding of horses. The earliest grantee known after Anderson
was Joe S. Bryant, who purchased the tract sometime before 1965. Given the lack of
grantor and grantee information between 1889 and 1965, it is impossible to confidently
state who was responsible for construction at the site. Archival records do suggest that
the tract passed from grantor to grantee undivided until it was condemned for lake
construction in September of 1979. The integrity of the tract (That is., because it was not
sold into separate lots) gives a certain level of confidence to the ultimate conclusion that
the 5.74 acre site contains the only significant features within the tract.

Two concrete foundations were the most prominent features of the site. The larger of the
two represents the remains of what must have been a residence (Figure 6 and 7). The
house foundation was on a north-south orientation. The slab (Slab 1) is 24â x 8â, with two
poured concrete steps to ground level. Threaded bolts set into the slab around the west,
south, and east sides likely served as anchor points for wooden wall footings. In all
likelihood, this was the front porch of the farmhouse. A smaller slab (Slab 2), 15â x 5â,
was in the northeast corner of the feature; again, two concrete steps brought the
occupants to ground level. This smaller slab was probably the back stoop of the house.
Twenty-five concrete piers poured 5â to 6âapart fill the 30â gap between the two slabs.
The bulk of the house once sat atop these piers. The overall dimensions are 28â x 44â, and
supported a structure of about 1,200 square feet.

Situated 175â east-southeast of the house remains was a second poured concrete
foundation that probably once supported a barn (Figures 8 and 9). The âLâ shaped slab, as
shown, was 31â long with maximum and minimum widths of 30â and 20â, respectively. A
raised concrete footing separated the foundation into two halves. The northern half of the
slab was enclosed by this footing, while the southern half âthe area giving the âLâ shapelacked the exterior footing. Much of the southern portion was cracked and was beginning
to slump as sediments were eroding out from under it. Three wall anchor bolts set into the
concrete were still intact along the southern edge of the foundation. Two fence lines were
built roughly parallel to each other and extending southeast of the structure, probably
serving as a small pen or run for livestock. A similar, though more narrow, row of fence
posts extending north from the northwest corner suggest another pen or run on that side
of the structure. This run could have linked the barn with the concrete tank described
below.

Two smaller features were recorded north of the barn and east of the house (Figure 5).
The first was a small pen or garden, 8.5â x 15â, cordoned off by sheets of corrugated steel
set upright and fastened to wooden posts. A 9â diameter, 2.5â tall concrete tank was off
the northeast corner of the steel pen (Figure 10). The tank was filled with rusted bailing
wire and barbed wire. Presumably, a pump or windmill once accompanied the tank, but
no evidence of such was found.

Approximately 100â southwest of the house foundation was a large scatter (~10 x 15 m)
of tile printed with the label "Acme Partition Tile.â It was unclear if the tile had an
association with the house foundation. The pile might represent a wall collapse under
which another foundation could exist, yet was more likely dumped at this location.
Between the tile scatter and the house foundations was a cluster of utility lines encased in
an aboveground steel box. It is unknown if these utilities were associated with the scatter
or the foundation. Central to the site was a drilled well with a steel pipe in a concrete
footing. Depth was crudely measured with a rock tied to trench string. The field crew was
unable to ascertain the ultimate depth of the well, but it was clearly greater than 40 feet.
A trash dump was recorded near the head of an erosional gully in the southwest corner of
the site. Items in the dump included clear and brown glass shards, metal objects, and
automotive parts.
Site boundaries and deposit depth were determined by excavation of eight shovel tests
(Figure 7; Table 2). Four tests were placed at the cardinal directions, each with negative
results. These negative tests confirmed the hypothesized boundaries of the N.B. Anderson
site. Four intrasite shovel tests were excavated to explore for buried deposits. Only one,
6, contained cultural materials. The positive test was placed immediately east of the well.
Here the field crew found a metal strap with bolts and a metal hinge at 15 cmbs, then
plastic gasket material at 25 cmbs. Subsoil at the site varied from 10 to 40 cmbs.

Wire nails were present at the N. B. Anderson site, providing a solid terminus post quem
of circa 1900 (Loveday 1983:138). Large-aggregate concrete was used in the makeup of
all three foundations. This type of concrete was all but out of fashion in the 1940âs,
indicating an approximate terminus ante quem of that decade (Bill Young, personal
communication 2007). Asphalt roofing material appeared in several piles throughout the
site. With their use in residential construction beginning circa 1920, they are consistent
with the time frame outlined above. No other structural features were encountered outside
the defined site boundaries, leading the researches to conclude this represents the only
significant construction on the tract. Two small trash scatters were found near the
drainage ditch to the east of the site. The majority of the material was tin cans, glass and
tires, all dating to the mid 20th century. Additionally, two license plates were found, one
with a 1957 date and the other a 1959 date. The features and artifact assemblages at the
site suggest that the site dates between the early to mid 20th century; however, minor
modifications that did not have a significant impact were likely made into the late 1970âs
when the property was condemned for construction of Joe Pool Lake.
The Wilson Cemetery (41TR57)
The historic Wilson Cemetery was recorded as site 41TR57 in 1979 (Skinner and
Connors 1979:35). As part of the present study, a revisit was warranted to determine the
extent of the cemetery boundaries and to recommend continued maintenance and
avoidance. In addition to the pedestrian survey of the site, archival research was
conducted at the Tarrant County Archives in order to provide a more focused historical
context to the site.
Site 41TR57 is located in Abstract No. 961-2 within the James Lee Survey, and consists
of three graves within a fenced enclosure. The three headstones mark the 1872 graves of
Ophelia E. West Wilson and child, and the 1893 grave of a Bowlin child. Records
revealed that in 1872, Charles and Ophelia Wilson were moving west through Tarrant
County on a wagon train bound for California, when Ophelia Wilson entered labor. Both
she and the child, a daughter, died during the birth. Charles Wilson then marked the
location of the burials with oak saplings and continued on to California. At an unknown
time, he returned to place markers on the graves (Cage n.d.). A second infant lost in
childbirth was buried in the cemetery by James and Mattie Bowlin in 1893, due to the
lack of a readily accessible public cemetery, though the infantâs grave was not marked.
According to accounts by Webb (1952) the cemetery was fenced and well maintained
into the 1930s (Cage n.d.). By the late 1970s and early 1980s, vandals had torn down the
wrought iron cemetery fence and stolen the West family headstones. However, the US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) purchased the land on which the cemetery sits prior
to construction of Joe Poole Lake. USACE rangers recovered Ophelia Westâs gravestone,
and eventually marked all three graves, re-erected the wrought iron fence and enclosed
the entirety of the cemetery in a chain link fence (Mansfield Historical Society n.d.).
The cemetery measures approximately 15 feet east to west and 20 feet north to south
(Figure 11). The site form for 41TR57 mentioned eight graves, despite the apparent
presence of only three. The ground surface surrounding the cemetery was visually

inspected for any signs of additional unmarked burials or grave depressions. None were
observed, so the existing cemetery boundary seems to contain all the burials. All three
markers and both fences are still standing today, and appear to be in good condition.
However, the location of the cemetery as listed on TASA was incorrect. A note has been
made of this, and the THC has been notified. The site should be avoided by the project
and a 100-foot buffer should be maintained around the outer chain link fence.

Conclusions
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if the 180-acre study area contained
significant historic or prehistoric cultural resources. A total of 65 shovel tests were
excavated throughout the study area, with 17 of those associated with historic sites. The
study area is situated in an upland setting above Lynn Creek and adjacent to Joe Pool
Lake. Based on the previous investigations conducted for Joe Pool Lake, the study area
contained potential for historic and prehistoric sites and already contained two previously
recorded historic sites. The first site (41TR57) is the historic Wilson Cemetery.
The second site (41TR220) was recorded during the Lynn Creek Parkway study (Todd
2008) and was revisited during this study. The site boundaries were expanded and several
previously unrecorded features were added to the site information. No superstructures or
foundations to any buildings remained and the site had been previously bulldozed and all
the debris must have been hauled off.
A new historic site, 41TR237, was recorded on the south side of Mansfield Road. The
site contained two foundations, a well, a concrete trough and trash scatters, all of which
dated to the mid-20th century. No standing structures remained. Outside of these sites, no
other historic cultural materials were observed on the surface or in any of the 48 shovel
tests.

The research design stated that study area could possibly contain ephemeral remains of
temporary hunting or camping sites located near Lynn Creek. However, if the area was
used for hunting or gathering activities, no evidence was found. No evidence of
prehistoric occupation was found anywhere on the surface in the study area or buried in
the slope sediments. The lack of buried prehistoric site deposits is attributed to sloping
upland setting. The historic sites recorded during this survey were consistent with other
20th century farmsteads recorded in the area and during the various Joe Pool Lake studies.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the results of the survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further
cultural resource investigations are unwarranted and that the City of Grand Prairie be
allowed to proceed with the development of the park. For the archaeological sites,
41TR220 and 41TR237 are two early to mid 20th century sites recorded during the
survey. However, based upon their poor contextual integrity and lack of standing
structures, neither site is recommended for listing on the NRHP. The Wilson Cemetery
(41TR57) should be avoided by development and no construction should take place
within 100 feet of the chain link fence boundary. If cultural resources are encountered
during construction, work should immediately cease in that area and the Fort Worth
District of the US Army Corps of Engineers should be notified. Work should not
continue until discussions with the proper agency have been concluded.
