DESCRIPTIVE REPORT OF TEST EXCAVATIONS
MiohaeL R. Beokes

In mid-December 1975, limited subsurface testing was carried
out at 12 previously discovered prehistoric sites on McGregor
Range.
Several sites where surficial evidence was confusing or
insufficient for an objective assessment of significance were
examined.
In addition, an effort was made to test sites thought
to be representative of a larger class of sites occurring in a
broad range of specific physiographic or ecological zones.
The
wide dispersal of tested sites within the study area reflects the
attempt to examine insofar as possible, a cross-section of site
types and site locations.
Testing was carried out by standardized archeological field
methods.
Detailed observations on the context and association of
cultural remains. soil changes, orientation of remains and esti­
mated site extent were recorded on standardized University of
Texas field forms.
Detailed planometric drawings and photographs
were made at each tested site. Mapping of features at more ex­
tensive village sites (e.g., M410) was facilitated by the use of
an alidade and plane table.
Datum points consisted of wooden
stakes driven flush with the present ground level and marked by
small rock cairns.
Assay samples of soils, carbon, or bone were
collected where it was deemed appropriate.
The majority of the
excavations were carried out with small hand tools, both to en­
hance data recovery and to avoid scattered live ordinance.
All
soil was screened through 1/4-inch-square wire mesh.
The field
testing crew consisted of the project director, field supervisor,
and three experienced crew members.
All testing was accomplished
in a period of 15 days.
The following is a brief summary of
pertinent data from this phase of the McGregor reconna~ssance
survey.
SITE M83
The site consists of a dense scatter of ceramic sherds,
lithic artifacts, and roughly circular concentrations of fire­
fractured limestone, occurring along the primary terrace of a
major intermittent canyon drainage.
M83 covers an irregular oval
area measuring 225 x 95 m., and is bisected by a rough jeep

TEST EXCAVATIONS

trail.
The site is located midway up ~ major canyon in the Hueco
Mountains, and receives substantial shelter f~om adj~cent ridges.
During the initi
survey, ~83 wai r~corded as a tentative Do~a Ana
Phase village site.
When M83 was originally recorded, a human skeleton was ob­
served eroding from a large cut-bank in the central portion of
the site (see page 291 ff.).
Examination at that time indicated that
the skeletal remains were eroding from a large (1.5 x 1~0 m.)
oval concentration of fire-fractured limestone.
This feature
was representative of the larger rock concentrations observed on
the site.
Other~ smaller rock concentrations appeared to repre­
sent eroded hearth areas.
In December the largest concentration of rock at M83, de­
fined as Feature 3 (Fig. 11-2), was excavated in an effort to gain in­
formation about the function, age, condition ,and depth of the site.
Two l-meter-square test units intersecting the feature on the
north and south were defined.
Excavation began in Test Unit 1,
on the southern side of the feature.
The upper level of the
feature (0-10 cm.) consisted of a large concentraiton of irre­
gular pieces of limestone fixed in an ashy gray soil matrix.
A
small amount of ceramic sherds and lithic debitage was observed
in Levell.
Level 2 (10-20 cm.) was marked chiefly by a de­
cline in limestone fragments and cultural debris.
The soil
matrix was composed primarily of compact brown, sandy loam, but
with less ash or carbon flecks than Levell.
Level 3 (20-40 em.)
was marked by an absence of cultural materials.
It appeared to
represent the unmodified terrace surface and was culturally
sterile (Fig. 11-3).
Test Unit 2 was excavated in a similar manner on the north­
east portion of the feature.
A large flat slab of local lime­
stone capped the feature in Test Unit 1.
Removal of this showed
it to be a broken basin metate which had been placed face down
on the feature (Fig. 1I-23b).
Levell in Test Unit 2 was ident­
ical to Test Unit 1, with the addition of a few small fragments
of bone.
At a depth of 10 cm. a human patella and distal femur
were observed in an ashy gray matrix.
Few limestone fragments
occurred below 10 cm.
Excavation revealed a fully flexed, adult skeleton, possibly
male, lying on its right side (Fig. 1I-4,5).
The burial was ori­
ented with the head toward~~hewest.
Below 10 em., the soil matrix
was undifferentiated. ~ sliiht soil disconformity was observed
on the walls of the test units, which would suggest a burial
pit or dep~ession.
With the exception of the above-mentioned
basin metate placed over the head of the skeleton, there were
no associated grave goods.
It appears that this interment took
place near the ground surface at the time of occupation.
Un­
differentiated camp debris consisting of soil, ash, fire~
fractured rock from adjacent hearth areas and broken pottery
and lithic debris were heaped over the burial.
Finally» a

SITE M83

substantial quantity of limestone debris was added to form a
small, oval mound or cairn.
Testing and examination'of M83 indicates that the site is
shallow, somewhat eroded and probably contains a number of human
burials.
Nothing was observed to alter our original tentative
assignment of the site to the Dona Ana Phase.
SITE M8S
The site consists of a dense scatter of ceramic sherds~
roughly circular accumulations of fire-fractured limestone, and
lithic artifacts occurring along the primary terrace of a major
intermittent canyon drainage in the Hueco Mountains. M8S covers
an irregular oval area measuring approximately 600 x 400 m.
The site area receives a substantial amount of shelter from ad­
jacent high ridges.
Soils in the vicinity of the site are quite
deep and are the product of weathering of local limestone and
syenite formations.
At the time of its discovery M85 was recorded
as a tentative Dona Ana Phase village (Fig. 1I-6).
Testing commenced with the excavation of a 1 x 2 m. test
trench into Feature 3.
The feature consists of a roughly rec­
tangular (2 x 2 m.) accumulation ~f fire-fractured limestone,
ceramic sherds, lithic debris, and light gray ashy soil.
Feature
3 is representative of the larger variety of rock concentrations
at the site, and was initially recorded as a possible pit-house
remnant.
Other, smaller concentrations of fire-fractured rock
and mixed cultural debris occur at M85 and are tentatively defined
as eroded hearth areas.
The test trench was excavated in arbitrary 20 cm. levels.
Test Unit 1 was oriented along a north-south axis intersecting
Feature 3.
Levell (0-20 cm.) consisted of an undifferentiated
mass of fire-fractured limestone and a few sherds in a gray ashy
soil matrix.
A few scattered flakes of carbonized material were
noted in Levell.
Level 2 (20-40 cm.) was essentially identical
to the preceding level, with the occurrence of slightly less rock
debris and fewer sherds.
Level 3 (40-60 cm.) revealed the ap­
parent bottom of the feature, when all rock debris and cultural
materials ended at 55 cm. below present ground level.
A progres­
sive increase in the amount of carbonized material and ashy soil
matrix was observed as the bottom of the feature was reached.
Examination of the walls of Test Unit 1 revealed a distinct
basin-like profile to the feature (Fig. 11-7), with the greatest
amount of ashy soil and carbonized material occurring in the
deepest levels.
Feature 3 is defined as a remnant of a rock­
lined earth oven or dry roasting pit.
The abundance of sotol
and lechuguilla in this part of the Hueco Mountains may indicate
the vegetal resource being exploited,although no identifiable
plant remains were recovered from the feature.

TEST EXCAVATIONS

SITE MlOO

,
The site consists of an extensive scatter of ceramic sherds,
lithic artifacts, and fire-fractured limestone accumulations
occurring along the bank of a major intermittent stream on Otero
Mesa.
MlOO contains numerous scattered areas of fire-fractured
rock which suggest midden accumulations of ash, rock fragments,
ceramic sherds, and lithic artifacts.
The site is roughly rec­
tangular in shape, and covers approximately 30 acres.
The loca­
tion of MlOO offers no shelter from prevailing winds or severe
weather.
The site was originally recorded as a large seasonal
camp or agricultural hamlet probably of El Paso Phase affiliation.
Testing was initiated by the excavation of Test Unit I, a
narrow (60 cm. x 2.5 m.) trench oriented perpendicular to an
elongated, shallow depression (Feature 6) thought to represent
a possible aboriginal water diversion ditch.
Excavation proceeded
by arbitrary 20 cm. levels and revealed a lack of natural strati­
graphy to a depth of 2 meters.
The deposits observed consisted
of an undifferentiated, light gray. fine textured loess.
An
ephemeral soil disconformity corresponding to Feature 6 was ob­
served in profile in the north and south walls of Test Unit 1.
This consisted of a slight textural change toward greater grain
size in the area of the trench walls intersected by Feature 6.
No evidence of aboriginal activity was observed in Test Unit 1.
Feature 6 was defined as a natural erosional feature.
Test Unit 2 consisted of a 1 x 4 m. test trench bisecting
Feature 2.
That feature was a large, circular (5 m. diameter)
concentration of fire-fractured rock, ceramic sherds, lithic
debris, and ash, located in the north-central part of the site (Fig.
11-8).
Excavation proceeded by arbitrary 10 cm. levels until the
natuial strata was reached.
Levell (O-lO cm.) consisted of a heavy
deposit of mixed fire-fractured rock fragments, gray, ashy matrix
and a few scattered ceramic sherds.
Level 2 (10-40 cm.) was a
natural level characterized by a light gray. compacted, ashy
matrix containing substantially less fire-fractured rock and
cultural debris than Levell.
Two possible hearth areas were
observed in Level 2 at an average depth of 10-15 cm. below
present ground level.
These appeared as semi-circular to oval
arrangements of irregular limestone fragments, containing depos­
its of a dark gray, ashy soil, intermixed with numerous small
fragments of charcoal.
The larger feature measured 60 x 51·em.,
while the smaller averaged 20 em. in diameter.
No artifaetual
materials were observed in or around either feature.
A l-meter­
square area at the south end of Test Unit 2 was excavated to a
depth of 1.5 m. in an effort to ascertain the thickness and
character of the ashy, compacted floor zone containing the two
hearth features.
This sounding revealed the compacted zone to
extend from 20 cm. to 24 em. below present ground level, and to

be underlain by a thick deposit of gray loess similar to that
encountered in Test Unit 2.
No cultural materials were observed
below 25 cm.
Test Unit 2 was extended a distance of 2 m. to effectively
bisect Feature 3, to determine the horizontal extent of the ini­
tial excavation.
A compacted, dark gray zone of mixed rock frag­
ments, charcoal fragments and ash averaging 20 cm. in thickness
was observed continuously across Feature 3.
This was defined as
a probable living floor accumulated within or beneath some sort
of temporary structure.
Test Unit 3 consisted of a 1 x 3 m. trench bisecting an
unusual rectangular depression (Feature 3) in the south-central
portion of the site.
Feature 3 was originally recorded as a
possible structural remnant, bounded on two sides by large trash
middens (Fig. 11-8).
Excavation proceeded by arbitrary 10 cm.
levels until natural strata were encountered.
The northeast end
of Test Unit 3 reached a depth of 35 cm. in an undifferentiated
deposit of culturally sterile, gray loess, identical to that ob­
served in Test Unit 1.
In the southwestern end a deposit of
light-brown sand, containing a substantial amount of ash and
charcoal fragments was observed to reach a depth of 10-15 cm.
This apparent cultural level contained a sparse deposit of lithic
debitage and a few sherds and exhibited a greater degree of com­
pactness than the adjacent loess.
The area of the apparent
cultural layer corresponded exactly with the visible margin of
Feature 3.
A second 1 x 5 m. test unit was placed perpendicular to
Test Unit 3, in an effort to determine the horizontal extent of
Feature 3.
This unit reached a depth of 50 cm. below present
ground surface and revealed a continuous 10-15 cm. thick zone of
compacted dark gray, sandy ash, fire-fractured rock, charcoal
fragments corresponding to the observable surface extent of
Feature 3 (Fig. 11-9).
A circular (19 cm. diameter), dark stain
was observed in the western part of Test Unit 4 at a depth of
12 cm.
This feature may represent a poorly preserved postmold or
a very small hearth area.
Below approximately 15 cm. the dark,
ashy cultural zone is abruptly replaced by a culturally sterile
deposit of light gray-to-brown, fine-textured silt which ap­
parently marks the original surface of the site (Fig. 11-10).
Fea­
ture 3 was defined as a compacted, living-floor deposit of ~ixed,
cultural debris which apparently accumulated within some sort of
temporary (possibly ramada-like) structure.
The limited test excavations carried out at MIOO supported
our original definition of the site as a probable EI Paso Phase
seasonal camp or agricultural hamlet.
The amount, type and
variety of cultural remains observed at MIOO indicate occupation
and utilization by a substantial number of individuals, possibly
on a recurring basis.
The site was shown to be generally shallow

and to lack the type of structural or artifactual remnants more
commonly found on large sites of sedentary groups of the period.
It is our opinion that MIOO represents a limited function, agri­
cultural hamlet, seasonally occupied to take advantage of run­
off waters from Wildcat Draw and the deep, fine-textured soils
found at this location.
SITE Ml03
The site consists of a small (21 m. wide x 4 m. deep x 2 m.
high), west-facing, rockshelter which overlooks a small, inter­
mittent drainage in the Hueco Mountains.
Ml03 is well protected
from the elements by surrounding cliffs and ridges.
The site
lies in rugged and inaccessible terrain and affords an excellent
vantage point.
At present a dry, friable, gray, fine-grained
sediment fills the shelter to within 1 meter of the overhang in
most areas.
A sparse surface scatter of ceramic sherds and
lithic tools was observed by the survey crew.
In addition, five
large bedrock mortars averaging 23 cm. diameter x 60 cm. deep
and three panels of red monochrome pictographs were observed in
FIGURE 11-5.

or near the shelter.
Near the northern end of the shelter a
large boulder was observed to ex~ibit a number of highly-polished
areas with hundreds of small grooves or notches cut into the
stone.
At the time of its discovery the site was recorded as a
Ceramic Period occupation area, although an underlying Archaic
residue was considered likely.
Testing was initiated near the southern end of the shelter
by the excavation of a l-square-meter test pit.
The location
and small size of this excavation unit was dictated as much by
the presence of numerous unexploded artillery shells within the
shelter as by time limitations (Fig. II-~1,12).
Test Unit 1 was
excavated in arbitrary 2 cm. levels until the presence of dis­
cernable material stratigraphy was confirmed at 5 cm.
There­
after excavation was by natural strata.
Levell (0-5 cm.) consisted of an extremely fi~e-grained,
friable, gray sediment, mixed with decayed vegetation and animal
dung.
No cultural remains were observed in Levell.
Level 2 was a natural stratum originating at a depth of
5.3 cm. below the current surface and extending downward to a
depth of 22 cm.
Level 2 is characterized by a darker gray,
coarser sediment than the preceding level and by a slightly
greater degree of compaction.
Several small sherds, a few flakes
of worked local mudstone, and several small fragments of char­
coal were recovered from Level 2.
Numerous small, irregular
roof spalls were noted throughout the stratum.
No structural
features were encountered.
Level 3 (22 -50 cm.) was a natural stratum character­
ized chiefly by a darker gray color, a substantially increased
spall and ash content and by the presence of numerous small
fragments of reddish, baked clay.
Level 3 conformably underlies
the preceding stratum and yielded several small, decorated
ceramic sherds and numerous small flecks of charcoal.
At a
depth of 30 cm. below the present surface a small (50 x 80
cm.) oval concentration of fire-fractured rock, ash and charcoal
fragments (Feature 2) was encountered on the floor of the test
unit.
The feature was examined and shown to be a small, rock­
lined hearth containing a substantial amount of light gray, fine­
textured ash and numerous small charcoal fragments.
Several
decorated sherds, a small core of local chert and a small
quantity of worked chert flakes were recovered from the ash
matrix within the feature.
An additional quantity of sherd~
and'.orked~ehert flakes was observed in direct stratigraphic
association with the feature.
A radiocarbon date of A.D. 990 ±70
(TX2343) was obtained on a sample of charcoal from the center
of the hearth.
Level 3 continued beneath Feature 2 to a depth
of 50 cm.
Large quantities of fire-fractured rock, ash, burned
bits of clay, lithic debitage and charcoal fragments were con­
tained within the dark gray, Level 3 matrix.
A decrease in the
presence of ceramic material was noted in the lower portion of
Level 3.

Level 4 (50-58 em.) was a culturally sterile deposit of
coarse, mixed gravel and limestone fragments.
These markedly
coarser sediments conformably und~rlie Level 3 and probably
represent colluvial materials from above the shelter.
Level 5 (58-60 em.) consisted of a very fine-ground dark
gray silt conformably underlying Level 4.
A small quantity
of light gray ash and small flakes of carbonized material were
observed within Level 5.
Five small sherds of undecorated brown
pottery were recovered from the lower part of the stratum.
No
structural features were observed.
Level 6 (60-69 em.) consisted of a darker gray, coarser­
grained, silty sediment underlying LevelS.
The stratum is
chiefly distinguished by a slightly greater degree of compac­
tion and larger grain size than the preceding level.
A few
small fragments of charcoal were observed within the stratum.
Level 7 (69-83 em.) consisted of a second culturally-sterile
deposit of mixed gravel and limestone fragments.
The stratum
apparently represents colluvial material from above the rock­
shelter washed into the site.
Level 8 (83-100 em.) is a natural stratum of fine-grained,
dark gray, silty sediment containing a small quantity of char­
coal fragments.
Level 8 is chiefly distinguished from preceding
silty levels by a much darker color and higher moisture content.
Level 9 (100-120 em.) consisted of a mixed deposit of fine­
grained, dark gray silt; small, irregularly-shaped roof spalls
and colluvial gravel.
A few small fragments of charto.~w~re
noted within the stratum.
No structural features or artifactual
materials were observed.
Bedrock or a very large roof spall was reached at a depth
of 120 cm. below the present surface.
Time limitations permit­
ted no further exploration.
Test Unit 1 was marked by a wooden
stake pounded flush with the surface and back-filled.
The in­
formation gained from limited testing at Ml03 suggests that the
site was occupied at a number of times in the past, and that it
may contain late Archaic/early Ceramic Period materials of con­
siderable regional interest.
SITE M266
The site tonsists of three roughly rectangular depress~ons,
a single eoncentration of fire-fractured rock and a moderate
scatter of sherds and lithic artifacts occurring on a primary
terrace of the Sacramento River.
M266 covers an irregular area
measuring approximately 200 x 40 m., and is being eroded by
the Sacramento River on its eastern margin.
The site has a
southeast exposure and is well sheltered from prevailing winds
by an adjacent high ridge.
At the time of its discovery, frag­
ments of carbonized wood, a broken basin metate and several

large sherds of EZ Paso Brownwara were observed eroding from the
eastern edge of the site at a depth of 26 cm. below the present
ground surface.
A marked change in the growth of coarse grasses
was observed in the vicinity of. three rectangular depressions,
suggesting possible subsurface structural remnants.
Testing was confined to Feature 1, a rectangular depression
(2.5 x 3 m.) lying on the extrem-e e~sterl1edgeof the site.
A small 1 x 3 m. test trench inter~ecting th~-feature from the
south was excavated.
The test unit was excavated in arbitrary
10 cm. levels and reached a depth of 1 mater.
Mixed cultural debris
in the form of sherds, lithic artifacts and debitage were en­
countered to a depth of 20 cm.
No structural remnants were ob­
served in the test unit or in profile in the trench walls.
The
soil matrix to a depth of 1 m. consisted of unsorted colluvial
material apparently reaching the site from the adjacent ridge.
The eastern edge of Feature 1 had been eroded by the
Sacramento River, creating a steep cut-bank.
This was carefully
profiled and examined for evidence of subsurface features or
cultural materials.
Several large ceramic sherds, a projectile
point base and a quantity of fire-fractured limestone were ob­
served at depths ranging from the surface to 10 cm.
The cultural
materials were held in a matrix of mixed colluvial material.
The
carbonized material reported by the survey crew proved to be
burned roots.
Feature 1 was re-defined as a natural depression which had
received mixed deposits of colluvial sediment and cultural debris
from higher portions of the site.
Some additional deposition of
materials by over-bank flooding of the Sacramento cannot be
ruled out.
It is probable that subsurface structural remnants
do exist in higher portions of M266, although time limitations
did not permit further testing.
srTE M3l0
The site lies in a low saddle between a high, isolated butte
and a low sandy ridge in the desert lowlands of the lower basin.
It consists of more than 30 distinctive midden-like concentra­
tions of fire-fractured rock, sherds, lithic artifacts, and gray
ashy soil (averaging 15 m. in diameter), and/numerous smaller
bur~ed ~ock concentrations ~ugg~stin~ hearths.
Cultural mate­
rials are exposed over a roughly oval area measuring approx~mately
1500 x 770 m.
A large intermittent stream course is currently
located 1 km. south of the site, although relict channels indi­
cate that it lay closer to the site at some earlier date.
The
large butte to the south of the site area provides an excellent
vantage point and some degree of shelter from prevailing south­
west winds.
Soils in the area are composed of mixed sands and
light gray, fine-grained colluvium.
At the time of its discovery
M3l0 was recorded as a possible El Paso Phase sedentary village.

TEST EXCAVATIONS

18

In December a more intensive surface examination of the site
was carried out and a larger, systematic collection of ceramic
materials was gathered.
Precise~delineation of the occupation
area proved very difficult due to encroachment of the site by
sand dunes on the southwest perimeter, and severe sheetwashing
along the eastern edge.
Feature 2, a large (10 x 12 m.) concen­
tration of fire-fractured rock, ceramic sherds, lithic artifacts
and ashy soil was selected for testing. A 2 x 3 m. test trench
was oriented along a north-south axis intersecting Feature 2
near its midpoint.
Excavation was by arbitrary 10 em. levels.
From present ground level to a depth of 32 em. an undifferen­
tiated deposit of ash, fire-fractured rock, and mixed ceramic
and lithic artifacts was encountered. No structural remnants
were observed on the floor of the test unit or in profile in the
walls.
Excavation ceased at a depth of 50 em. in a culturally
sterile deposit of reddish sand and caliche.
Time limitations
prevented examination of other features.
Feature 2 is interpreted as a probable living floor accumu­
lation of cultural debris and refuse, rather than as a trash
midden.
The clearly delimited outline of Feature 2 may suggest
that it accumulated within some sort of perishable or portable
structure, possibly a ramada-like affair.
It is not presently
known if Feature 2 is representative of the majority of similar
features at M3l0.
If this should prove to be the case, however,
it may indicate that the site was utilized on a seasonal basis
rather than as a permanent habitation.
A substantial amount of
further testing is required to determine if the dense deposit of
cultural material present at the site is the result of periodic
seasonal occupation or more permanent sedentary habitation.
SITE M362

(see page 39, this section, for a note on Site M362).

SITE M377
The site consists of a dense scatter of ceramic and lithic
artifacts surrounding a well-preserved historic ranch. More
than twenty distinct concentrations of fire-fractured rock,
gray ashy soil and mixed cultural debris thought to represent
trash middens were observed.
The site covers a roughly circular
area with a diameter of approximately 1 km.
Two packed-clay
hearths (50 cm. in diameter) and a number of apparent adobe wall
remnants were reported by the original survey party to be visible
in a narrow roadbed which bisects the site.
At the time of its
discovery M377 was recorded as a probable El Paso Phase village.
The site is located in the sandy, desert lowlands of the
central basin. No particular vantage point or degree of shelter
from adverse climactic conditions is afforded by the location.
A large intermittent stream course or wash is located approxi­
mately 0.5 km. south of the site.
Soils in the area consist of
mixed, fine-grained sediments.
At present the site is being

encroached upon by large, semi-stable sand dunes along the
entire southern perimeter.
Shee~ washing and vehicular dis­
turbance have affected most of the central portion of the site.
Testing was initiated by the excavation of a 1 x 4 m. test
trench into Feature 3, a large (6 m. in diameter) concentration
of sherds, lithic debris, and gray ashy soil.
This feature 1S
generally representative of the larger class of cultural features
visible at the site and was originally recorded as a possible
trash midden or living floor accumulation.
Excavation was by
arbitrary 10 cm. levels.
Levell (0-10 cm.) consisted of a dark
gray, ashy soil matrix with a substantial amount of sherds,
flakes of carbonized material and lithic debris occurring.
Level
2 (10-20 em.) was slightly less compact than Levell, and was
characterized by a lighter gray matrix containing few cultural
remains of any kind.
Level 3 (20-35 cm.) was culturally sterile
and consisted of a light brown, sandy loam.
No structural
features of any sort were observed.
Test Unit 2 consisted of a 1 x 1 m. excavation directly on
the center of Feature 3.
The unit was excavated in arbitrary
10 cm. levels, and virtually duplicated the information from
Test Unit 1.
Cultural materials consisting of ceramic sherds,
lithic artifacts and flecks of charcoal were observed in a dark
gray, ashy matrix to a depth of 30 cm.
Below this level the in­
cidence of cultural remains dropped off appreciably as the matrix
changed to an uncompacted, dark brown sandy loam.
A single sherd
of El Paso Brownware was observed at a depth of 40 cm.
Below
this level the deposits were culturally sterile.
No structural
remains weraobserved.
Test Unit 3 consisted of a 1 x 1 m. pit excavated in the
center of Feature 4, a small (2-mete~-s~uare), very dense concentra­
tion of sherds in the northern portion of the site.
Feature 3
is representative of a class of small, discrete concentrations
of artifactual remains and was originally recorded as a probable
special activity locus or living floor.
Excavation proceeded by
arbitrary 10 cm. levels and revealed an undifferentiated deposit
of dark gray ash and mixed cultural debris to a depth of 30 cm.
Below this level the soil matrix changed abruptly to less­
compacted, culturally-sterile, dark red sand.
Test Unit 3
reached a depth of 1 m. and revealed no structural remains of
any kind.
Test Unit 4 consisted of a I x 3 m. trench excavated into
the north embankment of the unimproved jeep trail which bisects
the site.
The test unit;was oriented to coincide with an ap­
parent adobe wall line visible in the roadbed at this point.
A
rectangular (20 ~ 30 em.) soil disconformity corresponding
to the apparent wall line visible in the roa~bed was observed in
the north embankment.
Excavation in the area revealed a very
compacted mass of puddled adobe running northward from the road­
bed to an undetermined distance.
Close examination revealed this

mass to be an adobe wall remnant covered by a mass of badly
eroded, tumbled adobe wall membe~s.
Since erosion and vehi­
cular traffic had exposed a much larger portion of this feature
than we could hope to expose in the limited time permitted us,
the section of roadway abutting Test Unit 4 was carefully
troweled down, swept and examined for features.
The effort revealed the existence of another wall remnant
joining the one revealed in Test Unit 4, forming a corner or
right angle in the roadbed.
This second wall ran southwest from
its abutment with Wall 1 for a distance of 6.5 m. before vanish­
ing beneath a large sand dune.
Careful examination of the area
contained within the right angle thus formed revealed the exist­
ence of an extremely compacted clay living floor, containing two
circular (averaging 30 cm. in diameter), basin-shaped hearths,
and a small basin metate fragment of black vesicular basalt.
Several large sherds of El Paso Bpown and Chupadepo B/W were
recovered in situ on the floor of the structure.
Limitations on
field time and severe weather precluded further examination of
M377.
The thin accumulations of cultural materials revealed in
Test Units 1, 2, and 3 are thought to represent compacted living
floor debris which accumulated within ephemeral temporary shel­
ters, possibly of a ramada-like configuration.
Purely on strati­
graphic evidence, these features appear to antedate the occupa­
tion evidenced by the square house remnant revealed by Test Unit
4.
This may suggest a later, seasonal utilization of an earlier
large habitation site, or it may indicate that the living floors
represent outdoor activity loci associated with a sedentary vil­
lage.
At present insufficient data exist to speculate further
about the nature of M377.
We can state confidently, however,
that the site is extensive, that it contains buried structures
and that it may be the result of multiple occupations.
No data
suggesting an earlier date for the site than our original El
Paso Phase estimate was obtained.
SITE M402
The site consists of a large (25 m. wide x 3.5 m. deep x 7.4 m.
high), dry, east-facing rockshelter, located well up a narrow steep­
walled canyon in the Sacramento Mountains (Fig. 11-13).
A large
intermittent stream course lies directly below the shelter.' Ad­
jacent ridges provide a high degree of shelter.
At the time of
its discovery three distinct areas of ash, possibly indicating
hearth locations, were observed on the dry, unconsolidated floor
of the shelter.
In addition, a large expanding stem projectile
point of local black chert and a sparse scatter of lithic debi­
tage was recorded.
A substantial outcrop of high quality black
chert was discovered approximately 0.5 km. south of the site.

SITE M402

23

Testing was initiated by the excavation of a 1 x 3 m. test
trench in the southern end of the shelter.
Location of the test
unit was aimed to coincide w~th the area of greatest apparent
depth of fill, and to bisect Feature 2, a small (30 cm. diameter)
depressed area.
Excavation was by arbitrary 10 cm. levels.
Test Unit 1 reached a depth of 1.5 m. in a culturally sterile,
undifferentiated deposit of dry, gray, compacted sediments.
This
deposit appears to be the result of slow weathering of the
Permian limestone overhang which forms the shelter.
No struc­
tural remains other than Feature 2, a shallow basin-shaped ash
deposit, were observed in the test trench.
No artifacts of any
type were observed.
No further testing was possible due to time
limitations.
It is apparent that M402 contains a dry deposit of natural
sediments at least 1.5 m. deep.
Although our test revealed no
buried cultural residues, this may have been a function of the
test location.
Our current data indicate that M402 was briefly
utilized at some time in the past as a short-duration shelter.
This utilization may have been limited.
SITE M407
The site consists of an extremely large (109 m. wide x 26 m.
deep x 15 m. high), south-facing rockshelter overlooking the desert
lowlands of the northern basin.
A large intermittent stream course
or wash lies approximately I km. south of the site.
In addition a
small spring is located in the rear of the shelter.
At the
time of its discovery the survey crew observed six distinct con­
centrations of ash indicating hearth areas, four extensive
pictograph panels, a large circular area near the center of the
shelter which had been cleared of rock debris and spalls and
several small corn cobs cached in a crevice at the rear of the
shelter.
In addition a small fragment of yucca fiber matting
or sandal was recovered from an apparent pothole or animal
burrow.
No ceramic remains were observed.
The floor of the site consists of an unconsolidated deposit
of decomposed limestone, and eolian sediments.
A substantial
amount of animal dung has contributed to the visible deposits.
The protected nature of the site has resulted in the formation
of extremely dry, friable sediments throughout the shelter.
Our limited testing was intended to provide data on the depth
and nature of the shelter fill.
Excavation was initiated in Test Unit 1, a 1 x 4 m. trench
oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the shelter.
The
test unit was placed in an area of great apparent depth of
sediments and bisected Feature 4, a large (60 cm. in diameter),
circular depression containing ash and lithic debitage.
Excava­
tion was by arbitrary 10 cm. levels until the existence of
natural strata was confirmed.
Level I (0-10 cm.) consisted of

an extremely dry, dusty deposit of light gray sediment mixed with
ash and lithic debitage.
Feature,4 proved in profile to be a
shallow basin-shaped hearth, 9 cm. in depth.
Level 2 (10-25 em.)
was a natural strata.
It is distinguished from Level I by the
presence of more limestone spalls, a greater degree of compact~
ness, and a distinctly darker color.
Cultural remains in the
form of small worked flakes of chert and a small amount of lithic
debitage occur throughout the level.
An apparent hearth, Feature
6, was noted in profile in the rear wall of the test unit.
This
feature originated at a depth of 15 em., and continued down to a
depth of 25 em.
It was marked by a distinctive ash concentration
45 cm. in width.
Several small worked flakes of local chert were
observed in the feature.
Level 3 (25-42 cm.) is characterized by a darker color and
greater degree of compactness than the preceding stratum.
A
substantial amount of gray ash and small, worked flakes of local
chert were observed throughout the level.
A second basin-shaped
hearth (Feature 7) was noted in profile at the rear of the test
unit.
This feature consisted of a shallow (47 cm. wide x 11 cm.
deep) basin-like deposit of friable, light, gray ash.
Feature 7
originated at 27 cm. below the surface and terminated at 38 cm.
Non-cultural sediments in Level 3 consist of coarse-grained, dark
gray decomposed limestone, intermixed with large quantities of
irregular limestone spalls.
Level 4 (42-70 em.) was the deepest stratum reached in Test
Unit I because of time limitations.
The stratum is characterized
by a very compact, dark gray, granular sediment, intermixed with
a large quantity of limestone spalls, ash, and a few worked
flakes of local chert.
Level 4 is distinguished from Level 3
primarily on the basis of its generally darker color and by its
coarser matrix.
At a depth of 70 cm. below the present surface,
Feature 8, a circular (30 cm. in diameter) concentration of
light gray ash mixed with flakes of carbonized material was
encountered.
Numerous small fragments of worked chert were ob­
served in the feature.
Feature 8 was bisected and defined as a
shallow (10 cm.), basin-shaped hearth.
A small sample of carbon
fragments was collected but this proved insufficient for radio­
carbon dating.
An irregular mass of limestone spalls and calcium
carbonate observed in Level 4 near the eastern edge of the test
trench was carefully examined.
This proved to be a natural
feature caused by highly mineralized water dripping from the
ceiling of the shelter and cementing an accumulation of roof
spalls.
The limited subsurface examination of M407 indicates that at
least one portion of the site contains discretely stratified
sediments containing cultural materials to a depth of at least
70 cm.
All indications are that the deposits are considerably
deeper and are relatively undisturbed.
The extremely dry sub­
surface environment is very favorable for the preservation of

perishable artifacts.
At present it is impossible to determine
if the complete absence of ceramic remains at M407 is temporally
significant, or is related to site function or merely sampling
error.
SITE M4ll
The site consists of a dense deposit of fire-fractured rock,
ceramic sherds, lithic artifacts and lithic debitage occurring
along the primary terrace of a major intermittent canyon drainage
in the northern basin lowlands.
Cultural materials occur in
deflated interdune areas over a roughly oval area measuring ap­
proximately 200 x 95 m.
A continuous cultural stratum containing
mixed ceramic and lithic artifacts is exposed in an arroyo cut­
bank along the western edge of the site for a distance of approx­
imately 100 m.
Several features, including two apparent refuse
pits, a small basin-shaped hearth, and a child burial, were
visible in profile.
At the time of its discovery the site was
recorded as a tentative late Mesilla/early Dona Ana Phase
village.
The site lies at the mouth of two major canyon drainage
systems in an area of coalesced alluvial fans and low semi-stable
sand dunes.
The greater portion of the site area has been
partially covered by dark red sands.
Interdune culture-bearing
sediments consist of a fine-grained, light gray silt.
In profile
(Fig. 11-14), the single cultural stratum, Zone 2, consists of a
dark gray to black humic soil matrix containing a substantial
admixture of ash, charcoal fragments, sherds, fire-fractured rock
and lithic artifacts.
Zone 2 is directly overlain by a thick
deposit of coarse-grained, dark brown sand, Zone 3.
Contemporary
(presently active) dark red sand dunes in turn overlay Zone 3 in
much of the site area.
The single stratum having artifactual
remains (Zone 2) overlaps a deposit of reddish-brown sands of
undetermined depth.
Testing at M4ll was confined to troweling and close examina­
tion of the extensive natural profile along the northwestern
perimeter of the site.
An assay of charcoal fragments from a
portion of Zone 2 immediately overlain by two distinct dune
phases yielded a radiocarbon date of A.D. 660 ±200 (TX2405).
The carbonized material at the sampling location was directly
associated with several large sherds of EZ Paso Brown and a .
small quantity of lithic debitage.
A carbon sample from Feature
2, an adjacent refuse pit, proved insufficient for dating.
Feature 2 consists of a rectangular (50 cm. deep x 36 cm. wide)
soil dis conformity originating at the Zone 2/Zone I interface
and intruding into Zone 1.
Feature 2 is filled with typical dark
gray Zone 2 sediments and contains mixed cultural debris con­
sisting of EZ Paso Brown sherds and lithic debitage.
Feature 3 consists of a smaller rectangular disconformity
originating at the Zone 2/Zone 1 interface and intruding into

Zone 1.
This apparent refuse pit measures 43 cm. deep x 35 cm.
wide, and contains typical' Zone 2,fill, identical to that in
Feature 2.
Both Features 2 and 3 are simple, unlined pits ex­
cavated into Levell.
At present it is impossible to determine
if both originated at the Zone 2/Zone 1 interface or if a strati­
graphically higher level of origin has been subsequently obscured.
Feature 5 is a child interment observed eroding from a
large cut-bank in the northwestern part of M4ll.
The skeleton
was tightly flexed, upright, and faced south.
No grave goods
were observed.
A simple, unlined pit originating in Zone 2 was
excavated into Zone 1, the child was placed in the bottom, and
dark brown to red sand heaped over it.
The skeleton was badly
eroded and was not recovered.
At a depth of 122 cm. below present ground level, a dark
gray, lens-shaped deposit of ash and carbonized wood was observed.
This feature (4) was defined as a deeply buried hearth or fire
pit.
A radiocarbon date of A.D. 770 ±50 (TX2404) was obtained
on charcoal from Feature 4.
No cultural materials were associated
with the feature, nor was it possible to discern an intrusive pit
outline above the ash line.
At present it is impossible to
determine if Feature 4 is a result of human activity or natural
events.
Feature 6 was the final cultural feature examined at M411.
It consists of a small, shallow (23 x 10 cm.), basin-shaped
hearth excavated from the upper part of Level 2 into Feature 2
(Fig. 11-14).
Cultural remains observed in the dark gray, ashy
fill of Feature 6 included Et Paso Brown sherds and several small
fragments of worked chert.
The feature was badly eroded and did
not contain sufficient carbonized material for dating.
M4l1 has been defined as an apparent short-term late
Mesilla or early Dona Ana Phase habitation site.
It is quite
extensive, is relatively undisturbed and has been shown to con­
tain well-preserved subsurface features.
No definite house
remnants were observed but it seems likely that M411 does con­
tain buried pit houses.
The greatest importance of Site M4ll,
"The Profile Site," lies in its exhibiting of evidence relating
to recent sedimentary history and climatic reconstruction (see
Part III, page 124).
SITE M410 (Escondida Site)
This site consists of numerous discrete concentrations of
fire-fractured rock, lithic artifacts and debitage, ceramic
sherds and ash; several distinct rectangular disconformities or
mounds suggesting structural remnants; and an extremely dense,
site-wide scatter of ceramic sherds and lithic debris.
Numerous
large refuse middens and shallow pits or depressions are visible
in the badly deflated central portion of the site.
A substantial
amount of vandalism and relic hunting has occurred at M410 as

SITE M410

31

evidenced by numerous pits and trenches within the site peri­
meter.
At the time of its r~cording M4l0 was defined as a
large, El Paso Phase village site.
The site is located in the sandy lowlands of the northern
basin.
A large intermittent stream course or wash lies 1 km.
south of the site.
Relict channels indicate that this water
course at one time lay closer to the site, and has probably
shifted its direction a number of times.
The site location
offers no vantage point or shelter from adverse weather condi­
tions.
Sediments on the site consist primarily of a light gray,
fine-textured silt intermixed with brownish and reddish sand.
The site is currently being covered along its southwestern peri­
meter by semi-stable, red sand dunes.
Definition of site area
was greatly complicated by shifting sand dunes and ridges, but
an area of approximately 12 acres can be delimited.
Because of the limited time span available for testing M4l0,
work was concentrated on a large rectangular concentration of
cultural materials (Feature 1) thought to indicate a house
remnant.
This feature had recently been disturbed by relic
collectors, and it was felt that limiting our test to disturbed
portions would yield valuable preliminary data, while limiting
our own adverse s~te impact. Given the vast extent and obvious
complexity of M4l0, it was determined that controlled testing at
a level beyond our current means was necessary to adequately
sample the site.
Consequently our objectives were limited to
testing for the depth and character of deposits in this part of
the site, to clarifying the relationship of a specific class of
surface features to suspected subsurface structural remnants and
to an attempt to obtain some well associated material for radio­
carbon dating of at least one major cultural feature at the site.
Testing was initiated by carefully removing and screening
the fill from the disturbed portion of Feature 1.
This effort
demonstrated that Feature I was actually a structural remain
when a hard-packed adobe floor was encountered at 30 cm. below
present ground surface.
A large number of sherds, lithic
artifacts, charcoal, and many human skeletal fragments were
recovered from the disturbed fill, suggesting that a burial had
been removed from the feature.
The irregular excavation was
cleared of fill and the exposed portions of the adobe floor were
swept and examined for features.
A large, circular (50 cm. in
diameter) burned area, lying directly on the packed adobe floor,
was noted near the northeast corner of the structure.
This does
not appear to represent a prepared hearth area and may be assoc­
iated with the vandalism of the site by relic collectors.
Near
the center of the disturbed portion of the structure a large,
irregularly shaped sub-floor pit was observed.
A few human
skeletal fragments and ceramic sherds were recovered from the
obviously disturbed fill within the feature.
The feature is
defined as an apparent burial pit which had been recently
vandalized (Fig. 11-15).

TEST EXCAVATIONS

Two small depressions were noted in the adobe floor of the
structure, just east of the aforementioned pit.
The first is an
irregular, shallow concavity scooped out of the adobe floor and
may be a result of the activity of vandals.
The second depres­
sion proved to be an even, circular (23 cm. in diameter) pit con­
taining a fill of mixed soil and charcoal.
The feature is 28 cm.
deep and is defined as a probable post hole formed by a roof
support or brace of some sort.
The large amounts of charcoal
and ash observed within the disturbed portion of the structure
indicate that it was probably destroyed by fire.
A circular, ringed hearth or vessel facet and a rectangular
(30 x 19.5 cm.) metate facet were observed near the southern
edge of the disturbed area.
Both features contained an obviously
disturbed fill of ash, charcoal fragments and light gray silt.
The hearth or vessel facet consisted of a perfectly circular
depression (20 cm. inside diameter x 14 cm. deep) set into the
adobe floor of the structure.
A thick (9 cm. wide x 5.5 cm.
high) rounded ring of packed adobe surrounds the central depres­
sion.
The interior surfaces of the central depression and ring
are extremely smooth and show no evidence of multiple firing Or
heating.
The floor of the depression is markedly concave and
smoothed.
The feature is defined as an apparent potholder or
subfloor facet for a round-bottomed ceramic vessel.
This may
have served as a repository for meal ground on the adjacent
metate.
A rectangular trough metate of gray diorite of the
precise dimensions as the rectangular depression was discovered
on the back dirt at the southern edge of the relic hunters'
excavation.
The metate had been recently smashed with a heavy
hammer or pick.
After cleaning the disturbed portion of the structure of all
back dirt, the walls of the excavation were carefully troweled
and examined for features.
Five small circular (8 cm. in dia­
meter) concentrations of burned wood were observed in the western
wall of the pit.
These features were evenly spaced 30 cm. to 37
cm. apart along the length of the profile, and were assumed to be
burned roof members or cross-beams which had fallen to the floor
of the structure.
Examination of the north and east profiles
revealed the existence of extremely compacted adobe wall rem­
nants.
In this portion of the site the walls averaged approxi­
mately 35 cm. thick by 19 cm. in height.
It was apparent that
both wall sections had been badly damaged by the original e~ca­
vat ion of the area.
A north-south baseline was laid out just west of the dis­
turbed portion of the structure.
Test Unit I, a 2 x 2 m. test
square, was positioned adjacent to the apparent vessel facet
in the southern portion of the site.
Excavation was by arbi­
trary 10 cm. levels and was intended to provide information
about the character and depth of an undisturbed area of the
structure.
Test Unit I reached a depth of 28 cm. below the

present surface before any artifactual material was encountered.
Above this depth the fill consist~d of a horizontally-bedded
deposit of gray silt and reddish sands.
The structure of the
extremely thin horizontal bands indicate a filling of the
structural depression by eolian deposition.
At a depth of 28.5
cm. below the present surface, numerous small fragments of char­
coal and gray ash became visible.
Careful removal of these fine
sediments revealed a roof beam or crossmember lying directly
upon the packed adobe floor of the structure.
The timber mea~
sured 40 cm. along its exposed surface by 9 cm. in diameter, and
was oriented northwest by southeast.
Several sherds of EZ Paso
PoZychrome and Chupadero B/W ceramics lay on the packed floor
of the structure in direct association with the apparent roof
member.
A radiocarbon assay of this undisturbed timber yielded
a date of A.D. 1260 ±70 (TX2341).
In an effort to discover the dimensions of the revealed
house structure or room, the wall remnants observed in the north­
eastern portion of the original excavation were exposed and
traced.
The four corners of this nearly square structure were
located and cleared.
The exposed structure measured 9.4 m.
east-west x 8.4 m. north-south.
On the north, west, and south
sides of the feature, the walls averaged 35 cm. in thickness by
30 cm. high.
The northwestern and southwestern corners abut
each other directly and appear to be terminal exterior corners.
The eastern wall of the structure is considerably thinner (ave­
raging 20 cm. in thickness) than the other three walls, and abuts
the northern and southern wall remnants indirectly, suggesting
an interior partition rather than an exterior wall (Fig. II-16A).
All of the walls exhibited remnants of a fine-grained, gray,
interior plaster layer ranging from I cm. to 2.5 cm. in thickness.
Time limitations and severe weather precluded further testing of
Feature 3.
The limited test excavations carried out at M410 demonstrated
that a particular class of surface features does correspond to
well-preserved structural remnants; yielded data on the character
and depth of sediments in the portion of the site; and provided
a radiometric date for a particular structure and ceramic series
in one portion of the site.
Feature 3 is defined as a single
domicilary room in an apparent rectilinear room block, dating
from the El Paso Phase.
At present it is impossible to determine
the exact number of such buried remains at M4l0 but an examina­
tion of visible surface features (Fig. 11-17) and evenly spaced,
suggestive vegetational disconformities on aerial photographs
(Fig. II-16C) indicates that they are very numerous.
The data
from our limited tests support the original definition of Site
M4l0 as a major sedentary village site with numerous buried
structures, and a variety of well-preserved special activity
loci.

SITE M482
The site consists of an extr~mely dense, widely distributed
scatter of ceramic sherds, lithic artifacts and debitage, irre­
gular concentrations of fire-fractured rock and low mounds pos­
sibly indicating buried structural remnants.
It is located on a
low alluvial terrace in the sandy lowlands of the southern basin,
directly opposite the mouth of a major draw draining the Hueco
Mountains.
Concentrations of cultural material are visible over
an area of at least 3 sq. km., but the prese~ce of shifting sand
dunes and ridges in various portions of the site make accurate
perimeter definitions nearly impossible.
The most common sedi­
ment observed on the site consists of a very fine-textured, gray
silt.
In most areas this is overlain by recent reddish sands.
All cultural material at M482 was observed to occur in inter­
dune hollows on a gray silt hardpan, rather than on the dunes
themselves.
The site has been severely damaged by construction
activities and roadbuilding associated with the development of
the main McGregor Launch Facility.
In addition, heavy deflation,
sheet washing and relic collecting have adversely effected por­
tions of M4B2.
The site was initially recorded as a major El
Paso Phase habitation area, probably containing the material
remains of several-separate villages.
M482 was examined near the end of our limited testing period.
Since the broad extent and apparent complexity of the site
called for a more comprehensive program of controlled testing
than was permissible under the limitations of the project, our
objectives were limited to carrying out a more intensive surface
examination and collection and to a brief test of a single
feature.
This effort was intended to aid in more accurately
defining the area of occupation and to provide preliminary data
on the character and depth of fill in one portion of the site.
A single 1 x 3 m. test trench was excavated in Feature 5,
a roughly circular (4 m. in diameter) concentration of ceramic
sherds, lithic artifacts, ash and fire-fractured rock near the
center of the visible occupation area.
Excavation was by arbi­
trary 5 cm. levels.
Level I consisted of a light gray, fine­
textured silt, mixed with darker gray ash.
Numerous ceramic
sherds, pieces of fire-fractured rock, and lithic debitage were
observed in Levell.
Below 5 em., a compacted deposit of red/
brown sand was observed to a depth of 50 cm.
No cultural r~mains
of any type were observed below the Level I!Level 2 interface.
The feature was defined as an apparent deflation-related concen­
tration of mixed cultural debris.
Primary stratigraphic context
for these remains has been destroyed in this area of the site.
The onset of inclement weather conditions precluded further
testing at M4B2 .

SITE M362

SITE M362*
Although not in the strict sense a "test excavation," a
mention regarding the recovery of archeological materials
from Site M362 is appropriate here.
Site M362 consisted of
two complete ceramic vessels of EZ Paso Polychrome type
(Fig. 11-26), discovered in a very small overhang in the
Sacramento Mountains near the extreme northern boundary of
the Range.
Because one of the vessels was exposed, a de­
cision was made to collect it.
In the process of removal
an immediately adjacent jar was discovered and also col­
lected.
This recovery exhausted the potential of the tiny
overhang for yielding other cultural material.
Both vessels were full; eolian material and the products
of local bedrock weathering were visible at the top.
The
finds were taken to the laboratory of the Texas Archeological
Survey in Austin and, because of the obvious possibility that
they contained material of interest, were x-rayed by Dr. D. L.
Hamilton, conservator of the Archeological Conservation
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.
This attempt
at "previewing" the contents was moderately successful in that
a few of the denser items contained in one of the jars regis­
tered on the film.
The vessels have been subjected to "micro-excavation"
and their impressive contents inventoried.
Both proved to be
literally almost full of prehistoric ornamental items: many
thousands of marine shell beads and pendants of various shapes,
several shell bracelets, rock crystals, worked turquoise beads
and pendants and other items.
The proper reporting of this
find to the research sponsors will require much more time and
effort.
A detailed study is currently in progress.
Much of
the archeological value will probably be derived from identi­
fication of the marine shell and rock type source areas.
At
this writing, four marine shell species have been identified:

GZycymeris macuZates~ OZivella
and Nassarius sp.

dama~

Vermetus centequadrus,

It is clear that this "cache" will generate information
useful in future regional or extra-regional studies.

DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF PROJECTILE POINTS
MiahaBZ R. BBakBS
INTRODUCTION
One of the most commonly observed and readily identified
artifact classes on McGregor Range are projectile points.
This
category of bifacially worked artifacts includes large specimens
thought to have been hafted to short spears or darts, as well as
smaller, lighter examples thought to be arrow points.
A total of
126 complete or nearly complete specimens were recovered to facil­
itate our assessment of the range of styles represented in the
study area and possibly provide relative chronological data for a
number of sites or site components.
For the purposes of preliminary description and analysis,
these artifacts have been divided into 45 descriptive taxons.
Most of these categories are based on such attributes as length,
width, thickness, outline, and technique of manufacture; and
should be viewed merely as convenient classes. Whenever possible
the resemblance of the McGregor specimens to well-defined types
from adjacent portions of New Mexico or surrounding states is
noted.
This process was easy in the case of the small collection
of the highly distinctive FoZsom points.
This isnoe to imply
that temporal or functional conclusions about projectile varie­
ties from other geographical areas necessarily hold true on
McGregor Range, or that any direct cultural connection is indi­
cated.
The details of functional and stylistic changes in pro­
jectile points in this part of New Mexico are poorly known, par­
ticularly for the pre-ceramic periods.
At present it is difficult
to determine what effect the factors of cultural conservation and
cultural lag may have had on projectile point stylistic develop­
ment within the study area.
The following descriptive information is intended primarily
to characterize this small collection of surface finds 'in terms
of morphologi~al attributes.
Provenience is by site only; no
multiple occurrence of a given category at a single site is noted.
Measurements given (examples and/or range of measurable specimens)
indicate lengths, widths and thicknesses, in that order.

DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF PROJECTILE POINTS

CONCLUSIONS
A broad variety of projectile point styles is represented
in the McGregor Range collection.
This is thought to reflect
both the great temporal depth of human occupation of the study
area, and the effect of cultural exchange with a number of adja­
cent areas.
With the exception of a few well-defined Paleo­
indian point types, the resemblance of specific artifacts from
McGregor Range to named point types from geographically distant
areas is not considered to be indicative of direct cultural
contact or replacement of peoples.
Instead, broad similarities
between point types are believed to indicate the participation
of the occupants of the study area in geographically extensive
lithic traditions (Kelley 1959: 288); or especially for Ceramic
Period artifacts, indirect cultural exchange through trade.
The oldest identifiable point styles observed in the study
area can be ascribed to the Folsom culture (Fig. II-18a,b).
Examples recovered on McGregor Range include two complete
specimens, one point tip, and one base.
All exhibit excellent
workmanship, and are manufactured of non-local cherts.
The
specimens were all surface collected from severely deflated
contexts, usually on a strand line of a relict lake.
These
points are considered to date from ca. 8000 B.C.
Other projectile points dating to the Paleoindian period
include eight identifiable Plainview-like specimens and a
single Meserve-like type point.
The former are all manufactured
of local Hueco/Sacramento mountain chert, exhibit a high degree
of workmanship and were recovered from deflated surface con­
texts in the lower basin.
The latter specimen is manufactured
of banded novaculite chert, apparently from a source in the
Sacramento Mountains, is extremely well made considering the
intractability of the material, and was recovered near the mouth
of a major canyon in the northern part of the study area.
Projectile points very tentatively ascribed to the Archaic
Period on McGregor Range include a wide variety of morphological
types.
They can be generally characterized as being large,
usually stemmed or corner-notched, often deeply serrated, and
manufactured of nearly every variety of poor to good quality
lithic material known in the study area.
Rapidity of manuf~c­
ture and proximity of a convenient source of lithic material
seem to have been primary considerations in the production of
many of these points.
Distribution within the Range area is
apparently unpatterned; a slight majority does occur in the
foothills of the Hueco and Sacramento mountains.
The variety
of forms represented is generally similar to those reported
from adjacent portions of New Mexico, west Texas, and extreme
northern Chihuahua.

CONCLUSIONS

77

Ceramic Period projectile point styles are not well defined
in the region.
The majority of points in the present survey
collection which are tentatively assigned to the Ceramic Period
are so considered on the basis of their spatial association with
ceramics or architectural remains.
Because our observations were
primarily surficial and the ever present possibility of multi­
component materials' being exposed on the surface so likely, present
data allow little confidence in such assignments.
Generally
these specimens are small, light, often well made, and are manu­
factured of a wide variety of lithic materials.
Without exception
these appear to have been intended for use as arrow points.
Lehmer (1948) characterized the manufacture of projectile points
as a minor industry of the Mogollon of the southern Tularosa
Basin.
Generally our results bear out this idea, as most speci­
mens are fairly simple, bulbous based, stemmed varieties.
How­
ever, either cultural exchange or the presence of a few advanced
flint workers must be invoked to account for several Harretl
Toyah-like specimens which exhibit exquisite workmanship.
This abbreviated discussion of a select sample of projectile
points from McGregor Range was intended to provide basic descrip­
tive data on a variety of point types considered representative
of the study area, and to indicate the relative duration of pre­
historic human occupation of the southern Tularosa Basin.
It is
hoped that continued accumulation of basic field data will facili­
tate future intensive studies of lithic artifactual development in
the area.

ABSTRACT
An analysis is made of lithic aY'tiiacts based on theiY' min­
eY'aZogical chaY'acteY' and an attempt is made to identify the geo­
logic souY'ce aY'ea within McGY'egoY' Range of the constituent Y'aw
mateY'ials. Finished lithic tools, both chipped stone implements
and gY'ound stone utensils, weY'e gY'ouped into one of a dozen mineY'al
categoY'ies and theiY' distY'ibution plotted, 1) within each site
investigated, 2) within eite types as categoY'ized foY' this Y'e­
seaY'ch, J) within physiogY'aphic Y'egions of the Study AY'ea, 4) with­
in gY'ound-stone aY'tifact types, and 5) within chipped stone pY'o­
jectile points. On the basis of these distY'ibutions it is tenta­
tively concluded that Y'aw mateY'ials foY' aY'tifacts tended to be
locally available to the sites wheY'e the aY'tifacts weY'e found;
exceptions to this distY'ibution pY'Gfile, suggesting tY'ade netwoY'ks
OY' mobility of pY'ehistoY'ic populations, o~cuY'Y'ed most commonly in
Paleo-Indian mateY'ials.
DISCUSSION
Stone tools manufactured and used by prehistoric populations
constitute an extremely important source of archeological informa­
tion.
The analysis of these items of material culture usually in­
volves morphological description of the tools and of the debris
resulting from their manufacture.
This results in information
concerning tool use as well as tool making.
The analysis under­
taken here differs in that it represents an attempt at identifica­
tion of the provenance* of lithic materials used for the tools.
*The word provenance has essentially the same meaning as the word
provenience but the usage of these two words in this report does
indicate a substantial difference in meaning.
The standard arch­
eological usage of the word provenience to indicate the physical

MINERAL TYPES AND SOURCE AREAS

This study is both a preliminary statement on the potential of
mineral analysis for leading to insights on the procurement of
lithic materials, and a complementary study to future morphologi~
cal analysis.
The apparently finished tools were separated from the obvious
manufacturing debris.
Only these apparently finished tools,
grouped on a site basis and totaling 1,924, were examined.
Each
was grouped into one of a dozen mineral categories.
Additional
examination with a lOX hand lens ~etermined whether the artifact
had been utilized, had not been utilized, or was indeterminate.
Evidence of utilization was the presence of tiny flake scars or
striations on one or more edges.
The projectile points, described
by Beckes (see page 44), were examined and each was assigned to
one of a dozen chert categories; ground stone artifacts were also
examined, but were placed into different mineral categories.
The
results of this are presented in Tables 11-2 to 6·
In Table 11-2 the utilized, non-utilized, and indeterminate
chipped stone artifacts are placed in one of 12 mineral type cate­
gories (each with a possible source area indicated) on a site-by­
site basis.
Additionally, the number of obvious cores was noted
and indicated by parentheses.
Some of these obvious cores had
been utilized; many were indeterminate.
The 12 mineral types and
their possible source areas include:
1. fine-grained limestones (micrites) of various
colors (occurring anywhere in the'MEGregor Range
area)
2. grayish to brownish cherts, some more silicious
and finer-grained than others (occurriag:any~here
in the Range area)
3. black or very dark gray cherts (occurring in
both the Hueco and Sacramento Mountains, list­
ed as anywhere in the area)
4. light pink to more reddish fusulinid cherts
(occurring anywhere in the area)
5. banded gray cherts, some very agate-like
(occurring anywhere in the area)
6. white novaculite cherts (occurring in upper
Grapevine Canyon in the Sacramento Mountains)

location of an item of material culture is adopted
here.
The word provenance is used to refer to the physical loca­
tion of the source materials of the geologically identifiable
minerals which constitute the raw material of stone tools.

7. gray veinlet cherts (occurring in a hog-backed
ridge extension of the Huecos near Orogrande)
8. yellowish-brown to dark red siltstones (occur­
ring in the Huecos near the southeastern corner
of the Range)
9. black obsidian (reportedly occurring in cobble
form in fan gravels in the lower Organ Mountains)
10. reddish siltstones (occurring in the Abo Formation
of the Otero Mesa Escarpment)
11. clear quartz (from off McGregor Range)
12. "other", a residual category which includes pri­
marily creamy buff to pinkish to reddish chert,
clearly not from the McGregor Range area.
The above categories represent a majority of the fine-grained
and/or siliceous lithic materials available to any prehistoric
population on McGregor Range.
It is possible that many of these materials were subjected
to heat prior to manufacture in order to facilitate flaking.
In­
direct evidence might include large flake scars, some greasy and
apparently oxidized specimens, and proximity of some artifacts to
burnt rock concentrations.
However, further study is required to
firmly establish pre-manufacture heat processing, its nature,
extent, and spatial and temporal distribution.
From the totals presented at the end of Table 11-2 it can be
seen that the ubiquitous gray to brown chert (4~.9% of the total)
appears to be the predominant material.
This is possibly due to
its local abundance.
The yellowish-brown to red siltstone was a
also common (13.5% of the total lithics).
Due to its extremely
localized source area, this material could prove an excellent in­
dicator of procurement travel in the Tularosa Basin. Black chert,
occurs in about 12.9% of the samples.
Both fine-grained limestones
all,(Lwhite~Ilo'laculite cherts were strongly represented.
Table 11-3 presents the distribution of chipped stone artifacts
within Site Types and within the above named mineral categories.
The most differentiated distribution was found for the sray veinlet chert; it was not found in non-ceramic complex ca~ps, non­
ceramic burnt rock loci, or rockshelters.
However, there was over­
all very little differential distribution of mineral types among
site types and, thus, presumably little preference for specific
minerals at specific activity areas as inferred by the site typology.
Additional information is obtained from Table 11-4 which pre­
sents the distribution of chipped stone artifacts within the four

MINERAL TYPES AND SOURCE AREAS

physiographic regions of McGregor Range using the standardized
mineral categories. With some exceptions, the display of the
data indicated that raw materials for artifacts tended to be
locally available to the sites where the artifacts were found.
Gray veinlet chert is the best example.
Unlike other cherts, this
material is not found in the mountains but in a hog-back ridge
(extension of the Huecos) in the middle of the Tularosa Basin.
With two exceptions, it was used in Basin sites; only two artifacts
made from this chert were found outside the Basin. Yellowish­
brown to red siltstone is another example; this mineral occurs in
the Huecos and is found primarily on sites in that area, as well
as sites in the Basin where it was transported.
White novaculite
chert was observed on sites in the Sacramento Mountains (where it
occurs) and in the Basin.
Some artifacts made of this material
were also found on sites in the Huecos and on Otero Mesa, indicat­
ing, poteptially, the extent of travel of some members of the pre­
historic population.
Limestone was found primarily on Hueco and Otero Mesa sites.
Clear quartz occurred only on Otero Mesa sites.
Reddish siltstone
from the Otero Mesa escarpment occurred primarily on Basin and
Sacramento Mountain sites.
However, obsidian (possibly from the Organ
Mountains) occurred mostly in Basin and Hueco sites, this preliminary
finding suggests-the possi~ilitJ of a bias for the material a~ong
peoples living in the southern area of the Range.
The "other" cherts
of unknown origin were found for the most part in Basin sites, a
distribution which is to be expected if this material was brought
in as a result of trade.
The ubiquitous gray-to-brown cherts,
black cherts, and banded, gray agate-like cherts seemed uniformly
distributed; but this is perhaps a result of the analytical lumping
of these categories.
Table 11-5 presents the distribution of the same chert types
among the projectile point types estab~ished by Beckes (see page 44).
The totals reveal an expectedly high proportion of the points are
made from the gray-to-brown and black cherts (46.15%), but the
white novaculite and pink fusulinid cherts are also very common.
A low proportion of points are made from yellow-brown siltstone.
Black obsidian and the miscellaneous "other" category are represent­
ed by higher proportions than a visual scan of the data would lead
one to expect.
Limestone, clear quartz, and the gray veinlet
chert are entirely absent.
Some interesting trends can be noted.
Projectile point type 1,
usually equated with Folsom, is composed of cherts from outside
the McGregor Range area, except for one small fragment of the
yellow-brown siltstone from the Huecos.
Type 11 is composed of
very black cherts with one very black obsidian specimen.
Some morphological analysis is inherent in the presentation
of data in Table 11-6.
That table indicates the distribution of
ground stone artifact types and their constituent mineral types as
they occur on each site examined.
Each artifact was assigned to a

DISCUSSION

91

category commonly reported for the area (Lehmer 1948); a total of
twelve such categories were used, including two categories for
fragments and a residual category "other ."
The categories are:
1) pestle, which could undoubtedly be further subdivided with a
larger collection (Fig. 11-22); 2) combination pestle and two­
handed mano (Fig. 11-22); 3) two-handed mano (usually ground on
more than one side); 4) smaller mano of various shapes (Fig. 11-21);
5) combination mano-metate, with a convex grinding surface on the
bottom and a concave grinding surface on the top (Fig. 11-21);
6) slab metate; 7) basin metate; 8) trough metate (Fig. 11-23);
9) metate fragment not recognizable as anyone of the preceding
three; 10) unrecognizable ground stone fragment; 11) stone ball
(Fig. 11- 21); and 12) residual "other" category, this eventually
included a fully-grooved axe (Fig. 11- 2lF), a combinationu{ano!
double-grooved arrow-shaft straightener (Fig. II-2lB), and a
small rectangular "gaming piece" which had been ground flat on all
six sides (Fig. 2lE).
The types of minerals used for these artifacts and their pos­
sible source areas were somewhat more limited than for the chip­
ped stone artifacts.
Ground stone artifacts are generally assumed
to be less portable than chipped stone artifacts, yet some of
these tools were found on sites far from their original mineral
sources.
There is a smaller range of materials suitable for
these items; included are:
1. gray diorite (occurring in the Jarilla Mountains)
2. quartz andesite (occurring in the Sacramento Mountains)
3. syenite (occurring in the Hueco Mountains south of
the Range)
4. scoria (occurring in the Carizozo lava flow far
north of the Range as well as in the northern
Jarillas and due west of the Rio Grande)
5. petrified wood (occurring in both Huecos and Sacra­
mentos)
6. micritic limestone (occurring anywhere in the area)
7. reddish siltstone (occurring in the Otero Mesa
escarpment)
Each of these is abbreviated in Table 11-5. Due to the smaller
sample than in preceding tables, trends could not be defined,
although diorite, quartz andesite,and m~crltic limestone seem
the most frequent stone found.

MINERAL TYPES AND SOURCE AREAS

It has been noted that both the various kinds of siliceous
lithic materials and their distributions ara largely unknown
for the Tularosa Basin (Human Systems Research 1973: 307). Much
the same observation can be made for the distribution of materials
used for ground stone artifacts.
Geologic reconnaissance has
shown that nodules of siliceous and fine~grained stone occur
principally in the various Permian limestone formations which form
the Sacramento-Otero Mesa escarpment-Hueco line, along with older
(Paleozoic) limestone formations in the same area.
Ground stone
artifacts were made from materials (diorite) found in the
Jarillas along with some limestones from the Sacramento-Hueco
chain and some igneous intrusives from various Hueco sources.
It seems highly likely that further intensive geologic exploration
and further subdivision of the various cherts examined could
yield more precise source areas for more categories of lithic
materials.
CONCLUSIONS
Redman has suggested a three-step program for morphological
analysis of chipped stone artifacts, to be coupled with a multi­
stage research procedure (1973: 68).
Description of lithic
materials and their source areas may be seen as a necessary
adjunct to that three-step program, valuable at each level of
analysis.
Studies of lithic materials and their source areaS
have the potential to reveal much information on the movements
of prehistoric populations. Morphological analysis produces
inferences concerning the manufacture and use of tools; material
analysis produces inferences concerning the procurement of the
original raw material.
Procurement of lithic materials in the
Tularosa Basin necessitated the movement of people to particular
lithic source locations.
Through the study of lithic materials
and sOurce areas, then, population movements or group interaction
(for instance trade relations) may be inferred. Most lithic raw
material was procured locally, but there were important exceptions.
Such exceptions can prove to be "tracers" establishing contacts
between archeological populations of different areas.
Temporal
trends in procurement can be traced by examining the distributions
of various minerals on sites dated by absolute or relative methods.
A possible trend is suggested by the lithic biases of particular
projectile point types, in which early, perhaps more nomadic
peoples used materials from off the Range, while in later times,
a possibly more sedentary group of inhabitants used more local
materials.
Procurement of lithic materials was obviously an important
prehistoric activity; study of such materials and their source
areas may yield significant data.
The manufacture and use of
lithic tools was an important activity; further study may lead to
insights concerning prehistoric human behavior.

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS
FROM MCGREGOR RANGE
Nanoy Kays SmiZey

ABSTRACT
Desoription and anaZysis was performed on the nearZy 22,000
oeramio sherds ooZZeoted on MoGregor Range.
Twenty-seven previousZy
desoribed oeramio types are reoognized in the materiaZ, and are
oategorized aooording to vesseZ shape, rim styZes, misoeZZaneous
forms and unusuaZ oharacteristics of firing and finishing.
EZ
Paso Brown sherds are treated eZsewhere (see page 263). EZ Paso
PoZyohrome is singZed out and deaZt with extensively here; infor­
mation on waZZ thiokness, paste and surfaoe oolors, surface finish­
ing, design styles, paints and geoZogioaZ oonstitutents is in­
cluded.
Post-firing modifications, i.e., worked sherds and repair
holes, are analyzed for alZ types.
A tabuZation of ceramic types
by site is made.
Using a oZassifioation of sites by type, eoo­
zone and physiographio zone, the distribution of oeramio types
within these oategories is examined.
In addition, types originat­
ing in the same generaZ geographio zone are grouped and the areaZ
extent of these groupings is deZineated.
Hypotheses are advano­
ed about these distributions.
FunotionaZ explanations for various
oeramio types and vesseZ shapes are put forward, as welZ as ideas
on the plaoe of various types and shapes in the overaZl trade net­
work of the area.
FinalZy, comparisons are made with oeramic data
gathered by others in the generaZ vioinity of MoGregor Range.
INTRODUCTION
There were 21,836 ceramic sherds collected on McGregor Range
in 1975-76 by the Texas Archeological Survey.
These represent
twenty-seven separate and previously described types, both domes­
tically manufactured and imported (Fig. II-24A,B).
The broad variety of ceramics from several areas external to
the Jornada Branch of the Mogollon demonstrates strong trading
relationships that persisted over centuries.
The Jornada Branch
has always been considered peripheral to the central core of the
Southwestern culture area, but much of the present evidence proves
129

130

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS

it to have been an integral part of a large trade system of goods.
Figure 11-25 shows both the amount of particular imported ceramic
types which were collected and their source areas. El Paso Poly­
chrome, a type indigenous to the southern Jornada Branch, is found
in most of these source areas in varying quantities, proving that
there existed a two-way exchange of ceramics (and probably of other
goods as well).
Lehmer (1948) outlined the archeological sequence of the Jor­
nada Branch on the basis of architectural styles and ceramic types.
His reasoning has yet to be disproved and will be followed here.
According to Lehmer's scheme~ the first ceramic phase in the south­
ern sector, the Mesilla Phase, lasted from approximately A.D. 900
to 1100.
New evidence from radiocarbon dates obtained on McGregor
Range extends the beginning date of the Mesilla Phase back to the
time range A.D. 700 to 800; that is, assuming the appearance of
brownware to mark the beginning of the Mesilla Phase.
Lehmer states that ceramic types characteristic of the Mesilla
are derived mostly from the Mimbres region of the western Mogollon.
El Paso Brown, a coarse, local relative of Alma Plain, dominates
the assemblages; and the forerunners of El Paso Polychrome (the
El Paso Bichrome styles) begin to appear as indigenous types. Mim­
bres area types can, but do not always, appear.
Examples of these
types are: Mimbres Boldface and Classic Black on White, Mimbres
Corrugated, San Francisco Red and Alma Plain.
The ensuing Dona Ana Phase (ca. A.D. 1100 to 1200) represents
a transition between the Mesilla Phase and the fullblown assemblages
of the later EI Paso Phase.
Characteristically, sherds of the El
Paso Brown and Polychrome types represent over half of the total
sherd count for collections from the area. However, traces of the
Mimbres types, with the exception of Mimbres Boldface, continue to
appear.
New types which are found on Dona Ana Phase sites are:

Chupadero Black on White, Three Rivers Red on Terracotta, San
Andres Red on Terracotta and St. Johns Polychrome. These latter
types indicate a substantial broadening of the sphere of inter­
action and trade on the part of the Jornada peoples.
On EI Paso Phase sites (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400) an even greater
indication of interaction with outside areas is found.
El Paso
Polychrome is the dominant ware, up to 98% of the ceramic collections
consists of sherds of this type.
However, new types, from north­
west Chihuahua, begin to be found in substantial numbers.
Other new
new types include: Seco Corrugated, Lincoln Black on Red, Tucson
Polychrome, Gila Polychrome, Agua Fria Glaze I and Arenal Glaze
Polychrome. Chupadero Black on White, Three Rivers and San Andres
Red on Terracotta, St. Johns Polychrome and Mimbres Classic Black
on White continue to appear in these sites.
In addition to the types cited by Lehmer this research recorded
other types, including: Three Circle Red on White (an early Mimbres
type), Reserve Plain Corrugated and Tularosa Patterned Corrugated
(from the Reserve area of west central New Mexico), Galisteo Black
on White (from the northern Rio Grande area) and Ochoa Brown Smudged

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS

Indented (from southeast New Mexico).

It is apparent that the
lower Tularosa Basin was receiving ceramics from each of the sur­
rounding areas which produced ceramic goods (Fig. 11-26).
Categorizing the collected sherds according to widely recog­
nized ceramic types was a major problem in this research.
There
is much difference of opinion as to type definitions and identifi­
cations, regardless of the fact that Southwestern ceramics are
well-studied. Experts from the Laboratory of Anthropology at Santa
Fe, New Mexico State University (Las Cruces), -the Centenni~l ~useum
(EI Paso), the EI Paso Archeological Society, the Amerind Foqndation
(Dragoon, Arizona), and the University of Arizona in Tucson, were
consulted for their opinion on many identifications.
Qualifica­
tions have been mentioned whenever they were deemed necessary (see
below: Type Descriptions and Analysis). EZ Paso Brown and PoZy­
ahrome, the two types assumed to be indigenous to the area of
McGregor Range, were singled out for intensive study. EZ Paso Brown
is not analyzed in this section, but is the subject of a separate
analysis (see page 263). EZ Paso Polyahrome is covered in as much
detail as time and resources would allow.
Tree-ring dates were used whenever possible to date particular
ceramic types (Breternitz 1966). Very few types have been really
well-dated with tree-ring data, so co-occurrence with other ceramic
types and architectural styles, radiocarbon dates, and judgement
about the temporality of particular types were all used to produce
a time chart for the ceramics (Table 11-36).
Lehmer's scheme of phases for the Jornada Branch was used in
deSignating phases for each site; the ceramic data collected on the
Range did not present a serious challenge to Lehmer's formulation.
New work by DiPeso et al. (1974) may revise some of the current
ideas on the role and dates of Casas Grandes ceramic types present
in the Tularosa Basin, but this will probably refine, rather than
revise, Lehmer's phases, which are loosely constructed.
Much more work is needed before we have an accurate idea of
the time span of EZ Paso Brown and PoZyahrome, the ceramic types
most basic to our understanding of the EI Paso expression of the
Jornada Branch.
These types appear to have been extremely long­
lived and geographically localized; more radiocarbon and tree-ring
dates in association with technological information on physical
constituents and surface finishing should help to define their
place in Jornada Branch prehistory.
TYPE DESCRIPTIONS AND ANALYSIS
In this section the ceramic data is arranged by type.
Technical
descriptions of these types are not provided but are referenced in
the discussion of each type. No attempt was made to define or
redefine each type, although comments on construction and finishing

EL PASO POLYCHROME

137

EL PASO POLYCHROME (Figs. 11-26 to II-3D)
EZ Paso Polyah~ome is thought to be indigenous to the southern
Tularosa Basin (Lehmer 1948: 46).
It is not yet clear whether this
ceramic type was manufactured allover the entire southern Basin
or only in particular centers.
Its presence in heavy quantities
both at sites in and out of the Basin (and as far away as Casas
Grandes and the Mimbres Valley) argues for widespread manufacture
and/or trade.
DiPeso (personal communication) believes that this
type may have served as a "tin can" of prehistoric trade; the large
size of the standard-sized Et Paso Polyah~ome olla, its thin walls
and less-than-careful decoration suggests a large, cheap, light­
weight, and disposable vessel which was possibly used in conjunction
with a trade commodity such as pinyon nuts.
Pinyon nuts are bulky,
lightweight, and would not spoil over long periods of time.
The
presence of many Chihuahuan ceramic types from the Casas Grandes
area furthers the idea of active trading with that region.
In
order to explore these possibilities, and also to add to the gener­
ally poor knowledge of EZ Paso Polyahrome, the following analysis
was performed.

Stallings 1931
Dates
"There is no indication for the beginning date of El Paso
however, the tree-ring evidence is in agreement with
Hawley's (1950) statement that it lasted until A.D. 1350" (Breter­
nitz 1966: 74).
Lehmer states that bichrome and polychrome styles
began to evolve out of EZ Paso B~own in the Mesilla Phase, or
sometime before A.D. 1100 (Lehmer 1948: 76).

Method of Analysis
In separating El Paso Polyahrome from El Paso Brown, the de­
finite presence of paint (either red, black or both) or smudging
on a sherd was a prerequisite for typing the sherd as Potyah~ome;
by this definition the type should probably be called 'El Paso
Painted.' The paints used on El Paso Brownware are extremely
fugitive and, in addition, small sections of a Potyahrome pot are
painted with only one color. Consequently, it was impossible to
separate bichrome and polychrome styles on the basis of sherds

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS

138

alone and bichrome styles are, of necessity, lumped with polychrome
styles.
Since one-third to one-half of an El Paso Polychrome jar
is painted and the rest is not, it is certain that there are many
sherds from Polychrome vessels which were included in the El Paso
Brown category. Since the exact number is impossible to calculate,
the reader should remember that the number of EZ Paso Polychrome
sherds is a great underestimation. We did not categorize all
sherds as El Paso Polychrome when there were PoZychrome sherds
present at a site, so as not to mask the presence of true unpainted ~
EZ Pa80 Brown vessels. We are fairly certain that the great majority
of El Paso PoZychrome rims are painted.
On the basis of this
assumption, we ascertained the presence of unpainted EZ Paso Brown
vessels at the site by the presence or absence of unpainted rims.
Wall Thickness
From each lot of EZ Paso PoZychrome collected, the thickest,
the thinnest, and a randomly chosen sherd were selected for measure­
ment.
This gave a wall thickness range of 1 mm to 10.5 mm. and a
mean of 4.81 mm. (based on 353 cases).
Stallings reports normal
wall thickness to vary from 4 to 6 mm. (1931: 4).
Paste Colors
Virtually all sherds exhibited black or gray cores such as
result from incomplete oxidation during firing.
Surface Colors
Surface colors of red-brown, brown, light-brown, and gray were
noted. Due to the high carbon content of the clay, incompletely
oxidized atmosphere during firings, and varying but generally low
firing temperatures, all of these colors are possible and normal.
Often several different colors were noted on one sherd.
The black­
ened appearance of many surfaces can be due to incomplete oxidiza­
tion during firing, smoke clouds from firing or use, or, paint
applied deliberately to the surface.
Indeterminate blackening was
seen on 485 sherds, or 15% of the total number.
Jar sherds have
more blackening than bowl sherds, 74% vs. 26%, perhaps reflecting
the general ratio of jar to bowl sherds.
Interiors of sherds tend
to have less blackening than exterior surfaces:

~f

this is a meaningful difference, it could result from firecloud­
ing on the exteriors of vessels from use in cooking fires.
Smudg­
ing was seen in a total of 31 cases; it was noted on both interior
and exterior surfaces of jars and bowls.
Surface Finishing

c

El Paso Polyahrome sherds show every kind of surface finishing except slipping.
Some surfaces are self-slipped (this layer
of cl~y was chipping off), many are simply scraped and smoothed,
and quite a few are polished.
Painted surfaces are always polished.
Many sherds are badly weathered, and the surface finish has been
obliterated.
Polished surfaces, however, have resisted weathering
because the clay was compacted during manufacture.
In general,
surfaces which would be visible (the interiors of bowls, exteriors
and just inside the rim of jars) have been given careful surface
treatment, whereas other non-visible areas (the interiors of
jars and exteriors of bowls) are often cursorily scraped, causing
incompletely obliterated coils.
Polishing marks are usually quite
easy to see, because they show up as parallel striations.
These
have a marked tendency (when they show at all) to be horizontally­
oriented on the interior surface of a sherd and vertically-oriented
on the exterior surface of a sherd.
The black paint onEl Paso
PoZyahrome sherds polishes to a higher degree than does the red
paint or the natural brown clay.
Design Styles

Design styles were recognizable on 74% of the El Paso Poly­
ahrome sherds; the remaining 26% did not have identifiable designs.
Of the identifiable design styles, 95% were stripes or linear
motifs, i.e., Design Style No.1 (Fig. 11-28); other identifiable
designs are illustrated in Figure 11-29. Designs which have not
been illustrated are:
1. No. 33. red or black areas separated by an unpainted
line (10 examples)
2. No. 34. checkerboard pattern (6 examples)
3. No. 35. large blocks of painted areas (5 examples)
4. No. 36. dots or spots (1 example)
5. No. 37. indeterminate, paint is visible but a design
cannot be discerned (775 examples)
Black Banding
In order to ascertain whether or not all/El Paso Polyahrome
rims are painted with black bands just below the rim, a study was
made of black banding on rim sherds.
Sixty-five percent of all the
rim sherds are painted with black bands, 15% of all sherds have
interior bands, 17% have exterior bands, and 32% have both interior

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS

and exterior bands. More sherds may have been decorated with these
black bands, but weathering can easily have obliterated the traces.
Paint Analysis
The red and black paint on El Paso Polychrome sherds was analyzed
to determine its constituents. Six sherds were tested and in all
cases iron paint was found.
Geological Analysis
One sample sherd from "village" site M410 was submitted for
constituent analysis to our geological consultant. He reports the
presence of volcanic rock fragments in the paste of this sherd.
These volcanics definitely do not originate on McGregor Range.
This
information suggests that at least some El Paso Polychrome was not
made locally, but was imported to the site where it was found.
Further
analysis on more sherds is necessary to better understand the origin
areas of El Paso Polychrome and its role in the ceramic complexes
found on McGregor Range.
Description of Rim Sherds
Eighty-three percent of all the jar rim sherds are represented
in Figure II~}OH,M,N,P,R,S and T (Types 8,11,12,13,15,16 and 17).
This group of rim shapes probably belongs to the very large El Paso
Polychrome ollas such as can be seen in museum collections. There
is a dramatic difference in the mean orifice diameters of the steep­
sided bowls and the shallow bowls (Fig. 1I-30C,D). This may reflect
a functional difference.
It is clear that even though jars by defini­
tion have restricted orifices, the jars represented in this collection
of rim sherds possess larger openings than do the bowls.
This infor­
mation indicates a ceramic complex of very large jars and small to
medium-sized bowls.

TWO-COIL HANDLE
Oval in cross-section (reminiscent of Chupadero B/W handles)
(Fig. II-27F).
This handle is attached to a jar body
sherd.
The coils are crudely smoothed together and the
division between the coils is re-emphasized ~y a tool­
impressed line.
The handle is 4 cm. wide, 1 example.
A HOLLOW SUPPORT (1)
This could also be part of a hollow figurine or incense
burner (Fig. II-27D).
It is shaped in a cone, the broken
surface at the top is angled. suggesting that it was
attached to the side-bottom of a vessel at that point.
The sherd is 5.6 cm. tall at maximum height. Black
stripes are painted lengthwise on the exterior surface
(1 example).
A LUG

(1)

This sherd is a flat, "tongue"-like piece of molded clay,
measuring 3.8 cm. by 2.1 cm. by 1 cm. (Fig. 11-27 C).
It
is broken off as if it were a projection which attached
perpendicularly to a vessel or another ceramic object.
MINIATURE BOWL
This is a tiny, shallow bowl, measuring 5.8 cm. in dia­
meter.
The interior is painted entirely in-black'lines
(not illustrated).
COMPLETE JARS
Two complete jars collected in a rockshelter/cache (Fig.
1I-26A,B) both have rim style 11 and are basically the
same shape. Both have been excavated and were found to
contain great amounts of worked shell, bone, quartz
crystals, and turquoise. Pot A shows traces of a tied­
on cover~ probably made of woven material; caliche was
deposited around the strings just below the rim, leaving
the marks of lacing.
Both pots, although protecte~ by
the rockshe1ter, were exposed to weathering and con­
sequently show areas of pitting on their surfaces.
Slight traces of red and black paint are visible near
the rims of these vessels; in neither case is a design
discernible.
There are indications of a handle; the
analysis of these jars is continuing (see page 39) and
the possibility exists that they may have originated
outside the El Paso region.

EL PASO POLYCHROME

Notes on Construction and Firing
Three fine-tempered, light-brown sherds were found which may
be Jornada Biahrome.
A bowl rim was found which has an unusual
"pinched-in" rim at one point.
One ttshoulder" sherd was found;
it exhibits the typical recurvature of many El Paso PoZyahrome
jars.
Post-Firing Modification
Fourteen rim sherds and two body sherds show repair holes and
seven sherds show signs of having been worked (see below: Post­
Firing Modifications).
Summary Statistics

EZ Paso PoZyahrome constitutes 15% of all ceramics collected
for this survey.
Bowl sherds are very difficult to identify ac­
curately, so it is assumed that the count of bowl body sherds is
an underestimation.
Jar body sherds often exhibit recurvature and
are therefore easier to identify.
In general, rim sherds are a
better key to the ratio of jars to bowls and are used here as an
index.

This type was traded extensively into the lower Tularosa Basin
from the Cedarvale expression of the Jornada Branch; Gran Quivira
Pueblo is considered the type-site.
It is generally believed to
have been manufactured in the vicinity of southern Torrance County
and eastern Socorro County, New Mexico.
Kelley has recently sug­
gested that it had a more widespread manufacture; it occurs in
such substantial quantities (20 to 30% of the total pottery complex)

in the Sierra Blanca regions that this seems likely. However, the
type is relatively uniform, suggesting a limited center or centers
(Kelley 1966: 171). Kelley is at th~ present time performing
minerological tests upon samples of Chupadepo B/W in order to
determine its place or places of manufacture (Kelley 1976 personal
communication) •

Dates

"Chupadero Black on White begins at A.D. 1150 and lasts until
at least 1400, with the tree-ring evidence strongest between 1250
and 1400.
Since this paper is not concerned with the post-Spanish
contact period, no comment shall be made on the end date of about
1675 shown by Smiley, Stubbs, and Bannister (1953: 58)" (Breternitz
1966: 72).
Geological Analysis
One sample sherd from "village" site M410 was submitted for
constituent analysis to our geological consultant. He reports
that one volcanic rock found in the paste of this sherd originates
in the Malpais region around Carizozo, New Mexico.
Description of Rim Sherds
TYPE 1.

Jar: slightly tapering towards rim, outcurving (Fig. II­
32A). One example was found with a handle attached just
below the rim on the exterior.
This rim shape closely
corresponds to the rim shapes of many whole Chupadero
vessels seen in collections today-these are commonly re­
ferred to as Chupadero B/W "jugs", "pitchers", or "jars".

Notes on Construction and Finishing
Ten flat disk bases from jars were found, as well as 13 flat
disk bases belonging to bowls.
Toulouse and Stephenson discuss disk
bases in their report on excavations at Pueblo Pardo (1960: 39).
This ki~d of base is unique in southwest pottery. Nine bowl sherds
exhibit wide, flattened coils just below the rim on the exterior of
the vessel.
These coils are evidently part of a band of corrugations
left unsmoothed for decorative purposes.
One rim sherd exhibited
a series of vertical indentations just below the rim on the exterior
(Fig. II-3lJ).
Several sherds a~e smoothed on their unpainted
surfaces; this variety of Chupadero B/W is occasionally referred to
as Casa Colorado Blaok on White (Mera 1935), but is not considered
as a separate type for the purposes of this report.
The Chupadero B/W material from McGregor Range conforms with
Kelley's description of slipping: "Contrary to Hawley (1936: 67)
the presence of slip was not essential. When present, slip varied
from chalky white to cream to gray" (Kelley 1966: 241).
There may
also be present on some sherds the finishing technique known as
"self-slipping" or "floating".
Great variation in the technical
execution of painted designs was noted: some painting is extremely
careless while other examples show great skill.
On many sherds the
black paint tended to glaze.
It is not known whether this is a for­
tuitous event or whether a glazed paint effect was attempted only
on occasion or, when attempted, only partially achieved.
Post-Firing Modification
Five sherds showed repair holes and 39 showed signs of
having been worked.
Summary Statistics

Chupadero BZaok on White constituted 7% of all the ceramics
collected.
Of the imported ceramic types, it is by far the dominant
type, making up 56% of the total.

THREE RIVERS RED ON TERRACOTTA

165

THREE RIVERS RED ON TERRACOTTA (Figs. II-31 and 11-33)
This type originates in the northern Tularosa Basin from 10
miles south of Alamogordo to north around Corona.
Vessels were im­
ported into the lower Basin area in fairly substantial numbers
(along with related types San Andres Red on Terraaotta and LinaoZn
Blaak on Red) in the Dona Ana and EI Paso Phases.
Temporally and
morphologically Three Rivers RIT overlaps to a great extent with
San Andres RIT.
In fact, it may be more useful to consider them
together, although there is reason to believe that San Andres RIT
preceded Three Rivers RIT temporally.
In this research the two
types were distinguished on the basis of paste coior, surface color,
painted line width and size of temper.
San Andres RIT tends to be
browner in color, have broader painted lines and coarser temper.
Three Rivers RIT has more orange in the paste and surface color,
has thinner painted lines and finer temper.
However, none of these
criteria were inviolable.
The combination of factors was taken into
account in dividing sherds into these categories.

Dates
liThe tr.ee-ring evidence is insufficient to comment upon the
beginning date of this pottery type, but there is a suggestion that
it lasts until around (A.D.] 1350.
Since the tree-ring associations
are poor, the Smiley, Stubbs, and Bannister (1953: 58) dates of
[A.D.] 1150 to 1300 are probably the best available" (Breternitz
1966: 97).

JORNADA BROWN
Jornada Brown represents a variety of localized brownware that
developed out of the western Mogollon brownware tradition (Mera 1943).
It is often difficult or impossible to distinguish from El Paso Brown
or other related types since all of these types intergrade.
For the
purposes of this study, Jornada Brown was distinguished from EZ Paso
Brown on the basis of finer temper and paste texture, the presence
of self-slipping, polishing, and finer surface treatment in general.
It can have Et Paso Brown-type paste, and its generally brown color
can vary. However, the combination of several of these factors
served to distinguish obviously Jornada Brown sherds from the great
mass of Et Paso Brown sherds.
It represents a link with areas to
the north of the southern Tularosa Basin.

type occurs at a site occupied about 1350 11 (Breternitz 1966: 79).

MIMBRES CLASSIC BLACK ON WHITE (Figs. 11-27

t

11-31', & 11-32)

Mimbres CZassic BZack on White originated in the Mimbres Valley
area and may also have been manufactured by colonies of Mimbres
peoples located in the western part of the Jornada Branch (Lehmer
1948: 71).
It began to be imported into the Tularosa Basin in the
Mesilla Phase and reached its peak in the DaDa Ana Phase.
There
was still some of this type imported into the Basin in the El Paso
Phase.
The presence of so much Mimbres Classic B/W in the Tularosa
Basin indicates heavy trade with that area of the western Mogollon.

Notes on Construction and Finishing
One sherd shows paint on the exterior surface and not on the
interior surface.
This is possibly a jar sherd.
Another shows
white slip on both sides with some red paint on the exterior.
This
may be a rare example of Mimbres PoZyahrome.
Several other examples
exhibited slipping and painting on the exterior as well as the in­
terior surfaces of the sherd.
Paint colors ranged from black to
brown to red, depending on the temperature achieved in firing.
Sherds with red paint also have a red-colored paste.
Slip was ob­
served to sometimes wear off in layers, indicating the application
of several coats of clay in the manufacturing process.
Slip wears off
of the surface of the sherd more easily than does the black paint,
frequently resulting in sherds with traces of paint and no slip.
Post-Firing Modification
Six sherds showed repair holes and 22 showed signs of having
been worked.

The 42 examples of White Mountain Redware collected on McGregor
Range are difficult to classify accurately.
All of them could be
St. Johns Polychrome, and since they are unlikely to be Heshotau­
thZa or Fourmile PoZychrome due to the late dates for these types,
they will be considered as St. Johns polychrome.
All four of these
types fall into Lehmer's El Paso Phase, so phase designation is not
altered if the type is misidentified.
St. Johns Polychrome is
commonly found as an intrusive type allover the southwest.
It
originates in an area within a radius of about 50 miles of St. Johns,
Arizona.

(Figs. 11-27 and 11-32)

Atma Ptain is the oldest brownware known in the southwest New
Mexico region.
This type includes much variation and can be expected
to intergrade with other brownwares.
Therefore, its identification
can at times be difficult and tenous.
Lehmer states that it was
part of a core of Mimbres pottery types which were imported into the
Jornada area in the Mesilla and Dona Ana Phases (Lehmer 1948: 77),
and Mera postulates that it was a coarsening of Atma Ptain which
gave rise to Et Paso Brown and Jornada Brown (Mera 1943: 12).

MIMBRES BOLDFACE BLACK ON WHITE (Figs. 11-27 and 11-32)
This early Mimbres Valley pottery type, also called Mangas
Blaak on White, is occasionally found in the Tularosa Basin. With­
out whole vessels or rim sherds, however, it is often difficult or
impossible to differentiate late Mimbl"es Botdfaae B/W from Mimbl"es
Classia B/W. It is possible that instead of Mimbl"es Classia develop­
ing gradually out of Boldfaae, they coexisted for a period of time
as separate types with different functions.

RAMOS POLYCHROME (Figs. 11-32 to 11-34)
According to Lehmer, the Chihuahuan Wares began to appear in
the southern Tularosa Basin in the El Paso Phase (Lehmer 1948: 81).
New dates given to these types by DiPeso et al., however, may change
the beginning date of this phase to a point sometime earlier. Ramos
Polychrome began to be manufactured in the Media Period (A.D. 1060
to 1340) which corresponds to Lehmer's Mesilla Phase.
It remains
to be determined whether or not trade with the Casas Grandes peoples
in Chihuahua began at this time or at a later date.

TUCSON POLYCHROME (Figs. 11-32 and 11-33)
Although this ceramic type is generally known as Tuason PoZy­
ahrome when found in the Tularosa Basin, Mera and others note that
it only superficially resembles Tuason PoZyahrome.
The type is a
finer and more finished product, with a fine-textured, tan-colored
paste; it is not known how this type relates to ordinary Tuoson
poZyohrome (Mera 1943; 15).

EL PASO BROWN (TOOLED AND CORRUGATED VARIETIES) (Fig. 11-27)
The 8 EZ Paso BrOWn Tooled and Corrugated sherds recovered are
treated in this section rather than with the analysis of El Paso
Plain Brown (see page 263) because of their decorative surface treat­
ment.
With the exception of surface treatment, El Paso Plain Brown
sherds resemble the sherds reported here in every way.
References Consulted
Lehmer 1948
Dates

El Paso Brown, Tooled and Corrugated are assumed to have
the same dates as El Paso BrOWn, ca. A.D. 800 to 1350.
Notes on Construction and Finishing
Two sherds show wide, parallel strokes incised into the
exterior surface.
Two sherds show obliterated corrugations (they
are probably from the same vessel).
One sherd exhibits rows' of
punched marks.
One sherd (worked) shows a pattern of parallel
strokes arranged in a spiral design.
Post-Firing Modifications
One specimen shows signs of having been worked (see

GILA POLYCHROME (Fig. 11-33)
Gila PoZychrome was thought to have come from the area of the
Mogollon Rim south to the Gila River in the Middle Gila area; evidence
from Casas Grandes has shown that this type most likely originated in
the Casas Grandes region.
It is probably safe to assume that the
GiZa PoZychrome found in the southern Tularosa Basin came in trade
from Chihuahua along with many other pottery types in the El Paso
Phase.
References Consulted

Dates
"Although I acknowledge the present evidence for beginning

GiZa poZychrome at 1300, I believe future work may show that this
type begins between 1250 and 1300.
Recent work with tree-ring material
from Casas Grandes indicates that GiZa PoZychrome occurs earlier in
northern Chihuahua than in the Southwestern United States.
In fact
it may be a type which was introduced into the Southwest from the
Casas Grandes region (DiPeso 1976).

UNIDENTIFIED PLAIN SHERDS (not illustrated)
Unidentified plain sherds constitute 1% of all ceramics collected
on the Range.
At least 123 different vessels are represented in
this collection.
Two of the specimens represent a kind of oblit­
erated corrugated that one occasionally finds as far west as Point
of Pines.
It probably occurs most frequently in the Cloverdale
complex of southwest New Mexico (Haury, personal communication).
Two other specimens have heavily scored interiors of the kind that
one usually finds on Chupadero BZaak on.Whits.
On the basis of this
technological detail it may be assumed that these sherds represent
a plainware associated with Chupadero BZaak on White (Haury~ person­
al communication).

REPAIR HOLES
There were 28 sherds which exhibited repair holes (excluding
Rims have
a tendency to crack because they are a point of weakness on a ce~
ramic vessel.
But, if small holes are drilled on either side of a
crack and a string drawn through them and tied, the crack can be
kept from spreading. The holes were drilled with pointed tools,
probably wooden or bone awls, usually from the exterior of the
vessel.
They were finished by drilling away the remaining material
from the interior surface. Holes ranged from 2.5 to 8 mm. in
width.
In cases of rim repairs, they were usually drilled about
1.5 to 2 cm. from the edge of the rim.
It did not seem reasonable to assume that these holes were
used to suspend the vessels, as has been suggested in the past.
They are generally too small and too close to the edge of the rim
to function as suspension holes. No sign of wear was observed on
the edges of any of the holes.
Repair holes were found in the following ceramic types:
El Paso PoLychrome (14 rims, 2 body sherds)
Three Rivers Red on TeI'I'acotta (2 rims)
ChupadeI'o Black on White (1 rim, 2 body sherds)
MimbI'es CLassic BLack on White (3 rims, 2 body sherds)
San Francisco Red series (1 rim)
AZma Plain (1) (1 rim)

El Paso Brown sherds); 22 (79%) of these are rim sherds.

WORKED SHERDS
A worked sherd is one which has been shaped by grinding, after
firing and breakage. An analysis was performed on 73 worked sherds
(there were, in addition, 54 worked sherds of El Paso Brown).
In
the past worked sherds, found in the Southwest, have been called
counters, pendants, tools, or else have not been assigned a func~
tion name.
In most cases the specimens have been triangular, rec­
tangular or disk-shaped, often with perforations.
There were only
3 sherds found on the Range which were completely worked on all
edges; they are roughly rounded and have no obvious function.

POST-FIRING. MODIFICATIONS

201

The majority of the worked sherd collection from the Range
have been interpreted as scrapers or shapers; a tool used in the
manufacture of ceramic vessels.
By and large these artifacts do
not have regular shapes but do exhibit worn facets along one or
more edges. These characteristic wear patterns are fully consis­
tent with use as tools for pottery manufacture.
In describing the wear patterns, the term facet refers to the
worked edge of the sherd as seen from either surface. Bevel denotes
the angle of the facet, either on the exterior or interior surface
of the sherd.
See Figure 11-35 and-its caption-for both- illustra­
tions and descriptions of the various types of worked sherds.
Of all the wear patterns,. A was by. far the most common.
Chupadero BZack on White sherds, because they are harder and finer­
grained than other types of sherds, are more steeply beveled. El
Paso Polychrome is quite friable and its worked surfaces are gener­
ally round or flat.
All of the sherds were about 3.5 to 6 cm. wide,
a size which is easily held. Many of them had more than one facet
or, as in wear patternB, were used by the potter at more than one
angle. Potters probably used several different sherd tools in
fashioning one pot; the different surfaces to be shaped would de­
mand differently shaped tools.

T* Trace
By comparing the number or worked sherds of each ceramic type
with the total number of sherds found on the Range of that type,
an indication of preference for specific ceramic types to be used
as tools was found.
Chupadero Black on White and Mimbres BZaak on
White are represented in higher percentages than would be expected
if worked sherds were randomly distributed among all types.
Un­
doubtedly the greater hardness and strength of these pottery types
was an advantage to the potter using sherds for tools. El Paso
Brown and Polychrome are underrepresented in the collection of

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS

FIGURE 11-35.

Types Of Worked Sherds

a. Convex facet, exterior bevel. This potsherd exhibits a
convex facet, beveled on its exterior surface. This would
result from the potter holding the sherd at an angle with
the fingers on the concave or interior surface and the thumb
on the exterior surface; as a scraping motion is performed
towards the body on the interior of the vessel, the observ­
edwear pattern results.
b. Convex facet, flat or rounded edge surface.
The flat wear
pattern is achieved by holding the sherd at a 90° angle to
the interior wall of a clay vessel while shaping or scraping.
A slightly rounded surface would result if the tool were
used at a slight angle on either side of the facet.
c. Convex facet, interior bevel.
This wear pattern would result
if the sherd were held in the opposite manner from that of
example A and used,as in example A, to shape the interior
of a vessel.
d. Convex facet, interior and exterior bevel.
Both sides of
the ceramic tool were used in shaping the interior of a
vessel.
e. Concave facet, exterior bevel. The ceramic tool is held
as in example A, but it has been used to shape the exterior,
convex surface of a clay vessel.

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS

It can be postu.lated that there is a higher probability of
finding ceramic. goods manufacturedata large, multi-component,
multi-feature site (such as village Sites} than at smaller, sing1e­
component, single-feature sites.
The data indicates that the hy­
pothesis may be verified. An examination of the statistics for
data from complex camps suggests thatthese$ites were also used
for the manufacture of ceramic goods.
In additi~n, the possibility
remains that burned rock loci and rockshe1ters were also the loca­
tions of some pottery-making activity. Worked sherds of the type
found on the Range, which can with a fair amount of certainty be
assigned a ceramic manufacturing tool function, have been shown to
be valuable aids in reconstructing site usage.
DISTRIBUTION OF CERAMIC ARTIFACTS
In this section the ceramic data from McGregor Range is pre­
sented in tabular form, by site.
Table 11-35 is a key to the ce­
ramic types which were identified, and is followed by a time chart
(Table 11-36) representing the time span for each type as accurately
as it is known.
The artifacts were divided into two categories,
bowl and jar sherds, and then each category was further subdivided
into rim or body sherd categories. A further explanation of rim
sherds and other forms of sherds is to be found in the section
Type Descriptions and Analysis (see page l32)t repair holes and
worked sherds are discussed in the preceding section.
If the total
number of sherds collected at any single site exceeded 100, the
percentage of each type present was calculated. Phase designations
for each site were determined solely on the basis of ceramics and
follow Lehmer's (1948) scheme for the Jornada Branch.
In addition,
tree-ring dates from Breternitz (1966) and information from several
other sources contributed to the dating process. A site with more
than one phase designation could conceivably fall into either; for
example, site Ml contains ceramic remains from both the Dona Ana
and El Paso Phases (ca. A.D. 1100 to 1400).
If the site is very
large and contains both earlier and later ceramic types, it was
considered a multi-component site.

INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY
DISTRIBUTIONS
A total of 265 ceramic sites were discovered within the survey­
ed area of McGregor Range.
Table 11-38 lists the ceramic types col­
lected and the number of sites which yielded examples of these
types; some of the closely related types are combined for this set
of statistics.

Probably a more useful way to view the occurrence of ceramic
types would be to group types by assumed geographic origin and to
examine their distribution across the Range.
The groupings used
are:

Northern Tularosa Basin wares:

One way of examining the distribution of types is to view
their association with site types devised for McGregor Range (see
Part I, Research Design); those yielding eeramies include the fol­
lowing:
I. Habitation Sites
1. Village Complex (V)
2. Complex Camp ceramic (Cl)
3. Rockshelter (R)
II. Limited Activity Loci
4. Isolated Hearth (IH)
5. Lithic Scatter (LS)
6. Burned Rock Loci ceramic (BRL-C)

10. Isolated Ceramic Scatter (IC)
11. Exotic Material Cache (X)

The local brownware (El Paso Brown and Polychrome) is
found on Virtually every ceramic-yielding site discovered
on the Range and its distribution reflects the distribution
of ceramic sites in general.
Along with the local brownware,
the northern Basin and Mimbres types are most commonly found
in complex camps.
However, the pattern for these two groups

1

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS

248

of types varies from the pattern for brownware in that their next
major concentration is in village sites.
The Chihuahuan wares,
Reserve area wares, White Mountain Redwares, and the Three Rivers
Redwares are most frequently encountered in village sites.
Of
these, the Chihuahuan wares, White Mountain Redwares, and Three
Rivers Redware groups have their next most frequent association
with complex camps.
Local brownwares exhibit their second most
frequent association with burned rock loci.
GiZa and Tucson PoZy­
chpome are not found frequently enough to form a pattern.
Another meaningful pattern emerges from an examination of the
distribution of ceramic groupings with respect to major physio­
graphic zones.
The zones used in this study are also explained
in greater detail elsewhere (see Part III, page 99).

INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY

249

Again the distribution of local brownware reflects essentially
the total known distribution of ceramic sites in these zones.
Local
brownware occurs most frequently in the Tularosa Basin, next in the
Sacramento Mountains, then in the Hueco Mountains, and most sparsely
in the Otero Mesa area.
The north Basin wares and the Three Rivers
Redwares also follow this pattern.
Chihuahuan wares. White Mountain
Redwares, and Mimbres wares are also most frequent in the Tularosa
Basin, but their second highest concentration is to be found in the
Hueco Mountains, and the third highest concentration for Chihuahuan
and Mimbres wares is in the Otero Mesa area (White Mountain Red­
wares were not found there at all).
Chihuahuan wares, White Moun­
tain Redwares, Gila and Tucson Polychrome were not found in the
Sacramento Mountains, whereas all other types were.

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS

types are mostly concentrated in the Tularosa Basin, but the Tucson
PoZychrome collection is so limited that it cannot be used to define
a pattern.
Another useful distribution to examine is the ceramic group­
ings compared to defined ecozones (Table 11-41); these zones have been
designated after Wyatt 1976. All of the ceramic groupings were
recovered most frequently in the sand dune/mesquite ecozone, which
corresponds with the Tularosa Basin physiographic zone. The Chi­
huahuan, Mimbres, Local, Reserve and White Mountain Redwares were
found in their second highest frequency in the alluvial fan/creosote­
bush zone, and their heaviest concentration occurred in the foot­
hill draws/yucca-grasslands.
This pattern of concentration is
parallel to the pattern of concentration for all ceramic sites in
those areas. However, the reverse is true for the North Basin
wares and the Three Rivers Redwares; they were more likely to be
found in the foothill draw/yucca-grasslands than in the alluvial
fan/creosotebush regions. Again, GiZa and Tucson Polychrome were
found too infrequently to form a recognizable pattern.
A DISTRIBUTION OF BROWNWARE-ONLY SITES
A special study was made of sites on which only brownware (El
Polychrome) was observed or collected. The dis­
tribution of these sites in relation to site type, physiographic
zone and ecozone was examined. It was hypothesized that such
sites may have some special function which may be revealed by ex­
amining their locations and configurations.

Paso Brown and

Site Type
Of the brownware-only sites 54% are classed as complex camps,
26% are burned rock loci with ceramics, 7% are rockshelters, 6% are
isolated hearths, 4% are lithic scatters, and 1% are isolated
mortars and ceramic scatters.
This corresponds fairly closely to
the general statistics of the number of sites which fall into these
categories with the exception of village sites; all of the observ­
ed village sites had brownware as well as other types of ceramic
deb ris .
Physiographic Zone
Forty-four percent of the brownware-only sites were found in
the Tularosa Basin, 21% in the Sacramento Mountains, 18% in the
Hueco Mountains, and 17% on Otero Mesa. These figures do not vary
dramatically from the over-all percentages of ceramic sites which
occur in the physiographic zone categories.

-----~

INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY

251

Ecozone
Forty percent of the brownware-only sites are in the sand
dune/mesquie zone; 21% are in both the alluvial fan/creosotebush
and foothill draw/yucca-grasslands zones; 11% are found in the mesa/
grasslands; and 7% are in the mountairi canyon/pinyon-juniper zones.
A higher percentage of brownware sites are found in the sand dune,
mesa and canyon sites than are found in the alluvial fan and foot­
hill draw sites.
It is not known whether these variations form a
significant pattern.
Generally speaking, brownware-only sites seem to be randomly
dispersed among ceramic sites on McGregor Range.
Village Complex
sites are never brbwnware-on1y sites; but other than this, the num­
ber of brownware sites within the analytical categories set up for
this study, i.e., site type, physiographic zone, and ecozone, seem
to be proportional to the number of ceramic sites found in each.
This would suggest that sites yielding brownware-on1y ceramic in­
ventories do not represent special function sites.
Perhaps these
occupational residues date to a different, possibly earlier, time,
AREAL DISTRIBUTION OF CERAMIC TYPES ON McGREGOR RANGE
By placing map pins of different colors (each color represent­
ing a type or group of typesl on a large map of the Range, it was
possible to visualize the areal distribution of ceramic types,
Ceramics examined included Mimbres BZack on White (BoZdface and
CZassic) , Chihuahuan wares, Chupadero Blaak on White, White Moun~
tain Redwares, Three Rivers Redwares, and Brownware-on1y sites.

Chihuahuan Wares
These are commonly found in the lowland Village Complex sites
of Quadrat II and in the Hueco Mountains.
They are uncommon else­
where except along the Sacramento River in Quadrat VI.
They are
not found at all in Quadrat IV (the Northwest Sacramento Mountains).

Chupadero BZack on White
Of the imported types, this type is the most widely distributed,
often it is found as a sole accompaniment to brownware.
It is found
commonly in Quadrats I, II, IV and VI.
It is rarely found in Quadrat
III (the southern lowland dune sites) and not at all in Quadrat V
(Otero Mesa).
White Mountain Redwares
These types are found most commonly associated with other im­
ported types such as Chihuahuan wares, Three Rivers Red on Terra­
aotta and Chupadero Blaak on White in Quadrat I and II. They are
not found at all in the Sacramento Mountains, on Otero Mesa or in
Quadrat III.
Three Rivers Redwares
These redwares are found commonly in Quadrat II and in the
canyons of the Sacramento Mountains (Quadrats IV and VI).
They
are not found in Quadrat V (Otero Mesa) or Quadrat III (Lowland
dunes), and are not very common in the Hueco Mountains.
These
types are found associated with other imported types, but are not
as common as Chihuahuan wares, Chupadero Black on White or Mimbres

BZaak on White.
Brownware-only Sites
There are many of these sites in each quadrat surveyed, but
Quadrat II is unique in that it features these sites almost ex­
clusively.
Quadrat I (the Hueco Mountains)
This quadrat contains all the major types found. and-includes
many sites with Chihuahuan wares.
The sites in this area yie~ded
almost as much variety in the ceramic collection as the lowland
Village Complex sites of Quadrat II; but none of the sites in
Quadrat I contained as many types as the sites in Quadrat II.

INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY

253

Quadrat I I (the northern lowland dunes)
This Quadrat encompases the area of the major Village Complex
sites on the Range.
The entire assemblage of imported and domestic
ceramics occurs in these major sites.
Quadrat III (the southern lowland dunes)
This area differs dramatically from Quadrat II; the majority
of the sites are brownware-only but in a few cases the brownware is
accompanied by Chupadero BZaak on White.
Quadrat IV (the Sacramento Mountains)
This area contains many brownware-only sites as well as sites
with a variety of ceramic types; however, the lack of Chihuahuan
wares is notable.
Quadrat V (Otero Mesa)
This area contains mostly brownware-only sites; however, there
were not many ceramic sites encountered on the Mesa and in its can­
yons.
Quadrat VI (Sacramento Mountains)
The distribution of ceramic materials in this area is similar
to that found in Quadrat IV with the exception of the canyon of the
Sacramento River.
A wider variety of ceramic types, including
Chihuhuan wares, is found there.
CERAMIC TYPE FUNCTIONS
With some of the ceramic types more commonly found on the Range,
it is possible to make reasonable assumptions regarding their use
or function.
Such interpretations concerning function depend on the
formes), vessel size(s), and frequency of occurrence of particular
ceramic types.
However, "absolute" judgements can not be made;
many types of vessels were probably multipurpose.

EZ Paso PoZyahrome
This type is probably an all-purpose utility and culinary ware;
jars outnumber bowls and the large ollas were possibly used as trad­
ing containers.

Chupadero Btaak on White
These "jugs lf are widespread in the study area; sometimes this
is the only ware found with EZ Paso Brownware.
This suggests the

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIAL

254

probable usefulness of Chupadero Btaak on White as a container for
fetching and storing water.
In addition to jugs, bowls are also
found and may have served for short-term storage or as culinary ware.

Mimbpes Classia Blaak on White
All specimens of this type were bowls and were probably used
for short-term storage or as culinary ware.
The fact that these
bowls were trade items and beautifully painted on their interior
surfaces may have given them a certain importance above and beyond
vessels of other ceramic types; some special purpose is suggested.

Three Rivers Red on Terraaotta
All specimens of this type were bowls and were probably used
for short-term storage or as culinary ware.
Chihuahuan Wares
All specimens of this type were jars; they may have been used
for storage (short or long-term) or for food preparation.
VESSEL TYPE FUNCTION
As with interpretations of ceramic type functions, vessel types
which cross-cut ceramic types can be interpreted as to use.
Again,
these interpretations are open to modification and debate; they are
presented merely as suggestions of possible functions.
Large Jars or Ollas (El Paso Polyahrome)
These vessels were probably used for long or short-term storage
of gathered or cultivated vegetal goods, water, or other liquids.
They were also traded to other areas, although that may have been
the result of their use as containers rather than as trade items
pep see These vessels may have been used in cooking.
Jars (All Types, excluding Mimbres Blaak on White, Three Riveps

Red on

Terraaotta~

White Mountain Redwares)

These vessels were probably used for many different purposes,
including water carriers, containers for long and short-term star
age of dry goods and liquids, and food preparation.
Two EZ Paso
Polyahrome jars .ere found in a rockshelter-cache; they Were filled
with shell beads, bone, crystals, and turquoise.
Chupadero BZaak
on White jugs probably served as water or liquid containers; their
small orifice diameters and accompanying handles suggest a pouring
function.

INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY

"Seed Jars"

(El Paso

255

Chupadero Black on White)

These vessels were probably used in much the same way as the
other jars; but they don't have necks and are more difficult to
hold and pour from, so they may not have been designed as liquid
containers.

Bowls (El Paso

Polychrome~

Bowls are not well suited for storage or carrying liquids;
they may have been used for short-term storage, for example during
food preparation.
They were probably used as eating vessels (see
also Mimbres Classic Black on White) and possibly as cooking vessels.
In the El Paso Polychrome collection there are two different groups
of bowls, one type has steep sides and a large orifice diameter;
the other type is shallower and has a more restricted orifice di­
ameter.
It is possible that these two types of bowls functioned
differently.
It is of interest to note that vessels imported to the lower
Tularosa Basin from the west and north include many bowl forms.
In fact, only bowl sherds were found for several types (Mimbres
Classic Black on White~ White Mountain Redwares and Three Rivers
Red on Terracotta).
Chihuahuan wares, which make up more than 5%
of all imported wares and are the only ceramics imported from
south of the Basin, are exclusively jars.
It seems likely that
particular types were specialized to certain forms, and that the
trade was organized around these specialties.
For instance, the
prehistoric inhabitants of the Range area may have relied upon
the makers of Chupadero Black on White for water jugs at a par­
ticular time in their history.
They may also have imported Mimbres
Classic Black on White bowls especially for ceremonial offerings
at another time.
All of this is pure speculation; however, the
fact that specialization in exchange was present remains highly
probable and aspects of associated behavior may be determinable
by way of further ceramic studies.
COMPARATIVE DATA
Comparisons with the ceramic data obtained from sites in the
general vicinity of the Range suggests that our sample was suf­
ficiently large and extensive to have recovered examples of almost
all types previously reported from the region.
A number of types
are so sporadically found in the area (for example, Tucson Poly­
chrome and Galisteo Black on White) that it is not surprising that

ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS

256

they were lightly represented in our sample from McGregor Range.
Several types were expected, but not found.
These specifically
include Agua Fpia Gl~zs .I~ Apsnal GZ~ze PoZyahr.ome~ Huer.igos
Polyahr.ome~ Ramos Blaak~ Car.r.stas Polyahpomeand Babiaopa Potyahr.ome.
Agua Fr.ia Glaze I and its re~ated polychrome, Ar.enaZ Glaze PoZy­
ahr.ome, date to around A.D. 1300 to 1425 (Breternitz 1966: 91).
Agua Fr.ia is known to exist in traces on the Escondida Site (M410),

but was not collected on our survey.
The same is undoubtedly true
of the other types mentioned above.
Ceramic types found by the
MCGregor Range Survey, but until now not reported for the area,
are Thr.ee Cir.aZe Red on White~ S~ao Cor.pugated (newly named and
probably the same as Lehmer's Smudged Corrugated), Reser.ve Plain
Cor.pugated~ Tulaposa Indented Corrugated~ Mata Red on Brown and
Pilon Red on Blaak. Some of these were probably found earlier,
but designated with other names or as "unidentified."
Comparisons as to proportionate amounts of all these types
are made difficult for several reasons.
First of all, the defini­
tions of types are often confusing and inconsistent.
This is
understandable since reports on the ceramics of the lower Tula­
rosa Basin began to appear in the early 1930's, before terminology
and definitions were well established.
Secondly, opinions as to
controversial types and varieties render the data inconsistent.
For example, most workers cannot agree on the dividing lines be­
tween the various plainwares of the Jornada Branch; this is in­
evitable when there are no distinct divisions for these types.
Thirdly, survey data is always subject to the inconsistencies and
vagaries of the individual collector.
Rarely is one site collected
in a manner fully consistent with another, and more rarely are the
sites of different surveys collected in the same way.
Consequently,
no attempt is made to compare raw statistics on ceramic types
between the McGregor Range Survey and other investigations in the
region.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The preceding analysis was performed with the goal of making
a valid contribution to the interpretation of Jornada Branch
archeology.
In many ways it was achieved; significant information
was obtained on a variety of aspects of the lives of the prehis­
toric inhabitants of the McGregor Range area.
Two radiocarbon
dates in association with ceramic sites helped to anchor occupa­
tions and ceramic assemblages in absolute time (see Table 11-37
data on Sites Ml03 and M4l0).
In addition, our data on particular
types of ceramic assemblages helps to seriate the ceramics of the
area and ultimately helps to refine the cultural sequence.
Trade
relationships with other areas have been identified and quantified,
at least as far as these relationships involved the exchange of
ceramic goods.
All but two of the ceramic types identified in
the survey (El Paso Br.own and PoZyahrome) are known to be

----

INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY

257

manufactured outside of the area of the Range; they indicate that
the trade network was geographi,:eally largQ and p:r;obably .quite
ac ti va.
Us ing a clas s if-ica tion of sites by type, ecozone, and
physiographic zone, the distribution of ceramic types within these
categories was e~amined.
This method helped to identify what are
probably areas of different types of occupations, meaningful either
temporally, functionally, or both.
The probable function of par­
ticular types of vessels and ceramic types was explored, with in­
teresting results.
Finally, the simple description of the ceramic
remains themselves has given us a fuller idea of the variation
within types, the relationships between types, and the technological
methods used by the prehistoric potters.
The information-yielding potential of prehistoric ceramics
from the McGregor Range area is without a doubt very substantial.
Not only are ceramic sherds among the few remains to be found on
an archeological survey of the area, but they provide an important
key to dating sites and occupations, understanding the sphere of
interaction of the peoples who occupied the sites, and interpret­
ing the activities of these peoples.
The ceramics of the South­
west are particularly well-studied and understood, aiding the re­
searcher in unravelling their meaning.
However, much work needs
to be done on the typological and technological analyses of ceramics
in the area of the Jornada Branch.
These kinds of studies, as well
as controlled surveys and excavations, can increase our knowledge
far beyond what it is today and begin to answer some of the many
questions we have about the archeology of this area and past
extra-areal relationships.

INTRODUCTION
The archeological reconnaissance of McGregor Guided Missile
Range resulted in the recording of 258 ceramic period sites, of
which 85 exhibited only the undecorated pottery type: EZ Paso
Brown. One of the few possible approaches to the study of a
widely-distributed, undecorated pottery lies in the analysis of
the methods and materials of manufacture; and this preliminary
study is basically an attempt to delineate some of the tech­
nological parameters of this plain brownware.
The go&l of this
paper is to demonstrate, through the preliminary analysis and
the research design derived from it, the scientific potential
inherent in a common cultural item such as plain brown potsherds.
There was considerable uncertainty concerning the relation­
ship between El Paso PoZychpome and E'l Paso Bpo~n.
It was sus­
pected that El. Paso Pol.yahrome was merely a painted version of
EZ Paso Bpo~n and that mineralogical analysis would reveal no
differences in sherds from the same village.
Additionally, the
range of firing temperatures used by the prehistoric ceramists
*see footnote,

page 83.
265

266

EL PASO BROWNWARE

was sought as necessary technical knowledge.
A technological
analysis was done to check the rather remote possibility that
plain brownware was manufactured from distinctive mineral
sources outside the area.
The question of the homogeneity of source materials of
brownware types arose early.
If local in origin, could sherds
be differentiated on the basis of the mineralogical constituents?
Could specific localized mineral sources for specific brownware
sherds be isolated?
It was suspected that brownwares were manu­
factured in village or habitation sites only, and that the brown­
wares of each village could be distinguished and identified on
the basis of their mineralogical constituents.
Tying different
brQwnwares to specific villages (points of manufacture) was a
major advance goal of the technical analysis.
Through the isolation of specific points of manufacture, it
was hypothesized that various kinds of relationships between
various kinds of sites might be clarified.
The brownware pro­
duced by the population of one particular village should also
occur on specialized activity sites (quarries, plant processing
sites, animal processing sites, horticultural sites) occupied
on a seasonal basis by that particular population.
Seasonal
sites exhibiting brownware from more than one village would imply
contact between the inhabitants of those villages, possibly of
a seasonally cooperative nature.
The presence of the brownware
of one village at another village would elucidate the extent of
travel and village-to-village contacts across the Tularosa Basin.
Shifts in relationships between populations over time could be
traced by examining the brownwares of village sites assigned dif­
ferent dates on the basis of intrusive ceramics and/or radiocarbon
dates.
Implicit in these advance questions were certain assumptions
concerning Formative culture in the Tularosa Basin.
Lehmer (1948)
established the Jornada area as a branch of the Mogollon cultural
tradition, one of the cultural traditions which culminated in the
historic Rio Grande Pueblos.
It was assumed that pottery-making
techniques ethnographically described for the various pueblos
(Guthe 1925, Stevenson 1904) were descended from and thus repre­
sentative of techniques used by earlier peoples, such as the
Mogollon.
Stevenson (1904: 373-377) and Guthe (1925: 19-22)
report that clay sources for each village remain the same from
generation to generation.
Kelley (1966: 199) states that a~most
all villages "produced some locally-made brown pottery." On the
basis of these reports it was assumed that each village had its
own clay source in the area of the village, and that pottery was
made only in these habitation sites.
One assumption was that
clay sources across the Basin are sufficiently mineralogically
diverse to permit identification of individual sources on a site
by site basis.
Not all of these assumptions were found to hold
true.

267

METHODOLOGY
As mineralogical analysis of every brownware sherd collected
from every site on the Range was obviously not feasible, 13 sites
were selected (non-randomly) to provide a representative cross­
section of ceramic remains from the Range.
More sites were
selected from the Tularosa Basin than any other physiographic
zone of the Range as most of the recorded sites occured in this
area.
Due to the fact that sites from the southern portion of
the Range were more heavily collected than sites from northern
areas, most of the Basin sites selected were from the central
and southern areas.
This bias for the southern sites dictated
selection of a greater number of sites from the Hueco Mountains
than from the Sacrament os or from Otero Mesa, since relationships
between village and seasonal sites were more likely to be illu­
minated in a representative sample of these sites.
Sites chosen included M481, M377, M4l0, MIOS and M213, which
are known and suspected village sites in the Basin, as well as
M310 and M75 which were, apparently, seasonally-occupied sites.
Site M25 was chosen from the Huecos, as well as MI03, a small
rockshelter which yielded radiocarbon dates in association with
brownware in a stratified context.
Two sites from Red House
Tanks Canyon in the Huecos were also selected, M73 (apparently
earlier) and M88 (apparently later in date).
From Otero Mesa
MIOO was chosen, and M249 was chosen from the Sacramentos, both
apparently camp complexes.
One painted and three plainware sherds were taken from the
collection made at each of the above named sites.
Thin-section
slides were made of each sherd at the Mineral Studies Laboratory
at Balcones Research Center, Austin, Texas.
As a means of
determining the basic mineralogy and petrology of each specimen,
the thin-sections were analyzed petrographically and by x-ray
diffraction.
The detailed mineralogy revealed by the x-ray
technique is texturally explained by the petrology revealed by
the thin-section analysis.
Consequently the blanks left from
the thin-sectioned sherds were mounted and subjected to x-ray
diffraction analysis utilizing a General Electric XRD-3 dif­
fractometer.
Resulting diffractograms were interpreted with the card
files compiled and updated by the American Society for Testing
Materials (1957).
For detailed presentation of the revealed
min era log y , see Par t I I I, P ag e 135 f f .
Altogether, 30 sherds were analyzed by x-ray diffraction
and with the petrographic microscope.
Twenty-six sherds repre­
senting 13 sites (including the ten sampled for the petrographic
and mineralogical analyses) were subjected to refiring tests to
determine the original firing temperature of plain brownware.
Each sherd was broken into two parts; its exterior, interior
and core colors were determined by comparison with the Munsell

Soil Color Chart (1961), and the degree of tightness with which
the two portions fit together noted.
One portion was left as a
control sherd, while the other was placed in an electric kiln
and heated.
Refirings started at 400°C, and proceeded in 50°C
increments to 850°C, with a final firing to 1050°C. After
each firing, the sherds were allowed to cool, removed from the
kiln, and checked against the unheated sherds for the same
degree of tightness in fit, and against the Munsell Soil Color
Chart for changes in colors.
GENERAL ANALYTICAL RESULTS
Traditionally the sole purpose of technical analysis has
been to provide the archeologist with a list of materials the
prehistoric potters used as non-plastic inclusions of the clay
body, or temper.
Shepard (1971: 53) states that lithe variety
of materials used for temper was not recognized until petro­
graphic analyses were made." Over the past 40 years such ana­
lyses have proven most useful in establishing the temper's
source area, and thus the source area of the particular type
in question.
Shepard (1971: 95) also notes that most descriptive analy­
sis is broken down into physical properties, composition of
materials, technique of manufacture and style, and of these,
composition of materials and technique of manufacture are most
important as they, to a large measure, influence the physical
properties and stylistic aspects; however, all should be con­
sidered as a whole.
For this reason, this technical analysis
was not solely concerned with temper composition, but took a
more open-ended approach.
This yielded more information on
particle sizes, major, minor and trace mineralogical constituents,
firing temperature ranges and ultimate source rocks.
All of
these factors have a major bearing on materials of composition
and technique of manufacture and thus on physical properties
and style.
Particle sizes were graded into three categories: sand
(finer than 2 mm.), silt (finer than 0.0625 mm.), and clay
(finer than 4 microns), and the percentage of each determined
for each sample.
It was expected that the clay-sized particles
would predominate, followed by silt- and sand-sized particles.
However, the reverse usually proved true.
In eight samples the
percentage of sand was 50% or greater.
In four samples a bimodal
distribution of quartz sand was observed.
Sorting was for most
sherds extremely poor (01)4.0$).
A number of implications follow on this particle size distri­
bution.
Pedogenic clay materials are typically poorly sorted.
Sorting occurs in fluvial situations, where particles are being
transported and thus have a chance to be sorted hydrodynamically.

GENERAL ANALYTICAL RESULTS

269

Pedogenic and lacustrine soils are the rule in the Tularosa Basin
(see Part III, page 115)t with o~casional eolian additions pro­
ducing biomodal sand sizes.
This indicates that the prehistoric
ceramists did not search out relatively pure deposits of clay- to
silt-sized materials (po~sibly due to their rarity), but used
locally available soil, no matter how sandy.
However, quartz
sand is a good refractory which, in the correct proportion to the
clay, was extremely beneficial in strengthening fired materials
(see Part III, page 138).
Orthoclase feldspars, plagioclase feldspar, and quartz were
the primary constituents of all samples.
Orthoclase comprised
50-95% of all samples, with plagioclase and quartz varying in
percentages from 5% to 30%.
Plagioclase was absent from eight
samples, while quartz was absent from only one.
All of these
minerals were ultimately derived from the diorites, seyenites
and trachytes common on the Range.
Although high temperature (>900 0 C) firing destroys the
crystalline identifiable structures of clay ~inerals, rend~ring
the most desirable method of clay body classification impossible,
some clays survive if firing temperatures are neither prolonged
nor very high (Shepard 1971: 153-154).
Since the firing range
for plain brownware was evidently quite low, it was possible
to determine that illite was the major clay mineral present in
most samples.
In addition to illite, clay-sized, biotite and
chlorite were also present in three samples.
Illites were
preserved where they were packed between larger grains.
This
clay mineral was often large enough to be termed authigenic
(or, due to firing).
Traces of several other minerals were found in all samples.
These minerals included biotite, mica, hornblende, perthitic
feldspar, microcline, sphene, zircon, pyroxenes, amphiboles and
muscovite; all of these had an ultimate igneous origin. Minerals
with an origin in sedimentary formations included calcite, chert,
and limestone rock fragments.
The relative abundance of igneous­
derived minerals compared to the relative rarity of minerals
derived from limestone formations could imply one of two things
either 1) brownware was made primarily on the western side of the
Tularosa Basin, where igneous minerals are more common than on
the eastern side, where limestone formations predominate, or 2)
the prehistoric ceramists avoided soils developed from limestones
in favor of those developed from igneous intrusions wherever they
were.
It is difficult to explain the reasoning behind the latter,
more probable cause for this difference.
Shepard (1971: 22, 30)
notes that the calcination process, the destruction of calcium
carbonate by heat between 650° and 898°C, results in the dis­
integration of the ceramic vessel containing calcium carbonate,
but this process is retarded by a high percentage of carbon
dioxide in the firing atmosphere and a rapid rate of heating.
As both of these factors were probably active in firing plain

270

EL PASO BROWNWARE

brownware, and as the firing temperature probably rarely exceeded
650°C. much less 898°C, destruction of pottery by calcination
does not seem the best explanation for the avoidance of limestone
and limestone-derived minerals by the prehistoric ceramists of
the Tularosa Basin.
The explanation appears to be the retarda­
tion of soil clay pedogenesis by abundant calcium carbonate
parent material on the Range.
Although a number of considerably sophisticated techniques
for determining the firing temperature range of prehistoric
ceramics now exist (Ericson 1976), the vast majority of archeo­
logists are most familiar with the older methods.
Shepard (1971:
222) states that three kinds of changes may be used to determine
firing temperatures: "changes in optical properties of the clay,
thermal changes in mineral inclusions, and changes in the physi­
cal properties of the body.1I
The thermal changes undergone by mineral inclusions include
such processes as calcination and the inversion of quartz.
Clays, too, change over a temperature rise, and illites develop
into secondary minerals such as spinels, mullites, cristobalites
and anorthites as their crystalline structure collapses under
heat (Grim 1957).
Ericson (1976: 3) has suggested that x-ray
diffraction be used to determine the extent of the latter pro­
cess, and thus the firing temperature, but he says this method
is only applicable to pottery fired lower than 500°C.
However,
Pigott shows that through x-ray diffraction one may identify
mineral assemblages which form at characteristic temperatures
up to and over l200 0 C (see Part III, page 137).
The rate of
firing, as well as the temperature reached, is a major variable
in both of these processes, with a slower rate producing a more
complete change in the clays and/or mineral inclusions.
Pue­
bloan firing techniques result in a rapid rate of temperature
rise (Shepard 1971).
Several high temperature minerals were detected: spinel,
mullite, anorthite, and cristobalite.
These appear to indicate
a firing temperature range somewhere between 950° and l250 o C.
It is very possible that these minerals were already present in
the soil matrix when it was collected by the prehistoric potters
and are not a result of the decomposition of clay minerals.
Accordingly, it was deemed necessary to run the refiring tests
in the manner previously described, in order to obtain an estimate
of the range of firing temperatures from observed changes in the
physical properties of the clay body.
Physical size and color are the two properties most often
tested in refiring.
Ideally, they should remain the same up to
the temperature at which the ceramic was originally fired,
whereupon colors should change and the sherd should shrink.
But
Shepard (1971: 223-224) points out several factors acting on
these changes in conjunction with the actual temperatures reached.
The degree to which the pottery was originally oxidized has a

GENERAL ANALYTICAL RESULTS

271

considerable effect on its subsequent color changes.
If poorly
oxidized, the sherd may change colors at a much lower temperature
than the original firing range due solely to more complete oxi­
dation in a different atmosphere.
Nor do all sherds shrink when
their original firing range is exceeded; some expand, due to
inversion by various minerals.
Careful estimates of the original firing temperature based
on refiring tests must include considerations of these factors.
Given the partially reducing atmosphere of Puebloan firing tech­
niques, and their generally low temperatures, shrinkage was
deemed a better criterion of the original firing temperature than
color changes.
Both were utilized in testing the plain brownware
sherds.
Color changes were observed in 24 of the 26 sample sherds
refired at soooe.
A further change in color was noted at 550 0 e
and in most sherds this color was maintained up to 800 o e, at
which point most turned slightly redder.
This unmistakable
change at 500-S50oe is undoubtedly due in part to an increase
in the degree of oxidation, but since not only the value (bright­
ness) but the actual hue itself changed (becoming redder), it is
also very likely that the original firing temperature was sur­
passed.
An unexpected color change occured in two sherds.
Between
650°C and aooGe these sherds turned a darker grayish-brown
instead of the change to lighter reddish-brown or light red ob­
served on the other sherds.
However, the refiring to BOOoe
turned these anomalous sherds to the same light red value as the
other sherds.
It is possible, since this change was seen on the
interior surfaces, that this represents the burning of some sort
of carbonaceous substance accumulated in the pores of the interior
surface due to prehistoric use.
This explanation is extremely
unsatisfying, but no otber suggests itself.
Surprisingly enough, the evidence of shrinkage turned out to
be the most difficult to interpret--precisly the reverse of what
had been expected.
Six sherds exhibited evidence of possible
shrinkage after being fired to 450°C.
One showed possible
shrinkage at soooe, five at 550 o e, two at 600 o e, and two at,
650 o e.
Seven sherds did not shrink at all, while two samples
could not pe interpreted.
Judging from changes in the physical
sizes of refired sherds, then, the original firing range could
have been 450-650 o C.
A median temperature of 550 o eis' sug­
gested by changes in the color of refired sherds.
All sherds were fired to IOSOoe in a final test.
Upon
cooling, all were observed to be cracked, slightly warped, and in
the first stages of disintegration.
This was taken as evidence
that they had been over-fired, thus setting a probable upper
limit to firing temperatures used by the prehistoric potters of
the Tularosa Basin with this clay.

RESULTS OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Comparisons were made of the samples representing the ten
sites for similarities and differences among sherds within the
sites (internally), among sherds between the sites on an areal
basis (spatially), and among sherds between the sites on a
temporal basis.
Additionally, a cluster analysis was made on a
matrix of several variables for each sample.
While several
interesting observations can be made from these comparisons, it
cannot be overemphasized that because the sample is extremely
small, such observations are of a very preliminary nature.
These comparisons can only be used to indicate possible directions
for further research; research utilizing much larger samples col­
lected consistently from more sites.
Four sites were represented by only one sample sherd (M4l0,
MI03, M8B, M25), and thus were not compared for internal con­
sistency.
Five sites were represented by only two sherds, while
only one (MIOO) was represented by three.
Two criteria were used
for comparative purposes: percentages of each particle size, and
proportions of mineral constituents relative to one another.
While all the samples from each site seemed more alike than dis­
similar to the other sample sherds from that site, some differences
were noted.
Sites M73 and M75 each had two sherds, and one sherd at each
site displayed a bimodal distribution of sand sizes, indicating
possible deliberate inclusions.
This was the only instance of
particle size differences.
Sites MIOO, MIOS, M213 and M249 each
exhibited some differences internally in proportions of mineral
constituents.
The three sherds from MIOO demonstrated the great­
est variability, one did not have any quartz, two did not have
any plagioclase, and all three possessed different forms of
calcium carbonate.
The differences within other sites primarily
concerned trace minerals.
For the most part then, the mineralogical similarities out­
weigh the differences when volcanic rock fragments are excluded.
This suggests a certain areal homogeneity, but as the MIOO sam­
ples indicate, enough differences could exist to trace different
populations. Much more work is needed to define the limits of
variability for each site sampled.
For comparative purposes then, each site was assumed to be
internally consistent.
All but two sites (M75 and Ml03) could be
assigned to only one or two phases of the Formative Period on the
basis of intrusive ceramic types (see page 207).
Sites M73 and
M249 were dated to the Mesilla-Dona Ana Phases, MIOO to the Dona
Ana Phase, M88 and MI08 to the Dona Ana-EI Paso Phases, and M213
and M4l0 to the El Paso Phase.
Sherds from earlier sites were
compared to those from later sites to see if any changes in
particle size percentages occurred over time; changes in mineral
constituents would indicate changes in source areas.
Statistically,

RESULTS OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

273

no such changes were observed.
This suggests that the prehistoric
potters were consistent in their choice of source locations for
their clays and in the methods they used to refine them.
Again assuming internal consistency for comparative purposes,
data from sites in the following areas of the Range were compared:
the northern Basin (M4l0), central Basin (MlOS and M2l3), southern
Basin (M75), Sacramento Mountains (M249), Otero Mesa (MlOO), and
Hueco Mountains (Ml03, M25, M73, and M8S).
In this comparison
the most interesting similarities and differences emerged.
Bimodality of sand sizes occured in sherds from three of the
four sites in the Huecos (M25, M73, and M88); it also occured at
M75, in the southern Basin.
Plagioclase feldspars occured in all
sherds from these sites, but were absent from most of those from
other areas.
Small amounts of biotite were noted in sherds from
M8S, M73, and M25, all in the Huecos.
Plagioclase and a trace of
biotite also occured in one sherd from Ml08, in the central Basin.
Sherds from sites to the north (M410, M249, and MlOO) were notable
in that they contained various forms of calcium carbonate, such as
calcite, biomicrite, and limestone rock fragments.
The sherds
from the two sites in the central Basin, M2l3 and Ml08, had simi­
larities in mineral constituents to both north and south.
The
three sherds from MlOO showed some resemblances to samples from
the central Basin, northern Basin, and Sacramentos.
The sherd
from Ml03 had no particular similarities to samples from any
specific area.
Such areal similarities suggest sources of raw materials
were indeed localized, recognizably so, if not at a village level
then most certainly at an areal level.
Ceramic variability seems
related to spatial constraints, although the limited sample pro­
hibits predictions as to the extent of the relationship.
The cluster analysis was run on a matrix utilizing variables
of percentages of clay, silt, and sand, maximum firing tempera­
tures, and percentages of quartz, orthoclase, and plagioclase
(see Part III, page 144).
Included in this matrix were the
results of x-ray diffraction and petrographic analysis of one
sherd of El Paso Polychrome.
The most interesting result of
this cluster analysis was the great similarity among subgroups
of plain brownware sherds as opposed to the painted brownware
sherd.
Decoration does not appear to be the only difference;
technical differences exist as well.
It is obvious that the
limi ts of variabili ty of El Paso Po lyehrome need to be. explored,
and compared with those of El Paso Brown.
El Paso Brown was formally defined as a type by comparisons
with earlier studies.
Lehmer erroneously described its temper
as profuse amounts of "angular fragments of limestone and quartz
ranging up to 1.5 mm. in diameter"· (1948: 94); the error was
perpetuated in later compilations of type descriptions (Human
Systems Research 1973: 329).
Limestone looks very much like
feldspars, and Lehmer, without the benefit of petrography, was

274

EL PASO BROWNWARE

unable to distinguish the two.
He notes that "it was undoubtedly
a native product" and further, that it appears as early as his
Hueco Phase in association with Alma Plain (1948: 74-76).
Lehmer
claims that "by El Paso Phase times, undecorated pottery had dis­
appeared from the complex" (1948: 80), but this has not proved
to be the case in later investigations.
Runyan and Hedrick (1973: 21) have considerably improved on
Lehmer's (1948: 94) type description, especially in the descrip­
tion of non-plastic inclusions.
They describe seven different
combinations of feldspars, quartz, sand, gypsum, and crushed
sandstone, with minor amounts of mica, magnetite andhgIllstite.
These materials make up 25-50% of the body.
Limestone, bone,
shell, or sherd temper does not occur.
The greater mineralogical
diversity of their definition undoubtedly reflects a sample from
a much broader area than just McGregor Range, and evidences the
possibilities of petrographic studies of brownwares.
A more localized study of undecorated brownware involved
the petrographic analysis of 11 thin-sections of El Paso Brown
sherds from village excavations at Hueco Tanks State Park, Texas
(Rogers 1975); this area is just a few miles south of the Hueco
Mountains on McGregor Range.
The analysis revealed feldspars
and quartz to be the major non-plastic inclusions, with smaller
amounts of dark minerals such as biotite and magnetite.
Per­
centages of each were very similar to percentages of the same
minerals comprising syenite porphyry, the igneous rock common to
the area (Rogers 1975: 12-13).
Rogers concludes that this co­
variation in non-plastic inclusions of El Paso Brown and locally
available minerals indicates local origin of the plain brownware,
rather than temporal, functional, stylistic, or other variation
(1975: 21-22).
Kelley states that "virtually every village site in that
quarter of the state from Pueblo I to Pueblo IV produced some
locally-made brown pottery" (1966: 199).
She terms plain brown­
ware Jornada Brown, a Typological designation first introduced
by Mera (1943: 12).
Runyan and Hedrick (1973: 21), as well as
Human Systems Research (1973: 329), note that tempering materials
are the same for Jornada as El Paso Brown, but smaller in size.
Kelley states that "temper may~Offer the best tool.for identifying
geographical variants and localized manufacturing centers in a
type that otherwise presents such a monotonous face to the world"
(1966: 168).
Kelley's work centered around the Sierra Blan~a
region, north and east of McGregor Range, but much the same could
be said for more southerly plain brownwares.
Indeed, Jelinek
states that "Lehmer's description of an El Paso Brownware does
not seem sufficiently different to distinguish El Paso from
Jornada Brown, and the two are here considered as the same type"
(1967: 47).
Many workers consider this the proper view.
Jelinek
spoiled the effect, however, by defining several plain brownware
types, such as Roswell Brown and South Peeos Mieaeeous Brown~ on

RESULTS OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

275

the basis of slightly different non-plastic inclusions that
probably represent local petrological source differences only.
It appears quite possible that all plain brownwares manu­
factured from north of the Sierra Blanca region, east to beyond
the Pecos River drainage, west to the Rio Grande, and south to
EI Paso belong to only one basic type, with such minor varia­
tions as can be observed to be the result of differences in
local mineral sources.
If so, then a tremendous potential
exists for unraveling the complex and little understood rela­
tionships between these areas of southeastern New Mexico and
western Texas by mineralogical and petrographic analyses of the
brownwares found on sites in these areas.
CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS: CERAMIC MANUFACTURE
IN THE TULAROSA BASIN
The goals of a study such as this one can be numerous~
An
investigator may wish to arrive at statements regarding the
development of the technology of pottery making and focus on
questions concerning the relationship between environment and
technological change; or, an alternative set of goals may in­
volve attempts to reconstruct behavior and/or social structure
by a process of inference.
Two such methods which use inference
to reach tentative conclusions about prehistoric behavior are
the concepts which employ the notion of "mental template"
(Deetz 1967) and the principles of ethnographic analogy.
Both
of these inferential approaches are discussed here and are ap­
plied to the material at hand as a means of arriving at some
early conclusions.
The concept of "mental template" was first defined by Deetz
as "a combination of a number of attributes; these attributes
were present for reasons which were traditional, functional,
technological, a matter of innovation, or a function of the
materials used" (1967: 47).
When the mental template "is ex­
pressed in tangible form in raw material, an artifact results"
(Deetz 1967: 45).
A series of similar artifacts reflects a
series of similar mental templates held by the prehistoric
artisans.
Deetz goes on to note that archeological types~ too,
are clusters of attributes which recur in artifacts, but are
classificatory creations of the analyst for comparativ~ purposes
(1967: 51).
To him it seems irrelevant whether the analystls
I'type" corresponds to the artisan's "mental template." But to
others it matters very much, for this is one of the few possible
ways to work back, to inf'er from the artifacts the archeologist
observes, to the behavior and ideas of the prehistoric popula­
tion which produced those artifacts.
Another valid method of infering prehistoric behavior is by
analogy with the behavior of ethnographically described popula­
tions.
The uses and abuses of analogy have been discussed at

276

EL PASO BROWNWARE

length (Ascher 1961).
Agreement has emerged from such dis­
cussions concerning several conditions which increase the
validity of ethnographic analogy.
Among the conditions are
direct historical continuity, similar environments and adapta­
tions to it, and similar levels of cultural development.
Fortunately in New Mexico such conditions obtain to a greater
extent than most other regions.
There is direct historical con­
tinuity between the ethnographically described Pueblos of the
Rio Grande (as well as the Zuni and Hopi towns) and the Mogollon
and Anasazi cultural traditions which preceded them.
They oc­
cupy areas though much reduced which were occupied by the
Mogollon and Anasazi populations.
Although some change has
occured, the general environment is basically similar to that
which was extant prehistorically; and until the twentieth
century, both the prehistoric and the historic groups were
basically Formative cultures.
Analogy, then, between ethno­
graphically described Puebloan pottery manufacturing processes
and such processes as practiced in Mogollon areas (even such
peripheral areas as the Tularosa Basin) seems to be a valid
method of inference.
Finding a source of raw materials is an important step in
pottery making.
However, the process of locating clay materials
has not been ethnographically described; clay sources seem to
have been regularly used over long periods of time (Stephenson
1904: 373).
As mentioned earlier, analysis revealed only a
minor indication of spatial variation in the location of the
source areas of the mineral constituents used in Tularosa Basin
brownware; it can tentatively be assumed that, in the region
sampled for this study, the use of a single clay source was a
tradition among the potters.
Guthe (1925: 19-22) notes that the potters of San Ildefonso
take three different kinds of clay from their traditional sources.
A red clay (argillic horizon?) is removed from soft earth near
arroyos; a white clay (volcanic bentonite?) is taken from the
side of the arroyo bank; and "Apachet! clay is gathered elsewhere.
The first two clays are used for fine painted wares, but the
"Apache" clay is used for cooking pots of lesser value.
Such
utilitarian ware is unpainted and brown, and sounds quite similar
to plain brownwares from McGregor Range.
The first two clays are prepared very carefully in contrast
to the "Apachet! clay.
The raw materials are wind-winnowed ·to
remove clods and impurities by letting it drop in a light breeze;
the finer, lighter, more useable particles drift in the wind and
fall onto a blanket or cloth while the heavier particles drop
straight down.
The fine clay is then moistened and stored in
pots for a few days; Shepard (1971: 52) notes that this increases
plasticity and ease of working.
It is then mixed deliberately
with tempering materials until it is lighter in color and "looks
right II (Guthe 1925: 22).
The purpose of temper is not fully
understood.

CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS

277

Guthe (1925: 22) describes the "Apache" clay as "very different
from the two other clays used.
It is light brown in color, with
a large quantity of large mica flakes in it; it also has a dis­
tinctive odor."
It is not wind-winnowed; instead it is saturated
in water, kneaded and large pebbles and impurities removed.
It is
then spread in thin layers and smaller pebbles removed, several
times until it can be kneaded into a putty-like consistency.
The
pebbles are placed in water to dissolve the clay, which is then
used when molding the vessel.
"The most important difference be­
tween this clay and the others is that no temper of any kind is
mixed with it; the clay, after being cleaned, is used in the vessels
just as it came out of the clay pit.
The fine mica flakes prob­
ably act as temper" (Guthe 1925: 23).
This process is technologically more primitive and possibly
much older than the other.
If it. is considered to be analogous
to the preparatory process used by the prehistoric potters on
McGregor Range, many aspects of plain brownware, as revealed by
petrographic analysis, are explained.
The lack of wind-winnowing
would leave raw materials in their original unsorted condition
and explain the high percentages of sand and silt.
The distinctive
odor may be a result of a highly carbonaceous soil matrix contain­
ing much organic matter.
If such soils were selected in the
Tularosa Basin, it might offer one explanation for the large,
dark carbon streak in the cores of sherds, which took much heat
to burn out in refiring.
The apparent lack of any deliberately
added tempering materials would be connected to the lack of wind­
winnowing and the unsorted nature of the raw materials.
The func­
tion of deliberate inclusions was already performed by large
particles of feldspars and quartz which were naturally a part of
the clay.
Plasticity is a property of ceramic materials essential to
the construction of useable forms, but plasticity is reduced when
large particles are in too great a proportion to clay-sized parti­
cles.
The large proportions of sand in the McGregor Range samples
suggest that plasticity might have been a problem to the prehis­
toric potters.
Rogers (1936) notes that Yuman ceramists, faced
with the same problem of too sandy a paste, often add gummy organic
extracts to give the paste an artificial plasticity.
If this was
done in the lower Tularosa Basin, it too could be an explanation
of the orgainc inclusions.
Actual construction of the vessel followed.
The Fueblos of
today, and the prehistoric Anasazi and Mogollon potters as well,
constructed their pots by the coiling technique, the most wide­
spread pre-~heel technique (Shepard 1971: 54).
A round disc of
clay is formed and placed for support in an older, broken base.
A
rope-like coil of clay is formed and joined to the round disc and
other coils are added onto the top of the previous one until a
cylinder is formed.
The vessel form is shaped with spoons or
shapers, made of gourds or sherds (see page 200), several being
used on one vessel; Guthe (1925: 27-30) reports that each ceramist
had 4 to 15 such tools of various shapes.

Linear breaks, perpendicular to the axis of the vessel, in many
sherds (especially those from larger vessels) suggest that this was
the method followed in the Tularosa Basin. Many of these breaks
display a light slope to the interior, possible evidence that when
coils were joined, they were overlapped to the interior, and care­
fully pressed together.
This is the manner of bonding used in
San Ildefonso (Guthe 1925).
It should be added parenthetically that the ceramists of
McGregor Range did not always make vessels.
One small zoomorphic
figurine (approximately 45 mm. long by 25 mm. wide) was collected
from Site M2l3; it appears to represent a bear- or frog-like being
(Fig. 1I-36a,b).
One possible sherd bead was also collected; it
has a light gray body and a hole drilled through it (Fig. 11-36d).
In the category of unusual vessels must be included one ladle col­
lected at Site M83, possibly used for serving or for cooking as the
interior was deeply smudged (Fig. l1-36e).
After vessels broke, the
sherds were often reused as scrapers or shapers (see page 200) and
one very unusual shape is shown in Fig. II-36c.
Guthe (1925: 55) notes that after drying, the vessel is scraped
to make the walls thin and even, then the surface is moistened and
rubbed to float a thin flim of clay over the surface; at this stage
a wet cloth is used; in the past the fingers, a corncob or sandstone
were used.
Stephenson (1904: 377) states that rabbit-skins also have
been used.
The surface is then polished with a smooth stone and the
vessel is thoroughly dried.
During the last drying stage cracking
can occur, a situation necessitating the possible repair holes noted
in plain brownware (see page 200).
Firing is the final, crucial step.
Ethnographic accounts vary
the widest when describing this process.
Kilns are not used in the
Southwest; firing can be either in a pit or above ground (Shepard
1971: 75).
Fuel ranges from sheep dung at Zuni (Stephenson 1904),
to cow patties and cedar at San Ildefonso (Guthe 1925: 73), to juni­
per and coal at Awatovi (Shepard 1971: 80).
The fuel used seems to
be whatever is locally available and burns the hottest and longest.
Vessels are positioned upside down, and are often very crowded, touch­
ing one-another.
Fuel is placed around and often below then, lighted
and allowed to burn down with little or no refueling.
Shepard's
(1971: 85) observations of firing at San Ildefonso, Santo Domingo,
Zia and Cochiti indicate a rapid rise in temperature to its peak,
usually 650°C to 940°C, and then gradual cooling.
These were for
well-made decorated wares, with the lowest temperature and quickest
firing time (35 minutes) used for polished black smudged
.

wares.
Guthe (1925: 74) notes that utilitarian cooking vessels
were fired only half as long; presumably less fuel was used,
producing lower temperatures.
Degree of oxidation of the cera­
mics is affected by firing time, fuel used, method of fueling
and actual temperature reached (Shepard 1971: 82).
Finer fuels
such as woods or grass burn quicker and faster than denser fuels
such as dung or coal and reach lower temperatures.
Fireclouds,
a common firing blemish, represent differential oxidation due to
the vessel's contact with the fuel, poor draft, or too close
packing of the vessels (Shepard 1971: 92).
No evidence of firing pits was found on McGregor Range.
It
is possible that this was due to not recognizing features as
such; it is equally possible that firings took place above
ground.
It does not seem likely that sufficient dung was ever
accumulated to permit its use as a fuel.
Juniper, cedar, mes­
quit~, or even pinyon, which is very smoky, may have been used.
Possibly grasses, yucca stalks or finer materials were burned as
well.
All of these fuels would burn at a rapid rate, shortening
the oxidation period and reach lower temperatures than those
recorded for modern Pueblos.
Additionally, the shorter firings
reported by Guthe for utilitarian cooking pots may represent a
more primitive firing method used on plainwares which survived
from earlier times.
If the analogy holds, it is very possible
that less fuel was used by the prehistoric potters of the
Tularosa Basin than by modern potters; hence a lower temperature
range would be expected.
The lower temperature range of 450 0 to
650°C, with a median temperature of 550°C, would thus be ex­
plained.
Firing technique would also partially account for the
carbon remains in cores of plain brownware sherds, as well as
the numerous cases of fireclouds.
After firing, vessels are sometimes coated with organic
materials.
Chapman (1953: 7) notes animal and vegetable fats
permeate the clay to seal the pores of cooking pots at Santo
Domingo.
If analogous postfiring organic treatments were applied
to vessels in the Tularosa Basin, it might explain the two sherds
which turned darker during refiring.
Analogies have been drawn between ceramic manufacturing
techniques in modern Rio Grande, Zuni and Hopi pueblos and those
of the prehistoric populations of the Tularosa Basin.
Use of
analogy is appropriate because there is direct historical con­
tinuity between the two groups considered, they are basically at
the same level of cultural development, and while there has been
some climatic change, they employ basically similar adaptations
to basically similar environments in the same basic region.
The
analogy is most appropriate when comparing the more primitive
methods of preparing utilitarian cooking pots to the earlier
methods of making plain brownware.
Such methods would explain
many results of the technical analysis, such as the well-mixed
particle sizes, low range of firing temperatures, low degree of
oxidation, deep carbon streaking in cores and fireclouds.

CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS

281

Deetz (1967: 47) lists five factors operating on the selection
of attributes of any mental template: function of the artifact,
level of technology and traditions of the culture, innovation
(if any), and limitations inherent in the raw materials.
This
preliminary technical analysis has provided evidence of the
operation of at least three of those factors on the mental
template for plain brownware.
Innovation was not noticed as
such and appears to be missing; function will be addressed
elsewhere.
Tradition, the level of ceramic technology and the nature
of the raw materials themselves seem to be factors which inter­
twined with one another.
There is no evidence that the level
of technology changed over time, which would suggest that tradi­
tion was a major cultural force in the Tularosa Basin.
Since
the level of technology did not change, there developed no need
to change the raw materials selected.
The only variability
noted in the raw materials was in trace minerals and bimodality
of sand sizes; of these the first is probably natural and the
second possibly so.
Raw materials combined with a primitive
level of ceramic technology dictated a plain brownware that was
low-fired and poorly oxidized, with much sand and organic matter
rendering it porous and easily broken.
That tradition could not
completely stifle some dissatisfaction with oniy this pottery
is shown in the h h percentages of Chupadero Black on white and
other pottery types imported from other areas with higher levels
of technology and different raw materials.
It is possible that
lack of suitable raw materials prevented the potters of the
Tularosa Basin from attaining that higher level of technology
necessary to make comparable wares.
However, plain brownwares
are found allover southern New Mexico and western Texas, and
apparently persisted through the beginning of the twentieth
century in the Rio Grande pueblos.
This indicates the wide­
spread and traditional nature of the mental template responsible
for plain brownware.
ANSWERS TO PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS
Petrographic and mineralogical analyses revealed only a few
distinctly intrusive components of plain brownware (see Pigott's
interpretation of volcanic rock fragments, Part III, p·age 139).
The primary constituents are orthoclase and plagioclase feld­
spars, and quartz. all of which are common minerals in the
Tularosa Basin.
Plain brownware appears to be predominantly
local in origin with only a few exceptions.
Painted brownware, i.e.~ El PaBa Polychrome, appears to be
somewhat different than plain EZ PaBa Brown.
The extent and
nature of the differences bear further investigation,
EZ Paso
Polychrome does not seem merely a painted version of El PaBo

Brown.

282

EL PASO BROWNWARE

Firing temperatures range from 450-650 o C, with a median of
550°C. While lower than those employed in modern Pueblos, this
range was entirely suitable to the materials utilized, and re­
flects a generally more primitive level of ceramic technology.
This lower level of technology seems to be homogenous across
McGregor Range in terms of firing temperature ranges, materials
utilized, and methods employed.
Technical analysis revealed only
two variables in plain brownware: trace minerals and particle
sizes.
The first and possibly the second represent differences
in locally available raw materials.
The otherwise unvarying
monotony of plain brownware represents an incredible homogeneity
for such a widespread mental template.
Such differences as exist reflect local conditions at the
point of manufacture, but it does not seem possible to tie a
specific brownware sherd to a specific village.
While diverse,
the geology of the Basin is not so diverse mineralogically as to
permit such identifications at smaller spatial groupings.
Thus
tying specific seasonally-occupied sites to village habitation
sites does not seem possible with these samples.
Well-mixed, unsorted, igneous-derived soils with a high
organic content were often used while limestone-derived soils
seem to have been avoided.
On the basis of differences in trace
minerals and particle sizes of these soils, it does seem possible
to clarify the relationships between populations of different
areas.
If plain brownware is indeed the result of a very wide­
spread mental template, with locally available materials the only
difference between areas, it should also be possible to clarify
relationships between broad regions throughout southern New
Mexico and western Texas.
DESIGN FOR FURTHER RESEARCH
The importance of Fritz' and Plog's (1970) paper can be seen
in the large amount of discussion it generated, ranging from
protestations that some salvage work must be done anyway (Chenhall
1971) to well-reasoned critiques of the monocausal deductive­
nomological method itself, and particularly its first step of
generating hypotheses (Tuggle, Townsend, and Riley 1972).
Redman
(1973) has suggested a multi-stage research design in which arti­
fact analysis places a major role in generating hypotheses for
intensive field research.
This is probably the best role for
artifact collections resulting from contracted archological re­
connaissance.
The preliminary technical analysis has indicated promising
directions for future research.
In particular, the possibilities
inherent in the differences between locally-produced plain cera­
mics should be pursued, as well as the differences between El
Paso PoZychrome and Brown.
Indeed, enough information may have
been produced by the preliminary analysis to formulate hypotheses

-------------.---~

283

for later testing.
Some are presented below, along with a testing
methodology.
Presuming that the cultural mental template for plain brown­
ware remained constant across the lower Tularosa Basin, if not
beyond (as seems very likely), then such differences as exist in
plain brown potsherds should reflect resources locally available
at the point of manufacture of that plain brownware.
And if
plain brownware reflects the locally available resources at the
point of manufacture, then the occurence of brownware sherds at
sites where those resources were not locally available reflects
movement of the population which made them.
If the mental
template for EZ PaBO Polychrome was significantly different from
plain brownware and its points of manufacture more restricted (as.
seems very likely), then the material constituents of its sherds
reflect the more restricted range of resources available at those
points of manufacture.
And again, if this is true, then occur­
ence of El PaBo Polyohrome sherds at sites where that restricted
range of resources was not locally available reflects movement
or trade of the populations that made them.
If made locally, the plain brownware sherds on sites within
defined ceramic resource areas should be mineralogically similar
to the materials of those areas.
Three factors may exert an
influence to produce negative results of a test of this statement.
It is conceivable that major and continuous population movements
took place, during which ceramics manufactured in one locality
were transported to another routinely; but this degree of movement
would almost be equivalent to transhumance, which does not seem
likely for a horticultural semi-sedentary (possessing villages)
people.
It is also conceivable that plain brownware was traded
on a massive scale, resulting in a homogenous mixture of sherds
from different resource areas.
This also does not seem likely.
Ethnographic sources (Stephenson 1904; Guthe 1925) do not report
that plain culinary brownwares were traded, although minor
amounts of culinary pots undoubtedly did circulate via trade,
whereas decorated wares were very often traded.
Di Peso (1974:
623) reports that 80% of trade ceramics at Casas Grandes were
El PaBo PoZyohrome; EZ PaBo Brown is not mentioned. A third
influence could be temporal variation in resource selection, but
again ethnographic sources suggest a conservative tradition in
resource selection and the preliminary analysis did not provide
any evidence to refute this.
However, EZ PaBO Polychrome seems to have been traded ex­
tensively to the south.
It does seem likely that finding Poly­
chrome shetds of different mineral constituencies than are avail­
able near the site where they are found, could represent trade,
as well as, if not better than, actual population movements
(seasonal or otherwise).
A methodQlogy has been designed to test these statements.
This design will move from definition of the range of variability
to a statistically valid sample of that variability to a sub­
stantive evaluation of relationships perceived within that range.

284

EL PASO BROWNWARE

The first step will be the geological delineation of
specific source areas utilized by the prehistoric ceramists.
Trace minerals, grain sizes and shapes and basic clay mineral­
ogy will be established for each area, and the sites currently
known for each area identified.
It is expected that less than
ten such areas will be defined for McGregor Range.
Obviously
the total number of source areas for plain brownware for the
entire Tularosa Basin is much larger.
The same delineation of source areas will be done for the
points of manufacture of EZ Paso PoZyohrome.
This is expected
to be a considerably more difficult step, as fewer areas are
probably involved although the distribution of the type is
quite widespread.
The same criteria will be utilized: trace
minerals, grain sizes and shapes, and the basic clay mineral­
ogy involved.
Samples of the materials from each of the defined source
areas will then be collected, from playa bottoms and arroyo
banks alike, to obtain a valid sample of the raw materials.
Samples will be processed into slabs and fired; this step will
be as ethnographically accurate (consistent with procedures
described in an earlier section) as possible.
This will yield
a comparative base for each of the defined areas.
Such a base
may be saved and used for later comparative projects from other
areas, such as the Pecos River drainage.
All sites within each defined source area will then be
visited and a consistent and valid sample of EZ Paso Brown and
Polyohrome removed from each. Due to factors such as exposure
of ceramics, military activity and permission, and time avail­
ability, some modification of this step may prove necessary.
This would undoubtedly be in the direction of a random sample of
each restricted universe, but 100% sample is the target goal.
Further technical tests will be run on each sherd from the
sample drawn from these sites.
This will involve petrographic
analysis of thin-sections and x-ray diffraction analysis of the
remaining blanks.
Grain sizes and shapes, trace minerals, and
basic clay mineralogy will thus be determined for each sherd.
The resulting data will be compared against itself and the
data reSUlting from the processing of raw materials from each
source area.
The data resulting from sherds of each defined
area will be statistically compared against itself to determine
the central tendencies of plain brownware.
These central ten­
dencies will then be compared against the central tendencies of
the processed raw materials to test the first hypotheses, that
of local manufacture.
The central tendencies of Polyohrome
sherds collected from each defined source area will then be
determined and compared against the central tendencies of Brown
for each area to test the third hypothesis, that of restricted
points of manufacture for El Paso PoZyohrome.
If these hypotheses are upheld, further statistical manipu­
lations of the data will be utilized in substantive evaluations

DESIGN FOR FURTHER RESEARCH

285

of the relationships between specific source areas and the sites
within them.
Chi-square, analysis of variance, and regression
analysis will prove most useful.
Such mathematical analyses
will test the second and fourth hypotheses, that of population
movement, perhaps on a seasonal basis, of peoples carrying plain
brownware, and that of trade involving El Paso Polychrome.
This
will establish technical analysis of local ceramics as a major
tool in delineating the behavior of prehistoric populations.
SUMMARY
Plain brownware sherds are probably one of the most common
cultural items on McGregor Range.
These sherds represent vessels
made by the prehistoric populations from local materials, pri­
marily illites, orthoclase, plagioclase, and quartz.
Trace
minerals in these sherds seem to indicate several broad source
areas on the Range, although individual sites as ceramic sources
can only be approximated.
Sherds from sites on the northern
part of the Range differ from those from the southern part of
the Range, with northern sherds displaying trace minerals of
sedimentary origin and southern sherds displaying trace minerals
of igneous origin, as well as bimodal sand sizes.
Sherds from
sites in the central portion of the Range seem to have affinities
with both areas.
Sherds from sites known to differ in age but
within the same area do not seem to be substantially different;
local sources of the raw ceramic materials do not appear to have
changed over time.
These raw materials were processed and made
into vessels following a mental template for undecorated utili­
tarian ware that, if analogy is a valid inferential technique,
was similar to ethnographically described processes which sur­
vived in Rio Grande pueblos up to the twentieth century.
This
mental template appears to have been widespread across southern
New Mexico and western Texas, but locally available raw materials
differ sufficiently to recognize the products of general areas.
Complementary analytical techniques, x-ray diffraction and
petrographic analysis of thin-sections, revealed basic mineralogy
and petrology of several samples from sites representing every
area of McGregor Range, as well as trace mineralogy and a sand
bimodality.
Refiring tests revealed partially oxidizing tem­
perature ranges of 450-650 o C.
Comparison of sites on the basis
of preliminary results yielded spatial differences, but not
temporal differences.
Ethnographic analogy was employed to ex­
plain how these materials were processed and manufactured in
order to produce such results according to a common mental
template.
Comparisons with extant literature demonstrated the
widespread nature of the mental template for plain brownware
across southern New Mexico and western Texas.
A comprehensive
research design was proposed to investigate local variation in

EL PASO BROWNWARE

286

this mental template and that of El Paso Polychrome, for purposes
of tracing population movements and contacts within the area en­
compassed by McGregor Range.
This was a preliminary approach, an attempt to delineate some
of the technical parameters of plain brownware. Much cultural
information was revealed and, more importantly, the many possibi­
lities for cultural information inherent in plain brownware pot­
sherds were revealed.
A research design utilizing local brownware
was presented, in order to demonstrate the scientific potential
.
inherent in a common cultural item like the plain brown potsherds
of McGregor Range.

OSTEOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF TWO HUMAN BURIALS
SITE M-83
Robert F. Scott IV

ABSTRACT
In the course of the McGregor Range archeological as­
two adult burials were recovered from Site M-85~
located in Red House Tanks Canyon of the Hueco Mountains.
Burial 1 was found eroding from the surface of M-85 into a
nearby arroyo.
It was excavated in August~ 197&.
Burial 2
was located 100 meters south of Burial 1 in the same arroyo
and was removed in December~ 1975.
Cleaning and reconstruction of the bones was undertaken
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.
Acetate was used to clean the bones before they were coated
with poly vinyl acetate as a preservative and hardening agent.
sessment~

BURIAL I
Erosion had destroyed all of Burial I above the fourth
lumbar vertebra.
The skeleton, a mature adult, was placed in
a sitting, tightly flexed position, facing south.
Shafts of
the right humerus and left radius and ulna actually protruded
above the surface of the ground.
One half of a limestone,
basin metate was on the surface next to the skeleton and has
been associated with the skeleton on the basis of material
found in Burial 2.
A cairn of small limestone boulders had
once covered the burial before erosion scattered the rocks.
No burial pit was delineated in the shallow excavation neces­
sary to remove the remains, and no further burial goods were
noted.
Unfortunately. few complete long bones were recovered.
The drawn and upright burial placement exposed at least part
of every long bon~ to erosion and deterioration.
Only the
proximal halves of the femora were recovered. Likewise, in­
complete fragments of the humeri, tibias, and fibulas were

293

OSTEOMETRIC ANALYSIS

294

recovered.
The left radius and ulna each lost only proximal and
distal arti~ulations, whereas the right radius was entirely
intact and the ~ight ulna lacked only the proximal end.
Left
carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges were all accounted for ex­
cept for one proximal and one middle phalanx.
Of the right hand,
all carpals were present, though metacarpals 1 and 4 were absent,
as were all of the phalanges.
Both feet were recovered intact.
The pelvis and sacrum were recovered in remarkably good condition
along with the remaining fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae.
SEXING
Information from Bass (1971) and Anderson (1962) was used to
sex the pelvis by noting the sub-pubic angle in relation to the
pubic symphasis, then measuring the angle of the sciatic notch.
Further verification was obtained by comparing the width of the
sacral body to the ala and examining the superior-inferior curve
of the sacrum itself. All points noted indicated a male skeleton.
AGING
McKern and Stewart's (1957) method of examining three symphy­
sical components was used to age the pelvis.
In the absence of
any other potential age indicators (such as teeth) the calculated
age of 23 to 39 years must suffice.
With the beginning of osteo­
arthritis in the vertebrae and the body of the sacrum, I would
suggest an age of 30+ years.
STATURE
Bass uses a stature formula for the radius derived from
Trotter and Gesner (1952, 1958 cited in Bass 1971: 125).
Since
the radius was the most complete long bone, its length (25.56 cm.)
was applied to the Mongoloid formula (3.54 radius +82.00 ±4.60)
yielding a stature of 172.48 cm. ±4.60 cm.
Though this is con­
siderably higher than Howells (1932: 131) averages for males
from the Swarts Ruin, it must be kept in mind that he probably
used another formula and more reliable bones than the radius.
Though the bones of the leg should be used whenever possible,
they were too fragmentary in this case.
PATHOLOGY

BURIAL 2

A fairly complete adult-.keleton was removed in December,
1975 from a rock cairn on M-83.
The cairn was 2.5 meters in
diameter and contained the skeleton in the southeast corner of
its perimeter. Metate fragments were encountered with the
stones overlying the interment.
A possible burial pit outline
was observed in the excavation.
No artifacts were found in
direct association.
Placement was on the right side, tightly
flexed, and facing southwest.
The right arm lay across the
chest with the hand near the knees.
The left hand was placed
to the face.
Briefly, the following parts of the skeleton were
present:
Skull •••• ••••••.••• ••• fragmentary
Maxi11a .•••..•••••••.• complete with one intact tooth
Mandible ••.•.•••••..•• complete with eight teeth
Vertebrae ••.•••••••••• seven cervical (fragmentary)
ten thoracic (fragmentary)
four lumbar (fragmentary)
Pelvis ..••..••.•....•• fragmentary--no sacrum
Ribs •••••••••••••••••• complete
Fragments of the humerus, radius, and ulna of each arm were
inadequate to reconstruct the limbs.
The left hand was complete
except for some middle and distal phalanges.
Five phalanges and
two metacarpal fragments represented the right hand.
Both feet
were missing, though no e~idence exists to support an antemortem
cause.
Fragments of the sternum, left scapula, and left clavical
completed the inventory.
Deterioration and postmortem crushing rendered most of the
axial skeleton useless.
Though the mandible and maxilla remained
intact, the vault was fragmented, and warped by rock arid soil
weight, ,making it impossible to take measurements. Most of the
vertebral column and upper long bones were fragmented.
The pel­
vis was entirely crumbled.
None of the leg bones retained proxi­
mal or distal articulations.
MAXILLA
Mild resorption of the alveolar bone had apparently taken
place some time prior to death, indicating that some sort of
peridontal disease may have affected this individual.
The left
first prem~lar and molars one and two had been absent before
death, as evidenced in the resorbed sockets. Molars one and two
of the right side were also absent and marked by resorbed sockets.
Molar three of the left and right sides was missing, but a well
delineated socket remained on each side.
Remaining in the maxilla
was the right first premolar, worn well into the pulp cavity.

Sockets for all four incisors and both canines remained open,
these teeth probably having been lost postmortem.
MANDIBLE
Molars one through three remained on each side of the lower
jaw, along with the second right premolar, right canine, and
second right incisor. Wear had extended into the pulp cavities,
corresponding to Brothwell's (1972: 69) 35-to-45-years-01d wear
patterns from pre-medieval British skulls.
Unfortunately, ex­
cept for the less reliable osteoarthritic lipping of the verte­
brae, it was the only remaining part of the entire skeleton that
indicated age.
Alveolar resorption varied from slight under the
incisors to moderate under the molars, lending more evidence to
a peridontal infection of some form.
One abscess cavity was
visible under the left first molar.

STATURE
Stature was not calculated due to the loss of the proximal
and distal ends of the leg bones.
Damage to the arm bones made
their reconstruction and use impossible as well.
PATHOLOGY
An alveolar infection of the maxilla and mandible was the
most notable pathological occurrence in Skeleton 2.
Besides the
recession of the alveolar bone, an abscess cavity under the
lower left first molar was present.
Osteoarthritis had inflicted
various degrees of lipping on the vertebrae.
The cervical verte­
brae exhibited slight lipping whereas the thoracic vertebrae ex­
hibited concavity and minor degeneration of the centra.
Ali of
the lumbar vertebrae fragments showed pronounced osteophytes and
concavity of the centra.
A minor swelling on the dorso-ventral
end of the left fibula resembled periosteosis as described by
Brothwe11 (1972: 134).

CONCLUSION

297

CONCLUSION
Both skeletons were remarkably free of anomalies other than
the tooth wear and osteoarthritic lipping expected in adult
skeletal remains.
I would age Skeleton 1 at 30+ years and
Skeleton 2 at slightly over 40 years on the basis of teeth and
the overall skeletal components.
Neither the periosteosis or
the alveolar infection appeared serious at the time of death
for Skeleton 2.
The cause of death was not ascertained in either
of the remains.
Information about Skeleton 1 was limited by the
loss of the bones-above the fourth lumbar vertebra.
Damage to
the pelvis, skull, and long bones of Skeleton 2 limited the study
to description and inventory of the material.
Neither of these
burials could clearly be associated with the site nor could they
be assigned to either the Native American or the Anglo-European
population group.
