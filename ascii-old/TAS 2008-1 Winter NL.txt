Pursuing Opportunity to Preserve the Past
Meet Laurie Moseley, New TAS President
I am often asked how I got into archeology. As a student
at Woodrow Wilson HS in Dallas, I was required to check
out possible career paths. I had already read many of the
traditional books about archeology; especially Gods, Graves
and Scholars by Ceram. As part of my assignment, I wrote
the Archeology Institute of America and other organizations
asking about jobs and how to prepare for them. Their unanimous reply was to forget the idea because there were no jobs
and if I got a job, I would starve to death. A couple of my
friends ignored their advice and ended up with jobs in the
Near East and on the river basin surveys.
Upon graduating from TCU, back when it was not expensive to attend there, I tried to get a job, but, outside of
sales jobs, there were no jobs for someone with a double
major in History and in English. Despite only having one
course in education (the History of Education), I got a job as
a missionary teacher in the U.S. Virgin Islands. I was there
during the Cuban Missile Crisis and returned home the next
year. I interviewed for jobs as a teacher, but got little response. Just as I was on the point of going back to college to
work on an advanced degree, I got a call from the Superintendent of Glen Rose ISD. He needed a mathematics teacher
fast; the previous one had quit saying that he would not teach
the “New Math.”
So I became a combination mathematics and English
teacher. After a couple of years, the Texas Education Agency
insisted that I go back to college and get a teacher’s certificate.
I worked on the certificate and also began work on my
Masters degree. That October, 1963, I was in Dallas and read
about the TAS Annual meeting at SMU. I went and signed
up and have been a member ever since. As an avocational
member, I have been able to go places that I would never
have ever seen; I have met wonderful people such as Dr.
Mott Davis and Norman Flaigg. Because I was spending my

summers working on my certification and Masters, I could
not attend Field School for several years.
However, I attended the Annual Meeting almost every
year. After Julia and I married, I took her to the next Annual
Meeting, which was in Waco. She had to sit through many
boring papers with, to her, incomprehensible language. Finally the last paper of the day was presented; it was on digs
at pioneer farmsteads in East Texas. She got excited about
the Confederate buttons, broken bottles, and broken dishes
they showed; she was hooked also. The next year, we made
arrangements to go the field school at McKinney Falls. Boy,
were we green. The first night we almost froze to death. Who

would have thought that you needed a blanket during the
middle of a Texas summer! Thanks to Teddy Lou Stickney,
who loaned us a spare blanket, we survived.
McKinney Falls was the first dig for Norman Flaigg
also and we became friends with him and his new bride.
Unfortunately, Julia hurt her back clearing brush at the grist
mill excavation, so she was not able to do much. I took our
three year old son and sat him on the screen so Julia could
spend time with our one year old daughter. A couple of
highlights of the dig were laying in the creek above the falls
and letting the water just run over us and filling the cistern
with objects for future excavators to find. Get someone to
tell you about that sometime. Ron Ralph was one of the two
PI’s and he and Mike McEachern were hippies; I think he
still is at heart. They wore t-shirts with “Forward into the
Past” and “I dig dirt” written on them. After a few days, the
shirts were very dirty and smelled badly. One day, when they
went swimming, some ladies stole the shirts and washed
them. On the last evening, the shirts were auctioned off. A
lady sitting just in front of us was a high bidder. When the
shirt was delivered to her, people said, “put it on.” So she
turned her back on the crowd and took off her shirt and put
on the new shirt. Unfortunately, we were sitting behind her
and I had to quickly shield my son’s eyes, because she had
nothing on under her shirt.
I was a crew chief at the Galveston Island FS the next
year. There are many stories I could tell about the experience. One, that was funny and somewhat embarrassing to
me, was the day we were to be taken on an afternoon tour of
the Strand. I put on clean khaki work clothes and started to
go; Julia said, “You are not going like that are you?” Meaning you better not go like that. She made me shave in cold
water using the side view mirror on my old blue pickup. We
went with Dr. Davis and a couple of other professionals.
Since I was wearing a pith helmet, a news photographer
stopped us and asked me to pretend to look at some old
bricks because I looked like an archeologist; Dr. Davis sure
had a big laugh over that.
As I got more and more experienced, I began leading
surveys and small excavation testing sites. With the assistance
and guidance of Pat Mercado-Allinger and Dan Potter, I
published some papers on unusual artifacts that local
collectors had found. Now, after more than forty years of
doing archeology, reading about archeology, and speaking
about archeology to groups ranging from children to senior
citizens, I realize that most people care about the past and
want to preserve it; all they ask for is to be given an
opportunity to help. That is why I organized the Parker

County Archeological Society (PCAS). Due to development
and also due to gas well drilling, Parker County is losing
sites at an extremely high rate. The PCAS will help to
document sites and steer development around them if at all
possible, or get as much information recorded before sites
are destroyed or damaged. I have worked with ranchers and
developers for many years in locating and protecting sites.
The Tarrant County Archeological Society (TCAS) is
furnishing support and guidance to the PCAS. Depending on
permission from the County Commissioners, the first project
for the PCAS will be to document the Parker County Poor
Farm. The plan is to document the existing buildings, get
oral histories of the Poor Farm, and to investigate the
prehistoric sites that are there. As TAS President, I am going
to try to get new societies formed in as many different places
as we can get them started. People want to experience the
past; we need to give them the opportunity.

Preliminary Notice for the 50th Annual
Caddo Conference, March 7-9, 2008
Northwestern State University,
Natchitoches, Louisiana
2008 will mark the golden anniversary of the
Caddo Conference. To commemorate this milestone,
we are compiling a 50th anniversary program and
are looking for digital copies of photographs from
prior conferences. If you have some good ones, or if
you have stories or memories of past conferences,
participants, etc., that you would like to share, please
send those along as well.
A first call for papers will be sent out in December. We encourage submissions that reflect upon
the past 50 years of Caddo research, as well as new
research directions. Of course, we also invite research papers that examine other aspects of Caddo
archaeology, ethnography, and history.
This year, as a public component of the conference, we will also sponsor a poster session. Posters
should relate information on some aspect of Caddo
culture in a manner that will be useful for presentation
to the general public. The posters will be available
after the conference for use by the Caddo and others
involved in public education. Electronic files with the
poster designs may be submitted for printing here.

TAS Archeology Academies for 2008

A Lithics Academy, hosted by the Houston
Archeological Society, will be presented in Houston at St.
Thomas University, Scanlon Hall, on January 26 and 27,
2008. This Academy is designed to provide hands-on
experience for recognizing and analyzing stone artifacts.
You will learn the different ways in which stone tools were
made, how to recognize their different use-wear patterns
and the interpretation of stone artifacts found in the
archeological record. Flint knapping demonstrations will
focus understanding how the archaeological record is
formed. Dr. Harry Shafer will lead the workshop with the
assistance of Dr. John Dockall and flint knapping specialist
Dr. Cary Voss.
The Archeology 101 academy will introduce basic archeological procedures, techniques for recovery of data, and
methods for preserving valuable archeological resources. The
focus of this academy is “What do Archeologist do and why
do they do it?” Instruction will include identifying archeological sites, mapping visible remains, analyzing evidence,
reporting finds, and protecting our heritage from destruction.
Dr. Harry Shafer will teach the academy with assistance
from local experts.
Classes will be held at the T. B. Harris Community
Center, 401 North Alexander St., Belton. Classes will begin
on Friday evening February 8, at 7:00–9:30 PM. Classes will
continue on Saturday February 9, (9AM until 5PM). On
Sunday we will meet at 7:30AM at a designated location and
caravan to the Gault site for field survey and limited testing.
We will work until lunchtime and have a catered lunch
together to discuss and wrap-up our experience. Participants
should be in good physical health and able to walk over
rough terrain.
A Rock Art Academy in Van Horn, will begin Friday
evening, February 29, and continuing through the weekend
on Saturday and Sunday, March 1-2. A combination of classroom discussions and field tours led by the Center for Big
Bend Studies, Sul Ross State University, will introduce participants to the amazing variety and extent of rock art in far
West Texas. Working with presenters Melissa Williams
(CBBS Archeologist) and Reeda Peel (CBBS Director of
Rock Art Documentation and Research), participants will
explore the rock art of Texas within a global framework,
view the rock art of Trans Pecos Texas, and consider current
theories on the interpretation of rock art.

Archaeology in the Top of Texas: The 2008
and 2009 TAS Field Schools
By Scott Brosowski

Introduction
After a twenty year absence the Texas Archaeological
Society (TAS) will once again return to the upper Texas
panhandle for their 2008 and 2009 summer field schools.
For those not familiar with the archaeology of this vast and
somewhat remote region, it is apparent that the panhandle
has lagged behind many other parts of the state in terms of
the amount of information known about its past peoples.
This has largely been a result of the absence of a major
university that actively conducts archaeological research in
the area and limited amounts of projects, such as reservoir
and construction projects, which have required extensive
archaeological field work by cultural resource management
companies. To help fill these gaps in knowledge the upcoming field schools will examine a number of research
issues that currently remain unknown or poorly understood.
Accordingly, participants in the upcoming 2008 and 2009
TAS field schools will have the opportunity to conduct
important field research that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on future generations of archaeologists working in this region.
In contrast to typical TAS field schools, the upcoming
field schools in 2008 and 2009 will investigate a variety of
different archaeological sites. These sites include localities
repeatedly occupied over several hundred years by mobile
hunter-gatherers, 700 year old villages inhabited by sedentary horticulturalists, and historic Indian and U.S. military
encampments established during the 1860s. While at first
glace this may seem like a lot of work to accomplish in two
short field seasons, the reader should bear in mind that the
scale of investigations planned for most of these sites is
really quite limited and should be completed by small crews
in a matter of a few days. Even so, since there are many
unknown variables, such as weather conditions during the
field school or the number of people actually involved in
each field school, the proposed research strategies are very
flexible and can be adjusted as is necessary.
The fieldwork planned for the field school includes: 1)
open block excavations at three sites, 2) limited test excavations at several sites, 3) pedestrian survey, and 4) the recording of previously identified sites. Two archaeological field
laboratories will be established to process the cultural materials collected during fieldwork. The following provides a
brief introduction to some of the sites that will be studied and

the types of the research questions we wish to address through
these investigations.

Chill Hill (41RB132)
One of the primary sites that will be investigated is a large
Antelope Creek phase horticultural village called Chill Hill.
This site, which was not discovered until the summer of 2005,
aptly demonstrates that there are still many areas of the Texas
panhandle that have yet to be explored by archaeologists. In this
case it is nothing short of amazing that this site was only
recently found since it covers an area approximately 600,000
m2, has dense concentrations of artifacts littering the ground
surface, and is only about 600 meters from a major highway.
This site is situated on a low, dividing ridge between two
tributary streams to the Canadian River. Historically, neither of
these streams has contained running water, however, judging
from the size and apparent length of occupation represented at
Chill Hill indicates that this has not always been the case.
Shortly after its discovery, a shallow subsurface geophysical survey was conducted by Archaeo-Physics LLC of
Minneapolis, Minnesota. These surveys employed a gradiometer and a soil resistance meter and examined nearly 19,000
m2 or about 3% of the site. These surveys were very successful
in identifying numerous cultural features, such as residential
structures, storage facilities, middens, and hearths, throughout

sive midden deposits containing plentiful quantities of artifacts and debris that is sure to provide an
exciting setting for the children’s excavation program.
Because test excavations at Chill Hill indicate
that it is likely that we will recover large quantities
of artifacts during our field work we have decided
to set up a field laboratory at this site. A large,
cement floored building with electricity and water
is already present at the site. From this location we
should be able to effectively process all of the
artifacts and flotation samples collected from the
site.

Phase Settlements

the area examined. The quantity and concentration of features
identified suggests that this may have been one of the most
intensively occupied portions of the settlement.
Test excavations carried out at the site suggest that most
of the cultural features are shallowly buried and were likely
backfilled with trash after they were abandoned. The two,
one-by-one meter test units excavated encountered a subterranean storage pit and the interior of a residential structure. The
excavation of these test units resulted in the recovery of just
over 13,000 artifacts, including chipped stone tools and
debitage, faunal remains, ceramics, marine shell ornaments,
and various other items. To give the reader some idea as to the
density of artifacts recovered from each of these test units,
about 1000 items were collected per 10 cm level! This site is
also somewhat unusual compared to most other Antelope Creek
phase settlements in that relatively high frequencies of trade
items obtained through exchange with the eastern Pueblos of
New Mexico were recovered during survey and excavation.
At Chill Hill we hope to excavate large residential areas
at the site through open block excavation. Once features,
such as houses, storage facilities, hearths and activity areas,
are uncovered we can begin to understand the layout and
organization of these villages. Since it is unlikely that we
will be able to completely excavate all of the features that are
found, we will judiciously select a sample of these for further work. In addition, Chill Hill has areas containing exten-

The Chill Hill site is located near the
confluence of two tributary streams and the Canadian River floodplain. Although this large Antelope Creek village clearly dominates the landscape,
there are nine additional Antelope Creek phase sites
scattered up one of the tributary streams from Chill
Hill. We are interested in understanding the social,
economic, and political relationship that existed
between Chill Hill and these other sites. Did these
sites represent satellite communities that were established as the population at Chill Hill increased through
time? Did they represent populations of people that were
attracted from elsewhere to settle near Chill Hill? Was there
some form of an economic or political hierarchy that linked
these sites or was each of these sites completely autonomous? Is it possible that when this valley was originally
settled that clusters of families were dispersed up and down
the valley only to aggregate into a single large settlement at
Chill Hill at a later date?
In conjunction with our excavations at Chill Hill we
would like to conduct limited test excavations at as many of
these smaller Antelope Creek phase settlements as is possible. Our previous work on these types of sites suggest that
it should be possible to recover the adequate samples needed
for accurately determining the composition of material assemblages, the orientation of subsistence economies, and
dating individual sites through limited testing. This information will allow us to address many of the topics noted above.

Halston (41OC100)
The second primary site that we plan to work on is called
the Halston site. Halston represents a large historic Indian
encampment located near the Buried City locality on Wolf
Creek. Diagnostic Euro-American artifacts recovered during
preliminary investigations suggest that this locality was repeatedly occupied between 1825 and 1875. Artifacts recov-

Metal arrowpoints from the Halston Site.
ered include metal arrowpoints, horse related gear, German
silver ornaments, brass wire bracelets, tin and brass cone
tinklers, bison hide fleshers, fragments of brass cooking kettles,
glass beads, clothing buttons, butcher knives, iron awls, parts
of flintlock and percussion guns, and debris associated with
the production of arrowpoints, tools, and ornaments.
Despite abundant historical and anthropological research
on post-contact Indians of the Southern Plains, these societies have been virtually ignored by archaeologists. Our work
at the Halston site will help to amend this situation. We are
planning to expose large areas of this site through open block
excavation. Shovel tests excavated during a metal detecting
survey conducted at Halston indicate that the historic Indian
component is contained in the upper 30 cm of the site. As a
result, it should be possible to expose a large area of the site
in a relatively short period of time.
Investigations at Halston will attempt to address a
number of different research issues. First of all, we are hoping
to determine how many different times this site was occupied.
The recovery of additional diagnostic trade items will be
crucial for examining this topic. On a related note, it was
mentioned above that the recovery of diagnostic trade items
suggest that the site was occupied after 1825. However, if
earlier related components are present at this site, but are
characterized by cultural assemblages consisting of bone,
stone, wood, and few metal trade items, these occupations
would not have been identified during our metal detector
survey. Currently, historical accounts suggest that EuroAmerican goods may not have become commonplace among
tribes of the Southern High Plains until a relatively late date
(ca. 1820 to 1840). Excavations at Halston may allow us to
better understand the precise timing of this pivotal cultural
transition. Lastly, our work at Halston will serve as an important

The last site that will see substantial work during the TAS field schools is a military supply depot
established by Brevet Lieutenant Colonel A. E.
Evans. This encampment was inhabited by 525 men
and represented one of three major military detachments employed as a part of General Philip H.
Sheridan’s 1868 winter campaign. This campaign
sought to punish bands of Indians who were raiding
in retaliation against the ever increasing tide of white
men that were encroaching on their lands and rapidly depleting their resources.
Besides Evans’ group from Fort Bascom, New Mexico,
military detachments were also sent into the field from Fort
Lyon, Colorado under the direction of Brevet Brigadier
General Eugene A. Carr and Brevet Brigadier General W. H.
Penrose and another from Kansas under Colonel George A.
Custer. Of these three detachments, the latter is best known
for their attack and burning of a peaceful village of Cheyenne
led by the noted peace chief Black Kettle on the Washita
River in Indian Territory.
The remains of Evans’ supply depot were found in
2004 by THC Stewards Alvin Lynn and Rolla Shaller and
Mike Gilger at the confluence of a south flowing tributary
stream and the Canadian River floodplain. Metal detector
surveys conducted at this time identified two main areas
occupied by Evans and his men. Artifacts recovered
included .50-70 shell casings, lead bullets, horseshoes,
canteens, military eagle buttons, tin can food containers,
picket pins, and a wide variety of other items and equipment
typical of the Civil War era. Features identified at the site
include numerous military dugout depressions and an area
occupied by the expedition blacksmith. A third separate
area has also been found that contained a mixture of historic
Indian artifacts and sparse quantities of military artifacts.
This area may represent a later occupation by Kiowa and/or
Comanche Indians who scavenged items that littered the
nearby abandoned military camp.
Previous excavations have examined one of the dugout
depressions along the western border of the site. This work
exposed a dugout roughly five-by-five meters in size and
excavated to a depth of nearly two meters below ground
surface. The recovery of numerous tools, equipment, and
trash debris on or near the floor of this short-term habitation

The Late Archaic/Woodland Transition
The last group of sites to be investigated in the upcoming field schools is a series of camps repeatedly occupied by
mobile foraging societies between about 1000 B.C. and A.D.
1000. These sites are indicative of a time period which,
although represented by literally thousands of sites in the
region, has received almost no attention from archaeologists.
While several important technological developments occurred
during this period, their timing remains poorly understood.
First, there was a shift from the use of the atlatl to the
adoption of the bow-and-arrow. Later in time witnessed the
earliest production of ceramics in the region, and in at least
some areas, the introduction of limited horticulture. While
the overall importance of these developments and their role
in culture change is far from clear, sites containing dart

seldom described in formal records and journals. For exunusual in that they are situated in settings that are not
ample, is it possible to differentiate between areas of the site

This work resulted in the recovery of sizeable
samples of all classes of artifacts including carbonized plant remains. Given that the other Archaic-Woodland sites in this valley contain similar
types and quantities of artifacts, are located in
comparable settings, and appear to be similar in
all other respects, it is anticipated that limited
testing at these sites should also yield comparable
results to that observed at the Bee Jay site. It is
hoped that this work will yield substantial information regarding a time period for which very
little is known at present. Whatever the case, this
work should provide an important baseline of

Pedestrian Surveys
In addition to the excavations discussed above, two small
crews will conduct pedestrian surveys on one of the large
Courson Family ranches on the Canadian River. The first of
these crews will concentrate on the recording and documentation of a large number of prehistoric sites identified several
years ago in a single tributary stream valley to the Canadian
River. These sites include localities occupied by mobile foragers as well as homesteads and hamlets inhabited by sedentary horticulturalists. Altogether, these sites represent a broad
range of the site types found in the Canadian River valley
and will provide an excellent introduction to archaeological
sites and cultural assemblages of the region.
Lastly, our work over the last few years has indicated
that the methods typically employed by archaeologists during pedestrian surveys are generally quite successful in identifying most prehistoric sites and early historic homesteads.
However, many ephemeral historic period sites, such as historic Indian, military, and buffalo hunter encampments are
rarely documented. This is a result of the fact that archaeologists seldom incorporate metal detectors during pedestrian
survey. As such, the second surveying crew will be trained in
the use of metal detectors. Following this training the crew
will examine areas previously surveyed for the presence of
historic sites.

Summary
Overall, we are very thrilled to be hosting the two upcoming TAS field schools. After working in most every part
of Texas, I would argue that it is difficult to find another area
of the state that offers the extraordinary variety of sites that
are found in the Texas panhandle. This coupled with the
paucity of previous archaeological work and a climate which
has resulted in the excellent preservation of sites and artifacts is sure to provide a setting for two very exciting TAS
field schools. We believe that the diversity of sites we have
selected for investigation will ensure that participants, no
matter what their area of interest may be, will be sure to find
something that is right up their alley!
While we recognize that the TAS summer field school is
an occasion for old friends to get together and socialize, we
are also extremely excited to address a number of significant
archaeological issues that without the help of the TAS might
not be resolved for several decades. In all, we have no doubt
that the two upcoming field schools will be memorable for
the sites investigated, the live bands that played into the

night, the barbeques, the new friends that were made, and the
artifacts that were found, but perhaps most importantly, we
are excited about the vital role that we will have played in
advancing our knowledge of the peoples that once inhabited
this remarkable and strikingly beautiful part of Texas.

A Visit to Ochiltree County
By Glynn Osburn
After an absence of 20 years, the TAS Field School will
return to the upper Panhandle near Perryton for 2008. Mr.
Harold Courson and his family have invited TAS back to the
Courson ranch to help conduct some important archeological
investigations to be directed by Dr. Scott Brosowske.
Thanks to the hospitality of Mr. Courson, attendees will
be treated to two catered dinners with live entertainment.
The first will be on Saturday, June 14, and then we will
climax the Field School on Friday, June 20th, with dinner
and entertainment by the well-know band, Asleep at the
Wheel. Please plan on staying through Friday night for this
memorable dinner with special entertainment. For the other
days in camp, our outstanding Field School cooks will again
be with us, serving up their excellent breakfasts and dinners.
Bob Smith and Dempsey Malaney will serve as CoCamp bosses. Our campground will be at picturesque Wolf
Creek Park and Lake Fryer, in Ochiltree County about 15
miles from Perryton. Large elm and cottonwood trees at the
campsite on the south side of the lake promise an enjoyable
tenting experience. Bathhouses with restrooms will be available nearby. There are also 54 RV hookups with water and
electricity on the south side of the park where TAS will be
located. Besides the camping, the park and lake also offer
fishing, swimming, boating, and there are playgrounds as
well as hiking and jogging trails. Camping fees will be waived
at the campground for us. Please note that the park does not
allow glass containers, so leave them at home. We are also
cautioned to bring a light jacket as it sometimes can get cool
at night (makes for great sleeping). There is also a restaurant

at Lake Fryer which will be convenient to participants.
Perryton is only seven miles south of the Oklahoma
state line and it is the northernmost county seat in Texas.
There are several motels in the city as well as some fine
restaurants. Motels are, Best Western, ph: 806-834-2850,
and Ambassador Inn, 806-435-9611. A new motel, the
Baymont Inn and Suites, will be completed in March. The
Perryton Chamber of Commerce may be contacted at 806435-6575, http://perryton.org/. The chamber will mail out
information packets upon request.
Additional details and directions to the campground will
be in the Spring TAS newsletter.

TAS Annual Meeting in Review
The 78th Annual Meeting of the Texas Archeological
Society, held at the historic Menger Hotel in San Antonio,
Texas, October 26th -28th, was an unqualified success. There
were a total of 354 registered participants. The program of
activities included over 100 individual papers and posters
with nearly every aspect of Texas archaeology represented.
The Friday night Public Forum, sponsored by Humanities
Texas, and featuring Dr. Mike Collins of the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory and Dr. Kathleen Deagan of the
Florida Museum of Natural History, was a big draw with

over 425 in attendance. The banquet speaker was Dr. Doug
Owsley of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.
Over 200 people attended the banquet and enjoyed an exhaustive and informative speech. Dr. Owsley’s presentation
focused on the skeletal material of the early English Colonies and kept the audience mesmerized for nearly two hours.
Silent Auction co-chair Candy Smith hopes the recipients of the loot appreciate all of the time spent pacing the
floor and looking to see if they had the last bid was as much
fun as it was to watch. We had some really nice items that
were donated and as always, a good selection of books.

the foyer of the Menger Hotel. Fourteen CRM firms, state
agencies, and/or educational outreach programs set up table
displays for students, registered TAS & CTA members, and
the general public to find out about careers and what’s
happening in archeology around Texas. We met with many
students who were busily making contacts/networking at the
social. Thanks to all who made it happen, including CTA for
sponsoring the refreshments third year in a row! Please mark
your calendars to participate and/or attend next year’s 4th

Banquet Costume Contest:
This year’s costume contest at our Saturday night banquet has to take the cake for being the funniest! If you were
there you know what/who I’m talking about, and if you
weren’t please see the pictures below…but in person you

had to be there to get the “full” effect! I’m still LOL! Our
theme this year was “Best of Saturday Night Live/SNL” and
folks were encouraged to come as one of their favorite characters in the 32 years of SNL’s existence on NBC. The few
individuals that had the nerve to dress up not only did a great
job with their costumes but also really acted out the part! We
had four prize categories:
1) Best “Saturday Night Live” Costume: Went to Doug
Boyd, as “Church Lady” (“isn’t that special”)…. all I can
say is “Oh my G…!” Hope someone filmed him/her on
video coming through the audience to receive his prize!

2) Best “Partner” Costumes: Went to the couple that traveled from France with furry rings on their coneheads:
Walt Allinger and Pat-Mercado-Allinger as the
“Coneheads!” And then to boot, Pat received the newest TAS Fellow Award and had to have her photo taken
again as a conehead! Don’t kill me Pat!
3) Best “Archeology” related costume went to Ruth Marie
as the “Masai Warrior Woman” (Wow!). Have to say
that Ron Ralph got a lot of votes as going as himself
dressed in his red Hawaiian shirt!
4) Best “Disguised” costume (most different from self or
unrecognizable): Went to Ona B. Reed as one of the
“Cone Heads” offering folks a bite of toilet paper! Too
too funny! Ona should be everyone’s role model for
knowing how to have fun and actually doing it!

Other costumes included to name a few: “Mary Catherine

a good laugh!

“Historic Riverwalk Pub Crawl &
Scavenger Hunt”
When most folks were snug in their hotel beds after the
great presentation by Dr. Doug Owsley during the Saturday
night banquet (which let out about 11:30pm), about 40 TAS
“night owls” wearing “glow sticks” were scavenging around
the San Antonio Riverwalk in the dark looking for answers
to clues provided in their contest packets. Examples of questions included: 1) “What is the archeological feature (enclosed in glass) that is located across from the Alamo (Alamo
Square on S. Alamo Street sidewalk) at the entrance to the
Riverwalk & what it is made of? 2) What restaurant has table
canopies designed like the Texas Flag? Bonus – what famous San Antonio architect’s name is on the building and
what is he known as the “father” of? and 3) What “matters”
to Nelly? Folks had the choice of working in pairs or as a
team and at this hour we actually had 10 teams of contestants, with five teams winning prizes for completing all the
contest questions correctly! Two gals even had the nerve to
dance at the bar at “Coyote Ugly” for triple bonus points and
had a cell phone image to prove it! We wrapped everything
up and had a blast all hanging out together at Zincs! Thanks
to everyone for participating even if it was to join us for a
drink at Nelly’s! For me this was a great way to hang out
with friends and “chill out” after a successful meeting/auction! Hmmm. . . scavenger hunt in Lubbock! Volunteers?

Over the past almost 40 years we have had, and continue
to have great TAS mentors. Jay Blaine is one of those who
received a long overdue Golden Pen Award at the Annual
Meeting Banquet, held at the Menger Hotel in San Antonio.

prehistoric sites in Fayette, Colorado, Austin, and Waller
Counties. He has served as the Houston Archeological Society
(HAS) Field Director for many years, and has arranged
property access for many HAS excavation projects.
Joe is a Past President of the HAS, and is a member of
the HAS, the Fort Bend Archeological Society, and the Texas
Archeological Society. He has received the Southeast Texas
Archeological Research Award and the Merit Award of the
HAS, and the Golden Pen Award of the TAS.
He has authored or co-authored 71 publications on prehistoric sites. He is the senior author of two reports on the
archeology of the Mexican Army retreat route in 1836, and
has published an article on the archeology of Post West Bernard of the Texas Army. Hudgins has published two articles
on an important historic Karankawa Indian site in Wharton
County. We congratulate Joe Hudgens on his Distinguished
Service to TAS and to the archeological community.

The Francis Stickney Field School Award
Goes to Two Outstanding Recipients
Over the decades, Jay has generated and contributed to
numerous publications. He has written on topics as varied as
Early Man sites in west Texas to the preservation and study
of metal artifacts. He is the foremost authority on Spanish
and French colonial period metal artifacts recovered from
Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana sites. To the benefit of the
discipline, he has authored and co-authored a large number
of articles, reports and book reviews on these varied subjects. He continues to undertake research and is currently
assisting the Texas Historical Commission’s La Salle projects,
responsible for the identification and analysis of small arms
from the Belle shipwreck and the metal artifacts from the illfated Fort St. Louis site. The results of these analyses will be
incorporated into forthcoming technical reports on the Belle
and Fort St. Louis.
Jay Blaine is also a TAS Fellow, former TAS president
and this year’s recipient of the Society for American
Archaeology’s Crabtree Award for the 2007 Golden Pen
Award. As an aside it was noted that he and his wife were
married in San Antonio 64 years ago and their honeymoon
trip consisted or a ride in a canoe on the San Antonio River
after having given a pint of blood in order to get the day off.

Having worked closely with the TAS Youth Group for
many years now, all of us agree that the Neal Stilley has
gone above-and-beyond the call of duty and deserves recognition for his many contributions to the annual field school.
He has been co-director of the Youth Group for the last
seven field schools since 2001. To complement the experi-

ence that the kids get in hands-on archeology, Neal directs
the educational activities and uses many different hands-on
activities that he has created over many years. While the kids
are thrilled because of that and have a lot of fun, they are also
learning. Neal teaches them material culture, artifacts, and
archeology, primitive technologies, adapting to different environments, and natural history. He is particularly successful
as a teacher because he relates well to the kids and makes
learning fun.
A total of 380 kids have participated in the last seven
field schools, and many are repeat offenders who love the
Youth Group activities. He has made an impact on almost all
of them! Neal has been, and hopefully will continue to be, an
important player in the success of the TAS field school.
When we think of this person we often find ourselves
smiling really big smiles! We know Field School has started
when we see this crew-member arrive to set up camp. Gladys
Swanson Franssen shows up yearly for TAS- rain or shine!

Stunned and speechless,

She arrives, sets up her camping spot, and prepares for a
week of work and fun. To the passerby she might seem on
the quiet, well-behaved side, as she tends to stay close to the
campsite while visiting with friends and family and working
on projects. Gladys also goes about the TAS work willingly
as assigned- no problem. She never really draws much attention to herself until. . . there is a skit or the awards night!
Then this quiet unassuming person comes alive!
A favorite memory of Gladys is the time she narrated
the “Evolution of an Archeologist” for the TAS Field School
at the Gault Site. She did a wonderful job of taking us from

the first Cave Man Archeologists (played by Nick Morgan
with the gorilla suit on BACKWARDS!) to the modern day
Archeologist (portraying Elton Prewitt and who knows about
his outfits!). Her description of how an Archeologist evolved
was worthy of an Oscar! That’s right- an Oscar Hotdog!
She also was the narrator for the TAS Beauty Contest
held down in Menard a few years back when Michael
McCauley won the much sought after title of Ms. TAS.
There was a lot of “stiff” competition that year for this
coveted title. If you will remember- ALL answers to the
really “tough” questions ended with, all together now—“and
WORLD PEACE!”
When not out on site for TAS, or enjoying time with
family, or working on a skit, Gladys can usually be found
working hard on her favorite past time-making jewelry! You
will often see her set up under a big shady tree working away
at a little table making necklaces and bracelets and if you
insist, selling them.
Yes, just the thought of Gladys Swanson Franssen brings
a smile to many of us! Thank YOU Gladys for sharing your
humor with all of as at TAS for so many years. We all look
forward to your fun additions next year!

C. K. Chandler Award
The newest TAS award is given to the avocational archeologist who records the most sites during the course of a
year. The award is named in honor of C.K. Chandler, a
prodigious site recorder. The award recognizes members’
efforts to document our irreplaceable and often endangered
archeological sites. The recipient must be a TAS member in
good standing. Site documentation must be submitted to the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory for an official trinomial. Documentation should minimally include a completed electronic TexSite form (an electronic program

Archeological Society, a number of them for multiple terms
(Co-Chairman, Texas Archeology Awareness Week Committee, TASN and TAM Liaison, Bylaws Committee chair
and member…).
Pat (along with the Executive Director) has represented
the TAS at the Council of Affiliated Societies in the Society
for American Archaeology. She and the Executive Director
served as co-chairs of the SAA’s 2007 local (Austin) arrangements committee.
For the past several years, she has developed and
given the Field School newcomers’ orientation program
for TAS, providing those new to our group and the Field
School a very professional, yet easily understood introduction to both archeology and the Society. Her efforts to
reach out to these individuals, from the time they register, through orientation and beyond, not only gives them
useful archeological background but other information to
make their first days at Field School less confusing—and
that in turn should lead them toward a positive view of
the Society and its members.
She has traveled to various corners of the state to meet
with local societies and to teach archeological techniques to
their members and she fills out a mean site form herself!
She is a competent, responsible leader and colleague
who is liked and admired by all who know her. She steps up
to bat whenever she is asked and is easy to work with,
knowledgeable (and clever) and can negotiate through bureaucratic tangles that would trip up the rest of us. She is an
excellent spokesperson for TAS. We are proud to have Pat
Mercado-Allinger as our newest TAS Fellow.

Archeologist, Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission. She is responsible for directing legislatively
mandated statewide archeological programs involving
original research, landowner assistance, historic preservation
planning, coordination with allied historic preservation and
archeological organizations, public outreach (including
coordination of Texas Archeology Month annual observances, popular publications and public presentations) and
the Texas Archeological Stewardship Network volunteer
program. She serves as the principal investigator for major
archeological investigations initiated in-house. Pat has
worked as an archeologist in the State Archeologist’s Office
directing archeological field, lab and scientific research
related to the state’s archeological programs since
1984. She became State Archeologist in 1996.
Prior to her duties with the Texas Historical Commission, Pat worked as a Staff Archeologist with Prewitt
and Associates, Inc. (Austin, TX) and as a Project
Archeologist with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). She has written and co-authored
numerous published works, documents and special reports on a statewide spectrum of sites and subjects.
Pat received her B.A. and M.A. in Anthropology
at the University of Arizona, Tucson. She is a member of the Society for American Archaeology, The
Society for Historical Archaeology, the Council of
Texas Archeologists, the Texas Archeological Society, the Travis County Archeological Society and the
Oklahoma Anthropological Society.
Elected offices she has held are: Vice-Chairman,
Council of Affiliated Societies, Society for American
Archaeology (1992-1998); President of the Texas Archeological Society (1990) and Director (1988); and
offices in the Travis County Archeological Society
Sharing the spotlight in a calmer, more dignified atmosphere,
and the Council of Texas Archeologists. She has also

Scholarship Fund Needs Your Dollars
TAS has three scholarship funds that merit your contributions. Each year the funds must be replenished by donations.
Scholarships are awarded based on the money in the funds.
The Native American Scholarship Fund provides money
for Native Americans to attend the Field School. It offers
membership, registration, food, dig kit and partial travel reimbursement. Since 2003 the number of Native Americans at
field school has grown significantly due to the efforts of the
original Multicultural Relations Committee and the availability of funding with 18 recipients attending in 2007.
The Student Scholarship Fund supports college students’ attendance at Field School, Annual Meeting and Academies as well as membership. Field school scholarship
recipients receive registration, food, supplies and travel. For
Annual Meeting they get registration and a travel stipend.
Academy participants will receive registration and partial
travel reimbursement. This program began in 2006 with four

students attending field school and two attending annual
meeting. In 2007 there were more applicants than money to
fund their participation in these TAS events.
The Diversity Program Scholarships will encourage
participation in TAS events—Field School, Annual Meeting
and Academies for groups other than Native Americans who
are not well represented in our membership. Recipients will
receive membership, registration and partial travel reimbursement. This will be the first year for the Diversity Program
committee to recruit participants and award scholarships.
Each event scholarship has its own deadline and application form. Information may be found online at www.txarch.org
under “Scholarships and Grants.”
Please send a donation to these scholarship funds to
encourage more active participation in archeology by faces
new to TAS!

Charles Eugene Mear
By A. Darryl James, Midland, Texas
Charles Eugene “Gene” Mear died Sept. 18, 2007, at the
age of 80 years after battling Parkinson’s disease for the last
few years. A productive, successful by any measure, petroleum and minerals geologist and geosciences manager, Gene
had a lifetime full of accomplishments, honors, friends and a
rich family life.
Gene went far in life coming from a modest background.
He had to live much of his early life in a tent with his mother
and stepfather as they followed work around during the depression. Later his parents settled in the country hollows of
Leakey, Texas where he learned to hunt and fish in the
beautiful forested hills and valleys. He attended school in
Leakey and Sabinal. An excellent student, he graduated valedictorian in his high school class.
One day hunting in the hollows of Leakey the darkhaired high school boy came across a group of Texas A & M
students mapping with a plane table. As they shared conversation and food, Gene learned they were geology students
mapping for their field geology class. Intrigued, this chance
moment made a strong impression on the youngster. He had
never met college students before, nor heard of geology and
knew little of college. World War II was grinding down
when he finished high school; college would have to wait.
He was drafted into the Army and served as a paratrooper in
the 11th Airborne Division in the Philippines and Japan.
Returning from Japan, Gene received an honorable discharge and attended Southwest Texas State Teachers College
(now Texas State University). Deciding that teaching was perhaps not his calling, Gene transferred to The University of
Texas where he earned bachelors and masters’ degrees in Geology in 1951 and 1953, respectively. His master’s thesis:
Quaternary Geology of the Upper Sabinal River Valley, Uvalde
and Bandera Counties, Texas was reprinted during l989 Summer Archaeological Field course, University of Texas, Austin
and partly reproduced by the Southern Texas Archaeological
Society in l990. Prior to finishing his master’s degree, he was
hired as a geologist by Stanolind Oil and Gas Company and
began what was to be a long, distinguished geoscientist career.
A certified petroleum geologist and certified professional geoscientist, Mear’s extensive professional career includes 46 years as geologist and manager (35 years in
petroleum, and 5 years hard minerals, 3 years Texas Archeological Research Fellow, and 3 years as consulting geologist.
His resume includes these imposing job assignments:
• 1952-1956—Exploration Geologist (Stanolind Oil and Gas
Company (Amoco Production Co.), Midland, TX.

I worked with Gene Mear at Southland Royalty Company where he was my immediate supervisor. He became a
life-long friend. The proverbial “geologist’s geologist,”
teacher, thinker, field trip leader and author, Gene was well
liked and respected throughout the oil community. Gene was
a great oil finder, manager and scholar. He drilled many
successful wells for the companies he worked for, supervised the work of many professional people, published more
than 33 professional papers, and remained active in his many
professional societies. Although a supervisor for much of his
career, he liked to keep “hands-on” in geology. One of his
favorite tasks was contouring geologic maps. When I would
drop into his office, he would frequently be contouring a
map. He would often look up and say with his warm electric
eraser in his hands, “Oh how I love the smell of burning
rubber.” He was known to use many witty, colorful phrases
and metaphors to make a professional point. To answer a yes
or no question, Gene would often say, “Does a frog have a
water-proof ear” or “Does James Brown get down?”
He minored in Archeology during his studies at The
University of Texas. As a scholarly avocation, Gene main-

tained a keen interest in archeology throughout his life. When
he retired in 1993 as Senior Exploration Vice President of
Cross Timbers Oil Company, he accepted a research fellowship in Archeology at The University of Texas and worked
there until1996.
All his life, he loved sports and remained a rabid, albeit
somewhat of a “closet” Longhorn fan. He treasured The
University of Texas and was proud that several of his children graduated from that institution. He enjoyed watching
college football and attending high school football, basketball and baseball games. Gene also loved to fish, hunt birds
and the outdoors. One of his passions was attending and
often leading geology and archeology field trips. He was
fond of telling stories and told many and sometimes was
chided for telling the same story more than once. Gene had
an uncanny memory. As someone would show him a prospect or drilling deal, he would invariably pick out some dry
hole on their map and say, “Now when this well was
drilled…” Frequently an interesting story would develop
from what was seemingly an uninteresting dry hole.
Mear received the Monroe G. Cheney Science Award,
from the Southwest Section of the American Association of
Petroleum Geologists in 1991 and the Dedicated Service
Award of the West Texas Geological Society in 1982. He
was awarded an honorary life membership Permian Basin
Section of the SEPM in 1982.
Memberships in professional societies are comprised of
the following:
•

SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology)

•

He remained a highly active member throughout his life in
many professional societies.

Gene Mear married his high school sweetheart, Tonie,
who like Gene was valedictorian of her Sabinal high school
class. They had eight children and eight grandchildren. A
consummate family man, he was proud of his children and
their accomplishments.
A scholar, teacher, author, major industry contributor
and a friend to all, he leaves a vacuum in the oil community.

The Fort Bend Society has been busy recently with
searching for a historic cemetery, assisting Boy Scouts with
achieving their Archeology Merit Badge, and working with
the Fort Bend Museum and Houston Museum of Natural
Science on various activities. Outreach activity participation
include Texian Market Days at the George Ranch Historical
Park and the city of Sugar Land’s Memorial Park opening,
with a booth and mock dig box with 150+ kids, right next to
the various moonwalk balloons!
The Houston Society has been busy with a “Time Travelers” project in conjunction with the AIA, and did a pilot
program at Houston Askew Elementary School for 3rd-grade
students. The program consisted of classroom units on ancient cultures with workbooks to be completed by visiting
hands-on study areas covering different aspects of each culture (language, religion, material culture and customs, etc.).
This was followed by a mock dig, where students excavated,
screened, washed, weighed, measured, and documented the
“artifacts” they found. Houston will also be hosting the TAS
Lithics Academy on January 26-27.
The Brazosport Society is continuing their 5-year plan
for documentation of 50+ historical plantation sites in
Brazoria County, under the guidance of Jeff Durst, THC.
Many Region 5 TAS members are looking forward to the
continued plans to document the Stephen F. Austin Historic
Site with the THC in 2008. This task involves locating the
properties of early prominent citizens of San Felipe, under
the guidance of Marianne Marek.

Our First International Rio Grande Delta Archeology
Fair was a milestone with about 500 in attendance that day.
It was held at Palo Alto Battlefield, Saturday, October 13th.
Museums from Brownsville, Port Isabel, and Matamoros,
MX. participated in the events. We received recognition in
the news media, being on page two of the first section of the
Sunday edition of the Brownsville Herald, the day after the
Fair. This was a first for the Brownsville area, and we are
proud of the outcome. It was the first time all the local
museums had ever grouped together in one place.
The Annual Meeting in San Antonio was very informative.
What an opportunity to be able to get in on such a variety of
topics and discussions from around the state and to meet new

folks and see those once again that make being involved in TAS
so worthwhile. The winter season is a great time to prepare for
the coming year’s activities, and to take advantage of available
workshops and seminars. I will be visiting the Corpus Christi
Archeological Society in December and look forward to expanding awareness and preservation across my Region.
As always, I can be reached most anytime to talk to
those interested in upcoming events, or how to get involved.

As the winter season approaches, and the activities associated with Archeology Month and fall conferences is behind us, things are perhaps slowing to a slightly less than
crazed pace. Nonetheless, much of my own time has been
and continues to be spent working on various archeological
survey projects at Big Bend Ranch State Park and other state
parks in far west Texas. Also, with the help of staff at
Seminole Canyon State Park and Historic Site, Joe Labadie,
Amistad National Recreation Area, and Elton Prewitt, Shumla
School, we were able to excavate a series of mechanical
auger tests on an upland burned rock midden site that was
recently discovered in a buried upland setting, a rarity in this
part of the country. Although no diagnostic projectile points
have yet been recovered from this site, the frequency of
endscrapers found on the site suggests that it may date to the
Late Prehistoric period. We are looking forward to conducting additional excavations on this site in the future.
Though a few months away, preparations are underway for
the upcoming TAS Rock Art Academy, to be held in Van Horn
February 28th through March 2nd. Melissa Williams and Reeda
Peel, both from the Center for Big Bend Studies (CBBS), Sul
Ross State University, Alpine, are coordinating this Academy.
The CBBS continues to conduct archeological investigations on some private ranches in the Big Bend region, and
is in the final couple of years of archeological survey work at
Big Bend National Park. Archeological sites in the La Junta
de los Ríos area were the focus of recent remote sensing
activities, the results of which are still pending. Much of the
information gleaned by the CBBS as a result of their research
activities will soon be available to read and view on the
‘Texas Beyond History’ website; the Trans-Pecos exhibit
will include several contributions by the CBBS on the

TAS Education Committee at Science Teachers Convention
The TAS booth at the Conference for the Advancement
of Science Teaching was a huge success in terms of personto-person contact with teachers interested in using archeology in their classroom. About a thousand brochures, posters,
TAS-Texas Beyond History bookmarks, Academy notices,
and other information were distributed to the teachers that
visited the booth.
TARL contributed a 3-D display and artifacts, THC
contributed posters by the hundreds, and TAS contributed
bookmarks, newsletters, and Field School & Academy registration forms. Many thanks to the Travis Co. Archeological
Society volunteers who worked in the booth for two and a
half days; Karen Fustes, Ed Crosby, David Parkhill, Jim
Schmidt, JoAnn & Kelly Carpenter, Elliott Richmond, Ann
& Robin Matthews, Alice Stultz, and Kathleen Hughes, Education Committee member from Aldine.

As an incentive to visit the booth, TAS had a drawing
for two free registrations to attend any Academy. This
generated a list of 225 email addresses. The TAS Education
Committee will keep these on file for a time with plans to
send archeological information to these teachers, including
information about Field School and the Academies and a
reminder that TAS is approved by the state to be a provider
of continuing professional development credit for teachers.
“We had some great conversations with many teachers and received several requests to “come out to my
ranch” to check out possible archeological sites,” said
Robin Matthews, TAS Education Chairman. “We also
put a code on the Academy applications so we can trace
how many teachers from the convention actually attend
any academies,” Robin stated.

The El Paso Museum of Archaeology celebrated its 30th
anniversary in October, and is presently exhibiting ‘Watercolor Paintings of Rock Art at Hueco Tanks.’ The exhibit
will continue until February 16th, 2008. In conjunction with
the present exhibit, the Museum also hosted a mini-conference on the archeology and rock imagery of Hueco Tanks on
December 7th, followed by guided tours to related pictograph sites on December 8th.

For anyone interested, the Baylor University
Center for Spatial Research (CSR) is sponsoring the
following workshops aimed at professional education and development for archaeologists. Dr. Shane
J. Prochnow will instruct both workshops in the
Baylor Sciences Building at Waco, Texas.

Bob Gillespie
Self-proclaimed “Desert Rat” Bob Gillespie, 15
year TAS member, passed away while in hospice
care at home in Burnet on October 27, 2007. Bob
always had a kind word for everyone and a positive
outlook on life as well. Bob was a LUAS stalwart for
many years, helping with excavations, field trips and
student tours. More recently he had become very
involved in rock art recording, and we saw less of
him as he pursued his passion. Bob was a joy to be
with, infinitely polite, always interested in your life,
and just an all around great guy. Bob had been in
declining health in recent months. He leaves behind
his wife Laurah, several children and grandchildren.
