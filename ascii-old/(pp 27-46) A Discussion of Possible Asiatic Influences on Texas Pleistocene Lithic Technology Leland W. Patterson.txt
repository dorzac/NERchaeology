A DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE ASIATIC INFLUENCES
ON TEXAS PLEISTOCENE LITHIC TECHNOLOGY
LELAND W. PATTERSON

ABSTRACT
Details of the lithic technology from an archeological site of possible
Pleistocene age in Medina County, Texas are presented. This lithic
collection is similar to assemblages from the early Upper Paleolithic of
northeast Asia, with some Mousterian-like elements. This Texas lithic
technology may be related to an Asiatic migration to the New World at
approximately 25,000 B.C., as proposed by Borden and Muller-Beck.

INTRODUCTION
Over the years, there has been a great amount of speculation on
the origin of the Paleo-lndian lithic tradition in the New World,
with early dates for use of fluted projectile points, as summarized
by Haynes (1967). References are too numerous to summarize, and
they provide a number of differing opinions. While there seems to
be a consensus that early peopling of the New World was from
Asia, there is not general agreement on the chronology or
subsequent technological developments (Wormington 1971). Borden
(1969) has pointed out that there is increasing evidence for people
being in southern North America during the last glaciation, when
the route to Asia may have been blocked by ice. Borden proposed a
Protowestern Tradition crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia
to Alaska at about 25,000 B.C., and proceeding southward through
the intermontane plateau of British Columbia, to become the
forerunner of the Paleo-lndian tradition in southern North America.
This paper will consider some evidence from Texas for the PaleoIndian deriving from a movement from Asia at some time before the
terminal Pleistocene, at a period when an ice-free passage to
southern North America was available.
While reports on Paleo-lndian sites south of Canada are
becoming more numerous (cf. Kraft 1973 and Frison 1974), with the
exception of Dragoo (1973a,b) there have been few serious attempts
to compare these collections with others, in an effort to find
technological sources. Probably because of the proximity to Asia,
more work has been done in the far north to characterize early
lithic assemblages of possible Asiatic derivation. This includes
reports by MacNeish (1964), West (1973a,b), Anderson (1970), and
Irving (1971). Even more work has been done on post-Pleistocene

Asiatic contacts with North America, especially microblade
technology as recently summarized by Smith (1974).
Muller-Beck (1966) proposed the movement of Upper Paleolithic
people over the Bering land bridge to the New World at
approximately

25,000 B.C.,

with lithic

technology having some

Mousterian-like elements. Rudenko (1961: 209) has noted the
presence of Mousterian traits in the Siberian Upper Paleolithic.
Borden (1969: 6-9) then hypothesizes the possible movement of
these people southward into western North America. The PaleoIndian fluted point is viewed as a subsequent indigenous
development, especially prominent east of the Rocky Mountains.
Borden has named the original lithic technology arriving from Asia
the "Proto-western Tradition." Principal lithic traits are: "large
biface knives and leaf-shaped points, scrapers in a wide range of
size and type, occasionally crude or even well made blades, but
never microblades. Varying quantities of pebble tools are usually
present." (Borden 1969: 8). Chapman (1975: Fig. 2-3) presents a
similar collection of traits as being available for export from Asia
in the early Upper Paleolithic.
Hadleigh-West (1973a,b) has reported on similar early type lithic
materials in the Tangle Lakes area of Alaska. This has been named
the Amphi-theater Mountain Complex, and is described as a late
Middle Paleolithic stone industry. Hadleigh-West notes the possible
Asiatic affiliation of this Technology. Soviet archeologists would
seem to be noting Mousterian-like elements in the Upper Paleolithic
in northeast Asia, with terms such as "Epi-Levallois cores" (Powers
1974: 31). Hadleigh-West (personal communication) feels that this is
an unfortunate choice of terminology, as these cores are simply
generalized forms from the Upper Paleolithic. Chard (1974: 207)
does not see any clear cut Asiatic lithic tradition affiliations with
North America before terminal Pleistocene time. MacNeish (1976)
describes a Pleistocene "Stage Ill" lithic tradition with blades,
burins, and leaf-shaped points found throughout the Americas that
fits well with Bordenâs Protowest Tradition. DâAmare (1965) has
noted Mousterian-like elements in early lithic assemblages of the
Americas.
I feel that a body of evidence now exists to support the concept
of Asiatic early Upper Paleolithic technology as the forerunner of
Paleo-lndian technology, with fluted points evolving from leafshaped points. Wormington (1962) has previously discussed this
hypothetical evolution of projectile points. Borden (1969: 8) has
given possible examples of this tradition in North America, and his
Protowestern label seems to be an appropriate and handy title.

SITE 41 ME 3, MEDINA CO. TEXAS
There is a site with an undated surface collection in central
Texas that appears to have all of the qualifying traits of the early
lithic tradition being discussed. This assemblage can best be
described as similar to an Asiatic early Upper Paleolithic
collection, with several Mousterian-like elements. Site 41 ME 3 in
Medina County, Texas was originally published {Patterson 1975} as
a brief survey of a quarry site, with Paleo-Indian type prismatic
blade technology. Enough additional material has now been found
on this site to propose that it is also a hilltop campsite.
Appropriately, a hilltop campsite would match the concept of early
occupation, as later Archaic period sites in central Texas seem
more oriented to lower riverine adaptation. Irving and Cinq-Mars
{1974: 65} and Dragoo (1973a: 46} have noted the tendency in other
locations for early sites to be on high ground as "lookout" sites,
1. F. Epstein (personal communication} has noted high elevation
Paleo-Indian sites in northern Mexico, and Patterson and Adams
{1977) have described an archeological complex of this nature in
Kendall County, Texas. 1. I. Hester (1975: 249} has noted the tendency
of Paleo-Indian campsites in the southern high plains to be located on
high ground as possible "lookout" sites.
Site 41 ME 3 is located in the rolling foothills on the southern
edge of the central Texas hill country, at the boundary of the
Edwards Plateau. The surface geology is Cretaceous, with a thin
layer of more recent soil. Lithic raw materials are available as flint
nodules in the weathered limestone. The area presently supports a
large deer population, and earlier, large herd animals were
probably present, such as buffalo and elk, and possibly Pleistocene
fauna such as horse and elephant. Because of the thin soil layer
and because of limited time available to the writer, work on this
site has been limited to surface collection. No materials suitable for
radiocarbon dating have been found. Although only a surface
collection is available, the lithic artifacts comprise a rather
homogeneous technology, and it is felt that only one cultural
tradition is present.
Lithic traits of site 41 ME 3 appropriate to the concept of the
Protowestern Tradition are:
1. Mousterian-like technology
a. discoidal cores
b. thick flake scrapers, steeply retouched by percussion
c. Mousteroid points
d. notched tools
e. denticulates

2. Primitive prismatic blade technology, using direct percussion,
with Siberian type prepared platform cores (Powers 1974: 31).
3. An assortment of leaf-shaped and cordiform bifaces from
handaxe to projectile point size
4. Pebble tools (chopper-like cores}
5. No microblades
A statistically significant lithic sample has been obtained from site
41 ME 3, as summarized in Tables I and II. All material is flint,
principally of grey, black, and brown single colors. While the overall
site is very large, winding around a ridge for some 3000 feet, the main
concentration of artifacts is in an area of approximately 400 by 600
feet, where the natural outcropping of flint nodules is densest. This
collection is rather unique, for the possible early lithic technology
represented, in that the complete technology is available for study;
including finished artifacts, preforms, cores, and chipping debitage.
Direct percussion was used extensively, and there is no evidence of
pressure flaking. This is confirmed not only by retouch patterns on
artifacts, but also by the analysis of small percussion flakes under 18
mm square in size {Patterson and Sollberger ms}, and no evidence of
any pressure flakes. Heat treating of flint was used. Several pieces of
flint have reddened discoloration and "potlidded" surfaces typical of
excessive, non-useful thermal alteration. A large number of flint
flakes may show heat treating because of their waxy luster. Some of
the artifacts are shown in Figures 1 to 5, including all of the principal
diagnostic types.
Several of the artifact types present have been illustrated by Klein
(1973: Figs. 6,7) as being typical of the Mousterian, including a large
variety of steeply retouched flint flake scrapers, discoidal cores,
notches, and denticulates. Both cutting and scraping edge retouch
patterns are present on the irregular flint flakes summarized in Table
If, with the greatest number indicating possible scraper function. All
of the scraper shapes illustrated by Klein for the Mousterian are
present, in various combinations of straight, convex, and concave
edges. Mousteroid points resemble ones shown by Bordes (1972) from
several European Mousterian sites. Laughlin (1975) has demonstrated
these points to be present in the New World, at Anangula in the
Aleutians. A large variety of bifaces Is present on site 41 ME 3 in
various sizes, most with leaf-shaped and condiform outlines. Large
bifaces have been called handaxes in the Texas hill country for a
number of years. The unifacial ovoid scrapers are domed-shaped,
resembling turtle shells, and are possible examples of the Levallois
flake technique. A few burins are present. One dihedral burin on a
prismatic blade segment has been identified by J. F. Epstein (personal

communication) of the University of Texas at Austin. Alexander
(1974) feels that burins are firmly established in North American
Pleistocene assemblages. Leaf-shaped projectile points are the major
type, all with the characteristic stepped retouch from use of direct
hard percussion. Some of these points have slight stems, formed by
removal of small amounts of material on the lateral edges, but there is
no basal grinding. Four percussion-made triangular bifaces present
probably represent projectile points and preforms.

Blade-like flakes shown in Table II consist of prismatic flakes too
short to be classified as blades, and miscellaneous elongated flakes
with parallel lateral edges. A true prismatic blade industry is also
present, mostly in the form of large wide blades. This is very
different from the small blades of the Archaic period in this same
Texas hill country, and on the upper Texas coast. Differences in
Texas blade technologies have been discussed in a previous paper
(Patterson 1976). Both single and multiple facet striking platforms
were used, with more cores and blades showing use of single facet
platforms. Typical blade cores are semi-conical in shape, with the
striking platform formed simply by a single blow to remove the end
of a flint nodule. Almost all blades have retouch on one or both
lateral edges, and over 30% also show use as end scrapers.

The lithic collection from site 41 ME 3 consists of 1383 artifacts
and many pieces of small chipping debitage. Compared to other
Texas collections, it can be classified as a very heavy tool industry.
It remains to be determined if this site is a true Protowestern type
site (pre-Clovis) or a later site following the Protowestern tradition.
Site 41 ME 3 may not be an isolated phenomenon. Nearby sites
have a number of the same lithic traits as site 41 ME 3, with no
sign of pressure flaking or other later lithic traits. As with site 41
ME 3, these other sites could be considered as simple quarry sites
because of chipping debitage at locations where lithic raw material
occurs naturally. However, practically all flint flakes show signs of
wear and heavy retouch, and lithic tool kits are present, not just
specialized quarry activity remains.

TECHNOLOGICAL COMPARISONS
A number of comparisons are possible for the lithic technology of
site 41 ME 3 with other lithic collections to show both similarities
and contrasts. Lithic flake thickness is an important attribute.
Texas middle to late Archaic sites surveyed by the writer can be
classified as thin flake industries, with most flake thicknesses
ranging from 2 to 5 mm. This is in sharp contrast with the average
flake thickness of 11.7 mm for site 41 ME 3. Wilmsen (1970: Table
7) has summarized several Paleo4ndian collections with thick
flakes, although considerable variation is shown. Flake size may
also be important. Archaic period sites in this Texas hill country
surveyed by the writer have few flakes over 40 mm square
(Patterson and Adams 1977), and the large number of flakes over 50
mm square on site 41 ME 3 may be an indication of earlier lithic
technology.
Frank C. Hibben (personal communication) of the University of
New Mexico sees similarities of the overall lithic technology of site
41 ME 3 with the Sandia, including prismatic blades, leaf-shaped
bifaces, denticulates, and Mousteroid points. This is consistent with
the Pleistocene nature of site 41 ME 3 proposed here. Although
there is not general agreement that the Sandia has pre-Clovis
dating, it is at least firmly within the Pleistocene period.
There is a general resemblance of many flakes from site 41 ME 3
with the scrapers described by Alexander (1963) for the Levi PaleoIndian site in central Texas. Alexander shows a number of
basically leaf-shaped points in this collection. Alexander (personal
communication) has recently done work on a pre-Clovis stratum at
the Levi site, but only crude utilized flakes and bone tools were

37

found. Carl H. Chapman (personal communication) of the University
of Missouri has informed me that there is a site (Shriver site} in
northwest Missouri which appears to underlie fluted points, that
has lithic technology that may be similar to site 41 ME 3, but I have
not yet been able to obtain any detailed information on the
Missouri site.

The Wells Creek site in Tennessee reported by Dragoo (1973a) is
a Paleo-Indian site with Clovis fluted points. It also has leaf-shaped
bifaces, large prismatic blades, thick flake scrapers, discoidal
cores, and polyhedral cores. Dragoo (1973b} has discussed possible
Asiatic affiliations for the cores. This site could represent the
evolved form of the Protowestern tradition. Like site 41 ME 3, the
Wells Creek site has beaked, notched, and denticulate flake tools.
Westâs (1973a,b) early Amphitheater Mountain complex in Alaska
also contains these tool types.
Paleo-Indian prismatic blade technology is of the large type, with
blades generally grouping over 20 mm in width (Converse 1973: 14,
Green 1963, Hammatt 1969, Kraft 1973}. This is a statistical
grouping and some smaller blades can be present. Cores to produce
these large blades are similar to the "Epi-Levallois" Siberian cores
(Powers 1974: 31}, where examples are available. Examples of
cores of this type in North America that might fit the Protowestern
Tradition have been given by Hadleigh-West (1973a: P1. III), Dragoo
(1973a: Fig. 27), Chapman (1975: Pig. 4-13}, and Patterson (1975:
Fig. 2}. These are polyhedral cores from which large blades have
been detached, with acute angle striking platforms. There is a
minimum of purposeful striking platform edge preparation, at least
on the Texas examples. This type of blade technology can be
replicated by direct hard percussion (Sollberger and Patterson
1976, Crabtree and Swanson 1968}. Some microblades can be
produced fortuitously in small quantities, but not as a distinct
industry.
One prominent attribute on blades using this
manufacturing technique is the high percentage of striking
platforms crushed on the dorsal surface, leaving a thin or
negligible residual striking platform on the blade. For example,
50% of the blades from site 41 ME 3 have crushed striking
platforms. It has been proposed {Sollberger and Patterson 1976}
that blade technology introduced into southern North America
before the terminal Pleistocene employed direct percussion
exclusively, and that indirect percussion and pressure techniques
for smaller blades were technologies introduced from Asia in postPleistocene time. These later technological introductions apply
south of the main glaciation. Lithic techniques could have arrived
earlier in Alaska before there was an ice-free passage to the south
at the end of the last glaciation, and West 1973a: 10) shows dates
for the Denali tradition with microblades as early as 9000 B.C.

The lithic elements mentioned here as deriving from a
Protowestern tradition in formation of the Paleo-Indian traditions in
southern North America can be noted in a number of Paleo-Indian
collections. Irwin and Wormington (1970), for example, summarize
Paleo-Indian tools from the Plains area, with many of the tool types

40

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

mentioned for the Protowestern tradition. Kraft (1973) shows
similar tool types for a Paleo-Indian site in New Jersey. There are
several reasons why few comparisons have been made between
lithic technologies of northeast Asia and the Paleo-Indian of
southern North America. First of all is the small amount of data
previously available for both areas. In North America, many PaleoIndian kill sites simply did not yield complete lithic collections.
Secondly, there has been a general failure to note Pleistocene type
lithic technology in North America if not associated with fluted
points. Also, more attention has been given to projectile points than
to other basic lithic technology. Much more attention has been
given to the variability of lithic traits, such as projectile points, in
Paleo-Indian collections than in recognizing the basic continuity of
this lithic tradition. Some of this continuity has been recognized.
Jennings (1974: 133) notes that terminal Pleistocene prismatic
blades are similar to Clovis examples. Finally, in comparing
Pleistocene lithic collections, a great amount of impressionistic
personal opinions have been given, instead of detailed technical
analyses.
Two direct comparisons can be made of sites in northeast Asia
with site 41 ME 3. One is that every lithic component of the Ustâ
Kanskaia site (Rudenko 1961), which is represented as a Siberian
early Upper Paleolithic collection, is also present in the collection
of site 41 ME 3. This includes: discoidal implements, massive flake
tools, large prismatic blades, Mousteroid points, leaf-shaped
bifaces, burins, beaked tools (perforators), notched tools, and
chopping, scraping and cutting tools. Another comparison that can
be made for site 41 ME 3 is with the Dyuktai Upper Paleolithic
culture (Mochanov 1973) of northeast Asia. Comparable lithic
components are: leaf-shaped points, triangular points, large
bifaces, large prismatic blades, pebble tools, burins, large
scrapers, large flake knives, denticulates, discoidal cores, and
polyhedral large blade cores. The later Dyuktai type sites at
approximately 11,000 to 12,000 B.C. have a microblade industry
using Gobi type wedge-shaped cores, while site 41 ME 3 does not
have a microblade component. This may be interpreted that the
Texas site is related to the early end of the Dyuktai culture at
approximately 25,000 B.C., before the development of microblade
technology. Mochanov (1973: 12) has noted the general similarity of
the Dyuktai lithic technology with New World Paleo-Indian
technology, except for microblades.
It would seem desirable to compare the site 41 ME 3 lithic
collection with quarry-workshop sites commonly found in central

TEXAS PLEISTOCENE LITHIC TECHNOLOGY

41

Texas. However, surprisingly little has been published on quarryworkshop sites. There is a series of reports on quarry-workshops in
Comal County (Hester, Bass and Kelly 1975, Kelly and Hester
1975a,b) with many sites in a complex of apparent Archaic age.
There are apparently two classes of quarry-workshops found in
central Texas. One type is primarily a quarry-workshop, which may
or may not also have been the scene of some lithic tool use. The
other type is a campsite located at or near lithic source areas,
where complete lithic reductions to finished tools and much tool
use occurs. The Comal County quarry-workshops are of the first
type of site, and site 41 ME 3 is of the second type. Several
comparisons can be made between site 41 ME 3 and the Comal
sites:
i. While no detailed data were given for the Comal sites, and
large flake tools are present, I have the impression that the
flakes generally tend to be smaller than the distribution given
in Table II for site 41 ME 3, as small flake tools and a small
blade core are mentioned for the Comal sites. I feel that flake
size distributions are important information rarely given in
archeological reports. The flake size distribution of site 41 ME
3 runs much larger than for Archaic campsites surveyed by
the author in Bandera and Kendall Counties.
2. A number of lithic components found at site 41 ME 3 are not
present on the Comal sites, indicating a more complex tool kit
for the Medina County site. Items not present on the Comal
sites include burins, beaks and gravers, and Mousteroid
(Mousterian-like) points. The Comal sites also do not have a
well defined industry for making and using large prismatic
blades in significant quantities.
3. Site 41 ME 3 has a collection of irregular shaped lithic flakes
with 9.7% primary cortex flakes, 43.5% secondary cortex
flakes, and 46.8% interior flakes. This tends to show a greater
emphasis on the lithic reduction process at site 41 ME 3 than
at the Comal quarry-workshop sites, where primary flakes
averaged 23Â°/âo (Kelly and Hester 1975b: 13).
4. The high percentage of flakes utilized as tools on site 41 ME 3
would certainly not be expected on sites which are predominantly quarry-workshops, and this is not evidenced on the
Comal sites.
5. As a summary comment, published quarry-workshop sites in
south-central Texas, which seem to be mainly of Archaic age,
simply do not have the "Protowestern" mix of lithic technology.

CONCLUSIONS
From the above discussion, it is proposed that the list of
Pleistocene tradition lithic traits in the New World that are
possibly derived from northeast Asia include the following
elements:
1. discoidal cores
2. thick large flake scrapers, steeply retouched by percussion
and in wide variety
3. leaf-shaped and cordiform bifaces and projectile points
4. triangular points
5. large prismatic blades
6. crude polyhedral blade cores, prepared platforms
7. pebble tools, chopper-like
8. no microblade industry (some small blades could be present}
9. notched tools
10. denticulate tools
11. absence of specialized bifacial projectile points with flutes or
distinctive stem types
12. beaked tools
13. no significant fine pressure flaking
14. generally thick heavy lithic flake industry
15. burins may be present
16. sometimes Mousteroid points
Many of these traits have long continuity into the later Archaic
period in North America, so that the combination of traits in the
total lithic collection is the important feature of the Protowestern
tradition, along with the absence of traits generally accepted as
starting later. Dragoo {1973: 53} thinks that there may be some of
these type of heavy tool industry sites in Tennessee. It is hoped that
this article will stimulate others to be alert for this type of lithic
collection. As shown here, sites do exist in southern North America
which fit Bordenâs criteria for Protowestern assemblages, and work
should be done to establish confirming chronology.
