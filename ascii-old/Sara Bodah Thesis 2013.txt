GOLIAD WARE FROM MISSION ESPÍRITU SANTO DE ZÚÑIGA (41GD1),
GOLIAD COUNTY, TEXAS: A RIM SHERD ANALYSIS
OF FUNCTIONAL ATTRIBUTES

As native groups of the Toyah horizon entered the Spanish missions in Texas, it is
expected that their ceramics would show evidence of selective pressures related to increased
sedentism and reliance on agriculture, namely corn. It is expected that within the mission
setting, jars would be larger and greater in number than bowls due to the substantial amounts of
time required to steep corn to render its full nutrition and digestibility. It is also expected that
vessels would have thinner walls to cope with the thermal stresses of cooking, namely steeping
corn. To examine this expectation, functional attributes of Goliad Plain rim sherds from Mission
Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga (41GD1) were analyzed. The results surprisingly
deviate from ceramic expectations of mobile hunter gatherers becoming increasingly more
sedentary and reliant on agriculture. Specifically the results indicate that all the Goliad vessels
types were rather small and uniform in size. Additionally the results indicate that jars do not
number significantly greater than bowls and that vessel wall thickness remains rather uniform.
This could possibly suggest that the Indigenous mission inhabitants relied on the mission for
central food storage and distribution. However to understand the degree to which the Indigenous
mission inhabitants depended economically on the mission requires further research.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
Modern day Texas is still steeped in the effects of historical Spanish presence. Much of
this historical Spanish presence, including the close relationship with the Catholic Franciscans,
has been impressed upon the people and landscape of Texas. This Spanish influence is still quite
visible today as evidenced though things such as food, culture, county names, and mission ruins.
It seems easy to forget that prior to the Spanish and mission presence there were great
populations of native groups existing within this region. Unfortunately many Indigenous groups
of this area have been relegated to mere mention in historical accounts as little or no historical
documentation exists for them. It is by examining the material culture left by these groups that
we can hope to gain a better understanding of who they were.
As such, this thesis focuses on the native made ceramics ubiquitous across the San
Antonio area and some coastal Spanish missions in Texas, specifically the native Goliad ware
found at Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga (41GD1) in Goliad County, Texas. Given that the
Aranama were the predominant native presence at this final location of Mission Espíritu Santo,
and that Goliad ware was named as such due to the abundance of this native ceramic type found
at this mission, the two are assumed to be related (Mounger 1959). Additionally, Goliad
ceramics associated with the Aranama of the protohistoric mission period are assumed to be a
continuation of the late prehistoric Leon Plain ceramics of the Toyah horizon (Black 1982).
However, further research, both historical and archaeological must be conducted to aid in piecing
together a more precise picture.
This thesis has been designed not only to set the stage for further research, but also to
discuss the evolutionary implications of changing subsistence practices and increased sedentism
as evidenced in native made ceramics. Within this thesis, historical background has been
1

combined with archaeological research to learn more about not only the native Goliad Plain
ceramic type, but also the native people creating and utilizing these ceramics. As people are
subject to evolution and different selective pressures, so are the ceramics created by them, as
these ceramics are an extension of phenotype (Dunnell 1978). By conducting a rim sherd
analysis of Goliad Plain ceramics and focusing on the formal attributes of these ceramics which
may have been under selection, the data is then available not only for comparison within this
assemblage, but also for comparison with other mission sites. Furthermore, this data is also
available for comparison with an analogous prehistoric Leon Plain assemblage which would
enable the examination of frequency changes over time.
The history of Spanish presence in Texas as related to Mission Nuestra Señora del
Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga is discussed in Chapter Two. This includes not only the initial Spanish
footsteps impressed upon the land, but also the Spanish Franciscan missions in Texas. Also
addressed within this chapter is the history of Mission Espíritu Santo including its relocations.
Chapters Three and Four are related to the native groups associated with Mission Espíritu
Santo. In Chapter Three, the specific focus is on the native Aranama as they are the native group
most closely aligned with this mission. Though little is known regarding the Aranama, this
chapter is intended to provide as much information possible concerning this native group.
Chapter Four begins with a very general discussion of Goliad ware, including how it was made,
before moving on to discuss Leon Plain ceramics and Goliad ware’s likely relation. In this
chapter I also address the Aranama as the probable creators of Goliad ware.
Chapter Five addresses the theoretical perspective employed in conducting this Goliad
rim sherd analysis. The premise of evolutionary archaeology is that the basic tenets of biological
evolution can be applied to material culture analogously, as material culture should be viewed as
2

an extension of phenotype. Employing an evolutionary archaeological perspective to this
analysis, means examining functional attributes of pottery as evidenced in rim sherds.
Selected functional attributes of Goliad rim sherds were examined in this analysis and are
discussed in Chapter Six. This chapter discusses the methods employed in the conducting this
rim sherd analysis as well as why these attributes were selected. Additionally, mention is made
as to how these attributes could relate to studies in evolutionary archaeology. Data was recorded
for the following attributes: vessel form, rim profile, chord width, sherd length, sherd width, rim
thickness at 2, 15, and 22 millimeters from the lip, minimum and maximum orifice diameter, as
well as lip treatment. This data is presented in Appendix A, and basic descriptive statistics of
this data are presented in Appendices B through G. Additional attributes recorded include
degree of interior or exterior surface treatment, sooting presence and location, and also an ordinal
number categorization for differing neck lengths for direct rim necked jars.
The results of this rim sherd analysis are displayed in Chapter Seven. In this chapter, the
functional attributes are combined and compared across vessel form (deep bowls, shallow bowls,
necked jars, and neckelss jars), vessel type (a term employed referring to the resultant
combination of rim profile with vessel form – such as an everted rim deep bowl), and also lip
treatment. Overall the rather general uniformity of this ceramic type is quite surprising as most
attributes examined have similar means or proportions.
In conclusion, Chapter Eight summarizes and discusses the findings within this thesis
including an overview of results of the rim sherd analysis. These results are also compared with
other Goliad research findings. Also discussed, is the relation of evolutionary archaeology to
these findings and what this might mean in terms of the people who created Goliad ware and
what selective pressure might have shaped these ceramics.

CHAPTER TWO: THE SPANISH IN TEXAS
In 1519 Alonso Álvarez de Piñeda sailed and mapped the coast of the Gulf of Mexico,
setting the stage for years of Spanish presence in the geographic location known as current day
Texas (Hester 1989:199). Though Piñeda never actually touched Texas soil, this is often
considered the earliest claim to Spanish Texas (Woods 2011:34-35; Chipman and Joseph
2010:24-25).
The earliest exploration of actual Texas land is credited to Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca
in 1528 when he shipwrecked near the area of Galveston Island (Walter 2007:8). After nearly all
the crew died or attempted retreat to Mexico, Cabeza de Vaca, along with three survivors, also
decided to make their way back. Delayed by capture from native groups, Cabeza de Vaca and
the three men eventually explored their way back to Mexico in 1536 (Bannon 1997:12; Chipman
and Joseph 2010:21; Walter 2007:7). Throughout their Texas expedition, Cabeza de Vaca
recorded a wealth of information on the area, including the geography, topography, flora, fauna,
and people (Chipman and Joseph 2010:16). Subsequent famed Spanish expeditions through
Northern New Spain and surrounding areas, such of those of Franciso Vázquez de Coronado and
Hernando de Soto disproved prospects of gold and silver in this region (Bannon 1997:28; Foster
1995:1; Mounger 1959:8; Woods 2011:35). As a result of this lack of wealth to be gained, this
area of Northern New Spain lay relatively dormant in Spanish development and expansion for
quite some time (Eaton 1989:249; O’Connor 1966:2). It would not be until many years later,
provoked by the French, that Spain would begin missionizing Texas.
The arrival of LaSalle’s shipwrecked voyage on the Texas Gulf coast rekindled Spain’s
interest in the region. Early in 1685, René Robert Cavelier, sieur de La Salle entered Matagorda
Bay and subsequently shipwrecked (Arnold 1996:68; Bannon 1997:96). La Salle’s voyage was
4

intended to find the mouth of the Mississippi River. Speculation exists regarding La Salle’s true
destination intention, as the kingdoms of France and Spain at that time were in the midst of
animosity (Chipman and Joseph 2010:69; Clark 1902:175; O’Connor 1966:2, Foster 1995:1).
LaSalle did in fact establish a colony near Matagorda Bay, which at that time was referred to as
la Bahia del Espíritu Santo (O’Connor 1966:2). Garcitas Creek, “about five miles up from its
mouth, or entrance into the bay” (O’Connor 1966:2), is where La Salle founded Fort Saint Louis.
Subject to a host of misfortunes, in addition to the wreck of their ship the Belle, the French
colonists suffered disease, dysentery, and hostility by natives (Chipman and Joseph 2010:70-71;
Walter 2007:8). Only a few short years after it was established, Fort Saint Louis failed (Arnold
1996:68; Walter 2007:8).
Spanish officials were made privy to the French encroachment and establishment of Fort
Saint Louis later in 1685. “If the French gained a toehold in the gulf, they would certainly
reinforce it with additional supplies and manpower as soon as possible. Urgency dictated that
the viceroy of New Spain not wait for crown authorization; instead, plans were immediately
formulated to extirpate the foreign colony” (Chipman and Joseph 2010:71-72). Expeditions
ensued to find La Salle’s French colony in New Spain (Clark 1902:176), including nine total
unsuccessful expeditions; four by land and five by sea (Foster 1995:16). By the time Alonso de
León’s Spanish entrada (expedition) actually located LaSalle’s Fort Saint Louis on Garcitas
Creek in 1689 (Arnold 1996:68), it had already been destroyed and abandoned (Walter 2007:12;
Foster 1995:27; Hester 1989:199). Alonso de León was later instructed to burn the remains of
Fort Saint Louis (O’Connor 1966:6).
Years later, from 1719-1722, largely in response to further French intrusion in the eastern
regions of Northern New Spain, the marqués de San Miguel de Aguayo, led his famed
5

expedition, establishing and reestablishing missions and presidios in northern New Spain
(Chipman and Joseph 2010:119-127). It was during this expedition that the marqués de Aguayo
was to erect a presidio upon the exact location of the ruined Fort Saint Louis (Chipman and
Joseph 2010:128). This would become the first location of the Presidio Nuestra Señora de
Loreto de la Bahía del Espíritu Santo (O’Connor 1966:10; Walter 2007:12).
Spanish Missions in Texas
Prior to Spanish presence in current day Texas, many Indigenous populations resided
within this geographic location. The Spanish Mission System in Texas was established not only
to Christianize these local native populations, but also intended for these newly converted natives
to then become devoted Spanish citizens. Spain’s intention was that once assimilated into the
mission system, these new citizens would then defend Spanish lands from foreign threats such as
those of French and English invasion (O’Rourke 1927:82; Walter 2007:8).
The Spanish mission system in Texas was quite expansive. Though the earliest missions
built were located in west Texas, by the late seventeenth century and early eighteenth century,
many of the East Texas and San Antonio area missions had been established (Bannon 1997:115118; Hester 1989:204). All the missions had their fair share of success, but also much hardship
and struggle and many endured periods of relocation involving both the mission and typical
corresponding presidio.
The Texas landscape and environment proved harsh on the new Spanish settlers and
many hostile native groups inhibited complete success of many of these Spanish missions
(Walter 2007:10). The missions were not entirely unsuccessful as most of current day Texas still
retains Spanish influence as visible in Texan nomenclature and religion (Chipman and Joseph
2010:274-275). However the missions did encounter hostile native groups, namely the Lipan
6

Apache and Comanche which at times impeded the success of the missions (Mounger 1959:80;
Walter 2007:10). Many of the local native groups that the Spanish were attempting to “civilize”
were not accustomed to sedentary lifeways. Many of these native groups either never entered the
mission (Hester 1989:201), or often deserted the missions for various lengths of time, if not
entirely (Eaton 1989:246-247; Mounger 1959:76).
The Spanish missions were intended not merely to Christianize various native
populations via baptism, but more specifically, were indoctrinating them in the Roman Catholic
faith (Chipman 2010:23, Walter 2007:10-11). The Spanish crown was largely a Roman Catholic
empire with ties to the order of Franciscan friars (O’Rourke 1927:80), named for their patron
saint, Saint Francis of Assisi. Two colleges of Franciscan friars were commonly employed to
found these missions. Both located in Mexico, the friars were either from of the College of
Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe at Zacatecas (College of Zacatecas) and those from the Apostolic
College of the Querétaro (College of Querétaro) (Chipman and Joseph 2010:112; Eaton
1989:249; O’Rourke 1927:18). It was these two orders of Franciscans that were entrusted to
carry out the missionary works within Coahuila and Texas (Eaton 1989:249).
In addition to propagating the Roman Catholic faith among the native tribes in northern
New Spain, the missionaries were also teaching these largely hunter-gatherer tribes to become
“civilized” (Walter 2007:10-11). This essentially entailed educating the indigenous populations
on Spanish and Catholic cultural norms so that they would conform to the standards of loyal
Spanish citizens. The presidios were established not only to help establish and support a viable
mission, but also to help protect the mission. The Spanish often sent or enlisted accompanying
soldiers to reside within these presidios and sometimes the mission compounds themselves

7

(Eaton 1989:247). Generally speaking, the “Spanish Colonial missions were not just places but
institutions where people, lived, worked, and worshipped” (Walter 2007:187).
As discussed by Eaton (1989) and Bannon (1997), “the mission complex consisted of a
church, monastery (friary), granary, workshops, storerooms, and Indian housing” (Eaton
1989:248). Lands within close proximity to the mission were used for raising livestock as well
as for agriculture (Eaton 1989:248). Additionally as noted by Walter, crafts and trades were
taught within the mission such as carpentry, tailoring, and black-smithing (Walter 2007:12; see
also O’Rourke 1927:89). As originally stated by O’Rourke and later quoted by Walter (2007:11)
regarding the implementation of missions throughout Spanish Texas, “the style of buildings
erected, the system of catechetics employed, the crafts and trades taught the Indians, and the
regulations followed in the admission of the Indians to Baptism, were practically all alike in the
twenty odd Texas mission centers” (O’Rourke 1927:77). Essentially, the missionary work was
aimed at fully converting and integrating the native populations into modern Spanish colonial
life, including but not limited to, language, religious belief, dress, behavior, sedentism, and
subsistence. Furthermore, though the missions may have differed from one another in specific
architecture, they essentially all followed the same ascribed methods and guidelines for
establishing a mission.
Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga
As previously mentioned, to protect the Spanish lands and resources and deter further
potential invasions (Bruseth et al. 2004:78; O’Rourke 1927; Walter 2007:1), the area of
LaSalle’s unfortunate colony became the precise location of Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto
de la Bahía del Espíritu, (La Bahía or simply Bahía) (Chipman and Joseph 2010:124, Buckley
1911:58). By establishing a Spanish colony there, the French were clearly being sent a message
8

that these were indeed Spanish lands. Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga, also
referred to as Mission Espíritu Santo or simply Espíritu Santo, was also established within close
proximity to presidio La Bahía. The precise original location of Mission Espíritu Santo however,
has yet to be discovered (Foster 1995:156; Walter 2007:12).
During Aguayo’s expedition, he had sent a detachment of troops to move ahead and
reach Espíritu Santo Bay where La Salle had built his colony. This detachment actually reached
and repossessed Espíritu Santo Bay in the early Spring of 1721, where they then established a
temporary fort (Mounger 1959:13; O’Connor 1966:9). After occupying the area for a few
months, orders came to erect a permanent presidio, which was apparently undertaken within a
year’s time (Mounger 1959:14; O’Connor 1966:10). The first formal location of La Bahía’s
mission, Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga, was established in 1722 along
Garcitas Creek off of Matagorda Bay (Chipman and Joseph 2010:124). According to O’Connor,
an official ceremony date of April 10, 1722 was decided by the Governor to formally mark the
completion of the mission (1966:10).
This original location1 however would not be its final location. Mission Espíritu Santo de
Zúñiga, along with its presidio La Bahía actually experienced a few relocations. Espíritu Santo
lasted only four years at the original Garcitas Creek location (O’Connor 1966:12; Foster 1995).
Aside from the local natives’ hostility and disinterest with sedentary mission life, failure at this
location was due to reasons such as sickness, lack of rain and resultant crop failure, as well as
difficulty obtaining supplies (Mounger 1959:16). By the time an official inspection was
conducted by the Spanish government, much of the presidio was found in disrepair and also

1

Though the exact location of Presidio La Bahía has been determined to be the same exact location as La Salle’s
failed colony, the precise original location of Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga still remains undiscovered and
therefore lacks the traditional archaeological trinomial for a Texas site.

9

strife existed between the Spanish and the native Karankawa. Furthermore, as noted by Mounger
(1959:17-18), the actual location was realized to be a poor decision. O’Connor states that “the
Franciscan Fathers soon found that work with these wandering tribes would be in vain and
recommended that the Mission be moved to a more favorable locality” (1966:13).
In 1726 Mission Espíritu Santo was moved to a new location (Hester et al. 1996:3;
O’Rourke 1927:52). This time it would be located along the Guadalupe River2 (Fox and Tomka
2006:35). Presidio La Bahía relocated as well and it became situated across the Guadalupe River
from Mission Espríritu Santo about two miles downstream (Fox and Tomka 2006:35).
According to records from Governor Almazan to the Viceroy in 1726, “the move involved about
200 people, including missionaries, the officers, soldiers and their families, and four private
citizens” (Fox and Tomka 2006:35, see also Mounger 1959:19). “Shortly afterward, a larger
mission was established about 12.3 km to the north on the west side of the river in what is now
Mission Valley”3 (Fox and Tomka 2006:35). At this new location, missionary efforts toward the
coastal Karankawa were largely abandoned. Instead missionary efforts shifted focus to the more
inland native groups, specifically the Aranama and Tamique (Ricklis 1999a:134, see also Bolton
1906:117; Mounger 1959:53). Also, while located along the Guadalupe, Espíritu Santo would
begin dry-farming as well as raising cattle (Mounger 1959:53).
Escandón’s exploration transpired and his 1746 report to the Viceroy resulted in yet
another move of the mission and presidio (Chipman and Joseph 2010:171, Fox and Tomka
2006:36). In 1749 the official order was given to again relocate Mission Espíritu Santo (Hester
1989:204). This time Espíritu Santo was moved to the San Antonio River4. Situated in this new

location, the road to the Rio Grande could be guarded (Fox and Tomka 2006:36). Again, both
mission and presidio were moved to this last location (Fox and Tomka 2006:36, Ricklis
1999a:133-134). “After the final relocation to the San Antonio River near present Goliad,
Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto de la Bahía became a prominent pivot point of events for over
50 years during the twilight of Spanish Texas” (Fox and Tomka 2006:38).
At this final location, unlike the move from Garcitas Creek to the Guadalupe, the native
populations residing at the mission (largely Aranama), were moved with the mission from its
location along the Guadalupe to its new location along the San Antonio River. As discussed by
Mounger, the Franciscan friars at this final location again attempted to minister to the
Karankawa (1959:30). Apparently the cohabitation of these two native populations was not
feasible and Mission Rosario was created in 1754 specifically designed as a mission for the
Karankawa (Ricklis 1999a:143, Ulrich et al. 2005:3). Though this final location would be
unsuccessful at creating a mission with combined tribes (Aranama and Karankawa), Espíritu
Santo did experience ranching success. At this final location, Mission Espíritu Santo
experienced its economic success and fame as perhaps the largest and most important mission for
ranching cattle (Ramsdell 1949, Mounger 1959:41). Ulrich et al. note that “it was during these
years, the late 1760s, that the mission thrived and boasted the most successful ranching operation
in Texas” (2005:3).
It was previously accepted that Espíritu Santo had three different locations (see Ricklis
1999, Figure 1). The first location was near La Salle’s failed colony at Garcitas Creek, the
second location was the Mission Valley location along the Guadalupe River (41VT11), and the
third location was the Goliad (41GD1) location (Mounger 1959, O’Connor 1966, Ricklis
1999a:134 Figure 1). Undisputed by the literature is the fact that Mission Espíritu Santo de
11

Zúñiga’s original location was indeed along Garcitas Creek, and also that the last, final location
was Goliad (41GD1). However, speculation arose as to the mission’s locations during the
transition period between the initial location and the final location. As presented by Hindes
(1995), and referenced by other archaeologists and literature (Hester et al. 1996:5, Hindes et al.
1999, Walter 2007), it seems likely that there were indeed four actual locations (see Texas
Beyond History 2006). The four locations are as follows: the first location was at Garcitas
Creek, the second location was 41VT10 (known as the Tonkawa Bank Site), the third location
was in Mission Valley (41VT11), and the fourth, final location being Goliad (41GD1).
These relocations however, seem at times confusing in the literature because though the
Mission itself had four locations, the Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto de la Bahía del Espíritu
Santo only had three locations. Apparently when presidio La Bahía was relocated from Garcitas
Creek, it was only moved once, to its location along the Guadalupe River. To further exacerbate
confusion, both the second and third locations (41VT10 and 41VT11 respectively) are located
along the Guadalupe River (Hindes 1995:9). Additionally, as noted by Walter and Hester, the
Tonkawa Bank site “served not only as an intermediate site before the move to Mission Valley,
but most likely continued to function as a visita (or sub-mission) while the third location of the
mission was in operation” (1998:6). Regardless of the specifics, it appears that the Tonkawa
Bank site does indeed have ties to Espíritu Santo. Furthermore, the two interim locations along
the Guadalupe would have ministered the same native populations and do not really affect the
investigations researched in this thesis.
As originally designed, the missions were created to Christianize and convert the local
native populations as well as protect and defend the Spanish lands from foreign invasions. Also
part of the original design was secularization. For the native people living within the mission,
12

secularization ideally meant that they were fully converted into Spanish citizens and no longer
under the guidance and protection of the mission. As such, the natives were expected to be
assimilated into all aspects of Spanish colonial society and were now tax paying Spanish
citizens. For the Spanish, secularization meant the Spanish government was no longer
financially responsible for the missions and could now collect taxes from their newly converted
citizens (Chipman and Joseph 2010:202, Walters 1951). For the Franciscan priests,
secularization meant the mission’s shared property was to be dispersed among the recently
converted natives, and that religious orders and matters became the concern of the Catholic
church (Bolton 1915:12). As noted by Bolton (1915), it was expected that the conversion
process, ultimately ending in secularization, would take ten years. Once these converted natives
became established civilized Spanish citizens, the lands were to be deeded to the Spanish citizens
so they could maintain a livelihood as well as reassure these lands would remain in the name of
Spain and be taxed accordingly (Chipman and Joseph 2010:214; Walter 2007:11). This
secularization of Mission Espíritu Santo would actually transpire several decades after its final
relocation to Goliad.
A host of reasons eventually led to the demise and secularization of Mission Espíritu
Santo. Among some of the larger reasons were that missionization was no longer a defensive
necessity after 1763, economic self-sustainability of the Mission became more difficult, and also
Comanche and Apache raids. The French and Indian War ended in 1763 and the Treaty of Paris
was enacted. During this time period, Spain gained the French Territory of Louisiana (Chipman
and Joseph 2010:174). Because the threat of French invasion was now essentially eliminated
from East and Coastal Texas, there was no longer a need for missionary conversion of
Indigenous populations, as Spain no longer required additional protection by its citizens (Ulrich
13

et al 2005:3). Additionally, as previously mentioned, the 1760’s were a very prosperous decade
for cattle ranching. This ranching success translated in economic success, aiding in sustaining
the Mission. The following decade however marked a downturn in economic success largely
due to a 1778 order regarding unbranded cattle. The January 1778 order stated that all cattle left
unbranded by May 12th of that year would become property of the king (Chipman and Joseph
2010:215, also Ulrich et al. 2005:3). Since large portions of mission cattle herds roamed freely,
not all cattle could possibly be branded, especially within the short four month time frame
(Chipman and Joseph 2010:215). As purported by Ulrich et al., “by the 1780s, the mission’s
holdings were reduced to one-third of what they were in 1760” (2005:3). The depleted cattle
stock, coupled with Apache raids and lack of provisions, resulted in dwindling native
involvement and residence at the Mission (Ulrich et al 2005:3).
A year following the order to secularize Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo), in
1794 the Viceroy Revilla Gigedo II further ordered the secularization all Texas missions that had
been functioning for at least ten years (Chipman and Joseph 2010:214, Walters 1951:287).
Mission Espíritu Santo, as well as neighboring Missions Rosario and Refugio, were exempt from
this decree, as the native populations there were not ready to fully integrate into Spanish life
(Chipman and Joseph 2010:214, O’Connor 1966:71-72).
Political unrest between Spain and Mexico ensued. The year 1821 marked Mexico’s
independence from Spain (O’Connor 1966:79). This further complicated secularization orders as
these missions were established as part of the Spanish empire yet Texas was no longer under the
jurisdiction of Spain (Chipman and Joseph 2010:236). According to O’Conner, secularization
orders were again given on March 28, 1827 (1966:74). However it was not until 1829 that firm,
concrete instruction was given to secularize these coastal missions (1966:74). It was not until
14

1830 that Mission Espíritu Santo was actually secularized (Ramsdell 1949:25, Walters
1951:299). As summarized by Ulrich et al., “the mission struggled along without support though
various raids and sieges until it finally collapsed after 109 years” (2005:4).

CHAPTER THREE: NATIVE GROUPS AT MISSION ESPÍRITU SANTO
Prior to the propagation of the Spanish mission system throughout Northern New Spain,
numerous native groups inhabited the area. Even the earliest Spanish explorers of these lands
noted the people in addition to the landscape. The missions were strategically located, not only
for defensive purposes and access to natural resources, but also to minister to specific local
native groups.
The Aranama, Tamique, and also the Karankawa were the predominant native groups that
Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga ministered to and attempted to convert. As mentioned prior,
the Karankawa were the preliminary focus of missionary efforts at the first location of Mission
Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga along Garcitas Creek. When these natives proved too hostile and the
Mission moved to the Guadalupe River, the missionary efforts shifted focus to the new location’s
native Aranama and Tamique communities (Bolton 1906:117, Goddard 1979:373). As noted by
Ramsdell (1938), there were over four hundred Aranama gathered at this location (Mounger
1959:21). Accompanying the move of Espíritu Santo to its final location along the San Antonio
River was the Mission’s Aranama population (Reed 1938:91).

Mounger further states that

various archived documents mention other coastal native groups as well, most commonly
mentioned were the Tamiques (1959:31, see also Chipman and Joseph 2010:193). In addition to
the Aranama at this final location, efforts were once again undertaken to Christianize and civilize
the Karankawa (Mounger 1959:30, Newcomb 1961:37). Ultimately, in 1754, the Karankawa
population from Espíritu Santo was relocated to Mission Rosario (Himmel 1999:15, Ulrich et al.
2005:3), as Rosario was specifically established to minister to the Karankawa (Bolton 1906:115;
Chipman and Joseph 2010:171, Gilmore 1989:233, Ricklis 1999a:134). Mission Rosario was

16

located within close proximity to Espíritu Santo and remained under the protection of Presidio la
Bahía (Mounger 1959:31).
The Aranama
Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga’s native population was largely Aranama upon its
relocation to the Guadalupe River. It would remain so not only through Espíritu Santo’s move to
the San Antonio River, but also during the remainder of its existence until secularization in 18305
(Mounger 1959:61). Though the native population was predominantly Aranama, Ulrich et al.
purport that in 1758 when the mission was at its final location, “the native population of
Aranama, Tamique, Tawakoni, and Tonkawa groups consisted of 178 women, warriors and
children” (2005:3).
Unfortunately not much is known about the Aranama. Generally speaking, little is known
regarding the native groups during Spanish contact and through the Spanish Colonial era; with
the exception of records from early explorers such as Cabeza de Vaca (see discussion by
Chipman and Joseph 2010:16; Hester 1989:195). Much of what is known about the native
groups of the area derives from Spanish and church documents (Hester 1998:3, 5). Missionary
efforts were focused on conversion of native peoples into proper Catholic Spanish citizens, and
due to the nature of the process, consequently disregarded much of these native peoples’ culture
and heritage. By the very nature of the term conversion, it is not surprising that there was little
apparent concern for preferences of preservation of Indigenous people.
Scant amounts of information exist regarding the Aranama. Even the name Aranama is
problematic in attempting to find documented information on this native group. Since the local
native populations obviously did not speak Spanish, the early explorers and especially the
5

Though the mission remained in operation until 1830 “it declined in population and general significance during the
early decades of the 19th century” (Ricklis 1999a:134).

17

missionaries were left with the task of attempting to phonetically spell various native words,
especially the names of native groups. Perhaps the necessity of this included reasons such as
church and secular documentation, as well as efforts to communicate and teach the natives the
Spanish language and culture. It seems entirely logical that different Spanish individuals (or
even the same person perhaps), translating from a spoken language such as that of the Aranama
into Spanish, could have resulted in a variety of spellings (Campbell 1983:347). Furthermore,
there were numerous populations and therefore various native languages with which the Spanish
had to translate (Campbell 1983:343). Campbell states that, “[p]honetically complex names of
native origin have been rendered by Spanish writers in an astonishing number of ways”
(1988:44). Resultantly, various spelling of the word ‘Aranama’ proliferate the earliest literature
and documentation. Among the seemingly more common spellings are Aranama, Aranames,
Jaranames, Xaranama, and Xaranames (Mounger 1959:61, Chipman and Joseph 2010:193,
Campbell 1997:144, Reed 1938:90, Berlandier 1969:165, Hodge 1907:72).
Though even the spelling of Aranama presents a challenge, small amounts of information
do exist regarding these native people. Though limited, what is known of the Aranama consists
of their general demeanor and disposition, their population location, a minute (and debated)
linguistic remnant, and also neighboring native groups with whom they may have associated
(Mounger 1959:61).
The Aranama are often noted as a more peaceful and friendly group, especially in relation
to the Karankawa. Bolton states that the Aranama and Tamique were “of a different language,
hostile to, and having a somewhat higher civilization than the Karankawa” (1906:117).
Regarding the Aranama upon relocation to the Guadalupe River, Gilmore notes that “the Indians
were easier to deal with” (1989:233). It is possible that the group of Aranama encountered along
18

the Guadalupe, also consisted of other native groups and was not solely Aranama (Mounger
1959:30). The Tamique are often mentioned in correlation with the Aranama and were likely a
sub-group of the Aranama (Walter and Hester 1998:6). Though the Aranama and Tamique were
closely associated (Hodge 1910:682), even less is known about the Tamique than the Aranama
(Walter and Hester 1998:6). It is entirely possible that documented accounts specifically
referencing the Aranama within Espíritu Santo may also include Tamique. Furthermore, the
Aranama and Tamique must have been somewhat agreeable and also tolerant to a degree of
mission life and of the Spanish (and vice versa) considering Espíritu Santo remained ministering
to their population for a substantial length of time.
Like most of the other native groups of the area, the Aranama were largely huntergatherers. As discussed by Walter, “in general, we know that the indigenous people of South
Texas lived in mobile bands of various sizes and that they fished and hunted bison, deer, rabbits,
mice, and other local fauna and seasonally collected pecans and prickly pear fruit” (2007:17).
Evidence thus far indicates that these hunter-gatherers did not rely on agriculture (Ricklis
1999a:136). Typical of hunter-gatherer subsistence was a large reliance on plant foods, but also
dependence on hunting a wide variety of animal foods ranging from bison and deer to mice,
reptiles, and also fishing (Hester 1989:195). According to Spanish records, hunter-gatherers of
the area used bow and arrows, curved sticks possibly for rabbit hunting, and “also used nets,
baskets, and other food collecting gear, and processed plant foods on stone grinding slabs or with
wooden mortars and pestles” (Hester 1989:195). The Aranama are presumed to have been much
like the typical hunter-gatherer groups of the area.
The general location of the Aranama population is said to have occupied the area between
the Guadalupe River and the San Antonio River (Newcomb 1961:31). Campbell and Campbell
19

are a bit more liberal in their geographic dispersion of the Aranama stating they may have ranged
even further east to the lower Colorado River (1985:47). The Aranama lived at the periphery of
a few different native groups. They inhabited a zone of Texas roughly at the margins of
Karankawa, and Tonkawa habitation as well as the Coahuiltecan region (see Mounger
1959:101). Though somewhat oversimplified, roughly speaking, south of the Aranama along the
San Antonio River were the Coahuilteco-speaking groups. To the north of the Aranama was the
Tonkawa population, and to the east along the coast was the Karankawa (Mounger 1959:101).
Though proximity does not necessarily equate cultural affiliation, efforts have been pursued to
determine if a link exists among the Aranama and neighboring native groups.
Some have assumed that the Aranama were Coahuiltecan (Reed 1938:92, Swanton
1952:308, Campbell 1997:145). Coahuiltecan for a time was considered a culture or ethnic
group, but it has since been clarified that the term has been widely misused. Coahuiltecan is
much more a regional description rather than a specific group of native peoples (Hester 1998,
Hester 1989:194, Campbell 1997:145, 297). Although there was a Coahuilteco language at some
earlier point in time, the term Coahuiltecan was used quite generally and liberally to apply to a
great number of hunter gatherer groups of the region. Furthermore, Coahuilteco-speakers should
not be assumed to signify ethnic or cultural affiliation because for many groups, Coahuilteco
may have only been a “second language” (Campbell 1983:348). In the past, the Aranama and
Tamique were referred to as Coahuilteco both in relation and language. More recently however,
Aranama and Tamique are considered to be from an unclassified language group (Campbell
1997:89). Though the Aranama and Tamique spoke the same language (Newcomb 1961:32)
they are discussed as being two different tribes (Goddard 1979:373, Campbell 1997:144).

20

A two word phrase is all that is known of the Aranama language. This phrase was
documented by Dr. Albert S. Gatschet of the Bureau of Ethnology in September 1884 (Hodge
1907:6) and was given by “a Tonkawa man known as Old Simon…in a language Simon
identified as Hanáma or Háname: himiyána ‘water’; himiyána tsáyi! ‘give me water’” (Goddard
1979:372-373). This raises a number of questions when attempting to correlate a cultural
affiliation from this phrase. Swanton purportedly believed that the Aranama phrase above was
clearly relate to Coahuilteco (1915:36), but as Goddard notes, “Swanton’s list of “lexical
resemblances” shows that his criteria of similarity were extremely generous…and it is unlikely
that any specialist today would consider his comparisons to be proof of genetic relationship”
(Goddard 1979:376). Moreover, Hester purports that the Aranama “clearly are not
“Coahuiltecans”” (Hester 1998:5).
Further scrutinizing this linguistic tie, Old Simon was Tonkawa, not Aranama, and also
spoke some Karankawa (Goddard 1979:372). This raises the question of accuracy as the phrase
was given by a non-native speaker. According to Johnson and Campbell, Old Simon learned this
phrase from a tribe living near Matamoros, Tamaulipas, which was where several native Texan
groups had moved (1991:209). Furthermore, though the Aranama identity continued into the
1840s (Hester 1998:5), the Aranama tribe was extinct by 1843(Hodge 1907:72, see also
Berlandier 1969:165). Since this phrase was recorded in 1884, forty-one years after their
purported extinction, the language was most likely also extinct6 since a non-native Aranama
speaker was used as the reference source. Additionally, Old Simon identified this group as
Hanáma or Háname. As noted by Johnson and Campbell, the Hanáma or Háname may possibly
6

Disease and also raids by hostile encroaching groups such as the Apache and Comanche may have been a factor in
diminishing native populations at the time (Campbell 1983:345, Newcomb 1961:37). However, it is also likely that
the Aranama merged into other groups or married into Spanish households and the language dropped from usage
(Campbell 1983:347, Hester 1998:3).

21

be a native group relocated from south of the Rio Grande and therefore the above Aranama
phrase may actually be words from the Hanáma or Háname language (1991:210). Johnson and
Campbell do offer a caveat stating, “Goddard’s speculation that the words are Aranama cannot
be ignored” (Johnson and Campbell 1991:210).
As previously noted, Swanton believes the Aranama were probably Coahuiltecan
(1952:308). Further in his discussion, Swanton then notes that the Mariames encountered by
Cabeza de Vaca were also known as the Muruam, therefore providing a possible Tonkawa
affiliation (Swanton 1952:326, see also Hodge 1907:805). Campbell also acknowledges this
likely connection between the Mariames and Muruam noting that Muruam have been
documented as being located on the Guadalupe River (1988:23). An issue arises in the fact that
some authors have noted that the Mariames ecountered by Cabeza de Vaca are actually the
Aranama. Davenport and Wells state the Mariames mentioned by Cabeza de Vaca were likely
called Jaranames by subsequent explorers (1918:138-139). Castañeda (1936:64) likewise
proposes that the Mariame may also have later been called the Aranama (Mounger 1959:65, see
also Campbell 1988:23). Newcomb also states that the Mariames were “probably the latter-day
Aranamas” (Newcomb 1961:49). If Davenport and Wells (1918), Castañeda (1936), and
Newcomb (1959) are correct in assuming the Mariames are the Aranama, and if Swanton is
correct in noting the Mariames are the Muruam, then logic follows that the Aranama would
actually be the Muruam and therefore Tonkawa. However, Campbell notes that the Mariames
are “not to be confused with the later Aranamas” (1983:351). In his later work, Campbell further
states that this is an incongruous assumption and that the confusion of the Mariames as the
Aranama is due to “presumed similarity in names and in the belief that both groups were

22

associated with the same section of the Guadalupe River east and northeast of San Anotonio”
(1988:23).
Interestingly, if Campbell is correct in stating that the Mariames are not the Aranama, and
if Swanton’s position is correct that the Mariames are the Muruam (inferring Tonkawa
affiliation), then logic follows that the Aranama cannot be the Muruam and therefore the
Aranama cannot be proven to be Tonkawa via this argument. Seeing that the Hanáma or
Háname may not be the Aranama, and that it is doubtful that the Mariames were the Aranama,
and that much of these name relationships may be misnomers, it would be premature to
concretely conclude any type of ethnic or genetic tie at this point in time. As evidenced by these
authors, there is much assumption in trying to decipher native group names, let alone possible
relation and affiliation with neighboring native populations. Location and similarity of name
sound may not be sufficient in establishing the origins of the Aranama. This type of correlation
based on native population location and phonetics should be heeded as a tenuous one.
So to whom then were the Aranama (and likely associated Tamique) related? Since
linguistics cannot provide solid factual evidence, questions of neighboring groups arise. Could
the Aranama be related to their Tonkawa or Karankawa neighbors? As discussed by Mounger,
the Aranama stayed at times with the Tonkawa and Tawakoni when they would desert the
mission (1959:71). It is likely that the Aranama abandoned the mission numerous times as
evidenced through the drastic change in occupancy numbers at Mission Espíritu Santo as
complied by Mounger (1959:69). The Aranama would frequently exit the mission for varying
periods of time, sometimes for months and sometimes for years (Ulrich et al. 2005:3). The
numbers vary greatly and range from 400 persons in 1726, to 116 persons in 1786, to 15 persons
in 1822 (Mounger 1959:69). That the recorded numbers of inhabitants within Espíritu Santo
23

fluctuates through time could be due to the fact that the friars were not entirely successful in
converting the Aranama and Tamique (Mounger 1959:76-77). As further discussed by Mounger,
“when food became plentiful on the outside or peace was made with their enemies, there was
little to keep them in the missions” (1959:95).
It is highly unlikely that the Aranama were related to the Karankawa. Among other
reasons, Mission Rosario was established for the Karankawa of Mission Espíritu Santo because
“it was inadvisable to put them into Mission Espíritu Santo together with the Jaranames and
Tamiques already there, for they were tribes of different languages, of different habits, and
unfriendly” (Bolton 1906:129). Furthermore, Perttula et al. (1995), as well as Ricklis (1999a)
have clearly established that the Karankawa are associated with the Rockport Phase and were a
distinct group from the inland native populations. Evidence for these conclusions is based
largely on ceramics and mobility patterns (Perttula et al 1995, Ricklis 1999a).
A Tonkawa affiliation with the Aranama has also been proposed, however it has come to
light that the Tonkawa are actually not native to the area and derive from Oklahoma (Hester
1989:217, see also Newcomb 1993:26-27). The Tonkawa presence in this region of Texas did
not occur until sometime in the beginning of the seventeenth century (Hester 1989:217,
Newcomb 1993:26-27, Tomka 2010:98). This information does not negate the possibility of
some common genetic relation between the Tonkawa and the Aranama, however as will be
discussed later, this Oklahoma derivation of the Tonkawa possibly complicates the issue of the
origins of Goliad ceramics unearthed at Mission Espíritu Santo.

24

CHAPTER FOUR: NATIVE CERAMICS
Goliad ware
Profuse amounts of native ceramic sherds have been discovered during archaeological
excavations at Mission Espíritu Santo de Zuñíga. Though other types of ceramic wares have also
been discovered at Espíritu Santo, native ceramics by far are the majority of the ceramic
assemblage. As defined by Mounger, the native ceramics associated with Espíritu Santo are
known as Goliad ware (1959:163-177). Goliad ware (also sometimes referred to simply as
Goliad) has also been found at other Spanish colonial sites, including the Mission Valley
location of Espríritu Santo (Perttula 2002:256) as well as Presidio La Bahia, San Antonio
mission sites, and Rancho de las Cabras (Ricklis 1999a:19). Though found in numerous Spanish
colonial contexts, the name Goliad ware derives from the final location of Mission Espíritu Santo
de Zuñíga (41GD1) near current day Goliad, Texas which was the focus of Mounger’s 1959
thesis.
Goliad ware, a native made ceramic, is found in various Texas Spanish colonial contexts
yet is unique from Mexican majolica, the various colonial wares, and Chinese porcelain (Walter
2007:85). Additionally, Goliad ware is distinguishably different from other known specific
native wares sometimes found in Mission contexts, such as Rockport ware or Caddoan vessels.
Goliad ware is generally described as a native produced utilitarian ware (Ricklis 1999a:165) that
is unglazed (Walter 2007:85). Goliad ware has been described as a “gray ware fired on openfires rather than kilns and containing moderate to abundant bone temper. Paste color ranges
from various shades of gray, to yellowish-brown, and red, in part conditioned by firing
conditions, the type of clay used, and the presence/absence of slips” (Tomka 2010:96). This
description is representative of the common definition of Goliad ware. Fox similarly describes
25

Goliad ware as “hand-built and bone tempered. The color of the surfaces of the sherds varies
from grayish tan to red-orange, while the color of the interior is gray to black, indicating that the
vessels were fired in the uncontrolled environment of an open fire” (2005:37).
Most descriptions of Goliad ceramics mention all or in part that the pottery was hand
built, that it was bone tempered, that it was open fired (Fox 2005:37, Mounger 1959, Ricklis
1999a:139-140, 1999b:19-25, Tomka 2010). These handmade ceramics were created using local
clays which were then tempered and rolled into ropes. Coiling was then employed where the
clay ropes were coiled on top of each other until the desired height was achieved. The coils were
then smoothed together to create the vessel walls. “The use of bone as a tempering agent… is
most prevalent in the ceramic traditions linked to central and south Texas” (Walter et al.
2004:393). Bone temper in Goliad ceramic sherds is usually quite visible to the naked eye.
Most Goliad ware contains moderate to profuse amounts of bone temper visible not just in crosssection but sometimes from the interior or exterior vessel wall, evidenced in the sherds as white
specks. Additionally kilns were not used to fire these ceramics and they were low-fired in an
open fire. As a result of using an open fire, the atmosphere cannot be controlled as with a kiln
and therefore the ceramics could have been fired in varying degrees of oxidizing or reducing
atmospheres. As this ware was a utilitarian ware, vessels types were largely plain bowls, jars,
and ollas (Ricklis 1999a:139, Mounger 1959, Walter 2007:86-87).
Goliad ware has essentially become the name assigned to native wares associated with
the San Antonio and Texas Coastal missions that are not designated as another specific type such
as Rockport ware or Caddoan pottery. Goliad ware has a widespread distribution across the
mission time period and is present to some degree at all the San Antonio missions and some
coastal missions as well. This is evidenced in numerous site reports for the San Antonio
26

missions (Eaton 1980, Figueroa and Tomka 2009, Hard 1995, Ulrich 2004, Fox 1981, Fox and
Houk 1998), and also the coastal missions (Ulrich et al. 2005, Nickels 2000, Tennis 2002).
Goliad ware has become a rather general categorization for these mission period native
ceramics. As noted above, Goliad ware is found at various locations, including presidios (e.g.
Fox and Tomka 2006) and these locations have been correlated with a number of different native
groups. Furthermore, these various locations would have had access to different local clays. It
seems that some degree of variation within the Goliad type would be expected (Ulrich et al.
2005:41). “Yet, to date, very little careful characterization of Goliad ceramics has been
conducted to determine the degree of variability within this broadly inclusive type (cf. Perttula
2002; Ricklis 1999, 2000)” (Ulrich et al. 2005: 41).
Mounger identified three different types of Goliad ware upon examining the collection of
approximately 22,000 sherds from the final location (along the San Antonio River) of Mission
Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga (1959:163). These three types are known as Goliad Plain, Goliad Redon-buff, and Goliad Black-on-buff (Mounger 1959:164-169). Goliad Plain is essentially the
general Goliad type as described above and lacks decorative elements. Some vessels do however
have handles (Monger 1959:165). Both Goliad Black-on-buff and Goliad Red-on-Buff are
essentially identical to Goliad Plain, with the exception that they contain decorative elements and
that vessel walls for these decorative types are slightly thinner7 (Mounger 1959:164-169,
Campbell 1962:334). Goliad Black-on-buff is decorated with black asphaltum painted in designs
that include “bands at the lip, zig-zag lines, semi-circular loops, dots, and uneven dabs”
(Mounger 1959:169). Goliad Red-on-buff is decorated with red ochre painted in designs that

As noted by Mounger, Goliad Plain vessel wall thickness ranged from 5-13mm and the wall thickness for both the
Red -on-buff and Black-on-buff only ranged from 4-6mm (1959:165, 167,168). Since the proportion of decorated
ceramics is small, the suggestion that decorative types have thinner walls may simply be due to vagaries of
sampling. These decorative Goliad types having thinner walls than Goliad Plain may possibly suggest some
influence from the generally thinner walled Rockport wares as well.

include “bands at the lip, zig-zag lines, and semi-circular loops” (Mounger 1959:168). Campbell
additionally notes that some of the design motifs on the Goliad Red-on-buff and also the Goliad
Black-on-buff, either resemble or are almost identical, respectively, to that of Rockport Blackon-gray vessels (1962:334, Tomka 2010:97).
Though three types exist, Goliad Plain is the most common and abundant type of Goliad
ware “in most collections from the inland coastal plains and San Antonio missions” (Tomka
2010:97). In the assemblage utilized by Mounger in her thesis, of the 22,000 sherds examined,
21,612 were categorized as Goliad Plain (1959:164). That translates to just a bit over ninetyeight percent (98%) of the total sherds were Goliad Plain. Goliad Plain being the predominant
type of Goliad ware is further supported by Ricklis as he similarly noted in his own investigation
that only 5 out of 2,792 sherds from Mission Espíritu Santo had asphaltum decoration
(1999a:140).
Goliad ware and Leon Plain
Interestingly, Goliad ware is essentially defined by the mission contexts in which it is
found (Walter 2007:87). As noted by Mounger, “Goliad types of pottery represent mission-made
ware” (1959:258). “Goliad ware closely resembles the Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric bonetempered plainware of the Toyah horizon, and it is virtually certain that it represents an early
historic continuity in an inland coastal prairie ceramic tradition that was rooted in the Late
Prehistoric period” (Ricklis 1999a:140). This bone-tempered pottery to which Ricklis
(1999a:140) refers is known as Leon Plain (Black 1982, 1986a:389-390, Suhm et al. 1954,
Hester and Hill 1971). Leon Plain ceramics have been associated with the Toyah horizon; a
period in time from about A.D. 1250 to the beginning of the Mission period (Hester 2003, xii).
The Toyah horizon (discussed extensively by Black 1982, 1986a, Johnson 1994, and Kenmotsu
28

and Boyd 2012) is widespread throughout the central part of Texas and is marked by a collection
of material culture traits often referred to as the Toyah toolkit. Geographically, the Toyah
horizon includes the Edwards Plateau, the Llano Uplift, and also parts of neighboring areas of
“the Rolling Plains, Oak Woods and Prairies, Blackland Prairie, Gulf Coast Prairies and
Marshes, and South Texas Brush Country” (Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012:2). Some of the material
culture traits of this toolkit are Perdiz arrow points (and also Fresno, Harrel, and Garaz points),
end scrapers, perforators, two- and four- beveled knives, and simple bone tempered clay pottery
(Hester 2003:xii, Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012:10). This simple bone tempered clay pottery, also
referred to as Leon Plain or Doss Redware (Boyd 2012:129), was not manufactured in central
Texas before the Toyah phase (Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012:10). These material-culture traits of
the Toyah horizon likely “diffused during a time when bison-hunting was an important activity
among many hunters and gatherers”8 (Hester 2003:xii). Black concludes that Goliad ware is a
continuation of Leon Plain when he states, “a single ceramic tradition is represented by the Late
Prehistoric and mission period (early Historic) bone-tempered pottery in south and central
Texas” (1986a:391).
Distinction then between Leon Plain and Goliad ware is demarcated by the Spanish
mission presence as the two wares are “technologically comparable” (Perttula 2002:254-255).
As echoed by Walter, Goliad ware is the apparent continuation of Leon Plain, as the technology
of these two wares is the same, the only difference in these ceramics being the name (2007:87).
Leon Plain ceramics do however tend to be basic bowl, jar, and olla vessels, while Goliad ware
exhibits some Spanish influence in that “other vessel forms include candleholders, spoons,

8

Though the Toyah toolkit is often equated with Bison hunting and processing, the presence of Bison herds likely
fluctuated (Hester 2004:147, Mauldin et al. 2012). Other animals and plants would also have been of dietary
importance.

29

footed vessels, pottery rests, as well as whistles, and it is probable that these forms were made
specifically for use by the Spanish missionaries and colonists” (Perttula 2002:255, see also
Mounger 1959:173-177). “The ceramic evidence from Mission Espiritu Santo at Goliad does
indicate that new ceramic forms were made with a traditional technology, employing the same
paste, temper, and production used to produce aboriginal bowls, jars, bottles, and Ollas” (Tennis
2002:259).
Hester feels strongly that these two ceramic traditions are inextricably linked when he
states “…it is specifically the bone-tempered pottery tradition of Late Prehistoric times that
becomes the dominant utility ware of the missions and that persists in southern Texas into the
early nineteenth century” (Hester 1989:216). Johnson likewise notes that within most of the
Franciscan missions, Classic Toyah ceramic vessels were still being manufactured (1994:280).
Though there is a high probability that Leon Plain and Goliad ware are indeed related, Tomka
calls attention to the fact that “no direct evidence exists linking the manufacturers of Leon Plain
wares to the Colonial or Mission period” (2010:97).
Leon Plain
Toyah phase ceramics, also known as Leon Plain, are typically referred to as utilitarian
vessel that are small and plain (Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012:12). According to Hester (1980),
more than one-hundred sites in South Texas have been associated with this type of pottery
(Black 1986a:339). This Toyah pottery was created by coiling (Black 1986a:339). Ropes of
clay were attached upon each other to gain vessel body size and height. Each clay rope was
pressed “down on the vessel’s inside surface while pressing and pulling up on the pot’s exterior”
(Johnson 1994:205). The ropes were then smoothed together, though degree of smoothing
among these vessels can differ (Johnson 1994:205). The local clay used by the Toyah potters
30

was tempered with varying amounts of ground or crushed bone, and the surface and core of the
vessels dried at approximately the same rate, avoiding cracking and splitting. The vessels were
then open fired (Black 1986a:339, Boyd 2012, Johnson 1994:205-207). Most common among
the vessel shapes are somewhat larger bowls that are nearly hemispherical, smaller deep bowls
that had an incurving rim and rounded sides, ollas with a mouth that was constricted to some
degree, and simple long jars (Johnson 1994:274, Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012:12, Ricklis
1992:261). This bone tempered pottery is typically undecorated, though infrequently occurring
is “incising, punctates, brushing, and asphaltum decoration” (Black 1986a:339). Though Toyah
pottery is often described as crudely made, there are instances where highly burnished well-made
Toyah pottery has been found (Boyd 2012:129).
The Toyah people likely used these vessels for reasons such as water storage and also
cooking and eating plants (Johnson 1994:188). Jars would have been used to render fat by
simmering bone fragments, likely buffalo and other game such as deer and antelope (Boyd
2012:130, Johnson 1994:288, Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012:12, Ricklis 1994:300). A fairly limited
range of Toyah vessel functions have been inferred which includes water storage, cooking, food
storage, and smoking (Black 1982, 1986a, 1986b). These Toyah potters were mobile hunter
gatherers within limited ranges. They often moved from one camp to another, resulting in
constant numerous chores and responsibilities, leaving little time to be spent on creating these
vessels to be “great works of engineering and art” (Johnson 1994:188).
A summary of four Toyah ceramic findings can be found in Tables 1-4. For the most
part, limited analyses have been conducted regarding Toyah ceramics and these analyses can
vary in attributes recorded. This limited information is largely due to ceramic assemblage size,
condition of the sherds, and also the size of the sherds themselves. The first study, by LeRoy
31

Johnson (1994) is from the Buckhollow Encampment (41KM16) in Kimble County, Texas (see
Table 1). The next is by Stephen L. Black and Joachim McGraw (1985) regarding the Panther
Springs Creek Site (41BX228), Bexar County, Texas (see Table 2). The last two are from
different prehistoric sites in the basin of Choke Canyon Reservoir located in the neighboring
Texas counties of McMullen and Live Oak. The Phase I (Table 3) and Phase II (Table 4)
ceramic findings of these investigations are both reported by Stephen L. Black (1982, 1986a).

Likely Aranama Correlation
In Mounger’s thesis she credited Goliad ware production to the Aranama (1959:179-180,
262). This conclusion was reached perhaps first and foremost by the fact that copious amounts
of Goliad ware were unearthed at Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñgia where the native population
was predominantly Aranama. Secondly, as quoted by Mounger, in 1854 John Linn who was an
early settler in the area described the Aranama women as having “manufactured cloth, and also
water-jars used by themselves” (1959:94). Linn’s (1854) quote above, is further supported by
Ricklis (though not referenced by Mounger ) when Fr. Mariano Cardenas in 1782 stated that the
Aranama women “are almost always busy making ollas, bowls and other things of clay, for
which they have great skill” (Ricklis 1999b:20). Though both the recorded statements by Linn
(1935) and Cardenas (Ricklis 1999b:20) clearly describe the Aranama making pottery, these
statements are insufficient at determining whether the Aranama brought their own pottery
tradition into the mission, or whether they may have been taught this pottery skill at the mission.
O’Connor purports that the Aranama women, in addition to being “taught to spin and
weave” also “became quite proficient in making wool blankets and clay pottery” (1966:26).
Though O’Connor’s (1966) statement “seems to suggest that the Aranama learned to make
pottery from the Spanish” (Tomka 2010:97), no source is cited by O’Connor for these
statements. This again creates further ambiguity as to whether O’Connor (1966) assumed the
Aranama were taught to make pottery or whether she actually found specific reference to the
Aranama creating pottery. Furthermore, by asserting that “The latter [squaws] became quite
proficient in making wool blankets and clay pottery”, O’Connor (1966:26) does not directly state
that the Aranama were actually taught to make pottery, only that they became proficient at this
skill. Since the Aranama would likely have made a greater quantity and variety of ceramics in a
36

more sedentary and agriculturally dependent mission setting than they would have as mobile
hunter gatherers, becoming proficient in making pottery may be an effect of missionization, but
does not necessarily infer a taught skill. Proficiency may simply mean the Aranama were able to
hone their ceramic skills and abilities that they already had prior to entering the mission.
Knowing that the Karankawa were also present at Mission Espíritu Santo would seem to
confuse the origin of Goliad ceramics, however much research has determined that the
Karankawa were associated with Rockport ceramics (Perttula et al. 1995, Ricklis 1999). This
ware is much different from Goliad as it is sandy paste with little or no bone temper, and often
has asphaltum decoration. (Perttula et al. 1995, Ricklis 1999). Since Goliad ware is definitely a
divergent practice from Rockport ware (which as noted above are attributed to Karankawa
production), and that the only other substantial native presence at Mission Espíritu Santo were
the Aranama, manufacture of Goliad ceramics is thus attributed to the Aranama.
Some problems arise in the correlation of Goliad ware to the Aranama, specifically in
reference to Aranama genetic affiliation. Tonkawa relation would infer that the Aranama are not
native to Central Texas as the Tonkawa derive from Oklahoma and did not arrive in Texas until
early in the seventeenth century (Newcomb 1993:26-27, Hester 1989:217). Because of this, “it
is unlikely that they [the Tonkawa] were responsible for the distinctive Toyah horizon cultural
pattern” (Hester 1989:217). As discussed above, it is quite probable that Goliad ware is the
“historic period version of Leon Plain” (Tomka 2010:96). If the Aranama are related to the
Tonkawa and “were responsible for the bone-tempered pottery made at Espíritu Santo, they
could not have been the manufacturers of the prehistoric Leon Plain antecedents of the ware”
(Tomka 2010:98); essentially the Tonkawa linkage to Leon Plain would not be plausible (Hester
1989:224). Therefore if the Aranama are the originators of Goliad ware and correlated Leon
37

Plain, then the Aranama cannot be Tonkawa. However if the Aranama are not related to the
Tonkawa, then the Aranama could possibly be the originators of Goliad ware and correlated
Leon Plain. Alternatively, if the Aranama are Tonkawa, then perhaps the Aranama were taught
to make Goliad ware at Espíritu Santo. It seems highly unlikely that Goliad ware is not the
continuation of Leon Plain. Therefore, the Aranama would have to have prehistoric ties to this
general area of Texas if they were responsible for Goliad ware.
So if the Aranama were responsible for Goliad wares, then how is the occurrence of these
ceramics explained at other area Spanish missions? Regarding the native women at Espíritu
Santo, Fr. Mariano Cardenas noted that they “are the ones most dedicated to work and are almost
always busy making ollas, bowls and other things of clay, for which they have great skill and
which they trade with the Spaniards of the Presidio La Bahía (Cardenas 1782, author’s
translation)” (Ricklis 1999b:20). If Goliad ware was being produced not only for use at Espíritu
Santo but also for trade, this could explain the appearance of Goliad wares at other area missions
as well. Tomka notes that “given the small number of Aranama residents in the San Antonio
missions, one would have to assume that the Spanish used the Aranama residing at…Espíritu
Santo…to furnish ceramics for all other South Texas and coastal mission under Spanish
jurisdiction” (Tomka 2010:98). Anne Fox has also suggested to Hester (1989:224) that Goliad
ware was so common in the missions of the area largely due to necessity. Anne purported that
the mission may have experienced a shortage of ceramics and there was a need for local made
pottery (Hester 1989:224). This information, when taken all together seems to infer that a lack
of much needed pottery (and likely other items) led to a need for local made ceramics and that
the Aranama who were the majority of the population associated with Mission Espíritu Santo de
Zúñiga, were likely manufacturers of this locally produced Goliad ware.
38

Though the Aranama were likely producers of Goliad ware within Mission Espíritu
Santo, it is entirely possible that the correlation with this ceramic type extends beyond that of the
Aranama. As previously noted, Goliad ware has been found in numerous colonial-period sites
such as Mission Espíritu Santo at Goliad (41GD1), Mission Espíritu Santo along the Guadalulpe
River (41VT11), the San Antonio mission sites, as well as Rancho de las Cabras (41WN30)
(Ricklis 1999a:19, Black 1982a:452). However the Aranama are only recorded in small numbers
within the San Antonio missions (Tomka 2010: 98). The correlated Leon Plain ware associated
with the Toyah horizon is likewise ubiquitous across the area and has been associated with over
one-hundred sites in South Texas (Black 1982:440, 452, Black 1986a:339). Since numerous
hunter gatherer groups were associated with this region of Texas prior to Spanish presence, and
material cultural evidence indicates these Toyah people created and used Leon Plain pottery
(Johnson 1994), it is quite perceivable that both Leon Plain ware and Goliad ware correlate with
a geographic distribution more so than an ethnic one. The widespread distribution of Leon Plain
and Goliad wares does not coincide with the much smaller geographic distribution of the
Aranama. Discussions surrounding these issues include the possibility that the Aranama created
Goliad ware within Espírirtu Santo for distribution across the local areas under Spanish
jurisdiction (Tomka 2010:98) and also the possibility that Indigenous populations associated
with Leon Plain ceramics were declining. Since the numbers of Toyah people surviving until the
mission period is unknown, it possible that the Aranama were just one of few surviving groups
able to continue this pottery tradition (Johnson 1994:281). However, given the overlap in
distribution and the similarity of these wares, the assumption that Goliad ware is the historic
continuation of prehistoric Leon Plain pottery seems supported.

CHAPTER FIVE: EVOLUTIONARY THOUGHT IN ANTHROPOLOGY
Evolutionary thinking in anthropology can be traced back to the nineteenth century, with
strong ties to sociology. Histories of these developments have been discussed in some length by
authors such as McGee and Warms (2008:5-68, 226-405) and Johnson (1999:132-148). Many
discussions of evolution seem to begin with Charles Darwin, yet before Darwin published his On
the Origins of Species by Means of Natural Selection in 1859, Herbert Spencer’s thoughts on
cultural evolution were already influencing the anthropological thinking and works of Lewis
Henry Morgan and Sir Edward Burnett Tylor. Much of this thought was based on the concept of
unilineal evolution, essentially a progressive evolution of culture from simple to complex. This
notion of unilineal evolution took various guises including the progression of humans from
savage to civilized (McGee and Warms 2008:8-10).
Drawing from the works of Spencer, Morgan, and Tylor, anthropological works by Leslie
White and Julian Steward marked a pivotal point in the history of evolutionary thinking. This
“re-emergence of evolutionary thought” began in the late 1940s and 1950s (McGee and Warms
2008:226) following the Boasian period of anthropology’s focus on historical particularism,
which for the most part, rejected evolutionary thinking (Leonard 1993:34). Though White
brought back the utility of an evolutionary perspective, Steward in particular made a
transformative contribution to evolutionary thought by proposing his theory of mulitlinear
evolution. As opposed to unilineal evolution, multilinear evolution suggested multiple possible
evolutionary courses for culture, not just a simple linear progression (McGee and Warms
2008:227). Though approaches by both White and Steward still had strong ties to the
sociocultural concepts of their predecessors, further anthropological works were beginning to

40

employ notions of evolution that quietly echoed aspects of Darwin’s evolution (Johnson
1999:134-138).
A shift away from the more static, typological culture history school was ushered into
archaeology via Lewis Binford’s (1962) call for a more scientific approach to archaeology.
Binford’s (1962, 1968) ‘New Archaeology’ would come to be known as processualism, which
introduced a need for a more dynamic approach to anthropological studies. This more dynamic
approach included incorporating process and systems thinking. Though an evolutionary focus
was embedded in what Binford (1962, 1965) proposed, Dunnell (1978, 1980) discussed how
previous paradigms including culture history and processualism actually lacked a focus or
applicability of evolutionary thinking despite their espoused positions (Leonard 2001:66).
Evolutionary Archaeology
Contributions to studies of evolution, such as those of Lewontin’s (1970, 1974) aided in
ushering in a renewed interested in evolutionary perspectives in archaeology (see Dunnell 1980).
The inception of evolutionary archaeology dates to the late 1970s and early 1980s when Rindos
essentially called attention to the fact that humans should be viewed as no different from any
other living organism and therefore subject to biological evolution (Leonard 2001). Dunnell’s
paper on style and function (1978) called for a more evolutionary approach to archaeology.
Dunnell (1978) outlined Darwinian principles as a means for incorporating a more scientific and
biological evolution into archaeological theory – hence Evolutionary Archaeology. Dunnell
(1978) specifically called attention to the utility of employing processes such as natural selection
as an important explanatory mechanism. Furthermore, Dunnell (1978) differentiated style and
function as separate processes where style is understood as a stochastic process and function as
an evolutionary process.
41

Early applications of applying Darwinian evolutionary theory to anthropology are rather
limited to the works of Rindos (1980, 1984) (Dunnell 1989:36). Among many others (including
Dunnell 1980, 1989), works by archaeologists such as Leonard (1993, 2001), Leonard and Jones
(1987), and Neff (1992) began further advancing and developing these studies. Continuing
along this idea of incorporating Darwin’s biological evolutionary notion of natural selection into
archaeological theory, a number of edited works have been published further elaborating upon
and discussing these tenets of Evolutionary Archaeology (see Hurt and Rakita 2001, O’Brien and
Lyman 2000, Teltser 1995, Cochrane and Gardner 2011).
Though Dunnell’s 1978 paper was succeeded by a number of works he published in the
1980s and 1990s (see O’Brien and Lyman 2000:416-417), his early works discuss the
fundamentals of the theoretical application. According to Dunnell, evolutionary archaeology
should provide an explanatory framework. This framework ideally “accounts for the structure
and change evident in the archaeological record in terms of evolutionary processes (natural
selection, flow, mutation, drift) either identical to or analogous with these processes as specified
in neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory” (1978:197).
The Darwinian biological principles of variation, inheritance, and selection are the main
focus of evolutionary archaeology. Some authors prefer alternate terminology for inheritance
and selection and synonymously employ the terms transmission and replicative success,
respectively. However of primary importance in evolutionary archaeology is an emphasis on
selection; hence the sometimes alternatively employed pseudonyms of selectionism or
selectionist theory for evolutionary archaeology (cf. Dunnell 2001:xix). Overall, the focus of
evolutionary archaeology is on examining the functional characteristics of artifacts or material
culture and their differential persistence through time.
42

In terms of biological evolution, a number of variations exist both genotypically and
phenotypically, where phenotype is the physical expression of the genes/genotype. A very basic
rendering of this concept is that variations exist among organisms and correspondingly their
genes. Transmission of variation occurs as these genes can be inherited, or passed on via
reproduction. Over time these inherited genes are selected for (or not selected), and typically
viewed as advantageous. The differential persistence of genetic variation (aka natural selection)
over time, leads to adaptations to the environment (Leonard 2001:68). Applying these concepts
to archaeology requires that the concept of phenotype be extended to encompass artifacts,
material culture, and behaviors that produce that material culture (Dunnell 1978, 1980, Leonard
1993:36, 2001:68, Leonard and Jones 1987, O’Brien et al. 1994:261). In discussion of
phenotypic extension, O’Brien et al. (1994) note that when a spider spins a web or a beaver
builds a damn, behavioral genetics accepts these as phenotypic traits. Similarly then, O’Brien et
al. claim that a mud-dauber’s nest is no different than daub for a Mississippian house (1994:269).
Furthermore, they note that the manufacture and utilization of pots are also “encoded within the
genotype” (O’Brien et al. 1994:269) and therefore subject to evolutionary processes. Essentially
the argument here is that human culture as evidenced in the material record including the
behaviors that produced this material culture, are no different than a spider’s web, a beaver’s
dam, or a bird’s nest an likewise subject to the tenets of evolution.
Referring back to Dunnell’s (1978) work on style and function, some applications of
evolutionary archaeology ascribe to the notion that style is seen as a neutral trait and therefore
not a result of selection, nor subject to evolution. Ramenofsky notes that some variants are
“neutral with respect to fitness” and as a result cease to exist or “vary stochastically though time”
(1995:141). Ramenofsky (1995) further describes evolution as pertaining to archaeology as a
43

two-step process (see also Neff 1992) where the first step is variation, essentially style. The
second step is the functional aspect that can be inherited and selected with a differential selective
value, and therefore subject to evolution. This in turns means that style is subject to stochastic
processes such as the concepts of drift and mutation. In archaeological terms these concepts of
drift and mutation essentially equate to random transmission of traits (e.g. pottery decoration)
and innovation, respectively. Functional traits however (e.g. ceramic temper type or vessel wall
thickness), establish the evolutionary and processual aspect upon which selection may act over
time. Though the focus of evolutionary archaeology is on functional and not stylistic attributes
of artifacts, whether an attribute is functional and affects fitness is historically contingent on its
environment (Teltser 1995:7). This point is somewhat clarified when Dunnell states that “calling
something stylistic or functional is not an inference but a hypothesis in need of testing, always”
(2001:xx).
So how then is evolutionary theory actually applied to the study of material culture?
Obviously material culture cannot breed and reproduce, however the people responsible for this
material culture most certainly can. Furthermore, it may indeed be the case that the creation and
use of pottery helped sustain the people creating and using it, allowing them survive and
reproduce and passing along this technology from generation to generation. As noted by Neff,
“frequency changes in cultural traits occur because of differentials in cultural reproductive
success, not because of differentials in biological reproductive success” (2001:427).
Variation of pottery arises by various means over time. Mechanism for the propagation
of variation could include diffusion of ideas, copying from contact with other cultures and people
(or copying errors even), independent creative innovation (human intent), and even accidental
creation or errors (mutation) (Neff 1992:144-147). Some of this generated variation may be
44

stylistic, while others may be functional. It is also possible for a ceramic attribute such as slip to
be seen as functional in nature, however the color of the slip itself may be stylistic (Dunnell
2001:xx). Ramenofsky (1995) echoes Dunnell (2001) in noting that some artifacts traits of
negative selective value can be coupled with a selected trait and therefore persist though time.
Careful evaluation is required in determining whether a trait is considered functional or not, and
this may differ though time varying on historical circumstance and environment (see also
VanPool 2001).
It is important to keep in mind that variation occurs quite independent of transmission
and selection. Generally speaking, transmission of the knowledge of pottery making “tends to
flow along lines of genetic relatedness in small-scale, kin-based societies (Neff 1992:150). As
noted by Rindos (1984), Darwin formulated his notion of evolution via natural selection without
knowing the exact process of Gregor Mendel’s work on genetics. It is not that the means of
transmission or selection is unimportant, simply that comprehending the exact mechanisms of
transmission are not necessary in formulation of this theory (Neff 1992:150). What is important
is that transmission does occur. Evolutionary archaeology theory is not invalidated simply
because the theory does not dictate means of transmission of information or selection.
Ultimately, evolutionary archeology theory is concerned with the differential persistence of traits
as often evidenced through artifact frequencies (Teltser 1995:4-6, Jones et al. 1995:28). As
espoused by evolutionary archaeology, evolution is “the differential persistence of variation
though time, through transmission and selection” (Bentley 2011:96).
Benefits of an evolutionary archaeology approach include a rather concise theoretical
perspective to which one can adhere since Darwinian biological principles are analogous to the
principles of evolutionary archaeology. Since archaeologists often only have the material
45

evidence in the archaeological record available for examination, this perspective fits accordingly
in that all the information needed to apply evolutionary archaeological theory is in the artifacts
themselves. Evolutionary archaeology offers a way to combine the historical aspect of culture
with the trajectory of the evolution of culture via style and function.
Some authors have noted disadvantages with employing evolutionary archaeology theory
(e.g. Boone and Smith 1998, Gabora 2006, Lonely 2000, Schiffer 1996). One large point of
contention is a lack of uniformity in terminology use which seems to generate much confusion.
Terminology is often conflated and further exacerbating confusion is that most archaeologists are
not geneticists, nor biologists. Another point of contention with evolutionary archaeology is that
modes of transmission are largely ignored9. However as noted above, for selection to occur, the
mode or modes of transmission need not be completely understood. Additionally by nature of
the concept, evolution requires time and therefore application of an evolutionary archaeology
perspective requires a temporal component adequate to evidence changes in frequency of
artifacts or attributes of artifacts. Behavioral ecology proponents most often draw attention to
this fact, as behavioral ecological models operate on a relatively shorter term. Behavioral
ecologists also tend to note that employing an evolutionary archaeological perspective fails to
account for human agency and intent. Evolutionary archaeology however, views human agency
as just another means of variation. Simply because a human intends to create a different type of
pottery, or because a human intends to incorporate a different temper type into their pottery, does
not mean this pottery will be selected for over time. Human agency, in this perspective, is
viewed as another generator of variation.

9

Dual inheritance theorists address modes of cultural transmission (e.g. Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1981, Boyd
and Richerson 1985).

Evolutionary Archaeology and Pottery
Evolutionary archaeology has been applied to a variety of non-ceramic studies. Leonard
and Reed (1993) in their examination of population aggregation as related to specialized
production and Maxwell (1995) in his discussion of rock mulching as a farming technique and
methods for determining and identifying natural selection and adaption, are but two of numerous
applications that do not pertain to ceramics. As mentioned previously, evolutionary archaeology
theory is well suited for examining material culture, including behaviors that resulted in material
culture as evidenced in the archaeological record. Accordingly so, pottery is also well suited for
evolutionary archaeological studies. Not only was pottery made to last and therefore well
evidenced in the archaeological record - even if only as sherds (Braun 1983:108), many
publications exist regarding methods of ceramic manufacture which can aid in inferring
functional characteristics and performance attributes of ceramics (e.g. Rice 1987, Rye 1981,
Shepard 1980). Examples of employing an evolutionary archaeology perspective to ceramic
studies are likewise numerous. Braun (1983, 1987), Neff (1995), Nieman (1995), and O’Brien et
al. (1994) are merely a handful of such examples.
In applying evolutionary archaeology to ceramics, it is necessary to consider attributes
that are typically considered functional. These attributes may include, but are not limited to, wall
thickness, orifice diameter, temper type, temper density, rim profile, and lip treatment. These
attributes in turn structure the types of questions to ask when employing this evolutionary
perspective. For example, O’Brien et al. state that “we might speak in shorthand notation of
shell-tempered pottery replacing sand-tempered pots, but what we are interested in from an
evolutionary perspective is the changing frequencies of tempering agents (analogous to alleles)
through time (1994:203). In this example, temper would be a functional attribute where an
47

examination of the temper change over time may be analyzed to determine if temper was
possibly subject to selection. This is because temper type can affect performance attributes of
pottery such as crack initiation and propagation (Braun 1983:123). Furthermore, forming the
question from an evolutionary perspective then aids in discussing the adaptive value of shell
tempered pottery. This is because “functional traits of artifacts such as projectile points or
ceramics must impact the ability of individuals using these artifacts to accomplish selectively
important tasks” (VanPool 2001:121).
In this thesis, a number of attributes were measured from Goliad ware rim sherds from
Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga. These functional attributes include measurements of rim
thickenss, rim diameter, rim profile, lip treatment and vessel form. All of these attributes can be
discussed in terms of function as related to performance characteristics. In other words, each of
these attributes can be altered in the forming and manufacturing processes to change the way the
vessel might be used by people and also the way it behaves during the ceramic forming and
manufacturing process. Additionally important, these attributes also affect the end results of the
created ceramics as they are subject to different usage stresses.
On a larger scale, examining functional characteristics that may have been selected for
over time allows for evaluation based in a specific historical setting. In this thesis, it has already
been established that the Aranama, the likely creators of Goliad ware, were a hunter-gatherer
group prior to Spanish missionization. Historical accounts have detailed how the Aranama
resided within the Mission Espíritu Santo compound for varying lengths of time. Essentially, the
Aranama became increasingly sedentary upon Spanish influence from establishing their
missions, specifically here, Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñgia. Aligned with increasing
sedentism is a change in subsistence practices. Though some reliance on hunting and gathering
48

was still evident during the time the Aranama were associated with the mission, the Spanish
introduced cattle ranching and raising of other livestock (sheep, goats, horses, etc.), as well as a
reliance on agricultural crops such as corn and various fruits (Mounger 1959:33-34). This
change in subsistence and sedentism may have resulted in selective pressures evidenced in the
pottery that was created and used. This evidence could be in terms of not only ceramic types, but
also in terms of how it was manufactured as well as in how it was used. Furthermore, since
Goliad ware of the mission period is seen largely as a continuation of Leon Plain of the Toyah
horizon, why then is this native ceramic type largely undifferentiated not only temporally across
the Toyah horizon – Mission period time frame, but also spatially across this region of Texas and
across the San Antonio and Coastal Franciscan missions. Examining attributes which may have
changed or perhaps more importantly persisted thorough time can allow inference of selected
traits and therefore discussion of their potential adaptive values.
Ceramic Expectations
As mentioned above, the Aranama would certainly have faced many changes upon
entering Mission Espíritu Santo. Among these changes would have been a shift in mobility and
subsistence practices. The Aranama being a mobile hunting and gathering group prior to
Spanish missionization, would have experienced increased sedentism as well as a reliance on
agriculture upon entering Espíritu Santo. Resultantly, the ceramics used in these two different
setting would be subject to differing degrees of stresses. It is expected that this change from a
more mobile hunting and gathering way of life to a more sedentary and agriculturally dependent
way of life would be evidenced in ceramic technology (Raymond 1999:76).
Starchy foods, such as corn, are easier to eat and digest, and perhaps even more nutritious
when cooked to gelatinization by simmering or boiling. This process means not only higher
49

temperatures required, but also longer cooking times than with other non-starchy foods (Braun
1983:116). It is expected that the Prehistoric Leon Plain vessels, which were not created or used
during a time of reliance on corn or starchy foods, would have been created with a focus on
mechanical stresses, such as hardness and strength (Rice 1987:228). While strength is referred to
as “durability” (Rice 1987:357), hardness includes resistance to “penetration, abrasion,
scratching, crushing, and resilience” (Shepard 1980:115). Resistance to impact shock would
certainly have been important for Toyah ceramics in resisting breakage due to dropping or any
type of “sharp blow” (Rice 1987:227, 360) that Toyah ceramics may have been subject to during
use or transit (Ulrich 2004:44). Thicker vessel walls would hedge against such mechanical
stresses and would also likely meet the lower thermal demands of hunting and gathering diets
(Raymond 1999:76). Echoing Raymond’s (1999:76) discussion, it would also be expected that
Leon Plain vessels should be smaller than Goliad vessels because mobility would restrict the size
of vessels transported. Additionally the proportion of bowls to jars would be such that bowls
were more numerous due to a lesser focus on the storage of foodstuffs, as mobile groups could
move to resolve food or resource shortages (Hood 2007:199).
Conversely, within the Goliad ware, it is expected that cooking vessels would have been
created to cope with thermal stresses. The Aranama diet within the mission would have a greater
reliance on corn and other starchy foods such as beans and potatoes (Ulrich 2004:45), therefore
resulting in greater “selective pressure for thermally efficient vessels” (Raymond 1999:33).
These thermal pressures or stresses would be evidenced in the ceramics in terms of thinner
vessels walls, which better conduct heat (Braun 1983:118, Rice 1987:227). Thinner vessel walls
transfer heat more evenly and efficiently as well as increase thermal shock resistance (Braun
1983, Rice 1987:227, Rye 1981:26). Therefore vessels used for cooking starchy foods such as
50

corn, would be expected to have thinner vessel walls, than their Leon Plain predecessors. Also
paralleling Raymond’s (1993:85) discussion, Goliad vessels, both for storage and cooking, are
expected to be larger than comparable Leon Plain vessels. Cooking dried maize for several
hours (Braun 1983:116, Hard et al. 1996) would require larger jars sufficient for steeping (Hard
et al. 1991). Due to the substantial cooking time, agriculturalists prepare larger volumes at a
time (Hard et al. 1991). Furthermore, the proportion of jars may increase compared to bowls due
to storage needs of agriculturally produced foods (Hood 2007:189-191). Since vessels used
within the more sedentary mission environment were likely not moved as much as vessels used
by mobile hunter gatherers, concerns for mechanical stresses, such as impact shock resistance
due to dropping or damage during transit, would likely wane, resulting in thinner vessel walls.
Within the mission the Aranama experienced increased sedentism likely allowing consistent
access to local clay sources (Ulrich 2004). Not only could these potters produce greater
quantities of ceramic vessels while residing within the mission, but also perhaps become more
proficient in this skill. In summary, within the Goliad ware assemblage, it is expected that jars
would have thinner walls, that jars would be larger in size, and also that jars should be more
numerous in respect to bowls.

51

CHAPTER SIX: METHODOLOGY
As previously discussed within this thesis, Goliad ware was a local native made ceramic
type. Likely made by the native Aranama population residing within Mission Espíritu Santo de
Zúñiga, Goliad ware is considered to be a Mission period continuation of Leon Plain ceramics
from the Toyah horizon. Many questions surround Goliad ware as to its origin and creators, and
aside from the small amounts of historic and ethnographic evidence referring to Goliad ware, to
date little detailed analysis of these ceramics have been conducted. If Goliad ware is a
continuation of Leon Plain ware, then what attributes of these ceramics may have been affected
by the various circumstances of the creators of this ware? It has been established that the native
populations of the Toyah horizon were mobile hunter gatherer groups. Upon entering the
missions, the mobile groups would have been subject to a much more sedentary way of life in
addition to a reliance on more agricultural type foods since ranching and agriculture were the
economic and nourishment stability of the Spanish missions. Therefore examining functional
attributes of the Goliad ware ceramics such as vessel form, lip treatment, orifice diameter, and
sherd thickness may offer a better understanding of what performance characteristics were
subject to selective processes. As sedentism increased, foodways among the native groups
changed from the pre-mission (late prehistoric) period to the Mission (proto-historic) period with
the introduction of Spanish mission culture. Though numerous Indigenous groups moved in and
out of the missions, some groups were more or less permanent residents (Ulrich 2004:51). It
would be expected that the ceramics might reflect this change in terms of different storage,
processing and cooking, as well as serving requirements. Additionally, the types or proportions
of vessels types may have changed as increased sedentism may correlate with a greater reliance
on storage vessels as well as larger storage vessels.
52

Aside from the differences that may be evident in these native ceramics over time, the
question also remains as to why Goliad ware is so very similar to Leon Plain, despite the
introduction of the Spanish mission culture. Additionally, the Spanish mission records show
various native groups residing within the missions. Specifically at Mission Espíritu Santo, the
Aranama and Tamique may have been the greatest in number, but the Karankawa also resided
for a time within this mission. Could the small number of Goliad black-on-buff and Goliad redon-buff simply be evidence of variation created by diffusion within the Goliad type and therefore
not have been under selection? Which functional attributes of these Goliad ware ceramics have
persisted temporally and spatially and what was their resultant adaptive significance? Though
many of these questions will require further research beyond the scope of this thesis, employing
this evolutionary perspective enables a discussion based on possible selection of technological
advantages as opposed to deeming change (or persistence) as a resultant and assumptive cause.

Within this thesis, a selection of native ceramics from the Goliad location of Mission
Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga were examined to gain a better understanding of possible ceramic traits
under selection and traits that have differentially persisted though time. Analysis of native
Goliad ware rim sherds not only offers insight into the form of vessels from which these sherds
came, but also functional attributes of the pottery. The utility of rim sherd analysis has been
established by many (Chase 1985, DeBoer 1980, Plog 1985, Rice 1987:222). Rim sherds can
allow for assessment of vessel form and function. Using rim sherds to determine vessel form
and also orifice size then allows comparison of functional traits within the sample and also
across assemblages. The rim sherds obtained for this thesis were excavated from Mission
Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga (41GD1), and are housed at the Texas Archeology Research Laboratory
53

(TARL) of the University of Texas at Austin. These rim sherds are from a combination of at
least two excavations carried out in the 1930s; A.T. Jackson’s excavation (see Ulrich et al. 2005:
Appendix A) and Erik Reed’s excavation (see Reed 1938). Rim sherds in this collection likely
also come from another investigation occurring simultaneously with Jackson’s excavation; this
investigation was conducted by the Goliad State Park (represented by Judge J. A. White, County
Judge of Goliad County - see Ulrich et al. 2005:6) (Laura Nightengale, personal
communication). The rim sherds from these three excavations at Mission Espíritu Santo de
Zúñiga at the final, Goliad location have been mixed by a previous researcher and there is no
way to determine which sherds came from which excavation (Laura Nightengale, personal
communication). The ceramics from A.T. Jackson’s 1933 excavation have been previously
examined by Mounger (1959) where some sherds have been reconstructed into whole vessels.
However for this thesis, only single Goliad Plain rim sherds not part of reconstructed vessels
were used. Additionally, though some rim sherds may have been large enough to include
handles or remnant portions of handles (Mounger 1959:170), rim sherds with handles were not
included in this analysis. The rim sherd collection provided by TARL totaled 2,509 Goliad Plain
rim sherds and included all the Goliad Plain rim sherds for 41GD1 (Mission Espíritu Santo at the
Goliad location) that were not part of reconstructed vessels, nor part of handle fragments. I
examined all of these sherds and recorded measurements for 807 of the total 2,509 rim sherds –
just a bit shy of one-third of the rim sherd collection was used.
The first step in the analysis was to examine all 2,509 rim sherds and determine which
ones were large enough to determine vessel form. If vessel form could not be determined, then
the sherd was set aside and not used in this analysis. Identifiable rims were initially separated

54

into bowl and jar forms. During this task, I was able to seek help when needed from more
experienced researchers in ceramic analysis at the Center for Archaeological Research.
After sorting the vessels by form, the rim profile was examined to further distinguish
among the bowls and jars, respectively. The jars, determined largely by points of inflection,
were further sorted into one of four types; everted rim necked jars, inverted rim necked jars,
direct rim necked jars, or inverted rim neckless jars (some refer to this as a tecomate). The bowls
were determined to be either shallow (everted rim) or deep bowls (direct rim) and again
separated accordingly. Of the 2,509 rim sherds, I was able to confidently determine vessel form
for 807 of the rim sherds. If there was any doubt as to vessel form, it was set aside and not used
in this analysis.
After the vessel forms were sorted, each sherd was selected from its respective bag and
assigned a sherd number. Assigning a sherd number not only ensured accurate recording of
measurements and attributes, but also ensured that I could then return to the sherd should it be
deemed necessary for further analysis myself, or for future researchers.
Attributes recorded included rim profile, vessel form, maximum and minimum orifice
diameter, lip treatment, as well as chord width, sherd width, and also rim sherd thickness at
2mm, 15mm, and 20mm from the lip. Additional attributes recorded included interior and
exterior surface treatment, sooting presence and location, and also a subjective assessment of
neck length for direct rim necked jars. Further descriptions of these attributes and measurements
as well as their potential utility in employing an evolutionary perspective will be discussed in the
following subsections.
Rim Profile
The rim profile refers to the position of the rim when oriented along a horizontal plane.
55

As noted above, this allows the positioning of the rim sherd as it most likely would have sat in
relation to its whole vessel form. This was done by holding up a sturdy flat clip board and
orienting the rim of the sherd against the bottom of the clip board so that as much of the rim as
possible touched the clip board. This step was done near a light source to ensure that as many
points of the rim as possible were touching the clip board. The rim sherd was rocked back and
forth until it came to a position where little or minimal light could shine through, indicating
maximum surface coverage of the rim against the clip board. Typically three, and often more
points of contact were made between the sherd and the clip board, including both ends of the top
of the rim sherd (essentially the lip of the rim) and a middle point, more or less center of the two
ends of the rim sherd (Rice 1987:222-223). Positioning the rim in such a fashion allowed for the
determination as to whether the rim of the vessel was in a direct, everted, or inverted position.
Additionally, by appropriately angling the rim sherd in this manner, the orientation of the vessel
orifice can be ascertained as it aligns parallel with the horizontal plane and allows for further
confirmation as to vessel form. If the sherd is not held in the orientation as it would have been
related to the whole vessel form, determining a change in vessel wall contour can be elusive.
A direct rim (Figure 6.1, a) was determined when the maximum surface area of the rim
touched the clip board in a perpendicular fashion. A direct rim with evidence of an inflection
point or change in vessel wall contour indicated a direct rim necked jar (Figure 6.2, a). A direct
rim with no change in vessel wall contour indicated a direct rim deep bowl (Figure 6.3, a). An
everted rim (Figure 6.1, b) is essentially one that curves outward. An everted rim was
determined when the maximum surface area of the rim touched the clip board in an outward
flaring or angled fashion. Perhaps a more simplified description is if the lip of the rim extends
outward from the vessel neck or body, this is an indication of an everted rim. An everted rim
56

with evidence of change in vessel wall contour indicated an everted rim necked jar (Figure 6.2,
b). If no change in vessel wall contour is visible, this is evidence of an everted bowl (see Figure
6.3, b for deep bowl and Figure 6.3, c for shallow bowl). Dependent on the degree of curvature
on the rim, as described by Ulrich et al (2005), a shallow bowl will have a greater downward
curve from a perpendicular plane than a deep bowl. Inverted rims (Figures 6.1, c and 6.1, d)
were determined when the maximum surface area of the rim touched the clip board in an inward
fashion. A more simplified description of an inverted rim is when the lip of the rim extends
inward toward the center of the vessel. An inverted rim with evidence of an inflection point or
change in contour of the vessel wall indicates an inverted rim necked jar (Figure 6.2, c). An
inverted rim with no visible change in vessel wall contour or inflection point indicates either and
inverted rim deep bowl (Figure 6.3, d) or an inverted rim neckless jar (sometimes referred to as a
tecomate, Figure 6.2, d). This tecomate style vessel is referred to as an inverted jar and not an
inverted bowl, because with a bowl, the orifice is unrestricted. As is the case with an inverted
rim neckless jar, the orifice is smaller than the vessel body and therefore restricted. Though rim
sherds indicating inverted rim neckless jars (tecomates) were few, they were quite apparent as
evidenced by the extreme angle at which the rim had to be oriented against the clip board. An
inverted rim with no indication of change in vessel wall contour could also be classified as an
inverted rim deep bowl. The difference in determining an inverted rim neckless jar from an
inverted rim bowl was determined by the portion of the lip that touched the clipboard. With the
inverted rim neckless jars, the angle of the rim sherd was so extreme that it was almost as if the
outside vessel wall was touching the clip board. With inverted rim deep bowls, the rim was
angled slightly inward so that almost the very top of the lip was touching the clip board.

57

Furthermore, when properly orienting the rim, it became apparent that the vessel orifice was
unrestricted (Raymond 1999).
The rim profile aids in inferring vessel function. “The rim may be a means of
strengthening the orifice, or modifying form for functional purposes – pouring, lifting, and
retaining liquids – or of affording a decorative effect” (Shepard 1954:247). For example, a
vessel rim that curves inward would not likely be used for pouring liquids and perhaps function
as a storage container. On the contrary, a vessel rim that curves outward may aid in pouring
liquids, or even allow easier access for cooking or serving (Hally 1986). Additionally since the
rim profile coupled with the vessel form allows for a more complete description of vessel types,
changes in vessel types or the proportions of vessels types can be examined over time. This may
allow inference as to whether the rim type is functional or decorative.

Vessel Form
The form of a vessel refers to the actual shape of the vessel. Common terminology
employed in discussing vessel form includes jars, bowls, pots, ollas, and tecomates, among
others. Generally speaking, vessels have three basic parts; the base, body, and orifice (Rice
1987:212-213). The base or foot of a vessel is “the underside of a vessel, touching the surface it
rests on during normal use” (Rice 1987:212-213). The body of the vessel is considered to be the
middle portion of the vessel between the base and the orifice. The orifice, “or mouth opening”
of a vessel can be restricted making access to vessel contents more difficult, or the orifice can be
unrestricted allowing easy access to vessel contents (Rice 1987:212-213). Furthermore, the
orifice of a vessel also includes the neck of the vessel, and presence of a neck essentially defines
the vessel as a jar (Rice 1987:216). It is important to note that there are some exceptions and
some vessels that are referred to as jars do not have necks, such as tecomates and other such type
vessels (Rice 1987:216-217). As noted by Rice, referring to a vessel as a bowl or jar is common
but also particularly vague, and though standardization of vessel form terminology seems ideal,
there are always exceptions and “specialized shapes” (Rice 1987:217). For example, if a neck
defines a jar, then neckless jars should technically not exist, yet they do (Rice 1987:217).
However for this thesis, categorization as bowl or jar aids in sorting between vessels forms.
A rim sherd is denoted by the portion of the mouth opening, or orifice that remains part
of the sherd. In this analysis, vessel form was determined by orienting the rim of the sherd on a
horizontal plane and then visually examining the vertical position of the sherd to inspect for
changes in the contour of the sherd (Shepard 1954:226, 245). When the rim sherd is vertically
oriented with the rim on top, the sherd is then positioned more or less as it would have been
when part of the whole vessel and thus becomes easier to visualize vessel form. Shepard
59

discusses inflection points where “the curvature changes from concave to convex or vice versa”
(1954:116). Taking this idea and applying it to the rim sherds essentially entailed identifying a
change in direction of the curvature of the vessel wall. If there was a change in curvature of the
vessel wall as evidenced in the rim sherd, then the vessel was classified as a jar. If there was no
change in curvature of the rim sherd and the vessel wall continued to follow along the same
contour, then the vessel was classified as a bowl. Though seemingly simplified in this
description, changes in curvature are not always clearly obvious which makes discerning
between a bowl and a jar a sometimes difficult task. Determining the rim profile as discussed
next, further aids in deciphering vessel form. From an evolutionary perspective, determining
vessel form can be of value because it allows a ratio calculation which can infer dependence on
these vessel types. For example, an increase in the proportion of storage vessels might be
expected in an increasingly sedentary or agriculturally dependent environment.

Orifice Diameter
After establishing the rim profile and vessel form, the orifice diameter of each sherd was
then recorded. Since the proper orientation of the rim sherd against a horizontal plane was
already determined, the “arc of the rim” (Shepard 1954:245) could then be aligned on a
concentric ring chart (Shepard:222-223). As described by Ulrich et al., “to determine vessel
orifice diameter, the sherd was placed rim down on a concentric circle template, positioning the
sherd so that the lip rested on the flat surface” (2005:42). The centermost ring on the concentric
ring template measured one centimeter (1cm) in diameter and each successive ring increased by
1cm in diameter. Since each ring was spaced accordingly, no further mathematical manipulation
of the data was required because where the sherd fit on the ring designated the actual best fit
orifice diameter. This measurement was recorded in centimeters.
For this measurement, some amount of error is expected (DeBoer 1980, Rice 1987:223).
Aside from the fact that the orientation of the rim sherd was essentially upside down for this
measurement, Goliad ceramics are rather crudely made nearly always with uneven rims.
Therefore determining a best fit to the concentric ring chart was sometimes difficult, especially
61

dependent on the arc of the rim (Rice 1987:223). Given this obstacle, a maximum best fit and
minimum best fit to the concentric ring chart were recorded and an average of the two
measurements was used to estimate vessel orifice diameter (Raymond 1999:46).
Estimating orifice diameter allows inference to overall vessel size, however as
demonstrated by Hally, this does not always hold true and exceptions are possible (1986:272).
Vessel orifice diameter can also infer capacity for which the vessel functioned as one would not
expect, say, a cooking vessel with need for constant tending to have a small orifice diameter.
Along these same lines, vessel orifice size may aid in inferring “maximum fill level” in vessels
used for liquid containment (including cooking) since a constriction of the vessel orifice would
likely signify this point (Hally 1098:279). The orifice diameter measurement can additionally be
used in discussions of vessel content heat loss, spilling, and evaporation (Hally 1986).
Lip Treatment
Though the terms lip and rim are often employed interchangeably, the lip of a vessel
specifically refers to the edge of the mouth of a vessel (Rice 1987:214). Lip treatment or lip
form for this rim sherd analysis was designated as either, rounded, pointed, or flat (Figure 6.4).
Shepard states that in creating a ceramic vessel by hand, it is the position of the potter’s “thumb
and fingers” that “will determine whether it is rounded, tapered, or squarish” (1954:247). As
noted by Ulrich et al., “lip form may be an indicator of the style of an individual or of cultural
groups of potters” (2005:42). From an evolutionary perspective, if lip treatment is stylistic and
not functional, then the frequencies of these lip treatment types will likely vary through time and
can be attributed to stochastic processes.

Chord Width
Chord width refers to the measurement of the intact lip of the rim sherd, measured from
one end of the rim sherd to the other. Chord width is not the exact length of the curved line of
the rim, but rather the straight line measurement of the intact lip from broken end to broken end.
This measurement was recorded to reference the viability of the sherd for analysis, specifically in
reference to actual amount of lip present on the rim, but also in reference to orifice diameter.
Typically, a smaller chord width means a less reliable measurement of orifice diameter (Shepard
1954:245). Conversely, a larger chord width means a more reliable measurement of orifice
diameter. Intuitively this seems obvious as there is more lip of the rim sherd available to align
with the concentric rings on the diameter chart. This measurement was taken with digital
calipers and recorded in millimeters.
Sherd Width
The measurement of sherd width was also taken with digital calipers. Sherd width refers
to the widest measurement of the sherd. Sherd width is the maximum measurement of the sherd
parallel to, or at the rim. Many rim sherds contained just a portion of the intact lip, yet had a
much more significant portion of the neck or body of the vessel. This would be evidenced in the
63

data where the chord width is less than the sherd width. For some sherds, the rim was the widest
part of the sherd and can easily be detected in the data as such where the chord width equals the
sherd width. When orienting the arc of the rim on the concentric ring template, envisioning the
continuation of the width of the vessel neck or body aids in placement and proper orientation
along the template. When the sherd width was greater than the chord width, this often aided in
placement along the template. The measurement of sherd width provides a partial measurement
of overall sherd size, and also may support the accuracy of the orifice diameter measurement, as
well as vessel form. This measurement was taken with digital calipers and recorded in
millimeters.
Sherd Length
Sherd length was the perpendicular measurement of the longest point of the sherd from
the lip. It is the vertical measurement from the lip straight down to where the sherd fractured
from the body of the vessel. This measurement provides an idea of how big the sherd was in
relation to other sherds within this assemblage as well as in relation to the chord width and sherd
width of the sherd itself. This measurement was taken with digital calipers and recorded in
millimeters.

Sherd Thickness
Sherd thickness refers to the measurement of the sherd from outside wall to inside wall of
the ceramic fragment. This measurement is essentially the thickness of the vessel wall as
evidenced in the rim sherd. This measurement was taken at 2 mm from the lip, 15 mm from the
lip, and 20 mm from the lip. To do so required again, use of digital calipers to measure the
thickness, but also use of a flexible, transparent ruler to measure the distance in millimeters from
the lip. The ruler was aligned with the top, or lip, of the rim sherd and at the point 2 mm below
the rim, the digital calipers were used to measure the sherd’s thickness. Without moving the
ruler, to ensure the relative distance from rim remained constant, the calipers were again used to
measure the thickness of the sherd at 15 mm below the rim and 20 mm below the rim as well.
To ensure accuracy of this measurement, the ruler was aligned as closely as possible with the
fractured edge of the rim sherd. This allowed the calipers to be placed as closely as possible to
the millimeter indicators marks on the ruler. Furthermore when aligning the ruler with the lip of
the rim and edge of the sherd, care was taken to include as much length of the sherd as possible
from the rim down toward where the body of the vessel would have been so that the
measurements at 15 mm and 20 mm could be included without having to reposition the ruler.
These measurements were also recorded in millimeters.
Vessel wall thickness is not simply a result of forming requirements when a vessel is
created. Vessel wall thickness also has thermal and mechanical consequences for its use-life.
“Since wall thickness affects the thermal properties of the vessel, this variable is identified as
functional; hence, the change can be attributed to selection” (Broughton and O’Connell
1999:157). Thick vessel walls can prove advantageous in some cases. For storage vessels, thick
walls mean increased vessel stability as well as ability to retain or exclude moisture (Rice
65

1987:227). Thick walls on ceramics used for processing foods “are likely to be stronger and
more resistant to sharp blows during pounding, stirring, or mixing” (ibid). Thin vessel walls can
be advantageous as well. Thin vessel walls not only conduct heat well, they also increase
thermal shock resistance (Braun 1983:118-119). From an evolutionary perspective, various
environmental pressures may lead to differences in vessel wall thickness as different mechanical
or thermal stresses arise. For example, processing needs for foods may change, or subsistence
strategies may change over time, and may be reflected in selected functional attributes of
ceramics, such as the thickness of a vessel’s wall.
Surface Treatment
Surface treatment refers to the amount of shine or polish visible on the wall of the sherd.
Discerning this attribute was largely subjective and was recorded as either none, mild, moderate,
or heavy. Additionally, surface treatment was recorded for both the interior and exterior of the
sherd. The designation none indicated that the sherd had no evidence whatsoever of smoothing.
The designation of heavy indicated a noticeably visible shine and looked highly polished, with
no breaks in the shine across the sherd surface. Moderate was used when the shine or smoothing
was visible on the majority of the sherd, but not consistent so that gaps of unsmoothed areas
were also visible. The designation of mild was used when the majority of the sherd appeared to
have no polishing or smoothing except for small areas where a shine were evident. It is possible
that depositional processes may have affected or eroded some of the surface treatment (Black
1982, 1986). This attribute may be useful in further discerning vessel function as bowls typically
have an interior polish and jars an exterior polish (Black 1982, 1986a, 1986b:91, Hood 2007:11).

66

Sooting Presence and Location
In this analysis, the term sooting is used as an attribute to describe any type of evidence
that fire came in contact with the sherd and resultantly left blackened areas. Sooting typically
indicates that a vessel was used with fire, and the location of the sooting can aid in determining
how the vessel was used (Rice 1987:235). As Rice describes, sooting occurring mainly on the
sides of a vessel from the base up, indicate the vessel was probably set in the fire, while sooting
on the base (as well as the sides) indicates suspension over a fire probably for frying or
simmering (Rice 1987:235). In addition to sooting being indicative of cooking use, sooting, in
this thesis was also used synonymously with “fire clouding” (Rye 1981:120). Therefore
blackened areas evidenced on sherds might also be the result of “differential access to air during
firing and cooling” of a vessel (Rye 1981:120). Additionally, a sherd may be blackened because
it was burned postuse or postdeposition (Rice 1987:345). Resultantly, the attribute of Sooting
Presence was recorded as yes or no for each sherd. If a blackened area was evidenced on the rim
sherd, then the Sooting Location was recorded as being on the interior of the vessel wall, the
exterior of the vessel wall, or both (indicating sooting on both the interior and exterior wall).
Additionally the term burned was recorded for this attribute. Burned was used when the sherd
clearly appeared burned, marked by an entirely or nearly entirely blackened sherd. This included
blackening not only on the interior and exterior walls, but also along the breaks of the sherd.
Neck Length
This attribute was subjectively recorded as an ordinal number referring to the neck length
of the direct rimmed necked jars. This attribute was added to the analysis after analyzing
approximately two-hundred sherds and applies only to the necked jars with direct rims. While
conducting my analysis, I began to notice that the necked jars with direct rims appeared to have
67

varying neck lengths. An actual measurement of the neck length was not possible since sherds
most often did not include the portion of the vessel where the neck actually met the body.
Therefore an ordinal descriptor of 1, 2, or 3 was assigned to this vessel type. A long neck was
recorded as the number 1, a very short neck was recorded as the number 3, and necks of medium
length that fell anywhere between the extremes of the 1 or 3 descriptor were designated as
number 2. Since each rim sherd was assigned a sherd number, I was able to look through my
data to determine which already analyzed sherds were direct rimmed necked jars, examine them
again, and assign a neck length. Moving forward from there, direct rimmed necked jars were
assigned an ordinal descriptor in reference to neck length.
Rim sherd omissions
As noted previously, approximately two-thirds of the rim sherds obtained from TARL for
this thesis had to be excluded from this analysis. A total of 1,702 of the 2,509 rim sherds were
deemed inadequate for this analysis. Numerous reasons for exclusion became apparent as each
sherd was carefully inspected. The largest numbers of rim sherds were excluded because vessel
form could not be determined. Reasons for inability to determine vessel form were largely due
to small size of the rim sherd. In most cases, not enough body portion of the vessel was present
in the rim sherd to determine vessel type. In some cases however, the sherd lacked curvature to
indicate what vessel type it came from. If it could not be determined that the contour of the
vessel was continuing along the same curve or if the point of inflection was merely after the
breakage point of the sherd from the rest of the body of the vessel, it was excluded. Essentially,
if an insufficient portion of the rim sherd existed to confidently determine if the vessel was a
bowl or a jar, it was excluded. Furthermore, when vessel type could be inferred from visual

68

determination, but the rim profile could not be determined, the sherd was likewise eliminated
from the analysis.
Other reasons for exclusion include poor rim quality. This included if the actual lip
portion the rim present was quite small and not enough actual rim portion of the sherd existed as
this would make estimating vessel orifice diameter difficult or impossible. Also a sherd with
only a small amount of actual rim present also meant difficulty in properly orienting the sherd to
determine rim profile appropriately. Poor rim quality also included sherds where the rims were
too inconsistent due to poor manufacturing quality to determine rim profile. In addition, some
sherds had rims that were too inconsistent due to deterioration/degradation of the actual lip/rim
and were also omitted from this analysis.
“Unknown” notation
The term “unknown” was used in the data set to indicate a measurement that was
indeterminate. When “unknown” appears in the rim thickness measurement column of the data,
this signifies that the sherd was not long enough to include this measurement. For example, the
measurement for rim thickness at 20 mm from the lip for sherd number 67 has been recorded as
unknown (see Appendix). This means that rim sherd number 67 was not 20 mm long (from lip
down toward base) and therefore the measurement was unknown and could not be recorded.
When “unknown” appears in the maximum or minimum orifice diameter column, this indicates
that the rim sherd could not be oriented appropriately to record a measurement. Most often, as is
the case with rim sherds number 49 or 53, such a small portion of the rim was present that it was
impossible to assign a measurement with any amount of confidence, as their chord width
measurements indicate 10.37mm and 9.04mm respectively. Accordingly, if either a maximum or
minimum orifice diameter was recorded as unknown, then the average orifice diameter could not
69

be calculated. Therefore an “unknown” appearing in the average orifice diameter column
indicates that either the maximum or minimum measurement, or both measurements, could not
be determine

70

CHAPTER SEVEN: RESULTS
As previously discussed, numerous changes would have been experienced as mobile
hunter gatherer groups entered the missions. Among the changes considered here are an increase
in sedentism and a reliance on agriculture, specifically corn and other starchy foods.
Expectations for these changes in mobility and subsistence have been correlated with different
performance characteristics of pottery (Raymond 1999, Ulrich 2004). Increased sedentism and a
reliance on corn are expected to be evident in the Goliad ceramics such that jars should be
greater in number than bowls, jars should be large, and vessel walls should be thinner to
compensate for thermal stresses. To examine these expectations, functional attributes of Goliad
ware rim sherds from Mission Espíritu Santo have been analyzed.
Selected attributes of 807 Goliad Plain rim sherds from Mission Espíritu Santo were
recorded for this thesis (see Appendix). Of the 807 sherds, 405 were determined to be bowls and
402 were determined to be jars. In very general terms of bowl or jar, the amount of each vessel
type is nearly equal, 50.2% and 49.8% respectively. In total, 405 rim sherds were from bowls,
and 402 rim sherds were from jars. Of the 405 rim sherds representing bowl form, 304 were
deep bowls and 101 were shallow bowls. Of the 402 jars, 394 were necked jars and 8 were
neckless jars. This data and their percentages are summarized in Table 5 and depicted in Figure
7.1 and show that bowls outnumber jars, though slightly.

These vessel forms can be further discussed in relation to rim form as seen in Table 6.
Vessel types include deep bowls with everted, inverted, or direct rims and shallow bowls with
everted rims and two sherds perhaps indicate direct rims as well. Additional vessel types include
necked jars with everted, inverted, or direct rims and neckless jars with inverted rims. As
indicated by zeros in Table 6, three vessel types: shallow inverted bowls, neckless everted rim
jars, and neckless direct rim jars, either do not exist or were not represented in this sample.
Comparing these three vessel types with the ones recorded by Mounger (1959) and Ulrich et al.
(2005) supports the supposition that the three vessel types do not exist. Furthermore, it is
questionable that there were only two shallow bowls with direct rims. Since a sufficient portion
of the sherd was available to determine these two sherds as bowls, perhaps the lack of uniformity
or consistency in the lip formation processes resulted in this profile.

Here in Table 6, it becomes evident that deep bowls with direct rims comprise the largest
portion of the total sherd sample at 28.7%, followed closely by direct rim necked jars at 25.7%.
Reflecting the overall near equal ratio of bowls to jars as mentioned above, deep bowls with
direct rims only slightly outnumber the percentage of necked jars with direct rims. Also, at
54.6%, the majority of rim sherds were of direct rim profile (n=441). Inverted rims at 12.9% of
the total sherds were the least in number (n=104), and the percentage of everted rims (32.1%)
falls in between. As noted in Table 6, 0.4% (n=3/807) of the total rim sherds in this analysis
were determined to be necked jars with questionable rim profile and therefore recorded as
unknown. These sherds occur in the data set because these three necked jars were originally
determined to be direct in rim profile, but upon reexamining these rim sherds, some reluctance
was met in confidently determining whether the rim profile was direct or everted.
Direct rims on deep bowls and necked jars also comprise the largest frequency within
these respective vessel types (see Figure 7.2). However when comparing proportions of rim
profile by vessel form, among the deep bowls there is a substantial difference in rim profile
73

frequency, with direct rims comprising 76% (n= 232/304) of all the deep bowls. However
among the rim sherds indicative of shallow bowls, 98% (n= 99/101) were of an everted rim
profile. Also among the neckless jars, inverted rims comprised 100% (n=8/8) of this vessel
form. This large difference in frequency of rim profile for the different vessel types however
does not extend to the necked jar vessel form as 53% (n= 207/391) were direct rim, 38% (n=
148/391) were everted rim, and 9% (n= 207/391) had an inverted rim. In summary, among the
deep bowl form, direct rims were the most abundant. Among the shallow bowl form, everted
rims were the most abundant. Among the neckless jars, inverted rims were the most abundant.
However for all the necked jars in this analysis, though the most abundant rim profile was direct,
it was not exceedingly so as with the other vessel forms.

Figure 7.2: Rim Profile Percentage of Total Sherds by Vessel Form
Differences in mean orifice diameter by vessel type are displayed in Table 7. Deep bowls
with everted rims represent the largest average orifice diameter of all the vessel types, with a
74

mean of 18.59cm. Interestingly, there is little difference in average orifice size between inverted
rim necked jars, direct rim deep bowls, and everted rim necked jars as their means are 16.91cm,
16.28 cm, and 16.10 cm, respectively. Direct rim necked jars with an average orifice diameter of
15.07 cm, inverted rim deep bowls with an average orifice diameter of 15.01cm, and everted rim
shallow bowl with an average orifice diameter of 14.74 cm, also similarly have close means.
However inverted rim neckless jar definitely show the smallest average orifice diameter at
12.07cm.
From this data it appears that on average, orifice diameters of everted rim deep bowls
(18.59cm) and inverted rim neckless jars (12.07cm) represent the furthest ends of the vessel
mouth size/diameter spectrum. This intuitively makes sense as bowls are vessels with
unrestricted access, and jars are vessels with some degree of restricted access to aid in
containment (storage uses). Further influenced by the rim profile, and everted rim would also
allow easy access to vessel contents whereas an inverted rim would permit more restricted access
to vessel contents. However these vessel types with the largest and smallest average orifice
diameter only differ from their next closest vessel type in average orifice size by 1.68cm
(inverted necked jars = 16.91cm) and 2.67cm (everted rim shallow bowls = 14.74cm)
respectively, which overall is not a vastly significant difference. So in comparison to the ends of
the spectrum there is a difference in size, however, in relation to each vessel type, differences
among average orifice diameter are more subtle (see Table 7). Overall the average orifice
diameter of each vessel type is somewhat similar. As visible in Figure 7.3, though neckless jars
have the smallest average orifice diameter and everted deep bowls have the largest vessel
diameter, the number sherds representing these vessels (everted rim deep bowls=12, inverted rim
neckless jars=8) is comparatively small to the overall size of the data set (n=807 sherds). There
75

is not a noticeable size difference among orifice size of the remaining vessel types, which was
not expected. Assuming corn was being processed in large quantities due to the substantial
length of time required to render the corn more digestible and nutritious (Braun 1983), jars were
expected to be larger.

The thickness of each rim sherd was measured at 2 millimeters from the lip, 15
millimeters from the lip, and 20 millimeters from the lip (see Table 8). Since Goliad ware tends
76

to be rather crudely made and vessels often contain inconsistencies, it seemed erroneous to take
only one measurement of thickness upon which to base results.

Much as the other attributes have shown, rim sherd thickness is also quite consistent
across vessel types (see Figure 7.4). Shallow bowls deviate from the others, yet this is likely due
to the fact that there are only two of these sherds. Aside from the fact that only two sherds
provide an inadequate sample size for statistical analyses, seeing how much the thickness differs
between the two rim profiles of shallow bowls is inconsistent with the variation in thickness
among rim profiles of the other vessel types. This is true not only at the average thickness
measurement at 2 mm from the lip, but also at the 15 mm measurements and 20 mm
measurements as well (see Figures 7.5, 7.6, and 7.7). Even if assuming the two direct rim
shallow bowls are not an analysis error, then the difference among the thickest and thinnest
vessel types is still a matter of less than two millimeters (2 mm) which is quite nearly
imperceptible. Since it is expected that vessels within this assemblage have different use
functions (water storage, food storage, cooking, etc.), vessels used for cooking were expected to
have thinner walls. Though this is not represented in the data, a comparison between sherd
77

thickness of Leon Plain rim sherds to the results within this thesis could aid in determining if
vessel walls were thinning over time, due to the addition of corn in native diets.

Upon further examination of lip treatment, it becomes evident that rim sherds with
rounded lips are the majority of all vessel forms, with neckless jars being somewhat of an
exception. In total there were only eight sherds from neckless jars, of which there was a nearly
equal amount of pointed, rounded, and flat rims (see Table 9 and Figure 7.9). Necked jars and
deep bowls are quite similar in proportions of lip treatment within each respective vessel form as
both most commonly have rim sherds with rounded lips, followed by flat lips, and then pointed
lips. Like necked jars and deep bowls, shallow bowls rim sherds have mostly rounded lips.
However the next greatest lip treatment is pointed lips among the shallow bowls and only 2 out
of 101 total shallow bowl sherds had flat lips.

Percentages of total rounded lip treatments, total flat lip treatments and total pointed lip
treatments can be viewed in Figures 7.10, 7.11, and 7.12 respectively. In these charts, the lip
treatment data is displayed in terms of total lip treatment type by vessel form. Displaying the
data in this fashion, it becomes apparent that aside from neckless jars, rim sherds with pointed
lips are more evenly distributed across vessel types than sherds with rounded or flat lips.
Though rim sherds with pointed lips make up the smallest proportion of total sherds (n = 18%,
see Figure 7.8), the overall distribution of rim sherds with pointed lips is more balanced with
38.93% being necked jars, 34.23% being deep bowls, and 24.83% being shallow bowls (see
Figure 7.12). Additionally, rim sherds with flat lips are nearly all necked jars or deep bowls.
Rounded lip rim sherds make up the greatest percentage of total rim sherds (n = 54%, see Figure
7.8), but out of the total rounded lip rim sherds, necked jars comprise slightly more than half of
the vessel forms represented (see Figure 7.10).
Though general vessel form (deep bowl, shallow bowl, necked jar, neckless jar) aids in basic
categorization of these Goliad ceramics, by including the rim profile as well to infer the vessel
type (direct rim deep bowl, everted rim necked jar, etc.) allows for a more accurate portrayal of
this rim sherd sample. Though of all the vessel forms (except neckless jars) rim sherds with
rounded lips are the majority (Figure 7.9), this does not hold true when further incorporating rim
profile. This is because for deep bowls with everted rims and neckless jars with inverted rims,
the number of rim sherds with rounded lips and pointed lips are equal (see Table 10 and Figure
7.13). For shallow bowls with direct rims, the only lip treatment recorded was pointed however
there were only two total sherds representing this vessel type.

Though it appears that sherds with rounded lips are more or less the majority lip
treatment across vessel types, in terms of the next most common lip treatment, seems to suggest
a pattern, again direct rim shallow bowls excluded (see Figure 7.13). In terms of most common
lip treatment by vessel type, there are three general patterns. One pattern (I will refer to as
Pattern A) is where rim sherds with rounded lips are the greatest in number, followed by flat lips,
and then pointed lips. The next (I will refer to as Pattern B) is where rim sherds with rounded
lips are the greatest in number, followed by pointed lips, and then flat lips. Lastly is Pattern C
where rim sherds with rounded lip and pointed lips are of equal majority followed by flat lips.
Vessel types that fall into Pattern A include deep bowl with direct and inverted rims as
well as necked jars with directed and inverted rims. Vessel types that fall into Pattern B include
shallow bowls with everted rims and necked jars with everted rims. Pattern C includes the vessel
types of deep bowls with everted rims and neckless jars with inverted rims. These patterns may
suggest a correlation between lip treatment and rim profile since Pattern A includes only direct
and inverted rim profiles, Pattern B includes only everted rim profiles. Pattern C, though it
includes everted and inverted rim profiles, only 2.5% of the total number of rim sherds are
84

present in this pattern (n = 20/807). This might hint at the fact that lip treatment may be
functional as related to vessel type and perhaps does not vary stochastically, however additional
research is certainly required.

In comparing mean orifice diameters across vessel types by lip treatments (Table 11) the
data is rather randomly distributed (Figure 7.14). There does not appear to be any correlation
between lip treatment and orifice diameter as rim sherds with pointed, rounded, and flat lip vary
in relation to orifice size across vessel types. Worthy of mention perhaps is that mean orifice
diameter of everted rim necked jars is rather consistent across lip treatments with flat lips being

85

only slightly greater in diameter. The only other vessel type where flat rims are correlated with a
larger orifice diameter is shallow bowls with everted rims.

Lastly examined within this data set is rim sherd thickness measured at 2 mm from the lip
in relation to lip treatment (Table 12, Figure 7.15). For all bowl vessel forms, rim sherd
86

thickness at 2mm is greatest for rounded lip treatments. This is also true of necked and neckless
inverted rim jars. On average, only direct and everted necked jars are thickest at 2mm from the
lip if they have a flat lip treatment. The difference between thickness at 2mm from the lip of
each lip treatment only vary within a margin of 1.1 mm to 1.4 mm. Again, in relation to rim
sherd thickness at 2mm from the lip and lip treatment, there appears to be no correlation.

CHAPTER 8: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
A brief history of the Spanish presence in Texas has been established within this thesis,
specifically in relation to the establishment of Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de
Zúñiga. Prior to Spanish presence, this area of modern day Texas was an undeveloped
environment inhabited by various mobile native hunting and gathering groups. One such group,
the Aranama, were the predominant focus of missionization efforts at Mission Espíritu Santo. In
the 1930s, archaeological excavations conducted at this mission site in Goliad County (41GD1)
(see Ulrich et al. 2005 Appendix A, Reed 1938) unearthed large amounts of native made
ceramics. These ceramics were later examined and discussed in a thesis by Maria Mounger in
1959. In this thesis the ceramics received their Goliad name. Also in her thesis, Mounger (1959)
correlated the Aranama with the Goliad ware.
It has generally been accepted that Goliad ware is a continuation of prehistoric Leon
Plain ware of the Toyah horizon. Both these ceramics types are found in congruent areas and are
remarkably similar not only in terms of form but also technology. It has been noted that the
distinction between Goliad ware and Leon Plain is largely a matter of the context in which it was
found. The demarcation between the late prehistoric and the early historic/protohistoric is
essentially Spanish presence. If the ware is found in Spanish mission context then it is deemed
Goliad ware, but if the ceramics are associated with a Toyah site, then they are deemed Leon
Plain (Black 1986, Perttula 2002, Ricklis 1999a, Walter 2007).
So how does this rim sherd analysis relate to the above information and the theory of
evolutionary archaeology? The historical background establishes the time frame in which these
ceramics existed. Since evolution requires a temporal component, establishing the Goliad ware
as a continuation of Leon Plain allows for the creation of a time line of the existence of these
88

wares. Furthermore, the introduction of the Spanish missions meant a slew of changes for the
bands and groups of Indigenous population in the area that extended far beyond the introduction
of the Spanish language and Catholicism. The changes not only affected the native people’s
landscape, but also affected subsistence practices as well as mobility, especially so for those
native groups that entered the missions. The Aranama residing within Mission Espíritu Santo
would have been subject to such changes.
The Aranama retained some of their mobility as they often fled the mission for periods of
time and also continued hunting and gathering to supplement their diets. However, entering the
mission meant increased sedentism as well as change in subsistence practices, namely a reliance
on corn. Since Espíritu Santo experienced much success in cattle ranching there was less likely a
need for large game hunting. Also, the Aranama also would have been exposed to agriculture
which would not only mean less need for gathering foods, but also a change in types of foods
being eaten, specifically a reliance on corn (as well as other starchy foods such as beans and
potatoes (Ulrich 2004:45). Additionally, these starchy foods necessitate additional processing
requirements to render their full nutritional potential as well as increase digestibility and
palatability (Braun 1983:116, Hard et al. 1996).
As mobile hunting and gathering groups become more sedentary and agrarian, an
expectation arises in that a change might be evidenced in the creation and use of ceramics.
Pottery is not only subject to the physical and social environment in which and from which it
was created, but also for which it was created. These different environmental pressures, whether
they relate to available clay and temper resources or the intended use environment of the end
product ceramic, all relate to functional attributes which shape the performance characteristics of
pottery. In these different and changing environments ceramics might be exposed to entirely
89

new or differing degrees of thermal and mechanical stresses. For example, mobile groups would
likely expose their ceramics to different mechanical stresses than sedentary groups as they might
require ceramics that are not too cumbersome yet durable enough for transport. It is assumed
that ceramics correlated with mobile hunting and gathering groups (such as Leon Plain wares)
will have thicker walls to resist stresses from impact shock. Conversely, it is assumed that
impact shock resistance is less important in a more sedentary environment (such as within the
missions) and therefore thermal stresses related to cooking starchy foods will be evidenced in
thinner vessel wall which not only conduct heat more evenly and efficiently, but are also more
resistant to thermal sock. Additionally, it is assumed that larger jars and a greater proportion of
jars would be evidenced in a more sedentary agricultural environment (i.e. the missions) since
processing starchy foods requires substantial amounts of time and is typically conducted on a
larger scale. These stresses, both mechanical and thermal will likely be reflected in the
functional attributes of the ceramics over time since functional attributes of ceramics are aligned
with different performance characteristics of the vessels. The Aranama, for example, upon
entering Mission Espíritu Santo would need their ceramics to withstand any new processing or
cooking needs required by the addition of corn, and other new foods, into their diets.
Examining the changes in frequencies of functional attributes over time, allows for
determination of which of these attributes, if any, were subject to selective pressures given the
environmental circumstances. As referred to above, driving these selective pressures were likely
increased sedentism and a shift in subsistence practices. In future research, by comparing the
data from this Goliad rim sherd analysis to a similar data set of Leon Plain ceramics, changes in
frequencies of these attributes over this late prehistoric/protohistoric time period can be
examined. Since the major change between the native people and their ceramics during this time
90

frame was the introduction of Spanish presence, the driving selective forces can be somewhat
inferred. However, it is upon examining the functional attributes of these ceramics that offers
credibility to what these selective forces might have actually been.
Of the total 2,509 Goliad ceramic rim sherds within this collection, 807 were selected for
analysis. After determining the vessel form, rim profile, and lip treatment, the numeric attributes
requiring measurement were recorded. The measurements of chord width, sherd length, and
sherd width provide an idea of not only the size of the sherd, but also the actual amount of intact
rim on the sherd. Measurements of rim sherd thickness and orifice diameter were recorded and
then compared across vessel types (vessel form including rim profile) and also vessel types
including lip treatments.
The data presented within this thesis shows that, speaking in quite general terms of bowls
and jars, there was a near equal quantity. Of a total 807 rim sherds analyzed, 50.2% were bowls
and 49.8% were jars. However when accounting for vessel form and rim profile, deep bowls
with direct rims are the majority (28.7%), which is followed closely by direct rim necked jars
(25.7%) (Table 6). Regarding rim profile, of the necked jars (n = 391), 53% had direct rims (n =
207), 38% had everted rims (n = 148) and only 9% had inverted rims (n = 36). Of the total 304
deep bowls, 76% (n = 232) had direct rims, 20% had inverted rims (n = 60), and only 4% (n =
12) had everted rims. Of the 101 total shallow bowls, 98% had an everted rim (n = 99), and only
2% (n = 2) had a direct rim. All the neckless jars had an inverted rim profile.
Overall as can be compared in Figure 7.2, the most numerous to least numerous of vessel
type are as follows: deep bowls with direct rims, necked jars with direct rims, necked jars with
everted rims, shallow bowls with everted rims, deep bowls with inverted rims, necked jars with

91

inverted rims, deep bowls with everted rims, neckless jars with inverted rims, and lastly shallow
bowls with direct rims.
The average orifice diameter was largest for everted deep bowls with a mean of 18.59 cm
and smallest for inverted neckless jars at 12.07 cm. The remaining vessel types fall within a
smaller range of average orifice diameter (16.91 – 14.74 cm) in the following order from greatest
to smallest: inverted rim necked jars, direct rim deep bowls, everted rim necked jars, direct rim
necked jars, inverted rim deep bowls, and everted rim shallow bowls (Table 7).
The rim sherd thickness attribute has interesting results in that the mean thickness across
vessel types are quite similar (Figure 7.4). All three rim profiles for necked jars and deep bowls
show little variation (less than 1 mm) in mean thickness at 2, 15, and 20 mm from the lip
(Figures 7.5, 7.6, 7.7). Results for shallow bowls with everted rims are quite similar to the
previously noted necked jars and deep bowls, however the difference between rim profiles for
shallow bowls deviates slightly more. This likely is due to the fact that there were only two
shallow bowls with direct rims recorded within this analysis. Neckless jars are also slightly
thinner than the other vessel types at 15 and 20 mm from the lip.
The majority of rim sherds (54%) had rounded lips (Table 9 and Figure 7.8). Flat rim
sherds comprise 28% of the total and pointed lips comprise 18% of the total rim sherds. Though
necked jars with rounded lips comprise the largest percentage of the total sherds analyzed
(Figure 7.9), rounded lips are the most common among the follow vessel forms: deep bowls,
shallow bowls, and all the necked jars. Additionally flat lips are found almost exclusively
among necked jars and deep bowls (Figure 7.11).
Incorporating the three different lip treatments with vessel types shows that everted rim
deep bowls with a rounded lip have the largest average orifice diameter (Figure 7.14). Also,
92

inverted rim neckless jars with a pointed lip have the smallest average orifice diameter. Among
all the vessel types, it seem as though average orifice diameter varies by lip treatment for each
vessel type. For sherd thickness at 2 mm from the lip, it also seems as though average orifice
diameter varies by lip treatment for each vessel type (Figure 7.15). Overall, it appears there is no
correlation between lip treatment of vessel type for both orifice diameter and rim thickness at
two millimeters from the lip.
Interestingly, the means of all the attributes examined within this data set are quite
similar (see Appendices B – G). For the most part, the differences are more or less marginal. To
ensure errors has not been made in assigning vessel type and rim profile to these rim sherds,
some of the rim sherds were reexamined. At the beginning of my analysis when the sherds were
assigned a sherd number and the appropriate attributes were recorded, the sherds were then
bagged numerically in groups of twenty-five, except for the final bag which contained 32 sherds.
From each of these bags I arbitrarily selected two sherds to reexamine the vessel form and
profile. To ensure I was not influenced by what I already recorded in my data set, I first
reassessed vessel form and rim profile for each arbitrarily selected sherd and then compared my
reexamination findings to my previously recorded data. In every case, the vessel form and rim
profile were exactly as I had originally recorded them. Therefore it can be surmised that if an
error was made in determining vessel types, then this error was consistent though out my
analysis. Additionally, it is possible that some vessel forms, likely very small bowls, were
inadvertently eliminated from this analysis due to the large number of very small sherds that
were excluded from this analysis.
As previously discussed, expectations exist for ceramic vessels correlated with sedentism
and agriculture. Among those expectations related to this thesis are that jars should be more
93

numerous in respect to bowls, that jars will be large, and also that there should be evidence of
thinner walled vessels used for cooking. Interestingly, none of these expectations were met
within this analysis. In terms of jars and bowls, the percentages are nearly equal, with 50.2% of
the sherds indicating bowl forms, and 49.8% indicating jar forms. When accounting for vessel
form and rim profile (vessel type), direct rimmed deep bowls (28.7%) comprise the largest
portion of the total sherds analyzed. However this is closely followed by direct rim necked jars
(25.7%). These vessel types are then followed by everted rim necked jars (18.3%) and everted
rim shallow bowls (12.3%). Again, bowls still account for the largest percentage of all the vessel
types, though only slightly. Though this deviates from the expectation that jars should be more
abundant than bowls, comparison of this data to an analogous Leon Plain assemblage could
provide further insight. It is possible that the ratio of jars to bowls in this Goliad ware analysis
could be greater than the ratio of jars to bowls in a comparative Leon Plain assemblage, possibly
inferring the expectation that jar creation and usage would have increased necessarily within the
mission setting.
Surprisingly, Johnson (1994) specifically describes that at least 12 vessels were likely
jars/ollas and only references a minimum of 3 bowls in his analysis (Table 1). Since this seems
to indicate more jars than bowls at this prehistoric site, this also contradicts expectations. Black
and McGraw (1985) however, suggest that six vessels are represented in their Panther Springs
Creek site assemblage, of which five are possibly bowls and only one is a jar (Table 2). This
could possibly suggest an increase in jar forms within the mission period, however only the jar
form is based on rim sherds (total sherds =124), and the remaining five assumed bowls lack rim
sherds and conclusions are based on much smaller numbers of total sherds (Table 2). In both of
Black’s (1982:447, 1986a:386) Choke Canyon reports, he notes that ollas and bowls are the most
94

common forms (Tables 3 and 4). Here an exact proportion would aid in comparison. Though
Black (1986a:386) notes that 41% were ollas and 31% were bowls (correlated with cooking and
serving), the remaining 28% are not detailed in the report, and therefore comparison is at best
tenuous.
The expectation that larger jars should exist within this Goliad ware assemblage is rather
dependent on the relative size of Leon Plain jars. Johnson (1994:188) notes that the Toyah
people at Buckhollow primarily used large simple bowls, and medium-sized jars. Unfortunately,
size descriptions can be relative and subjective however Johnson (1994) does note that Vessel
1(a bowl) had an orifice diameter of .25m (25 cm) (Table 1). He also notes that Vessel 3
(everted large jar or small olla) had an orifice diameter of .16m (16 cm) and Vessel 5 (everted
rim jar) had an orifice diameter of 55mm (5.5 cm) (Table 1). Within this Goliad rim sherd
analysis, the averages of the mean orifice diameters for everted, inverted, and direct necked jars
are 16.10 cm, 16.91 cm, and 15.07 cm, respectively (Table 7). According to the orifice diameter
and description of Johnson’s Vessel 3, the Goliad jars from this analysis, based on their averages,
would be considered large. If the Goliad jars within this analysis are the roughly the same size
as loosely implied via Johnson’s (1994) work, then the expectation that Goliad jars would be
larger than Leon Plain jars has also not been met. In comparison with Johnson’s (1994) Vessel 5
orifice diameter (5.5 cm), a number of the Goliad rim sherds in this analysis had a minimum
orifice diameter of 5 cm (sherd number’s 116, 120, and 218 for example – see Appendix A) and
therefore inferring larger Goliad jar size is not possible. Though Johnson’s (1994) orifice
diameter measurements are in line with the orifice diameters of some sherds within this analysis
(see Appendix A), Johnson’s data is clearly insufficient for statistical comparison and a more
adequate Leon Plain assemblage would be required. Likewise, Black and McGraw (1985:18995

190) describe only one vessel form as “jarlike” with orifice diameter of 9cm (Figure 8.1); this
also is insufficient for adequate statistical analysis. Unfortunately both of Black’s (1982, 1986a)
Choke Canyon Series reports lack data for orifice diameter (Tables 3 and 4).
The third expectation is that vessels should be thinner in a more sedentary and
agricultural setting as these ceramics were exposed less to mobility related stresses such as
impact shock, and are instead subject to thermal stresses during the cooking of starchy foods
introduced into the diet. Results of this analysis show that rim sherd thickness is rather
consistent across vessel types (Figure 7.4). For example, the mean of sherd thickness
measurements taken 15mm from the lip for necked jars ranges from 6.34 – 6.50 mm while deep
bowls range from 6.42 mm – 6.68 mm, and shallow bowls have a mean thickness of 6.50mm
(Table 4). It was expected that differences in vessel form might be marked by differing sherd
thickness as vessels likely served differing functions (cooking, storage, etc.), yet this is not
evidenced in the data. To infer whether Goliad ware is thinner than Leon Plain ware, a
comparison is of course necessary. Johnson (1994), Black and McGraw (1985), and Black
(1982, 1986a) all provide measurements for sherd thickness. However an accurate direct
comparison is not possible since very few of the sherds within these Leon Plain analyses are rim
sherds and most measurements were taken as averages or ranges and often along different points
of the sherds. Since vessel forms are largely assumed in these Leon Plain analyses, an overall
thickness of sherds will be used for comparison. To attempt this comparison, Johnson (1994)
notes sherd thicknesses ranging from a mean of 4.360 mm – 8.7 mm, Black and McGraw (1985)
range from 0.5 cm – 0.78 cm (5 – 7.8 mm), Black (1982) range from 0.4 cm – 0.9 cm (4 – 9 mm)
and Black (1986a) range from 0.3 cm – 0.9 cm (3 – 9 mm) (extreme measurements excluded, as
well as measurements for figurines and pipebowls – see Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively).
96

When averaging the maximum and minimum of these ranges, an approximate sherd thickness is
supposed where Johnson’s (1994) equals 6.5mm, Black and McGraw’s (1985) equals 6.4 mm,
Black (1982) equals 6.5mm, and Black (1986) equals 6.0 mm. These Leon Plain measurements
of sherd thickness are more or less equal with the mean sherd thickness determined in this thesis
(Table 4). Ulrich (2004:69) also reported a mean sherd thickness for fifteen Leon Plain sherds
(fourteen sherds from the Biesenbach site (41WN88) and one sherd from a site near Junction,
Texas (41KM69) as 6.27mm (Ulrich 2004:76). Mean rim sherd thickness for ninety-nine rim
and body sherds from the Hinojosa Site (41JW8) as reported by Black (1986b:93) was 6.1 mm.
Again, these align with the results of this analysis and therefore deviate from the expectation that
Goliad vessels should have thinner walls.
Much of the available Leon Plain ceramic data seems insufficient for direct comparison
with this Goliad ware analysis. Though the expectations for changes in performance
characteristics as evidenced though functional attributes of these ceramics were not met in this
thesis, further research is suggested to obtain a more accurate assessment. Interestingly however,
comparing this data set to previous Goliad research yields similar results. Ricklis (1999a)
discusses his examination of 230 Goliad ware rim sherds from the same location of Mission
Espíritu Santo (41GD1) and determined that bowls are represented at 55%, while jars are only
34%. Additionally Ricklis (1999a) notes an average sherd thickness of 5.99 mm, and orifice
diameters ranged from 5 – 35cm. Ricklis even states that “despite the presumably sedentary
lifeways of Natives at the mission, vessels were rather small” (1999a:140).
Ricklis (1999b) likewise examined Goliad sherds (n=111) from Presidio La Bahía
(41GD112) near the final location of Mission Espíritu Santo. Again, Ricklis’s (1999b) findings
align with the results of this thesis. Ricklis noted that of the total rim sherds (n=16), rounded lip
97

treatments were most common, followed by flat lip treatments, and then least common were
pointed lips (Ricklis 1999b:25). The findings within this thesis are the same in that 54% of the
rim sherds from this analysis were rounded, 28% were flat, and 18% were pointed (Figure 7.8).
Ricklis (1999b:25) also found that vessel orifice diameters of the Goliad rim sherds from
Presidio La Bahía (41GD112) most commonly range from 15 cm – 19cm, which also align with
the finding within this thesis (see Figure 7.3 for average orifice diameters). Regarding rim sherd
thickness, Ricklis (1999b:25) states that the average maximum thickness was 6.00 cm, which is
also similar to the findings within this thesis (see Table 4 and Figure 7.4).
Fox and Tomka (2006:124) similarly find that out of 53 rim sherds examined from
Presidio La Bahía along the Guadalupe River (41VT8), they identified shallow bowls (n=20),
deep bowls (n=17), jars (n=9), and bottles (n=6). Additionally they note an average sherd
thickness of 5.56mm stating that “although small differences between assemblages from
different missions do exist, overall the thickness patterns are quite similar” (Fox and Tomka
2006:124). Though additional research is required, the general trend seems to indicate that the
expectations of jars outnumbering bowls, of jars being large, and of decreasing vessel wall
thickness associated with an increase in sedentism and agriculture, are not represented within
these Goliad ware assemblages.
Though some basic inferences can be surmised from these comparisons, it cannot be
stressed enough that these comparisons are not ideal. An issue arose in comparing the results of
this analysis to other analyses, both Leon Plain and Goliad ware analyses. First, there is some
degree of discrepancy in terminology referring to bowls and jars. Rice (1987:209-210) refers to
this issue and it has clearly been encountered in researching for this thesis. For example, Ulrich
et al. (2005:45) mentions a straight rimmed jar. Since Rice (1987:216) notes that the presence of
98

a neck defines a jar, then the absence of a neck coupled with unrestricted access as depicted in
Ulrich et al.’s straight rimmed jar (Figure 8.2), would have been qualified in this analysis as a
direct rim deep bowl (Ulrich et al. 2005:45 Figure 4-2). As noted above, Black and McGraw
(1985:190) refer to a jarlike vessel. This jarlike Leon Plain vessel lacks a neck as depicted by
the authors (Figure 8.1) and would have been qualified as an inverted rim deep bowl within this
thesis. Similarly, Black (1982:424) refers to a straight sided vessel as a cylindrical jar (which
also lacks a neck) (Figure 8.3), which in this thesis would have been qualified as a direct rim
deep bowl. It is duly noted that exceptions do exist, as within this analysis a tecomate style
vessel is referred to as a neckless jar (see also Rice 1987:216-217). The point is that
comparisons must be very carefully considered across researchers, as universal nomenclature for
both Leon Plain and Goliad ware vessel types has yet to be rigorously defined.

Though the comparisons within this discussion are not perfect, these results should add to
the existing evidence that perhaps other selective pressures may have been influencing these
Goliad ceramics. It is clear that even though Goliad ware is described as a plain utilitarian ware,
much diversity exists within this ceramic type. Further analysis of this data set could prove
beneficial. Future research might include attempting to differentiate vessel function among the
vessel types. For example it might be beneficial to determine which jars were ollas used for
water, and which had evidence of food residue or other cooking use evidence. Additionally,
since this is a rather large data set in comparison to most Leon Plain and Goliad ware data sets,
100

perhaps even more stringent analyses could be considered; for example removing the rim sherds
with small chord widths (under 20mm) (Raymond 1999:41) or applying better definitions for
qualifying deep and shallow bowls (Ulrich et al. 2005:42).
It is quite interesting to ponder other possible reasons for this uniformity in the data. Fox
and Tomka have indicated that perhaps similar sherd thicknesses relate to a limited number of
manufacturing areas or perhaps even “underlying technological prerequisites of ceramic
manufacture” (2006:125). As related to expectations for wall thickness, Rice purports that “the
need for thick walls can be avoided by manipulating the paste composition…either through their
natural properties or by adding temper” (1987:228). Additionally Patterson discusses prehistoric
pottery in southeast Texas noting that “thickness is not a key variable in different uses of pottery
in this region, but that 6 mm is an ideal thickness for the manufacturing process and strength of
pottery” (1999:39). Patterson also states that “Bone-tempered pottery would have been a good
choice for cooking use, because bone has a low thermal expansion coefficient” (Patterson
1993:38). These statements by Rice (1987) and Patterson (1999) coupled with Fox and Tomka’s
(2006) discussion certainly warrants future investigation into Goliad sherd thickness including
paste and temper analyses.
Hood also presents an interesting point stating that a regular and predictable surplus of
food is essential in food storage as a viable subsistence strategy (Hood 2007:197). She further
notes that “Other important factors influencing storage are to what degree groups are willing to
bear the costs of preparing foods for storage and defending the stores, rather than address
shortages through sharing” (Hood 2007:197). This statement also warrants future investigation
into the expectation that the number of jars might be greater than bowls and also why the bowls
seem relatively small within the Goliad ware assemblage.
101

Crops often failed at Mission Espíritu Santo as the fields were not suitable for irrigation
and depended on rainfall (Ricklis 1999a:135, Ricklis 1999b:4, Walter 2007:20). Since the San
Antonio missions had successful irrigation, mission Espíritu Santo relied on obtaining corn from
San Antonio (Neely 1999:228, Ricklis 1999b:4). This corn was apparently either traded for beef
(Ricklis 1999b:4) or purchased (Ricklis 1999a:135). The native inhabitants were largely
dependent on the mission for rations such as cattle, tobacco, and corn (Walter 2007:21). As
further discussed by Walter, many supplies were distributed to households including “a metate, a
pot, an iron griddle, and a kettle” (2007:21) and once a week “women received rations of corn,
kept securely in the mission granary” (2007:22). Since many provisions were distributed to the
native inhabitants of the mission, including weekly distributions of corn (likely on the household
level) this would reduce the need for large storage and cooking jars.
Expectations set in the theory chapter of this thesis (see Chapter 5) derive from
prehistoric hunter gatherer groups living as independent households that were storing and
processing their own foods which required cooking and storage jars. Residing within the
mission, these native groups were still living as households however they were now dependents
relying on central food storage. Since corn and other rations were distributed on a weekly basis,
long term storage would not be needed. Furthermore, if the weekly corn rations were distributed
in ground form (corn flour), then in terms of processing, the corn would not require steeping or
simmering, and would be processed as tortillas or other such foods. The results of this analysis
suggest that the frequency of large jars did not follow expectations. Likewise, the results also
suggest that decreasing vessel thickness did not follow expectations.
In conclusion, none of the expectations for ceramics in a more sedentary and agricultural
environment were demonstrated within the results of this analysis. Furthermore, the general
102

uniformity of the Goliad Plain ceramics as evidenced in the similar means of attributes (see
Appendices B-G) is likewise intriguing. If anything, this raises more questions including what
was driving selection of these formal attributes of Goliad ware. Additional analyses such as
microscopic and petrographic studies might help not only differentiating within this assemblage
but perhaps in comparison with other assemblages as well.

VITA
Originally from Massachuestts, Sara Bodah now calls Austin, Texas her home. In the
past, Sara earned her liberal arts degree from Syracuse University. She graduated with a
Bachelor of Arts degree and dual majored in both Anthropology and Economics. At Syracuse
University, Sara participated in a historical archaeology field school at the Harriet Tubman
Home in Auburn, New York. Sara’s first field school experience spawned a continued interest in
archaeology.
After graduating from Syracuse University, Sara worked for State Street Corporation in
Boston, Massachusetts as a Portfolio Accountant. Upon moving to Austin, Texas, Sara
continued working in the banking industry in a reconciliation role for Temple Inland’s Guaranty
Bank. Deciding to follow her passion, Sara parted with accounting to pursue a Master’s degree
in Anthropology at the University of Texas at San Antonio. In addition to completion of
rewarding coursework at UTSA, Sara has both worked and volunteered many hours at UTSA’s
Center for Archaeological Research. Sara has also participated in two field schools at the
Rancho de las Cabras site, once as a student and a second time as a graduate volunteer aiding
staff in teaching the course. Sara has also volunteered during public outreach days at Rancho de
las Cabras.
Future plans include spending time with her growing family and obtaining a fulfilling job
in archaeology where she hopes to learn from and preserve the past in an effort to educate the
future.
