ABSTRACT
On behalf of CP&Y, Inc. and Travis County, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed Old San Antonio Road at Onion Creek Bridge Project
in southern Travis County, Texas. Located east of Manchaca, Texas, the project area is approximately 0.8
mile west-southwest from the Interstate Highway (IH) 35 and Onion Creek Parkway intersection. Travis
County proposes to construct a new two-lane bridge southeast of and parallel to an existing bridge at the
Old San Antonio Road and Onion Creek crossing. The extant bridge, constructed in 1915, is considered a
contributing resource to the Old Austin to San Antonio Post Road Historic District; it will remain in
place. The project involves property belonging to Travis County, a political subdivision of the state, and
is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas. SWCA conducted investigations under Antiquities Permit
Number 6921.
The project area begins approximately 0.75 mile southwest of the Old San Antonio Road and Farm-toMarket (FM) 1626 intersection and parallels the southeast side of Old San Antonio Road for approximately 1,450 feet. The project area is irregularly shaped and comprised of both existing and proposed new
right-of-way (ROW). The width of the existing ROW varies north to south from 70 feet to 80 feet, for a
total area of 2.36 acres. The proposed new ROW also has a variable width that is maximally about 160
feet at the proposed new bridge location. It is roughly crescent-shaped and tapers back to the existing
ROW at either end, for a total area of 2.24 acres. The depth of impacts has not yet been determined, but
bridge construction typically requires impacts up to 20 feet. Thus, the area of potential effects (APE) is
1,450 feet long with variable widths, for a total area of 4.6 acres.
The investigations included a background review of the project area and a surrounding 1-mile radius and
an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing and backhoe trenching of the 4.6-acre APE. The background review determined that the project area has not been previously surveyed and that no previously
recorded sites are within the project area. Sixteen sites are recorded within a 1-mile radius along with
eight previously conducted cultural resource investigations. The historic map review revealed no historicage structures within or adjacent to the APE, besides the aforementioned 1915 bridge that will remain in
place.
During the archaeological survey that was performed on July 10, 2014, SWCA archaeologists examined
the entire 4.6-acre APE. The new ROW parallels the southeast side of Old San Antonio Road, which is
adjacent to undeveloped property. Low-density residential development is adjacent to the roadway to the
north of the creek. Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed that the proposed project area is within a semi-rural setting previously impacted by vegetation removal, road construction and maintenance,
overhead utility installations, fence construction, and erosion.
SWCA’s investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey of the APE with subsurface investigations, including the excavation of five shovel tests and four backhoe trenches, which were all placed within the 2.24 acres of new ROW. This survey exceeded the Texas Historical Commission’s survey standards, which require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile of a ROW that is 100 feet wide, or in this case
five excavations. Two Isolated Finds (IFs) were documented just east of the APE and south of Onion
Creek. IF01 includes an early-stage biface fragment and a secondary chert flake. IF02 is a group of solarized (amethyst-colored) and aqua-colored glass shards. Both IFs were observed on the upland ground surface outside the limits of the APE, and in extensively disturbed areas. No other cultural resources were
encountered during the survey. SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural
resource properties within the APE. As no properties were identified that meet the criteria for designation
as a State Antiquities Landmark, according to 13 TAC 26.8, SWCA recommends no further cultural resources work within the project area.

INTRODUCTION
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed Old San Antonio Road at
Onion Creek Bridge Project in southern Travis
County. Located east of Manchaca, Texas, the
project area is approximately 0.8 mile westsouthwest from the Interstate Highway (IH)
35 and Onion Creek Parkway intersection
(Figure 1). CP&Y, Inc., on behalf of Travis
County, proposes to construct a new two-lane
bridge southeast of and parallel to an existing
bridge at the Old San Antonio Road and Onion Creek crossing.

The investigations consisted of a background
literature review and an intensive cultural resources survey with shovel testing and backhoe trenching of the proposed 4.6-acre APE.
All investigations were conducted in accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and
the standards developed by the Council of
Texas Archaeologists and adopted by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Archaeologists Ken Lawrence and Shannon Smith conducted the survey on July 10, 2014.

The existing bridge, constructed in 1915, will
remain in place. It is considered a contributing
resource to the Old Austin to San Antonio
Post Road corridor, which is part of the National Historic Trail known as The Camino
Real de Los Tejas or “Kings Highway” (St.
Clair 2014). The project involves property belonging to Travis County, a political subdivision of the state, and is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas. SWCA conducted investigations under Antiquities Permit Number
6921, with Dr. Mary Jo Galindo serving as
Principal Investigator.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The proposed APE is in a semi-rural setting
that is quickly becoming urbanized with residential subdivisions and commercial development (Figure 2). It is situated about 0.8 mile
west-southwest from the IH 35 and Onion
Creek Parkway intersection. Recent aerial
photography reveals a stock tank near the project’s southern terminus, and that Old San Antonio Road is flanked by agricultural fields or
pasture to the west, while undeveloped woodlands line the road immediately to the east,
separating the road from a residential development project southeast of the project site.
North of the creek are large-acreage residential properties adjacent to the roadway.

The project area begins approximately 0.75
mile southwest of the Old San Antonio Road
and Farm-to-Market (FM) 1626 intersection
and parallels the southeast side of Old San
Antonio Road for approximately 1,450 feet.
The project area is irregularly shaped and
comprised of both existing and proposed new
right-of-way (ROW). The width of the existing ROW varies north to south from 70 feet to
80 feet, for a total area of 2.36 acres. The proposed new ROW also has a variable width that
is maximally about 160 feet at the proposed
new bridge location. It is roughly crescentshaped and tapers back to the existing ROW at
either end, for a total area of 2.24 acres. The
depth of impacts has not yet been determined,

GEOLOGY
The underlying geology of the entire project
area is mapped as Fluviatile terrace deposits
associated with Onion Creek (Barnes 1974).
Fluviatile terrace deposits are gravel, sand,
silt, and clay in various proportions, with
gravel more prominent in the older, higher
terraces (Barnes 1974). Surrounding the project area is Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk
composed of chalk and marl (Barnes 1974).

Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys. Aerial
photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology
Maps, and the NRCS Web Soil Survey were
also examined. As part of the review, an
SWCA archaeologist also examined the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay Maps, a mapping/geographic
information system (GIS) database with historic maps and resource information covering
most portions of the state (Foster et al. 2006).

SOILS
The project area soils are mapped as 43 percent Patrick soils, 38 percent mixed alluvial
land, frequently flooded, and 19 percent Lewisville silty clay (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2014). Mixed alluvial
land soils flank the drainage crossing; the Patrick soils are located on the terrace slopes, and
the Lewisville silty clay soils are associated
with the surrounding uplands.
In order of predominance, the Patrick series, 2
to 5 percent slopes, consists of deep soil found
on nearly level to strongly sloping ancient terraces of uplands and have a typical solum
thickness of 20–30 centimeters (cm). The
mixed alluvial land series consists of very
deep soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from mixed sources. These soils occupy
smooth flood plains, stream terraces, and alluvial flats. Finally, the Lewisville silty clay
with 1 to 2 percent slopes is a deep soil that is
found on uplands with a typical solum of 6080 inches (NRCS 2014).

FIELD METHODS
SWCA’s investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations within the project area. Archaeologists examined the entire ground surface and
any erosion profiles or exposures for cultural
resources. Subsurface investigations involved
shovel testing and backhoe trenching in settings with the potential to contain buried cultural materials, dependent on variables such as
disturbances and soils. THC survey standards
require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile
of a ROW that is 100 feet wide, or five excavations for a project of this size. The matrix
from each shovel test was screened through
¼-inch mesh, and the location of each excavation was plotted using a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. Each shovel
test was recorded on a standardized form to
document the excavations.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA conducted a thorough background cultural resources literature review of the project
area. To conduct this review, an SWCA archaeologist reviewed the Oak Hill (3097-224)
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle map on the THC’s
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online
database and searched for pertinent records
pertaining to the project area. This source provided information on the nature and location
of previously conducted cultural resources
surveys, previously recorded cultural resource
sites, and the locations of National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) properties, sites designated as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs), Official Texas Historical Markers,

Backhoe trenching was also performed in areas that had the potential for deeply buried archaeological sites. Generally, trenches were
1.2–1.5 m (4 to 5 feet) deep, 7 m (23 feet) in
length, and 0.75 m (2.5 feet) wide. A total of
four backhoe trenches was excavated in the
APE, and all work was performed in accordance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (29 CFR Part 1926).
SWCA performed a non-collection survey.
Artifacts encountered were to be tabulated,

analyzed, and documented in the field, but not
collected.

41TV684, 41TV1876, and 41TV1877, which
are within a 1-mile radius of the current project area, were revisited and evaluated. Between October 2009 and January 2010,
EComm conducted an archaeological survey
for the City of Austin’s South IH-35 Water/Wastewater Program project in compliance
with the ACT under Permit Number 5881
(Butler and Feit 2010). The investigations recorded sites 41TV2369 and 41TV2370 and revisited and reassessed site 41TV1956, all of
which are within a 1-mile radius of the current
project area. The remaining six cultural resources investigations occurred between 1986
and 1989 on behalf of the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), between 1998 and
2000 on behalf of the City of Austin, and in
2001 on behalf of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) – Fort Worth District (Atlas
2014).

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review determined that the
project area has not been previously surveyed
and that no previously recorded sites are within the project area. Seventeen archaeological
sites are recorded within a 1-mile radius of the
project area along with eight previously conducted cultural resource investigations (Atlas
2014). The extant bridge that will remain in
place is considered a contributing feature to
the Old Austin to San Antonio Post Road corridor, which is part of the Camino Real de Los
Tejas National Historic Trail, and is discussed
in detail in St. Clair (2014).

Additionally, there are four cemeteries located
within a 1-mile radius of the project area. The
cemeteries include: the Live Oak Cemetery,
the McCuistion Cemetery, the Brown Cemetery, and the Chapel Hill Memorial Cemetery.
The four cemeteries have each been assigned
archaeological site trinomials 41TV1683,
41TV1682, 41TV1688, and 41TV1689, respectively; however, none of these has a formal site form filed in the Atlas and only cursory information limited to burial date ranges is
available. Burial dates encountered throughout
the cemeteries range from 1860–1900
(McCuistion and Brown cemeteries), 1900–
1945 (McCuistion, Brown, and Chapel Hill
Memorial cemeteries), 1945–1975 (Brown
cemetery), and 1975–2004 (Brown and Chapel Hill Memorial cemeteries) (Atlas 2014). No
date ranges were available for the Live Oak
Cemetery.

The closest cultural resource to the project area is archaeological site 41TV16, which is approximately 0.08 mile (425 feet) southeast of
the southern terminus of the project area,
overlooking Onion Creek on a high terrace.
Site 41TV16 is a multi-component Archaic to
Late Prehistoric-era open campsite containing
a series of burned rock middens (Atlas 2014).
Many of the burned rock middens have been
disturbed by looting activities. Preservation,
including nomination as an SAL, mapping,
filling in the looter potholes, and possibly creating a walking park with informative signage
was recommended when the site was recorded
in 1994 (Atlas 2014). Sixteen additional sites
are located within 1 mile of the project area
(Table 1; Atlas 2014).
In 2008, Ecological Communications Corporation (EComm) performed an archaeological
inventory for the Capital Metro Onion Creek
Park and Ride project in compliance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) under Permit Number 4821 (Butler 2008). During these
investigations, previously recorded sites

and 1958. No historic-age resources have been
documented within or adjacent to the project
area, according to the information depicted in
these maps (Foster et al. 2006). The 1867 map
of Texas by Helmuth Holtz illustrates an unnamed spring in the project area location, but
no road or bridge (Foster et al. 2006). The
1896 Austin USGS topographic map also depicts an unnamed spring or creek and a road
located southeast of the current project area
(Foster et al. 2006). The 1932 Travis County
map depicts Onion Creek and an unlabeled
roadway that appears to be Old San Antonio
Road based on its configuration (Foster et al.
2006). The scale of these three maps precludes
extracting more details about the project area.
The 1955 Oak Hill and 1958 Buda USGS
topographic maps depict Onion Creek and Old
San Antonio Road. No structures are illustrated immediately adjacent to the project area on
these maps; however, three structures are located just north of the project area along the
north side of Old San Antonio Road (Foster et
al. 2006).

ground surface visibility, the ground surface is
littered with limestone gravel and cobbles
with some areas of exposed limestone bedrock. Soils at the highest elevations north and
south of Onion Creek are composed of brown
to yellowish brown clay loam with high gravel
content. Soils near the creek tend to have a
higher silt content with rounded to subrounded gravel and cobbles. A total of five
shovel tests (SS01–02 and KL01–03) was excavated throughout the project area, all of
which were negative for cultural material (Table 2). Evidence of vegetation clearing was
observed throughout the property, and fallen
trees from the recent floods were noted, exposing large slabs of limestone bedrock (Figure 5). The northern- and southernmost portions of the APE have been affected by road
construction and maintenance, fence construction, and overhead utilities. Additionally, an
area adjacent to the southern portion of the
APE, south of Onion Creek has been disturbed
by recent construction activity. This area has
been cleared of vegetation and sloped, apparently for erosion control purposes (Figure 6).

FIELD SURVEY
Two Isolated Finds (IFs) were documented
just east of the APE on the uplands south of
Onion Creek. IF01 is composed of one earlystage biface fragment and one secondary chert
flake (Figure 7). The biface is composed of
grayish brown chert with very light patina and
minimal cortex. The flake is composed of very
dark grayish brown chert and exhibits no patina. IF02 is composed of amethyst and aquacolored glass shards (n=13). The historic glass
fragments appear recently broken and likely
represent only two vessels (Figure 8). Both
IFs were observed on the ground surface within the aforementioned construction area outside the limits of the APE.

On July 10, 2014 SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian and subsurface
survey of the 4.6-acre proposed bridge project
(Figure 3). Field investigations encountered a
somewhat open environment dominated by
tall grasses and weeds with a few dense clusters of hardwoods and cedar trees bordering
Onion Creek (Figure 4). Ground surface visibility throughout the survey area ranged between 0 to 50 percent, and averaged approximately 20 percent. Portions of the project area
had been previously used for agricultural or
ranching purposes, as evidenced by past vegetation removal and two-track road construction throughout the APE.

BACKHOE TRENCH RESULTS

of central Texas and the topography gently
slopes toward Onion Creek. In areas of higher

deeply buried cultural deposits. These areas
are located on terraces situated north and
south of Onion Creek between the creek bed
and the uplands. At this location, the Onion
Creek drainage is a gradually meandering
channel with a low sinuosity ratio of approximately 1.12 (Charlton 2008). The perennial
channel is roughly 12 to 15 feet wide with 1 to
2 feet of water with a limestone bedrock base.
Scattered riffles and pools are common and
the point bars contain a mixed load of sand,
gravel, subrounded limestone cobbles and a
few boulders. The drainage valley at this
crossing is composed of a stepped, paired terrace system with two alluvial landforms,
which from youngest to oldest include T0 and
T1 terraces (Waters 1995). The uplands overlooking the drainage valley are composed of
shallowly buried and exposed Upper Cretaceous bedrock of the Austin Chalk formation
(Barnes 1974). The project area begins in the
upland valley margins descends and crosses
the terraces and ends again in the upland valley margins. The T0 terraces align the waterway and are composed of deep mixed alluvial
land soils containing subrounded gravel, cobbles, and small boulders. The T1 terraces at
this crossing slightly differ between the right
bank (south side) and the left bank (north
side). Both sides have a sloping tread toward
the drainage suggesting colluvial and alluvial
parent materials, but the right bank terrace has
large areas of exposed bedrock.

clay loam with rootlets and insect burrows.
This stratum has a more friable consistency
with an abrupt and irregular lower boundary.
The third horizon is generally a brown to yellowish-brown (10YR5/3 to 10YR5/4) clay
loam with 40 percent pebbles, 30 percent
gravel, and 7 percent cobbles.
Two additional backhoe trenches (BHT03–04)
were excavated on the T1 terrace north of Onion Creek, on the left bank of the drainage.
These trenches contained a surface horizon of
dark grayish-brown (10YR4/2) silty clay loam
with roots/rootlets and insect burrows. The
depth of this surface horizon varies from 29–
62 cmbs with the deeper deposits observed
closer to Onion Creek. Underlying the surface
horizon is a thin stratum of brown (10YR4/3)
silty clay loam with sub-rounded pebbles (50
percent), gravel (40 percent), and cobbles (5
percent). The thickness of this gravel lens varies from 6–29 cm. The third stratum observed
consists of brown (10YR5/3) silty clay loam.
The final stratum consists of yellowish-brown
(10YR5/4) silty clay loam exceeding 160
cmbs.
The deposits on the right bank in BHT01 and
BHT02 most closely correlate with the Patrick
soils mapped for this area. These deposits are
described as soils derived from clayey and
gravelly sediments on ancient terraces of uplands (NRCS 2014). The left bank deposits in
BHT03 and BHT04 most resemble the frequently flooded Oakalla silt loam. These are
described as soils from loamy alluvium eroding from Cretaceous limestone (NRCS 2014).
Generally, the terraces crossed by the proposed project appear to be too dynamic to
contain intact cultural deposits. The left bank
on the north side of Onion Creek seems to
have a slightly less dynamic stratigraphy. Regardless, no cultural resources were observed
in the backhoe trench excavations.

A total of four backhoe trenches (BHT01–04)
was excavated in the APE (Table 3). BHT01
and BHT02 were excavated on the T1 terrace
south of Onion Creek, on the right bank of the
drainage. These trenches contained a surface
horizon of brown (10YR4/2) silt loam with
roots/rootlets and insect burrows with an abrupt and smooth lower boundary. This horizon
appears to have been compressed, perhaps
from recent construction activities. Underlying
the surface horizon around 40 cm below surface (cmbs) is a stratum of brown (10YR4/2)

that will remain in place. That bridge is considered a contributing feature to the Old Austin to San Antonio Post Road corridor, which
is part of the Camino Real de Los Tejas National Historic Trail.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of CP&Y, Inc. and Travis County,
SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed Old San Antonio Road at Onion Creek Bridge Project in
southern Travis County, Texas. Located east
of Manchaca, Texas, the project area is approximately 0.8 mile west-southwest from the
IH 35 and Onion Creek Parkway intersection.
CP&Y, Inc., on behalf of Travis County, proposes to construct a new two-lane bridge
southeast of and parallel to an existing historic
bridge at the Old San Antonio Road and Onion Creek crossing. The project involves property belonging to Travis County, a political
subdivision of the state; therefore, SWCA
conducted investigations under Antiquities
Permit Number 6921, with Dr. Mary Jo
Galindo serving as the Principal Investigator.

All of the excavations were all placed within
the 2.24 acres of new ROW, based on the extent of prior disturbances within the existing
ROW. This survey exceeded the THC survey
standards, which require a minimum of 16
shovel tests per mile of a ROW that is 100 feet
wide, or in this case five excavations. In general, the project area has been heavily impacted by prior vegetation clearing, overhead utility installations, road construction and maintenance, and erosion. The natural setting and
disturbances within the survey area have reduced the potential for encountering intact
cultural resources, as impacts have altered the
surface and subsurface setting and landscape.

The project area begins approximately 0.75
mile southwest of the Old San Antonio Road
and FM 1626 intersection and parallels the
southeast side of Old San Antonio Road for
approximately 1,450 feet. It is irregularly
shaped and comprised of both existing and
proposed new ROW. The existing ROW is
2.36 acres, while the proposed new ROW totals 2.24 acres. The depth of impacts has not
yet been determined, but bridge construction
typically requires impacts up to 20 feet. Thus,
the APE is 1,450 feet long with variable
widths and a total area of 4.6 acres.

Two IFs were documented adjacent to, but not
within, the APE and south of Onion Creek.
IF01 includes an early-stage biface fragment
and a secondary chert flake. IF02 is a collection of glass shards. Both IFs were observed
on the upland ground surface outside the limits of the APE, and in extensively disturbed
areas. No other cultural resources were encountered on the surface of the APE or in any
subsurface investigation during the survey.
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith
effort to identify cultural resource properties
within the APE. As no properties were identified that meet the criteria for designation as a
State Antiquities Landmark, according to 13
TAC 26.8, SWCA recommends no further
cultural resources work within the project area.

The investigations included a background review of the project area and an intensive pedestrian survey, including the excavation of
five shovel tests and four backhoe trenches.
The background review determined that the
project area had not been previously surveyed.
Additionally, there were no previously recorded archaeological sites within the bounds of
the APE. A review of historic maps of the project area determined that no historic-age structures are located within or adjacent to the
