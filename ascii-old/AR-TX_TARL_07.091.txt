Abstract
During March, 1986, the Texas Archeological Survey conducted
archeological investigations at the Gruy Ranch - 78 Prospect, northern
Jim Hogg County, Texas, for Everest Minerals Corporation of Corpus
Christi. Intensive survey of the 1000 acre project area and 2.5 mi les
of pipeline right-of-way, resulted in the identification of four
prehistoric sites,
the series 41JH14 through 41JH17,
and
re-investigation of prehistoric site, 41DV12.
No other cultural
materials were noted, except modern trash which was not recorded as a
site.
None of the sites are felt to be eligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places due to the nature of the
materials present, as wei I as post-occupational
disturbances.
However, data gathered during recording and on-site analysis expand
existing knowledge concerning local prehistory. Results of prevIous
and current investigations are used to discuss prehistoric cultural
affi liation and apparent settlement.

INTRODUCTION
Between March 17 and 23, 1986, Steven Kotter and Deborah Smith
from the Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at
Austin, conducted an archeological survey and assessment at the Gruy
Ranch
7B Prospect, Jim Hogg County, Texas.
Everest Minerals
Corporation of Corpus Christi, Texas, has proposed in situ mining of
uranium which requires a permit issued by the Texas Department of
Michael
Health and reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission.
Buckley is the environmental coordinator for Everest Minerals.
The proposed project area is located approximately three miles
northwest of the town of Hebbronvi I Ie, in north central Jim Hogg
County, Texas (Fig. 1). The area is along the northern edge of the
triangle formed by highways 16 and 359 East and the Duval County line
on land owned by the Gruy Ranch and 7B Cattle Company.
The project
consists of a 1000 acre, rectangular permit area and 2.5 mi les of 400
foot wide pipeline right-of-way.
Within the permit area is an
irregularly shaped direct impact area where dri II holes and extraction
facilities wil I be located. The proposed pipeline wi I I connect these
faci lities and an existing line located east of Highway 16.
Fol lowing sections of the report first describe the project
environment and provide cultural background information.
Survey
methods and results are then described, prior to a discussion of site
assessments and recommendations.
Final sections of the report are
interpretive and project summaries.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Jim Hogg County occupies the central portion of the South Texas
Plain as defined by Chambers (1948) which includes land south of a
line drawn from Del Rio, east to San Antonio and then southeast to
near Corpus Christi. The northern portion of the Plain is drained by
the Nueces River which has its headwaters along the southern boundary
of the Edwards Plateau in West Texas, flowing south and then east
before emptying into Corpus Christi Bay. South of the Nueces River,
drainage watersheds are entirely within the South Texas Plain and
become increasingly tenuous. Los Olmos Creek in southern Duval County
is the southernmost stream with a coastal outlet. Major streams
flowing through Jim Hogg County which include Palo Blanco Creek, are
lost beneath the sand sheets nearer the coast.
The number of
playa-I ike depressions increases as one moves south of the Nueces
River, as drainage development decreases.
Sti I I further south,
surface streams are absent to the Rio Grande. The headwaters of Rio
Grande tributaries in Zapata and Webb counties are between 20 and 25
mi les distant from the Hebbronvi I Ie area.
Topography
The project area is characterized by gently rol ling terrain
(Fig. 2) with a maximum difference in elevation of approximately 30.5
meters (100 feet). -rhe central and southwestern portions of the
permit area are dominated by high rises (Fig. 3a) located along the
crest of the stream divide between Mesquite and Nariacitas creeks;
tributaries of Palo Blanco Creek. Broad flat saddles separate rises
six meters (20 feet) in height that were littered with broken
limestone rocks.
Upland rises also tend to occur just above the
val ley margin of Mesquite Creek, although the rise within the current
right-of-way is relatively low. Between the two series of rises are
gentle slopes (Fig. 3b) which include remaining portions of the permit
area. Where opposite slopes converge, such as in the northeast corner
of the permit area, topographic lows and large depressions may occur.
The val ley margin of Mesquite Creek generally coincides with the
crests of the upland rises previously described. However, a broad
shelf below the rise at the western end of the right-of-way is clearly
distinct from the more steeply sloping val ley wal I below it. The
presence of a large depression immediately south of the project area
suggests that an upland physiography characterizes this area since
area depressions are not known in val ley wal I situations.

val ley slope crossed by the right-of-way (Fig. 4a) is gentle,
recessive near its base and covered by gravels. -rhe left valley slope
to the eastern end of the right-of-way is free of gravels and
initially steeper than the right. However, development of a major
creek tributary has created a low ridge-like stream divide near the
eastern end of the right-of-way, the crest of which is generally flat.
The right-of-way crosses Mesquite Creek at a point just above the
confluence of a minor tributary (Fig. 4b). The right bank is high
(approximately 6 meters or 20 feet) and the bank slope relatively
steep.
The divide between the creek and the tributary is low, gently
sloping and covered with gravels. Tributary development is minimal.
Geo logy and Soi Is
Surface geologic units in the Hebbronvi 1Ie area include the
Pliocene age Goliad Formation, recent windblown deposits and alluvium
(Barnes 1976). The Gol iad Formation is a complex unit composed of
clay, sand, sandstone, marl, caliche, limestone and conglomerate
exposed over the entire right-of-way and half the permit area.
Fragments of hard limestone or cal iche cap upland rises and appear to
be remnants of more resistant strata within this formation.
Gravels
are present in small quantities. Windblown sands, which form isolated
patches west of the primary expanse of coastal sand sheets, occupy the
central half of the permit area. Minor deposits of both Pleistocene
(primari Iy remnant gravel bars) and Holocene alluvium occur along
Mesquite Creek.
Area soi Is are complex, but consist mostly of moderately deep
fine sand loams and loamy fine sands of the Delmita and related soil
associations (Sanders and others 1974). Indurated white caliche is
the prominent subsoi I buried up to 75 centimeters (30 inches) below
the ground surface. Specific soi I associations form small, irregular
patches which do not conform to the distribution of described geologic
units.
Biota
Jim Hogg County is included within the Mesquite - Chaparral
Savanna (Arbingast and others 1976) that is characterized by large
areas of brush, small trees and cactus. Shrub species present include
mesquite, varieties of acacia, mimosa, granjeno, cenizo, white brush,
prickly pear and tasaji I 10, which reflect the semi-arid megathermal
climate. Except for the crests of upland rises where mixed scrublands
occur, vegetation within the project area has been extensively
modified for pasturage.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The project area is within a portion of the South Texas cultural
region defined by Hester (1975) as characterized by a savannah
(interior) adaptive strategy. Archaic manifestations are numerous,
diverse and localized in nature, but share a number of traits and
traditions. More specific statements concerning the relationship
between the Hebbronvi lie area and other portions of South Texas are
limited by the absence of intervening investigations.
Summaries are
avai lable from Choke Canyon Reservoir along the Nueces River (Hal I,
Black and Graves 1982; Hester, Hall and Black 1986), the Rio Grande
near
Falcon Reservoir (summarized by Kotter 1980), Rio Grande
tributaries in Starr and Zapata counties (Nunley and Hester 1975) and
near coastal portions of Hidalgo, Wi I lacy and Cameron counties
(Mallouf, Baskin and Ki I len 1977; Prewitt 1974; Day, Laurens-Day and
Prewitt 1981).
Ethnohistoric Record
Ethnohistoric data for the Hebbronvil Ie area
includes a
description of the Arbados Indians visited by Cabeza de Vaca (Campbel I
and Campbell 1981:37-40).
The Arbados were living in a single
settlement at the margins of intermittent streams during late spring
and early summer. The settlement consisted of mat covered huts of
unknown construction that were apparently moved when the group
relocated. The dense thorny vegetation provided little food, and much
of the group effort was spent in extensive gathering. Water was also
scarce. Food items mentioned include the meat of unspecified animals,
prickly pear pads, both green and ripe tunas and two kinds of seeds.
The Arbados utilized local prickly pear stands, and did not travel to
the lower Nueces River area. Food preparation consisted of broi ling
meat and baking of green tunas and prickly pear pads in a pit oven.
The use of bows and arrows, nets and hide-scraping tools were noted.
The Cuchendados, a culturally and linguistically simi lar group, were
observed by Cabeza de Vaca nearer the Rio Grande.
Previous Investigations

within Jim Hogg County and only eight sites within Duval County had
been recorded. The initial intensive survey in the Hebbronvi lie area

8

(Prewitt and Nance 1980) is immediately north of the current project
area in Duval County, whi Ie the second (Kotter 1981) is south of the
project nearer Hebbronvi I Ie. None of the sites identified have been
tested or excavated.
A few sma I ler surveys have been conducted but
reports are unavailable at this time.
The seven prehistoric sites identified within the McBryde Lease
(Prewitt and Nance 1980) occur in three distinct locations. Cultural
materials noted at two stream terrace sites, 41DV11 and 41DV12,
consisted primarily of chipping debris, although possible surface
collecting by the landowners was noted. A disturbed hearth at 41DV12
suggested generalized camping activities, confirmed by the current
survey. More varied cultural materials, including tools and burned
caliche nodules, were observed at four sites at the valley margin and
a single site near an upland depression.
On the basis of these
results, Prewitt suggested that local subsistence was based on
extensive use of upland areas, with sites at the valley margin
representing collection stations characterized by intensive tool use
but only limited camping activity.
Investigations at the Silverlake Permit Area (Kotter 1981)
provided a greater sample of areas adjacent to Mesquite Creek, that
complimented known data concerning settlement.
Four of the five
prehistoric sites identified near the creek contained high percentages
of burned rocks, evidence of intensive camp maintenance activities.
The quantity of burned rocks and sparsity of tools contrasted markedly
with val ley margin sites documented by Prewitt.
One of
the
intensively
used campsites surrounded a large depression.
The
remaining site near the creek evidenced the limited use of lithic
gravels.
Three prehistoric sites located at the val ley margins some
distance from the creek were smaller and lacked tools, although
limited quantities of burned rocks were observed at two.
Area Summary
Data gathered during the previous investigations suggested that a
single settlement model, based. on avai lable ethnographic information
might subsume the majority of cultural variability noted in the
Hebbronvi I Ie area.
As stated, the model includes the following
elements: 1) extensive gathering in upland areas which left little or
no evidence in the form of identifiable sites; 2) collection stations
located at the val ley margin where prickly pear and other food items
were initially processed, and limited camp maintenance activities were
required; and 3) habitation sites along the creek where the bulk of
camp maintenance activities were conducted, and prickly pear pads and
green tunas were processed for consumption.
The only artifactual
evidence of the age of area occupations are two triangular dart points
classified by Prewitt within the Matamoros type dated to the Archaic
Period.

9

As part of the preparation of this report of investigations data
from each known area site were reviewed, in order to more clearly
define types of sites. Three types of campsites and three types of
lithic scatters, summarized in Table 1, are recognized on the basis of
the presence and quantity of burned rocks, lithic tools and kinds of
flaking debitage.
Within this framework Type 1 campsites are viewed
as primary habitation areas;
Type 2 represent intensive activity
areas, where camp maintenance was an imbedded activity; and Type 3
the result of more I imited activity.
The separation of lithic
scatters fol lows simi lar reasoning, Type 1 being the location of
intensive activity not requiring camp maintenance; Type 2 the result
of more I imited activity;
and Type 3 areas of lithic resource
procurement. Use of the terms quantifying the various criteria
defining types of sites is relative to the Hebbronvi I Ie area, where
occupation in general was less intensive than in developed river
basins to the north (Nueces) and south (Rio Grande).

METHODS
Inventory and assessment of cultural resources within the Gruy
Ranch - 7B Prospect was accomplished by intensive pedestrian survey of
the permit area and pipeline right-of-way. The 120 meter (400 feet)
wide right-of-way was covered in two transects by two persons spaced
approximately 25 meters apart. The transects paralleled the county
road which provided orientation. and a means of estimating transect
intervals. Within the Permit Area, transects were perpendicular to
the road and oriented south using a compass. Survey strategy was
modified by increasing the transect interval to 50 meters, and by
intensively examining specific topographic features including rIses,
crests, saddles and depressions.
The systematic survey was fol lowed
by
delineation and
documentation of identified site areas. The initial task at each site
was an intensive examination of the ground surface, during which al I
cultural
materials observed were flagged.
A single 26 by 25
centimeter screened shovel test was excavated at areas with soil in
order to define site stratigraphy and the nature of buried cultural
materials. At site 41JH17 where surficial remains were sparse, more
intensive shovel testing was used to help locate and define this area.
At the end of the initial phase of site investigation, it was apparent
that the cultural materials were primarily surficial, few in number
and disturbed by land clearing and erosion.
Although none of the sites appear eligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places, information obtained at the
survey level could significantly augment current data concerning local
settlement.
An on-site analysis was therefore implemented which
involved description of all observed surficial cultural materials.
The analysis al lows comparisons between sites based on the total
number of items present and the relative abundance of specific
categories of materials. In addition, certain potentially diagnostic
artifacts were collected for more in depth study.
Other site
documentation consists of completed State of Texas survey forms and
both black and white print and color slide photographs.
A Daily
Journal was maintained which summarized survey methods and results.
AI I documentation and collected artifacts are curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.

RESULTS
During the current survey, one previously recorded prehistoric
site, 41DV12, was reinvestigated, and four prehistoric sites, the
series 41JH14 through 41JH17, were identified. Two prehistoric sites,
41JH11 and 41JH14, located within the McBryde Lease (Prewitt and Nance
1980) apparently do not extend into the current project area as
suggested by this earl ier survey. A scatter of obviously modern trash
was noted, but was not recorded as a site.
Current results are
summarized in fol lowing sections which describe each site investigated
and the cultural materials collected. Results of testing and on-site
analysis are presented in tables 2 and 3, respectively.

Site Descriptions
41DV12
Setting: Site 41DV12 is located along the high right bank of
Mesquite Creek near the confluence of a minor tributary. A low narrow
rise separates the base of the val ley slope and the currently eroded
bank.
Vegetation consists of a mowed mesquite grassland, except
adjacent to the creek where scattered large acacia trees grow.
Summary of Investigations: Work consisted of on-site analysis of
124 surficial cultural materials, excavation of a single shovel test
and written and photographic documentation.
Description: The site consists of burned rocks, lithic tools and
debitage primarily exposed by erosion on the steep bank slope
(Fig. Sa). Total site dimensions are 270 by 75 meters, or an area of
13,500 square meters, although width is only 15 meters in the portion
currently investigated. At least in this area, the site may conform
to the low rise which paral leis the bank (Fig. 5b), half of which has
been lost to erosion. Above the bank, sparse cultural materials are
buried up to 30 centimeters below the ground surface in compacted fine
sandy loam. Use of the site for habitation and/or intensive food
processing is indicated by abundant burned rocks. Lithic tools are
relatively abundant and varied, and include a projectile point, two
gouges, a bifacial chopper or crusher and utilized flakes. On-site

manufacture of bifacial gouges is apparently indicated by a single
manufacturing failure. The relative sparsity of tested cobbles, cores
and cortical debitage compared to interior debitage is evidence of the
final stages of tool production. The stemmed dart point collected
(see p. 31) is untyped, but is tentatively dated to the Late Archaic
Period.
Assessment: The information yield potential of this campsite,
which might have been sufficient to warrant additional work if intact,
has been greatly reduced by post-occupational erosion. "rhe remaining
portion of the site is small in size, thinly distributed and disturbed
by land clearing and rodent burrowing.
Recommendations:
Site 41DV12 does not appear eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Placement of
the proposed pipeline in this area wil I not affect significant
cultural resources.
4IJH14
Setting: Site 41JH14 is located along the left bank of Mesquite
Creek above the confluence of a minor tributary. Creek banks are
generally high and steeply sloping, but tributary development has
created a low divide adjacent to the creek in this area. Gravels
underlying surface soi Is are exposed at the tip of the divide and
along the lower slope near the creek. Sparse grasses and annuals grow
on site.
Summary of Investigations:
Work conducted at the site was
I imited to on-site analysis, which involved flagging and description
of 48 surficial cultural materials, and written and photographic
documentation.
Description: The site consists of lithic debitage scattered over
an area 75 by 15 meters, or 1,125 square meters in size, and defined
by concentrations of exposed gravels.
Cultural
materials are
apparently
entirely surficial
in nature, and indicate lithic
procurement and initial processing of tools.
Tested cobbles, cores
and cortical flake debitage are wei I represented, with two tool
manufacturing failures and a hammerstone also noted.
One tool
fai lure, and possibly several of the cores, is a Stage 1 Biface. The
second failure is distinctive, and is similar to unifacially worked
cobbles described from the Falcon area where gouges were the end
product of tool manufacture. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were
observed.

Recommendations: Site 41JH14 does not appear to be eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Placement of
the proposed pipeline in this area will not affect significant
cultural resources.
4IJH15
Setting: Site 41JH15 is located in an area of lithic gravels
exposed within the upper, right valley wal I of Mesquite Creek. The
main site area (A) is approximately equidistant from either the creek
or upland depression associated with site 41JH16. Remaining site
areas are nearer the depression.
Vegetation consists of mowed
scrubland composed primari Iy of mesquite.
Summary of Investigations: Work was limited to on-site analysis
of 94 surficial cultural materials and written and photographic
documentation.
Description: The site is actually three discrete scatters of
cultural materials grouped together on the basis of shared situation,
nature of exposure and condition (Fig. 6a).
Area A consists of
dispersed features and lithic artifacts scattered over the surface of
an area 80 by 50 meters, or 4,000 square meters, in size.
The
apparent hearths (Fig. 6b) which consist of loose clusters of between
3 and 4 burned quartzite and other rocks, are evidence of camp
maintenance activities.
The single tool observed is a projecti Ie
point. The presence of al I types of debitage from tested cobbles to
interior flakes indicates on-site procurement, initial reduction and
completion of I ithic tools. However, tool manufacturing fai lures are
limited to a single Stage 3 Biface.
The triangular dart point
collected appears to date to the Late Archaic Period.
Area B is a sma I I, surficial lithic scatter located between areas
A and (, and may be associated with either of these areas or site
41JH16. A core and cortical flake debitage are thinly distributed
over an area 25 by 20 meters, or 500 square meters, in size.
Distinctive cultural materials are limited to four quartzite flakes,
one of which has been trimmed and uti lized. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts were noted.

meters, or 2,100 square meters in size, cultural materials are too
disturbed to even approximate the original size and configuration. No
tools or other distinctive cultural materials were observed.

Assessment: The number and nature of cultural materials indicate
a very low to moderate information yield potential. Materials are
more numerous and varied in Area A which has the greatest potential of
the three areas.
However, the absence of buried cultural materials
and disturbance due to land clearing activities I imit the usefulness
of additional investigations.
Recommendations:
Site 41JH15 does not appear eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Placement of
the proposed pipeline in this area wi II not affect significant
cultural resources.
41JH16
Setting: Site 41JH16 is situated on the crest of a low rise
adjacent to a large depression (Fig. 7a) located at the right upland
margin of Mesquite Creek. Cultural materials are concentrated at the
crest edge not facing the depression, but water available there may
have been a determining factor in site location.
Vegetation is
moderately dense grasses.
Summary of Investigations: Work consisted of on-site analysis of
58 cultural materials, excavation of a single shovel test and written
and photographic documentation.
Description: The site consists of burned rocks, lithic tools and
debitage which form a discrete scatter 70 by 40 meters, or 2,800
square meters, in size. Buried cultural materials are present to 20
centimeters below ground surface, but are concentrated in the upper
five centimeters of loose sand. Burned rocks are relatively sparse
and only
limited camp maintenance activities are apparently
represented. Bifacial tools noted, which include a projecti Ie point
and small knife, are relatively abundant. The sparsity of tested
cobbles, cores and cortical debitage compared to interior debitage is
evidence of final tool reduction.
The triangular point collected
appears to be within the size range suitable for use with bow and
arrow, but is tentatively dated either to the Late Archaic or Late
Prehistoric periods.
Assessment:
Information yield potential is limited by the
sparsity of cultural materials, although distinctive artifacts are
present, and by disturbances resulting from land clearing activities.
Recommendations:
Site 41JH16 does not appear eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Placement of
the pipeline in this area will not affect significant cultural
resources.

Setting: Site 41JH17 surrounds a large depression located at a
topographic low between two series of upland rises (Fig. 7b), one at
the crest of the divide between Nariacitas and Mesquite creeks and one
at the margin of the Mesquite Creek valley. Slight rises north and
south of the depression separate low areas of drainage inflow from the
east and west.
Vegetation consists of moderately dense grasses and
several large mesquite trees which border the existing pond.

Artifact Descriptions
Triangular Projecti Ie Points
Two of the three projecti Ie points collected during the current
survey share a triangular outline, but are otherwise very different.
The larger specimen, from site 41JH15 (Fig.8a) is 42mm in length, 20mm
in maximum width and 7mm in thickness, and appears to be a dart point.
Edges are sl ightly convex and the base sl ightly concave. The central
portion of either surface has been thinned from the base, whi Ie edges
have been pressure flaked to a steep angle, but are unbeveled.
Material is gray banded, coarse grained chert. The point most closely
resembles the Matamoros type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:215), but is longer
and unbeveled.
Two Matamoros points from the McBryde Lease (Prewitt
and Nance 1980:21-24) are shorter and sl ightly beveled. The specimen
from site 41JH15 is simi lar to Triangular forms 8 and 14 from the
Falcon Reservoir area (Kotter 1980:142, 146).

The projecti Ie from site 41JH16 (Fig. 8b) is a sma I I equilateral
triangle with very steep alternate bevel ing. Edge and base dimensions
of 26mm appear to place the specimen in the size range suitable for
use as an arrow point. Basal thinning is pronounced and subsequently
the thickest portion (7mm) is near the tip.
Material is a fine
grained opaque tan chert. The point is simi lar to Triangular form 4
from the Falcon Reservoir area (Kotter 1980:137-140);
one of four
small varieties of the Matamoros type recognized.
Stemmed Dart Point
The single stemmed dart point (Fig. 8c) observed during the
current project is from site 41DV12 and is 50mm in length, 18mm in
maximum width and 7mm in maximum thickness. Blade edges are slightly
convex, and neither beveled nor serrated. Shoulders are weak and
unbarbed. The base is roughly rectangular in shape, being 12mm in
both length and width. Material is fine grained petrified wood and
mostly light brown in color, but partially a reddish brown.
Although
untyped, the point appears to be within the broad Late Archaic
tradition, characterized by small dart points with narrow, relatively
thick blades.
Gouges
Both gouges, or distally beveled tools, recovered are from site
41DV12 and share a sub-triangular outline. The larger of the two
(Fig. 8d) is 67mm in length, 45mm in maximum width and 17mm in maximum
thickness.
Cross section is plano-convex and the tool may be made
from a large flake. The bit end is slightly convex, 39mm in length,
14mm in thickness and beveled to a 55 degree angle. The entire dorsal
surface and the edges of the ventral surface have been thinned by hard
hammer flaking. The tool is made of a black, medium grained material,
local to the area, but of unknown type or origin.
The sma I ler of the two gouges (Fig. 8e) is 57mm In length, 38mm
in maximum width and 14mm in maximum thickness. Tool manufacture
involved trimming the proximal end of a large flake to provide a
working surface, and thinning of both surfaces.
The bit end is
strongly convex, 25mm in length, 9mm in thickness and beveled to a 55
degree angle. Material is medium grained, speckled brown chert which
is apparently local. The tool is similar to Bifacial Gouge form 5
from Falcon Reservoir (Kotter 1980:96).

22

Other Bifacial Tools
Other bifaces collected include a sma I I knife from site 41JH16
and a chopper or crusher from site 41DV12. 'rhe former (Fig. 8f) is
41mm in length, 21mm in maximum width and 9mm in maximum thickness.
The tool is roughly lanceolate in outline, with a protuberance along
one edge which frustrated complete thinning of the artifact. The edge
opposite the protuberance has been smoothed, apparently by use as a
knife. Material is a medium grained tan chert.
The chopper or crusher consists of a whole spherical cobble, half
of which has been bifacial Iy worked to produce an edge. Cortex was
left on the remaining half so that the tool could be safely hand held

maximum thickness is 59mm. The edge is no longer sharp, but has been
dul led and broken by use to a marked degreej a pattern of wear
consistent with use as a crusher. Material is a coarse grained gray
chert, and the specimen has been burned.
Tool Manufacturing Failure
An apparent unifacial tool fai lure (Fig. 9) was collected from
site 41JH14, which is 88mm in length, 65mm in maximum width and 27mm
in maximum thickness. The ventral surface is covered by cortex.
The
dorsal surface has been thinned both ventrally from the bit end and
along both lateral edges. Material is medium grained tan chert.
The
fai lure is simi lar to specimens observed in the Falcon Reservoir area
(Kotter 1980:83-86).

INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY
The following sections summarize current survey results within a
framework provided by previous area and regional investigations.
Occupations represented by identified sites are defined, and the
cultural materials present at different types of sites at different
locations are compared.
Age and cultural affiliation of local
occupations are then discussed within a regional context. The final
section describes apparent prehistoric settlement in the Hebbronvil Ie
area.
Summary of Occupations
Seven discrete site areas - 41DV12, 41JH14, 41JH15A, 41JH15B,
41JH15C, 41JH16 and 41~IH17
are used to summarize the nature of
prehistoric occupations within the project area.
Of these, four
41DV12, 41JH15A, 41JH15C and 41JH16
appear to represent the
locations of primary group activity and two - 41JH14 and 41JH15B ­
areas of specific activity associated with these sites. The nature of
site 41JH17 is largely undefined. Total cultural materials present at
each area vary between 15 and 124 or 0.016 and 0.055 items per square
meter. Although these values do not include buried materials, testing
results confirm the limited nature of area occupations. Sites are
sma I I, generally varying between 500 and 4,000 square meters in area,
and boundaries are generally discrete.
On the basis of site size and material density,
project
occupations appear non-intensive and non-repeating. At most, a single
episode or series of related episodes are apparently represented.
Although only a single diagnostic artifact has been recovered from any
one site, the apparent distribution of these artifacts could be the
result of the vagaries of surface collecting. Terrace site 41DV12,
the largest and most prolific of the sites investigated, is a possible
exception.
However, differentiation of distinct core and peripheral
areas at this site suggest a single occupation.
The presence of
multiple component sites may be indicated by site 41JH4, further
downstream, where a meter of cultural deposits are exposed in a stream
bank (Kotter 1981).

sites 41DV12 and 41JH16 (Fig. 10) contrast different types of

graph to the left, appear to indicate the importance of camp
maintenance activities relative to lithic processing. Camping of
longer duration and/or more intensive food prepration are apparently
represented.
Low values at Type 2 campsite 41JH16 skew the graph to
the right, although numbers of flake debitage are similar at both
sites.
Lithic processing was apparently more important at site
41JH16, at least compared to the duration and/or intensity of camp
maintenance.
Lithic tools are relatively abundant at both sites, but more
numerous and varied at 41DV12, where use of projectile points,
bifacial gouges, crushers and flake scrapers was documented.
Lithic
tools at 41JH16 are limited to two bifacial tools, a projectile point
and sma I I bifacial knife. Both duration of occupation (and therefore
the potential for discard) and/or size and composition of the group
represented (and therefore the number and variety of tools used) may
have affected tool distribution at these campsites. The relative
abundance of the various debitage categories is similar at both sites
and may characterize campsites away from lithic sources. The low
number of tested cobbles and cores and abundance of interior flakes
indicates that lithic materials were procured and initially processed
at other locations, with processing at campsites 41DV12 and 41JH16
limited primari Iy to final tool production.
However, few tool
manufacturing failures were observed.
The distribution of cultural material at areas A and C of 41JH15,
campsites distant from water but nearer I ithic sources, are shown in
Figure 11. Area C is classified as a Type 3 campsite, despite the
high percentage of burned rocks, due to the overall sparsity of
remains. Too few materials were noted at Area C to al low comparisons
beyond the basic simi larity with Area A, due primarily to their
location at a lithic source. The high percentage of burned rocks
present at Area A indicates that the intensity of camp maintenance
activities is within the range of Type 1 campsite 41DV12 near Mesquite

materials are significantly different. Tools are much fewer in number
and are limited to a bifacially worked projectile point. Higher
values for tested cobbles, cores and cortical debitage reflect the
procurement of material and all phases of tool reduction.
Lithic scatters identified include single examples of Type 2,
41JH15B, and Type 3, 41JH14 (Fig. 12). The cultural materials at the
latter site are evidence primari Iy of general procurement at an area
of concentrated gravels, but also indicate minor initial reduction of
tools. Site 41JH158 occurs in an area of scattered gravels, and is of

Age and Cultural Affi I iation
Discussion of age and cultural affi I iation of prehistoric
occupations in the Hebbronvil Ie area must consider three different
possibilities. Groups which used this area may be related to inland
groups of South Texas concentrated within the Nueces River Basin.
Increasing use of the river noted during both Middle and Late Archaic
periods may have resulted in expansion into marginal areas to the
south, most notably Los Olmos Creek, but also the Palo Blanco system.
The second possibi lity also concerns Los Olmos Creek, but as 8 part of
a coastal adaptation centered at Baffin Bay. Interior areas possibly
as far west as Hebbronvil Ie, could have comprised the fall/winter
phase of the annual cycle of coastal groups.
The third possibil ity
envisions use of upland areas by groups based along the Rio Grande as
part of seasonal scheduling. Groups moving up Rio Grande tributaries
might gather over an area which included the Mesquite Creek Basin.
The age and cultural affi liation of local sites cannot be defined
with any degree of certainty since investigations have been limited to
surface surveys and few potentially diagnostic artifacts have been
recovered.
However, it may be worthwhile to review known data in the
light of current results which provide possible evidence of
affil iation with the Rio Grande area, but also suggest interaction
with other areas. At the present, there is no evidence of coastal
interaction and major comparisons are between Choke Canyon Reservoir
(Hall, Black and Graves 1982; Hester, Hal I and Black 1986) along the
Nueces River and Falcon Reservoir (Kotter 1980) along the Rio Grande.
Ethnohistoric record: Groups described as living nearer the Rio
Grande were culturally and linguistically simi lar to the Arbados,
living in the Hebbronville area.
Triangular Dart Points: Triangular shaped points are shared by
both the Nueces and Rio Grande systems, but morphological and temporal
variabi lity has only begun to be defined.
At the present time,
triangular points in the Hebbronville area provide only a broad
cultural affi liation and general time of occupation, namely the Middle
and Late Archaic periods.
Small Triangular Points:
The sma I I, equilateral,
strongly
beveled point collected from 41JH16 is similar to specimens from the
Falcon Reservoir area, where they were assumed to be late in time.
This apparent Matamoros variant has not been identified along the
Nueces River.
Gouges: Gouge shaped lithic tools, like triangular projecti les,
are common to the entire South Texas region. Clear Fork tools have a
widespread distribution in North America, and an earlY--Context.
The
majority of gouges from the Choke Canyon area, and presumably Falcon
Reservoir as wei I, occur in an Archaic context.

30

Diminutive Gouges: Sma I I distally beveled tools common during
the Middle Archaic Period at Choke Canyon Reservoir are apparently
absent from Falcon Reservoir. Prewitt recovered small gouges from
north of the project area (Prewitt and Nance 1980:24-25) which are
similar but not identical to these distinctive tools.
If present
within the Hebbronville area, diminutive gouges would provide a
significant soc io-temporaI marker.
Sma I I Sifacial Tool:
The small biface with edge smoothing
collected from 41JH16 appears, on the basis of size only, to be closer
to the Nueces River tradition of diminutive tools.
Unifacial Tool Failure: The apparent unifacial gouge fai lure
collected from 41JH14 is simi lar to specimens from the Falcon
Reservoir area. Tools were reduced by flaking one surface of a whole
cobble, and not a split cobble as at Choke Canyon.
Lithic Materials: The petrified wood used to make the stemmed
dart point from 41DV12 is not local, although the source is uncertain.
At least palmwood occurs along the Rio Grande, but the nearest
concentration of similar wood is the Colorado River drainage.
Although a very tenuous association at best, split cobble technology
was introduced into Fayette County from an apparent South Texas source
during the Late Archaic (Kotter n.d.).
Prehistoric Settlement
Prehistoric settlement is determined by group scheduling and
composition as well as the unequal distribution of a number of
different resource needs. The initial task of any settlement model is
to define the avai lable resource base, which in the Hebbronvil Ie area
has a relatively simple and uniform distribution.
The absence of
marked differences in elevation, slope and soils limit the variabi lity
of both plant communities and animal habitats. The abundance and size
of plant species may change with avai lable moisture and other
requirements, but variation is on the same basic theme.
A means of
defining prehistoric use of different physiographic zones is provided
by the locations of water and lithic gravels which covary with
topography.
Results of current and previous investigations suggest real and
significant differences in the intensity of occupation of near-creek
and val ley margin locations. Previously developed models note the
coincidence of water and lithic resources at habitation sites near
major creeks and the need for collection sites at val ley margins to
explain concentration of activities in these areas. If a single
subsistence system was operating, resources gathered over extensive
upland areas would be collected and initially processed at sites at

31

the val ley margin, before being taken to near-creek habitation sites
for final processing and consumption. Prior to the current survey
I ithic gravels had only been observed at near-creek locations, and the
complexity
in
settlement
which
arises from dispersed gravel
concentration was not present. Assemblages of sites located at the
val ley margin which contained abundant extractive tools and limited
burned rocks were within expectations for hypothesized collection
sites.
Use of large depressions at both near-creek and upland
locations had been documented.
Investigations within the Gruy Ranch - 7B Prospect provide new
data which expand, but not necessari Iy contradict, this basic model.
Although site locations conform to the model, apparent function and
activities of sites at the val ley margin do not. The identification
of a habitation site at the val ley margin associated with lithic
gravels, in particular, was not expected. In order to more fully
understand the results of the current project, al I known area sites
were classified by type (Table 4) and the location of each type
relative to physiography was quantified (Table 5). The locations of
sites within the current project are shown graphically in Figure 13.

cultural materials at 41JH17 suggests that large depressions located
on stream divides were part of this dispersed, upland subsistence
pattern.
Use here contrasts with more intensive use of large
depressions at near-creek and valley margin locations. The absence of
sites on upland slopes is not surprising, but upland saddles were felt
to have some site potential. "rhe broad, rock free saddles provide
good views of both upland and stream environments.
Settlement nearer Mesquite Creek is more complex and involves
different
kinds of
sites with
varied cultural diagnostics.
Disregarding for the moment apparent affiliation or period
of
occupation, the major variables bel ieved to affect the locations of
sites within the current project are the unequal distribution of water
and lithic gravels.
This is not true at the McBryde Lease where
gravels are absent and only one site is near a water source.
In al I
areas, Mesquite Creek is the primary source of both water and
concentrated gravels. Within the current project, both of these
necessary resources are also present at the val ley margin, but their
locations do not coincide.
Although in close proximity, seasonal
water was available from the depression located at the upland margin;
whi Ie gravels occur on the upper valley slope. Under the simplest set
of expectations which might arise from this distribution of resources,
Type 1 campsites should be located at creek water sources with
gravels, secondari Iy at other water sources and not at gravel
concentrations some distance from water.
Data summarized in the proceeding section comparing the kinds of
cultural materials present show a number of inconsistencies with these
expectations. Only Type 1 campsite 41DV12, and associated lithic
scatter 41JH14, near Mesquite Creek conform completely. The presence
of a Type 2 campsite near a depression at the val ley margin is
consistent with results at the McBryde Lease (Prewitt and Nance 1980),
but site 41JH16 is sma I ler and more discrete than the extensive light
scatters observed by Prewitt. Sti II more anomalous is the presence of
Type 1 campsite 41JH15A at the upper val ley wal I some distance from

this area, but apparent site function for habitation is at complete
variance with the existing settlement model.
Two possible explanations may account for
the observed
variability.
First, the presence of both water and lithic gravels,
not noted at the McBryde Lease, may have made the valley margin as
attractive as near-creek locations.
However, if this was so, site
41JH15A would probably be located nearer the upland depression, rather
than at the downslope end of the gravel concentration nearer the
creek. The other possible explanation is that sites 41JH15A and
41 ..IH16 are part of a different settlement system, or systems,
independent of the previously defined model, and represent temporary
habitation sites of non-local groups present in the Hebbronville area

PROJECT SUMMARY ,
Intensive survey of the Gruy Ranch - 78 Prospect and associated
pipeline
right-of-way
resulted in the re-investigation of one
prehistoric site and identification of four prehistoric sites,
summarized in Table 6. Due to the sparsity and surficial nature of
cultural materials present and prevalence of land clearing activities,
none of the sites meets criteria for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places. The proposed construction in the Gruy
Ranch
78 Prospect wi I I, therefore, not impact significant cultural
resources.
