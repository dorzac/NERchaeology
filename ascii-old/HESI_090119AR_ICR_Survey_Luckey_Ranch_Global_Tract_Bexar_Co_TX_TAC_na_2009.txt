MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Starting 28 September 2009, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted
an intensive 4-day cultural resources survey of the 610.8-acre Luckey Ranch Global tract
(Project Area), located west of San Antonio in western Bexar County, Texas. Luckey Ranch
Global, LP (LRG) is proposing to develop the Project Area as a residential subdivision.
Although the proposed development is privately owned and privately funded, LRG is seeking to
develop the Project Area in compliance with the City of San Antonio’s Master Plan, which
includes the protection of cultural resources. As such, LRG contracted with Horizon to perform
a cultural resources survey of the Project Area. The purpose of the survey was to determine if
any archeological sites were located within the boundaries of the Project Area and, if so, to
determine their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The intensive cultural resources survey within the 610.8-acre Project Area did not
identify any archeological sites within the property boundaries. The low occurrence of isolated
artifacts, coupled with the thorough modification of the Project Area into agricultural fields during
modern times, has prompted Horizon to recommend that archeological clearance be granted for
the entire 610.8-acre tract.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the 610.8acre Luckey Ranch Global tract (Project Area), located west of San Antonio in western Bexar
County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). Luckey Ranch Global, LP (LRG) is proposing to develop the
Project Area as a residential subdivision. Although the proposed development is privately
owned and privately funded, LRG is seeking to develop the Project Area in compliance with the
City of San Antonio’s Master Plan, which includes the protection of cultural resources. As such,
LRG has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to perform a cultural
resources survey of the Project Area. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the boundaries of the Project Area and, if so, to
determine their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Reymundo Chapa served as the project’s Principal Investigator. He and Jared Wiersema
(Horizon field technician) conducted the field investigations between 28 September and 1
October 2009.
The cultural resources survey consisted of both intensive surface inspection and shovel
testing efforts. Although the modern cultivation of fields on the Project Area makes it more
difficult to assess the intact contexts of possible cultural resources, it also has caused a variety
of subsurface artifacts to be more easily identified on the ground. Therefore, the bulk of the
investigation consisted of surface inspection. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 3 acres for projects of this size;
therefore, a total of 204 shovel tests were required over the 610.8-acre Project Area in order to
meet the minimum survey standards. Horizon met the TSMASS by producing 204 shovel tests
over the Project Area.
The intensive cultural resources survey within the Project Area resulted in the location of
5 isolated artifacts that included a biface fragment, a large probable core, and 3 flakes that were

scattered across different quadrants of the Project Area, with no clusters of artifacts observed
that would constitute documentation as a formal archeological site. No cultural features, burned
rock, or organic remains were observed in the Project Area. Aside from the previously
mentioned isolated artifacts, no other cultural resources were identified or documented within
the Project Area. If a strong concentration of cultural materials had been present, they likely
would have been identified strictly by chance, given the constant disturbance of soils by
intensive plowing.
Based on the documentation of only a handful of isolated artifacts on the Project Area, it
is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the Project Area will have no adverse impact on
significant cultural resources. Furthermore, plow zone disturbance over the shallow rocky soils
within the Project Area diminishes any real potential of finding intact buried, stratified cultural
deposits. Thus, Horizon recommends that no further investigations are warranted on the
Project Area and that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking. However, in
the unlikely event that cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the
THC and the City of San Antonio should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Project Area is located just outside San Antonio, approximately 2.4 kilometers (km)
(1.5 miles) west of the Loop 1604/US Highway 90 interchange (see Figures 1 and 2). It can be
found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Macdona and Culebra Hill, Texas,
topographic quadrangles (USGS 1991, 1993) (see Figure 1). Silva (2009) reports that the area
is known as the Donut Hole—a phrase coined by Dallas-based developer Chip Field, who has
been a developer in this area of the city since 2004. Field calls it the Donut Hole because there
is a large demographic demand but limited supply of available land. In other words, all the
desirable land is boxed in by various barriers to development on all sides. Plans for the Project
Area call for upwards of 2,000 single-family homes, as well as commercial development (Silva
2009). On-site photographs are provided in Figures 3 through 7.

2.2

CURRENT LAND USE

LRG has indicated that the entire Project Area once functioned as an extensive cattle
feed lot. To facilitate this, the entire area has been heavily terraced, providing steeply stairstepped plateaus over an area that was likely once a hillside that sloped down to Potranco
Creek to the east (Figure 3). In addition to the surface modifications, it appears that
considerable amounts of soil were also placed across the resulting terraces. Currently, the
entire Project Area is divided into 17 terraced agricultural fields (see Figure 2) on which corn
and cotton are being cultivated. Apart from the terraced fields, developments on the Project
Area include 3 large holding ponds—that seem to provide water for field irrigation (Figure 7)—
and a series of roads that lead to the compartmented fields. In the northeastern sector of the
Project Area, roads are lined on both sides by rows of pecan trees (Figure 6). The Project Area
is a working farm that includes farming equipment and non-portable structures (barns and living
quarters). Although these structures are associated with the Project Area’s present function,
they all fall outside the of the current property boundaries.

2.3

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is situated between 2 hills to the west and east. Surface elevation
ranges from approximately 700 feet above mean sea level (amsl) in the west to 650 feet amsl

along the eastern perimeter of the Project Area (USGS 1991, 1993), which also is defined by
Potranco Creek. Although the natural terrain within the Project Area would normally slope
gently from west to east, the changes in elevation within the Project Area seem more abrupt
given the artificial terracing of fields (see Figure 3), an alteration that purportedly took place
during the 1940s. The fields seem to have been constructed so as to take advantage of the
down-flow of water from higher fields onto lower ones.

2.4

SOILS

Field investigation of the Project Area revealed a richer, non-native, organic top-soil.
This dark brown clay loam constitutes the most superficial layer of every field within the Project
Area. During the course of the survey, farmers working the Project Area indicated that the
terraced fields were constructed in the 1940s, so soil was probably imported during the same
period. Depths for this superficial layer range from 15 to 65 centimeters below surface (cmbs),
but they generally average between 20 and 30 cmbs over most of the Project Area. The nonnative soil contains a variety of stones (Figure 8) including chert, limestone, and a variety of
shell fossils (Figure 9).
Apart from the soil described above, a total of 10 naturally occurring soils are mapped
within the Project Area and are presented in Table 1 and on the map in Figure 10 (NRCS 2009).

VEGETATION

Vegetation on the Project Area is sparse due to the agricultural function of the land.
Trees and shrubs are limited to the area in and around the 3 artificial holding ponds. Pecan
trees grow liberally around the farm buildings and seem to have been deliberately planted along
the roads in the northeastern sector of the Project Area (see Figure 6). Vegetation along fence
lines and around the 3 holding ponds is typical of the Texas Hill County, consisting primarily of
scattered mesquite, cedar, yaupon, agarita, prickly pear, and short grasses (see Figure 4).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located near the southern boundary of Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central
Texas Archeological Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas generally
practiced a nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout prehistory. In contrast to much
of North America, mobility and settlement patterns in this region do not appear to have changed
much through time.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World now can be confidently extended to at
least 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989), and evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that
humans were present in Eastern North America as early as 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990). More recent discoveries at Monte Verde, Chile, provide unequivocal evidence for human
occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer et al.
1997). However, most archeologists discount claims of human occupation earlier than the
Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
Generally, the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) constitutes the earliest evidence
for human activities in Central Texas (Collins 1995). This period coincided with ameliorating
climatic conditions that followed the Pleistocene epoch, a period that saw the extinction of
mammoth, camel, and some types of bison and horse. Distinctive projectile points, which are
relatively large, often fluted, and lanceolate in shape, characterize different cultures within this
long period. The points are usually distinguished by a certain type of tool set, which includes
spurred end scrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndians likely were organized into
egalitarian bands that consisted of a few dozen individuals who lived a nomadic lifestyle, and
their subsistence patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal
remains because floral materials do not preserve well. PaleoIndians exploited plants, small
animals, fish, and shellfish; there is little evidence that they hunted the now extinct megafauna,
as is documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, PaleoIndians practiced a broad-based
subsistence throughout prehistory. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian period is divided into
2 separate periods that are based on the recognizable differences between distinctive projectile
point styles. The Early PaleoIndian period is characterized by large, fluted projectile points (i.e.,
Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period is

HJN 090119 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and
Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). Although this climatic trend marks the beginning of a
significant reorientation of lifestyles throughout most of North America, the change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily on a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. However, generalized hunting and
gathering characterize most of prehistory, and the appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the
development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of
projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural period. Material culture shows greater diversity
during this time, especially in the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late, with changes
in projectile point morphology holding as the differentiating factor. Other changes in material
culture occurred. For instance, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic and
continue into the Late Archaic, and large cemeteries begin to be used during the Late Archaic.
Prehistoric sites become more plentiful through time, which often is considered evidence of
population growth. However, differential preservation accounts (at least in part) for the lower
number registered older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The appearance of the bow and arrow defines the onset of the Late Prehistoric period
(1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995). Pottery also appears in Central Texas during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Although the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear continue to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along
with the bow and arrow, the rest of Texas stops using it during the Late Prehistoric period
(Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, small prismatic blade technology appear to be
associated with unifacial arrow points. The Late Prehistoric period is divided into the Austin and
Toyah phases. Austin phase sites first occur in the north, which leads some researchers (e.g.,
Prewitt 1985) to suggest that Central Texas, Austin-phase populations migrated from the north
into southern areas. Finally, Indians of the Toyah developed a ceramic industry.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P.

TO PRESENT)

Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern Gulf of Mexico in 1519, which marks the first
incursion of Europeans in to what is now Texas. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed South
Texas after being shipwrecked on the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay. However, European
settlements did not disturb native populations until after 1700. During the first half of the
18th century, the fur trade and the mission system, along with epidemic diseases, began to
seriously disrupt native cultures. The effects of contact are clearly evidenced at the Mitchell
Ridge site. Burial data suggest that populations declined and groups merged (Ricklis 1994),

14

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 610.8-acre Luckey Ranch Global Tract, Bexar County,
Texas

and Native American populations began to participate more heavily in the fur trade. By the time
Anglo-Americans increased their settlement of Texas in the early 1800s, indigenous Indian
populations were in sharp decline.
In 1691, Domingo Terán de los Ríos and Fray Damián Massanet led the first European
expedition that explored the Bexar County region; evidently, they reached the San Antonio
River, near where the San Juan Capistrano Mission was later founded. 1 Nearby, they found a
group of Payaya Indians living on the riverbank. Massanet recorded in his diary that the Indians
called the place Yanaguana. He later renamed the site San Antonio de Padua to celebrate the
memorial day of St. Anthony, which occurs on June 13. Franciscan fathers Antonio de San
Buenaventura y Olivares and Isidro Félix de Espinosa and a military officer named Pedro de
Aguirre led the next Spanish expedition, but they did not reach the area until April, 1709. They
were impressed by the setting and the availability of water, and they noted that the area might
make a promising site for future settlement. In 1714, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis crossed the
region on his way to San Juan Bautista. Espinosa, who first visited the region in 1709, revisited
San Antonio in 1716 while traveling to East Texas with the Domingo Ramón expedition. This
time he recommended San Pedro Springs as a mission site. Near that spot, Martín de Alarcón
led the expedition that founded the San Antonio de Valero Mission and San Antonio de Béxar
(or Béjar) Presidio in May 1718, which he named for Viceroy Balthasar Manuel de Zúñiga y
Guzmán Sotomayor y Sarmiento, who was the second son of the duke of Bexar. By winter’s
end in 1718, numerous Indians of the Jamrame, Payaya, and Pamaya groups had joined the
mission. In 1720, Fray Antonio Margil de Jesús founded the San José y San Miguel de Aguayo
Mission, a short distance to the south. The San Francisco Xavier de Naxara Mission was
established in 1722, but it proved unsuccessful and was merged with San Antonio de Valero in
1726. In 1724, the San Antonio de Valero mission compound, which had originally been located
at the site of the present-day Chapel of Miracles south of San Pedro Springs, was moved to
Alamo Plaza. In 1731, after the removal of the missions from East Texas, 3 additional
missions—Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña, San Francisco de la Espada,
and San Juan Capistrano—were founded along the San Antonio River.
During the 1720s, the area’s Spanish population numbered about 200. It included
53 soldiers and their families and 4 civilians with their families. On 9 March 1731, 55 Canary
Islanders arrived at Bexar, and the villa of San Fernando de Béxar became the first municipality
in the Spanish province of Texas. Together with the presidio and the villa of San Fernando the
5 missions constituted the most important Spanish concentration in Texas. By the mid-1730s
the total population of the area was approximately 900, including 300 Spanish and 600 Indian
converts. An epidemic in 1738 and 1739 devastated the missions, killing perhaps three-fourths
of the Indian population. Only 182 of 837 baptized Indians survived at Mission San Antonio de
Valero. By 1740, however, populations at the missions began to recover. Converts living in the

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

5 missions reached more than 500, many of whom were indigenous Coahuilatecan peoples
fleeing the Apaches and Comanches.
The missions developed as self-supporting communities, each ringed with farmland
irrigated by a comprehensive system of acequias, or irrigation ditches. Crops included grain,
cotton, flax, beans, sugarcane, and vegetables. Each of the missions also maintained sizable
herds of cattle, sheep, and goats, which were located on extensive ranchlands located around
Bexar. In 1809 Governor Manuel M. de Salcedo wrote that Mission Concepción's ranch
consisted of some 38 square miles and extended east and northeast from the mission to Cibolo
Creek. An inventory in 1756 recorded that the Concepción ranch had 700 cattle, 1,800 sheep,
and large herds of goats and horses.
Both the missions and the villa of Bexar were subject to sporadic attacks by Apaches
and Comanches, and nearly a quarter of the Spanish who died between 1718 and 1731 were
reportedly victims of Apache attacks. A truce was signed with the Apaches in August 1749, but
occasional attacks by Comanches and Apaches continued well into the 19th century.
In 1772, the government offices of Spanish Texas were moved from Los Adaes to
Bexar, and some east Texas settlers also moved. Nevertheless, Bexar remained a small
frontier outpost. In the late 1770s Father Juan A. Morfi reported “fifty-nine houses of stone and
mud, seventy-nine of wood, all poorly built without a preconceived plan. The whole town,” he
continued, “resembles a poor village rather than the capital of a province.”
After the secularization of the missions in 1793 and 1794, the communities around Bexar
gradually became satellite civilian communities under Bexar’s authority. Mission lands were
distributed to the few remaining Indians and the increasing number of Spanish settlers. Most of
the coveted land close to settled areas was controlled by the town's elite, which was made up of
the descendants of the original Canary Islanders and presidial soldiers. The complex network
of irrigation systems that had been operated by the missions was partially abandoned, and, by
1815, the amount of irrigated farmland had declined markedly.
Despite the downturn brought on by the secularization of the Spanish missions, San
Antonio de Béxar continued to be an overwhelmingly agricultural community. Subsistence
farming was the rule. The largest number of cultivators worked small family plots, though many
farms were also worked by tenant farmers or day laborers. The elite landowners increased the
size of their holdings after the secularization of the missions, and some of the largest ranchers
exported horses and cattle to Coahuila or Louisiana.
During the late Colonial period, Bexar continued to serve as the capital of the province of
Texas and as the main shipping point for supplies heading from Mexico to Nacogdoches and La
Bahía. Between 1811 and 1813, the city was the center of revolutionary activity against
Spanish rule. In 1811, a former militia captain, Juan Bautista de Las Casas, who was following
the lead of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla in Mexico, mounted an insurrection in Bexar that quickly
spread throughout the province of Texas. Las Casas led a band of poor, disgruntled soldiers
and civilians who resented Spanish elite rule. They scored early successes, arresting the
governor and his military staff and seizing the property of the most ardent royalists. But on 1

16

Texas

March 1811, conservative military officers and clergy supported by the isleños (aristocratic
decedents of the original Canary Island settlers) staged a counterrevolution. Las Casas was
captured in Chihuahua and executed. In an attempt to dissuade others from taking up his
cause, his head was salted and shipped in a box to Bexar for display in the Military Plaza.
Leadership of the insurrectionists fell to Bernardo Gutiérrez de Lara after Las Casas was
executed. He led an army of Mexican revolutionaries and sympathetic Americans from
Louisiana who seized San Antonio in the spring of 1813 and proclaimed Texas an independent
state. In August, however, royalist forces commanded by José Joaquín Arredondo succeeded
in routing the insurrectionists and restoring order. Arredondo's victory was followed by a period
of reprisals that included confiscation, detentions, and executions; in San Antonio alone, 327
supporters of the rebellion were shot by royalists.
In the wake of the rebellion, the population of Bexar and the surrounding region fell
markedly and did not begin to grow again until the end of the decade. By 1820, however, Bexar
had some 2,000 inhabitants, with slightly more females (1,021) than males (973); several
hundred more lived on ranches in the outlying countryside. During the 1830s, the population
again increased slightly, although the number of inhabitants in Bexar declined as more town
dwellers moved to adjoining farms and ranches.
Soon after the first Anglo-American colonists came to Texas in 1821, San Antonio
became the western outpost of settlement. In 1824, Texas and Coahuila were united into
1 state with the capital at Saltillo; a Department of Bexar was created with a political chief
overseeing the portion of the state that would become Texas. During the late 1820s and early
1830s, an increased number of North American settlers began to move to San Antonio, though
the city remained predominantly Mexican at the beginning of the Texas Revolution.
In late October 1835, Texas volunteers laid siege to the city, which was garrisoned by
the Mexican army under Martín Perfecto de Cos. On 10 December, after fierce hand-to-hand
fighting, it was occupied by Texan forces. Antonio López de Santa Anna led government forces
that retook San Antonio during the battle of the Alamo (23 February to 6 March 1836). After
Santa Anna’s forces were defeated in the battle of San Jacinto, San Antonio was re-occupied by
Texan forces. But the area, which was claimed by both sides, continued to be fought over. In
March 1842, 6 years after Texas independence, Mexican general Rafael Vásquez briefly
occupied San Antonio, and, in September of the same year, Adrián Woll led another Mexican
invasion force that seized the city.
Because of the uncertainty posed by frequent invasions, San Antonio and its
surrounding areas became largely depopulated. Many settlers fled during the Runaway Scrape
of 1836 or during subsequent attacks. They did not return in large numbers until after Texas
joined the Union. As late as 1844, San Antonio only had 1,000 residents, nine-tenths of whom
were Mexican descents.
The newly formed Bexar County covered much of the western edge of settlement in
Texas. During the late Mexican period, Texas was divided into 4 departments, with the
department of Bexar stretching from the Rio Grande to the Panhandle, as far west as El Paso.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Once Texas won its independence, the departments became counties, and on December 20,
1836, Bexar County was established, with San Antonio as county seat. Since 1860, when the
partitioning of Bexar County began, the original county has been subdivided into 128 counties.
Due in part to the large number of immigrants from the Old South and from Germany,
Bexar County’s population increased in the late 1840s. Despite this steady growth the county
remained a sparsely populated region during the state’s early years. In 1850, the county had a
total population of 5,633; 3,488 of these people lived in San Antonio. The economy was still
based on ranching and subsistence agriculture during this time, much like subsistence patterns
during the Spanish and Mexican periods, and farms remained small. On the eve of the Civil
War only 1 farm in the county was larger than 1,000 acres and most were smaller than
50 acres. Trade between San Antonio and Mexico and New Orleans was the main source of
revenue for the county, and a number of German and Anglo immigrant merchants opened
businesses in the city. But there was little in the way of industry. In 1860, the county had only
28 manufacturing establishments that collectively employed 135 employees.
In contrast to other parts of Texas, slaves played only a minor role in the Bexar County
economy. In 1850, there were only 419 African Americans living in the county, 30 of whom
were free. By 1860, the slave population had grown to 1,395, slightly less than 10% of the
county's total population. Most of the county’s 294 slaveholders owned 5 or fewer slaves, and
only 2 owned more than 40.
Because of its large German population, Bexar County was a center for antislavery
sentiment. Even so, county residents voted 827 to 709 for secession (54% for, 46% against).
On 16 February 1861, General David E. Twiggs, who commanded the federal Department of
Texas headquartered in San Antonio, surrendered all United States forces, arms, and
equipment to a committee of local secessionists backed by a large force of Texas Rangers
under the command of Major Benjamin McCulloch. Although Bexar County escaped destruction
that ravaged other parts of the South, the war years were difficult for the county's citizens, who
were forced to deal with the decrease in markets and wild fluctuations in Confederate currency.
With many of the men away fighting, the county and the surrounding region experienced an
upsurge of cattle rustling and other crimes. “Necktie parties” were organized by vigilante
committees to handle bandits, cattle thieves, and Union sympathizers.
San Antonio was occupied by Union soldiers after the war, but the county was spared
much of the political violence that consumed other parts of Texas. However, the war and its
aftermath seriously affected the county’s economy. Land prices fell significantly—by as much
as half—and most of the county’s businesses suffered. Many of the county’s farms also fell idle.
Improved farmland declined by more than 60% (from 13,697 to 5,546 acres) between 1860 and
1870. With little tax money coming in, San Antonio and county officials were unable to fund
many services, including public sanitation. As a result, the county experienced a serious
cholera outbreak in 1866.
San Antonio continued to be a commercial and military center, but the rest of the county
remained sparsely settled and undeveloped. Most of the population continued to be
concentrated in the San Antonio River valley with a few small settlements in the northern,

Texas

eastern, and western parts of the county. Economic recovery began in the late 1860s and early
1870s with the start of the great cattle drives. Bexar County became an important center for the
ranching industry because it was located at the northern apex of the diamond-shaped area
considered the Texas cattle kingdom. By 1870, the number of beef cattle in the county reached
55,325, nearly doubling the figures from 1860. A sharp increase in the price of wool, along with
the large amount of free rangeland to the west and south of the city, spurred the development of
sheep ranching, particularly between 1870 and 1880.
However, the economic recovery found its most important stimulus when the first
railroad—the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway—arrived in San Antonio in
February 1877. The completion of the rail link with the coast made the shipment of local
products easier and helped fuel a rapid growth in population. The number of inhabitants in the
county, which grew less than 2,000 between 1860 and 1870, nearly doubled over the next
decade; it increased from 16,043 in 1870 to 30,470 in 1880. Many of the new residents were
recent immigrants from Europe and Mexico. Of the total population in 1880, 7,912 were foreignborn, with the largest numbers coming from Mexico (3,498), Germany (2,621), Ireland (471),
England (334), and France (293). After the Civil War, the county’s black population also grew
dramatically as many freed slaves settled in and around San Antonio. By 1880, the number of
African-Americans in San Antonio reached 3,867, nearly 3 times what it had been in 1860.
In 1881, a second railroad called the International-Great Northern reached the city from
the northeast. The completion of the 2 railroads brought prosperity and changed the physical
face of the county. Before the 1870s, most visitors had been struck by San Antonio environs.
Despite relatively large numbers of English, Irish, and Germans, San Antonio resembled a
Mexican community more than an American one. The influx of new settlers and manufactured
building products gradually transformed the city and county into one that more closely
resembled other communities in Texas.
By 1890 San Antonio’s German population
outnumbered Mexicans who were born in Mexico (4,039 to 3,561, respectively).
The construction of the railroads also contributed in the founding of new communities,
including Macdona, Von Ormy, Cassin, Atascosa, Thelma, Beckman, Luxello, Converse, and
Kirby, though the overwhelming majority of county inhabitants still lived in San Antonio.
New industries also were established during the 1880s. By 1887, San Antonio listed
3 bookbinderies, 4 breweries, 3 carriage factories, 4 ice factories, 3 tanneries, 1 wool-scouring
plant, and an iron foundry among its businesses. Between 1880 and 1890, manufacturing
employees in the county grew from 362 to 2,518. After the turn of the century, the
manufacturing sector continued to show impressive growth. By 1920, the county had
328 factories employing 6,860 persons.
The depression hit Bexar County hard, even with its relatively diverse economy. By the
mid-1930s, many people were out of work. They were glad when New Deal programs gave
them work paving streets and building bridges, sewers, and parks. Among the largest projects
of the period were the renovation of La Villita and the San Antonio missions, and the
construction of the Paseo del Rio along the San Antonio River in the center of the city.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

During World War II, Bexar County’s large military presence grew even larger as the
area’s bases became an important center for the US Army, which trained air corps cadets under
the auspices of the San Antonio Aviation Cadet Center. During the height of the war more than
21,000 civilian war workers were employed at Kelly Field alone. The presence of military
personnel continued to bring changes to the county, even after the war. Thousands of returning
soldiers enrolled in local colleges and universities, and many others, attracted by the area
during their service years, moved to the city. San Antonio became a major retirement center for
military families, who were drawn by the relatively low cost of living and access to the premier
medical care offered by Wilford Hall and Brooke Army Medical Center. Since the end of the
Second World War, San Antonio’s economy has depended strongly on federal payrolls that
come from various military bases and research facilities, and from the large number of retired
military residents.
San Antonio became an important military center beginning in the second half of the
19th century. The San Antonio Arsenal was opened in 1858, and, in 1878, the city deeded
90 acres to the federal government for what eventually became Fort Sam Houston. During
World War I, Kelly Field and Brooks Field, which later became Kelly Air Force Base and Brooks
Air Force Base, were developed as centers for training pilots. The US Army also opened Camp
Bullis and Camp Travis to train soldiers. At the end of the war, a part of Kelly Field became
Duncan Field, and in 1931, Randolph Field was established as a primary flight training base.
During World War II, Kelly Air Force Base integrated Duncan Field, and Camp Normoyle, a
motor base, was added.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted online via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas indicates the presence of 5 previously recorded archeological sites
within a 1.6-km (1.0-mile) radius of the Project Area (THC 2009). Three of these sites are
located along the bluff immediately to the east of the Project Area (Figure 11). Site 41BX1633
is a prehistoric lithic scatter situated east of Potranca Creek with an approximated area of 60 by
75 meters. Cultural material found at the site consisted of a sparse scatter of debitage, 3 early
stage bifaces, and multiple tested cobbles and cores. Site 41BX1634 is a sparse prehistoric
lithic scatter of lithic debitage, 2 early stage bifaces, and multiple tested cobbles. And site
41BX1272 is a light-density surface lithic scatter. The 2 remaining sites are situated northeast
of the Project Area, just north of US Highway 90 (Figure 12). Both sites (41BX774 and
41BX1711) are Early to Late Archaic lithic procurement sites that produced chert nodules,
flakes, cobbles, cores, and initial stage bifaces.
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and alluvial terraces
near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the presence of the Potranco Creek along
the eastern boundary of the Project Area, and in conjunction with the number of previously
recorded sites in the general vicinity, it was considered probable that prehistoric cultural
resources existed within the Project Area. However, because of the heavy terracing that
happened during the 1940s, much of those resources and their contexts may never be
recovered. Additionally, in the unlikely event that some cultural resources are identified, it would
be difficult to distinguish between which artifacts and activities are native to the area and which
were recently relocated as a result of intensive field modification by recent farming practices.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

Horizon’s 2-person archeological field crew was able to recognize the unique topography
of the Project Area during its initial investigation, which took place 28 September 2009. The
topographical aspects greatly affected the way the crew conducted its study within the Project
Area. First, the entire Project Area has been heavily terraced to create steeply stair-stepped
plateaus across the tract to facilitate its use as a cattle feed lot. Considerable amounts on nonnative soil have also been placed over the Project Area to aid in the creation of the leveled
terraces. The western portion of the Project Area, which also is the highest point in elevation,
holds a large artificial pond that is used to irrigate the series of descending terraced fields. Two
additional ponds (aligned roughly north-south) are constructed towards the middle of the Project
Area. Presumably, these second-tier ponds are used to irrigate the lower elevation fields—
those closest to the western boundary of the Project Area. Second, these fields have been
continuously cultivated subsequent to the use of the area as a feed lot, so very little is left of the
landscape that may have once played host to prehistoric activities. Much of that landscape now
has been buried under non-native soils that typify the entire surface area of the Project Area.
Taken together, these factors obviated a strict full-coverage survey. Instead, the crew opted for
an opportunistic approach that took into consideration land use from historical to current times,
as well as the probable erosion and taphonomic processes that moved cultural resources within
and between existing fields.
The crew concluded that if artifacts were to be found, then they likely would follow
general rules established by precedence governing sites in other parts of North America. For
instance, prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Given such postulates, Horizon concentrated
its efforts along the western boundary of the Project Area (which constitutes the area of highest
elevation), and along the eastern limits of the Project Area (which essentially is the west bank of
Potranco Creek). Horizon surmised that if concentrated cultural resources were present they
would be identified with a high probability in these specific areas.
With these considerations in mind, Horizon’s crew divided the Project Area into
manageable sectors. Because the entire Project Area is already separated into agricultural
fields, the crew used these as fundamental units to begin a methodological and systematic
study of the area. Fields were labeled using letters that ultimately correspond to shovel tests
(Figure 13). The survey took place from 29 September to 1 October 2009, and was
accomplished by walking expedient transects over the extent of the Project Area. The main

objective was the intensive inspection of the surface, with shovel tests serving to confirm the
depth and makeup of non-native soils. Thus, in order to maximize the possibility of finding
cultural resources, the fields that lie in the middle of the Project Area were not shovel tested.
Although the surface of every field was visually surveyed, only areas along the eastern and
western portions of the tract were shovel tested. The TSMASS require a minimum of 1 shovel
test per 3 acres for projects greater than 200 acres. As such, a total of 204 shovel tests were
necessary to meet the TSMASS. Horizon met these by producing 204 shovel tests over the
Project Area.
A selective-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. Any nondiagnostic cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) observed on the surface or
within shovel tests were tabulated, described, and photographed in the field and then
subsequently returned to where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., lithic tools,
projectile points, charcoal, etc.) were collected for analysis and further documentation. Field
notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, cultural material
observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for every shovel test,
including location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts encountered. Digital
photographs, along with a photo log describing the context of each photograph were also
completed. A handheld GPS unit that utilizes the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83 map
datum was used to record pertinent location data. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure
14, and shovel test data are provided in Appendix A.
Horizon’s original Scope of Work included the potential for backhoe trenching along the
eastern boundary of the Project Area in the event that deep alluvial soils were present along
Potranco Creek. Subsequent evaluation of the area found that 4 factors made this method
impractical. First, as stated above, modern farming practices have intensively modified fields
along the original west bank of Potranco Creek (which also serves to delineate the eastern
boundary of the Project Area). Therefore, there was little promise of yielding intact cultural
deposits. Second, an elevated, packed-earth road currently runs along that same boundary
(Figure 15), further reducing the likelihood of finding in situ or undamaged artifacts. Third, like
the rest of the Project Area, extensive and intensive shovel tests in the area confirmed the
presence of non-native soils to an average depth of approximately 20 to 30 cmbs. These nonnative soils rest on a lens of dense caliche and clay (refer to Section 2.4 of this report).
Previously registered archeological sites in the area (including the 5 outlined in Section 4.0 of
this report) were found exclusively through surface investigation, and not in shovel tests. This
suggests similar conditions for nearby sites. Finally, the San Antonio Water System (SAWS)
has recently constructed a sewer line that runs the entire length of the eastern boundary of the
Project Area and immediately west of the existing packed-earth road (Figures 16 and 17). This
means backhoe trenching would have to be conducted at least 50 meters from the eastern
boundary of the Project Area in areas where shovel testing again showed only shallow clay soils
over caliche. With these factors in mind, backhoe trenching was not needed to investigate 30
cm of soils overlying the subsurface caliche. After careful consideration, Horizon decided to use
its time and resources more productively.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The intensive cultural resources survey within the Project Area resulted in the
identification of 5 isolated chert implements consisting of 1 bifacial chert core, a second large
probable chert core, and 3 chert flakes (Figures 18 through 23). All 5 were found at separate,
distinct locations across the Project Area, with no obvious clusters noted that would constitute a
formal archeological site. While these 5 specimens appear to be aboriginally reduced, the
identification of cultural lithic technology is hard to identify on the Project Area due to agricultural
processes that are currently taking place on the land that can often create similar characteristics
on stone. Heavy concentrations of chert nodules, chert cobbles, and lithic flakes were identified
in the agricultural fields across the Project Area, but none seem to have clear striking platforms,
bulbs of percussion, or the telltale signs of deliberate and systematic reduction. Thus, they
likely are products of modern-day farming. Aside from the 5 previously mentioned isolated
artifacts, no other cultural resources were identified or documented on the Project Area. No
cultural features, burned rock, or organic remains were observed at the site, either through
pedestrian survey or shovel test.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the documentation of only a handful of isolated artifacts on the Project Area, it
is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the Project Area will have no adverse impact on
significant cultural resources. Furthermore, plow zone disturbance over the shallow rocky soils
within the Project Area diminishes any real potential of finding intact buried, stratified cultural
deposits. Thus, Horizon recommends that no further investigations are warranted on the
Project Area and that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking. However, in
the unlikely event that cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the
THC and the City of San Antonio should be notified of the discovery.
