ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the City of Natalia, Texas was performed by
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on November 23, 2015. The Texas
Historical Commission (THC) issued Antiquities Permit 7473 for this project. This
survey examined 1.24 miles of proposed wastewater line with an easement of 1.5
feet iand the crossing at Fort Ewell Creek (0.222 acres). The field methods
included a 100% pedestrian survey and shovel testing. No evidence of a
prehistoric site was observed. A sparse scatter of historic trash was found within the
working easement but it was not considered necessary to record it as a historic site.
It is recommended that the City of Natalia be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Copies of the report will be housed at the THC, Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), Texas State Library, City of Natalia, Kelley
Environmental Consulting, regional libraries, and BVRA. After the survey was
completed and the draft report submitted, the client decided against installing
waterline in the 1.24 mile cross country segment. The results of that portion of the
survey remain in the report in case the area is considered for ground disturbance in
the future.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Natalia proposes to improve their wastewater system by
connecting an existing sewer plant to a lift station on property owned by Love’s
Truck Shop in southeastern Medina County (Figure 1). The distance of the
proposed project is 1.24 miles with a survey easement of 20 feet. The pipe will
be 6-8 inches in diameter and placed in a trench at a maximum depth of 3-4 feet.
In addition, two concrete pillars supporting an 8 inch aerial wastewater line over
Fort Ewell Creek will be replaced. The existing pipe will be removed and replaced
in the same ditch. The connection will occur about 20 feet from the creek on
each side. When the original pipe was installed, the ground on either side of the
trench was disturbed for a distance of more than the width of the working
easement. Other types of disturbance that have affected this area include
construction of State Highway 132 North, a waterline, and an old foam factory on
the south side of the creek. Disturbance to the north side was highway
constructon and the waterline. There are no cemeteries or standing structures in or
near the Area of Potential Effect (APE). Funding for this project will be provided
by the USDA-RUS. Figure 2 depicts the project area on the USGS 7.5’
topographic quadrangle Lytle (2998-224).

ENVIRONMENT
Medina County consists of 1,334.53 square miles in an area that varies
from fertile valleys to scenic hills. The altitude also varies from 635 in the valleys
to 1995 ft. in an area referred to as the “Texas Hill Country.” The county is
drained by the Medina River and several major creeks that flow in a south to
southeasterly direction. The nearest source of water to the APE is Fort Ewell
Creek, a tributary of Chacon Creek about 35 km to the west. The existing
wastewater treatment plant is on the eastern bank of this stream. The climate in
the area is defined as semi-arid. The January mean minimum temperature is 37°
F and the July mean maximum temperature is 94° F. Rainfall averages 27.3
inches annually (Alvarez 2004).
According to the General Soils Map in the soil survey for Medina County
(Dittmore 1977), the majority of the area where the new pipeline will be placed is
located within the Duval-Miguel-Amphion soil association that is comprised of
nearly level to gently sloping upland sands. The remainder is within the NuecesPalito-Eufala soil association that is also comprised of nearly level to gently
sloping upland sands. The specific soils in the area of the proposed new pipeline
(from west to east) are Nueces soils, 0 to 5 percent slopes (NuC) and PatiloEufala association, gently undulating (Figure 3). The C-horizon in the Nueces
soils averages 16 inches below the ground surface and it is believed to have
been developed during the Eocene epoch. The B-horizons of the Patilo and
Eufala soils average 56 inches below the ground surface. The parent material of
these soils is Carrizo sand that also developed during the Eocene epoch.
More specifically, the proposed wastewater line passes through two soil
associations. These are the Nueces soils, 0 to 5 percent slopes (NuC) and the
Patilo-Eufala association, gently undulating (PEC). Beginning at the lift station,
the waterline crosses approximately 2000 feet of PEC soils. The soil survey for
Medina County (Dittmore et al. 1977:31) states that this association consists of
dunelike or hummocky soils. PEC soils consist of fine sand to a depth of 48
inches before turning into sandy clay loam. The remainder of the proposed
waterline passes through NuC soils that are typically found in level to gently
sloping terrain Dittmore et al. 1977:28). These soils consist of fine sand that
continues to a depth of 34 inches before turning into sandy clay loam. The creek
crossing lies within soils of the Divot Series, specifically Divot clay loam (Do).
These soils are found on flood plains and alluvial fans of streams. In a typical
profile, the upper level (0-16 inches) consists of clay loam with calcium carbonate
concretions. This soil is described as hard and slightly firm. At 16 inches, it
transitions to clay and limestone fragments are sometimes present. Figure 3
depicts the various soils in the project area.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
General
According to a statistical overview of prehistoric sites in Texas by Biesaart,
et al. (1985:Figure 15), Medina County is located in the Central Texas Culturalgeographical region of Texas, an area that encompasses 34 counties (Figure 4).
It is one of the counties in the extreme lower reaches of this region and it borders
Atasacosa and Frio counties in the Southern Coastal Plains Culturalgeographical region. Because of the proximity of Medina County to this adjacent
region, some cultural traits were probably shared between the prehistoric
inhabitants of both regions. The statistical overview cannot be viewed as 100%
accurate but it does provide a time frame for comparisons. For example the
overview reports that only 23 prehistoric sites in Medina County had been
recorded at TARL in 1985. Unfortunately, the overview does not give site
numbers but it does list them by temporal period. In 1985, the 23 recorded
prehistoric sites were classified as Paleoindian (n=2), Archaic (n=17), and Late
Prehistoric (n=4). No sites had been formally excavated and only three sites are
described as having been tested by hand. The major form of disturbance is
described as erosion (n=15) and vandalism (n=12). Burned rock mounds and
middens and quarries represent the majority of site types documented in the
county. Today, there are 250 prehistoric and historic sites in the county that
have been recorded at TARL. This increase of 987% is related to an increase in
construction projects associated with a growing population of the area.
Previous Investigations in the County
The first site to be recorded in the county was in 1968 when D. Ping Hsu
investigated an area on the edge of an old slough where animal bones were
found upstream from two flakes and a possible burin. No new sites were
recorded in the county until 1972 when Leland W. Patterson recorded 41ME3 as
a source of flint and primary chipping area. Two years later, Scorpion Cave
(41ME7) was recorded in a river bottom. The site yielded skeletal remains of a
bear and a variety of arrow points and dart points. In 1984, perhaps the most
significant prehistoric site to be recorded in the county was found on a terrace of
San Geronimo Creek by Wayne C. Young during a project for the State
Department of Highways and Public Transportation (now TxDOT) during a
survey for the State Highway 16 project. The site was recorded at TARL as
41ME29 and given the name Jonas Terrace. Leroy Johnson, Jr. (1995) authored
a very comprehensive report on the importance of this site that “represents 45
centuries of time.” He (Johnson 1995:1) also states that “…excavated sites with
fairly long geological histories are rare in Central Texas.” Although several
important sites have been recorded in the county, the vast majority consist of
sparse lithic scatters, a few quarries or procurement areas, and burned rock
mounds and middens that have been seriously vandalized.

Sites and Surveys Near the Project Area
A review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas revealed that five
prehistoric sites have been documented in the vicinity of the APE and four of
these sites (41ME18 – 41ME21) were recorded by Thomas R. Hester and
Thomas C. Kelley (1976) during a survey for a proposed housing development
on the Medina River. Site 41ME18 is described on the site form as an “open
site” in a plowed field. Two probable distal tips of dart points were found along
with a biface and some blades. Because ashy charcoal was found in gopher
burrows, W. Hayden Whitsett believed at the time that the site is buried beneath
20-30 cm of modern deposits. He recommended that it be tested to determine its
eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
The other sites recorded nearest the APE are 41ME19 and 41ME20
(Hester and Kelley 1976). Site 41ME19 was found on the bank of Fort Ewell
Creek and is described on the site form as an area with dark soil 30-35 cm deep.
Artifacts observed included one Perdiz point, one Leon Plain sherd, lithic debris
and well preserved bone. In addtion, two hearths were observed. This site is
0.52 km northwest of the creek crossing relevant to the current survey. Site
41ME20 lies on the east side of Fort Ewell Creek less than 40 m from the creek
crossing. Site 41ME20 was recorded by W. Hayden Whitsett in 1976 (report not
available). The site form is very brief and lacks some important data such as the
area of occupation that is stated as unknown but possibly 30 m x 70 m.
According to the site form, the site was “split” by the construction of the bridge
across the road. Bone was the most common indicator of the site but the form
does not describe it. Flint debitage was observed but decribed as “sparse” and
found only on the creek bank. Without better information, the validity of this area
as a prehistoric site is questionable. The other closest sites (41ME21 and
41ME22) are lithic scatters at least 0.90 and 1.86 km, also to the northwest.
The end point of the proposed pipeline is Love’s Truck Stop adjacent to
Interstate Highway 35 South. According to the Archeological Sites Atlas, this
area was surveyed with negative results. The Atlas does not identify the survey
or provide any information. A second unidentified survey, also negative, was
conducted approximately 0.50 km to the north of the proposed route of the
waterline.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the presence of previously recorded
sites and archaeological surveys in the project area and vicinity. Relevant
archaeological reports documenting work in Medina County were reviewed in order
to become familiar with the types of sites found in the area. Reports and articles
by Hester and Kelley (1976), Johnson (1995), and Turpin (1994) were among those
reviewed prior to this study. Major works such as Perttula’s (2004) The Prehistory
of Texas were also examined. The field methods included a 100% surface
inspection and/or shovel testing at the crossing of Fort Ewell Creek and the
proposed pipeline route. The city allowed Art Smith to accompany the Principal
Investigator in an effort to ensure that the correct area was examined. It was
very helpful to have Mr. Smith and a city vehicle to traverse the wooded terrain.
All excavated soil was passed through quarter-inch hardware cloth. Twenty-two
shovel tests were dug along the pipeline route and two tests were dug on each
bank of the creek. Shovel test information was entered onto a shovel test log
(Appendix I) and digital photography was used to capture the various areas and
features of the project area. Shovel test data were plotted on a sketch map and
later onto an aerial photograph (Figure 5). The daily activities were written in a field
notebook.
The field survey was carried out on November 23, 2015. Work began at the
lift station on the Interstate Highway 45 service road (Figure 6). The vast majority
of the pipeline will be placed in an upland setting at elevations between 700 and
750 feet above mean sea level (amsl). In upland areas the chances for deeply
buried sites are very low. Shovel tests in this area were dug to depths of 50 cm or
greater. The first shovel test was dug at the lift station (Figure 7). In this area, the
soil was sandy and ground visibility was at least 80%. The second test was dug at
the point where the pipeline will turn to the west. The distance from the lift station
to Shovel Test 2 is 426 feet Shovel Test 2 was dug through sandy loam and
terminated at 55 cm. Once the footprint of the proposed pipe progresses in a
virtual east/west direction, tests were dug at intervals of 100 m when possible. This
segment crosses relatively level terrain through large areas of pasture that are
occasionally interrupted by woods and very thick brush containing large clumps of
prickly pear and other thorny plants. The distance of this segment is 0.90 miles.
Every attempt was made to survey in a straight line using a compass and following
the fenceline but there were times when some areas had to be avoided. The third
test was dug 100 m from Shovel Test 2. The soil was still sandy and this test was
dug to 65 cm with no artifacts present. A large whiteware plate fragment was seen
on the surface about 80 m from the previous shovel test. Surface visibility in the
area was excellent. A thorough surface inspection failed to identify additional
artifacts in the immediate area of the find. Shovel Test 4 was dug to 65 cm near the
location of the plate fragment. No artifacts were found deeper than 30 cm Artifacts
recovered included 1 small clear glass fragment, 1 whiteware fragment, and 1 fired
clay fragment that was probably part of a piece of utilitarian ware.

Additional tests were excavated in this area in an effort to determine the
aerial extent and depth of artifacts within the easement. The discovery test was
surrounded by single tests 5 feet to the north and south. Shovel Test 5 was dug
north of the discovery test and yielded four small thin pieces of clear glass and a
second fired clay fragment that also appears to have been part of some type of
utilitarian ware. Shovel Test 6 was south of the discovery test ad yielded four small
thin pieces of clear glass and a well-fired ceramic piece that could not be identified.
The east/west extent of positive tests was determined by excavating
additional shovel tests. Tests 7-10 were dug to the east and terminated at 50 cm.
Shovel Test 10 was dug 117 feet from the discovery test and was negative. Test 7
yielded 2 pieces of clear glass and only 1 piece of clear glass was found in tests 8
and 9. Tests 11 and 12 were dug to the west and the presence of artifacts was
only extended an additional 21 feet. The western boundary is assumed to be near
the location of Shovel Test 12 where no artifacts were recovered. Only one piece
of clear glass was found in Shovel Test 11. These tests were not as deep as the
others because of a gradual slope.

11

The survey continued along the fenceline with the next test being dug 100 m
from the hypothetical western boundary of the trash scatter. Testing continued until
about 20 m from County Road 772. There was one area that could not be shovel
tested due to extremely thick vegetation. It was bypassed and the remaining 10
tests were dug. The pipeline will be placed in already disturbed right-of-way along
the eastern side of County Road 772 for a distance of 1024 feet. The distance from
the county road to the sewer plant is 384 feet. No testing was required in either
area because of prior disturbance. Prehistoric site 41ME18 was recorded at the site
of the wastewater treatment plant but it has been virtually destroyed by construction
of the plant. Plus, no new construction will occcur in this area.
The creek crossing has been severely disturbed to the point that it is highly
unlikely that any in situ soils remain. As stated in the Introduction, the only ground
to be disturbed will be about 20 feet on either bank. The original profile of both
creek banks has been altered due to the construction of the trench for the aerial
pipe and the water line that crosses in the creek bed (Figure 8). The trenches and
working easements for these two pipes have virtually displaced all original soil from
within the current easement. The depression in the land caused by highway
construction and/or installation of one or both of the pipelines leading to the north
bank is vividly illustrated in Figure 9.

The final phase of this survey was an examination of the creek banks. It
was immediately obvious that the landforms on either side had been disturbed. In
addition to a visual inspection of the creek from the bridge, shovel testing was
conducted on both banks to average depths of 30 cm. Two tests were dug on each
bank and each one encountered black clay at or near the surface. The only cultural
materials observed consisted of modern trash.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
sites had been previously recorded within the boundaries of the current project area
and no portion had been examined by a professional archaeologist. The field
survey involved one full day of surface inspection and shovel testing. No
prehistoric sites were found. A small historic trash scatter containing whiteware,
other unidentified ceramics, and fragments of clear glass was found within the
working easement. It was not considered worthy of recording as a historic site.
Two interesting objects were found in the vicinity of the scatter (Figure 10). These
objects are rusty metal pins or stakes about five feet apart. A careful search of the
area failed to locate additional pins. Roger G. Moore stated that they are very
similar to old tent stakes. They were firmly embedded in the ground and that
suggests to me a more permanent use.
The absence of prehistoric sites within the footprint of the proposed
wastewater line is probably due to a lack of a source of dependable water in the
immediate area. The nearest part of the APE to water is the existing sewer plant
that is about 11 km distant. It is at this location that site 41ME18 was recorded.
The cross country route of the pipeline is no closer than 40 km from the same
source that is a tributary of Fort Ewell Creek. At one time, the entire area where the
pipeline will be installed was probably wooded and it seems likely that its attraction
to native groups would have been as a source of food derived from plants and
animals. Short term camps could have existed but it is unlikely that evidence of
these sites are easily discernable today. Sites 41ME18, 41ME19, and 41ME20
were recorded as being very close to the crossing of Fort Ewell Creek that was
inspected during this survey. Site 41ME20 is less than 40 m from the creek
crossing and is closest recorded site to that area. As stated above, this site was
identified mainly by bone and a sparse amount of lithics at the creek bank. The site
is also described as shallow, 30 – 40 cm below the surface. Both sides of the
easement have been greatly disturbed due to road construction and installation of
the existing pipe that it is possible that no in situ evidence of a shallow site exists
today. Certainly, fish and certain edible plants may have been collected in
prehistoric times but evidence of these activities are very unlikely to be located.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. Should evidence of a prehistoric or historic site be encountered during any
phase of construction in any of the areas investigated, all work must stop until the
THC can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the THC.
