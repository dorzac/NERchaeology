ABSTRACT
A Phase I cultural resources survey for a proposed type V GG liquid waste
processing facility on a 7.73 acre site in south-central Washington County, Texas was
performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates on December 28, 2011. The project
area is in the floodplain of Little Sandy Creek. It was investigated by backhoe trenches
(n=7), and no evidence of prehistoric or historic sites was found. The processing facility
will be constructed on a portion of the tract (1.55 acres) that has been covered with
approximately five feet of fill dirt. Therefore, this area was not subjected to backhoe
trenching. The seven trenches were excavated within the footprint of the proposed
sewer line and randomly across the project area. It is recommended that construction
be allowed to proceed as planned. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas
Historical Commission, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, the Texas State
Library, Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA), and L&G Environmental.

INTRODUCTION
L&G Environmental, LLC is the owner of the property that was investigated by
BVRA for this report. The construction plans consist of a Type V GG waste processing
facility on a 7.33 acre tract just north of the city limits of Brenham, Texas in Washington
County (Figure 1). The site is bounded on three sides by private property and on the
east side by State Highway 105. The project area occupies 5.60 acres on the north
side of Little Sandy Creek and 2.13 acres on the south side of Little Sandy Creek in a
sparsely wooded area that is currently being used as pasture for cattle. In order to
protect the facility from floods, it will be placed on an existing elevated pad on the north
side of Little Sandy Creek (Figure 2) and buffered by a concrete berm. The processing
facility will consist of three areas. They are an unloading area, a storage containment
area, and a dewatering area. The unloading area will be supported by a concrete slab
that is 385 square feet in size and 10 inches thick. The storage containment area will
be supported by a concrete slab that is 2862 square feet in size and 10 inches thick.
The dewatering area will be supported by a concrete slab that is 981 square feet in size
and 10 inches thick. Concrete curbs will be constructed around the perimeter of the
unloading and dewatering areas. These curbs will be 14 inches wide and vary in depth
from 12 to 14 inches. A concrete wall is proposed for the perimeter of the storage
containment area. It will be 7 inches wide, and the depth will vary from 2.50 feet to 2.75
feet.
A sewer line (432.97 feet) will connect this facility with an existing City of
Brenham sewer line on the south side of the creek. The diameter of the pipe is four
inches, and it will be placed in a trench that is thirty inches wide and forty-eight inches
deep. Part of the discharge line, approximately 120 linear feet, will be placed in areas
of fill. About 60 feet of discharge line will be placed in fill beneath the elevated pad
north of Little Sandy Creek, and approximately 60 feet of discharge line will be placed
beneath the area of fill associated with the lift station south of Little Sandy Creek. The
discharge line will cross the creek approximately three feet above the bottom of the
creek bed using a technique described by engineers as an âaerial crossing.â The aerial
crossing segment of pipe will be housed in a steel casing supported by concrete piers.
Access to the waste processing facility will be possible due to a road that will be
approximately 360 linear feet long and twenty feet wide. This road will be constructed
by scraping and removing the topsoil and vegetation, and it will be covered with road
base. Previous disturbance to the site was caused by the installation of a temporary
drain that was placed in a trench that varied from 3.5 feet to 6 feet in depth. This drain
was removed before the fill was added to create the elevated pad.

Because the project area is located adjacent to an apparent dependable source
of water (Little Sandy Creek) in a region known to contain significant archaeological
sites, the THC viewed the area as a potential site for prehistoric and/or historic sites.
Therefore, a Phase I cultural resource survey was required by the Archeology Division
of the THC with Jeff Durst as the project reviewer. In order to satisfy this requirement,
the client retained BVRA to perform the archaeological survey that was carried out on
December 28, 2011.
The project area map was created from an engineering map prepared by
Coursen-Koehler Engineering Associates, and it is depicted on the 7.5' U.S.G.S.
topographic quadrangle Brenham, TX (3096-123) dated 1963 and photorevised 1989
(Figure 3).

ENVIRONMENT
Washington County is located in Southeast Texas in the Blackland Prairies Land
Resource Area and the Claypan Land Resource Area. The size of the county is 614
square miles (392,960 acres). The climate is considered to be moderate. In the winter,
the average temperature is 52Â° and the average summer temperature is 83Â°. The total
annual precipitation is 39.65 inches. Of this, 50% falls in April through September.
Significant natural resources include soil, oil, gas, lignite, rock, gravel, and water.
The topography of the county consists of rolling prairies of sandy loam drained by
the Brazos River and its tributaries. Elevations range from 200 to 500 feet with the
highest landforms in the northern part of the county. According to the soil survey for
Washington County (Chervenka et al. 1981), soils in Washington County formed under
post oak and grass. Those soils that formed under timber are light colored fine sandy
loams and loamy fine sands. Those that formed under grass are dark fine sandy loams,
clay loams, and clays. If unprotected, these soils are subject to erosion. The soil in the
project area is Bosque clay loam, frequently flooded (8). This deep, nearly level soil is
found in bottomland settings. A typical soil profile is described as a dark gray clay loam
about 22 inches thick at the surface that is followed by a mottled grayish-brown and
pale brown loam from 22 to 40 inches and a dark gray clay loam from 40 to 62 inches.
This soil is well drained, runoff is considered slow to medium, and permeability is
moderate. Areas of this soil that have sparse to dense stands of pecan, elm, or
hackberry trees are used mainly for native or improved pasture. A few of the higher
areas or\\are cultivated. At the time of this survey, the vegetation consisted of elms,
hackberry, Texas Ash, Box Elder, Pecan, and Sycamore trees and a ground cover of
native grasses that was predominately Johnson grass. Other plants observed were wild
sage, wild onion, and poison ivy. Figure 4 depicts a small stand of native trees on the
south side of the creek.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Washington County is located in the Southeastern Region of Texas as defined by
the Texas Historical Commission (Figure 5). It is only one county removed from the
Central Texas Archeological Region to the north and borders the Southern Coastal
Corridor Archeological Region to the south. No sites in Washington County listed as
significant or critical appear in the Planning Document prepared by the Texas Historical
Commission for the central and southern regions of Texas (Mercado-Allinger et al.
1996). However, due to its proximity to other regions it is likely that Washington County
shares cultural traits with its neighboring counties. According to a statistical overview
prepared by the Office of the State Archeologist (Biesaart et al. 1985), there were only
16 sites recorded in the county in 1985. At that time, the number of sites in the county
represented only .08% of the total for Texas. In 1985, 8 sites in Washington County
were listed as Archaic and 8 were listed as Late Prehistoric, and all 16 sites
experienced some form of disturbance.
A background check at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory revealed
that Washington County has a relatively low number of documented archaeological
sites as compared to other counties in the state. Most of these sites have been
recorded as the result of salvage work at Lake Somervell or during oil and gas related
projects. Other sites have been recorded by individuals such as Nathan L. Winfield, Jr.
who recorded 41WT7 - 41WT11 and 41WT13. The majority of the remainder of sites in
Washington County have been recorded or evaluated by contract firms such as Espey,
Huston & Associates, Inc. (41WT42 - 41WT47; 41WT60; 41WT65), Prewitt and
Associates, Inc. (41WT25 - 41WT29; 41WT33 - 41WT40; 41WT48 - 41WT55; 41WT63
- 41WT64), BVRA (41WT68) and federal and state agencies such as the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (41WT62), Texas Archeological Salvage Project
(41WT1 - 41WT4) Texas A&M University (41WT17 - 41WT18), and the United States
Corps of Engineers, Galveston District (41WT30 - 41WT31).
The earliest record of professional archaeological activity in Washington County
was at Boggy Creek where Dee Ann Suhm and Rudolph C. Troike of the University of
Texas visited the area and assisted Nathan L. Winfield, Jr. in a survey of this area in
1955 (Hasskarl 1961). Three areas containing cultural materials were examined; the
Central Midden site, the South Knoll site, and the Creek site. Later, they were recorded
together as 41WT12. In the Central Midden site arrow point types Perdiz and Scallorn
were found in the top level mixed with dart point types Gary, Morrill, and Palmillas.
Although Gary points were found in all levels, only the lower levels contained Kent,
Pedernales, Edgewood, Ellis, Ensor, and Yarbrough. The Central Midden site and the
South Knoll site contained an abundance of fresh water mussel shells and are
described by Hasskarl (1961:298) as shell middens. The Creek site contained
hearthstone fragments in addition to mussel shell. Unidentifiable ceramics were found
at the Central Midden and Creek sites. Faunal remains from the three areas include
mussel shell, deer, and antelope. Based on the records check at TARL, this is the only
site in Washington County that has been tested.

There have been three archaeological surveys in the vicinity of the project area.
These investigations were carried out by professional archaeologists working with or for
the Rural Electrification Administration in 1984, the State Department of Highways and
Public Transportation (now Texas Department of Transportation) in 1985, and the
Farmers Home Administration in 1986. Not one of these projects recorded sites, and
copies of the reports documenting these surveys were not available for review. Two
prehistoric sites have been recorded between 530 and 570 meters of the project area.
They are 41WT17 and 41WT18.
Site 41WT17 is located 570 meters west of the project area on the northern end
of an upland spur overlooking Little Sandy Creek 250 meters to the north. This site was
recorded in 1980 by Harry J. Shafer who described it as an âopen lithic site,â 3 x 5
meters in size, and destroyed when the City of Brenham constructed Linda Anderson
Park. Material collected include chert, quartzite, and silicified wood flakes (some
burned), biface fragments, and sandstone. Shafer believes that this site may date to
the Late Archaic based on the character of the lithic debitage. No further work was
recommended.
Site 41WT18 is located 530 meters southwest of the project area on a lower
slope of an upland finger overlooking Little Sandy Creek 340 meters to the north. This
site was recorded by Harry J. Shafer in 1989 who described it as an âopen campsiteâ
that is probably post-Archaic. Material collected include chert flakes and mussel shell.
This site was destroyed when the City of Brenham constructed Linda Anderson Park.
No further work was recommended.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator checked the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas in order to identify any previously recorded archaeological
sites in the project area and immediate vicinity. Jonathan Jarvis checked the site files at
TARL and found that no sites have been identified in the current project area and that
the area had not been investigated by a professional archaeologist. Several contract
reports documenting work in Washington County were reviewed in order to ascertain
the kinds of archaeological sites known in the area.
The field survey was conducted under the supervision of William E. Moore with
assistance from Rhonda Holley and Valgene Horak. The area was investigated by a
surface inspection and backhoe trenches. Three backhoe trenches were excavated
within the footprint of the proposed wastewater discharge line, and four trenches were
excavated randomly within the project area. Since the liquid waste processing facility
will be constructed on a pad that was constructed by borrowed dirt that extends five feet
above the ground surface, there was no reason to dig a trench in this area. The
location of the backhoe trenches is depicted in Figure 6. The soil was uniform
throughout except for Backhoe Trench 7 where several distinct lenses of soil were
observed. A profile drawing was made in the field and professionally drafted for this
report (Appendix I). Samples of earth from selected trenches were collected and
analyzed by soil scientists at the Natural Resource Conservation Service office in
Bryan, Texas. Photographs were taken of each trench (general view and profile), and
they appear in Appendix II. Control for the backhoe trench map was created by
measuring from the connecting point at the waste processing facility, the connecting
point at the City of Brenham sewer line, and from the trenches to the creek with a metric
tape. A backhoe trench log was maintained in the field and appears as Appendix III to
this report. The area where the road will be improved was not shovel tested for two
reasons. First, its distance from the creek makes it a very low probability area for a
prehistoric site. Second, the impact from construction will be minimal as there is very
little topsoil present in this area. The scraping that is planned will be mainly through a
clay stratum.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
No prehistoric archaeological sites were found within the 7.73-acre project area.
The backhoe trenches revealed the presence of clay loam over clay, and standing water
was present in one trench. The area investigated is considered to be a low probability
area for a significant prehistoric site. It is not uncommon for prehistoric sites to occur in
a floodplain setting where they have been buried by one or more flooding episodes.
The most common use of floodplains in prehistoric times was related to the collecting of
plants, animals, and riverine resources such as fish and mussel shell. Since mussel
shell was found at site 41WT18 on the same creek, it was considered possible that this
resource may have been exploited in that part of Little Sandy Creek adjacent to the
project area. However, no shell was observed in any of the backhoe trenches or in the
creek bank. The major form of disturbance was due to the clearing of trees to create
pasture for cattle. Trees have extensive root systems, and any cultural materials within
the path of a developing root would be moved from its original position. Therefore, it is
unlikely that intact cultural materials are present beneath of the surface of the project
area. Prior to the addition of the fill that created the elevated pad a temporary drain was
placed in a trench that varied from 3.5 feet to 6 feet in depth. This drain was removed
before the fill was added to create the elevated pad. The two known sites on Little
Sandy Creek in the immediate area are situated on higher elevations in settings
containing sandy soil. Just to the north of the project area is a ridge that contains sandy
soil (Figure 7), and this is the most likely setting for a prehistoric site. The presence of
alternating strata of clay and sand suggests four separate episodes of flooding, but
backhoe trench 7 is the only area where this was observed.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No significant archaeological sites were found during this cultural resources
survey. Therefore, it is the recommended that the City of Brenham be allowed to
proceed with construction as planned. Should, however, cultural materials be identified
in areas not discussed in this report, all work should cease until the situation can be
evaluated by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission, BVRA, and the
City of Brenham.
