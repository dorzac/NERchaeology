ABSTRACT
Between February 20–21, 2007, and on March 2, 2007, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc.
(Blanton & Associates) conducted an intensive archeological survey of approximately 1.86 miles of
existing and proposed FM 685 right-of-way in Williamson County, Texas (CSJ: 0757-01-016). The
survey was performed at the request of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Austin
District prior to proposed roadway widening and bridge replacement construction on FM 685 between
US 79 and SH 130. Investigations discovered no archeological deposits within the existing and proposed
ROW, so no artifacts were collected and curation was unnecessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Investigations for Roadway Widening and Bridge Replacement
Construction on FM 685 between US 79 and SH 130, Williamson County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with shovel testing and backhoe trenching of 1.86 miles of existing and proposed
right-of-way (ROW) prior to roadway widening and bridge replacement construction on FM 685 between
US 79 and SH 130 in Williamson County, Texas. Surface and subsurface investigations discovered no
archeological materials within the project area.
The existing FM 685 ROW ranges from 100 to 125 feet wide and contains an undivided roadway that is
44 feet wide with four 11-foot wide lanes and no shoulders. The proposed construction would expand the
ROW to 200 feet wide while widening the majority of the roadway to 124 feet wide to accommodate six
12-foot wide lanes, two of which would be turn lanes, 10-foot wide paved shoulders, and 38 feet of clear
space between the edge of the roadway and the ROW boundary. Where FM 685 intersects US 79 and SH
130, there would be slightly different typical sections. At US 79, the proposed ROW would be 200 feet
wide with a 92-foot wide roadway containing six 12-foot wide lanes (including left and right turn lanes)
and 10-foot wide shoulders. Approximately 700 feet north of SH 130, the ROW would be 200 feet wide
with a 68-foot wide roadway with four 12-foot wide lanes and 10-foot wide shoulders. The estimated
depth of impacts for roadway construction would be approximately two feet.
In addition to roadway improvements, the existing bridge over Brushy Creek would be replaced. As the
proposed construction would reconfigure FM 685 to a divided highway, the existing bridge would be
replaced by two separate bridges—one for the northbound lanes and one for the southbound lanes. The
existing bridge is about 55 to 60 feet wide with four 12-foot wide undivided lanes. The northbound bridge
would be approximately 40 feet wide and 845 feet long with a 38-foot wide roadway containing two 12foot wide lanes, a 10-foot wide outside shoulder, and a four-foot wide inside shoulder. The southbound
bridge would be 845 feet long and roughly 55 feet wide with a 50-foot wide roadway containing three 12foot wide lanes, a 10-foot wide outside shoulder and a four-foot wide inside shoulder. The estimated
maximum depth of vertical impact during bridge construction is 10 to 12 feet below ground surface. The
overall FM 685 Area of Potential Effect (APE) for archeology is therefore 9,611 feet (1.86 miles) long
and 200 feet wide.
PROJECT LOCATION: The linear project area is in southern Williamson County approximately two
miles southwest of the City of Hutto, Texas.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 44 acres
DATES OF WORK: February 20–21, 2007, and March 2, 2007.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and subsequent amendments) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas.

PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4350
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Based on the lack of archeological deposits within the project area, Blanton &
Associates, Inc., recommends that the construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the existing
and proposed FM 685 ROW without additional archeological investigations, as no archeological historic
properties eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places or archeological sites eligible
for formal State Archeological Landmark designation would be affected by the proposed project.
However, one two-story house that appeared more than 50 years old was noted adjacent to the proposed
ROW and Blanton & Associates also recommends that it should be evaluated by a professional
architectural historian prior to construction. If the planned construction should require additional work
space beyond the proposed ROW, then additional investigations in those areas would be necessary prior
to construction.

INTRODUCTION
Between February 20–21, 2007, and on March 2, 2007, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc.
(Blanton & Associates) conducted an intensive archeological survey of approximately 1.86 miles of
existing and proposed FM 685 right-of-way (ROW) between US 79 and SH 130 in Williamson County,
Texas (CSJ: 0757-01-016). The survey was performed at the request of the Texas Department of
Transportation’s (TxDOT) Austin District prior to the proposed widening of FM 685 (Figures 1 and 2).
The existing FM 685 ROW ranges from 100 to 125 feet wide and contains an undivided roadway that is
44 feet wide with four 11-foot wide lanes and no shoulders (Figure 3). The proposed construction would
expand the existing ROW to 200 feet wide while widening the majority of the roadway to 124 feet wide
to accommodate six 12-foot wide lanes, two of which would be turn lanes, 10-foot wide paved shoulders,
and 38 feet of clear space between the edge of the roadway and the ROW boundary (see Figure 3). There
would be slightly different typical sections where FM 685 intersects both US 79 and SH 130. At US 79,
the proposed ROW would be 200 feet wide with a 92-foot wide roadway containing six 12-foot wide
lanes (including left and right turn lanes) and 10-foot wide shoulders. Approximately 700 feet north of SH
130, the ROW would be 200 feet wide with a 68-foot wide roadway with four 12-foot wide lanes and 10foot wide shoulders. The estimated depth of impacts for roadway construction would be approximately
two feet.
In addition to roadway widening, the existing bridge over Brushy Creek would be replaced. As the
proposed construction would reconfigure FM 685 to a divided highway, the existing bridge would be
replaced by two separate bridges—one for the northbound lanes and one for the southbound lanes
(Figure 4). The existing concrete slab bridge is about 55 to 60 feet wide with four 12-foot wide undivided
lanes. The northbound bridge would be approximately 40 feet wide and 845 feet long with a 38-foot wide
roadway containing two 12-foot wide lanes, a 10-foot wide outside shoulder, and a four-foot wide inside
shoulder. The southbound bridge would be 845 feet long and roughly 55 feet wide with a 50-foot wide
roadway containing three 12-foot wide lanes, a 10-foot wide outside shoulder and a four-foot wide inside
shoulder. The estimated maximum depth of vertical impact during bridge construction is 10 to 12 feet
below ground surface. The overall FM 685 Area of Potential Effect (APE) for archeology is therefore
9,611 feet (1.86 miles) long, 200 feet wide, and encompasses approximately 44 acres.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered by
TxDOT, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), now subsumed
in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for
recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political
subdivision of the State of Texas, defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the
laws of this state, including a city, county, school district, or special district created under the Texas
Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must
identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage
those SALs.

It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to consider the effects on historic properties that might be threatened by actions that are
federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states
that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any historic properties eligible for
inclusion on the NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or
permitted by federal agencies.
The federal regulatory process is described in detail in the ACHP regulations (36 CFR 800) and in the
regulations of the agencies and federal divisions engaged in historic preservation. Protection of cultural
resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site significance as defined
by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the ACHP is the final arbiter of the Section
106 process, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and concurrence by the involved agency
and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC).
The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources discovered
within the APE, evaluate their eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and
should eligible archeological historic properties and sites be found, make recommendations for future
management options such as avoidance, preservation, or further investigations. Investigations were
conducted in accordance with the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the FHWA, the
THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) among TxDOT and
THC. The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in
the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the
Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the Blackland Prairie area of central and eastern Williamson County.
The Blackland Prairie is upland grasslands covering approximately 11.5 million acres from Grayson and
Red River Counties in northeast Texas to Bexar County in the south−central region of the state in an area
approximately 44,500 square kilometers in size (Jordan et al. 1984:31). Elevations range from 300 to
800 feet above mean sea level (amsl). Blackland Prairie soils are so named for the ubiquitous, darkcolored calcareous clays present throughout the area.
GEOLOGY
The project area is primarily underlain by Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk that consists of thick deposits
of chalk and marl. However, along Brushy Creek and an unnamed north bank tributary of Brushy Creek
there is recent (Holocene) Quaternary Alluvium. The alluvium contains calcareous floodplain deposits
composed of clay, silt, sand, and gravels (Barnes 1974). In terms of the best potential for discovering
buried archeological deposits within the APE, recent alluvium like that along Brushy Creek, has
consistently shown to contain buried cultural deposits along local and regional drainages.
SOILS
Soils in the project area between US 79 and Brushy Creek are from the Branyon-Houston Black-Burleson
Association, which consists of dense and clayey soils formed in marine clays and shales and found on
ancient stream terraces and uplands. Along Brushy Creek are soils of the Oakalla-Sunev association that
consist of recent clayey alluvium found on bottom lands. Between Brushy Creek and SH 130 to the south
are soils of the Austin-Houston Black-Castephan association, which consist of dense calcareous upland
clayey soils that formed in situ from ancient marine chalk, clay, marl, and shale (Werchan and Coker
1983). With the exception of the recent alluvium along the creek, the upland soils possess little to no
potential for containing intact buried cultural deposits.
VEGETATION
The project area lies in the Texan biotic province, which represents a transitional zone between the
eastern woodlands and the western grasslands (Blair 1950). The province has been divided into four
subregions: the Blackland Prairie and Grand Prairie of the Blackland Prairies region, as well as the Oak
Woodlands and Eastern Cross Timbers of the Oak Woods and Prairies region (Blair 1950). The proposed
project area is located in the Blackland Prairie subregion, which primarily supports tall and medium
grasses such as little bluestem (Andropyron smithii) and hairy tridens (Tridens pilosus), as well as
deciduous riparian species dominated by American elm (Ulmus Americana), hackberry (Celtis laevigata),
pecan (Carya illinoensis), and box elder (Acer negundo). Land use throughout the study area is almost
exclusively agricultural on the west side of FM 685 while east of the highway is extensive commercial
and residential development.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to field investigations, a review of data available at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and on the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was conducted to determine
the presence of any previously recorded sites or previous project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of the
project area. The online review indicated that several previous archeological investigations have been
conducted near the project area. The earliest archeological investigation in the immediate area was
conducted by the Soil Conservation Service in 1980 along an unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek about
200 meters to the east-northeast of the FM 685 crossing on Brushy Creek. No archeological resources
were discovered during the survey (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, Williamson County files).
In 1995, site 41WM819 was recorded during a survey for the Pflugerville 138 KV North Loop
transmission line located about 225 meters northwest of the US 79/FM 685 intersection. Several sherds of
prehistoric ceramics were observed on site, as well as several large secondary flakes, but the site was not
recommended for additional investigations. During the same survey a prehistoric lithic scatter (site
41WM820) was recorded about 250 meters upstream from the FM 685 crossing of Brushy Creek. Similar
to 41WM819, the site was not recommended as NRHP or SAL eligible (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
Williamson County files).
Extensive survey efforts in 2001 for the proposed SH 130 corridor, which trends north to south roughly
900 meters west of the FM 685 at Brushy Creek, recorded two archeological sites within 1,000 meters of
the project area. On the south bank of Brushy Creek approximately 900 meters upstream from FM 685 is
site 41WM1026. This site is a shallowly buried prehistoric camp that was not recommended for
additional investigations (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, Williamson County files). North of
41WM1026 and Brushy Creek is historic homestead site 41WM1017. The site was not recommended for
further investigations.
During archeological investigations for SH 130 in 2002, buried prehistoric camp 41WM1010 was
discovered, recommended eligible for inclusion to the NRHP and for formal SAL designation, and
subjected to data recovery excavations by PBS&J (TARL, Williamson County site files). Following
several design changes to the then-proposed SH 130 in 2003, archeologists returned to 41WM1010 to
conduct survey and test excavations in parts of the site not previously investigated. Shovel testing,
backhoe trenching, and test excavations exposed 14 lithic scatter and burned rock features. Artifact
recovery was limited to lithic debitage, a few faunal remains, and burned rock (Karbula et al. 2004).
Since the middle to late nineteenth century, agricultural plowing and land clearing has disturbed the
surface and subsurface (ca. 0 to 30 centimeters below ground surface) of the project area. However, given
the presence of recent alluvium along Brushy Creek and the previously recorded sites with buried
components discovered just upstream from FM 685, it was anticipated that there was a good potential for
the existing and proposed ROW to contain buried cultural materials.

METHODS
The intensive archeological survey on FM 685 involved surface and subsurface investigations of
sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of any discovered
archeological. Investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the
Council of Texas Archeologists (1987) and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS
1983). Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the PA among the FHWA,
the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC. Field
investigations were thoroughly documented with digital cameras and no cultural materials were collected
so curation was unnecessary.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project areas by two
archeologists systematically examining the ground surface for cultural remains. Cutbank profiles were
inspected for the presence of any buried cultural materials within the APE. As there was recent alluvium
in the APE with soil sufficient to contain intact buried cultural deposits, subsurface investigations
emphasized backhoe trenching to prospect for buried cultural deposits, as per CTA and THC guidelines.
Excavated backhoe trenches were approximately 5.0 meters (16.4 feet) long, 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) wide,
and 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) deep and plotted with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS). Following
excavations, archeologists immediately cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts,
cultural features, and/or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units identified in each trench
were described in detail on a Blanton & Associates geologic profile form. All trenching activities were
monitored by an archeologist to avoid any unnecessary damage to potentially buried cultural deposits.
The THC (n. d.) minimum survey standards recommend systematic shovel testing at a 100-meter interval
(approximately 16 shovel tests per mile) for linear project areas with less than 30 percent ground surface
visibility. These investigations diverged however from those standards because the geology, clay soils
that developed in situ, and previous mechanical disturbances of the uplands in the study area preclude the
presence of buried intact archeological deposits. Thus, judgmental shovel testing was utilized in upland
contexts.
Shovel tests were 30 to 40 centimeters in width and excavated with a square-head shovel to an average
depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface or until soil conditions prohibited further excavation.
Upland areas in the APE that contain clay soils and have been disturbed by past agricultural plowing were
subject to judgmental shovel testing because the upland soils in those locations formed in situ and have
little to no potential for contain intact buried archeological deposits that could contribute new or
important data concerning regional prehistory and history. Given these conditions, it was felt that 50
centimeter-deep shovel tests were sufficient to determine the presence of any cultural materials that may
be shallowly buried in the ancient upland clays. All sediments removed from shovel tests were screened
through ¼-inch wire mesh and shovel test data was recorded on Blanton & Associates shovel test form
and plotted with hand-held GPS receivers.

SURVEY RESULTS
Surface and subsurface archeological investigations discovered no archeological or historical resources
within the existing and proposed FM 685 ROW (Figure 4). The majority of the east side of the existing
FM 685 ROW, as well as much of the proposed ROW east of FM 685, have been significantly disturbed
by the construction of surface and subsurface utilities (i.e., waterlines and fiber optic cables), ditches,
culverts, and massive earth moving (i.e., land clearing, leveling, and grading) for the recent development
of residential subdivisions. Additional surface and subsurface utilities serving the new subdivisions have
also impacted much of the proposed ROW east of FM 685. West of FM 685, the existing ROW has been
impacted by ditches and overhead and buried utilities, while the proposed ROW occupied primarily
plowed fields.
SURFACE INVESTIGATIONS
East of FM 685 in the northern part of the study area between US 79 and Brushy Creek, land use
encompassed commercial and residential development, including the large Hutto High School campus in
the southeast quadrant of the US 79/FM 685 intersection, as well as commercial establishments to the
south (Figure 5). South of the commercial development are a series of residential subdivisions located
north and south of Brushy Creek (Figure 6). The portions of these properties that occupy the existing and
proposed ROW have been impacted by heavy construction equipment, as these locations were/are utilized
as construction staging areas (Figure 7). Moreover, in the southeast quadrant of the FM 685/Riverwalk
Drive intersection, development of the Riverwalk Subdivision involved the realignment of an unnamed
south bank tributary of Brushy Creek, which included the construction of an earthen berm along the creek
for flood control. The berm was constructed using earth scraped from immediately adjacent areas,
including the proposed ROW (Figure 8). The approximate southern most 0.25 mile of proposed ROW
east of FM 685 is undulating prairie and plowed fields (Figure 9), several of which contained standing
water at the time of investigations.
On the west side of FM 685, land use has remained agricultural since the mid-nineteenth century and
surface investigations found that the proposed ROW west of FM 685 consisted almost entirely of fallow
plowed fields that afforded 100 percent surface visibility (Figures 10 and 11). Just south of Brushy Creek
and west of the highway is a large aggregate and cement production facility (Figure 12).
Although the surface examinations discovered no archeological resources within the existing or proposed
FM 685 ROW, an historic grave site was observed west of FM 685 just outside the APE (see Figure 4).
The area was approximately 20 feet west of the western edge of the proposed ROW and 400 feet north of
the unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek (Figure 13). The grave site was defined by five wooden lathes
labeled “Center Grave Site” and “Corner Grave Site.” The ground within the staked area had been
recently excavated and backfilled with heavy machinery. As Figure 14 indicates, the excavated area was
sunken in places and approximately 25 large cut and dressed limestone slabs littered the surface. No
inscriptions could be found on any of the limestone slabs, but the smoothed and dressed appearance
strongly suggested grave markers. The presence of the grave site was unexpected as pre-field background
research revealed no evidence of a family or public cemetery at that location on: 1) the 1936 General
Highway Map of Williamson County, Texas; 2) the aerial photograph in the Williamson County Soil

available for Williamson County (e.g., Osborne 2003; Sheppard 2007).
Discussions between the TxDOT Austin District and Eric Stromberg, the former owner of the property,
indicated that the grave site had contained two family members (2007 personal communication). Mr.
Stromberg explained that he showed a professional archeologist (identity not provided) where the family
members were buried and that they were the only burials in the area. Moreover, Mr. Stromberg stated that
the staked area, which was established by the archeologist prior to exhuming the burials, was larger than
the actual grave locations. Mr. Stromberg described that the Stromberg family had owned the property in
question for several generations prior to selling the land in 2006 (2007 TxDOT Austin District, personal
communication).
A review of Williamson County naturalization records (Osborne 2003) available online indicated that an
A. R. Stromberg from Sweden filed naturalization papers in Williamson County in 1887. The records also
reveal that in 1892 and 1906 naturalization papers were filled for two individuals from Sweden with the
name H. E. Stromberg. It is assumed these are two different individuals as both are listed as 34 years of
age, respectively, in 1892 and 1906. Williamson County probate records available online indicate that a
Hilding E. Stromberg died in 1931 (Osborne 2003). Presumably, Hilding E. Stromberg was one of the
two H. E. Strombergs registered in the naturalization records. Additionally, online data from
Ancestory.com (2007) for Williamson County death records lists 11 Stromberg deaths between 1931 and
2000, while birth records from the same web page indicate that eight individuals with the last name of
Stromberg were born in Williamson County between 1903 and 1997.
The proposed ROW nearest the grave site was carefully inspected for indications of unmarked graves.
The examination yielded no sunken areas suggestive of burials or mechanically disturbed locations
intimating that the archeologist that exhumed the Stomberg burials prospected for unmarked graves in
other locations. As the area in question is in the uplands, it was not shovel tested given that the clay soils
at this location developed in situ from marine clays and shale and therefore, have little to no potential for
containing buried intact archeological deposits. Additionally, the area has been extensively impacted by
decades of plowing and farming. However, two backhoe trenches (BHT 10 and 11) bracketed the
proposed ROW nearest the grave site and yielded no evidence of unmarked graves (see below).
In addition to the grave site, the survey noted one two-story farm house approximately 2,500 feet north of
Brushy Creek and within 100 feet of the proposed ROW (Figure 15, see Figure 4). The house appeared
more than 50 years old but no historic artifacts or features were observed within the proposed ROW. At
the time of the survey, the house was occupied so no subsurface testing was conducted in the proposed
ROW that traversed the structure’s front yard.

SUBSURFACE INVESTIGATIONS
Backhoe Trenches
Because the majority of the project area consisted of upland clays that developed in situ from ancient
marine sediments, subsurface investigations focused on trenching the recent alluvial deposits along
Brushy Creek and its unnamed tributary, while judgmental shovel tests were excavated in upland areas
across the APE. A total of 11 backhoe trenches were excavated to prospect for deeply buried cultural
material (Appendix A). Backhoe trench excavations in the APE revealed deep clayey and gravelly
alluvium over limestone bedrock gravels and/or solid marly limestone. Angular and water-worn limestone
rocks and gravel were common inclusions observed in the various soil zones delineated during backhoe
trenching.
Backhoe Trenches 1, 2, and 3 were located south of Brushy Creek and west of FM 685. The trenches
extended, respectively, to maximum depths of 130, 170, and 175 centimeters below ground surface and
contained no cultural materials (see Figure 4). Five stratigraphic zones were delineated in BHT 1, while
BHTs 2 and 3 contained three zones (Figures 16 and 17; see Appendix A). Subsurface investigations were
not conducted in the southeast quadrant of the FM 685 crossing of Brushy Creek due to extensive land
leveling and the presence of substantial amounts of construction fill, buried electric and water lines, and
buried sprinkler lines for adjacent soccer fields and landscaping for the entrance to the Riverwalk
Subdivision (Figure 18). Moreover, access down the steep slope to the lower terrace on the south bank of
Brushy Creek was blocked by silt fencing.

Figure 16. View of the east wall of BHT 1 following
excavation

In the proposed ROW north of Brushy Creek and west
of FM 685, BHTs 4 and 5 were excavated to a
maximum depth of 160 centimeters below ground
surface between Brushy Creek and its unnamed north
bank tributary (Figures 19 and 20). Abundant
fragments of crushed Rabdotus shell were noted
between 37 and 160 centimeters below ground surface,
but no cultural materials were discovered in either
trench (see Appendix A).
The excavations of BHTs 6, 7, 8, and 9 in the
proposed ROW occurred east of FM 685 between
Brushy Creek and its unnamed tributary and on the
north bank of the unnamed drainage. During the
excavation of BHTs 6 and 7, archeologists discovered no cultural materials, only deep clayey alluvium
that extended to depths of 160+ centimeters (BHT 6) and 200+ centimeters (BHT 7) below ground
surface (Figure 21). Up slope from BHTs 6 and 7, the excavation of BHT 8 and BHT 9 encountered the
same alluvium but located topographically higher than BHTs 6 and 7, solid limestone bedrock was
encountered between 140–150 centimeters below ground surface (Figure 22); see Appendix A).
Backhoe Trenches 10 and 11 were excavated in the proposed ROW west of FM 685 north of the unnamed
tributary of Brushy Creek (see Figure 4). Backhoe Trench 10 was excavated approximately 30 meters
north of the tributary and 80 meters south-southeast of the previously described historic grave site.
Backhoe Trench 10 contained three clayey soil zones and extended to a depth of 160 where solid
limestone bedrock was encountered (Figure 23). Backhoe Trench 11 was located about 100 meters north
of BHT 10 near Structure 4 and contained three zones similar to BHT 10 while extending to
150 centimeters below ground surface. Abundant fragments of eroded limestone bedrock were observed
in Zone III (82–150 centimeters below ground surface) of BHT 11. The excavation of BHTs 10 and 11
exhibited no evidence of any historic burials or prehistoric cultural materials (see Appendix A).
Shovel Tests
Judgmental shovel testing in the uplands discovered no buried cultural materials, only moist and dense
gravelly upland clays (Appendix B). Moreover, a significant proportion of the APE is/was under
cultivation, resulting in a disturbed 30 to 40 centimeter-thick (0 to 30 or 40 centimeters below ground
surface) plow zone. A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated in the existing and proposed FM 685 ROW,
with shovel tests extending to a maximum of 50 centimeters below ground surface (see Figure 4). Deeper
shovel tests were deemed unnecessary given the gravelly upland clay soils of much of the existing and
proposed FM 685 ROW that developed in situ from ancient marine sediments and possess little to no
potential for containing intact buried archeological materials.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive archeological survey on FM 685 between US 79 and approximately 700 feet north of SH 130
discovered no prehistoric or historic archeological historic properties or sites within the existing and
proposed ROW. Backhoe trenching along Brushy Creek and its unnamed tributary, as well as judgmental
shovel testing across the study area, discovered no buried cultural materials. Construction of surface and
subsurface utilities, ditches, culverts, and massive earth moving (i.e., land clearing, leveling, and grading)
for the development of subdivisions and roadway construction, as well as over a century of agricultural
plowing, have disturbed the existing and proposed FM 685 ROW sufficiently to preclude the presence of
soils with intact buried cultural deposits. Moreover, the majority of the project area consists of upland
prairie with dense gravelly clay soils that developed in situ and have been disturbed by development and
cultivation, so it is unlikely that the planned construction would impact any previously unknown intact
archeological deposits within the existing and proposed FM 685 ROW.
A recently excavated and backfilled historic grave site was observed about seven meters west of the
proposed ROW north of the unnamed north bank tributary of Brushy Creek and west of FM 685. The
historic grave site contained two members of the previous landowner’s (Eric Stromberg) family that had
been recently exhumed by a professional archeologist (identity unknown) following the sale of the
property. In discussions with the TxDOT Austin District, Mr. Stromberg indicated that there were no
other graves near or in the proposed ROW (personal communication). A review of Williamson County
archival records available online did not identify which family members were buried on the property but
it, along with Eric Stromberg, indicated that Stromberg family has lived in Williamson County since the
late 1880s.
The proposed ROW closest to the grave site was systematically examined for indications of unmarked
graves. The surface examination yielded no sunken areas suggestive of graves or mechanically disturbed
locations intimating that the archeologist that exhumed the Stomberg burials prospected for unmarked
graves locations within the propose ROW. As this area is in the uplands, it was not shovel tested given
that the clay soils at this location developed in situ from marine clays and shale and therefore, have little
to no potential for containing buried intact archeological deposits. However, Backhoe Trenches 10 and 11
bracketed the roughly 100-meter wide area of proposed ROW nearest the grave site and yielded no
evidence of unmarked graves, only dense upland clay overlying ancient clay subsoils or bedrock gravels
and bedrock. Based on the results of the survey of the proposed ROW nearest the grave site, the
information provided by Eric Stromberg, and archival research, it is the opinion of Blanton & Associates
that there are no unmarked graves in the proposed ROW that would be disturbed by the planned
construction.
Investigations also noted a two-story farm house that appeared more than 50 years old adjacent to the
proposed ROW north of Brushy Creek about 20 meters west of the proposed ROW. During the survey, no
historic artifacts or features were observed within the proposed ROW. The house was occupied at the
time of survey so no subsurface testing was conducted in the front yard traversed by the proposed ROW.
Based on the results of the survey, in conjunction with the majority of the project area’s low potential for
containing intact subsurface cultural materials that could contribute new or important data to our

understanding of local and regional prehistory and history, Blanton & Associates recommends that the
proposed construction should be allowed to proceed within the existing and proposed FM 685 ROW
without additional archeological investigations because the survey discovered no archeological historic
properties or sites within the project area. Thus, the proposed construction should not impact any
archeological historic properties eligible for inclusion to the NRHP as per 36 CFR 800.4, or archeological
sites eligible for formal SAL designation, as per 13 TAC 26.8. Additionally, because the two-story
farmhouse adjacent to the proposed ROW north of Brushy Creek appeared more than 50 years old,
Blanton & Associates also recommends that the house should be assessed by a professional architectural
historian prior to construction.
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional ROW or workspace for the proposed construction or
for future construction projects outside of the currently proposed ROW, then additional archeological
survey is recommended in those areas prior to any construction. In the event that previously unidentified
cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area would cease and the
TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental discovery procedures in accordance
with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
