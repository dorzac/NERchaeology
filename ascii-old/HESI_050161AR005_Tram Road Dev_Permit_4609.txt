MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Between July and August 2007, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 3,000-acre (ac) (1,214.0-hectare [ha])
Tram Road development tract (Project Area) located north of Houston in Montgomery County,
Texas. Ryko Development, Inc. (Ryko) is proposing to develop the tract in southern
Montgomery County. The proposed development will require a Section 404 permit issued by
the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and, as such, falls under the jurisdiction of Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Because the 3000ac tract will eventually be maintained by several local Municipal Utility Districts (MUDs), the
undertaking also falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas, and work was
performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4609. The purpose of the investigations was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and to determine their
eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as State
Archeological Landmark (SALs).
Horizon archeologists conducted the intensive survey of the Project Area from 16 July to
10 August 2007 in an effort to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed development. The Project Area consists primarily of swampy bogs and
wetlands interspersed with fingers of sandy, upland ridges. The survey resulted in entirely
negative findings. The survey revealed that approximately 1,800 ac of the total 3,000-ac Project
Area was covered by standing water. A total of 740 shovel tests were excavated over
approximately 1,200 ac of the Project Area where standing water was not present. No cultural
resources were identified in any of the 740 shovel tests.
Site 41MQ52 is a previously recorded prehistoric site located in the southern portion of
the Project Area. The original recorders of this site indicated that the potential existed for this
site to represent 1 of 4 Orcoquiza villages historically noted in the area. The findings of the indepth archival study suggest that site 41MQ52 is not a remnant of 1 of these 4 Orcoquiza
villages as reported on the site form. A close reading of the primary source documents revealed
that the Orcoquiza settlements were located beyond the boundaries of the Project Area.
However, the site was reassessed during the current survey efforts. This reassessment
resulted in the recovery of no cultural materials from mapped site boundaries, substantiating the
conclusions of the in-depth study. Again, no cultural materials (prehistoric or historic) were

recovered from any of the 740 excavated shovel tests or observed on the surface of the
property.
Based on the lack of observed cultural materials within the Project Area, as well as the
low probability that prehistoric or historic peoples would settle, however briefly, in such a wet
and swampy environment, it is Horizon’s opinion that no significant cultural resources will be
impacted by the construction of the proposed Tram Road development. Horizon recommends
that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.

3,000-acre Tram Road Development Tract, Montgomery County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the
approximately 3,000-acre (ac) (1,214.0-hectare [ha]) Tram Road development tract (Project
Area) in Montgomery County, Texas (Figure 1). Ryko Development, Inc. (Ryko) is proposing to
develop the tract situated between Spring Creek and the West Fork of the San Jacinto River.
The Project Area was divided into blocks to simplify the survey and reporting of such a large
tract (Figures 2 and 3). The proposed development will require a Section 404 permit issued by
the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and, as such, falls under the jurisdiction of Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Because the 3,000ac tract will eventually be maintained by several local Municipal Utility Districts (MUDs), the
undertaking also falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas, and work was
performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4609. Ryko, on behalf of the MUDs, contracted
with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to secure all applicable environmental
clearances for the undertaking. The purpose of the investigations was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area and to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as State Archeological Landmark
(SALs).
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an in-depth archival review, an
intensive pedestrian survey of the property, and the production of a report suitable for review by
the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Pollyanna Held served as the project’s Principal Investigator for the field survey and
development of this report. The project has been inactive since the survey was completed, and
the Texas Antiquities Permit for the project has been transferred to several successive Principal
Investigators. Jeffrey D. Owens, Horizon’s Archeology Program Director, is the current Principal
Investigator and holder of the Texas Antiquities Permit for this project, though Mr. Owens had
no substantive role in the original survey. Jared Wiersema of Horizon supervised the field crew
consisting of Ron Ralph, Jim Gillentine, Kris Billings, Greg Sherrod, and Pollyanna Held.
Horizon conducted the survey from 16 July through 10 August 2007. This entailed
intensive surface inspection coupled with the excavation of subsurface shovel tests.
Approximately 1,800 ac within the 3,000-ac Project Area was covered with standing water,

resulting in 1,200 ac within the Project Area where shovel testing was possible. The Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require 1 shovel test per 3 ac on
projects of this size. As such, a total of 1,000 shovel tests would have been necessary over the
3,000-ac tract. However, as noted above, only approximately 1,200 ac of the overall 3,000 ac
were devoid of standing water and contained areas where shovel testing was possible. As
such, a total of 400 shovel tests would have been necessary to comply with the TSMASS.
Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 740 shovel tests over the testable
portions of the Project Area.
Generally speaking, the Project Area consists primarily of cedar bogs, wetlands, and
other inundated, low-lying areas where aboriginal and historical occupations are considered to
be unlikely. However, the swampy, wet areas were often interspersed with bands of fine, deep
sands that were considered to have a more elevated potential for cultural resources, and, as
such, were the primary focus of the cultural investigations. Again, no cultural materials were
identified during the surface inspection or within any of the 740 excavated shovel tests.
Site 41MQ52 is a previously recorded prehistoric site located in the southern portion of
the Project Area. The original recorders of this site indicated that the potential existed for this
site to represent 1 of 4 Orcoquiza villages historically noted in the area. The findings of the indepth archival study suggest that site 41MQ52 is not a remnant of 1 of these 4 Orcoquiza
villages as reported on the site form. A close reading of the primary source documents revealed
that the Orcoquiza settlements were located beyond the boundaries of the Project Area.
However, the site was reassessed during the current survey efforts. This reassessment
resulted in the recovery of no cultural materials from mapped site boundaries, substantiating the
conclusions of the in-depth study. Again, no cultural materials (prehistoric or historic) were
recovered from any of the 740 excavated shovel tests or observed on the surface of the
property.
Based on the lack of observed cultural materials within the Project Area, as well as the
low probability that prehistoric or historic peoples would settle, however briefly, in such a wet
and swampy environment, it is Horizon’s opinion that no significant cultural resources will be
impacted by the construction of the proposed Tram Road development. Horizon recommends
that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The Project Area consists of approximately 3,000 ac (1,214.0 ha) located north of
Humble in Montgomery County, Texas. It is located approximately 2.0 miles (mi) (3.2
kilometers [km]) west of the point where Spring Creek flows into the West Fork of the San
Jacinto River. The Project Area can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Maedan, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 2). A straight, unimproved 2-lane road,
locally known as “Tram Road,” extends the length of the Project Area and meets up with the
Chevron Cross Creek Pipeline corridor in the southern portion of the Project Area (Figure 4).
The Project Area consists primarily of swampy bogs and wetlands interspersed with
fingers of sandy, upland ridges. Approximately 1,800 ac within the 3,000-ac Project Area was
wet and standing water was encountered in areas that appeared as uplands on the topographic
map. In all, the drier, testable areas totaled approximately 1,200 ac within the overall 3,000-ac
tract (see Figure 4).
Thick vegetation consisting of stands of pine, oak, magnolia, and cypress trees
dominates portions of the Project Area that have not been previously disturbed by logging or
clear-cutting activities. As such, surface visibility was poor across most of the Project Area, with
the exception of those areas where logging roads, pipelines, or trails offered an open corridor.
On-site photographs are presented in Figures 5 through 21. Figure 5 shows a general
view of an upland formation near Shovel Test (ST)-JWA14 in the southern portion of the Project
Area. Figure 6 shows shallow, clay soils from ST-JWA13 excavated on an upland formation in
Block 1 (see Figure 5). Figures 7 through 10 show high probability upland areas within Blocks 1
and 2 situated above Spring Creek toward the southern portion of the Project Area. Many of
these uplands are surrounded by water. Figure 11 shows one of the pristine wetlands found
throughout the Project Area. The central portions of the Project Area (Blocks 7 to 15), typified
by the undulating pattern of wet, swampy areas interspersed with slivers of uplands, are
presented in Figures 12 through 20. The northern portions of the Project Area (Blocks 16 to
20), presented in Figures 21 through 23, are primarily wet except for the dry, sandy uplands
concentrated mainly toward the West Fork of the San Jacinto River to the east.

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in south-central Montgomery County, Texas, north of the
Houston city limits. Montgomery County is situated on the Gulf Coastal Plain in southeastern
Texas inland from the Gulf of Mexico shore. The Gulf of Mexico represents a structural basin
formed by lithosphere deformation. The Texas Coastal Plain, which extends as far north as the
Ouachita uplift in southern Oklahoma and westward to the Balcones Escarpment, consists of
seaward-dipping bodies of sedimentary rock, most of which are of terrigenous clastic origin, that
reflect the gradual infilling of the basin from its margins (Abbott 2001). The Houston area is
underlain by rocks and unconsolidated sediments that are quite young in a geological sense,
ranging from modern to Miocene in age. These consist predominantly of a series of fluviodeltaic
bodies arranged in an offlapped sequence, with interdigitated and capping eolian, littoral, and
estuarine facies making up a relatively minor component of the lithology. Major bounding
disconformities between these formations are usually interpreted to represent depositional
hiatuses that occurred during periods of sea level low stand. The oldest rocks in this fill are of
Late Cretaceous age. As a result of the geometry of basin filling, successively younger rock
units crop out in subparallel bands from the basin margin toward the modern coastline.
The Project Area traverses stream terraces, upland settings, and marshy wetlands
located in the broad undulating region situated at the crux of the West Fork of the San Jacinto

River and Spring Creek. The San Jacinto River, in turn, flows southeastward and discharges
into the Gulf of Mexico.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The Project Area is underlain by the Deweyville Formation and Beaumont Formation
(Shelby et al. 1968). The Deweyville Formation consists of sand, silt, and clay, with some
gravel. The Beaumont Formation consists of mostly clay, silt, and sand. The Project Area is
situated on sandy soils of the Albany-Tuckerman association (McClintock et al. 1971). This
association consists of deep, level to gently sloping, somewhat poorly drained and poorly
drained, sandy and loamy soils on low stream terraces. Specifically, soils within the Project
Area consist of Albany fine sand (Ab), Bruno loamy fine sand (Br), Chipley fine sand (Ch), Hatliff
loam (Hf), and Tuckerman loam, heavy substratum (Tk).

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
While the paleoclimatic history of the coastal region remains unclear, Bryant and Holloway
(1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas that includes
3 separate climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.), the Late
Glacial Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to present).
Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas
was considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region
was more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and
Holloway 1985). The Late Glacial Period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a
slow warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous
woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway
1985). During the Post-Glacial Period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have
been more stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post
oak savannas. The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued
into the mid-Holocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more
mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and
Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were
probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
The modern climate of the upper Texas coast, including the region surrounding Houston,
is classified as subtropical humid (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983), forming a transitional
zone between the humid southeastern US and the semiarid to arid west. The climate reflects
the influences of latitude, low elevation, and proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which combine with
the urban heat island formed by the tremendous concentration of asphalt and concrete to give
the Houston area a notorious modern climate that is oppressively warm and moist throughout
much of the year. As a result of proximity to the Gulf and the abundance of surface water,
humidity in the early morning can approach 100% even on cloudless summer days, and it often
exceeds 50% even on the warmest afternoons. Largely as a consequence of the relatively high

HJN 050161 AR 05

19

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

humidity characteristic of the region, temperature patterns exhibit a moderate annual range and
a modest diurnal range that increases slightly with distance from the coast. Average monthly
high temperature ranges from a low of 17 to 19 degrees Celsius (°C) (59 to 63° Fahrenheit [F])
in January to a high of 38 to 40° C (89 to 96° F) in August. Average monthly lows range from
4 to 9° C (38 to 47° F) in January to 25 to 29° C (72 to 79° F) in July and August. Annually,
average low temperatures range from 15 to 21° C (56 to 65° F), and average high temperatures
range from 27 to 29° C (75 to 79° F) (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983).
The Houston region experiences 2 precipitation peaks throughout the year (Abbott 2001;
McClintock et al. 1971). The first occurs in the late spring (i.e., May to June) due to the passage
of infrequent cold fronts that spawn chains of powerful frontal thunderstorms. The second
occurs in the late summer to early autumn (i.e., August to September) due to the incidence of
tropical storms and hurricanes from the Atlantic and, occasionally, Pacific oceans. In contrast,
winter and early spring are relatively dry, and high summer rainfall is dominated by convectional
thunderstorms that are relatively brief and localized, albeit frequently intense. Average annual
precipitation varies from a low of approximately 100 centimeters (cm) (40 inches [in]) to a high
of more than 132 cm (52 in). Average monthly precipitation varies from less than 5 to 8 cm (2 to
3 in) in March to more than 19 cm (7.5 in) occurring locally on the coast during September.
Almost all of the measurable precipitation falls as rain—snowfall is extremely rare, occurring in
measurable amounts in only 1 in 10 years.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

Montgomery County is situated near the southeastern edge of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. McMahan et al.
(1984) further define 4 broad communities that characterize that portion of the Texan biotic
province that lies on the Gulf Coastal Plain: (1) coastal marsh/barrier island, (2) coastal prairie,
(3) coastal gallery forest, and (4) pine-hardwood forest (cf. Abbott 2001:24-26).
The coastal marsh/barrier island category includes well-drained, sandy, coastal
environments and saline and freshwater wetlands in the coastal zone (Abbott 2001:24). Marsh
vegetation is typical of areas that are seasonally wet and have substrates composed primarily of
sands and silts, clays, or organic decomposition products. Vegetation assemblages are
strongly controlled by texture, salinity, frequency and duration of inundation, and depth of the
seasonal water table. Sandy, relatively well-drained, freshwater environments are typically
dominated by little bluestem, switchgrass, Florida paspalum, and brownseed paspalum. Wetter
environments are often dominated by marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, saggitaria,
bulrushes, smooth cordgrass, seashore paspalum, seashore dropseed, olney bulrush,
saltmarsh bulrush, saltmarsh aster, longtom, sprangletop, burhead, arrowhead, coastal
waterhyssop, needlegrass rush, and other sedges and rushes. Slightly higher, better-drained
environments are characterized by such taxa as seashore saltgrass, seashore paspalum,
gulfdune paspalum, shoregrass, gulf cordgrass, red lovegrass, bushy sea-oxey, and glasswort.
A variety of fauna are characteristic of the shore zone. Important larger taxa include raccoon,

20

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
3,000-acre Tram Road Development Tract, Montgomery County, Texas

nutria, alligators, turtles, swamp rabbit, and many birds, including ducks, geese, herons, and
many smaller species. Aquatic taxa, including a wealth of fish and shellfish adapted to brackish
to hypersaline conditions, are also important in the coastal zone.
The coastal prairie category consists primarily of grasses with minor amounts of forbs
and woody plants in areas that are not saturated on a seasonal basis (Abbott 2001:24-26). This
community is characteristic of upland areas and grades into the pine-hardwood forest to the
north and east and into the coastal marsh/barrier island to the south. A wide variety of grasses
are found in the prairie environments, but the principal taxa include big bluestem, little bluestem,
indiangrass, eastern grama, switchgrass, brownseed paspalum, sideoats grama, silver
bluestem, buffalograss, threeawn, and Texas wintergrass. Common forbs include Maximilian
sunflower, Engelman daisy, blacksalmon, penstemon, dotted gayfeather, bundleflower, yellow
neptunia, snoutbean, prairie clover, tickclover, wildbean, western indigo, paintbrush,
bluebonnet, ragweed, croton, milkweed, vetch, verbena, and winecup. Woody plants occurring
in the coastal prairie include mesquite, honey locust, huisache, eastern baccharis, sesbania, live
oak, elm, hackberry, bumelia, and coralberry. The frequency of trees increases dramatically as
the coastal prairie grades into the pine-hardwood forest, forming an open woodland
environment with common stands of hardwood trees and occasional pines. The coastal prairie
is home to a diverse fauna, including coyote, white-tailed deer, skunks, cottontail rabbit, many
small rodents, amphibians and reptiles, and a variety of permanent and migratory birds. Bison
and pronghorn were also present at various times in the past.
The coastal gallery forest consists of diverse, principally deciduous trees and associated
understory in floodplains and streams that traverse the outer coastal plain (Abbott 2001:26).
Important taxa include water oak, pecan, poplar, American elm, cedar elm, sugarberry, ash,
loblolly pine, post oak, cherrybark oak, mulberry, swamp chestnut oak, willow oak, sweetgum,
hawthorn, dogwood, hickory, bois d’arc, sassafras cypress, willow, cottonwood, and sumac.
Shrubs and vines such as mustang grape, greenbrier, yaupon, coralberry, possumhaw,
elderberry, honeysuckle, dewberry, and blackberry are common in the understory, as are
grasses such as little bluestem, big bluestem, and indiangrass. The fauna of the gallery forest
include white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, turkey, a variety of small mammals and
rodents, turtles, snakes, and many birds. Black bears were also present at various times in the
past, and a number of fish and a few varieties of shellfish are present in the streams.
The pine-hardwood forest is characterized by a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees,
including longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, post oak, red oak, white oak, blackjack oak,
willow oak, and live oak (Abbott 2001:26). Riparian environments often support larger
deciduous trees like pecan, cottonwood, hickory, beech, and American elm. Understory
vegetation varies from relatively open to quite dense, and consists of shrubs, vines, forbs, and
young trees. Common shrubs include acacia, yaupon, mayhaw, wild persimmon, myrtle,
greenbrier, Virginia creeper, blackberry, dewberry, trumpet vine, gourd, and poison ivy. A
variety of fauna is also present, including white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit,
mink, skunk, various small rodents, turtles, reptiles, and many different birds. Black bears were
also present at times in the past, and bison and pronghorn were occasionally present in the
transition zone to the coastal prairie environment.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21county area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 200 km (124 mi) inland from the Texas gulf coastline. In broad terms, much of
the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between the Southern
Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995; Story 1990).
Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of
Southeast Texas. These 2 subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the inland
subregion has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast Texas
comprises a zone about 25 km (16 mi) inland from the coast that covers the area influenced by
gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable ecological variability
characterizes this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes, wetlands, marine
coastline, and barrier islands. The inland subregion also encompasses considerable ecological
diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting-andgathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to
denote Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural
characteristics of Southeast Texas cultural periods are often different than in neighboring
regions. For instance, the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and
Southeast Texas, and Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for
Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time
in Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit
evidence of reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be
associated with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of
subsistence-related activities. Inland sites tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired
clay balls (at some sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites
tend to consist of multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain oyster shell tools, large
quantities of pottery (in later cultural components), numerous bone tools, and few lithic
materials.

Chapter 3: Cultural Background

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5000 BC)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 BC (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (but see Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is
represented by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 BC) (Patterson 1995). This stage
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end
scrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas
are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is
little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced during all prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 BC), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian
period (8000 to 5000 BC), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).
3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5000 BC TO AD 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 BC to AD 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas.
Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and
corresponding decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a
diversified resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas,
however, this hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The

24

050161_05_arch_survey_report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
3,000-acre Tram Road Development Tract, Montgomery County, Texas

appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone
assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural
stage. Material culture shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in
the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 BC) is marked by the presence of
Bell, Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The
Bell point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains.
Many of the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 BC) and
several new types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and
probably the Gary-Kent series. The Late Archaic period (1500 BC to AD 100) is characterized
by Gary, Kent, Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition
developed in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981;
Patterson 1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period
but reached full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as
boatstones and bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang
knives, stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial
practices included the systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre,
and use of locally made grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most
burials are found in extended supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials
are also known. Burial direction is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to
site. Patterson et al. (1993) report that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary
tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (AD 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 BC, in the Galveston Bay area by
about AD 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about AD 300, and in the ConroeLivingston inland area by about AD 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears to have
progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995).
Southeastern Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where
Aten (1983) established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area

HJN 050161 AR 05

25

Chapter 3: Cultural Background

80 mi (129 km) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal exception of a
few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf
Coast west of the Sabine Lake area.
Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and early part of the Historic period (Aten
1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility ware
throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown Plain
for about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods
before once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety,
Goose Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor
pottery types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway
(Aten 1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte
types are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste
(like Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (AD 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (AD 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the
latter part of the Late Prehistoric period; however, as previously discussed, ceramics appear
earlier in Southeast Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland sub-region along with the bow and arrow through the
Late Prehistoric period (Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995;
Wheat 1953). In fact, Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in
Southeast Texas as early as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points
that consisted of marginally retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a
generalized date of adoption of the bow-and-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca.
AD 600) in Central and Southeast Texas. In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to
be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba,
Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto
Plain and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek
pottery remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt

3,000-acre Tram Road Development Tract, Montgomery County, Texas

Coated pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (AD 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue.
Aten (1983) has
reconstructed the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century,
including the Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco (possibly Karankawa), and Tonkawa. The
presence of the Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central
Texas in the 17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought
to have occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the
corresponding mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east
of the San Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe
may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in identifying Historic
Indian sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and possibly Fresno and
Cuney points after AD 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites are usually identified
by the presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1700 AD TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near
Galveston Bay; however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where
the burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the
time heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous
Indian population was greatly diminished. The Alabama/Coushatta Indians who currently reside
in Southeast Texas are migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early
19th centuries (Newcomb 1961).
The earliest European explorer of what became Montgomery County was probably the
Frenchman René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who evidently passed through the area in

HJN 050161 AR 05

27

Chapter 3: Cultural Background

16871. When news of French incursions reached Spanish authorities, they sent several
expeditions to the region to reclaim it for Spain. During the mid-18th century the Spanish made
several attempts to establish settlements in the area and eventually set up 3 missions on the
banks of Spring Creek within the current boundaries of Montgomery County, but the missions
were abandoned in 1756 and no permanent Spanish settlements were established. The future
Montgomery County area was included in the colonization contracts issued by Spanish and later
Mexican authorities to empresario Stephen F. Austin, and, during the early 1820s, AngloAmerican settlers began moving into the region. Forty-two families of Austin’s colony obtained
land titles from the Mexican government and settled in western Montgomery County. Among
the earliest settlers was Andrew Montgomery, who established a trading post at the crossroads
of the Loma del Toro and lower Coushatta traces. He was soon joined by relatives and others,
and the settlement eventually grew into the town of Montgomery. During the early 1830s, the
population of the region increased rapidly, and, in December 1837, the Republic of Texas
Congress established Montgomery County, which was named for its largest settlement. The
new county was carved from Washington County, and its borders originally extended from the
Brazos River on the west to the Trinity on the east, and from the Old San Antonio Road on the
north to the San Jacinto River on the south, an area that included future Grimes, Walker, San
Jacinto, Madison, and Waller counties. The county’s present boundaries were established after
the establishment of Waller County in 1870.
On the eve of the Civil War, Montgomery County was in most ways typical of the
counties of the region, decidedly Southern in character and outlook, with a rapidly developing
plantation economy. Montgomery remained the largest town, but several other trading centers
had emerged, including Danville, Bay’s Chapel, Cincinnati, and Waverly. Methodist minister
I.L.G. Strickland began preaching in Montgomery in the early 1840s, and, in the early 1850s,
Baptists had organized the first church there. Several private schools also began operating
during the 1850s, including the Montgomery Academy, which earned a reputation as one of the
preeminent schools of the region. The Civil War and its aftermath brought profound changes to
the county. Not surprisingly, given its large number of slaveholders, Montgomery County’s
citizens overwhelmingly supported the Southern cause, and nearly 80% (318 of 416) of those
who went to the polls cast their votes in favor of secession. The county’s men volunteered for
the Confederate army in large numbers, a sizeable number of them serving in the Fourth Texas
Regiment of Hood’s Texas Brigade; others joined Terry’s Texas Rangers (Eighth Texas
Cavalry). Many of the early volunteers saw considerable action during the war, and as many as
three-fourths of them were killed or injured before war’s end. For those who remained at home,
there were other problems to deal with, including lack of markets for goods, shortages, and wild
fluctuations in Confederate currency. The end of the war brought wrenching changes to the
county’s economy. For many of Montgomery County’s white inhabitants, the abolition of slavery
meant devastating economic loss. Prior to the Civil War, slaves had constituted nearly half of all
taxable property in the county, and their loss, coupled with a decline in property values, caused
a profound disruption for most planters. The African-American population of Montgomery

County fared even worse. Most blacks left the farms owned by their former masters to seek
better working and living conditions; however, for the vast majority, the change brought only
marginal improvement. Most ended up working as agricultural laborers or as sharecroppers,
receiving one-third or one-half of the crop for their labors.
Montgomery County escaped much of the strife that many other Texas counties
experienced during Reconstruction. No permanent federal garrison was stationed in the county,
and there was no Freedmen’s Bureau. Citizens nevertheless chafed under local Republican
rule, and there were isolated acts of violence and intimidation directed at African-American
officials. By the early 1870s, the local white elite had once more gained control of the county’s
affairs, and, through the use of the White Primary, literacy tests, and threats, managed to
effectively disenfranchise the black population until the 1960s. Like most of the counties in the
state, Montgomery County experienced a prolonged post-war agricultural depression. During
the Civil War, prices for cotton had skyrocketed, and landowners had planted ever-increasing
amounts of land in cotton to reap the benefits. After the war, falling prices and the loss of cheap
slave labor combined to severely depress the local economy. To make ends meet, many
landowners opted to grow even more cotton, badly depleting the soil in the process. By the
1880s, the soil in many areas of the county was so poor that cotton yields were as low as onethird to three-fourths of a bale per acre. Some farmers turned to livestock-raising or other small
grains, such as corn and wheat, but cotton nevertheless remained the county’s leading cash
crop until the end of the century.
The county’s economy began to recover in the 1870s and early 1880s with the
construction of several railroads. In 1871, the International-Great Northern Railroad was built
across the county; in 1879, a narrow-gauge line known as the Houston, East, and West Texas
was constructed; and, in 1880, the Houston and Texas Central built a branch line from
Navasota to Montgomery and extended eastward to Conroe. The construction of the railroads
touched off an intense controversy concerning the location of the county seat. The first railroad
missed the town of Montgomery. Willis, a new town on the railroad, was voted county seat in
1874, but the county seat was moved back to Montgomery in 1880, after the Houston and
Texas Central was built. In 1889, however, the county seat was moved to the fledgling
community of Conroe, which was situated at the junction of the International-Great Northern and
the newly built Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway. The construction of the railroads also
sparked a major period of expansion in the county. Numerous new towns grew up, and the
population, which had risen only slightly since the Civil War, saw a marked increase. Despite
the loss of considerable territory due to the splitting off of several new counties, the number of
residents grew from 6,483 to 10,154 between 1870 and 1880, and population increased to more
than 17,000 over the next 2 decades.
The construction of the railroads also marked the beginnings of the county’s great
lumbering boom. Commercial lumbering had begun in the county prior to the Civil War, but the
lack of easy access to river or rail transportation severely hampered efforts to exploit the area’s
rich timber resources. With the arrival of the railroads, however, lumbering quickly developed
into a major industry. By 1882, 45 steam sawmills were in operation, and lumbering emerged
as the county’s largest source of income within a short time. The lumber boom gave rise to

HJN 050161 AR 05

29

Chapter 3: Cultural Background

numerous new communities, including Bobville, Cowl Spur, Dobbin, Egypt, Fostoria, Honea,
Karen, Keenan, Mostyn, Leonides, and Security, all of which developed as lumber shipping
points or mill sites. The boom also helped to transform the county in other ways. As late as the
early 1870s, 80% of the county was still covered by thick pine forests. Over the next 4 decades,
much of the county was deforested, permanently altering the landscape and opening the way
for a steady increase in livestock-raising and farming.
The agricultural economy, which had been on the wane since the Civil War, began to
recover in the 1880s. Spurring its growth was the introduction of tobacco, which began to be
planted in large quantities in the 1890s. Much of the tobacco was a fine-grade variety known as
Vuelta Abajo, grown from seeds imported each year from Cuba. The center of the industry was
Willis, which had 7 cigar factories by 1895. High railroad shipping costs and the high initial
investment and labor involved in curing and sweating the tobacco, however, discouraged many
farmers; between 1898 and 1901, the amount of land given over to tobacco production fell
dramatically from more than 1,000 acres to only 70. The subsequent lifting of a US tariff on
Cuban tobacco, which had kept prices artificially high, finally ended the experiment, and no
tobacco was being grown in the county within a few years. The agricultural economy stagnated
at the turn of the century; however, by 1910, it began to show slow but steady growth.
The county, however, experienced a dramatic reversal of fortune in 1932, when oil was
discovered southeast of Conroe. Evidence of oil had been found in the county as early as 1901,
when Santa Fe Railroad engineers drilled a water well and noted traces of oil. Natural gas was
found southwest of Conroe in 1924, and several major oil companies acquired leases in the
area. The initial tests, however, were unsuccessful, and the companies lost interest. In August
1931, however, wildcatter George William Strake began drilling a test well southeast of Conroe
and, on 13 December of the same year, hit oil; by June 1932, Strake had brought in a second,
even larger well, which was spewing out more than 900 barrels daily. The discovery
immediately triggered a tremendous oil boom. Within days, thousands of fortune-seekers,
wildcatters, financiers, roughnecks, and hangers-on flooded the area. The population of Conroe,
estimated at 2,500 in December 1931, blossomed to more than 10,000 within a few months. At
the beginning of 1933, more than 100 wells had been drilled, and more that 25,000 barrels per
day were being produced; by the end of the year, the number of producing wells had grown to
679, and the daily output was more than 52,000 barrels. Oil was subsequently discovered in
several other areas of the county, and the combined oilfields of Montgomery County made it
one the richest oil-producing areas in the nation. Although the vast majority of Montgomery
County residents did not benefit directly from the oil discovery, oil money contributed to a
general prosperity that helped offset the worst effects of the depression. Proceeds from the oil
also helped to remake the face of the county. Roads were graded and paved, new schools
were built, and public buildings and monuments were erected. Conroe experienced a
construction boom as numerous new buildings, including banks, offices, and homes, were
erected with oil money. The population of the county swelled during the boom, growing by
nearly 10,000 between 1930 and 1940, increasing from 14,588 to 23,055. The prosperity
continued during the years of World War II. Oil refineries and a carbon black manufacturing
plant were built, and efforts were intensified to produce as much oil as possible for the war

effort. After the war, oil production declined somewhat, but it has remained one of the county’s
leading sources of income; in 1990 alone, more than 2.7 million barrels of oil were produced.
In recent years, Montgomery County has become a recreation destination for many
Houston residents. The area, with its abundant lakes and forest, offers numerous opportunities
for hunting, boating, fishing, and hiking. Among the most popular attractions are the Sam
Houston National Forest, W. Goodrich Jones State Forest, Lake Conroe, and Lake Woodlands.
Visitors to the area are also attracted by the shopping opportunities in Conroe, the annual
county fair, and the Conroe Main Street Festival.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

GENERAL ARCHIVAL REVIEW

Archival research conducted on the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database
(Atlas) web site indicated that a minimum of 32 cultural resource sites have been previously
recorded within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the Project Area (Figure 24, Table 1) (THC 2007).
Essentially all of these sites are located within 1,000 feet (300 meters [m]) of stream/river
channels or other waterways. Of these 32 sites, only 1 site is located within the boundaries of
the Project Area, while 2 other sites are located in close proximity to the Project Area.
Site 41MQ52 is located within the Project Area boundary and was recorded as an
aboriginal campsite. Recovered artifacts include chert debitage and ceramics. The original
recorders indicated that this appears to be a large campsite and may in fact be 1 of 4 Orcoquiza
villages reported in 18th century documents. As such, this site was also recommended for
further investigations.
While not located on the Project Area, sites 41MQ51 and 41MQ180 are located adjacent
to the boundary of the Project Area (see Figure 24). Site 41MQ51 was recorded as an
aboriginal open campsite where chert debitage and charcoal were observed in soil piles
resulting from animal burrowing. When this site was recorded, no subsurface investigations or
site delineation actions were undertaken. As such, it remains relatively undefined aside from
location data. The original recorders of this site recommended additional testing efforts. Site
41MQ180 is another aboriginal open campsite where lithic debitage and ceramics were
recovered. The recorders of this site indicated that it was potentially significant and therefore
recommended additional testing efforts on the site.
Based on the information contained on the Atlas, at least 6 previous regulatory cultural
resource surveys have been conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the Project Area. In
1981, a survey for the Department of Housing and Urban Development was conducted near the
northeastern border of the Project Area on the east side of the West Fork of the San Jacinto
River. In 1982, the USACE Galveston District required a survey that crossed Spring Creek,
and, in 1990, an archeological survey was conducted along Cypress Creek from Spring Branch
to Kuykendahl Road. In 1996, Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. were contracted by Harris
County to conduct a cultural resources survey of Townsend Boulevard West. Also in 1996, BC
& AD Archaeology, Inc. conducted a survey of the Cypresswood Golf Club Expansion Project.

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research

In 2004, the City of Houston conducted a small survey on the east side of the San Jacinto River
near the town of River Ridge. No boundaries of regulatory surveys are plotted within the current
boundaries of the Project Area (see Figure 24), although it would appear that at least 2 of the
sites (41MQ52 and 41MQ180) were assessed by professional archeologists during the
permitting of a pipeline and gravel quarry that are not mapped on the Atlas.

4.2

IN-DEPTH ARCHIVAL REVIEW

At the request of the THC, Horizon drafted an addendum to the Scope of Work that
included additional archival research pertaining to sites 41MQ51 and 41MQ52 and a purported
historic tram road in the vicinity. A Horizon archeologist accessed the site files and maps
maintained by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in order to gather more
data pertaining to sites 41MQ51 and 41MQ52, as well as any reference to a historic tram road.
Horizon also consulted primary source documents to determine the meaning and location of the
“Springs of Texas” referenced in the site files. Primary source documents included: Spanish
Activities on the Lower Trinity River, 1746-1771 by Herbert E. Bolton (1915), and A History of
Montgomery County, Texas, a Master’s thesis by William H. Gandy (1952).
Tram Road follows a linear path and extends down the length of the Project Area. Indepth archival research included a search for any reference to a historic tram. While
information is replete with general references to logging enterprises and rail lines within
Montgomery County, no information was uncovered relating to a historic tram within the Project
Area.
The original recorders of site 41MQ51 alluded that it could be the location of the “Springs
of Santa Rosa de Alcazar,” which they interpreted as possibly another Orcoquiza (Arkokisas or
Orcoquisac) settlement historically documented by the Spanish in the 18th century (Gandy
1952:9). However, in-depth archival research revealed that “Arroyo (spring) of Santa Rosa de
Alcazar” is the Spanish name for Spring Creek (Castenada 1936:49-50). It appears that the
Spanish word arroyo in this particular case was translated to mean “spring” rather than “ditch.”
Documentary evidence places the main Orcoquiza settlement south of the confluence of
Spring Creek and the San Jacinto River (Castenada 1936:49-50):
The center of headquarters of the tribe seems to have been located on a western branch
of the San Jacinto River called at this time Arrora de Santa Rosa de Alcazar. This
stream has been identified on good authority as the Spring Creek. A short distance
below [emphasis added] the junction of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa about a gunshot
from the banks of the latter, was a village ruled by Chief Canos. Some twenty miles
above was the village of Chief El Gordo (Fatty).

Bolton (1915: 354) presents an account that details the location Chief El Gordo’s village:
El Gordo’s village was located at the junction of two small branches joining the Santa
Rosa, about ten leagues or perhaps twenty miles west of the San Jacinto –evidently Mill
Creek and Spring Creek.

3,000-acre Tram Road Development Tract, Montgomery County, Texas

Based on these accounts, the documentary evidence supports the notion that both
Orcoquiza settlements referenced in the region were located outside the boundaries of the
current Project Area (Figure 25). While the original site form describes site 41MQ52 as being
the potential location of 1 of 4 Orcoquiza villages reported in 18th century documents, the indepth archival review revealed that site 41MQ52 is likely not a remnant of 1 of these villages,
based on settlement locations described in the primary documents. Subsequent investigations
within the site’s boundary (Peyton et al. 2006, 2007) also revealed no cultural materials in either
surface or subsurface contexts. Moreover, it is likely that the bulk of the site has been
considerably impacted by construction activities associated with the pipeline and Tram Road.
Regardless, the Orcoquiza tribe roamed through the county and established camps
along the banks West Fork of the San Jacinto River and Spring Creek (Gandy 1952:9-10).
Unidentified sites and cultural remains potentially exist within the Project Area. As such, the
Project Area was thoroughly assessed by utilizing archival data in conjunction with the findings
of the field investigation.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

Based on the primary source documents, the research design necessitated pursuing 2
lines of evidence that involved integrating the results of the in-depth archival research with an
intensive pedestrian survey within the Project Area.
A 6-person Horizon archeological field crew conducted an intensive pedestrian survey
over approximately 1,200 ac within the 3,000-ac Project Area. This included intensive surface
inspection as well as subsurface shovel tests in areas deemed to have the highest potential for
containing cultural deposits (e.g., terraces adjacent to stream channels and sandy upland
fingers). Only the areas that were dry enough for shovel testing were assessed for cultural
resources (see Figure 4).
In all, the drier, testable areas totaled approximately 1,200 ac within the overall 3,000-ac
Project Area. The TSMASS require 1 shovel test per 3 ac on projects of this size. As such, a
total of 1,000 shovel tests would have been necessary over the 3,000-ac tract. However, as
previously noted, only approximately 1,200 ac of the overall 3,000 ac were devoid of standing
water and contained areas where shovel testing was possible. As such, a total of 400 shovel
tests would have been necessary to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS
by excavating a total of 740 shovel tests over the testable portions of the Project Area.
Additionally, the TSMASS require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas
with the potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 m [3.3 feet] below surface). If such areas had been
encountered within the Project Area, mechanical trenching investigations would have been
warranted to adequately assess the vertical extent of the sandy deposits. However, no such
areas were encountered and, as such, deep trenching efforts were not warranted.
In order to fully assess previously recorded site 41MQ52, Horizon carefully examined
any exposed soils along a pipeline easement through the site boundaries and placed tightlyspaced shovel tests across the landform on which site 41MQ52 is located to determine if any
unrecorded components of the site remain intact outside of the disturbed pipeline corridor.
The field investigation also included a thorough assessment of the Project Area in the
vicinity of nearby site 41MQ51 to determine if the site extends into the boundaries of the Project
Area.

Chapter 5.0: Methodology

A non-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. All non-diagnostic
cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) observed on the surface or within
shovel tests were to be tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently returned to
where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, charcoal, etc.) were
to be collected for analysis and further documentation. Field notes were maintained on terrain,
vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized
shovel test forms were completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data,
depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo
log were also completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum. Shovel
test locations are presented in Figure 26. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The cultural resources survey of the drier, testable 1,200 ac contained within the 3,000ac Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed
during the surface inspection or within any of the 740 shovel tests excavated across the
property.
No evidence of previously recorded site 41MQ52 was identified during the survey.
Numerous shovel tests were excavated within intact portions of the site’s boundary (see Figure
26). While deep, sandy soils were encountered in the vicinity of site 41MQ52, none of the tests
produced any cultural materials.
The field investigation also included a thorough assessment of the Project Area in the
vicinity of previously recorded site 41MQ51 (located outside of the Project Area boundaries).
Shovel tests were excavated on the sandy upland areas north of site 41MQ51 to determine if
the site deposits extend into the Project Area (see Figure 26). Again, none of the numerous
shovel tests in the vicinity of 41MQ51 produced any cultural materials.
No evidence of a historic tram was identified during the survey. No historic artifacts
were identified along Tram Road or within the Project Area.
Shovel tests on upland areas showed extensive variability within landforms. For
example, some of the tests on 1 landform consisted of fine sand that often exceeded 1 m in
depth without producing any cultural materials, while other tests excavated on the same
landform consisted of shallow clay soils (see Figure 6), which also tested negative for cultural
materials.
In general, the shovel tests indicated a moderate degree of disturbance across the
Project Area. Churned sandy loam soils with clay inclusions suggest that large swaths of the
Project Area have been heavily impacted by past clearing at one time or another, most likely
due to logging activities.
Due to the exceedingly wet and swampy nature of the Project Area, the locale was
probably not a prime place for aboriginal occupation. Most of the sites recorded in the area are
concentrated on the banks of the West Fork of the San Jacinto River and Spring Creek (see
Figure 24). Again, no cultural materials (historic or prehistoric) were recovered from any of the
740 excavated shovel tests or observed on the surface of the property.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

From 16 July to 10 August 2007, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey within the 3,000-ac (1,214.0-ha) Project Area.
The Project Area is situated
approximately 3.2 km (2.0 mi) west of the confluence of Spring Creek and the West Fork of the
San Jacinto River. Results of the archival research determined that the bulk of previously
recorded sites are clustered outside the Project Area on the bluff margins above Spring Creek
and the West Fork of the San Jacinto River, respectively.
The archival review revealed that only site 41MQ52 had been previously recorded within
the Project Area. While the original site form describes site 41MQ52 as being the potential
location of 1 of 4 Orcoquiza villages reported in 18th century documents, the in-depth archival
review revealed that site 41MQ52 is likely not a remnant of 1 of these villages, based on
settlement locations described in the primary documents (see Figure 25). Site 41MQ52 was relocated at the intersection of the pipeline and Tram Road. The site is located on deep, sandy
soils situated on an upland margin extending from Spring Creek. No cultural materials were
identified on the surface of the pipeline easement or in any of the shovel tests placed within the
mapped site boundary. It is likely that the bulk of the site has been considerably impacted by
construction activities associated with the pipeline and Tram Road.
The survey revealed that approximately 1,800 ac of the total 3,000-ac Project Area was
covered in standing water. The Project Area generally consists of cedar bogs, wetlands, and
other inundated low-lying areas; however, the swampy, wet areas were often interspersed with
bands of fine, deep sands. Shovel tests from these upland rises consisted of fine sand that
produced no cultural materials from within any of the 740 excavated shovel tests. No sites were
recorded as a result of the survey, including any associated with previously recorded site
41MQ52.
The results of the field survey substantiate the conclusions of the in-depth archival study
that site 41MQ52 is not a remnant of 1 of 4 Orcoquiza villages documented in the region as
reported on the original site form. A close reading of the primary source documents revealed
that the Orcoquiza settlements were located beyond the boundaries of the Project Area.
Again, no cultural materials were identified within the boundary of site 41MQ52 or within any of
the other 740 shovel tests excavated over the property.

7.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the lack of observed/recovered cultural materials, in addition to the low
probability that prehistoric or historic peoples would settle, however briefly, in such a wet and
swampy environment, it is Horizon’s opinion that no significant cultural resources will be
impacted by the construction of the proposed development. Horizon recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.
