MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for the proposed SASI Ranch #7
well pad and associated lease road and pipeline right-of-way (U.S Army Corps of Engineers
Project No. SWF 2011-00132) located approximately 6.4 miles east of Mineola in southern Wood
County, Texas. This cultural resources investigation was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., under
subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for Energy Production Corporation. The
purpose of this document is to provide data for use in the management of cultural resources in
partial fulfillment of obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 (P.L. 96-515), as amended.
Cultural resources investigations consisted of a records search to identify previous cultural
resources surveys conducted in the area and the archeological and historic sites recorded by those
efforts, visual inspection of the project area, and subsurface investigations via the excavation of
shovel tests. Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 8 March 2011. This survey
encountered no significant cultural resources in the project area. Construction of the SASI Ranch
#7 well pad and its associated lease road and pipeline will have no adverse effect any significant
cultural resources, as defined under 36 CFR 60.4. Provided the project is carried out as proposed,
no further cultural resources investigations are recommended. In the unlikely event that any
cultural materials are inadvertently discovered at any point during the construction, use, or
maintenance of the well pad, all work should cease immediately and the Texas Historical
Commission and the Fort Worth District of the U.S Army Corps of Engineers should be notified
of the discovery.

INTRODUCTION

This report presents results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc. (GeoMarine Project No. 30563.03.01), under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC,
for Energy Production Corporation, for the proposed SASI Ranch #7 project area (U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers [USACE] Project No. SWF 2011-00132). The proposed project area is
located approximately 10.3 kilometers (km; 6.4 miles [mi]) east of Mineola in southern Wood
County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed well pad will occupy an area of approximately 4 acres
with a 33.5-meter-wide (m; 110-foot [ft]) lease road and pipeline right-of-way (ROW)
approximately 700 m (2,296 ft) in length extending north. The total area of potential effects for
the proposed project is 9 acres.
The area encompassing the SASI Ranch #7 project area is privately owned; however, the
proposed project will require a 404 permit from the Fort Worth District of the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE-SWL). The purpose of these investigations was to assist Titanium
Environmental Services and Energy Production Corporation with the management of cultural
resources as delineated under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. Â§ 470 et seq.; P.L. 89â665; 80 Stat. 915] and the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 4321â4347; P.L. 91â190; 83 Stat. 852].
Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 8 March 2011 by Geo-Marine Project Archeologist
Christopher Goodmaster and Field Technician Brett Lang. Melissa Green served as the project
Principal Investigator throughout the process of this investigation.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The proposed SASI Ranch #7 project area is located in the Sabine River valley in southern Wood
County, Texas (Figure 2). Situated within the South Central Plains physiographic region, this
area is characterized by rolling or hummocky plains underlain by the sands of the Eocene-age
Sparta, Weches, and Queen City formations (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993). The project
area is situated at an elevation of approximately 96 m (315 ft) above mean sea level on a slope of
0â1 percent on the floodplain of Lake Fork Creek, a tributary of the Sabine River, which bisects
the Tertiary uplands of the South Central Plains (Griffith et al. 2004). An abandoned meander of
Lake Fork Creek forms a network of unnamed tributary channels and ponds to the west of the
SASI Ranch #7 project area. The soils of the proposed project area are alluvial deposits of silts
and clays of Quaternary age derived from the sediments of Lake Fork Creek. The project area is
located near the interface of soils mapped as Manco loam and Estes silty clay. These soils are
somewhat poorly drained, moderately to very slowly permeable, and are subjected to frequent
flooding (Hatherly 1998). Generally, Estes series soils consist of a surface layer of dark grayish
brown silty clay approximately 10 centimeters (cm; 4 inches [in]) thick overlying dark grayish
brown to grayish brown silty clays with yellowish to brownish mottles from a depth of 10â135
cm (4â53 in). Manco soils consist of a surface layer of dark grayish brown loam approximately 8
cm (3 in) thick overlying a grayish brown to gray loam or dark gray silt loam to a depth of 69 cm
(27 in) followed by a gray silty clay loam or clay loam with reddish and brownish mottles to a
depth of 203 cm (80 in). This area is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950; Dice 1943) and is near the boundary between the Post Oak Savanah and the Pineywoods
(Gould et al. 1960). This region supports a diverse biotic community. Mammal species in the
area, either presently or historically, include deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cougar (Puma
concolor), feral hogs (Sus scrofa), black bear (Ursus americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit
(Sylvilagus spp.), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), beaver (Castor sp.), and raccoon (Procyon
lotor). Hydrophilic vegetation, such as water oak (Q. nigra), elm (Ulmus sp.), and black tupelo
(N. sylvatica) and numerous aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates are also common in the area.
The climate of the project area is humid and subtropical, characterized by hot summers and mild
winters.

CULTURAL CONTEXT
This section presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of Native American cultural
chronology and Euro-American history of East Texas. Given the size of the region and the depth
and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this discussion must necessarily
be limited in scope. References are provided to supplement the information summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The earliest known inhabitants of the Pineywoods of East Texas were the broad-spectrum huntergathers loosely referred to as the Paleoindian culture. Over several thousand years, these
nomadic people adopted increasingly restricted territories and targeted the abundant game and
other resources in the region, typically moving in seasonal rounds to procure various foods and
raw materials. During the subsequent cultural period referred to as the Archaic, populations
generally continued this way of life for several millennia based on the abundant nature of
3

resources in the Pineywoods region. By the Middle Archaic period, the people of East Texas
began cultivating starchy and oily seed plants and, in the Late Archaic period, became active in
expansive intraregional social networks based on trade and shared religious beliefs. Gradually,
the Archaic lifestyle became increasingly sedentary, due in part to increased reliance on
horticulture and the development of ceramics. By the Woodland period, the manufacture and use
of ceramics became widespread. The Woodland period continued to expand in cultural
complexity for at least a millennia, resulting in an increase in settled villages, the expansion of
extensive long-distance trade networks, the construction of burial mounds and the development of
elaborate ritual practices, the domestication and cultivation of native plants, and the rise of
societies led by hereditary leaders. From these roots developed the foundation of the Caddo
culture. Over the last millennia, the Caddo settled in permanent villages and continued the
development of maize agriculture and other effective methods of food gathering, processing, and
storage, as well as elaborate ritual life, ranked societies, mound-building, ancestor veneration,
ritual and political centers, long-distance exchange, warfare, competition, and sophisticated craft
production.
A generalized prehistoric cultural sequence for the East Texas culture area is outlined in Table 1.
Detailed synopses of East Texas prehistoric chronology are provided in other sources and will
therefore not be discussed in this report. For additional information, see Kenmotsu and Perttula
(1993), Perttula (1988), Story (1981, 1985, 1990), and Thurmond (1985, 1988, 1990).

HISTORIC EURO-AMERICAN ERA
The initial European penetration into the general area of East Texas occurred in the middle of the
sixteenth century (ca. 1542; Table 2) when the survivors of the Hernando de Soto Spanish
entrada, led by LuÃ­s de Moscoso de Alvarado after de Sotoâs death, entered Texas, probably
somewhere between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas, in their attempt to
reach New Spain by land (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). In 1690, the Spanish
introduced the first of their missionsâwith the goal of eradicating the indigenous religions and
Christianizing the native populationsâin the Hasinai area of East Texas, but abandoned them in
1693 after failing to convert and control the local population (Swanton 1942:46â49).

The earliest French presence in Texas was led by RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who
established Fort Saint Louis in 1685 along the Texas coast in present-day Victoria County (Davis
and Bruseth 2000; Fort St. Louis 2009; John 1975:182), followed later by Louis Juchereau de St.
Denis, who in 1714 set up a trading post at Natchitoches in present-day Louisiana, and by BÃ©nard
de la Harpe, who in 1719 began his trading post, Le Poste des Cadodaquious, in present-day
Bowie County (Harper 2002). Spanish fear of an increased French presence in Texas led to the
decision in 1716 to try again to establish a series of buffer missions and presidios in present-day
East Texas and Louisiana (Cooper et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46â49). When
France and Spain went to war over the issue, the French forced the Spanish to abandon the area
(Newcomb 1961:288). However, after the truce in 1721, the French withdraw from Texas, and
the Spanish reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas.
After briefly regaining control of the area, the French sold it to the United States in 1803 as part
of the Louisiana Purchase.
Following the sale of Louisiana in 1803, the United States considered most of Texas to be part of
the Louisiana Purchase and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939). The
first official American exploration of the East Texas region was by the Freeman-Custis
Expedition in 1806 (Flores 1984). The earliest settlers were largely subsistence farmers residing
on small holdings, confined to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818,
settlement pushed into the prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Daytonâs Road
and Trammelâs Trace (LaGrone 2008). In 1824, Martin Varner was one of the earliest Anglo
residents in the area that would become Wood County, settling southeast of the present-day town
of Hainesville (Gilbreath 2011).
6

For the most part, East Texas was beyond the direct range of the 1835â1836 battles for Texas
independence that took place primarily in South and Central Texas. In 1836, the Texas Republic
was born, but Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood on December 29, 1845, entering
the union as the twenty-eighth state. The majority of the settlers moving into Wood County came
from other Southern states and thus brought with them the southern traditions and way of life.
Although slave ownership was not predominant in Wood County during early settlement years,
by 1850 the county population of 3,963 was approximately 20 percent slave, producing 1,108
bales of cotton. In 1850, Wood County, named after George T. Wood, Texas governor from
1847â1849, was carved from Van Zandt County, and Quitman was selected as county seat
(Gilbreath 2011).
After the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession, since the sympathies
of most of the Anglo-American residents of Texas lay with the South. Wood County supported
the Confederacy, with 70 percent of the vote in favor of secession (Gilbreath 2011). On February
1, 1861, Texas became part of the Confederate States of America (Harper 2009). The defeat of
the Confederacy in 1865 brought about the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old
slave-based plantation system, a distressed economy, and the presence of a Union army of
occupation (Harper 2009).
The East Texas region as a whole began to slowly recover from the worst effects of the Civil War
with the end of Reconstruction in 1873 as the population began to gradually increase and the
railroads arrived in the 1870s. In 1870, Wood County was reduced in size when its western
portion was taken to create Rains County. During the latter quarter of the 1800s and into the
1920s, Wood County remained essentially rural, mirroring its antebellum years, but the
population and the number of farms continued to rise, producing primarily corn and cotton
(Gilbreath 2011). However, the Depression years brought about a decline in the population and
rise in unemployment, with 13 percent on public relief by 1940 as residents moved elsewhere to
attempt to secure employment. The 1941 discovery of oil eventually brought about positive
changes through oil production, and the arrival of the automobile encouraged road paving and
movement from a strictly agricultural base. As a result, the nonagricultural economy slowly grew
as manufacturing, retail trade, and service industry-related enterprises provided expanded
opportunities (Gilbreath 2011). By the 1980s, the tourism industry, associated with special
county events and several recreational lakes, and light-scale manufacturing had begun
supplanting the oil and cattle industries (Gilbreath 2011).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODOLOGY
The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites along with important architectural resources located within the
SASI Ranch #7 project area. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in
mind:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)

7

The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background and archival research,
intensive pedestrian survey, and excavations undertaken using the field methods described in this
section. The second goal consists of assessment and evaluation based on National Register
criteria defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Â§60.4 (National Park Service 1990).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
To determine previous cultural resources survey efforts as well as the locations of previously
recorded historic or archeological resources in the project area, the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas online database maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) was consulted.
Review of THC records indicated that one previous cultural resources survey has been conducted
within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area. The survey, conducted by Timothy Perttula for
the THC in 1988, encompassed an area east of the proposed project area around the Woldert site
(41WD333), an eighteenth-century site that has yielded French artifacts (Perttula and Skiles
1989). Numerous sites were recorded in the vicinity of 41WD333 during that survey effort, with
seven of those sites located within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the SASI Ranch #7 project area.
Unfortunately, little information regarding many of the sites is available in the THC database
(Table 3). None of these previously recorded sites is in the immediate vicinity of the proposed
project area and none will be adversely affected by the construction of the SASI Ranch #7
infrastructure.

Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of
historic-era structural resources existing within the proposed project area. These sources include
topographic maps (which often record cultural resources such as cemeteries, houses, and related
features) and aerial photography. Based on a review of these historic records and previously
recorded archeological site locations, it is evident that the region in general has experienced a
dynamic history. Evaluating these sources with more recent records, however, indicates that the
substantial development has occurred in recent years, altering much of the historic landscape.
Furthermore, cross-referencing the locations of nearby previously recorded cultural resources
with geomorphic features such as landforms and soils suggests that prehistoric occupation of the
area was typically confined to upland escarpments and prominent point bar and natural levee
landforms near Lake Fork Creek. Historic period habitation within the region was minimal
8

during the nineteenth century. Settlement increased markedly during the twentieth century;
however, no records of historic period settlement within the Lake Fork Creek floodplain were
encountered.

METHODOLOGY

Survey Methods
Based on the background and archival research conducted, it was determined that the proposed
SASI Ranch #7 project area had a low probability of containing cultural materials based on the
frequent flooding of the floodplain setting and very slowly permeable soils that it occupies.
Given the amount of groundcover and the nature of archeological sites in the region, it was
assumed that ground visibility in the project area would not be conducive to visual inspection and
that subsurface excavation via shovel testing would be necessary to adequately survey the area.
Shovel tests consisted of hand-excavated units 30â40 cm (11.8â15.7 in) in diameter excavated in
20-cm (7.9-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh
screen to recover artifacts. The location of each shovel test was recorded with a submeteraccurate TrimbleÂ® GeoXTâ¢ global positioning system (GPS) unit, and the exposed soil profile
documented. Each shovel test was backfilled upon completion of the recording process.

SURVEY RESULTS
This section presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the
proposed SASI Ranch #7 project on cultural resources in the vicinity. Management
considerations and recommendations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the
final section.

BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS
Review of THC records indicated that one previous cultural resources investigation has been
conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area, and seven previously recorded sites
are located within the search radius. Archival research focused on the historic period settlement
in the immediate vicinity of the project area. No historic period resources are indicated at the
proposed SASI Ranch #7 location on either the 1960 United States Geological Survey 7.5-minute
(1:24,000-scale) Mineola or Hainesville topographic quadrangles. A review of historic aerial
photography indicates that little development, aside from recent oil and gas development, has
occurred in the vicinity of the project area in the mid-to-late-twentieth century.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
The proposed SASI Ranch #7 project area was intensively investigated to determine the presence
of cultural resources using a combined technique of systematic visual reconnaissance and the
excavation of screened shovel tests. Approximately 9 acres were investigated, with 14 shovel
tests excavated as part of this cultural resources survey (Figure 3).
9

The SASI Ranch #7 project area occupies the floodplain of Lake Fork Creek and is surrounded by
a mixed hardwood forest. The proposed project area has recently been clear-cut of timber
(Figures 4 and 5), which has resulted in ground surface disturbance in some areas. Groundcover,
which had previously consisted of leaf litter, was largely removed yielding ground surface
visibility of 50 percent or greater in most areas. The topography is nearly level, with little
topographic variation across the area. Several localized areas in and immediately adjacent to the
proposed project area were inundated at the time of survey. In general, soil profiles exposed
within shovel tests consisted of a thin (approximately 12 cm [5 in]) A horizon that ranged from
very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam often with grayish brown (10YR 5/2) to
dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) mottles over a B horizon of brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay loam with
strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles (Table 4). A single shovel test (ST 3; see Figure 3)
encountered a sandy mantle of brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam overlying a strong brown
(7.5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam.

Soils encountered within the project area reflect the gradual accumulation of fine sediments
within an active floodplain of Lake Fork Creek. These soils are somewhat poorly drained,
moderately to very slowly permeable, and are subjected to frequent flooding. This area is not
likely to have attracted human habitation during the either the prehistoric period or the historic
period. No artifacts were encountered on the surface or in any excavations within the proposed
SASI Ranch #7 project area. This cultural resources survey encountered no cultural resources, as
defined under 36 CFR 60.4. The area affected by the proposed SASI Ranch #7 project holds a
very low probability of containing significant cultural resources.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This cultural resources survey was conducted to document and assess cultural resources within
the proposed SASI Ranch #7 project area and to provide adequate and relevant information for
use in the management of cultural resources within the project area. Although there are seven
previously recorded archeological sites within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project area, none will be
adversely affected by the proposed project. All shovel tests within the proposed project area were
found to be negative for artifacts and other cultural materials. No historic properties as defined
under 36 CFR 60.4 were identified during this cultural resources investigation of the project area.
The area affected by the SASI Ranch #7 project holds a very low probability of containing
significant cultural resources given the frequently flooded nature of this portion of the Lake Fork
Creek floodplain and the poor drainage and very slow permeability of the soils that have
developed there.
Based on the results of this survey, there is a very low potential for deposits containing
archeological materials within the proposed project area. Given the lack of cultural resources in
the project area, it is recommended that the proposed construction will not adversely affect any
significant cultural resources. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2), it is recommended that no
further cultural resources investigation is necessary. Consequently, it is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed. However, in the unlikely event that evidence of
archeological deposits is encountered during construction, it is recommended that work in the
immediate area immediately cease and representatives of the THC and the USACE-SWL are
contacted and made aware of the inadvertent discovery.
