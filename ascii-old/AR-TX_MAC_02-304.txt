ABSTRACT

Between April 24 – May 5, 2001 crewmembers of Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.
conducted a pedestrian survey of George Park, at the request of Glen Gilmore, City Manager
of the City of Richmond. The survey covered 50 percent of the Project Area, an estimate of
116 acres out of 232.7 acres, and was authorized by the City of Richmond as a prerequisite
for a proposed jogging track in George Park. The purpose of the investigation was to
determine, through the systematic excavation of shovel tests during a pedestrian survey,
whether potentially significant archeological deposits existed within the Project Area as well
as to revisit prerecorded site 41FB188. A total of 124 shovel tests were performed, 14 of
these yielded positive results. Site 41FB188 was revisited and found to be intact. It is
concluded that the paving of a jogging track will not have an impact on 41FB188, although
any future subsurface construction will require the attention of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC). During the survey a new site, 41FB283, was identified and recorded
and it is recommended that no construction take place in the 20 meter radial that defines this
site, the arbitrary center being a flagstone well. Further testing for 41FB283 is not necessary
unless it is to be directly impacted by future development. Artifacts for this site are curated
with TARL. Aside from the aforementioned, no intact, potentially significant archeological
deposits were encountered in the George Park project area and no further cultural resource
investigations are recommended. In the event any archeological remains are discovered
during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity of the discovery and the
Archeology Division of the THC should be contacted.

INTRODUCTION

Between April 24 and May 5, 2001 Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. conducted a
cultural resource investigation under the supervision of Kelly Schexnayder, Judy Kenworthy,
John Vivona, Phil Bishop and Douglas Mangum at the request of the City of Richmond, Fort
Bend County. The Project Area encompasses George Park, the boundary to the south marked
by the Collins Road entry and to the north by the Brazos River. The investigation included
the existing 217.7-acre park plus the recent addition of a 15-acre tract. The study area is
depicted on the Richmond, TX USGS quadrangle map (Figure 2).
Prior to the investigation, site records on file at the Texas Archaeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) were examined to determine whether previously recorded sites existed in
the Project Area. It was found that one recorded historical site (41FB188) is located on the
south bluff of the Brazos River. The subsequent field investigation of Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc. revealed the site to be intact.
The report to follow provides a greater detail for background, descriptions,
interpretations, and recommendations. Report sections address the environmental setting,
previous archeological investigations, and the culture history of the Project Area.

The

research design and methods are then introduced followed by the results of the investigation
and recommendations for the project.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Physiography
Located less than a mile north of the historic district in Richmond, George Park consists of
232.7 acres that stretch south from the Brazos River and is bounded on either side by property
fence lines. This south bank of the Brazos River is delineated by a scarp which drops sharply
about 7 meters to a terrace below. An access road at the western end of the bluff facilitates
entry onto the terrace. The entrance to George Park is Collins Road, which runs due north
from Richmond. George Park is presently partially developed with baseball, football, and
soccer fields in the central to northern sections as well as parking lots and picnic areas.
Undeveloped, heavily wooded areas occupy the southern section of the George Park project
area and to a lesser degree, the river terrace. The recently acquired 15-acre tract, which lies to
the southwest of the Project Area, is a cleared field scattered with huisache.
This region of the Brazos River, north of Richmond, lies in the central province of Fort
Bend County and is a meander belt of the modern Brazos alluvial plain, which was formed
during the last 5000 years (Bernard et al. 1970:3). This area has been subject to episodes of
severe flooding, at least five such episodes have been recorded in June 1899, April 1900,
December 1913, April 1915, and May 1929. All of these floods were caused by heavy inland
rainfall rather than to the tropical storms that occur along the Texas Coast (Kingston 1983:
141-147). Fort Bend County is part of the Southeast Texas Gulf coastal prairie and marshes, a
region represented by a heavy growth of grass, often supporting a large cattle population, and
heavy alluvial soil.

Soils
The following is a discussion of the soils found in the Project Area. Mapped soils
from the Soil Survey of Fort Bend County, Texas indicate a wide range of soils, consisting
primarily of three types: 1) Sandy alluvial land [Sa] on the Brazos river terrace, 2) Yahola fine
sandy loam [Ya] on the Brazos river bluff and 3) the Miller series [Mb,Mc] in the wooded

4

areas. There also exist smaller areas of dark gray Pledger clay in the 15-acre tract and in some
of the wooded areas, including the location of 41FB283.
The Sandy alluvial land is typically found in the loamy bottomland and is a stratified
mix of sandy, silty, and clayey alluvium in the bends of the Brazos River. Situated on the
lowest part of the flood plain adjacent to the river, the lower areas flood every year while the
higher areas (above 25 feet) are flooded every 10 to 12 years. Typically the sandy and silty
soils occupy the ridges, while the clays and silty clay loams are in the swales. The shovel
tests on the river terrace reflect this. The second primary soil type, the Yahola fine sandy
loam, occurs on natural levees such as the Brazos river bluff and ranges in color from pale
brown to reddish brown. The upper levels consist of a heavier textured sandy loam while the
lower levels are of a finer texture. Also sometimes found in the lower layers of the Yahola is
a dark grayish-brown color which indicate older soils that have been buried by alluvial
sediments. Some of the positive shovel tests along the Brazos bluff did reveal flakes in these
older soils. The third primary soil type is the Miller loam series which consist of reddish
calcareous soils with a heavy clay substratum; the upper stratifications are of reddish-yellow
or reddish-brown loam underlain by reddish-brown clay. This is due to alluvial deposits
overlaying the original clay surface soil. As mentioned before, this series is located in the
wooded areas of the Project Area, the flat floodplain south of the Brazos River.

Flora
The Project Area in Fort Bend County lies near the arbitrary boundary of the
Austroriparian and Texas biotic provinces, as defined by Blair (1950). Forests along the
coastal boundary of these biotic provinces may be generally classified as pine-oak. The
predominant forest species, as cited by Blair (1950:99), include loblolly pine (Pinus taeda),
yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus stellata), and
blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica). Two other plant species common to the Upper Texas
Coast are the Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneiodes) and the palmetto (Sabal glabra).
The clay soils of the Texan province are also common locations for tall-grass prairie.
Blair (1950:100) cites some predominant species of the tall-grass prairie as follows:

5

Agropyron smithii, Andropogon saccharoides, Andropogon scoparitus, Stipa leucotricha, and
Triodia pilosa.
The vegetation within the Project Area of George Park reflects the above-described
flora. The trees of the wooded areas contain young as well as old hardwoods and softwoods
of oak, pine, maple, sycamore, and elm; a stand of older oaks was noted in the vicinity of Site
41FB283. Dense understory consisted of trifoliate orange, witchhazel, grape vine, poison ivy,
and wild grasses. An impenetrable blanket of kudzu carpeted the bank of the Brazos River
while more open areas such as the 15-acre tract consist only of mowed wild grasses and
scattered huisache.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

There is certainly a surplus of sites in Southeast Texas that would be relevant to this
project but for purposes of brevity only a few will be discussed here; these sites were chosen
based on their proximity to the Brazos River and the Project Area. For more information on
sites in Southeast Texas, refer to the Archeological Bibliography for the Southeastern Region
of Texas by William E. Moore.
Site 41FB188
This historical site is within the northeast corner of the George Park Project Area, Fort
Bend County, and was excavated by Joan Few in 1989. Located on a rise along the south
bluff of the Brazos River and designated by a brick cistern as its arbitrary center, this site was
determined to be a homestead of either short occupation and/or low economic level (Few
1989). This conclusion was based on the paucity of artifacts which included brick and mortar
fragments, nails, window glass, and bottle glass. In addition to these materials, ceramics were
collected that made it possible to date the homestead from 1840 to 1900; no other diagnostic
materials were found. As a result of this interpretation, the site was not considered of
historical significance. Based on the similar results of the subsequent investigation, Moore
Archeological Consulting concurs with this decision. At the time of this report, there are no
plans by the City of Richmond, Fort Bend County, for subsurface destruction to this site. A
proposed jogging track is intended to be constructed in the area but it is determined that this
will not affect Site 41FB188.
Site 41FB250
To the west of the Project Area along the west bank of the Brazos River as it curves
south, is a site recorded by Leeland Patterson in 1997. It is a prehistoric site in the Rocky
Falls area, found on the Richmond, TX USGS quadrangle, and is determined to be a Late
Archaic burial and Late Prehistoric campsite. At an earlier time artifacts collected by James
V. Wheeless from the not-yet-named site include two large slate gorgets, miscellaneous dart
points, and two Perdiz arrow points. Upon Patterson’s revisit, bone was also noted. The
extent of the site area is undetermined based on past erosion. The site continues to be
destroyed by erosion today.

7

Site 41FB199 and 41FB200, Cullinan Park
These prehistoric sites were excavated in 1993 by Moore Archeological Consulting and
are located between White Lake and Oyster Creek, an abandoned course of the Brazos River.
They are both listed as State Archeological Landmarks and can be found on the Clodine and
Sugar Land, TX USGS quadrangles. Both sites were determined to be Late Prehistoric based
on the abundant diagnostic material recovered during the testing phase. An example of this
material from Site 41FB199 were ceramics and a single arrow point. A hearth feature from
Site 41FB200 was revealed but not as many diagnostic materials. As a result of these finds,
the Texas Historical Commission entered a Memorandum of Agreement with the Houston
Parks and Recreation Department for data recovery excavations coupled with a preservation
plan for unimpacted portions of the site. For 41FB199, only about 13 percent of the
archeological site was to be impacted by the construction and for 41FB200 only 5 percent was
to be impacted. As the end result, Moore Archeological Consulting was successful in
preserving the majority of the sites in perpetuity.

CULTURE HISTORY OF SOUTHEAST TEXAS

Human occupation of the Upper Texas Coast extends roughly 12,000 years into the
past. The chronological sequencing for the culture history of southeast Texas has been under
development over the past 50 years and there is still considerable debate over the arrangement
of prehistoric chronological sequences. This debate stems largely from the nomenclature and
applications of projectile point typologies (Ensor 1991: 5-6) but also from the scarcity of sites
demonstrating well-defined and deep stratification. Ensor claimed that when dating a site the
possibility of mixed archeological components has to be considered and proposed a sequence
that coincided with other projectile point sequences from other areas of Texas; it is as follows:

Time Period
Paleo-Indian

Dates
10,000-8000 B.C.

Early Archaic

8000-5000 B.C.

Middle Archaic

5000-1000 B.C.

Late Archaic

1000 B.C.-A.D. 400

Early Ceramic

A.D. 400-800

Late Ceramic

A.D. 800-1750

Table 1. Summary of Southeast Texas Chronology (Ensor 1991).

Ensor’s sequence was an alternative to Patterson (1983, 1995), who also defined a
chronological sequence with reference to projectile point typologies. However, Patterson
based his sequence on the assumption that there was a continuity in large-scale behavioral
patterns (Table 2).

Table 2. Summary of Southeast Texas Chronology (after Patterson 1995).

The following culture history is based on Patterson’s chronological sequencing.

Paleo-Indian Period
In North America Paleo-Indian occupation is generally indicated by the presence of
fluted, lanceolate projectile point types, such as the Clovis and Folsom. In Southeast Texas,
Clovis point types have been recovered from surface locations and from a few multicomponent sites (Patterson 1995: 250), but not from secured stratigraphic deposits. Because
of this and the lack of radiocarbon dating in this region, the Paleo-Indian period in Southeast
Texas is not well defined.

Archaic Period
The Archaic sequence in Southeast Texas is generally defined as that time between the
disappearance of the Pleistocene megafauna and the introduction of ceramics. The Archaic
sequence is subdivided into Early and Middle Archaic periods which were characterized by
increased climatic aridity and the expansion of prairie habitats (Aten 1983: 153). During this
time population densities in Southeast Texas appear to have been low, possibly having
10

decreased from Paleo-Indian times (Moore and Moore 1991: 28). This may have stemmed
from a reduction in available food resources due to the less productive climate. Although
sites from the Early and Middle Archaic are documented along the Upper Texas Coast, they
are rare, and this time period is still poorly defined.
The Late Archaic period, on the other hand, is distinct from the earlier Archaic periods
due to the occurrence of several environmental and cultural phenomena. During this time the
aridity of the climate returned to a more habitable temperature, similar to what it is today, and
this presumably generated a greater variety and availability of food resources (Patterson 1995:
246). Consequently, population densities rose, and this is evidenced by the abundance of Late
Archaic sites in the region. This rise in regional populations may have been facilitated by
long-distance trade, mortuary practices, and technological innovations in projectile point
manufacture, all of which were present during the Late Archaic (Patterson 1995: 247).

Late Prehistoric/Ceramic Period
The final period in Southeast Texas prehistory is generally defined as the time between
the introduction of ceramics (ca. A.D. 100-400) and European contact. In this period there is
evidence of continuously growing population levels which then decline towards the end of the
Late Prehistoric. It is thought that this may be due or at least aggravated by over-population
or an episode of climatic (Patterson 1995: 246).
Ceramics appeared in the Galveston Bay area by about A.D. 100 and were adopted at
inland sites (e.g., Conroe and Livingston areas) by about A.D. 500 (Pettula et al. 1995: 183,
185). Goose Creek, a plain, sand-tempered variety of ceramic was the most prevalent
throughout the Late Prehistoric period (Aten 1983: 231-232) although other decorated
varieties (e.g. incise, stamped, punctuated, and brushed) and tempering agents (e.g. grog and
bone) were also present (Patterson 1995: 258; Pettula et al. 1995: 186). Caddoan pottery
appears in Southeast Texas at approximately A.D. 1000-1300 and again later A.D. 1500,
signaling the use of extended trade networks or possible migrations (Aten 1983: 295).

11

Historic Indian Period
Due to the paucity of non-European diagnostic artifacts for protohistoric and historic
sites, this period of aboriginal occupation of Southeast Texas is largely underdocumented. As
a result, historic aboriginal sites are most often identified by the presence of European trade
goods. Without these it is very difficult to define historic occupation. For the most part,
European settlement did not disrupt aboriginal habitation of the Upper Texas Coast until after
1700 (Patterson 1995:249).

METHODS OF ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION

Prior to fieldwork, maps of the George Park project area were examined and
previously recorded sites in the area were researched. The survey methodology for the
fieldwork consisted of a pedestrian survey that included systematic shovel testing as well as
an examination for surface exposure of cultural remains. The survey covered approximately
50 percent of George Park, totaling an estimate of 116 acres out of 232.7 acres. This was due
to the other 50 percent of George Park already having been developed into athletic fields at
an earlier time. The shovel tests were organized into transects that either ran in parallel lines
or followed the geomorphology.

Certain areas that were boggy, overtly disturbed, or

impenetrable were not shovel tested. In the wooded floodplain region south of the Brazos
River, transects were 30 meters apart and ran eastwest, with a shovel test placed every 100
meters. The crew began these linear transects at the southern boundary of the Project Area;
when approaching the northern edge of this heavily vegetated area, it was necessary to
increase the distance between the transects (Fig. 4). Depths of the shovel tests reached 80
centimeters below surface, or until clay was encountered. Bypassing the athletic fields to the
north of the woods, the Brazos River bluff required more intensive shovel testing due to the
higher probability of prehistoric cultural remains. Following the river bluff, shovel tests
were placed at 30-meter intervals, including the area of prerecorded site 41FB188 (Fig. 3),
with depths averaging 100 centimeters below surface. Where possible, the river bank profile
was observed for stratigraphy, which reflected the same soils found in the shovel tests on the
bluff (Yahola fine sandy loam). The soil of the river terrace proved to be of recent deposit
and although investigated, did not require as many shovel tests. Whenever positive shovel
tests were encountered, radial tests were placed at 3-5 meter intervals around each one until
they yielded negative results.

13

SURVEY RESULTS

The intensive pedestrian survey was conducted over 5 working days, between April
24 and May 10, 2001; progress was slow due to extremely dense trifoliate orange in the
wooded regions. A total of 124 shovel tests were performed, fourteen of which were
positive. All areas of George Park that were accessible and/or undisturbed were surveyed;
the developed athletic fields were considered disturbed and therefore not tested.
Other areas of disturbance include a borrow pit located down on the terrace, the 15acre tract which appears to have been plowed, and the western portion of the Brazos River
bluff. This area, which is abutted by an athletic field, appeared to have been modified due to
the unusual stratification and color of soil that differed drastically from the eastern portion of
the river bluff. The crew’s suspicion was confirmed when the park supervisor informed us
that this section of the park had once been a leaching field for waste. In the wooded areas of
the southern section of the Project Area, pockets of modern dumping were indicated by
surface refuse; in one such area to the southeast, a brick and mortar shallow “basin” was
discovered. The basin measured approximately 3 feet deep and 2 feet wide and was filled
with bottles dating ca. 1920 to recent. The area was shovel tested with negative results;
based on these findings and the presence of contemporary refuse in and around the well, no
further investigation is necessary for this feature.
Site 41FB188, located along the Brazos River bluff, was revisited and eight initial
probes were done within its boundaries. Of this eight, three tested positive for both historical
and prehistorical materials, thereby requiring radials. A total of six tests were positive for
this section of the bluff, two of these revealed historic ceramic sherds at 60-70 cmbs; the
other four revealed one chert flake each at 60-100 cmbs. It is established that 41FB188 is
still intact but with a total of only four very small chert flakes and no other findings of
cultural impact, there was not enough evidence of a true prehistoric archeological component
within 41FB188. As a result, the flakes will be treated as isolated finds and will not be
curated at Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). According to the State of
Texas Archeological Site Data Form recorded by Joan Few, 41FB188 is of minimal
archeological importance and was not recommended for further testing. Based on the result
of this survey, Moore Archeological concurs with this conclusion.

14

A new site, 41FB283, was identified in the southwestern portion of the Project Area
(Fig. 5). This site is marked by a flagstone well, which serves as the arbitrary center for the
site. The area around this feature was shovel tested heavily at 5-meter intervals, yielding
eight positive tests that contained subsurface artifacts such as earthenware sherds, brick, glass
and metal. With the exception of one surface find, these materials were encountered at 10- to
40-cm below surface. Only two ceramic sherds, one blue and one purple transferware, can
possibly be dated to before 1870; the other materials remain undiagnostic. The area was
examined and plenty of modern homestead remains were evident. A portion of a modern
concrete pad is located approximately 25 meters due south of the well; remnants of barbedwire fencing with round nails lay strewn in the vicinity. A section of a decorative wroughtiron fencing sat near the concrete pad. Based on the mixed components of possibly pre-1870
remains as well as more recent architectural elements, multiple periods of occupation are
possible. These artifacts are to be curated at TARL.
Further testing for 41FB283 is not necessary unless it is to be directly impacted by
future development; for any plans to develop in the vicinity of the flagstone well it is
recommended that a radial of at least 20 meters around the well not be disturbed. Aside from
the aforementioned, no other cultural or subsurface remains or features were encountered in
the Project Area, therefore Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. does not recommend any
further cultural resource investigations.
