Abstract
Atkins was contracted by Oncor Electric Delivery Company to conduct a cultural resources survey
of the proposed Bluff Creek to Brown Transmission Line Project. Fieldwork on accessible
properties began on July 15, 2010, and the majority of the pedestrian survey was completed by
December 1, 2010. The line extends across Taylor, Runnels, Coleman, and Brown counties, Texas,
for a distance of approximately 137.6 kilometers (km) (85.5 miles). The right of way (ROW) will be
48.8 meters (160 feet) wide. In total, the entire proposed transmission line ROW occupies an area
of approximately 1,658.2 acres (671.0 hectares). Also surveyed were roughly 26 linear km (16
miles) of previous alignments, which have since been superseded by reroutes; these cover an area
of 310 acres (125 hectares). Twenty-six tower locations within floodplains were monitored during
construction, with no cultural materials observed within them.

The survey revisited 3 previously recorded prehistoric sites (41TA23, 41TA26, and 41TA269) and
defined 43 newly recorded sites (41TA285―41TA295, 41RN245―41RN265, and
41CN288―41CN298)—27 prehistoric, 12 historic, and 4 with both prehistoric and historic
components. Sites 41TA288, 41RN247, 41RN263, and 41CN292, whose boundaries have been fully
defined, do not appear eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The eligibility of
each of the other 42 sites cannot be determined at this time as they extend beyond the limits of the
current project area; however, based on the recorded portions of these sites, no additional cultural
resource investigations are recommended within the ROW.

The project operated under a policy of collecting only diagnostic artifacts; these will be returned to
the private landowners once analysis is complete. All project records and photographs will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin.

Management Summary
At the request of Oncor Electric Delivery Company (Oncor), PBS&J (now Atkins) conducted a
cultural resources survey of the proposed Bluff Creek to Brown 345-kV transmission line
connecting the existing Bluff Creek Substation in Taylor County to the existing Brown Substation in
Brown County. In its entirety, the proposed project will extend approximately 137.6 kilometers
(km) (85.5 miles). The right of way (ROW) will be 48.8 meters (160 feet) wide. In total, the entire
proposed transmission line ROW occupies an area of roughly 1,658.2 acres (671.0 hectares).
Results of the survey have already been presented in the form of interim reports covering two
segments of the line, which were surveyed simultaneously, and three addenda in the form of letter
reports. Also surveyed were roughly 26 linear km (16 miles) of previous alignments, which have
since been superseded by reroutes; these cover an area of 310 acres (125 hectares).

Michael Smith served as Principal Investigator. Crew chiefs included Ellen Ledgerwood, Chris
Heiligenstein, Chris Kugler, Ray Tubby, and David Sherman. The field crew consisted variously of
Mark Holderby, Sabrina Arno, Ty Golgoun, Lynne O’Kelly, Barry Dwiggins, John Rucker, Shelly
Fischbeck, Candace Wallace, Michael Nash, Sarah Blake, James Freshwater, Dawn Riggs, Katrina
Miller, David Robinson, and Chris Barry. Fieldwork on accessible properties began on July 15, 2010,
and the majority of the pedestrian survey was completed by December 1, 2010. Survey of
properties heading to condemnation and those on later reroutes were conducted when they
became available, with the last occurring in May 2011. Twenty-six tower locations within
floodplains were monitored during construction by Michael Smith, Russ Shortes, Robert Rowe, and
Ty Golgoun on several occasions ranging from May 13, 2011, to November 18, 2011.

The intensive pedestrian survey traversed the entire project area in two transects due to the width
of the ROW. In all, 5,180 shovel tests were attempted within the proposed ROW in an effort to locate
cultural resource sites. This is an average of approximately 15.8 shovel tests per km per transect
(25.5 per mile per transect), or 2.6 shovel tests per acre of the entire project area. This number
exceeds the minimum number of shovel tests required by the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.

The survey revisited 3 previously recorded sites and documented 43 previously unreported
cultural resource sites. Sites 41TA288, 41RN247, 41RN263, and 41CN292, whose boundaries have
been fully defined, do not appear eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The
eligibility of each of the other 42 sites cannot be determined at this time, as they extend beyond the
limits of the current project area; however, based on the recorded portions of these sites, no
additional cultural resource investigations are recommended within the ROW.

The project operated under a diagnostics-only collection policy; all collected artifacts were
returned to the private landowners. All project records and photographs are curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin.

I. INTRODUCTION
PBS&J (now Atkins) was contracted by Oncor Electric Delivery Company (Oncor) to conduct a
cultural resources survey of the proposed transmission line connecting the Bluff Creek Substation
in Taylor County with the Brown Substation in Brown County, Texas. The line extends across
Taylor, Runnels, Coleman, and Brown counties for a distance of approximately 137.6 kilometers
(km) (85.5 miles) (Figure 1). The right of way (ROW) will be 48.8 meters (m) (160 feet [ft]) wide. In
total, the entire proposed transmission line ROW occupies an area of approximately 1,658.2 acres
(671.0 hectares).

Results of the survey have already been presented in the form of interim reports covering two
segments of the line (Smith 2010, 2011), which were surveyed simultaneously, and three addenda
in the form of letter reports. Also surveyed were roughly 26 linear km (16 miles) of previous
alignments, which have since been superseded by reroutes; these cover an area of 310 acres
(125 hectares). Twenty-six tower locations within floodplains were monitored during construction.

The transmission line will consist of double-circuit V-towers within a 48.8-m (160-ft) ROW. The
ROW will be subjected to mechanized land clearing, vehicular travel, and, to a much lesser areal
extent, construction of tower footings. The mechanized land clearing will impact depths of 15 to
61 centimeters (cm) (6 to 24 inches). The double-circuit V-towers will be 38.1 m (125 ft) high and
have a footprint of about 9 x 4.5 m (30 x 15 ft). Each of the four piers will be 0.6 to 0.8 m (2 to 2.5 ft)
in diameter and will be excavated to depths of approximately 3 to 4.5 m (10 to 15 ft).

This project falls under the Competitive Renewable Energy Zone (CREZ) process, has been
designated as a Critical Constraint Project by the Independent System Operator, and has been
approved by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The current survey was conducted according to
the methods outlined in the generic research design for Oncor projects approved by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) (PBS&J 2008). The cultural resource investigations were performed
in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (PL 89-665), as amended in
1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 91-190, 83 Stat.
915 USC 4231, 1970); the Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR
800); the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979; as well as the guidelines set forth by the
Council of Texas Archeologists and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.

II. PHYSICAL SETTING
PHYSIOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY
The Bluff Creek to Brown transmission line spans southern Taylor County, northeastern Runnels
County, and southern Coleman County and terminates just within the southwestern border of
Brown County. Physiographically, the project area lies within the North‐Central Plains of Texas
(Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG] 1996).

Geologically, at its northern end the project area is underlain by the Lower Cretaceous‐aged
formations of Edwards Limestone, Comanche Peak Limestone, and the Walnut Formation (BEG
1972). These often‐eroded uplands are dissected by numerous tributaries and intermittent
drainages, including the larger Bluff Creek and Elm Creek. This land is used primarily for grazing. In
those areas, vegetation typically consists of sparse grasses, juniper, scrub oak, and mesquite (Figure
2). Shallow soils overlie limestone bedrock, which has been exposed in many areas by erosion, and
cobbles of Edwards chert are ubiquitous on the surface (Banks 1990:59–61). Due to such
accessibility, these chert resources were likely utilized by native peoples over the millennia, as
evidence by lithic manufacturing debris observed widely but thinly spread across the larger
landforms.
The central portion of is relatively level and underlain by the Permian‐aged mudstone, limestone,
dolomite and siltstone of the Clear Fork Group and the limestone and shales of the Wichita‐Albany
Group (BEG 1976). These are overlain in wide areas by recent or Pleistocene Surficial Deposits
Undivided; the latter comprise lag gravels and the sand and clay of “older terrace remnants” and
colluvium (BEG 1976). Holocene alluvium is present within the narrow floodplains of the larger
creeks and drainages. Within these areas, the relatively level terrain has mostly been affected by
either recent or historic agricultural activities, including plowing and terracing. At the time of the
survey, such properties were generally furrowed for crops or left overgrown with grasses for
livestock (Figure 3).

The southeastern third of the project area is dissected by numerous tributaries and intermittent
drainages, including the larger Home, Bull, Hay, and Mukewater creeks, each possessing associated
Holocene alluvial deposits. The undulating terrain of this section is underlain by Permian limestone
and shales to the northwest and, to the southeast, older Pennsylvanian‐aged formations of
mudstone, sandstone, and limestone (BEG 1976). The hillier terrain of this area was similar to that
of the northern end—generally eroded and suitable mainly for grazing, with vegetation typically
consisting of mesquite, cactus, and scattered grasses.

SOILS
The predominant soil series in the project area—Tarrant, Kavett, Talpa, Hamby—formed from
Pennsylvanian, Permian, and Cretaceous limestones, sandstones and clay, and clayey sediment
overlying limestone (Table 1). These are typically shallow upland soils, which have been subjected
to erosion throughout much of the ROW. The majority of the alluvial plains, alluvial plain remnants,
and terraces within the project area consist primarily of ancient soils derived from the former—
Mereta, Miles, and Sagerton. Recent alluvial deposits—Colorado, Gageby, and Frio—are present in
the least quantity.

FLORA

The project area falls mainly within the Rolling Plains and Edwards Plateau Vegetational Areas of
Texas as delineated by Hatch et al. (1990). The Rolling Plains Vegetational Area is bordered by the
Cross Timbers and Prairies Vegetational Area to the east, the Edwards Plateau Vegetational Area to
the south, and the High Plains to the west. The Edwards Plateau Vegetational Area is bordered by
the Cross Timbers and Prairies, Rolling Plains, and High Plains Vegetational Areas to the north and
the Blackland Prairies Vegetational Area to the east.

The Rolling Plains Vegetational Area is the primary vegetation area within the project area covering
portions of Coleman, Runnels, and Taylor counties. The Rolling Plains area is a gently rolling to
moderately rough terrain that historically supported a tall- to mid-grass prairie, but overgrazing
and cessation of wildfires has resulted in retrogression to short-grasses, shrubs and annuals (Hatch
et al. 1990). Important climax vegetation include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big
bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), sand bluestem (Andropogon halli), sideoats grama (Bouteloua
curtipendula), yellow indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), hairy
grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis),
western wheat (Agropyron smithii), shin oak (Quercus sinuata), junipers (Juniperus spp.), and
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa).

The majority of the Edwards Plateau Vegetational Area lies to the south of the project area. The
western half of Coleman County and the southwestern part of Taylor County are considered to be in
the Edwards Plateau (Gould et al. 1960). The Edwards Plateau is a highly dissected plateau that
supports woodlands and shrublands, which are interspersed with pastures dominated by short- to
mid-grasses and forbs (Hatch et al. 1990). Mixed hardwood-juniper woodlands and forests occur on
steep hillsides and in moist canyons, and riparian woodlands are present along larger streams and
rivers. The most important climax vegetation of the Edwards Plateau include switchgrass, several
species of bluestems and gramas, yellow indiangrass, Canada wildrye, mesquite, and buffalograss
(Buchloe dactyloides). The rough, rocky areas typically support a tall or mid-grass understory and a
brush overstory complex made up primarily of live oak (Quercus virginiana), Texas oak (Quercus
texana), shin oak, junipers, and mesquite.

II. Physical Setting

FAUNA
The project area lies within the Kansan Biotic Province, as described by Blair (1950). The Kansan
Biotic Province in Texas extends south and east from the Oklahoma and New Mexico borders,
eventually transitioning to the Chihuahuan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.

Blair’s Kansan Biotic Province represents the grassy plains that extend across northwestern Texas.
These tend to be drier than the Texan province but are still relatively well drained by southeast
trending streams. At least 59 species of mammals have been identified in the Kansan province in
recent times, in addition to 14 lizard species, 31 snakes, 1 land turtle, 14 anurans (frogs and toads),
and 1 urodele (salamander) (Blair 1950). Mammal species that may have been important to
prehistoric and early historic inhabitants for food, shelter, and clothing include American bison
(Bos bison, formerly Bison bison), black‐tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), Audubon’s cottontail
(Sylvilagus audubonii), coyote (Canis latrans), spotted ground squirrel (Citellus spilosoma),
American badger (Taxidea taxus), black‐footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), and various rodents.

III. CULTURAL SETTING
CHRONOLOGY
The project area is part of the Plains Planning Region as delineated by the THC (Mercado‐Allinger et
al. 1996). The cultural history of the region has been developed from archeological and historical
records and can be assigned to four primary chronological and developmental stages: Paleoindian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. These divisions are believed to reflect changes in
subsistence and cultural developments as reflected by the material remains and settlement
patterns.

The known prehistory of the region in which the project area is located is generally assumed to
have commenced with the Paleoindian period. Beginning prior to 10,000 B.C. and continuing to ca.
6500 B.C., the Paleoindian period was a time of climatic changes from the cool, moist climate of the
late Pleistocene to the warmer and drier climate of the Holocene epoch. Subsistence during
Paleoindian times may have been dependent upon hunting now‐extinct fauna including mammoths
and Bison antiquus. It is also believed that hunting was supplemented by the utilization of plants,
small animals, and marine life when available (Bryant and Shafer 1977). The social organization of
the Paleoindian period probably consisted of loosely structured, highly mobile groups composed of
several nuclear families referred to as bands. Temporally diagnostic toolkits associated with the
Paleoindian consist of a variety of finely chipped, sometimes fluted, lanceolate projectile points,
such as the Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, and Firstview types (Willey 1966). Paleoindian sites have
been recorded in Fisher, Briscoe, Lubbock, and Lipscomb counties in the Plains Archeological
Region.
The project area lies in a geographic zone in which Archaic cultural traits from central and west
Texas are present. This period is postulated to extend from approximately 6500 B.C. to A.D. 750 and
is marked by the onset of modern climates marked by a gradual warming. This period reflected
changes in lithic technology, the more intensive exploitation of varied local resources, and a
correspondingly less mobile and larger population. Based on various differences, there is a
tripartite division of the Archaic into Early, Middle, and Late. Primary distinctions between the
three subperiods include distinctive projectile point/knife types and a variation in some of the
economic pursuits. The Early Archaic sites in this region are in areas with reliable water sources
and a diverse subsistence base. Middle Archaic sites are larger, more numerous, and more widely
distributed than those of the Early Archaic. This may be due to an increase in population densities
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976). The presence of burned rock middens at sites that date to the latter part
of this period suggest that subsistence strategies included a greater reliance on vegetal foods
(Prewitt 1985). Although more emphasis was being placed on plants as a food source, hunting was
still a very important aspect of the overall subsistence strategy as is evidenced by the tool kits of the
period. In the rolling plains, bison played a minimal part for Middle Archaic peoples, but during the
100006286/110039

8

III. Cultural Setting
Late Archaic, bison represent an important economic and subsistence focus (Dibble and Lorrain
1968; Hofman et al. 1989; Hughes 1991).

The Late Prehistoric period, from roughly A.D. 750 to European contact, marks a significant change
from the earlier lifeways of the region. Most important is the introduction of the bow and arrow,
which greatly facilitated hunting and may reflect a heavy emphasis on bison hunting (Bos bison). In
general, the aboriginal groups still functioned as nomadic hunters and gatherers, living at the band
level of social organization. Ceramic technology also made its debut during the Late Prehistoric. In
central Texas, the Austin and Toyah phases (Prewitt 1981) are recognized for the Late Prehistoric
period.
Historically, the project area lies in the eighteenth‐ and nineteenth‐century Comancheria, the region
of Comanche dominance (Thurmond et al. 1981). From approximately A.D. 1700, the region’s
population grew to include displaced Lipan Apaches, various bands of Comanches, and, it is
supposed, the remnants of the original bands of hunters and gatherers. The introduction of the
horse and European firearms allowed the Comanches to function as the dominant cultural group
until the late 1870s. By 1880, however, both the Native Americans and the buffalo had been either
forcibly removed from the area or killed, and the land divided into huge ranches. This post‐1870s
period witnessed an increase in Anglo population as a result of ranching and oil production.

Taylor County was established by the Texas legislature in 1858 from parts of Bexar and Travis
counties. Comanches of the Penateka band had arrived in the region in the eighteenth century and
remained in the Taylor County area until the 1870s, when the U.S. Army defeated them. Enough
white settlers had arrived by 1878 for the county to be organized, with the county seat at the
centrally located settlement of Buffalo Gap (Leffler 2011a). By 1880, the county had a population of
917. The early economy was dominated by cattle and sheep ranching, with agriculture limited to
minimal acreage planted in wheat and corn. Settlement in Taylor County increased with the arrival
of the Texas and Pacific Railway in the early 1880s. Within the railroad, the new town of Abilene
developed as a shipping center and replaced Buffalo Gap as county seat in 1883. By 1900, the
county had a population of 6,957 and agriculture, particularly cotton cultivation, replaced ranching
as the most significant element of the local economy (Leffler 2011a). While frequent droughts and
the Great Depression brought difficulties to farmers and ranchers, the county population increased
to 41,023 in 1930. Oil was discovered in 1929 but did not become a significant contributor to the
local economy until the early 1940s.

The area encompassing Runnels County was first inhabited by Native Americans and later Spanish
explorers. The ensuing interactions that would occur between the Native Americans and incoming
settlers, eventually lead to the establishment of Fort Chadbourne just west of the county. The
purpose of the Fort was to provide protection to the traders and stockmen in the area. The Fort
continued operations in various capacities until 1867. While the area had been occupied long
before, Runnels County, however, was not established until 1858 from Bexar and Travis County

III. Cultural Setting
lands. Like Taylor County, ranching and farming have continued to dominate the county’s economy
(Pinkney 2011). Today, manufacturing and the oil and gas industry also drive the economy. Because
of their early history on the Texas Frontier, both Taylor and Runnels County are a part of the Texas
Heritage Trails Program, Texas Fort Trails.

Coleman County was formed in 1858 from parts of Brown and Travis counties. Organization was
completed in 1864, with Camp Colorado serving as the county seat. Camp Colorado was established
in its final location in 1857, 20 miles north of Ned Creek. The county seat was moved in 1876 to the
new, centrally located town of Coleman (Tate 2011). Agriculture dominated the local economy from
the 1880s through the 1920s. Cotton was the major crop of the county, which lead to a boom in
population during the turn of the century. The economy suffered during the 1910s and 1920s due
to a severe drought. The drought became so bad that the City of Coleman had to import water. The
years following the depression of the 1930s saw a stabilization of agriculture and oil production
within the county (Tate 2011).

Brown County itself was created from Lampasas County by the State Legislature in August 1856.
After the original bill was amended to alter the county boundaries, the election of officers was held
at the home of Welcome W. Chandler. Chandler was the first permanent settler in what would
eventually become Brown County having settled on Pecan Bayou, just east of the present-day
Brownwood (Leffler 2011b). The Civil War disrupted Brown County’s major industry, cattle
ranching, when ranchers lost northern markets for their cattle. Area cattlemen instead had to take
their herds to Mexico where they traded for supplies (Kirby and Moir 1976).

BACKGROUND RESEARCH AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

As of the beginning of the project, the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Online (Atlas) listed
307 sites within Taylor County, along with 59 sites in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and 4 State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). Runnels County possesses 265 sites, 4 NRHP
listings, and 3 SALs. A total of 298 sites have been identified within Coleman County, although none
have been listed in the NRHP or designated as SALs. Within Brown County, there are 569 recorded
sites, 6 NRHP-listed properties, and 1 SAL.

Knowledge of the archeology in this area of Taylor and Runnels counties is based primarily on the
various previous investigations associated with the construction of dams and other features within
the Elm Creek Watershed. The majority of these were conducted by Southern Methodist University
in 1977 (Lynott 1978). That survey resulted in the identification of 79 sites, both historic and
prehistoric, the majority of the latter represented as lithic procurement sites. Two of these sites,
41TA23 and 41TA26, extend within the current project ROW, and three, 41TA22, 41TA24, and
41TA25 have been mapped within 30 m (1,000 ft).
More‐recent work has been done by personnel of the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation
Service (USDA, NRCS) and the Center for Environmental Archaeology, Texas A&M University

III. Cultural Setting
(Sanders 1996, 1999, 2006). Archeological investigations were conducted at six known sites in
Runnels County, none of which were determined to possess potential to contribute to the Elm Creek
Archaeological District (Sanders 1996). The same conclusion was made for 19 prehistoric sites later
revisited by NRCS (Sanders 1999). A subsequent NRCS survey located seven previously unrecorded
prehistoric sites along Bluff Creek (Sanders 2006). One of these, 41TA269, is located within the
current project ROW, and two others, 41TA270 and 41TA271, lie within 300 m (1,000) ft.

Site 41TA268, located outside of the current ROW roughly 460 m (1,500 ft) to the west, is a
prehistoric site first identified along Bluff Creek during the 2005 NRCS survey (Sanders 2006).
Based on the survey findings, it was later subjected to NRHP‐testing investigations by McCulloch
Archeological Services LLC, with support from the Natural Resources Conservation Service
(McCulloch et al. 2008). Late Prehistoric arrow points, probable Middle or Late Archaic dart points,
chert scrapers, and metates suggest a campsite that saw multiple occupations over a long period of
time. In addition to the remains of 15 possible burned rock hearths on the surface, the
investigations discovered 2 possible subsurface cooking features. Based on the results of this study,
the site was reported as potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP (McCulloch et al. 2008);
avoidance was recommended and, if that is not possible, more‐extensive archeological excavations.

However, the most intensive studies within Runnels, Coleman, and neighboring Concho counties
have been those performed at the confluence of the Colorado and Concho rivers for the
construction and maintenance of the O.H. Ivie Reservoir, formerly Stacy Reservoir (including, but
not limited to, Freeman and Freeman 1981; Lintz, Trierweiler et al. 1993; Nichols 1981;
Wooldridge and Nichols 1980). The Espey, Huston & Associates survey identified 431 sites within
the three counties, of which 76 percent exhibited only prehistoric components, 14 percent only
historic, and 10 percent both (Freeman and Freeman 1981; Nichols 1981; Wooldridge and Nichols
1980). More‐intensive investigations were conducted on almost 60 of these sites by Mariah
Associates, Inc., in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Earls et al. 1991, 1993; Lintz, Treese et al. 1993a,
1993b).

Additionally, Prewitt and Associates conducted a survey of 51 miles between the O.H. Ivie Reservoir
and the city of Abilene (McWilliams et al. 2000). This survey located 12 prehistoric and 2 historic
sites. All of these were determined to be eroded and disturbed, with none deemed eligible for listing
in the NRHP.

Most recently, PBS&J conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of Oncor’s Central Bluff to Bluff
Creek transmission line (Smith 2011b). This survey identified 12 sites within the project’s 15.4-km
(9.6-mile) length. All were prehistoric sites consisting of lithic scatters limited primarily to the
surface; of these, two possessed surficial historic components, including a demolished house site
and a refuse dump.

IV. METHODS
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the survey were to (1) locate and record all cultural resources that might be
within the proposed ROW; (2) assess their significance and potential eligibility for listing in the
NRHP; and (3) provide site-specific recommendations for additional research, as appropriate.

BACKGROUND RESEARCH AND RECORDS CHECK

A records search was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) of The
University of Texas at Austin, the THC, and on the Atlas. The files at TARL were reviewed for
previously recorded archeological sites within, or close to, the proposed ROW, while at the THC, the
files and maps were examined for NRHP properties and SALs. Reports of previous investigations
within or close to the project area were plotted and reviewed for information on local site types and
conditions. The records search included an intensive examination of the area within 300 m
(1,000 ft) of the proposed ROW. The files of the Local History Program at the THC were also
examined for locations of Official State Historical Markers. The Texas Historic Overlay Project
(Foster et al. 2006) and the online files of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) were
consulted once historic sites were located, in order to refine their chronology. Limited deed
research performed by the land agents of Universal Field Services was also provided for the
properties possessing historic sites.
Subsequent to the survey, project historians initiated attempts to contact landowners associated
with parcels containing historic period archeological sites. When available, historians
supplemented landowner-provided histories through deed, probate, and other vital records
research at the Runnels and Coleman County courthouses for the period of occupation suggested by
the archeological evidence. Historians then conducted population census and other secondary
research in attempts to associate particular occupants with specific archeological sites and to
determine whether potential occupants were significant to local or regional development. For most
sites, historians were able to provide a summary of potential occupants, though several may have
been associated with unidentified tenants during the historic period.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY

The survey area is situated within the Central Texas region as regards to methodology defined by
the Oncor Generic Research Design (PBS&J 2008). The field methodology approved by the THC
called for the proposed ROW to be stratified into high probability areas (HPAs), moderate
probability areas (MPAs), and low probability areas (LPAs) on the basis of perceived likelihood for
the occurrence of unidentified cultural resource properties. HPAs were defined as possessing the
greatest potential for containing prehistoric cultural resource properties; site integrity was also
100006286/110039

12

IV. Methods
presumed to be highest in these areas. HPAs included areas that contain deep soils and lie within
305 m (1,000 ft) of water sources. These included levee remnants and rises within floodplains,
toeslopes, and lower alluvial terraces. HPAs were initially identified prior to the field effort by
examination of aerial photographs and topographical maps and were adjusted during the actual
survey based on microtopography, soil conditions, and the degree of surface erosion or
disturbance. LPAs were defined in the field as areas of very steep slopes (i.e., greater than
45 percent), exposed bedrock, modern development, or extensive ground disturbance, such as mass
wasting, sheet erosion, or vegetation clearance. MPAs were also defined in the field as undisturbed
uplands, undisturbed areas greater than 305 m (1,000 ft) from water sources, and nonbedrock or
undisturbed slopes of greater than 20 percent.
The survey consisted of a pedestrian surface inspection of the proposed ROW, with varying degrees
of shovel testing to locate buried cultural resources or those resources obscured by vegetation.
HPAs were subjected to an intensive pedestrian survey, with a density of shovel tests of
approximately 1 per 30 m (100 ft) of linear ROW. The MPAs of the proposed ROW were subjected
to a walkover to verify surface conditions, with shovel testing conducted at the discretion of the
field archeologists. The LPAs were walked but were not shovel tested.
Shovel tests were at least 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter and were excavated in arbitrary levels not
exceeding 10 cm (4 inches). The vast majority of the shovel tests were excavated to subsoil or to
bedrock. In a few cases, the soils became too compact to excavate, and the shovel tests were
abandoned before reaching the Bt horizon or bedrock. Where soils proved deeper, shovel tests
were taken to a maximum depth of 80 cm (31.5 inches). The fill from each shovel test was screened
through 6.4-millimeter (0.25-inch)-mesh hardware cloth when possible. Soils with high clay
content were sorted by hand. The depth of each shovel test was recorded on a shovel test form,
along with a description of the sediments present, the general environmental setting of the shovel
test, its Global Positioning System (GPS) location, any artifacts that were present, and any
additional comments. Only diagnostic artifacts were collected. Each shovel test was completely
backfilled upon completion, along with all nondiagnostic artifacts. In areas where shovel tests were
impossible due to lack of soils or impractical due to planted fields or disturbance, GPS points were
also taken along with notes to record area conditions.

SITE RECORDING

Once a cultural resource site was located, a program of systematic shovel tests was implemented to
help define the site’s horizontal and vertical boundaries within the proposed ROW, and to provide
information on the potential integrity of the cultural deposits. Where appropriate, site boundaries
were delineated by surficial extent of artifacts or surface features. In areas where subsurface
deposits were identified, site boundaries were defined by a series of shovel tests within the ROW
along transects parallel to the ROW corridor. Generally, shovel tests were placed at intervals of
15 m (49.2 ft), with two consecutive negative shovel tests confirming the site’s outer margins. Once
100006286/110039

13

IV. Methods
an archeological site was identified, its location was recorded using a GPS unit and noted on a U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute quadrangle map. A sketch map of the site was drawn, showing
the location of all shovel tests and other salient features, and the area was photographed with a
digital camera. All of the artifacts recovered from the shovel tests were described on shovel test
forms; representative samples were photographed and/or sketched. The range of variability of any
observed surface artifacts was described in field notes, with photographs taken and/or sketches
made of selected artifacts representative of the site. After examination and recording, all
nondiagnostic artifacts found within shovel tests were reburied, and nondiagnostic surface artifacts
were left where they were found. Temporally diagnostic artifacts were collected and returned to
the PBS&J laboratory for analysis; these were returned to the individual property owners upon
completion. A temporary field designation was assigned to each site, and a TexSite form
subsequently was completed and submitted to TARL for assignment of a permanent trinomial
designation.

MECHANICAL TRENCHING

Although mechanical trenching is typically used to investigate Holocene-aged alluvial settings for
potential sites buried beneath the reach of hand excavation, it was not employed during the Bluff
Creek to Brown survey due to engineering concerns, as detailed within the THC-approved generic
research design for Oncor projects (PBS&J 2008). The excavation of one or more backhoe trenches
at a proposed structure location would be destabilizing in regard to construction of the tower
structures since undisturbed soil is necessary to support the structure foundations. Instead, in
accordance with the approved generic research design, monitoring was conducted for the drilling of
all structure locations within Holocene floodplains. The presence of the floodplains of several
creeks within the ROW required the monitoring of 26 tower locations.

MONITORING

The construction of 26 new transmission structures was monitored within the project’s various
floodplains. Monitoring involved the examination of the soil as it was removed from the foundation
holes of each structure in order to identify any cultural remains that might have been disturbed by
the construction. When possible, the profiles of the foundation holes were examined for the
presence of visible cultural features, though observation was limited by the narrow diameter of the
holes and the interests of safety. All observations were recorded, including soil color, texture, and
type, and depth from surface.

V. RESULTS
PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
The cultural resources survey of the Bluff Creek to Brown Transmission Line was conducted at
various times between July 15, 2010, and December 1, 2010, depending on access; additional small
reroutes were surveyed up until May 2011. The intensive pedestrian survey traversed the entire
proposed line in two transects due to the width of the ROW. The survey documented revisited 3
previously recorded sites and identified 11 new sites in Taylor County, 21 previously unreported
cultural resource sites in Runnels County, and 11 previously unrecorded sites in Coleman County.
Probability areas were modified in the field at the discretion of the crew leaders based on
considerations of topography, disturbances, slopes, and other such factors (Figure 4). Roughly
25 percent was determined to be HPAs, 74 percent to be MPAs, and 1 percent to be LPAs (see
Figure 4). Archeologists attempted 5,180 shovel tests or probes, averaging 25.5 shovel tests per
transect per linear mile. This number exceeds the THC Minimum Survey Standards of 16 per mile.

41TA23 Revisit

Site 41TA23 is a prehistoric site first recorded during the 1977 SMU survey (Lynott 1978). It is
depicted on the Atlas as occupying the floodplain immediately west of Bluff Creek within soils
mapped as Gageby clay loam (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service [USDA, SCS]
1976). This places it within an area mapped as a HPA. Vegetation at the time of the current survey
consisted of dense junipers, short grasses, and prickly pears. A road has been bulldozed parallel to a
north-south fenceline at the eastern edge of the Bluff Creek to Brown ROW, and push piles can be
seen within the woods (see Figure 4). The site’s northern margin has been heavily impacted by
extensive recent modifications to Bluff Creek (Figure 5).

Site 41TA23 was originally described by the SMU recorders as “a series of short term camps and
chipping stations” (Atlas). Observed artifacts included lithic debitage and broken tools; the
presence of hearths was noted, as well as a “stone rectangle.” No photos or additional information
were available from TARL. As plotted on the Atlas, the majority of the site was located east of the
current ROW, covering an area of roughly 300 m (984 ft) northwest-southeast by 200 m (656 ft)
northeast-southwest.

PBS&J relocated the site by the presence of lithic debitage scattered thinly on the ground surface in
a density of roughly 1 piece per 10 square meters (m2) (108 square feet [ft2]). Based on the extent
of these artifacts and subsurface testing during the current investigation, the portion of the site
within the ROW measures roughly 40 m (131 ft) north-south by 30 m (100 ft) east-west (Figure 6).
Of eight shovel tests placed to define the vertical and horizontal extent of the site, three went to
depth (over 80 cm) in sandy loams. Two of those were positive, containing a total of three flakes, all

Although site 41TA23 was originally described as having “lots” of research potential, the recent
revisit did not find evidence to support this. The area has been greatly disturbed by previous
mechanical clearing and work associated with the various Elm Creek Watershed projects. While the
eligibility of site 41TA23 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that
lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41TA26 Revisit

Site 41TA26 is a prehistoric site recorded by SMU in 1977 as a primarily surficial lithic scatter
located in the floodplain west of Bluff Creek (Lynott 1978). This area is subsequently categorized as
an HPA. Soils mapped in the area of the site are classified as Gageby clay loam, which formed in
alluvium on relatively level to gently sloping floodplains (USDA, SCS 1976). Vegetation at the time
of the survey consisted of dense junipers and low grasses; this may be secondary growth following
earlier clearing noted at the time of site discovery (Atlas). A road has been bulldozed, possibly
recently, along a fenceline at the eastern margin of the site.

According to the original site form, site 41TA26 was already heavily disturbed at the time of
discovery. Most of the cultural material, comprising roughly 20 chert flakes and 1 biface, was found
on the surface in the road and disturbance from associated well pads. During the current revisit,
PBS&J personnel placed 18 shovel tests over a roughly 300-m (1,000-ft) length of ROW. Three
shovel tests produced small numbers of chert tertiary flakes and shatter (Table 3), with the deepest
occurring at a depth of up to 50 cm (20 inches). These tests occurred within the middle of a light
surface lithic scatter of over 30 chert flakes and 10 chert cores and tested cobbles. Based on the
extent of observed surface material, the site measures roughly 50 m north-south by 50 m east-west,

No temporally diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were observed during either the original
recording of the site or the current revisit. While the eligibility of site 41TA26 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

41TA269 Revisit

Site 41TA269 is an upland lithic scatter, which was originally recorded in 2006 by the USDA, NRCS
for the Elm Creek (1250) Watershed Project (Sanders 2006); the site was relocated during the
current survey. The site occupies the crest of a gravel knoll at 652 m (2,140 ft) above mean sea level
(amsl), roughly 50 m (164 ft) east of a small feeder to Bluff Creek, in an area mapped as an HPA.
Soils at the site have been mapped as the gravelly loam of the Pitzer-Weymouth Complex, 1 to
5 percent slopes (USDA, SCS 1976). Wind and water erosion have exposed limestone and caliche,
and mixed grasses occupy the infrequent pockets of shallow soil deposition. Surface visibility at the
time of the survey averaged 60 percent. The area has also been cleared of brush and likely
bulldozed at some point in its past.

V. Results
The site was first identified as a lithic procurement site represented by a “thin scatter” of flakes,
cores, and tested cobbles (Atlas). Based on the extent of the surface scatter, the site was previously
recorded as measuring about 100 m (328 ft) east-west by 75 m (246 ft) north-south. The current
investigations observed artifacts on the surface within the reported site boundaries as mapped on
the Atlas, as well as extending approximately 20 m (66 ft) to the north within the current ROW
(Figure 8). Artifact density was low, ranging 1 per 5–10 m2 (54–108 ft2). Six shovel tests placed to
define the horizontal and vertical extent of the site were all negative for cultural materials.
Site 41TA269 is a prehistoric lithic scatter, whose archeological integrity has likely been
compromised by mechanical disturbance. No diagnostic artifacts or features were observed. The
current investigations have extended the site limits only slightly within the ROW. While the
eligibility of site 41TA269 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that
lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41TA285

Site 41TA285 represents a prehistoric open-air campsite, as suggested by a wide scatter of lithic
debris observed on the surface. The site is located on a low terrace above a small tributary to Bluff
Creek, roughly 30 m (100 ft) to the north; this area is defined as an HPA. Soils are mapped as
belonging to the Pitzer-Weymouth complex, 1 to 5 percent slopes, which consist mainly of a shallow
layer of gravelly loam over indurated caliche (USDA, SCS 1976). The surface is eroded, with
limestone outcropping along the northwestern and northern slopes down to the drainage. Junipers,
scrub oaks, and low grasses form the primary vegetation; these yielded surface visibility of roughly
60 percent at the time of the survey. A modern barbed-wire fence runs east-west across the
northern limit of the site, and a bulldozed road crosses the site near its southern terminus.

Due to the shallow soils, the site is limited primarily to the surface, with only 1 of 11 shovel tests
yielding cultural materials to a depth of 15 cm (6 inches) below surface before terminating in clay
(Table 4). The site measures roughly 120 m (394 ft) north-south, based on the landform and extent
of the surface manifestations (Figure 9). The site spans the entire 50-m (164-ft)-wide ROW from
east to west, and extends beyond those boundaries in both directions. The site is represented by a
thin scatter of lithic debitage, averaging about one piece per square meter, with some scattered
concentrations of slightly higher density. The majority of the debitage is of a white chert, with
secondary and tertiary flakes between 1 and 6 cm in length predominating.

It is likely that site 41TA285 was a temporary encampment, taking advantage of the drainage when
water was present. However, no evidence of cultural features or temporally diagnostic artifacts was
observed. Soil depth was shallow, preventing significant deposition within which intact
archeological surfaces could be found. While the eligibility of site 41TA285 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

41TA286

Site 41TA286 is a prehistoric lithic scatter. It is situated on a low, level upland rise between
tributaries of Bluff Creek, approximately 430 m (1,411 ft) to the west and 350 m (1,148 ft) to the
east. Due to the distance from a reliable water source, the site area is considered to be an MPA. The
site is located in a light scatter of secondary juniper and surrounded by dense juniper along the site
boundaries. This location may have been bulldozed and cleared previously. Soils in the area have
been mapped as Hamby fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; these soils typically consist of
shallow fine sandy loam overlying clay at a depth averaging 25.4 cm (10 inches). Stands of junipers
in varying density cross the site, but surface visibility was good, averaging above 80 percent.
Modern impacts to the site include a bulldozed path at its northern end and possible prior
agricultural terracing, as evidenced by periodic low rises and a large plowed field immediately to
the west.

The site consists of a dense surface scatter of over 30 chert cores and 100 pieces of debitage.
Among these were a utilized flake and a thick biface, possibly used as a chopper. Based on surface
observation, shovel testing, and ROW boundaries, the site is approximately 40 m (131 ft) northsouth by 60 m (197 ft) east-west (Figure 10); the latter measurement is due to a later shift in ROW
alignment. It is likely that the site may extend farther to both the east and west. Of the eight shovel
tests placed across the site to determine vertical extent, four proved positive for cultural materials,
totaling 20 chert flakes and 4 cores (Table 5); all subsurface material was found within the upper
40 cm (15.7 inches) of sandy loam.

Site 41TA286 appears to have been a locale for the procurement and basic working of chert
materials, although the presence of expedient tools suggests that other activities may have
occurred. However, any further determination of the site’s original function is precluded by the lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts, shallow soils, modern disturbance, and the lack of features. While
the eligibility of site 41TA286 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site
that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41TA287
Site 41TA287 consists of a light surface scatter of lithic debitage. It lies on a gentle upland slope
approximately 400 m (1,312 ft) to the southwest of Salt Branch, an intermittent stream. The site is
thus located in an area considered to be an MPA. Local soils are mapped as Pitzer gravelly loam, 1 to
8 percent slopes (USDA, SCS 1976). It is now vegetated by mesquite, juniper, and some low grasses.
The site has been used in modern times as a gravel quarry, which has resulted in severe
disturbance to the site and compromised any integrity it may once have had (Figure 11). Further,
the site has since been used as a trash dump, as evidenced by large refuse piles to the northeast and
east.

Chert gravels and caliche are ubiquitous on the surface amid large pits and berms. Most of the chert
appears to have been fragmented or spalled by heavy machinery, rendering it difficult to
distinguish the prehistoric manufacturing debris. Artifacts observed on the surface included three
first-stage bifaces, cores, and up to 20 flakes of all stages of manufacture. No shovel tests were
excavated due to the lack of soil and high degree of disturbance. Based on the extent of the surface
scatter, the site measures about 60 m (197 ft) north-south, and extends the 50 m (164 ft) of the
ROW from west to east and continues outside the site boundaries (Figure 12).

Site 41TA287 most likely represents a lithic procurement site, but no diagnostic materials or
features were observed that could further clarify its function. It has also suffered a high degree of
surface modification from quarrying activities. While the eligibility of site 41TA287 as a whole
cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not
appear to merit additional investigation.

41TA288

Site 41TA288 is a prehistoric lithic scatter situated along the crest of an upland ridge at an elevation
of 738 m (2,420 ft) amsl. The nearest observable water source is a small, intermittent tributary of
Bluff Creek, 650 m (2,133 ft) to the southeast, placing the site in an area mapped as an MPA. Soils in
the area are mapped as belonging to the Tarrant-Kavett association, undulating (USDA, SCS 1976),
which consists of cobbly clay shallowly overlying limestone. Ground surface visibility at the time of
the survey was generally high due to the surface cobbles and exposed bedrock, but ranged from 40
to 75 percent within patches of low grasses, scrub oak, and junipers.

100006286/110039

27

V. Results
Site 41TA288 is a surface concentration of lithics distinguished by a higher density of chert flakes
(one per square meter [11 square ft]) than generally found along the landform (1 per 100 m2
[1,076 ft2]), as well as by the presence of chert tools. Based on surface observation, the site is
limited to a small area, roughly 10 m (33 ft) in diameter (Figure 13); no shovel tests were placed
due to the lack of soils. Chert artifacts observed at the site included 1 thin biface (Figure 14), 1
scraper, a core, and roughly 10 flakes.

Figure 13. Chert biface from site 41TA288
Due to the distance from a viable water source, it is likely that site 41TA288 represents a temporary
campsite where tools were manufactured from the ample local resources. Because of the sparse
nature of the cultural materials, the lack of soil depth, and the lack of associated features, site
41TA288 does not appear to be eligible for listing in the NRHP, and further investigation of the
portion of the site within the ROW is thought to be unnecessary.

41TA289
Site 41TA289 is a prehistoric site located on a relatively level portion of a long ridge top, which
slopes steeply to the east. The site lies approximately 500 m (1,640 ft) west of a small intermittent
tributary of Bluff Creek in an area designated as an MPA. The soils are categorized as belonging to
the Tarrant association, undulating (USDA, SCS 1976). Vegetation present at the time of survey
consisted of junipers, low scrub brush, and grasses, which occupied shallow patches of soil between
exposed limestone bedrock. The resulting ground visibility ranged from 30 to 90 percent.

Based on the extent of materials observed on the surface, the site measures roughly 25 m (82 ft)
northeast-southwest and 15 m (49 ft) northwest-southeast (Figure 15). The absence of soils
precluded the need for shovel testing. Chert flakes were scattered thinly across the surface in a
density of roughly 1 per 4 m2 (43 ft2). Present were two possible preforms of brown chert,
measuring between 7 and 10 cm in length, and a large tertiary flake exhibiting some edge
modification, most likely for use as a scraper. Of the chert flakes, the majority were secondary or
tertiary.
Site 41TA289 appears to have been occupied for only a short time, during which the inhabitants
took advantage of the ubiquitous local chert for the manufacture of stone tools. Due to the lack of
soil deposition and stratigraphy, diagnostics, and features, further work at the site does not appear
to offer the potential for additional significant information. While the eligibility of site 41TA289 as a
whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW
does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41TA290

Site 41TA290 represents a thin concentration of lithic debitage located on a low, narrow ridgetop
overlooking Bluff Creek, approximately 70 m (230 ft) to the west (Figure 16). Due to the proximity
to water, this area is considered to be an HPA. The soils in the area are mapped as Ustochrepts—
variable loamy soils formed in calcareous colluvium and Rock outcrop, hilly (USDA, SCS 1976).
Erosion has resulted in a lack of soil deposition, and dense gravels and bedrock form the surface of
the hill. Consequently, surface visibility was very high, though it decreased significantly in the dense
grasses of the surrounding plain. Moderate scrub brush, junipers, and oaks border the hill, while
low grasses occur on the slopes. A modern fenceline runs along the eastern boundary, indicating a
degree of modern disturbance.
Artifacts present included roughly 30 pieces of lithic debitage of all manufacturing stages as well as
less than 10 pieces of burned limestone, some exhibiting crenellated fractures. It was not clear what
percentage of these were related to prehistoric activity or modern clearing. The site occupies the
entire landform, which measures roughly 45 m (148 ft) north-south by 45 m (148 ft) east-west
(Figure 17); it is likely that the site extends eastward beyond the boundaries of the ROW. Shovel

tests were placed to the north and south, but the majority ended at clay or bedrock, suggesting that
the site was confined to the hilltop; only one test, west of the site within the floodplain, encountered
sterile soils to 80 cm (31.5 inches) below surface. No diagnostic artifacts or features were observed.

Site 41TA290 likely represents a short-term prehistoric encampment set to take advantage of both
the naturally occurring chert and the waters of Bluff Creek. However, site integrity is lacking due to
a high degree of soil erosion and possible mechanical clearing. While the eligibility of site 41TA290
as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current
ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41TA291
Site 41TA291 is a prehistoric site consisting of a wide surface scatter of lithic debitage and tools.
The site is located on the eastern slope of a low ridge, which overlooks Salt Branch, approximately
300 m (1,000 ft) to the northeast. This location is categorized as an MPA. The soils have been
mapped as Pitzer gravelly loam (USDA, SCS 1976). Limestone and chert gravels are ubiquitous on
the surface, and erosion has resulted in a paucity of soil deposition. Low mesquite, junipers, and
sparse grasses form the primary vegetation; ground surface visibility at the time of the survey was
high (roughly 80 percent) (Figure 18). Two-track roads run along the eastern margin of the site and
cross its southern margin, exhibiting some modern disturbance.

Figure 18. Overview of site 41TA291, facing north.
Flakes, mainly of the secondary and tertiary stages of manufacture, were distributed across the site
in a density of roughly one artifact per 5 m2 (54 ft2). One preform and two early-stage bifaces were
found at the western edge of the site (Figure 19); no evidence of use wear was visible. Within the
ROW, the site measures approximately 60 (197 ft) m north-south and 30 m (100 ft) east-west
(Figure 20); visual observation suggests that the site extends for an unknown distance west of the
ROW.

Site 41TA291 was likely a lithic procurement area and possible short-term lithic workshop.
Features and temporally diagnostic artifacts were absent. While the eligibility of site 41TA291 as a
whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW
does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41TA292
Site 41TA292 is a surface lithic scatter located on a gentle, eroded slope approximately 50 m
(164 ft) west of a small tributary of Bluff Creek. Due to the proximity of water, the site is designated
as an HPA. Scrub brush and low grasses yielded approximately 25 to 50 percent surface visibility at
the time of the survey. As mapped, the soils belong to the series of Hamby fine sandy loam, 1 to
3 percent slopes, which consist of upland sandy loams formed in calcareous sediments (USDA, SCS
1976).

Site 41TA292 measures roughly 70 m (230 ft) north-south by 40 m (131 ft) east-west (Figure 21),
as determined by surface observation and seven shovel tests, none of which contained cultural
materials. In all of these, sandy loams were found to overlie compact clay loams at depths of up to
40 cm (16 inches) below surface. It is likely that the site continues beyond the ROW’s eastern
margin. Debitage representing all stages of lithic reduction numbered in the hundreds, spread over
the site area at a density of roughly one to four pieces per square meter (11 ft2). One chert drill, a
scraper, and up to 10 bifaces were present. No diagnostic artifacts or features were observed.

The length of the occupation of site 41TA292 cannot be distinguished due to the lack of soil
deposition, diagnostics, or features. The site is restricted to the ground surface and has been
negatively impacted by erosion. While the eligibility of site 41TA292 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

41TA293

Site 41TA293 consists of a light concentration of prehistoric lithic manufacturing debris. The site is
located on a narrow, level bench at the tip of a ridge overlooking a small, intermittent tributary of
Bluff Creek, about 400 m (1,312 ft) to the east. The area is considered an MPA due to the distance
from a reliable water source. Soils are mapped as belonging to the Tarrant-Rock outcrop
association, hilly (USDA, SCS 1976), and limestone cobbles and gravels litter the surface. The area is
heavily eroded, and surface visibility is consequently high (70 to 80 percent). Where shallow soils
do appear over the bedrock, vegetation consists of low grasses, junipers, and scrub oaks. The site is
located just to the south of a cleared two-track road, whose construction by bulldozing has resulted
in heavy disturbance to the site area.
Determined on the visible extent of surface materials and the edges of the landform, the site
measures roughly 20 m (67 ft) north-south and 30 m (100 ft) east-west (Figure 22). The site
appears to extend beyond the western ROW boundary. No shovel tests were excavated due to the
lack of soils (Figure 23). The artifact assemblage comprised one thick early-stage biface, a thinned,
triangular biface fragment (possibly broken during manufacture), and less than 20 pieces of
debitage (10 percent primary, 60 percent secondary, 30 percent tertiary). No diagnostic materials
or features were observed which could be used to date the site.
Site 41TA293 appears to be a lithic procurement site utilizing the surface chert ubiquitous in the
area and possibly a short-term workshop for early-stage lithic reduction. However, it lacks
temporal indicators, stratigraphy, and identifying features. While the eligibility of site 41CN291 as a
whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW
does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41TA294

Site 41TA294 represents a prehistoric lithic procurement site. The site occupies the southern tip of
a high, rocky ridge, roughly 30 m (100 ft) above and 300 m (1,000 ft) west of an intermittent feeder
to Bluff Creek. The soils of the Tarrant association, undulating (USDA, SCS 1976), are mapped
within the site area, though erosion has exposed the bedrock along the slope. Because of the
distance from water and the bedrock exposure, the area is mapped as an MPA. Due to the lack of
soils, surface visibility ranged as high as 90 percent, decreasing only in areas of dense juniper and
scrub oak.

Figure 23. Overview of site 41TA293, facing east.
Site 41TA294 consists of a dense surface concentration of raw and worked chert, roughly 30 m
(100 ft) in diameter (Figure 24). Resting on bedrock amid large fragments of limestone were up to
100 chert cobbles, most of which appeared to be tested (Figure 25). Among these were roughly 30
cores (10 to 15 cm in length) and over 150 pieces of debitage, mainly of primary and secondary
stage of manufacture. All appear to be of the local Edwards chert (Banks 1990).

The site was obviously exploited by native peoples for its abundant and readily available chert, as
evidenced by the numerous tested cobbles and debitage of early manufacturing stage. Because it
lacks soil deposition, temporally diagnostic artifacts, and cultural features, the site lacks the ability
to provide substantial information on the prehistoric lifeways of the region. While the eligibility of
site 41TA294 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within
the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41TA295

Site 41TA295 is a prehistoric site consisting of a wide scatter of chert manufacturing debris. The
site is located on the southern margin of a low ridge, at an elevation of about 695 m (2,280 ft) amsl.
It is approximately 300 m (1,000 ft) and 400 m (1,312 ft), on the west and east, respectively, from
two intermittent drainages feeding Bluff Creek; the site is consequently within a designated MPA.

Figure 25. Overview of site 41TA294, facing northwest.
Soils of the Tarrant association, undulating, predominate (USDA, SCS 1976). The site has been
heavily disturbed by modern modifications, including leveling by heavy machinery and the burning
of uprooted vegetation. At the time of the survey, low grasses and other secondary vegetation were
present, with surface visibility varying between 60 and 90 percent.

The site consists of lithic debitage spread over the surface of the landform at a density of roughly
two to three pieces per square meter (11 ft2) and dissipating along the gentle downward slope at
the site’s southern end, covering a distance of roughly 160 m (525 ft) (Figure 26). Its recorded 50-m
(164-ft) width is based on the ROW boundaries, beyond which the scatter extends to both the east
and west. No shovel tests were placed due to the high degree of disturbance to the shallow soils,
which has erased any possible site integrity (Figure 27). Fragmented chert and limestone litter the
surface, making it difficult to distinguish between knapped, machine-spalled, and heat-spalled
flakes and cobbles. Among the materials identified as culturally modified were tested cobbles and
cores, lithic debitage (secondary and tertiary), and one thick biface.

The site lacks archeological integrity due to extensive modern impacts. While the eligibility of site

41RN245
Site 41RN245 is a prehistoric site represented by a surface scatter of lithics. Bluff Creek lies
approximately 100 m (328 ft) to the northeast of the site, which is located on a slight rise; the site is
thus situated in an area designated as an HPA. The local soils have been categorized as Spur loam,
which typically occurs on the upper parts of floodplains (USDA, SCS 1970). At the time of the
survey, the area consisted of open pasture with low grasses and sparse mesquite (Figure 28),
providing good surface visibility. The site has been affected by erosion and possible clearing, as
evidenced by nearby berms and an adjacent stock pond.

The site is limited primarily to surface expression; of eight shovel tests, only one produced a single
chert flake within the upper 10 cm (4 inches) (Table 6). Based on the range of the surface scatter,
the site is defined as extending roughly 30 m (100 ft) east-west by 60 m (197 ft) north-south
(Figure 29). Chert debitage, comprising cores and flakes of all phases of lithic reduction, was found
in a density of roughly one artifact per 10 m2 (108 ft2) at the northern end of the site and increasing
to one piece for every square meter (11 ft2) at the southern end. Less than 10 fragments of possible
fire-cracked rock were present, but scattered; no intact features were observed.

Site 41RN245 represents at least one prehistoric occupation of unknown origin, and the range of
chert manufacturing debris suggests local lithic procurement activities. No evidence was found of
intact cultural features or subsistence-related activities, and the site produced no temporally
diagnostic artifacts. While the eligibility of site 41RN245 as a whole cannot be determined at this
time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional
investigation. At present, Oncor has rerouted the ROW alignment across this property farther to the
northeast, with the result that the site is not expected to be impacted by construction of the
proposed transmission line.

41RN246
Site 41RN246 represents a possible historic occupation located directly east of a county road in
northern Runnels County. It lies within a plowed field, the soils of which have been mapped as
belonging to the series Rowena clay loam (USDA, SCS 1970). This yielded a very high degree of
surface visibility at the time of the survey. Because the site lies over 300m (1,000 ft) from the
nearest creek, the area is considered to be an MPA.

The site consists of a scatter of domestic debris. Twenty shovel tests, two of which were positive
(Table 7), were placed to determine the site’s horizontal and vertical dimensions, all terminating in
sandy clay below the plow zone at 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 inches) below ground surface. Surface
observation and subsurface testing determined the site’s east-west extent to be roughly 140 m
(459 ft) (Figure 30). Due to a later widening of the ROW, the site measures approximately 50 m
(492 ft) north-south. The historic scatter was widely and thinly distributed across the site due to
continued agricultural activities, in a low density of roughly 1 per 30 m2 (323 ft2). The observed
artifact assemblage comprised roughly 30 fragments of colorless, solarized, milk, and amber glass,
as well as less than 10 ironstone and whiteware sherds.

General highway maps of Runnels County suggest that a residential structure occupied this location
in 1940 (Texas State Highway Department [TSHD]). Though the structure was apparently still
standing in 1961 (TSHD 1961), no traces of it remain today. According to landowner L. Gaston
Ernst, the scatter of domestic debris in this plowed field is most likely associated with the earlytwentieth-century farmstead occupied by Mr. Ernst’s grandparents, Lonnie and Olive Gaston and
their children Lawrence and Geraldine Gaston, mother of L. Gaston Ernst. Mr. Ernst reported that
Lonnie Gaston had settled on this ¼-acre section of land for the purposes of farming and that he
also tended the adjacent 640-acre section of land for his stepfather. The family occupied a wooden
pier-and-beam house on the property where their first two children were born, although Mr. Ernst
could not recall the number and nature of outbuildings. The family reportedly moved to the town of
Winters prior to 1940 where they had two more children (Marie and Robert Gaston). By the 1950s,

100006286/110039

48

V. Results
the old house was barely standing, and the wood was cleared and salvaged later to permit
cultivation of the property (Ernst 2011). Census records indicate that Lonnie K. Gaston, his wife
Olive and children Geraldine, Lawrence, Robert and Marie were living in the incorporated town of
Winters in 1930 (U.S. Federal Census Record 1930 15A:143). The record also indicates that
Geraldine Gaston was 14 years of age in 1930, which suggests she was born around 1916. If
Mr. Ernst’s recollections are correct, that would place the initial occupation of the site around that
time.
No standing structures remain in this area, and any archeological integrity has been erased by years
of agricultural activity. While the eligibility of site 41RN246 as a whole cannot be determined at this
time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional
investigation.

41RN247

Site 41RN247 consists solely of a historic well. The site is located within a tilled grain field, roughly
50 m (492 ft) west of Ranch Road 2405 (Figure 31), in an area mapped as an MPA. Due to the
agricultural modification, surface visibility was roughly 80 percent. The soils within the area are
mapped as Portales clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, which formed on Pleistocene outwash plains
(USDA, SCS 1970).

The well has a superstructure of machine-made red brick covered by cement on its exterior (Figure
32). No inscriptions were present on the well itself to indicate a date of manufacture, and none of
the bricks used in construction displayed a manufacturing stamp. The interior of the superstructure
is not lined with cement, and the bricks are visible extending to depth, which was undetermined.
Surface observation and six shovel tests produced no evidence of other cultural materials.

Historic Research

Site 41RN247 is located on a 157.55-acre tract in the original Houston and Texas Central Railroad
Company Survey (Abstract 640) in Runnels County, Texas. The railroad company patented the
Bexar Scrip grant on May 6, 1903 (Texas General Land Office [GLO] Records, Runnels County
Abstract 312). During the early statehood period, the state of Texas passed several laws pertaining
to the distribution of land to railroad companies. Beginning in 1854, the state offered companies
varying amounts of land for each mile of rail constructed. In 1876, companies received 16 sections
of land per mile and had to “survey an equal amount of land to be set aside for the public school
fund.” In total, railroad companies received certificates for 35,777,038 acres in areas throughout
the state (GLO n.d.2). The fact that the land was granted to the railroad suggests it was undeveloped
during the nineteenth century.

The railroad company conveyed their interest in the 640-acre tract containing site 41RN247 prior
to patenting the survey. In 1900, the company conveyed the entire survey to Guion Gregg, a
resident of Runnels County, for $2,240. The deed described the property as situated along the
“waters of Mulatto Creek,” a tributary of the Colorado River (Runnels County Deed Records
26:505). Gregg purchased another 640-acre tract from the railroad company located along the
same creek on the same day (Runnels County Deed Records 26:501). Though Gregg is described as
a resident of Runnels County in the conveyances, historians were unable to find an entry for him in
contemporary Runnels County census records.

Gregg only retained the property until February of 1901 when he conveyed both tracts to Pauline
Oliver, whom the record references as a resident of Limestone County. Oliver purchased the subject
tract for $3,200 with a vendor’s lien (Runnels County Deed Records 26:595, 597). Gregg’s short
tenure of ownership suggests that he did not live on the property. Subsequent conveyances and
census data suggest that Pauline Oliver relocated to Runnels County after acquiring the property,
and it is possible that she occupied the parcel for a short period. She took out two additional
100006286/110039

52

V. Results
mortgages on various portions of her holdings during the period indicating she could have made
improvements to the property.

In February of 1903, Pauline Oliver, described as a widow, along with D.R. Oliver, M.M. Oliver, and
Sanders and Ida Walker, all residents of Runnels County, took out a lien on 480 acres of the subject
tract, the adjacent 640-acre survey, and an additional 259 acres in Limestone County for $4,000
(Runnels County Deed of Trust Records 6:197). Two years later, Oliver took out another lien for
$2,000 on the 480 acres in the subject survey and another 320 acres, being the southern half of her
other 640-acre railroad survey (Runnels County Deed of Trust Records 6:587). Both liens were
released in 1907 (Runnels County Deed Record 50:529, 610).

Though historians were unable to find an entry for her in the 1910 Runnels County or Texas census
records, Oliver is described as a resident of Runnels County in all of the conveyances. By 1920, she
resided in nearby Winters. Her occupation and age are indecipherable in the record, but her
household included her son Wallace Wallace (32), daughter Gladys Wallace (25), daughter-in-law
Helen Wallace (30), granddaughter Jane Wallace (indecipherable), and son Sherman Wallace
(indecipherable). The record indicates she owned her property. It is possible that Oliver lived on
the property between her acquisition of it in 1901 and her relocation to Winters prior to 1920;
however, she may have also leased out the land to tenants during the period.

Oliver took out two more liens on the subject tract and additional acreage in 1914 and 1917
(Runnels County Deed of Trust Records 17:166; Runnels County Deed Records 94:267) and
retained the property until 1924. In March of 1924, Oliver conveyed 160 acres of the subject survey
containing site 41RN247 to E.R. Middleton for $13,600 with a vendor’s lien. The high price suggests
the tract was improved (Runnels County Deed Records 122:627), though census evidence suggest
that the Middleton family never occupied the parcel.

Ernest R. Middleton, a 34-year-old property owner, resided with his family, including his wife Edith
and their two sons, in Winters in 1920. Though his occupation is indecipherable in the record,
census data from 1910 and 1930 indicate he worked as a physician. By 1930, the family had
relocated to Abilene in Taylor County. In that year, the Middletons occupied a home valued at
$20,000, and their household included a 32-year-old African American servant named Ella Jackson.
Their continued association with urban areas outside of the project area and obvious wealth
suggest the subject parcel was purchased as an investment and that occupants during the period
would have been tenants.
The Middletons retained the property until 1933 when E.R. and Edith Middleton, residents of
Taylor County, transferred the 160-acre tract to H.L. and Belle Chapman. The Chapmans were
described as residents of Runnels County, and they took over the lien due to Pauline Oliver
(Runnels County Deed Records 158:432). The Chapmans resided in the town of Winters in 1930,
and though they could have relocated to the subject tract after purchasing it 3 years later, census
100006286/110039

53

V. Results
records from that year indicate H.L. Chapman (67) was retired and occupied a $6,000 home he
owned. His household included his wife Belle E. (64) and their 10-year-old grandson David H. The
family had lived in Winters since at least 1910 suggesting that tenants would have occupied the
tract during its association with the Chapmans. The property was conveyed to C.M. Chapman by
Belle Chapman as executor of her husband’s estate in 1945 (Runnels County Deed Records
208:359) and remained in the Chapman family through 2002 (Runnels County Deed Records
204:404).

In summary, the parcel containing site 41RN247 was associated with various owners during the
twentieth century, most of whom did not occupy the property. After 1900, the tract could have been
occupied by Pauline Oliver (1903–before 1920) and/or associated tenants (1903–1924), tenants in
the employ of E.R. Middleton from 1924 through 1933, and/or tenants of the H.L. Chapman family
from 1933 through the remainder of the twentieth century. The property was likely used for
agriculture throughout the period.

The well at site 41RN247 appears to have been built in the early twentieth century and is of
construction typical of the era. It was likely associated with a residential structure depicted on
maps from both 1940 and 1961 (TSHD 1940, 1961), as well as on the 1967 USGS 7.5-minute
Bradshaw quadrangle map; however, no such structure remains standing, and no structural
remains were observed in the field.

The current property owner, Malcolm Bredemeyer, indicated the dwelling depicted on historic
maps at the location of site 41RN247 was also associated with a barn and the well located at the
site. The well reportedly extends to a depth of roughly 9 m (30 ft) from the top of the casing and is
still used for irrigation. Mr. Bredemeyer stated that the house was wood frame, measured less than
1,000 ft2 in size, and was demolished in the late 1960s (Bredemeyer 2011). As the dwelling first
appears on historic maps in 1940, and the extant well does not appear to date from an earlier time
period, it is unlikely that the site was associated with any unknown nineteenth-century occupants.

Conclusion

Historians did not encounter evidence that any of individuals associated with site 41RN247 were
significant to local development, nor is there any evidence that the site was associated with
important events or historic trends. No standing structures. No archeological integrity. No historic
connections. The site is not considered to merit listing in the NRHP. No further fieldwork within the
ROW is recommended.

41RN248

Site 41RN248 consists of a wide scatter of historic domestic artifacts and the remains of a well
located along County Road 312 in northern Runnels County. The nearest surface water is a creek
over 300 m (1,000 ft) to the east, making this area an MPA. Soils within the level site area have been
100006286/110039

V. Results
mapped as Portales clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (USDA, SCS 1970). Prior terracing and frequent
plowing have significantly disturbed the site’s integrity (Figure 33). The field was not planted at the
time of the survey, providing a high degree of surface visibility.

Artifacts were observed on the surface in a density of about 1 per 10 m2 (108 ft2) and in 8 of 25
shovel tests excavated to test site depth. All subsurface artifacts were encountered within the plow
zone, between 20 and 30 cm (8 and 24 inches) between ground surface and sandy clay (Table 8).
The historic debris observed included roughly 20 pieces of colorless and solarized glass, 5
whiteware sherds, 2 fragments of brown-glazed crockery, and 5 pieces of rusted iron, of which only
one piece was identifiable as a length of chain, possibly from farm machinery. The well is located in
the northwestern corner of the site within a thick stand of tall grasses (Figure 34). It has been
backfilled and covered by cement and the limestone blocks of its collapsed superstructure. Based
on the extent of the surface scatter, the distribution of subsurface artifacts, and the boundaries of
the ROW, the site occupies an area roughly 340 m (1,115 ft) in length east-west and 60 m (197 ft)
north-south (due to later changes in the ROW alignment).

Historic Research

Site 41RN248 appears to represent the remnants of a late-nineteenth- or early-twentieth-century
domestic site. Historic map research indicates that a schoolhouse and a residential structure were
located in this vicinity in 1940 (TSHD 1940). Only the residential structure appears on the 1961
general highway map (TSHD 1961).

Site 41RN248 is located on a 2.82-acre parcel within the original Henry Chapman Survey (Abstract
76) in Runnels County, Texas. John Forbes patented the 780-acre Bexar 1st-class headright
containing site 41RN248 on July 18, 1855 (GLO Records, Runnells County Abstract 76). First class
headrights were issued to individuals who arrived in Texas before March 4, 1836. Typically, heads
of families received one league and one labor (4505.5), and single men received one-half league
(1476.1 acres) (GLO n.d.1). Given that this survey only includes 780 acres, it is likely that the
remainder of the headright was patented in another area.

Forbes was enumerated in the 1860 Nacogdoches County Census as a 63-year-old clerk living in
Nacogdoches with $20,000 in real estate. Forbes continued to reside in Nacogdoches until his death
in 1880 and did not ever occupy the subject tract (Nichols 2011). Historians did not find any
conveyance of the property from Forbes or any records pertaining to the property until 1996, when
affiants testified that the property had been owned by Jeffrey Wayne Hallford and his predecessors
for at least the past 25 years (Runnels County Deed Records 127:581–583). Hallford sold the
property to W.L. and Edna England, the current owners, in 1996 (Runnels County Deed Records
129371). Historians reviewed the indices to deed records housed at the Runnels County
Courthouse in Ballinger, Texas, from 1880 through 2011 and did not locate any other conveyances

for this property. No earlier records were available, and no Hallfords were enumerated in the
Runnels County Census Records from 1880 through 1930. This data suggests the Hallford family
did not occupy the subject property during that period.

Conclusion

No standing structures or architectural remnants were observed during the survey, and any
archeological integrity has been compromised by continued plowing and farming, While the
eligibility of site 41RN248 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that
lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41RN249

Site 41RN249 is a prehistoric site consisting of a scatter of lithic debitage and tools. The site is
located on the gentle eastern slope of a low ridge between incised drainages, roughly 100 m
(328 ft) and 300 m (1,000 ft) on either side. Both are intermittent feeders of Elm Creek, 1,000 m
(0.62 mile) to the southeast, and the location is consequently considered to be an HPA. Soils within
the site area are mapped as belonging to the Potter series, representing very shallow gravelly clay
loams over cemented caliche (USDA, SCS 1970). Limestone gravels and cobbles were ubiquitous on
100006286/110039

V. Results
the surface, and ground surface visibility was roughly 75 percent due to scattered mesquite and
juniper and sparse grass (Figure 35).

Figure 35. Overview of site 41RN249, facing east.
Seven shovel tests were attempted within the deflated soils, with all proving negative for cultural
resources. The east-west boundaries of the site were determined to be 90 m (295 ft) based on the
extent of surface materials. Its 50-m (160-ft) north-south extent was based solely on the ROW
boundaries, with material observed continuing outside of the project area in both directions (Figure
36).

The artifact assemblage was composed of 1-per-square-meter (11-ft2) surface scatter of chert flakes
(some apparently modified), a chopper, and one second- or third-stage biface. Additional fragments
of chert were visible as well, but the breakage patterns suggested fragmentation during possible
machine clearance.
The site, which may have been a campsite and/or lithic quarry, has been subjected to livestock
grazing, moderate erosion, possible clearance, and truncation by the construction of County Road
(CR) 172 just to the north of the site (see Figure 36). No diagnostic artifacts or evidence of features

100006286/110039

were observed, and the lack of soil deposition precludes stratigraphy. While the eligibility of site
41RN249 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the
current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41RN250

Site 41RN250 represents a light scatter of lithic debitage located on a low rise between drainages in
an area designated as an HPA. The nearest lies roughly 100 m (328 m) to the south and feeds into
Elm Creek, 700 m (2,300 ft)to the southeast. Area soils belong to the Potter series (USDA, SCS
1970), and limestone and chert cobbles were observed in moderate density across the deflated
surface. Scattered grasses, mesquite, and juniper afforded about 50 percent surface visibility at the
time of the survey (Figure 37).

Figure 37. Overview of site 41RN250, facing northeast.
Approximately 50 chert flakes, cores, and expediently flaked tools were spread across the landform,
although they were found in slightly higher density of roughly one per square meter (11 ft2) on the
site’s western margin. There were about 10 tested cobbles, though flakes of the secondary and
tertiary stages of manufacture predominated. Because of the paucity of soil, no shovel tests were
excavated. The site measures roughly 145 m (475 ft) east-west based on the extent of the surface
scatter and the edges of the landform, with its width of 50 m (160 ft) determined by the ROW
boundaries (Figure 38).

100006286/110039

61

V. Results
As evidenced by the presence of ready lithic material and its proximity to water, the site most likely
functioned as a possible open-air campsite. No cultural features or time-diagnostic artifacts were
observed to further refine the site type. The site may extend beyond the ROW limits to the north,
but disturbance from grazing, fences, and construction of CR 172, combined with significant
erosion, have heavily impacted the site’s integrity. While the eligibility of site 41RN251 as a whole
cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not
appear to merit additional investigation.

41RN251

Site 41RN251 is a prehistoric lithic scatter observed on the surface. The site is situated on a narrow
ridgetop above an east-west feeder of Elm Creek (Figure 39). This, along with a second east-west
drainage, forms the margins of the landform. The area is consequently mapped as an HPA. Potter
soils have been mapped as the predominant soil series (USDA, SCS 1970), but erosion by wind and
water have resulted in a paucity of soil deposition. Low grasses, mesquite, and young juniper
composed the vegetation at the time of the survey. Ground surface visibility was up to 90 percent.

Figure 39. Overview of site 41RN251, facing northeast.
The lack of soils precluded shovel testing, so the boundaries of the site were determined by surface
observation. Less than 50 chert flakes and cores were dispersed relatively evenly over an extent
roughly 150 m (492 ft) north-south (Figure 40). The site's width was determined by the ROW
boundaries, as additional cultural materials were seen to extend beyond those to the east and west.
Artifacts found included unifaces, bifaces, and expedient tools such as modified flakes (Figure 41).

Figure 41. Representative artifacts from site 41RN251.
Based on the combination of both naturally occurring raw materials and proximity to water
sources, it is likely that site 41RN251 functioned as both a lithic quarry and an encampment.
However, no diagnostic materials or burned rocks were present; also, possible clearing, erosion,
and the construction of a stock tank to the south have significantly reduced the site's integrity and
limited its research potential. While the eligibility of site 41RN251 as a whole cannot be determined
at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit
additional investigation.

41RN252

Site 41RN252 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on a narrow ridgetop between two ephemeral
drainages in an area mapped as an HPA. Both drainages, one of which has been dammed for a stock
tank, feed Elm Creek, which lies approximately 300 m (1,000 ft) to the east. The area is mapped as
Portales clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (USDA, SCS 1970); however, the soils on the ridgetop are
mostly deflated, with limestone gravels in a high degree across the surface. At the time of the
survey, surface visibility ranged between 50 and 75 percent, varying with the density of low grasses
(Figure 42).

Eight shovel tests were attempted across the extent of the site (Figure 43), but all were shallow and
proved negative for cultural materials. Based on the north-south extent of surface materials, which
were found in a rough density of one per square meter (11 ft2), the site measures roughly 100 m
(328 ft). It extends across and beyond the current 50-m (160-ft) ROW to both east and west. Chert
artifacts observed included a biface (Figure 44), a scraper, and up to 20 pieces of lithic debitage.

Because few raw lithic materials were observed across the site it is likely that site 41RN252
represents an open-air campsite, which would have benefited from the proximity to water
resources. However, the shallow nature of the soils, the lack of diagnostic artifacts or features, and
the disturbance from damming of the drainage and possible clearance combine to suggest that the
research potential for the site is low. While the eligibility of site 41RN252 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

41RN253
Site 41RN253 consists of a light scatter of lithic materials located along a gentle, southwest-facing
slope. Elm Creek flows approximately 300 m (1,000 ft) to the east, and ephemeral drainages dissect
the landform on either side. The area is thus designated as an HPA. Soils in the area of the site are
representative of the Potter series clay loam (USDA, SCS 1970). Low grasses and scrub brush form
the predominant vegetation (Figure 45), resulting in 30 percent surface visibility.

Eight shovel tests, all shallow and negative, were placed across the landform to define the site area
(Figure 46). Based on the extent of observed surface materials, the site measures roughly 25 m
(82 ft) north-south and 30 m east-west (98 ft), continuing past the eastern ROW boundary.
Observed artifacts included 13 chert flakes, 9 tested cobbles, 1 utilized flake, and part of a preform
or dart point; the last was too fragmentary to provide type classification (Figure 47).

Due to the availability of lithic resources and the proximity to Elm Creek, it is likely that the site
functioned as a lithic procurement site and possibly as a campsite as well. Site integrity has been
compromised by sheet erosion, possible clearing, livestock grazing, and the damming of the
intermittent drainages on either side. While the eligibility of site 41RN253 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

41RN254
Comprising both prehistoric and possibly historic components, site 41RN254 is situated on a low
terrace above the northern edge of the Elm Creek floodplain in an area categorized as an HPA. At
the time of the survey, surface visibility was approximately 50 percent due to the site’s location in a
fallow agricultural field, which is now vegetated by low grasses and mesquite (Figure 48). The
Potter series of soils is mapped in this area and consist of shallow gravelly clay loams over
limestone (USDA, SCS 1970).

The site measures 50 m (160 ft) east-west, due to ROW restrictions, and 70 m (230 ft) north-south,
as defined by surface observation and shovel testing (Figure 49); it appears to extend outside of the
ROW to the west. Eleven shovel tests were excavated; two of these were positive, with artifacts
found to a depth of 20 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) (8 inches) (Table 9). Approximately 20
chert flakes—half secondary and half tertiary—were found, along with a single chert core. Modern
trash was also present (e.g., an enameled washbasin, unidentified iron, and 3 rusted metal barrels
of unknown function, roughly 1 m [3.2 ft] in height); however, these likely washed in from
somewhere upstream during a flooding episode of Elm Creek, as no structures are depicted in the
vicinity on any of the available historic maps consulted.

It is probable that the site functioned as an open-air campsite due to its proximity to Elm Creek, one
of the more reliable water sources in the area. However, no evidence of features was observed, and
no diagnostics were found, which could have identified a period of occupation. While the eligibility
of site 41RN254 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within
the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41RN255

A light scatter of prehistoric lithic material, site 41RN255 is situated on a level upland plain that
shows evidence of having been terraced, plowed, and planted in the past (Figure 50). The natural
drainages on this property have been rechanneled by the landowner, so the original distance from
the site to a natural water source is unknown; despite the modern disturbance, the proximity of the
drainages designates this area as an HPA. Olton clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, forms the
predominant soil type (USDA, SCS 1970). Vegetation at the time of the survey consisted of high
grasses and a row of mesquite, which most likely reflects a fence line that is no longer extant.
Despite the vegetation, the ground surface visibility in the site area was approximately 70 percent.
The site measures 55 m (180 ft) northwest-southeast by 40 m (131 ft) southwest-southeast, based
on the extent of its surface manifestation and shovel testing (Figure 51). Six shovel tests were
excavated, with none producing cultural materials. The surface artifact assemblage consisted of
approximately 20 pieces of chert debitage, all of either secondary or tertiary stage of manufacture.
A single biface was also present, but no diagnostic pieces or associated features were observed.

Site 41RN255 may represent an open-air campsite and possible lithic quarry, making use of both
proximity to water and shallow sources of lithic raw materials. However, agricultural activities and
probable rechannelization of the original water source have heavily impacted the site. While the
eligibility of site 41RN255 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that
lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41RN256
Site 41RN256, a surface scatter of lithic debitage, is located on a gently sloping upland plain within
a previously plowed field south of Ranch Road (RR) 1770. The area has been heavily impacted by
the excavation of an artificial drainage channel to the north, but may still be considered an HPA. The
original drainage may have been situated along the southern margin of the site, but no traces
remain. Soils within the area have been mapped as Rowena and Tobosa soils (USDA, SCS 1970). The
field is currently overgrown with high grasses and occasional sunflowers (Figure 52), which
allowed approximately 60 percent surface visibility at the time of the survey. Mature mesquite
trees line a north-south fence at the site’s eastern edge.

Figure 52. Overview of site 41RN256, facing north.
The site has a diameter of roughly 20 m (66 ft), as determined by surface observation, shovel
testing, and existing disturbances (Figure 53). Due to the degree of disturbance within the area,
only four shovel tests were dug, none of which produced cultural materials. The assemblage of
surface artifacts comprised approximately 15 pieces of debitage, of which the majority were of
secondary stage of manufacture and the rest of tertiary stage. No diagnostic materials or features
were observed.

Site 41RN256 has been substantially disturbed, precluding the survival of intact archeological
deposits. Consequently, the portion of the site surveyed does not appear to be NRHP eligible,
although the eligibility of the site as a whole cannot be determined at this time. However, this site
lies within a segment of ROW that has been made obsolete by later reroutes and will not be affected
by the current project.

41RN257
Site 41RN257 consists of the remains of a structure, most likely representing the Harmony Chapel,
a church represented on local maps. The site is located on relatively level uplands within a clearing
immediately west of northwest-southeast-trending CR 175. The lack of a nearby water source
designates this area as an MPA. The Mereta series is mapped as the predominant soil within the
area and consists of shallow clay loam over caliche (USDA, SCS 1970). Low grasses and mesquite
have grown up within and around the church’s foundation, limiting surface visibility to
approximately 20 percent.
All that survives of the structure itself are a concrete foundation and several piles of wooden
boards, the latter presumably the remains of its superstructure (figures 54 and 55). The concrete
foundation is not solid in area, but rather consists of a rectangular outer perimeter divided into four
smaller interior rectangles by three concrete lines spanning the middle (Figure 56). On the site’s
southern side, a flat concrete slab and step form an entryway. Three spigots are present around the
foundation, and a gas meter was observed outside to the north.

The artifact assemblage at the site included broken window glass in large amounts and
approximately 10 pieces of mirror glass and milk glass. These were found scattered across the
surface in general nearer the concrete foundation, but in no specific concentrations. Six shovel tests
placed around the foundations encountered only shallow soils and produced no additional artifacts.
Based on a partially enclosing fenceline, the extent of surface scatter, and the current project limits,
the portion of the site within the ROW measures 90 m (295 ft) north-south by 50 m (160 ft) eastwest (Figure 57).

Historic Research for Sites 41RN257 and 41RN258

Sites 41RN257 and 41RN258 are both located on a 146.2-acre tract within the original Thomas R.
Webb Survey (Abstract 503) in Runnels County, Texas. Map evidence and information provided by
local informants suggest that site 41RN257 represents the remnants of a school/church complex
dating to the early twentieth century. This evidence is supported by associated deed research. In
contrast, an oral informant suggests that no one ever lived at the site of 41RN258; however, census
and map evidence indicate it was likely the home of the W.F. Meadows family during the late
nineteenth century and early twentieth century.

Thomas R. Webb patented the Bexar 1st-class headright containing sites 41RN257 and 41RN258
(2,275.94 acres) on March 6, 1874 (GLO Records, Runnels County Abstract 503). First class
headrights were issued to individuals who arrived in Texas before March 2, 1836. Typically, heads
of families received one league (4,428 acres) and one labor (177.1 acres), and single men received
1/3rd league (1,476.1 acres) (GLO n.d.1). It is unclear why Webb only received 2,275.94 acres,
though he did own another 1st-class headright in the county including 1,223.36 acres (GLO
Records, Runnels County Abstract 504), for a total of 3,499.3 acres.
A Thomas R. Webb (49) appears in the 1860 Robertson County census records. The farmer lived
with his family in the Owensville Post Office Precinct and owned $3,750 in real estate and $8,540
worth of personal property. The same individual does not appear in the 1870 or 1880 Texas census
records, and no individuals named Webb appear in the 1870 or 1880 Runnels County census
records. As a result, it is unlikely that Webb ever occupied his headright.

It is unclear when Webb or his heirs began to partition his holdings; however, John C. Roberts, a
resident of Robertson County, conveyed 400 acres of the survey to W.F. Meadows of Coleman
County for $1,800 in September of 1890 (Runnels County Deed Records 13:338). The property’s
continued association with owners from Robertson County during the nineteenth century suggests
either that it remained undeveloped or that it was leased out to tenants or for cattle grazing during
the period. W.F. Meadows acquired interest in an adjacent 131-acre parcel in the Webb Survey for
$1,232.50 from Isham A. Meadows, a resident of Taylor County, in 1906 (Runnels County Deed
Records 46:163). Together these parcels likely constituted his home and farmstead.

V. Results
Contemporary census records suggest that the Meadows family may have relocated to the parcel
containing the subject property sometime after their acquisition of it in 1890. No census records
are available for that year, but by 1900, Will F. Meadows, a 42-year-old farmer, lived in Precinct 5 of
Runnels County. Mr. Meadows owned his property and was surrounded by households of renters,
suggesting he may have had tenants working on his farm. His household included his wife Elizabeth
(32), children Elizabeth C. (13), Carry A. (7), Dori S. (5), Nellie A. (3), and Willie M. (1), his brother
Isham (56), and his mother- and father-in-law Elizabeth Houston (indecipherable) and Martin J.
Houston (67).

The family lived in the same area in 1910. William F. Meadows (52) lived with his wife Addie (42).
Later records suggest that William’s wife’s middle name was Addie and that this entry represents
the same individual enumerated as Elizabeth in 1900. Their household also included their five
daughters, Carrie (17), Dovie (15), Addie (13), Willie May (11), and Mattie (8), and Meadows still
owned his farm. Isham Meadows is not enumerated in the 1910 Runnels County or Texas census
records.

By 1920, census records describe the Meadows family as living in the “district northeast of Winters
town,” which correlates to the general location of the subject parcel. The household included
William F. (61), Elizabeth A. (52), Carrie (29), Addie (23), and Mattie (19). Meadows was still
indexed as a farmer and owned his own property. The family lived one household from the William
D. Meadows family. William D. Meadows (49) lived with his wife Lillie S. (48) and children William
C. (29), Thomas A. (27), and Thelma (22) on property he owned. His occupation is indecipherable in
the record, as are most of his family’s, but at least one of his daughters (Thelma) worked as a
teacher at a local school, possibly the school historically located near site 41RN257. His relation to
W.F. Meadows is unclear; however, his age suggests they may have been siblings or cousins.

W.F. Meadows died sometime prior to 1927 when his widow Addie began to convey property from
their estate as executor of his will. In that year, she conveyed 2 acres out of the 400-acre tract
Meadows purchased in 1890 to Roy L. Pumphrey, Truitt Billups, J.H. Hobbs, and Will Worthington,
deacons of the Harmony Baptist Church (Runnels County Deed Records 135:71). This tract contains
site 41RN257. The deed references that the parcel was adjacent to a 4-acre tract containing the
Harmony School, though historians were unable to find a conveyance from Meadows regarding the
school tract. Ten year later in November of 1937, Addie Meadows conveyed 146.2 acres
surrounding the school and church tracts to her daughter Carrie Powers. This tract contains site
41RN258. Powers lived in Taylor County at the time of the conveyance, which specifically excluded
the 2-acre church tract and 4-acre school tract from the transfer (Runnels County Deed Records
171:131).
Though it is possible that Addie Meadows continued to live on the subject property adjacent to the
church and school after her husband’s death, historians were unable to find an entry for her in the
1930 Runnels County census records. Carrie Powers appears in the 1930 Taylor County census
100006286/110039

V. Results
living on 11th Street in Abilene with her husband Zene and children Steve and Joan. Subsequent
deed records indicate she continued to reside in Taylor County throughout her association with the
property suggesting that any occupants of the tract during that period would have been tenants.
The Powers family retained the 146.2 acres until 1968 when Carrie A. and Zene Powers, Steve and
Sue Powers, and Billie L. and Joann Duncan, all of Taylor County, conveyed the property, along with
several other tracts, to Irene C. Williams for $8,000 (Runnels County Deed Records 401:267).

Historians were unable to find a conveyance for the 2-acre church tract or the 4-acre school tract
back to the Meadows/Powers family; however, it appears that they were included in the
146.2 acres conveyed by Carrie Powers et al. to Irene Williams as they are not specifically excluded
in the metes-and-bounds description of the property. This evidence suggests that both facilities
were no longer in operation by 1968. Williams owned the property until 1981 when she conveyed
the parcel to Billy H. and Ruby M. Brewer for $49,445 with a vendor’s lien (Runnels County Deed
Records 513:155). The property remains in the Brewer family at present. Billy and Ruby Brewer
conveyed the property to their son Stephen Brewer in 1999 (Runnels County Official Public
Records 174:564).
Communication with the current property owner Stephen Brewer indicates that the church was
still standing but no longer in use when his parents acquired the property, though he recalled they
purchased it in the early 1970s, which conflicts with the deed evidence. Mr. Brewer indicated that
the school was located about 91 m (300 ft) to the southwest of the church, outside of the ROW; it
was no longer extant at the time of purchase (Brewer 2011). Additional oral informants, Mr. and
Mrs. Troy McKnight, recalled attending socials at the church from circa 1945 through 1947
indicating that it still served parishioners during the mid-twentieth century. The McKnights recall
that the nearby school building was still standing during the period, though it did not appear to
have been used for some time. The McKnights were not members of the church, which likely served
a rural population surrounding the nearby communities of Crews and Winters (McKnight and
McKnight 2011).

Conclusion

Historic map research shows the schoolhouse depicted on the 1936 Runnels County General
Highway map (TSHD 1940a), but not on later maps. The church, labeled as “Harmony,” appears on
the 1958 Runnels County General Highway map (TSHD 1961a) and as “Harmony Ch” on the USGS
1962 Crews 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map. The structure has obviously been
demolished, and the site area subjected to clearing, as evidenced by push piles. The mesquite
growing through the foundations indicates that clearing was not recent (see Figure 57). The lack of
archeological and structural integrity preclude the ability of additional fieldwork to provide further
significant information about the site. While the eligibility of site 41RN257 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

41RN258
Site 41RN258 represents a probable historic homestead located immediately west of CR 175. It is
situated on the southwest slope of a low terrace overlooking the narrow alluvial plain of Long
Branch Creek approximately 150 m (500 ft) to south; the area is consequently mapped as an HPA.
Soils within the site area are mapped as the Pleistocene-aged Olton clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes
(USDA, SCS 1970). Surface visibility was limited to roughly 5 percent due to the presence of high
grasses at the time of the survey (Figure 58).

Figure 58. Overview of site 41RN258, facing south.
The site consists of a dense scatter of historic domestic refuse and farm implements clustered
around several features (Figure 59). These include a narrow path of tabular limestone blocks
(Figure 60), a downed windmill, shallow indentations within the ground surface, a concrete trough,
and a small concrete foundation. A small shed sheathed in corrugated metal is located outside of the
ROW to the west, and a wide stock tank lies at the site’s southwestern edge. Six out of 13 shovel
tests proved positive for historic materials, to a maximum depth of 30 cm below surface (Table 10).
Based on fencelines, shovel tests, the extent of surface materials, and ROW boundaries, the site
measures roughly 50 m (160 ft) east-west by 65 (213 ft) m north-south.

The artifact assemblage included glass vessels, a scatter of rusted metal, and several brick
fragments. The glass bottles, less than 5 in number, included clear glass condiment containers and
brown glass medicine bottles for livestock. For the most part, the original function of the metal was
unidentifiable, though corrugated tin sheets and a single metal barrel were present. The majority of
the bricks were of two types representing the Abilene Brick Co., of Taylor County, which began
operation in the 1930s, and is still active (Steinbomer 1982, types 46 and 47). More chronologically
definitive are bricks from the Palmer Pressed Brick Company of Ellis County, which operated
between 1902 and 1929 (Steinbomer 1982, type 195). Also present were examples from the Ferris
Brick Company, also of Ellis County, dating to the late 1920s (Steinbomer 1982, type 120). A 1945
penny, the windmill, and other debris indicate continued usage of the site into the mid-twentieth
century.

Historic Research

Site 41RN258 is located on the same property as site 41RN257, and thus the majority of the
archival evidence has already been presented in the description for site 41RN258. A residence
roughly in this location occurs on the 1936 Runnels County General Highway Map (TSHD 1940a),
and again appears on the 1958 Runnels County General Highway Map (TSHD 1961a); however, no
structure is depicted on the 1962 Crews 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map, suggesting that
the site structures may have been demolished within that period. The landowner, Mr. Brewer
indicated that he was not aware of any occupation on this portion of the property, confirming that
the former dwelling at that location was gone by the time his family purchased the land. This
correlates with the deed and census evidence that suggests the Meadows family’s occupation
extended through the mid-1920s. The property may have been leased to tenants during its
associated with Carrie Powers and/or reverted to agricultural use during the period.

Conclusion

Because of the site’s condition and lack of stratigraphic integrity, its research potential is limited.
While the eligibility of site 41RN258 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of
the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41RN259

Site 41RN259 consists of a cluster of historic structures, both standing and collapsed, with a minor
prehistoric component. It is located on a gentle slope, along which flows a northeast-southwest
feeder of Long Branch Creek, thus placing the site within an HPA. Shallow Potter soils are mapped
as the predominant soil type (USDA, SCS 1970), and scattered short grasses and mesquite trees
provided variable surface visibility, ranging from 30 to 90 percent.

One wooden barn (Figure 61) and two smaller wooden sheds (Figure 62), each with corrugated tin
roofing, remain standing. The remnants of another structure are located at the site’s northwestern
margin, and consist of a collapsed wooden frame (Figure 63), scattered limestone pier stones, and
fragmentary red bricks. The last are products of the Ferris Brick Company, which began production
in 1901 (Steinbomer 1982, type 119). None of the 11 shovel tests placed across the site produced
cultural materials.

All artifacts were found on the surface. The historic artifact assemblage consisted of a less than 20
scattered fragments of clear, blue, and brown glass, including one complete brown bottle for
livestock medicine. Pieces of rusted scrap metal were also present, with only two being identifiable
as unlabeled cans. Only two chert flakes represent the prehistoric component. Based on the
structures, shovel tests, and surface scatter, the site measures roughly 80 m (262 ft) northwestsoutheast; its 50-m (160-ft) northeast-southwest is established by the ROW boundaries, beyond
which the site extends (Figure 64).

Historic Research

Site 41RN259 is located within a 684.2-acre tract within the original Juan Jose Ximines Survey
(Abstract 569) in Runnels County, Texas. Archival evidence indicates it was associated with a series
of absentee owners throughout its history, and any occupants during the historic period would
likely have been unidentified tenants. John H. Herndon patented the 4,428-acre Bexar 1st-class
headright on December 2, 1854 (GLO, Runnels County Abstract 569). John Hunter Herndon, an
early Texas settler and plantation owner, reportedly owned over a million acres of land in Texas
during the antebellum period. His obvious interest in land speculation and residency outside of
Runnels County until his death (Muir 2011) indicates he acquired the survey as an investment and
never lived there.
Though the nineteenth century history of the parcel is unclear, the Ximines Survey had not been
partitioned by 1921 when Mrs. Cora L. Davenport of Bexar County conveyed the entire land grant to
her son Harris Davenport, a resident of Harris County. The deed indicates that Cora Davenport
acquired the property via a lawsuit in 1917 (Runnels County Deed Records 115:454). Harris
Davenport retained the property until his death in 1966. His probate document indicates he lived
on a farm in Bexar County and not on the subject survey (Runnels County Deed Records 490:20).
Upon his death, the property appears to have passed to his wife Martha Louise Davenport, who died
in 1978 (Runnels County Deed Records 490:51).

the survey containing site 41RN259 was awarded to John Harris Davenport, whom earlier records
indicate was a resident of Bexar County (Runnels County Deed Records 512:375). Davenport
retained the property through 2006 when he sold 694.2 acres containing site 41RN259 to Stephen
and Elizabeth Secrest of Visalia, California (Runnels County Official Public Records 269:45). The
property’s continued association with absentee owners and the fact that it was not partitioned until
1981 suggests that the structural remains at site 41RN259 were likely associated with occupation
of the tract by unidentified tenants during the early twentieth century.
Site 41RN259 is present on the 1936 Runnels County General Highway Map (TSHD 1940a) as well
as the 1958 General Highway Map (TSHD 1961a), and appears as a residence and an outbuilding on
the 1962 Crews 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map.

Conclusion

Due to the dilapidated nature of the structures and the lack of archeological integrity, it is doubtful
that further work would produce significant information. Additionally, archival research has
produced no evidence that the site was associated with significant individuals, events, or historic
trends While the eligibility of site 41RN259 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the
portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional
investigation.

41RN260
Site 41RN260 is a prehistoric lithic scatter perched on a low terrace above what appears to be a
relic channel of Long Branch Creek, which runs north-south approximately 100 m (328 ft) to the
west; the area is therefore designated as an HPA. Soils within the area have been mapped as
Portales clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (USDA, SCS 1970). Sparse grasses and scattered mesquite
made up the predominant vegetation at the time of the survey.
Less than 30 pieces of chert debitage were observed, with no obvious distinctions of density. Eight
shovel tests were placed to determine the site’s vertical and horizontal extent, none of which
yielded cultural material. Soils within these proved to be compact shallow loams above limestone,
with only one test continuing past 5 cmbs (2 inches) to 25 cmbs (10 inches). Based on surface
observation, shovel testing, and ROW boundaries, the site measures approximately 50 m (160 ft)
north-south and 50 m (160 ft) east-west (Figure 65).

Due to its proximity to a relatively major drainage, site 41RN260 was most likely an open-air
campsite, though no features remain to confirm this. Neither were any diagnostic artifacts found,
precluding the ability to secure the site chronologically. While the eligibility of site 41RN260 as a
whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW
does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41RN261

Site 41RN261 represents a prehistoric open-air campsite and a probable historic trash dump. The
site occupies a thin ridge between Mud Creek to the south and an intermittent feeder to the north
and west, in an area categorized as an HPA. The site is located primarily on the ridge, though the
historic scatter extends south onto the gently sloping plain above Mud Creek., likely redeposited by
sheetwash. Soils on the heavily deflated ridgetop have been mapped as Potter soils, while those on
the gentle slope to the south belong to the Rowena and Tobosa series, 1 to 3 percent slopes (USDA,
SCS 1970); neither of those two groupings are noted for soil depth.

The site area is currently used for grazing, with cattle feeders and a related two-track road at the
base of the ridge, which meanders along the site’s southwestern margin. Vegetation at the time of
the survey consisted of low grasses, prickly pear, and mesquite on the heavily soil-poor ridge slope,
with surface visibility averaging 90 percent (Figure 66). In contrast, the plain above the creek was
more densely wooded with juniper and mesquite, and surface visibility was consequently much
lower, except in areas where two-track roads and other disturbance occurred. Sixteen shovel tests
or probes were placed across the ridge and corresponding plain; all proved negative for cultural
materials (Figure 67). These, combined with surface observation and the ROW boundaries, present
a site area of roughly 150 m (492 ft) northwest-southeast by 50 m (160 ft) southwest-northeast.
Surface observation proves that the site extends beyond its 50-m (160-ft) width in both directions.

The prehistoric lithic scatter lies primarily along the southern slope of the ridge. It is of very low
density, consisting only of five pieces of debitage of tertiary stage of manufacture, one chert arrow
point, a dart point, and one fragmentary biface, which may represent the distal end of a dart point
(Figure 68). The dart point is a proximal fragment 2.1 cm in length, 2.8 cm in width, and 5.9 cm
thick. Its widely expanding stem and strong shoulders are characteristics common to the Edgewood
type (Turner and Hester 1999:111), but such a categorization cannot be confirmed due to its
present condition. The arrow point is a medial fragment, 2.2 cm in length and worked on both its
dorsal and ventral sides. The truncated stem could have been either straight or contracting, and the
shoulders may once have been barbed, suggesting either the common Perdiz type or the highly
localized Moran type (Turner and Hester 1999); due to its fragmentary nature, however, an exact
typing cannot be determined and thus, by default, it can only safely be dated to post-700 A.D.
(Turner and Hester 1999:57). The arrow point and possible dart point were collected but will be
returned to the private landowner.

Figure 68. Lithics from site 41RN261; clockwise from top left: possible dart point,
arrow point, distal end of thinned biface, biface thinning flake, tertiary flake.
The historic artifact assemblage included approximately 50 pieces of glass (aqua, solarized, milk),
10 pieces of undecorated ironstone, 2 sherds of glazed stoneware, and unidentifiable metal
fragments, most likely representing the rusted remains of iron cans. Two fragmentary red bricks
were found on the ridgetop, displaying three cylindrical holes on the widest sides but no identifying
stamps. No evidence was found of any historic structures beyond those. Due to the distribution of
the lighter fragments over the longest distance, it is likely that the historic component of site
100006286/110039

96

V. Results
41RN261 represents a trash dump that has since been redistributed by erosion, both eolian and
fluvial. Mrs. Salma Dietz, the landowner’s grandmother, said that the property had been in their
family since 1912. She mentioned a home that was in the vicinity prior to her husband’s birth in
1915, but historic map research suggests that the structure was never in the locale of site 41RN261.
Such a date would be consistent with the artifact assemblage, such as the solarized glass, the
production of which is typically dated between 1880 and 1918 (Stelle 2010).
Because of the moderate to high erosion on the landform and the resultant overprinting of
occupation periods, further work on the site’s prehistoric component is not likely to produce
significant information. The site’s historic component likely represents a refuse dump that has
partially been redeposited by wash. While the eligibility of site 41RN261 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

41RN262

Site 41RN262 consists of a wide surface scatter of historic domestic refuse concentrated around
two wooden structures and a fenced corral. The site is located at the base of a gentle slope above an
intermittent drainage roughly 100 m (328 ft) to the south; this area is considered to be an HPA.
Soils in the vicinity are mapped as belonging to the Potter series (USDA, SCS 1970). At the time of
the survey, low grasses were predominant within the cleared area occupied by the structures
(Figure 69). Vegetation within the southern portion of the site consisted of some low grasses, dense
patches of cacti, and scattered mesquite trees. In general, these vegetation conditions yielded
surface visibility averaging 60 percent.

The site measures roughly 200 m (656 ft) north-south, based on the extent of surface scatter and
shovel testing of the shallow soil; however, the structures and highest artifact density occur at its
northern margin (see Figure 69). It crosses the 50-m (160-ft) east-west ROW and obviously extends
beyond those limits. Both buildings are of wood construction sheathed in corrugated sheet metal
(Figure 70). A corral of wood and wire is attached to the backside of the structures to the north.
Both may once have been outbuildings but have since been heavily modified. Old power lines were
also present. The site area is covered by both modern trash (e.g., recent beer cans) and a wide
historic scatter consisting of solarized, clear, and green glass shards and sherds of ironstone and
stoneware (Figure 71). Artifact density exceeded three pieces per square meter (11 square ft)
within 50 m (164 ft) of the structures, and dropped significantly with distance, likely reflecting
secondary deposition by sheet wash. A well of limestone blocks lies just southwest of the ROW on
the terrace above the drainage.

Historic Research
Archival evidence indicates that site 41RN262 was likely associated with occupation of the
associated parcel by a series of tenants beginning in the late nineteenth century and extending into
the early twentieth century. Site 41RN262 is located on a 370.4-acre tract (known as Blocks 11 and
12) in the Juliana Vaske Cabrera Survey in Runnels County, Texas. Cabrera’s heirs patented the
Travis 1st-class headright for one league and one labor (4,605.50 acres) in August of 1861. First
class headrights were issued to individuals who arrived in Texas before March 2, 1836, and
Cabrera’s allocation of the full league and labor indicates she was head of a family (GLO n.d.1).

The league-and-labor survey remained intact through 1881 when Samuel Maverick conveyed the
entire survey to James Shaw and John W. Harris for $150 (Runnels County Deed Records 1:31).
Maverick, likely Samuel Maverick, Jr., was the son of land baron and early Texas settler Samuel
Maverick. The family were early Anglo settlers in San Antonio, and Maverick Jr. died in Austin in
1936 (Fenstermaker 2011). His family’s known occupation outside of Runnels County and
association with early land speculation efforts throughout the state suggests Maverick purchased
the parcel as an investment and later conveyed it as part of a land deal.

Census and subsequent deed evidence confirms that Shaw and Harris were land speculators as well.
J.W. Harris appears in the 1880 Galveston County census living in the city of Galveston. He worked
as an attorney. James Shaw also appears in the 1880 Galveston County census. He was enumerated
as a planter living on Bolivar Point. Shaw conveyed all of his interest in the Cabrera Survey to the
Harris family in 1888 (Runnels County Deed Records 10:157). Subsequent conveyances suggest the
survey remained in the Harris family and was partitioned and leased to tenants throughout the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
J.W. Harris died sometime between 1881 and 1885. In that year, his heirs, including Annie B. Harris,
Rebecca P. Harris, and John W. Harris of Galveston County and Lillie Harris Fisher of Travis County,
leased 184 acres of the subject tract (Block 12) to an individual named F.E. Henderson. The 3-year
lease required Henderson to live on the property and to keep 75 acres in cultivation for the cost of
$18.40 per year. After the lease was up, Henderson was to be given the first option to purchase the
property (Runnels County Deed Records 17:375). Similarly, in 1895, the Harris heirs leased Block
11, which also included 184 acres, to A.D. Talley. The lease was similar to that issued to F.E.
Henderson and stipulated that Talley could not sublease the property during the period (Runnels
County Deed Records 17:250).

Though historians were unable to find an entry for F.E. Henderson in either the 1880 or 1900
Runnels County census records, A.D. Tally [sic] (53) was still farming rented property in Runnels
County in 1900. His household included his wife Jane H. (72), and it is possible the couple lived on
the property they leased from the Harris family in 1895. In 1910, Armeaneus D. Tally (63) was still
renting property in the same precinct. His occupation is listed as tanner on a stock farm, and his
100006286/110039

100

V. Results
household included his wife Jane H. (82). He lived alone by 1920 when he was indexed as Americus
D. The 73-year-old had no occupation, and though it is unclear from the record what his tenant
status was, he was not identified as a property owner. It is possible that Talley continued to occupy
the parcel containing site 41RN262 during this period.
The blocks containing site 41RN262 were still associated with the Harris family in 1969. In that
year, John W. Harris of Galveston County and Florence Meyers, a widow of Bexar County, conveyed
Blocks 11 and 12, now recorded as 370.4 acres, to Marcus J. and Glenda S. Bryan (Runnels County
Deed Records 409:166). It is unclear from the records which block contained the subject site.
Though no other leases for the blocks associated with the subject tract were identified in the deed
record, project historians encountered numerous similar leases for various portions of the Cabrera
Survey throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This pattern suggests that the
Harris family operated a tenant plantation on the Cabrera Survey and that site 41RN262 could have
been associated with any number of unidentified tenants during the late nineteenth and/or early
twentieth century.

Conclusion

Historic map research indicates that the site is depicted only on the 1962 Crews 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle map as a single outbuilding. Both structures now extant at the site have
suffered from dilapidation and appear to have been subjected to subsequent modification. The
structures were most likely intended for use with livestock, as evidenced by the corral; however, it
appears that both are now in use as part of a hunting lease. The site locale has been impacted by
grazing, construction of fences, and heavy use as a trash dump. Despite its potential association
with tenancy in Runnels County, there is no evidence that the site was specifically associated with
significant individuals, trends, or events. While the eligibility of site 41RN262 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

41RN263

Site 41RN263 consists solely of a historic well. Located within 20 m (67 ft) of CR 152, the site is
situated on a gentle slope immediately above an unnamed intermittent tributary of Mud Creek,
consequently an HPA. Mereta clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is mapped as the predominant soil
type, representing shallow clay loams over caliche on stream terraces (USDA, SCS 1970). Overall
vegetation consists of low grasses and prickly pears, with thick grasses predominating within the
creek bed, providing ground surface visibility of less than 10 percent at the time of survey.
No artifacts were found on the surface, and all six shovel tests proved negative for cultural
materials. For this reason, the site’s defined borders are limited to the well itself (Figure 72). The
feature is constructed of cut limestone and sealed with cement on the exterior surface. It measures

100006286/110039

101

V. Results
roughly 90 cm (35.4 inches) in height and 120 cm (47.2 inches) in diameter (Figure 73). Depth to
water was found to be approximately 4.5 m (15 ft) below the structure’s rim, though a bottom
depth could not be determined. Grooves cut into the well top indicate the positioning of a now nonexistent wooden superstructure for bucket support. An inscription in the cement on the well’s
outside face reads: “L P, 3/29.”

Figure 73. Well at site 41RN263.
Site 41RN263 represents a well dating to 1929, which is not depicted on any of the available
historic maps, nor are any associated structures. Because the property is heading towards
condemnation, a landowner interview was not possible at the time of this report. Because the site is
an isolated feature with no intact archeological deposits and little research potential, it does not
appear to be eligible for listing in the NRHP. No additional work is considered necessary.

41RN264

Site 41RN264 is a light scatter of lithic artifacts found on the surface of a gentle upland slope in an
HPA. It is situated along the western edge of an ephemeral drainage feeding Middle Mustang Creek,
which lies approximately 400 m to the southwest. Scattered grasses, yucca, and mesquite occupy
the very shallow gravelly soils of the Talpa-Kavett complex (USDA, SCS 1970), yielding ground
surface visibility of roughly 80 percent (Figure 74).

100006286/110039

103

V. Results

Figure 74. Overview of site 41RN264, facing south.
Eleven shovel tests were placed across the landform to determine the site’s extent; all proved
negative for cultural materials within the deflated soils. The site measures roughly 85 m (279 ft)
east-west, based on the extent of surface materials, by 50 m (160 ft) north-south, as dictated by the
ROW boundaries (Figure 75). It likely extends to the north and south beyond the current ROW.

Roughly 15 pieces of lithic debitage were observed on the surface, more or less evenly split
between flakes of secondary and tertiary stage of manufacture, with most being between 2 and
5 cm in length. One crude biface fragment, a possible preform, was also present; however, there
were no diagnostic materials or cultural features to further clarify the nature of the site.

Erosion, cattle grazing, and possible mechanical clearing have heavily impacted the site. A fence to
the south and an existing transmission line to the north have also had negative effects on the site’s
integrity. Due to these limiting factors as well as the lack of observed time-diagnostic materials or
prehistoric features, further work is not likely to produce information that will contribute
significantly to the history of this region. While the eligibility of site 41RN264 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

41RN265
Site 41RN265 consists of a thin scatter of lithic debitage. It is located on a gentle upland slope
approximately 95 m (312 ft) northwest of Middle Mustang Creek; this area is mapped as an HPA.
The soils in the site vicinity are mapped as Kavett silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (USDA, SCS 1970),
and presented shallow deposition over indurated bedrock. Vegetation consisted of low grasses,
prickly pear cactus, and mesquite at the time of the survey, with surface visibility averaging
40 percent.

The site measures 60 m (197 ft) northwest-southeast by 25 m (82 ft) northeast-southwest based on
surface inspection and shovel tests, all 11 of which were culturally negative (Figure 76). The
entirety of the artifact assemblage was found on the surface, including approximately 15 chert
flakes, most of tertiary stage of manufacture and measuring less than 3 cm in length. Also present
were one larger primary flake and two secondary flakes. No time-diagnostic artifacts or evidence of
features were observed. Based on observation from the ROW, the site extends in both directions
beyond the project area.

Site 41RN265 was most likely an open-air campsite, which capitalized on its proximity to both
water and exposed lithic resources. The site has been subjected to impacts by grazing, probable
clearing (as evidenced by machine-spalled chert), erosion, and the construction of an existing
power line located 40 m to the northeast. While the eligibility of site 41RN265 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

41CN288

Site 41CN288 constitutes a sparse scatter of lithic debitage and burned rock. Grape Creek lies
almost 1,000 m (3,280 ft) to the west, but ephemeral drainages feeding the creek are in closer
proximity, though still far enough to designate this an MPA. A low ridge crossing the site is evidence
of previous contour terracing and agricultural use; however, the level plain has since been
overgrown with low grasses and mesquite and is now used for livestock grazing (Figure 77).
Ground visibility was limited to 10 percent at the time of the survey. The major soil type in this area
is Mereta clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (USDA, SCS 1974).
On the bases of surface observation and five negative shovel tests, the site measures roughly
100 m2 (1,076 ft2) in diameter (Figure 78). Artifacts at the site included only 2 chert flakes, 11
tested cobbles, and 4 burned rocks. No diagnostics or features were observed.

Figure 77. Overview of site 41CN288.
Site 41CN288 has been heavily disturbed by terracing and plowing. Its lack of features or diagnostic
materials, combined with the paucity of observed artifacts, suggest that the site lacks significant
research potential. While the eligibility of site 41CN288 as a whole cannot be determined at this
time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional
investigation.

41CN289

Site 41CN289 is a historic site located on a level upland plain at the base of a steep slope. Elm Creek
lies roughly 700 m to the northeast, so the area is designated as an MPA. The local soils have been
mapped as belonging to the relatively shallow Rowena series of clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes
(USDA, SCS 1974). At the time of the survey, vegetation consisted of thick grasses, prickly pears,
and a moderate density of mesquite, both new and old growth limiting ground surface visibility to
20 percent.

100006286/110039

The site includes a well (outside the ROW), a collapsed wooden structure, an animal pen, and
several concentrations of historic debris. Of 16 shovel tests placed to test site limits, 4 produced
cultural materials (Table 11), all clustered around the rough center of the site (Figure 79). Based on
the surface manifestation and shovel testing, the site extends approximately 120 m (394 ft) eastwest by 100 m (328 ft) north-south. The bulk of the site lies to the southwest of the current project
area, with the portion of the site within the ROW confined primarily to a thin surface scatter of
domestic refuse.

Artifacts included less than 20 pieces of fragmentary whiteware and ironstone, as well as
approximately 50 pieces of glass, mainly of the clear, solarized, milk, brown, and aquamarine
varieties. Two clear glass canning jars and the bowl of an iron spoon were also present. All
subsurface artifacts were shallow, with the exception of one possible chert flake, which was found
at a depth of 43 cm (17 inches) below surface. The well is of limestone-and-mortar concentration,
with the remains of a slight wooden superstructure (Figure 80). About 10 unstamped machinemade bricks, some collapsed wood, and sheets of corrugated tin attest to prior architecture. The
remains of what appear to be a refrigerator, stove, and shelving testify to the domestic nature of the
site.

Historic Research
The 136.2-acre and 133-acre tracts associated with site 41CN289 are located within the original
Josias B. Beall league-and-labor survey (4,605.50 acres) in Coleman County, Texas. Beall’s heirs
patented the Travis 1st-class headright in August of 1860. First class headrights were issued to
individuals who arrived in Texas before March 2, 1836, and Beall’s allocation of the full league and
labor indicates he was head of a family (GLO n.d.1). Though it is possible that Beall lived
somewhere on his headright prior to the patent date, his death before 1860 suggests he never
occupied the property. Additionally, no one with the last name Beall appears in the 1860 Coleman
County census records, suggesting the parcels may have been unimproved during the midnineteenth century.

Though historians did not find a conveyance for the subject property until 1905, when the
136.2-acre parcel was sold, deed evidence suggests both tracts were part of the Matthews Ranch
during the late nineteenth century and may have been used as pastureland through their
conveyance in the early twentieth century. J.M. Matthews began acquiring property in Coleman
County as early as 1881 when he purchased 600 acres in the Beall Survey (Coleman County Deed
Records G:87). The Matthews (or Mathews) family does not appear in the 1880 Coleman County
census records, and J.M. Matthews passed away prior to 1900 when his widow Amanda T. appears
100006286/110039

112

V. Results
as the head of household in the Coleman County census. The record lists her occupation as “stock
raising,” and the 53-year-old’s household included her four sons Frank S. (20), Claude (15), Martin
H. (14), and an 11-year-old with the middle initial “l” whose name is indecipherable.

It appears that Amanda Matthews inherited a substantial estate including land in various surveys
upon the death of her husband. A 1906 quitclaim deed—in which some of the heirs of J.M. Matthews
recognized her title to various lands as stipulated in Matthews’ will—references her ownership of
760.2 acres in the Beall Survey as well as various tracts in other adjacent Coleman County surveys
(Coleman County Deed Records 55:298). Amanda Matthews officially subdivided her property into
blocks in February of 1906. Though it had been conveyed previously, the 136.2-acre parcel is
referred to as Block 19 in the partition, and the adjacent 133-acre parcel is listed as Block 16
(Coleman County Deed Records 55:251). The subject parcels have separate histories during the
early twentieth century.

In 1905, Mrs. Amanda T. Mathews [sic], widow, F.F. Mathews, M. Tate Barnett, C.V. Mathews,
R. Barnett, and Marten [sic] Mathews, all of Coleman County, sold the 136.2-acre tract (Block 19) to
L.E. Conner, also of Coleman County. The record describes the parcel as being out of the
“Mrs. Amanda T. Mathews [sic] pasture or lands” (Coleman County Deed Records 55:635). This
evidence suggests the property remained undeveloped rangeland throughout its association with
the Matthews family.

Conner retained the tract until January of 1908 when he conveyed the property to Ben S. Long for
$5,448. The document describes both men as residents of Runnels County. Though Conner is
referred to as L.E. Cormen in the transaction, a reference to the original 1905 conveyance confirms
that the grantor is the same individual who purchased the property from the Matthews heirs in
1905 (Coleman County Deed Records 71:622). The property continued to change hands rapidly
over the next few years. In April of 1910, Ben Long conveyed the property to J.A. Long, a resident of
Runnels County, for $3,100 (Coleman County Deed Records 71:623). A few months later in
November of the same year, J.A. Long sold the property to G.W. White for $3,500 (Coleman County
Deed Records 73:84). White, also a resident of Runnels County, retained the property until 1916
when he and his wife Martha K. transferred the 136.2-acre tract to Alden Brookshier of Runnels
County. Brookshier paid $1,825 for the property and assumed the remaining vendor’s lien notes
owed by the Whites (Coleman County Deed Records 92:152).
Contemporary census evidence confirms that the owners of the 136.2-acre tract between 1908 and
1916 likely used the parcel for agriculture and/or leased it out to tenants. Historians were unable
to find an entry for L.E. Conner or Cormen in the 1900 or 1910 Runnels or Coleman County census
records, but his brief association with the parcel and description as a Runnels County resident in
both the 1905 and 1908 transactions suggests he did not occupy the tract. Similarly, the Longs do
not appear to have resided on the property. Ben Long appears in the 1910 Runnels County census
as a resident of Ballinger. He lived with his wife, daughter, and an African American servant, and the
100006286/110039

113

V. Results
record lists his occupation as “merchant and land.” His obvious wealth, residency in an urban area,
and occupation as a land investor suggest he did not occupy the parcel.

Numerous individuals appear in the 1910 census that could correlate to J.A. Long, who purchased
the subject tract in 1910; however, it does not appear that any of the individuals occupied the
property. Four individuals (John Long, John Long, Joe Long, and Jay Long) lived in various portions
of Runnels County, and James Long, the only Coleman County resident, was a 22-year-old hired
hand working on the farm of Orville Wilcox. His young age and apparent lack of means to purchase
a parcel for $3,100 only to sell it months later suggests the young James Long was likely not
associated with the parcel. Finally, G.W. White, who owned the property between 1910 and 1916,
resided in Ballinger in Runnels County in 1910. He lived with his family, and his occupation was
listed as “own income,” suggesting he was independently wealthy. Historians did not find an entry
for the White family in the 1920 Coleman or Runnels County census records.

Conversely, it appears that Aldon Brookshier may have occupied the 136.2-acre tract after his
acquisition of it in 1916. In 1920, Auldon Brookshire [sic] (24) appears as a Coleman County
resident in associated census records. He lived with his wife Helen (20) in an unincorporated
portion of the county and farmed property he owned. His wife worked as a teacher at the common
school. Historians were unable to find an entry for the family in the 1930 Texas census records, and
though a deed was not found of record, they sold the 136.2 acres to W.F. Brown some time prior to
1952.
W.F. Brown, a resident of Coleman County, had purchased the adjacent 133-acre tract (Block 16)
out of the Matthews subdivision from a number of the Matthews heirs in 1916 (Coleman County
Deed Records 94:159). A previous deed of trust on the 133 acres (and eight other tracts) for the
benefit of W.N. Gourley of Alpine, Texas, minor heir of the Matthews estate, indicates the property
remained undeveloped during its association with the Matthews family (Coleman County Deed of
Trust Records N:480). Though it is unclear when Brown acquired the 136.2-acre parcel, he owned
both of the subject tracts by the time of his death circa 1952 (Coleman County Deed Records
317:616). As they were the only tracts he owned, they likely constituted his home and farmstead.
This assessment is supported by the current owner, who remembers the property contained “the
Brown place” before her grandfather purchased it in the 1950s (Jones 2011). Though historians
were unable to find an entry for him in the 1920 Coleman County census records, in 1930, Wesley F.
Brown (55) headed a household containing his brother Arthur A. (41) and sisters Mattie E. (52) and
Ada M. (50). Brown owned his property, which was valued at $2,240, and he and his brother are
listed as farmers.
In summary, the parcels associated with site 41CN289 appear to have constituted some portion of
the Matthews family ranch during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Both were
likely undeveloped pastureland during this period. After 1905, the 136.2-acre tract could have been
occupied by L.E. Conner (Corman) and/or associated tenants (1905-1908), and/or tenants working

100006286/110039

V. Results
for Ben S. Long (1908–1910), J.A. Long (1910), and/or G.W. White (1910–1916). It is also possible
that the land remained pasture during this period. After 1916, it could have been occupied by the
Aldon Brookshier family for an unknown period of time. It appears that both the 133-acre and the
136.2-acre tracts were associated with W.F. Brown during the early twentieth century. Brown and
his siblings likely occupied the property and used it for agriculture until his death circa 1952.While
it is depicted on the 1922 Coleman County Soils Map (USDA, Bureau of Soils [BoS] 1922), no
structure is visible in this locale on any of the later maps (no 1930s highway map was available for
this area).

Conclusion

While the eligibility of site 41CN289 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of
the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41CN290

Site 41CN290 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on the slope of an upland ridge overlooking the
Elm Creek floodplain, roughly 600 m (1,968 ft) to the northeast; the area is thus designated as an
HPA. Soils within the area are mapped as Kavett and Talpa soils, undulating (USDA, SCS 1974), and
have mostly been eroded by wind and water, resulting in little soil deposition. At the time of the
survey, surface visibility was limited to 10 percent by low grasses, cacti, and scattered mesquite
(Figure 81). A two-track road runs along the northwestern edge of the site area, which is currently
used for livestock grazing.
Fifteen shovel tests were placed to test the site boundaries. Two of these were positive, each with
one chert flake at a maximum depth of 15 cmbs (5.9 inches) (Table 12). Surface artifacts were
found in very low density and included a possible chert chopper and eight thin chert flakes, three of
which displayed possible expedient modification. No features were observed, and no diagnostic
materials were present. Based on the extent of surface materials and the shovel testing program, a
site area of roughly 25 m (80 ft) northeast-southwest by 50 m (160 ft) northwest-southeast was
established (Figure 82). The site continues outside of the ROW to the southwest.
Due to the availability of chert resources but the relatively high distance to a water source, the site
most likely functioned as a lithic procurement area. However, it lacks soils, features, and diagnostic
artifacts. While the eligibility of site 41CN290 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the
portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional
investigation.

41CN291
Site 41CN291 is a historic farmstead located along Farm-to-Market Road 1026 approximately
0.5 km north of the town of Fisk. It is situated on a gentle slope overlooking an ephemeral feeder of
Bull Creek, roughly 0.5 km (0.3 mile) to the southwest, in an area mapped as an HPA. Soils of the
types Kimbrough and Mereta, undulating, predominate (USDA, SCS 1974). Thick grasses and low
mesquite trees contributed to limiting surface visibility to less than 5 percent at the time of the
survey (Figure 83).

Figure 83. Overview of site 41CN291.
Domestic artifacts were found strewn along the surface in a density of roughly two to three pieces
per square meter (11 ft2). These included six clear glass bottles, likely for beverages, condiments, or
medicine; one of these, an absorbine bottle created for the W.F. Young Company by the Owens
Bottle Company, dates to 1923 (Toulouse 1971). Less than 20 fragments of salt-glazed stoneware
and ironstone were observed, along with one piece of refined earthenware with decalcomania
decoration in floral relief. Also present were a kettle and iron bedsprings. Eight shovel tests were
excavated, with two tests containing historic artifacts (e.g., solarized glass, an iron cut nail, and a
fragment of decorated whiteware) to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs (11.8 inches) (Table 13). Based
on surface observation, shovel testing, and the road, the site measures roughly 60 m (197 ft) eastwest; its north-south extent is limited to 50 m (160 ft) north-south based on ROW boundaries
(Figure 84).

A bell-shaped limestone-and-mortar cistern (Figure 85) is the only feature remaining intact; it
measures 1.4 m above modern ground surface, and extends approximately 5.6 m below ground
surface. No structures remain, but large push piles are now present where the house and possible
outbuildings were cleared. Construction debris consisted of fragments of red brick, concrete, and
possible pier stones of tabular limestone.

Historic Research
The site is currently under use as pasture and displays a high degree of disturbance from
mechanical clearing. It appears to date to at least the early twentieth century, most likely post1904, when the town of Fisk was founded (Hunt 2010). A residence appears on the 1922 Coleman
County Soils Map in this location (USDA, BoS 1922), but is nonexistent by 1959 (TSHD 1961b).

Historians did not have chain of title information for the tract containing site 41CN291; however,
communication with the current landowner suggests it was associated with occupation of the
property by the Whitfield family during the early twentieth century. Landowner James Tisdale
indicated the site contained the Whitfield family’s residence before his grandfather bought the
property circa 1944. According to Mr. Tisdale, Dee and Molly Whitfield raised their children on the
property, which included a wooden pier-and-beam house, barns, and livestock pens. Mr. Tisdale
speculated that the property was occupied beginning in the 1910s or 1920s. He further stated that
he believed the house was originally two stories tall and may have served as a rooming house until
the second story was damaged by a tornado and removed. When Mr. Tisdale’s grandfather
purchased the property, FM 1026 was a dirt road, and the residence was one story. His grandfather
subsequently moved the house to the south end of the property and had it renovated. It still stands
today (Tisdale 2011).

Review of contemporary census records confirms that the Whitfields lived in an unincorporated
portion of Coleman County during the period, but indicates that they would have been tenants on
the property between 1920 and 1930. The couple first appears in the 1920 Coleman County census
records. In that year, they lived in Justice Precinct 3, and the household included Dee W. (26), Mollie
(26), Major D. (2), and Nell R. (4 months). Dee’s occupation was listed as farmer. The family was
still renting property in 1930 when the household had expanded to include Dee W. (38), Mollie

(36), Major (12), Nellrose (10), and Bennie C. (7). Dee was a farmer, and the family lived one
household from W.M. and Mary A. Whitfield along the Gouldbuck and Coleman Road. The
Whitfields, who were both 76, owned their property, and their age suggests they may have been
Dee Whitfield’s parents. It is possible that the elder Whitfields owned the subject property at the
time.

Conclusion

Historians encountered no evidence that the Whitfields were significant to local development or
that the residence formerly located at the site operated as a rooming house. Additionally, there was
no evidence that the site was associated with significant events or trends. Due to the site’s
condition, the absence of standing structures, and its lack of historical significance, its further
research potential is limited. While the eligibility of site 41CN291 as a whole cannot be determined
at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit
additional investigation.

41CN292

Site 41CN292 is a small historic site located in a low-lying area roughly 75 m to the south of an
intermittent drainage; due to the proximity of the latter, the area is designated as an HPA. Soils
within this area are mapped as Tarrant and Purves soils, undulating (USDA, SCS 1974). Vegetation
is composed of short grasses and abundant mesquite, with a resulting ground surface visibility of
100006286/110039

V. Results
less than 5 percent. The site lies just south of an area that has been heavily bulldozed to create a
stock pond.

Overall, the site extends approximately 50 m (160 ft) north-south by 40 m (131 ft) east-west, as
determined by shovel testing and surface inspection (Figure 86). Of the seven shovel tests
excavated, only one produced cultural material (Table 14). The site is composed of a light scatter of
glass—colorless, aqua, solarized (Figure 87); some of which is embossed—as well as ceramics
(ironstone, Albany slip), machine-pressed brick (unstamped), and modern refuse (e.g., beer bottles
and plastic bags). Artifacts were found in a density of one piece per square meter (11 ft2). A low
linear pile of large limestone blocks lies along the site’s eastern margin, between the scatter and
CR 320 (Figure 88). It is unknown as to whether the pile was intended to be a boundary wall or is
simply the result of dozing and clearing.

Historic Research
Site 41CN292 is located on a portion of two tracts (61.2 and 62.22 acres) within the original
Coleman County School land grant (Abstract 746) in Coleman County, Texas. The parcels are parts
of larger 71.36 and 71.48-acre tracts respectively that also include land within the A. Byrd Survey
(Abstracts 1016 and 1017); however, the site is located on the portion of the property within the
School Land survey. According to GLO Records, the “Coleman County School Land” patented their
3,135.11-acre survey on July 28, 1879 (GLO Records, Coleman County Abstract 746). The sale of
school lands to the public began in 1874, and through 1905, “the price, amount of land available,
method of purchase, and eligibility requirements varied greatly.” Sometimes residency was
required to purchase land, though in some west Texas counties this was not always the case (GLO
n.d.3). It is unclear when the subject parcel was first partitioned from the 3,135.11-acre survey;
however, its status as unappropriated public domain prior to the late nineteenth century indicates
it remained undeveloped during that period.

The parcels associated with site 41CN292 were partitioned from lands owned by the Simonton
family in the early twentieth century. W.T. and Mary Simonton purchased 160 acres containing
portions of the Coleman County School Land Survey (Abstract 746), the A. Byrd Survey (Abstracts
1016 and 1017), and the Galveston, Houston, and Henderson (G.H. &H.) Railroad Survey (Abstract
295) from Polly Moore, a widow, Dear A. and I.A. Click, Fannie and Fred Ehrler, J.H. and Lena Moore,

W.L. and Laura Moore, and J.A. and Dora Moore, all of Coleman County, and Juniatta and B.D.
Whitley, residents of Bell County, in January of 1916. The individuals were the heirs of Jesse Moore,
and Simonton paid $5,600 for the property (Coleman County Deed Records 93:310).

Simonton acquired another, adjacent 144-acre tract, which also included land in the Coleman
County School Land Survey, the A. Byrd Survey, and the G.H. & H. Railroad Survey, from J.L. and Lou
Bohannon in 1924 for $8,640 (Coleman County Deed Records 134:536). The Bohannons, described
as residents of Coleman County in the records, had owned the 144 acres since 1916 when they
purchased the property from J.R. and Susie B. Fine, also of Coleman County, for $6,480. The
transaction describes the parcel as being situated along the Coleman and Colorado River Road
(Coleman County Deed Records 96:283). Census records indicate that the Fines lived in the town of
Silver Valley in 1910 and had relocated to the town of Coleman by 1920. Their continued
association with urban areas suggests they did not live on the property. The subject parcels were
originally part of these two tracts.

Contemporary census evidence suggests that the Simontons may have been tenants on the Moore’s
property prior to acquiring it in 1916 and that they likely continued to lived there in subsequent
years. In 1910, Jesse H. (59) and Pollie (60) Moore lived on property they owned in an
unincorporated portion of Coleman County within Justice Precinct 3. Jesse’s occupation was listed
as “own income,” suggesting he was independently wealthy. The Simontons, including William T.
(43), Mary C. (34), Anna L. (13), George D. (11), Sam S. (9), William T. (7), Edwin T. (3), and Ruby E.
(10 months), lived one household from the Moores on property they rented. William T. Simonton
worked as a farmer. A number of the Moores’ children also lived in the immediate vicinity on
property they rented, suggesting they worked on their parents’ land. In addition to numerous other

100006286/110039

125

V. Results
renters, the families of James H. and Lena Moore, John A. and Dora I. Moore, Fred and Fannie Ehrler,
and William L. and Laura Moore, were enumerated on the same census sheet as Jesse and Polly
Moore and the Simontons. It is possible that Mary Simonton was also the Moores’ daughter and that
the Simontons acquired the property from Jesse Moore’s estate after his death.

It also appears that the Bohannons lived on their portion of the property after acquiring it. In 1910,
Joe Bohanan [sic] (37) rented a farm in Justice Precinct 1. His household included wife Lou (27) and
children Raymon (5), Elbert (3), and Lurline (7 months). By 1920, Bohannon lived on property he
owned two households from the Simontons in Justice Precinct 3. In that year, the household
included Joseph L. Bohannon (47), Louisa (37), their children Raymon J. (14), Emma L. (10), Robert
E. (4), Thomas E. (2.5), and Travis B. (2 months), and his sister-in-law Rebecca Criss (49).
Bohannon was a farmer and owned his property. The Bohannons household was separated from
that of the Simontons by the household of Levi and Laura Moore. This continued connection with
the Moore family suggests they were still living in the same place. In 1920, the Simonton household
included William T. (57), Mary M. (44), Anna (23), Sam S. (19), Edwin (12), Ruby (10), Eula M. (8),
Maggie (6), Fred (4), and Jessie (2). Simonton worked as a farmer and is enumerated as a property
owner.

By 1930, 6 years after they sold a portion of the subject property to Simonton, the Bohannons lived
back in Precinct 1 on property they owned. Historians were unable to find an entry for the
Simonton family in the 1930 census, but deed records indicate that they owned the property until
William Simonton’s death sometime before 1948. In March of that year, his wife Mary, acting as the
executor of his estate, conveyed the 144-acre and 160-acre tracts (304 acres total) to T.E. Simonton
and Willie Anna Simonton for $19,760 (Coleman County Deed Records 274:594). It is unclear how
long they retained the property, but by 1964, the Veterans Land Board of Texas owned the portion
of the tract containing the subject site. In that year, the board conveyed the property to C.L.
Derryberry for $7,200 cash (Coleman County Deed Records 421:567). Clifford and Lucille
Derryberry sold the property, including 62.1-acre and 62.22-acre tracts in the Coleman County
School Land Survey, to Jimmie Jamison the same month (Coleman County Deed Records 422:299).
Jamison retains the property at present (Coleman County Deed of Trust Records 167:1006).
Archival evidence indicates site 41CN292 could have been associated with occupation of the subject
property by a member of the Moore family (pre 1916), the Simontons (1916–1948), and/or the
Bohannons (1916–1924). Census evidence also suggests that the Simontons may have occupied the
property as tenants in the employ of the Moore family prior to their acquisition of it in 1916. As no
structures are depicted at the site’s location on historic maps, however, it is possible that the site
represents a secondary deposit associated with any or all of the individuals’ use of the land during
the early to mid-twentieth century.

V. Results

Conclusion
Historians encountered no evidence that any of the individuals associated with the site were
significant to local development and/or that it maintained associations with important historic
trends. Because of the poor condition of the site and its lack of standing structures or archeological
integrity, its potential for significant research is highly limited. Therefore, site 41CN292 does not
appear to be eligible for listing in the NRHP and does not merit additional investigation.

41CN293

Site 41CN293 represents the remains of a historic home site located along CR 309. It is situated on
relatively level uplands overlooking an ephemeral drainage, which lies roughly 300 m (1,000 ft) to
the northwest; the area is consequently mapped as an MPA. Kavett silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes,
is mapped in the area and yielded little soils deposition (USDA, SCS 1974). Plowed fields surround
the site, which was vegetated at the time of the survey by dense grasses and mesquite, which
limited surface visibility to less than 5 percent.

A roughly 25-m (82-ft)-diameter scatter of red bricks, tabular limestone blocks, and sheet metal
appears to be the remains of a house, but its original location is not clear (Figure 89). What appears
to be a single brick pier is situated amidst upright wooden posts in the center of the site. A
rectangular depression in the earth, measuring roughly 4 m (13 ft) north-south by 6 m (20 ft) eastwest and 1 m (3.3 ft) deep), may represent a root cellar. The site’s most-intact feature is a bellshaped brick-and-mortar cistern, roughly 5 m (16 ft) deep and 0.85 m (2.8 ft) in diameter (Figure
90). Twelve shallow shovel tests, four of which were positive for cultural materials (Table 15), were
excavated to supplement surface observation and a fence line, and provide a north-south extent of
about 60 m (197 ft) north-south. The site’s east-west boundaries were determined by the 50-m
(160-ft)-wide ROW, beyond which it appears to extend.

Artifacts at the site included two red bricks, the rusted iron frame of a vehicle, three green and clear
glass bottles (Owens-Illinois), and a 1938 license plate. Of the bricks found at the site, two
manufacturing stamps were found. One, a five-point star-shaped stamp, likely represents the Texas
Press Brick Company of the city of Ferris, Ellis County, which operated between 1909 and 1926
(Steinbomer 1982, type 1). A second displays a stamped triangle, likely a product of the Thurber
Brick Company of Erath County, which was in operation between 1903 to 1933 (Steinbomer 1982,
type 255 or 256).

Historic Research
Site 41CN293 is located on a 371.36-acre parcel within the original Thomas Moffett Survey
(Abstract 502) in Coleman County, Texas. This 371.36 acre tract comprises four separate tracts of
162.2 acres, 50 acres, 45.8 acres, and 117.8 acres. The identified archeological site is located on the
162.2-acre tract. Archeological evidence and historic map research suggests that site 41CN293
represents the remnants of an early-twentieth-century homestead. It is present on the 1922
Coleman County Soils Map (USDA, BoS 1922) and the 1936 Coleman County General Highway Map
100006286/110039

V. Results
(TSHD 1940b). By 1959 (TSHD 1961b), the site does not appear as a residence, and it is depicted on
the 1964 Fisk 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map only as an outbuilding.

The heirs of Thomas Moffett patented the 640-acre Travis 3rd-class headright containing site
41CN293 on January 29, 1861 (GLO Records, Coleman County Abstract 502). Third-class headrights
were issued to individuals who arrived in Texas between October 1, 1837 and January 4, 1840.
Typically, heads of families received 640 acres, and single men received 320 acres (GLO n.d.1). No
Moffetts are enumerated in the census records for Coleman County from 1860 through 1930.
Although the names of Thomas Moffett’s heirs are not known, it is unlikely that they ever occupied
his headright.

It is unclear when Moffett’s heirs began to partition the headright and sell the property, but by
1904, Adam T. Brown owned the 162.2-acre portion of the subject parcel including site 41CN293
and several surrounding tracts within the survey (Coleman County Deed Records 55:93, 645:19,
206:558–59). Adam T. Brown is listed in the 1900 Coleman County census records as a 44-year-old
stockman living in the town of Coleman. This record indicates that he owned his home without a
mortgage and classified his home as a house rather than a farm. Brown’s residence in Coleman, his
occupation as a stockman, and his vast landholdings suggest that the subject tract remained
undeveloped and/or that it was leased out to tenants or used for cattle grazing during the period. In
1904, D.L. Riley, of Ellis County, purchased the 162.2-acre property from Brown for $2027.00 in
cash and promissory notes. The high value of the property suggests that it included improvements
(Coleman County Deed Records 55:93).

Dave L. Riley is listed in the 1910 Coleman County Census as a 31-year-old farmer living in Precinct
7 with his wife Addie and three children. This record indicates that while he owned his property,
which was designated as a farm, the property was mortgaged. This record also indicates that the
Riley family lived in close proximity to the Field family, who was known to have owned property
adjacent to the subject tract, suggesting they occupied the property (Coleman County Deed Records
136:246). No conveyance from Riley was located in the Coleman County Deed Records, but the
1920 Coleman County Census records indicate that Riley continued to reside in Coleman County,
and several of the neighboring households enumerated in this record were known landowners in
the area including the Field and Rude families (Coleman County Deed Records 193:84 and 55:93).
This evidence suggests that the Rileys continued to live on or near the property through 1920. By
1930, census records indicate that Riley had relocated to the town of Coleman and lived on West
Live Oak Street.
By 1954, the property was owned by Pinkney J. and Dezina Reeves of Coleman County. Although it
is unknown when the Reeveses acquired the property, the 1910 Falls County Census lists Pinkney
Reeves as a resident of his father’s household in Falls County. The 1920 Coleman County census
indicates that he lived in Precinct 3 in his father’s household near several known landholders in the
vicinity of site 41CN293. This census data and subsequent deed evidence suggests that the Reeves
100006286/110039

V. Results
family acquired the subject tract sometime around 1920 and continued to own the property
through the 1990s when J. Bryant Reeves, son of Pinkney Reeves sold the property to Charles and
Juanita Hudgins (Coleman County Deed Records 645:19). According to the 1930 Coleman County
census, the Reeves family continued to reside in the project area through 1930 along “Reeves
Community Road.” It is unknown if this roadway correlates to any extant roads in the area. Pinkney
Reeves, his wife Dezina Josephine, and his parents are all buried in the Brown Ranch Cemetery,
which is located approximately 0.5 mile north of site 41CN293 (Terry 1998). It is likely that the
Reeves family occupied the property from circa 1920 through at least 1930 and possibly much
longer. As a result, site 41CN293 could have associated with occupations of the associated parcel by
the Riley family (1904-before 1930) and/or the Reeves family (post-1920).
Neither of these families is known to have been significant to local or regional development.
Additionally, historians encountered no evidence that the site was associated with significant
events or historic trends. The site is an early-twentieth-century homestead that has been impacted
heavily by what appears to be mechanical clearing, and to a lesser extent, grazing and erosion.
Because of the paucity of archeological integrity and standing structures as well as the lack of any
significant historical connections, the site appears to lack much potential for producing further
information. While the eligibility of site 41CN293 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the
portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional
investigation.

41CN294

Site 41CN294 is a multicomponent prehistoric and historic site located on a high ridge overlooking
Home Creek. An ephemeral drainage is roughly 100 m (328 ft) to the south, but Home Creek,
approximately 800 m (2,625 ft) to the northeast, would have been the most reliable water source;
due to the former, however, the area is considered to be an HPA. Shallow gravelly soils of the
Tarrant and Purves series, undulating are mapped within the project area (USDA, SCS 1974). Sparse
grasses and mesquite formed the major vegetation at the time of the survey, resulting in 50 percent
surface visibility.

The site was discovered by surface observation and consisted of a thin scatter of lithic debitage and
historic domestic material. A program of six shovel tests was conducted to determine the site’s
extent, all proving negative for cultural remains. From this and a perusal of the surface, site
boundaries were found to be roughly 75 m (240 ft) northwest-southeast and 50 m (160 ft)
southwest-northeast (ROW boundaries) (Figure 91). The site scatter extends beyond the ROW to
the northeast and southwest.

100006286/110039

131

V. Results
The prehistoric artifact assemblage included 2 lithic bifaces and less than 30 pieces of debitage,
mainly of secondary and tertiary manufacturing stage (Figure 92). Of the more than 50 pieces of
glass observed—of clear, solarized, and dark blue varieties—two bottle necks had applied finishes
of the oil and wine types, and two bases displayed embossing, albeit fragmentary (Figure 93). Metal
found at the site included pieces of iron plumbing as well as the front grate of an iron stove, a
product of Bridge, Beach & Company of St. Louis. Ceramics consisted of porcelain, whiteware, and
stoneware, totaling less than 20 pieces. A line of old fence posts runs southwest-northeast across
the site and may be associated with its historic component.

Site 41CN194 most likely represents both a prehistoric lithic quarry and a late-nineteenth- or earlytwentieth-century homestead. A structure in this vicinity is visible on the 1922 Coleman County
Soils Map (USDA, BoS 1922), but not on one from 1936 (TSHD 1940b) or later maps. According to
the landowner, George Wheatley, his father D.P. Wheatley purchased the property in 1923 from
M.D. Eubank and his wife. The site was likely associated with a house that was on the property prior
to that year, and which was subsequently moved to a new location.
The prehistoric component within the ROW lacks archeological integrity, diagnostics, and features,
and the historic structure on the property has been removed from the site area, leaving only
domestic refuse. While the eligibility of site 41CN294 as a whole cannot be determined at this time,
the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional
investigation.

41CN295

Site 41CN295 consists of the remnants of a historic homestead. Situated on a relatively level upland
plain, it is located within a clearing of oak trees, mesquite, scattered cactus, and dense grasses,
which prevented surface visibility at the time of the survey. The nearest reliable water source is
over 300 m (1,000 ft) to the northwest, thus categorizing this area as an MPA. Area soils have been
mapped as belonging to the Speck and Tarrant series, undulating; both types are shallow and
overlie limestone bedrock (USDA, SCS 1974).
Thirteen shovel tests were excavated to determine the site’s horizontal and vertical extent; all
encountered shallow soils but no cultural materials. Based on these and the extent of observed
surface artifacts, the limits of the site within the ROW were determined to be 100 m (328 ft)
northwest-southeast by 50 m (160 ft) southwest-northeast (Figure 94). A power line extends
across the project area to terminate just south of the structure outside of the ROW, and the surface
materials suggest that the site also continues to the northeast.

All that remains of the original structure itself are a chimney (Figure 95), a possible pier of
mortared limestone blocks, and a pile of unstamped machine-made red bricks. No identifying
stamps were observed on the bricks. A cement-lined cistern lies just to the northeast, and appears
to be constructed of brick. Several piles of relatively recent trash are also present, including screwtop bottles of clear, brown, and green glass, various metal scraps, barrels, and several appliances,
some of which may have been burned during the destruction of the house or later brush clearing.

Figure 95. Overview of site 41CN295, facing northeast.
The structure at site 41CN295 appears on the 1922 Coleman County Soils Map (USDA, BoS 1922)
and possibly on the 1936 Coleman County General Highway Map (TSHD 1940b). It is not present on
the 1959 Coleman County General Highway map (TSHD 1961b), which likely only depicts
residences, but does appear on the Speck Mountain 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map as an
outbuilding (1962 with revisions in 1987 and 2010).

Historic Research

Though chain of title information for the parcel containing site 41CN295 was unavailable;
historians were able to contact the current landowner and local informants who provided some
information about the history of the property. Landowner Anton Friske indicated that site 41CN295
represented the remains of the “Old Ellis Place.” Mr. Friske stated that when he bought the property
12 to 15 years ago, the residence was still standing but that it was consumed in a fire 5 or 6 years
ago. At present, the chimney is all that remains of the former dwelling. Mr. Friske provided contact
information for Jerry Ellis, who he believed had grown up at the site (Friske 2011). Historians
100006286/110039

136

V. Results
contacted Mr. Ellis who confirmed he lived in the area but not at the dwelling formerly located at
site 41CN295. He indicated that his family had occupied an adjacent tract. Mr. Ellis maintained that
the Wallace family had occupied the residence associated with site 41CN295 during the 1920s and
1930s. Mr. Ellis further indicated that the house was wood pier-and-beam construction and that a
small barn was located to the west (Ellis 2011).

Mr. Ellis supplied the name of Joe Wallace (around 85 years of age) for further information and
stated that the neighboring property had been occupied by the Fletcher family (Ellis 2011).
Attempts to contact Mr. Wallace were unsuccessful, but a review of the 1930 Coleman County
census records found the family of D.L. Wallace, including his wife Minnie and seven children—
among them Joe Lee Wallace (born ca. 1923)—residing next to the family of William B. Fletcher
along Wallace Road in Justice Precinct 7. This evidence confirms the information provided by the
oral informant and the time period suggested by the archeological and historic map evidence. Mr.
Wallace owned his property and was engaged in farming.

Review of earlier census records indicates that the Wallace family likely occupied the property from
as early as 1910 when Dock L. Wallace (29) appears in the Coleman County census records as the
head of a household containing his wife Minnie (24) and their two children Bessie (1) and Grover
(2 months). Wallace owned his property, and the family lived near two other families of Wallaces in
Justice Precinct 7. The family continued to live in Justice Precinct 7 in 1920 when the household had
expanded to include Dock L. (39), Minnie (33), Bessie L. (11), Dock (10), Martin J. (6), and Gladys F.
(2). Wallace was still indexed as a property owning farmer. Taken together, the information
provided by local informants and the census data indicate that site 41CN295 was associated with
an occupation by the Wallace family during the early twentieth century.

Conclusion

Historians encountered no evidence that the Wallace family was significant locally or that the site
was associated with important events or historic trends. Because of the site’s current state and the
preclusion of intact archeological deposits, significant research potential is unlikely. While the
eligibility of site 41CN295 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that
lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41CN296

Site 41CN296 is a scatter of prehistoric lithic debitage in an area designated as an HPA. The site is
located atop a low rise that has been heavily dissected and eroded by intermittent drainages on its
western, northern, and eastern sides. The SCS has categorized the area as Badland, which
comprises clays and shales, and features gullies and escarpments heavily eroded by wind and water
(USDA, SCS 1974). Sandstone is exposed on the surface, which is littered with hematite, limestone,
and chert cobbles. Vegetation at the time of the survey consisted only of widely scattered grasses
and stunted junipers, allowing very high surface visibility (Figure 96).
100006286/110039

137

V. Results

Figure 96. Overview of site 41CN296, facing northwest.
The site’s northwest-southeast limits were determined by surface observation to cover the
landform, roughly 65 m (213 ft) in length; its width occupied the entire 50-m (160-ft) ROW and
extended beyond it to the southwest (Figure 97). The lack of soils precluded shovel testing. Lithic
debitage was found across the landform in a density of approximately one to two pieces per square
meter. Flakes were abundant within the drainage as well, but these were likely washed down from
the landform. Of the debitage present, 20 percent were of primary stage of manufacture, 60 percent
of secondary, and 20 percent of tertiary, with most of the flakes measuring up to 4 cm in length.
Site 41CN296 has been heavily disturbed by erosion, which has severely compromised its
archeological integrity. No diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were observed. While the
eligibility of site 41CN296 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that
lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

41CN297

Prehistoric site 41CN297 is located along the south toe of a low escarpment above the head of a
small ephemeral drainage, in an area marked as an HPA. The drainage eventually feeds into
Mukewater Creek, roughly 550 m (1,800 ft) to the east. The shallow Tarrant and Purves soils,
undulating, are mapped within the site area (USDA, SCS 1974). Bedrock was exposed in some areas,
but low grasses within the shallow soils limited ground visibility to about 30 percent at the time of
survey (Figure 98).
100006286/110039

138

V. Results

Figure 98. Overview of site 41CN297.
Seven shovel tests, all negative, were used to test the site boundaries. These were determined to be
about 20 m (66 ft) east-west by 25 m (82 ft) north-south based on surface observation, which also
confirmed that the site extends beyond the ROW boundary to east (Figure 99). Approximately 30
pieces of chert debitage were present, as well as one core and scattered tested cobbles. No
diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were observed.

Site 41CN297 likely represents a lithic procurement site, though its exact function is not known.
Soils made shallow by erosion and disturbance from grazing and possible clearing preclude the
possibility of intact archeological integrity, and the paucity of the artifact assemblage suggests that
research potential is limited. While the eligibility of site 41CN297 as a whole cannot be determined
at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit
additional investigation.

41CN298

Site 41CN298 is a prehistoric lithic scatter situated on the eastern bank of Hay Creek. Soils within
the area are mapped as Purves and Owens soils, undulating (USDA, SCS 1974), and have mostly
been eroded by wind and water, resulting in little soil deposition and frequent surface exposure of
sandstone bedrock. Vegetation consisted mainly of low grasses, mesquite, and cacti, with scattered
hackberries along the creek’s edge. At the time of the survey, surface visibility ranged between 50
and 90 percent, depending on grass and leaf cover. A fenceline bisects the site from east to west,
and a bermed stock tank is present at its southeast corner (Figure 100).
100006286/110039

140

V. Results
Twenty-one shovel tests were attempted (Table 16), the majority of which terminated in sandstone
bedrock at a maximum depth of 10 cm (3.9 inches); three of these were positive, producing one
piece of chert debitage each. Surface artifacts were observed scattered sparsely across the site area
and included approximately 50 pieces of chert debitage and a single early-stage biface. Of the
debitage, roughly 5 percent was of primary stage of manufacture, 35 percent of secondary, and 60
percent tertiary, with a few specimens exhibiting signs of heat treatment; two pieces exhibited
possible expedient edge modification. No features were observed, and no diagnostic materials were
present. Based on the extent of surface materials, the shovel testing program, and the ROW
boundaries, a site area of roughly 200 m (656 ft) north-south by 50 m (160 ft) east-west was
established. The site likely continues outside of the ROW in both directions. Shovel tests placed
west of Hay Creek during the previous survey phases encountered no cultural resources.

Based on its proximity to Hay Creek, the site most likely represents an open-air campsite. However,
the lack of soils, features, and diagnostic artifacts precludes the site’s potential to contribute
significantly to the knowledge of the area’s prehistoric record. While the eligibility of site 41CN298
as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current
ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

MONITORING

Of the transmission line’s 435 proposed tower structures, 26 were chosen for monitoring of
construction due to their locations within or near the floodplains of Bluff, Elm, Gap, Long Branch,
Mud, Mustang, Home, Hay, and Mukewater creeks, as well as some of their larger tributaries (Table
17; Appendix B). Most of the structures are lattice steel V-towers, each with foundations supported
by four buried cement corner footings. The holes for these footings were typically 0.6 m (2 ft) in
diameter, with depths ranging from 4.3 to 5.5 m (14 to 18 ft) depending upon the unique
engineering requirements at each structure location. In limited cases, foundation construction
varied, with one, two, or eight auger holes measuring up to 1.8 m (6 ft) in diameter and over 9.8 m
(32 ft) in depth. Examination of the auger holes yielded no evidence of buried soil horizons or
cultural features. No artifacts were found within the backdirt of any of the monitored towers.

VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
The cultural resource investigations conducted in connection with the proposed Oncor Bluff Creek
to Brown Transmission Line Project revisited 3 previously recorded sites and identified 43
previously unrecorded cultural resource sites with the potential of being impacted by the project.

The survey revisited prehistoric sites 41TA23, 41TA26, and 41TA269, and identified27 prehistoric
sites—41TA285–41TA295, 41RN245, 41RN249–41RN253, 41RN255, 41RN256, 41RN260,
41RN264, 41RN265, 41CN288, 41CN290, and 41CN296–41CN298, 12 historic sites—41RN246–
41RN248, 41RN257, 41RN258, 41RN262, 41RN263, 41CN289, 41CN291, 41CN292, and
41CN295—and 4 sites with both prehistoric and historic components—41RN254, 41RN259,
41RN261, and 41CN294.

Sites 41TA288, 41RN247, 41RN263, and 41CN292, whose boundaries have been fully defined, do
not appear eligible for listing in the NRHP. The eligibility of each of the other 42 sites cannot be
determined at this time, as they extend beyond the limits of the current project area; however,
based on the recorded portions of these sites, no additional cultural resource investigations are
recommended within the ROW.
Due to the possibility of buried sites within the floodplains of the major drainages within the
project area, the construction of 26 tower structures was monitored but no cultural materials were
encountered. It is recommended that construction of the proposed Oncor Bluff Creek to Brown
transmission line be allowed to proceed. If evidence of presently undiscovered cultural remains is
encountered during the construction of the proposed transmission line, it is recommended that the
discovery be evaluated by a qualified archeologist who can provide recommendations on how to
proceed in accordance with federal and state regulations.
