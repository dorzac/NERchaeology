Excavation of Murrah Cave

EXCAVATION OF MURRAH CAVE
BY W. C. HOLDEN
Murrah Cave is located in Val Verde County, on
the lower Pecos River, approximately fifteen miles
from the Rio Grande as the crow flies, and some
twenty-five or thirty miles as the river winds. The
Pecos, in this vicinity, makes a number of horseshoe bends which have diameters ranging from
three-quarters of a mile to two miles. The cave is
in the east bank, facing west, of one of these bends
whose circular side is to the east. The river in this
region has cut several hundred feet through the
Comanchean limestone. The east bank, on the
outside curve, is practically perpendicular, with
overhanging ledges here and there, and some debris,
and very steep, near the base.
A number of caves of varying sizes are found in
this bank, but Murrah Cave, the largest of them all,
is the only one with evidence of prehistoric
occupation. It is located approximately two hundred
feet above the water level of the river, and sixty
feet from the top of the cliff. It extends back into
the cliff one hundred and twenty-four feet, is
twenty-four feet wide at its mouth, thirty-five feet
wide at a distance of forty-five feet from the
entrance, thirty-seven feet wide at sixty feet from
the entrance, and forty-five feet wide at one hundred
feet from the entrance. Toward the back it narrows
down abruptly to a passage-way only a few feet
wide which extends some twenty-four feet farther.
The floor has only a slight dip downward for fifty
feet where the decline becomes approximately thirty
percent to the rear. The ceiling in the mouth of the
cave is nine feet and six inches from the floor. It is
almost level for about eighty feet back where it
begins tilting downward. Toward the rear it is
approximately twenty-five feet from the floor.
Human occupation was confined largely to the
comparatively level stretch of floor in the front fifty
feet. Behind this the bats have lived, and the guano
is from two to three feet deep. (See Plate 7).

century. In March, 1936, Mr. W. G. McMillan and
the writer, accompanied by Mr. Puckett, visited the
cave for two days. A survey convinced us that the
site was rich in materials and had been molested
very little. Permission was granted by Mr. Jim
Murrah, the owner, to excavate the place.
We began planning an expedition for March,
1937. This season was selected as a time when
rattlesnakes would not be so active as later in the
spring, and when the weather would be neither too
hot nor too cold. As it happened, both predictions
turned out contrary to plans; we killed a rattler
under foot while eating supper one night, and two
days and nights we nearly froze, while one day was
as hot as in May.
The expedition was sent out under the auspices
of the West Texas Museum which, in turn, is under
the joint control of Texas Technological College
and the West Texas Museum Association. The
sponsors who financed the expedition were Mr. W.
G. McMillan, Dr. C. J. Wagner, Mr. H. L. Allen,
and the writer.1 These gentlemen, with the exception
of Mr. Allen, accompanied the party. In addition
was Mr. W. L. Pearson, electrical engineer, and six
students: Henry Clay Bailey III, Clifford Gibbs,
Barney McCasland, Gordon Moore, Jim Huffman,
and Winston Reeves. Mr. Reeves, a photographer
of considerable skill, made an excellent series of
pictures. The writer made the tenth member of the
expedition. Dr. John Clark, field paleontologist of
Texas Technological College, visited the site for a
short time.2

The inaccessibility of Murrah Cave made it
necessary to camp on a high rocky point several
hundred feet above the river, and a mile from the
cave. All the equipment for the cave, including the
wheelbarrows, had to be carried on our backs down
a deep canyon, up over a high ridge, down another
steep decline, and along a narrow ledge high on

well over a road which did not exist. In the camp,
not a single tent stake could be driven. It was
necessary to tie the tents to cacti, lechuguilla,
juagilla, sotol, and the other scant shrubs of desert
vegetation.

The ash heap in the forward fifty feet
of the cave varied from eighteen inches
to fifty-two inches in thickness. The
ashes were light, dry, and dusty. It was
necessary for members of the party to
wear respirators while working.
Without a respirator, one would choke
up in a few moments.
The heap was worked in three levels.
The first two levels were worked over
the entire area. When it became evident
that we would be unable to finish the
entire heap during our allotted time, we
made two trenches to the floor, one
along each side of the cave. The
trenches constituted the third level, and
gave us a representative sample of the
bottom layer. Materials from these
levels were carefully kept segregated
in order to determine whether or not
any kind of cultural change had taken
place from the bottom to the top. When

Fist Axes

Uncatalogued Flint Artifacts

Of fist axes, there were 58. These vary in length
from two and one-half inches to four inches. There
is considerable variation in shape and technique.
None show evidence of having had handles. (See
plate 8B, picture 2).

There were found 1,562 flint objects which were
not catalogued. This number included broken
projectile points other than bases, knives, scrapers,
gouges, fist axes, awls, and other unclassified items.
Many of these broken specimens are of excellent
shape and workmanship.
Pebbles

Flint Awls
Four whole awls and two broken ones were
secured. One of the whole awls had a corner-tang.
(See plate 9B, pictures 1, 2, 3, and 6).
War-Club Spikes
It is problematical whether any war spikes were
found. Two specimens may have been spikes, or
they may have been the points of broken awls. (See
plate 9B, pictures 4 and 5).
Bone Crushers

A considerable number of pebbles were found
throughout the deposit. Some 29 specimens show
evidence of having been used for rubbing. One
pebble has incised marks on it. These, however, do
not make any symbol or design.
Stone Objects
Eighteen manos were secured, but no metate
was found. This is singular in that Pearce and
Jackson got thirty-two in their rockshelter. One

something highly prized by the prehistoric
inhabitants of the cave. Professor W. I. Robinson,
Mineralogist of the Department of Geology, Texas
Technological College, examined the specimen,
found it to be non-magnetic, yet it gives a red iron
nitrate stain when touched with nitric acid. Its
specific gravity is 3.7. By grinding it with an
abrasive, it gives off a yellow powder. Professor
Robinson is of the opinion that the specimen is
limonite. He suggested that the fact a yellow
pigment could be obtained from a black mineral
was surprising enough to be regarded as magic by
the aborigines. (See plate 9A, picture 13. The highlight in the picture makes the black metallic ball
appear as a bead).

31
Human Jaw

No burials were found, however, it is possible
that some may be found in the area still to be
excavated. The only evidence of human bones was
an articular end of a lower jaw. It is significant that
this fragment was charred. This might denote one
of three facts: attempts at cremation, cannibalism,
or carelessness in handling of skeletal material by
the ancients.
Paint

Forty-one specimens of a red clay paint were
secured, the most of them were either on, or in the
vicinity of the loin cloth mentioned below.
Associated with the red clay were a number of
pieces of soft, chalky limestone which, no doubt,

Three skin-wrapped cords were found. (See
plate 12A, picture 17). Pearce and Jackson suggest
that these were probably used for blanket weaving

Leaf and Fiber Knots
A considerable use was made of leaves, split
leaves, or fibers, in the tying of bundles. The blades

(Nolina texana Watson) were used. Of 155 knots,
109 are square knots; the others were not classified.
(See plate 12A, pictures 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 13, 14 and 15). The specimen shown on plate
12A, picture 12, is quite a mystery. It consists of a
net made of hundreds of fibers tied together with
square knots. Through the center of the net is a
lechuguilla blade bent double, with the two ends
tied together at the bottom. The specimen is five
and one-half inches long, and has a fan-like
appearance. As yet we are at a loss as to its use.
Dr. R. A. Studhalter suggested it might have been
a strainer. It might also have been an ornament for
the hair.

Twenty-seven fragments of baskets came from

are shown in plate 10B. The number of weaves here

The loin cloth shown in plate 11A is ten âinches
wide and seventeen inches long, not including the

measured from four to four and one-half inches in
length. A large mummified rat was found on a
narrow ledge of the wall just below the ash level.
Several fragments of horned toads (Phrynosoma
cornutum) were secured at various depths.

The buckskin apron was on the bundle of Mormon
tea brush. The plant is known to have been used by
some American Indian groups in the treatment of
venereal diseases. Dr. Studhalter wondered if this
could be the explanation for the association of the
cloth with the bundle of tea brush.

and have a hard, smooth surface.
Needles
A considerable number of dried prickly pears
(Opuntia) were found. A piece of human dung
consisting entirely of prickly pear seeds adhered
together.
Mesquite beans (Prosopis glandulosa) were
fairly well distributed through the deposit.
Several hundred small western walnuts (Juglans
rupestris), most of them parched, were found fairly
evenly distributed through the ask heap.
A considerable number of Texas laurel or coral
beans (Sophora secundiflora), seeds, and pods were
found. The seeds, when unburned, are a coral red;
however, a majority of those secured were parched.
In view of the fact that the seeds are poisonous,
one wonders at their presence in the cave. Pearce
and Jackson give a plausible explanation.9
That the prehistoric cave dwellers liked a little
seasoning with their food is attested by the presence
of a number of small wild onions.
A few acorns, most of them parched, were found.
Three species of grass seeds (as yet unidentified)
were found.
Of considerable interest was a bundle of
Mormon tea, or teamsterâs tea (Ephedra), found
associated with the loin cloth shown on plate 11A.

Perhaps the most intriguing objects found were
two needle or spine containers. Each was made of
a bundle of soft fibers wrapped cross-wise with fiber
thongs. One (Plate 12B, picture 6) contained ten
fish-hook cactus spines. These may have been used
as fishhooks or as needles. The other bundle
contained four straight cactus spines (Plate 12B,
picture 7). Both bundles are examples of
exceedingly delicate workmanship.
Conclusion
All the evidence indicates that the inhabitants of
Murrah Cave were prehistoric. Nothing was found
to indicate they had ever come in contact with
European civilization. If the last persons to live in
the cave left before the arrival of the white race,
one may surmise from the amount of ashes that the
first inhabitants date back a considerable period
before the beginning of historic time. The people
had primarily a sotol culture, and were entirely
without pottery. Their skill lay in the making of
cordage and exquisite flint artifacts.
