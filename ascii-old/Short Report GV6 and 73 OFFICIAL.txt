ABSTRACT
On February 11, 2009, members of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) performed an intensive pedestrian survey of several parcels of privately owned land
in Crystal Beach, Galveston County, Texas. All parcels belonged to individuals who applied
to FEMA for assistance. The assisted activity for all parcels is Private Property Debris
Removal (PPDR).
The Lead Federal Agency for the project is FEMA. The goals of the cultural
resources survey were to determine if the debris removal activities would affect any
previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800).
There are two recorded archaeological sites recorded within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 mile)
of the proposed PPDR locations. One of these sites, 41GV06 is located on a proposed PPDR
site. At the request of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), FEMA conducted limited
shovel testing at this location. As a result of the investigation, a total of five shovel tests
were excavated within the parcel. No evidence of previously identified archaeological site
41GV06 was encountered. Based on the negative results of the intensive pedestrian survey,
no further work is required and the project can proceed as planned. Additionally, walkover
survey was conducted within the 41GV73 site area. Prehistoric ceramics were observed on
the beach. Based on the disturbed context of this material, it is likely that Site 41GV73 is
currently offshore. Therefore, the proposed PPDR activities on the land will not adversely
affect this archaeological site. Work should proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
On February 11, 2009, FEMA Historic Preservation Specialists performed an intensive
pedestrian survey and/or walkover survey of several privately owned properties in Crystal
Beach, Galveston County, Texas. For each of these properties, the landowner has requested
FEMA assistance to fund the removal of debris from this private property. The Lead Federal
Agency for the project is FEMA. As the survey was conducted entirely on privately owned
property, a Texas Antiquities Permit was not required. The archaeological Area of Potential
Effect (APE) was defined as all parcels that were identified within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of
previously recorded archaeological sites 41GV06 and 41GV73.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if activities required to
complete the debris removal would affect previously identified historic properties as defined by
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR
800).
PROJECT AREA
The surveyed area is located on the Caplan United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5
minute topographic quadrangle map in Galveston County, Texas (Figure 1). The parcels
examined are located on the Bolivar Peninsula in the Crystal Beach area. The area subject to
shovel testing (in the vicinity of 41GV06) is bounded to the north by a property boundary, to the
south by Highway 87, to the east by a property boundary and canal, and to the west by a property
boundary. The entire examined area was defined as all parcels that were identified within 0.8
kilometers (0.5 miles) of previously recorded archaeological sites 41GV06 and 41GV73.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Historic Preservation Specialist/Principal Investigator Rebecca Mehok led the field effort
and served as Principal Investigator for the project. Environmental/Historic Preservation
Specialist Chelsea Klein, Historic Preservation Specialist JB Pelletier, and Historic Preservation
Specialist Amber Horne assisted in the survey effort. The survey was conducted on February 11,
2009 and required approximately 48 person hours to complete. Principal Investigator Rebecca
Mehok completed site file research prior to fieldwork mobilization and also wrote the report.

SOILS
Soils in the project area include Follet loam, Mustang fine sand, and Veston loam,
slightly saline to strongly saline complex. Follet loam (Fo) is a nearly level, very poorly drained,
saline, loamy soil that has loamy subsoil; this soil is found in broad tidal marshes. Follet loam is
very slowly permeable and the surface runoff is very slow. The water table in the vicinity of this
soil is very high. Mustang fine sand (Mn) is a nearly level, poorly drained, nonsaline, sandy soil
that is found in coastal areas. Mustang fine sand is rapidly permeable above the water table, and
the water table is generally within 30.5 centimeters (12 inches) of the surface. Finally, Veston
loam (Vx), slightly saline to stronger saline complex consists of nearly level, poorly drained,
saline and loamy soils that are found on the coastal marsh flats
(http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gove/app/2009).

CULTURE HISTORY
The ceramic chronology of the Galveston Bay area includes materials that are present
both on the Upper Texas Coast and the Lower Mississippi Valley. The oldest of these ceramic
assemblages is classified as the Clear Lake Period. Ceramics were initially documented from
A.D. 100 to A.D. 425, and there is a wide variety of material recorded that includes early Goose
Creek ceramic types as well as Tchefuncte Plain and OâNeal Plain var. Conway (Aten 1983).
The Clear Lake Period is followed by the Mayes Island Period, from approximately A.D.
425 to A.D. 650 (Aten 1983). The Mayes Island Period is often misidentified as the ceramic
assemblage associated with this period is generally limited to Goose Creek Plain var. unspecified
(Aten 1983).
The Turtle Bay Period follows the Mayes Island Period, from approximately A.D. 650 to
A.D. 1000. The ceramic type that becomes prevalent during this period is the Goose Creek Red
Filmed type, with incised Goose Creek types becoming more prominent (Aten 1983).
The Round Lake Period ranges in date from approximately A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1350. The
ceramic assemblage during this period includes the emergence of some grog tempered types and
the decline of sandy paste ceramics (Aten 1983). The dominant ceramic at the end of this period
includes Baytown Plain var. Phoenix Lake.
Finally, the Old River Period follows the Round Lake Period, and ends approximately
A.D. 1700. This period is characterized by a reduction in grog tempered ceramics and an
increase in Goose Creek varieties (Aten 1983). For the Galveston Bay area, this period may be
considered the Protohistoric period, as there was some contact with Europeans and use of
European goods by native peoples (Aten 1983). This information was found in ethnographic and
historic accounts of the time. Aten suggests that the Protohistoric Period should begin between

1720 and 1740, as during this time as the Louisiana French were trading regularly with native
peoples in the Galveston Bay Area.
Historically, Galveston Island was described by Spanish explorers as early as the
sixteenth century (Kleiner 2009). The early seventeenth century brought privateers and pirates to
the island, including Jean Laffite and Louis Michael Aury. American colonists eventually came
to the island, although it remained part of Mexico until approximately 1835 (Kleiner 2009).
Galveston County was formed during the Republic of Texas Period in 1838 (Kleiner 2009). The
port of Galveston operated during this period as well, and Galveston was the most populated
county in Texas until 1900 when it was hit by a hurricane. This hurricane devastated the island
and resulted in the construction of a large seawall and the raising of the island. Railroads and
bridges were built in order to connect Galveston Island to the mainland, which encouraged
tourists to visit the island (Kleiner 2009).
The Bolivar Peninsula was named for Simon Bolivar, the first president of Bolivia
(Wiggins 2009). Point Bolivar was an important location for navigating the channel from the
Gulf of Mexico to the intercostal waterway. Fort Las Casas was constructed in the area in 1820
by James Long, and Fort Travis was constructed in the area around 1898 (Wiggins 2009). In
order to travel between Galveston Island and the peninsula, a ferry service was established in the
early part of the 1930s.
Crystal Beach, located on Bolivar Peninusla, was settled in the early twentieth century
(Daniels 2009). Formerly known as Patton, a post office operated in the area for a two year
period just before the 1900 hurricane. The majority of the residents of Crystal Beach are part
time residents, although Crystal Beach has the highest population of full time residents on the
peninsula (Daniels 2009).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Site file research was conducted by consulting on-line research archives maintained by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Research was conducted within a 0.8 kilometers (0.5
mile) study radius of the project area to identify all previously recorded archaeological sites,
historical markers and historic structures eligible for National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) listing.
The focus of this investigation was to determine if the proposed PPDR activities would
adversely affect known archaeological sites 41GV06 and 41GV73. PPDR activities will take
place in the immediate vicinity of 41GV06; PPDR activities will take place to the north of Site
41GV73.
The 41GV06 site area was subjected to intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey.
Archaeological investigations included a combination of surface (pedestrian survey) and limited
subsurface (shovel testing) testing methods. Shovel testing was focused in the area closest to
Site 41GV06.

Excavated shovel tests measured 50 centimeters (19.7 inches) in diameter and were
typically excavated into the underlying substratum, or until culturally sterile subsoil was
encountered. Removed soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth.
Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and soil color charts.
Additional information concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test
forms for each excavation.
The area around Site 41GV73 was subjected to a systematic walkover survey. Survey
transects were placed approximately 5 meters (16.4 feet) apart along the beach.
RESULTS
Site file research identified two previously identified archaeological sites within 0.8
kilometers (0.5 miles) of the project area. Site 41GV06 was located on a parcel slated for PPDR.
This site was originally identified as a shell midden that contained a large quantity of prehistoric
ceramics and lithic material including projectile points in 1966. Cultural material from 41GV06
was examined in Atenâs Indians of the Upper Texas Coast (1983). At the time the site was
recorded, the site was described as suffering from erosion and may have been destroyed when
the canal was dredged (Aten 1983). The cultural material recovered from 41GV06 was
considered important as it was the only collection available at the time of Atenâs work that had
been collected from a habitation site on the Bolivar Peninsula.
Site 41GV73 was also located within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of the proposed PPDR
locations. This site consists of a collection of prehistoric ceramics along with lithic artifacts that
were identified on the beach at the waterâs edge.
A total of three surveys were conducted within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of the proposed
PPDR locations. These include a survey for the USACE-Galveston District (1992), a survey by
Coastal Environmental for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) (2005), and a survey
by HRA Gray & Pape for TxDOT (2005). None of these surveys resulted in the identification of
any new resources.
The proposed PPDR locations all suffered from the strong winds, rain and storm surge
derived from Hurricane Ike, which made landfall September 13, 2008. The examined parcel was
likely covered with scrub shrub vegetation and beach grasses prior to the storm. At the time of
survey the entire area was covered with a layer of fine sand and storm related debris (Figures 2,
3, and 4). There were numerous uprooted trees with associated rootballs. An examination of the
rootballs did not identify any cultural material. Additionally, there were portions of the parcel
that could not be examined due to the large piles of debris which included structural/architectural
remains, white goods, and other household items. Some of the debris appeared to have been
buried as a result of the storm surge associated with the storm.

Based on the shovel test information, it appears that a layer of mottled sand was
overlaying the entire parcel. It is likely that this soil is representative of a silt layer or flood
debris. Shovel tests attempted to reach 100 centimeters (39.3 inches) below surface; however,
water was encountered prior to this depth in three of the five attempted shovel tests. Shovel
probing did not reveal the presence of buried shell or any other buried deposits. A detailed
description of these shovel test is located in Table 1.

In addition to Site 41GV06, Site 41GV73 was also in the vicinity of the proposed PPDR
properties. This site is located to the south of Highway 87 along the Gulf Coast beach. Some of
the beachfront was lost in this area. While cultural material was identified on the beach in the
site location, it is likely that this site is currently under water as a result of the storm.

SUMMARY AND RECOMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey and
walkover survey of proposed PPDR properties that were located 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) from
two previously recorded archaeological sites (41GV06 and 41GV73). FEMA has proposed to
remove surface debris from privately owned parcels in the vicinity of these sites.
Field investigation consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing within the parcels.
Subsurface investigation included the excavation of a total of five shovel tests in the vicinity of
Site 41GV06, none of which were positive for cultural material. Shovel testing did not indicate
that there was any evidence of buried shell deposits near Site 41GV06Cultural material was
identified in the 41GV73 area, however it was found on the beach. As beach area was lost in this
location, it is likely this site is currently located offshore as a result of the storm.
The results of the intensive pedestrian survey indicate that PPDR activities will not have
an adverse affect to either of these sites. Based on these results, FEMA feels that no further work
is required and that the work be allowed to proceed as planned.
