Management Summary
In April 2018, an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed William Ward Road in Springtown,
Parker County, Texas was completed in order to inventory all cultural resources prior to construction of
the new road. The project corridor is entirely located from the intersection of Knob Road and
Summerfield Court at the north end continuing south/southeast approximately 0.66 miles (1.06
kilometers) to Walnut Creek Drive. It is bordered to the north by residential development, to the south
by Walnut Creek, with pastureland, hayfields, and oilfields in between. The current archeological
project area consists of the entire footprint of the proposed William Ward Road, which is owned by
Parker County and covers approximately 8.9 acres (3.6 hectares). The new road will be four lanes,
undivided, crossing pastureland, hayfields, oilfields, and residential development.
Because the project area is owned by Parker County, a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the
survey is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (9 Texas Natural Resources Code 191), which requires
consideration of effects on properties designated as—or eligible to be designated as—State Antiquity
Landmarks, which includes archeological resources. There is no known federal nexus for this project.
Ground visibility across the project corridor ranged from 0 to 40 percent. The survey revealed the
project corridor occurs in disturbed contexts. The area has been used for agriculture over a long period
of time resulting in disturbances due to extensive terracing. In addition, disturbances due to oil
exploration activities and storage facilities, modern residential development, and associated road
construction at each terminus of this project have occurred. No archeological deposits or remains were
identified during the survey.
All materials (notes, photographs, administrative documents, and other project data) generated from
this work will be housed at the Center for Archeological Studies at San Marcos, where they will be made
permanently available to future researchers per 13 Texas Administrative Code 26.16-17.
If any unanticipated cultural materials or deposits are found at any stage of clearing, preparation, or
construction, the work should cease and Texas Historical Commission personnel should be notified
immediately.
The Texas Historical Commission concurred with the findings and recommendations of this report on April
12, 2018.

INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Parker County plans to construct the new William Ward Road measuring approximately 3500 linear
feet (ft), or 1066.8 meters (m), in eastern Springtown, Texas (Figure 1). The project begins at the
intersection of Knob Road and Summerfield Court and continues south/southeast approximately 0.66
miles (mi), or 1.06 kilometers (km), to Walnut Creek Drive. It is bordered to the north by residential
development, to the south by Walnut Creek, with pastureland, hayfields and oilfields in between. The
current project area consists of the entire footprint of the proposed William Ward Road, which is owned
by Parker County and covers approximately 8.9 acres (ac), or 3.6 hectares (ha). The new road will be
four lanes, undivided, crossing pasture, hayfields, oilfields, and residential development.
On April 4, 2018 Brett M. Lang (Project Archeologist) of Cox|McLain Environmental Consulting, Inc.
(CMEC) conducted an intensive archeological survey of the 8.9-ac (3.6-ha) new William Ward Road
location.

REGULATORY CONTEXT
Because the project area, located in eastern part of the City of Springtown, is owned by Parker County,
a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (9
Texas Natural Resources Code [TNRC] 191), which requires consideration of effects on properties
designated as—or eligible to be designated as—State Antiquity Landmarks (SALs), which includes
archeological resources. There is no known federal nexus for this project.

METHODOLOGICAL AND LOGISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
CMEC conducted an intensive survey per 13 TAC 26.15 and using the definitions in 13 TAC 26.5. Field
methods and strategies will comply with the requirements of 13 TAC 26.20, as elaborated by the THC
and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).
CMEC conducted a pedestrian inspection with shovel test excavations of the entire William Ward Road
project corridor following the CTA guidelines as approved by THC for 16 shovel tests per mile, or in
this case, a minimum of 8 shovel tests. More intensive shovel testing at closer intervals was anticipated
in the higher-potential sections along Walnut Creek at the southern end of the project corridor.

Close examination of the creek banks was also undertaken to determine if buried paleosols were
present and observable. Generally, shovel tests were placed in areas where ground surface visibility
was below 30 percent, soils appeared to be of sufficient depth and integrity to contain intact subsurface
cultural materials, historic maps indicated high potential for historic archaeological sites, and/or previous
disturbances appeared minimal.
Shovel tests were excavated in natural levels within Holocene sediments until obstructions, subsoil, or
100 centimeters (39.3 inches [in]; the approximate maximum reach for a standard shovel test), was
encountered. Excavated matrix was screened through 0.635-centimeter (cm; [0.25 in]) hardware cloth
as allowed by moisture and clay content, which would require that the removed sediment be
crumbled/sorted by hand, trowel, and/or shovel point. Deposits were described using conventional
texture classifications and Munsell color designations. All shovel tests were placed based on guidelines
established by the CTA and approved by the THC. All shovel test locations were selected based on
observed disturbance levels, and ground surface visibility.

STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 presents environmental parameters, a brief cultural context, and
a summary of previous archeological research near the APE. Chapter 3 discusses research goals,
relevant methods, and the underlying regulatory considerations. Chapter 4 presents the results of the
survey and analysis of historic resources. Chapter 5 offers recommendations, and references are in
Chapter 6.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT

TOPOGRAPHY, GEOLOGY, AND SOILS
The 8.9-ac (3.6-ha) project corridor is located approximately 812 to 840 ft (247 to 256 m) above
mean sea level in east Springtown, Parker County, Texas. The project begins at the intersection of Knob
Road and Summerfield Court and continues south/southeast approximately 0.66 mi (1.06 km) to Walnut
Creek Drive. It is bordered to the north by residential development, to the south by Walnut Creek, with
pastureland, hayfields, and oilfields in between. Geologically, the project area is underlain primarily
by the Cretaceous-age Paluxy Formation, with a small section of Holocene-age Alluvium adjacent to
Walnut Creek (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS] 2018). The Paluxy Formation is composed primarily of
fine to very fine-grained sandstone, mudstone, and limestone. Alluvium is composed of floodplain
deposits that include gravel, sand, silt, and silty clay (USGS 2018).
According to Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) data, the soils mapped in the project area
primarily fall within the Duffau-Windhorst complex on 1 to 5 percent slopes that are moderately
eroded. Smaller groupings of soils include the Selden loamy fine sand on 1 to 5 percent slopes, Bosque
loam with 0 to 1 percent slopes, and May fine sandy loam on 1 to 3 percent slopes. The soils collectively
are very deep, well to moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in sandy or loamy
materials, loamy alluvium, or sandy/clayey residuum of Cretaceous- or Pleistocene-age deposits. The
Pleistocene-age deposits are primarily located in the southern end of the project adjacent to Walnut
Creek. All of the soil types are mapped as having an A horizon underlain with a shallow B or E horizon
(Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2018).

VEGETATION, PHYSIOGRAPHY, AND LAND USE
The 8.9 ac project area falls in the Western Cross Timbers sub region of the Grand Prairie ecoregion
(Griffith et al. 2004). The Western Cross Timbers is characterized by transitional mosaic oak woodland
and prairies that lies between the eastern deciduous forest and the Great Plains on rolling plains
topography with extremely dense tree vegetation common. Vegetation within the project is dominated
by post oak and blackjack oak trees, along with shrub and grass understory. Trees in the Western Cross
Timbers often are stressed from drought causing old growth trees to be no taller than 20 to 30 ft (6 to
9 m) (Griffith et al. 2004).
According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s (TPWD) Vegetation Types of Texas map and
accompanying descriptions, the site is in an area mapped as Crops (McMahan et al. 1984). The project
area is currently predominately horse or cattle pasture land with dense vegetation along the northern
bank of Walnut Creek at the southern end. Based on field observations, the region is used primarily for
horse or cattle grazing. The slope and terraces make it likely that the horse and cattle grazing land
was once used for row crops. Average annual precipitation in this region is reported to be between 28
and 32 in; 71.1 and 81.3 cm) from 1981 to 2010 (Spatial Climate Analysis Service [SCAS] 2000).

GENERAL ARCHEOLOGICAL CHRONOLOGY FOR NORTH-CENTRAL
TEXAS
The APE lies within the western part of the north-central Texas archeological region (Perttula 2004). The
standard cultural chronology for the region has changed little in the last three decades; thus, the periods
and date ranges established by Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1990), and Yates and Ferring
(1986) still apply (Table 1). The general prehistoric framework for north-central Texas is similar to that
used in other areas of Texas, and indeed throughout much of North America, with the first unequivocal
human occupations occurring approximately 11,500 radiocarbon years before present (BP), or
approximately 13,000 calendar years ago, and most of the prehistoric record is contained within a
long Archaic period lasting nearly 8,000 years.

archeology (see Perttula 2004a:14, Note 1).

Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian occupation is the least known period in the prehistory of north-central Texas, due
primarily to three factors: the light population density of Paleoindian peoples, the great age of the
occupation (up to 13,000 calendar years), and taphonomic factors such as severe erosion and deep
sedimentation, depending on location (Ferring 1989, 2001; Holliday 2004). Although initially seen as
narrowly specialized big-game hunters, Paleoindian groups such as Clovis are being reevaluated in
light of recent discoveries such as the Aubrey site north of Dallas-Fort Worth. At Aubrey, investigators
found evidence of a more balanced, flexible subsistence strategy, with remains of big game such as
bison and mammoth, but also fish, birds, and other small game (Ferring 2001). Generally, Paleoindian
people are thought to have been more mobile than subsequent populations, utilizing lithic and other
resources from broad geographic areas.

William Ward Road Cultural Resources Investigations

Archaic Period
Usually divided into three more or less equal parts, the Archaic Period encompasses the bulk of northcentral Texas prehistory. The Archaic record is clouded by mixed deposits (Hofman et al. 1989; Prikryl
1990) and possible large-scale erosion in the middle of the period (as has been documented farther to
the west by Blum and colleagues [1992]). Still, the available data show that Archaic peoples were more
likely than their predecessors to make projectile points and other stone tools out of local raw materials,
potentially indicating more spatially restricted territories and/or subsistence areas, perhaps reflecting
seasonal rounds through a specific series of resource-gathering zones (Ferring and Yates 1997; Peter
and McGregor 1988). Generally, population is thought to have increased throughout the Archaic Period,
perhaps in response to stabilizing climatic conditions.
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric Period is defined technologically with the beginning of the period typically marked
by the appearance of arrow points and ceramics. Aside from the addition of these extremely important
technologies, the overall trajectory of subsistence lifeways in the Late Prehistoric is usually thought to
represent a continuation of trends seen in the later part of the Archaic, with even more dramatic focus
on very local resources and broad-spectrum foraging (Ferring and Yates 1997). In the latter part of
the period (Late Prehistoric II), the picture shifts, with ceramic and lithic evidence indicating links to Plains
populations to the north and west (Prikryl 1990).
Protohistoric and Historic Period
The beginning of the Protohistoric Period is marked by the first appearance of Europeans in Texas: the
Spanish explorers, priests, and speculators who began moving into the state from colonies to the south
and west in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Although technically historic (i.e., characterized by
the use of writing), this earlier phase is often separated from the more-formally designated Historic
Period due to the relative infrequency of direct Spanish incursions into north-central Texas, in contrast
to the high-profile, early Spanish occupations in south and south-central Texas (Campbell 2003). Even
without the missions, military outposts, and other facilities characteristic of the Spanish presence to the
south, the effects of trade, disease, and other factors on native populations were still dramatic, and
indigenous groups of the Protohistoric Period are little known apart from sporadic finds of European
trade goods at native sites (Stephenson 1970).
The last two centuries are considered the Historic Period. In brief, the landscape and material culture of
north-central Texas during this time are characterized by the overwhelming dominance of Europeanderived populations and the expansion of railroads, the discovery and exploitation of petroleum
resources, the supplanting of small tenant farming by mechanized agriculture and urban sprawl, and
various waves of commercial and industrial development, the most recent example being the rise of the
service and information economies (Campbell 2003).

Parker County was named after Isaac Parker who along with 224 settlers requested the formation of
a new county. The county was founded in December of 1855 from parts of Bosque and Navarro counties
with Weatherford named as the county seat. Immigration into the new county was greatly assisted by
the spread of malaria in Tarrant, Denton, and Collin counties, along with introduction of the Butterfield
Overland Mail route in 1855. By 1858 a two-story brick courthouse was built in Weatherford, and the
first flour mill appeared in 1859. By December of 1860 the census reported 4,213 people (including
222 slaves) living on 397 farms and ranches, as well as 14,000 cattle and 4,000 sheep reported
(Echeverria 2010).
The Civil War greatly disrupted the county’s economy and society. The population dropped due to
many of the young men enlisting into the Confederate Army’s Parsons’s Brigade. The brigade was
comprised of nine companies each with 80 men (Echeverria 2010). The number of rural farms and
ranches decreased as civilians moved to the county seat for safety from Indian raids. By the end of the
war, many of the farms and ranches were in disrepair and livestock scattered throughout the county.
Continual Indian raids in the 1860s and 1870s also kept the population down. The last recorded Indian
raid was in 1874 helping to stabilize the economy and allowed the population to once again increase.
By 1880 the population increased to 15,870 with 1865 operating farms and ranches (Echeverria 2010).
The economy of Parker County was largely based on agriculture and expanded with the arrival of the
railroad. Cotton became the primary crop from the 1880s to around 1910. Additionally, in 1880 corn
and wheat were grown on 27,000 acres across the county. The arrival of the Texas and Pacific Railway
in 1879, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe in 1887, and lastly, the Weatherford, Mineral Wells, and
Northwestern in 1891 increased both the population and the number of farms and ranches. Cities that
still exist today, such as Aledo, Annetta, Garner, and Springtown, were formed by 1890 due to the
railroads. Cotton production increased steadily with nearly 90,000 ac employed by 1900. Fruit trees
became numerous by 1910 with 144,000 planted, with peach trees the most common. However, 1910
also saw the sharp cotton reduction that extended into the 1920s, along with a steady decline in
population (Echeverria 2010).
The Great Depression marked a shift from largely cotton production to diverse agricultural and dairy
farms and, eventually, oil production. The unemployment rate in Parker County rose from 4 to 15.7
percent due to the Great Depressionand a steep drop in cotton production. The population rose slightly
by 1940, up to 20,482, because of Civilian Conservation Corps programs in 1935 and 1936 that gave
jobs to young men to terrace agricultural fields. After World War II Parker County became the State’s
leading producer of peanuts, hay, fruits (other than citrus), vegetables, and livestock by 1960. The
construction of Interstate Highway 20 in the 1960s introduced large scale oil production by 1973. At
the same time as the oil industry took hold, the dairy industry continued to advance with 165 Grade A
dairies by 1965 (Echeverria 2010).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED
RESOURCES
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas), maintained by the THC and the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, was conducted in order to identify archeological sites, historical
markers (Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks), properties or districts listed in the NRHP, SALs, cemeteries,
and previously conducted cultural resource investigations in the project area and within a one-mile
buffer (the standard buffer zone for such searches) surrounding it (Figure 2). The survey information
available on the Atlas is, however, somewhat limited to investigations conducted primarily under the
Antiquities Code of Texas and may not include all projects (i.e., projects conducted under Section 106
only) previously conducted in the area.
According to the Atlas, the project area has not been previously surveyed (THC 2018). There are two
previous cultural resources studies conducted within one mile of the project area. A project area
surveyed by AR Consultants in 2003 approximately 0.8 mi (1.3 km) west of the current project examined
the location of a proposed park along Walnut Creek. No cultural material was observed during the
survey and a majority of the park project area had been previously disturbed. A second, and closer,
survey from 1977, sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agencyis shown extending along Walnut
Creek immediately adjacent to the south end of the current project. No further information was available
for the survey. Finally, in 1987 the SH 199 alignment was surveyed on behalf of the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) and Federal Highway Administration (THC 2018). No sites were recorded
for any of the previous surveys.
A review of available historic aerials and topographic maps on the Nationwide Environmental Title
Research (NETR) online was undertaken to assess how the APE has been utilized over time. The earliest
aerial photograph available for the area, produced in 1968, clearly indicates the presence of
agricultural terracing in the northern part of the project area and at the southern end at Walnut Creek
Drive and pasture land in between (NETR 2018). Aerial photographs from 1995 through 2017 show
that the area has changed little, with the exception of residential development along Knob Road and
Summerfield Court where the terracing was previously observed. Aerial photographs from 2008
through 2017 also show oilfield or mining activity immediately northwest of Walnut Creek Drive (NETR
2018).
The earliest historical topographic map dates from 1932 and does not indicate development of any
kind or any of the current roads. The later topographic maps from 1960, 1974, 1979, and 1992
indicate only Walnut Creek Road within the project area. Additionally, no structures are mapped in any
of the topographic maps (NETR 2018).

RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH
The present study was carried out to accomplish two major goals, strictly as a due diligence exercise:
1. Identify all historic and prehistoric archeological resources located within the APE defined in
Chapter 1.
2. Make recommendations for further research concerning any identified resources based on the
NRHP/SAL evaluation criteria and guidance on methodology and ethics from the THC and the
CTA.

THE ANTIQUITIES CODE OF TEXAS
Because the project is currently owned by Parker County , a political subdivision of the State of Texas,
the project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (9 TNRC 191), which requires consideration of
effects on properties designated as—or eligible to be designated as—SALs, which are defined as:
. . . sites, objects, buildings, structures and historic shipwrecks, and locations of historical,
archeological, educational, or scientific interest including, but not limited to, prehistoric American
Indian or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, aboriginal paintings,
petroglyphs, and other marks or carvings on rock or elsewhere which pertain to early American
Indian or other archeological sites of every character, treasure imbedded in the earth, sunken
or abandoned ships and wrecks of the sea or any part of their contents, maps, records,
documents, books, artifacts, and implements of culture in any way related to the inhabitants,
prehistory, history, government, or culture in, on, or under any of the lands of the State of Texas,
including the tidelands, submerged land, and the bed of the sea within the jurisdiction of the
State of Texas (13 TAC 26.2).
Rules of practice and procedure for the evaluation of cultural resources as SALs, which is explicitly
referenced at the state level, are detailed in 13 TAC 26. An archeological site identified on lands
owned or controlled by the State of Texas may be of sufficient significance to allow designation as a
SAL if at least one of the following criteria applies:
1.

the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history
of Texas by the addition of new and important information;

2.

the site's archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;

3.

the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;

4.

the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby
contributing to new scientific knowledge; or

5.

the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and official
landmark designation is needed to insure [sic] maximum legal protection, or alternatively further
10

William Ward Road Cultural Resources Investigations

investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site
cannot be protected (13 TAC 26.10).
For archeological resources, the state-level process requires securing and maintaining a valid Texas
Antiquities Permit from the THC, the lead state agency for Antiquities Code compliance. This permit must
be maintained throughout all stages of investigation, analysis, and reporting.
Buildings, structures, cultural landscapes, and non-archeological sites, objects, and districts may also be
designated as SALs, provided that the following conditions are met:
1. The property fits within at least one of the following criteria:
(A)

the property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic group;

(B)

the property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;

(C)

the property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or represents
a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction;

(D)

the property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas culture
or history;

2. The property retains integrity at the time of the nomination, as determined by the executive
director of the commission; and
3. For buildings and structures only, the property must be listed in the NRHP, either individually, or
as a contributing property within a historic district. Contributing status may be determined by
the Keeper of the National Register or the executive director of the commission.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODS AND PROTOCOLS
With the goals and guidelines above in mind, CMEC personnel conducted an intensive survey by walking
over the entire new Williams Ward Road location on April 4, 2018, per category 6 under 13 TAC
26.15 and using the definitions in 13 TAC 26.3, searching for previously identified and unidentified
archeological sites. Field methods complied with the coverage requirements of 13 TAC 26.15, as
expounded on by the THC and CTA.
Shovel tests were placed approximately every 100 m within the project area along the new road
location. Shovel tests were placed in areas where ground surface visibility was below 30 percent, soils
appeared to be of sufficient depth to potentially contain subsurface cultural materials, and/or previous
disturbance appeared minimal. All shovel tests were excavated in natural levels to subsoil or 50 cm
(19.6 in), whichever was encountered first. Excavated matrix was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in)
hardware cloth. Deposits were described using conventional texture classifications and Munsell color
designations. Fieldwork did not require any deviations from THC and CTA standards.

11

William Ward Road Cultural Resources Investigations

Based upon all available information, the majority of the project area appears to hold low probability
for surficial and/or buried cultural resources (e.g., lack of topographic high points, poorly drained soils,
modern disturbance). The area with the highest archeological potential is located along Walnut Creek
in the southern portion of the project, where the Pleistocene-age Alluvium deposits are mapped. No
archeological sites have been recorded along Walnut Creek, but close cutbank examination and shovel
testing is recommended.
Project materials such as shovel test forms, photographs, photograph logs, and GPS data will be
permanently curated and made available to future researchers at the Center for Archeological Studies
(CAS) per 13 TAC 26.16 and 26.17.

ARCHEOLOGICAL RESULTS

GENERAL FIELD OBSERVATIONS
On April 4, 2018, CMEC personnel conducted an intensive survey of the 8.9-ac (3.6-ha) project corridor
with the shovel test locations shown on Figure 3. The north end of the project corridor is located on a
hilltop area south of Summerfield Court in a manicured, mowed and terraced yard of a residence. The
remainder of the proposed road location slightly slopes down to Walnut Creek crossing horse and cattle
grazing pastures and hay field, and oilfields.
The survey was conducted north to the south starting at Summerfield Court. The north end of the project
is on a hilltop area with the highest topographic elevation at approximately 840 ft amsl. The setting
was a mowed, terraced yard east of a mobile home situated on top of the hill (Figures 4 and 5). The
ground visibility ranged from 0 to 20 percent with short prairie grasses and young growth trees
primarily located along fence lines to the east and south, and one large oak tree in the yard. Shovel
tests WW01 and WW02 (see Figure 3) were excavated within the terraced, mowed yard; both were
negative for cultural material. The shovel tests consisted of shallow sandy loam extending to 15 or 30
cm below surface (cmbs) underlain with mottled sandy clay. A complete description of all the shovel
tests is located in Table 2.
South of this residential parcel, the corridor continues into horse and cow pastures, with more horses
observed than cows. The slope of the ground surface is minimal, and evidence of terracing was not
present (Figure 6). The ground visibility ranged from 0 to 20 percent with short ankle-high prairie
grasses only. Shovel tests WW03 to WW09 were excavated exhibiting shallow sandy loam extending
to approximately 30 cmbs underlain with mottled sandy clay to 40 cmbs as the most common soil profile.
The exceptions were ST WW03, which did not encounter mottled sandy clay until 80 cmbs, and ST
WW06 with solid clay encountered at 20 cmbs. A typical shovel test profile, WW05, is shown in Figure
7. The location of shovel tests WW08 and WW09 lie in a more disturbed, terraced, and less used
horse/cow pasture with scattered taller waist-high prairie grasses and increased ground visibility up to
40 percent. None of the shovel tests were positive for cultural material on the surface or subsurface in
these pastures.
The field immediately north of Walnut Creek Drive at the south end of the project corridor was disturbed
by oilfield activities. Ground visibility ranged from 10 to 40 percent in the nearly level setting with
either short ankle-high or waist-high prairie grasses present. In addition, more disturbance of the project
corridor is evident with a well pad to the west of the corridor (Figure 8). Shovel tests WW10 and
WW11 were excavated with sandy clay either on the surface or shallow at 20 cmbs and no cultural
material observed.

The north bank of Walnut Creek was located immediately south of the southern end of the overall
project corridor. Inside the corridor, shovel test WW12 was excavated in a narrow densely vegetated
area between Walnut Creek Drive and the creek (Figure 9). The results demonstrated sandy loam to
50 plus cmbs before excessive roots justified termination with no cultural material observed.
Additionally, disturbance from road construction and metal pole tie downs at the ground were detected.
While outside of the overall project corridor, the north and south banks of Walnut Creek were examined
for any buried paleosols or cultural material in the soil profiles. The view from the bridge (Figure 10)
shows the dimensions of the creek at approximately 20 to 30 m (65.6 to 98.4 ft) wide and 7 to 8 m
(22.9 to 26.2 ft) deep. The north bank of the creek (Figure 11) shows the deep homogenous layer of
sandy loam extending from the surface to, at, or near the current water level. No gravel layers were
observed on the north bank profile. The south bank exhibited the same homogenous sandy loam layer,
except that a gravel layer composed of golf ball to softball-sized material was observed
approximately half-way down the soil profile. No cultural remains or paleosols were evident in the soil
profile of the south bank.

RECOMMENDATIONS

In April 2018, intensive archeological survey with shovel testing was conducted along the proposed
0.66-mile William Ward Road. Based on the results of the survey, it is recommended that Parker County
should be allowed to proceed with the construction of the new east of Springtown. The recommendation
is due to the evidence of numerous disturbances from agricultural terracing, oilfield activities, horse and
cattle grazing, residential development, and previous associated road construction in the project
corridor. No cultural material was observed in any of the shovel tests or on the surface. If any
unanticipated cultural materials or deposits are found at any stage of clearing, preparation, or
construction, the work should cease and THC personnel should be immediately notified.
No artifacts were collected during the survey. However, all notes, photographs, administrative
documents, and other pertinent project data generated from this investigation will be housed at CAS,
where they will be made permanently available to future researchers per 13 TAC 26.16-17.
