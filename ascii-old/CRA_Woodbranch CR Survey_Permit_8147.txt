MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Cultural Resource Analysts, Inc., personnel completed a records review and cultural resource survey
of 2.2 ha (5.4 acres) of land associated with the expansion of the water plant at 47B Woodbranch within
the City of Woodbranch Village, Montgomery County, Texas. The cultural resource survey was conducted
at the request of O’Malley Strand Associates, Inc., on behalf of the City of Woodbranch Village, Texas, in
support of the water system expansion effort currently underway. This was a Texas Water Development
Board project with funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, and therefore subject to Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, with regulatory oversight provided by the Texas Historical
Commission under the Antiquities Code of Texas. Because the project area is owned by the City of
Woodbranch Village, a subdivision of the State of Texas, a Texas Antiquities Permit was required for the
completion of the work presented in this report (Permit No. 8147). This management summary outlines the
results of the file search and fieldwork and also provides recommendations regarding cultural resource
management for the proposed project.
The Phase I cultural resources investigation completed for this project included a records review and
an intensive archaeological survey, the fieldwork for which occurred on September 18, 2017. The records
review was conducted in two hours and the fieldwork took a total of five hours to complete. Jeremy W.
Pye, Ph.D., RPA 28577494, served as Principal Investigator and also conducted the fieldwork. The purpose
of the survey was to locate, describe, evaluate, and make appropriate recommendations for the future
treatment of any historic or prehistoric archeological properties that may have been threatened by the
proposed water plant expansion project.
The records review for the project utilized online files on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission, to identify cultural resources or cultural resource
investigations previously documented within the vicinity of the project area. In addition, historical
quadrangle and soil maps obtained from the United States Geological Survey as well as the United States
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service were reviewed for the presence of
historically mapped structures within the project area. The records review indicated that no previous
archaeological surveys overlap the current project area, and no previously recorded archaeological or
historic resources are documented within the 1.6 km (1.0 mi) file search buffer of the project area.
The field methodology consisted of intensive pedestrian survey supplemented by screened shovel tests.
Surface visibility varied within the project area, and when sufficient, was utilized for surface inspection to
detect any artifacts or cultural soil horizons that had become exposed. Pedestrian survey transects were
spaced at 30 m (98 ft) intervals across the project area according to Texas Historical Commission
specifications. Shovel tests were excavated in areas of low slope and that also have limited surface visibility
(< 30 percent) due to vegetation or other ground cover. Areas of fair to high ground surface visibility (>30
percent) were investigated via pedestrian survey only. All shovel tests and pedestrian transects were
negative for cultural materials.
The fieldwork resulted in negative findings. No archaeological materials or architectural resources
older than 50 years were identified during the current fieldwork. Based on the records review and the
negative findings from the archaeological fieldwork, a No Historic Properties Affected determination is
recommended for the project area. This work was completed in less than one week; and therefore, the report
follows the short report content prescribed in the Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management Reports
published by the Council of Texas Archeologists.

(Permit No. 8147). All work associated with this
investigation was conducted pursuant to
standards set forth by the State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO) to comply with the
NHPA of 1966, as amended, and specifically the
regulations for implementing Section 106 of the
Act (36 CFR 800).

ultural Resource Analysts, Inc., personnel
completed a records review and cultural
resource survey of a 2.2 ha (5.4 acre) area of land
associated with the expansion of the existing
water plant at 47B Woodbranch, City of
Woodbranch Village, Montgomery County,
Texas (Figure 1). This cultural resource survey
was conducted at the request of O’Malley Strand
Associates, Inc, on behalf of the City of
Woodbranch Village, Texas.

Project Personnel
and Time Spent
Jeremy W. Pye, Ph.D., RPA 989943, served
as principal investigator and conducted the field
investigations for the project, which took a total
of 5 person hours to complete. Pye also conducted
the archeological file search, using online files on
the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas maintained
by the THC, which took approximately two hours
to complete. Pye authored the draft of this report
of findings. The final report production was
completed by the CRA CAD and publications
departments. All field notes collected during the
survey will be curated with the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) of
the University of Texas at Austin.

Project Description
The project area consisted of a 2.2 ha (5.4
acre) area on the southern corner of the
intersection of Woodbranch Drive and Magnolia
Road in the City of Woodbranch Village, Texas.
Magnolia Drive formed the western boundary of
the project area, while Woodbranch Drive formed
the northern boundary. The existing water plant
sat within a fenced enclosure in the southeastern
portion of the project area. Private property
formed the southern boundary of the project area.
The boundary of the project area is depicted in
Figure 2 on the 1979 Splendora, Texas, 7.5minute quadrangle map.

Purpose of Study
The purpose of this assessment was to locate,
describe, evaluate, and to make appropriate
recommendations for the future treatment of any
historic or prehistoric archeological properties
that may be affected by the proposed activities.
The cultural resource survey was ordered in
support of water system expansion within the
City of Woodbranch Village. This is a Texas
Water Development Board project with federal
funding from the Environmental Protection
Agency, and is therefore subject to Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA),
with regulatory oversight by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) under the Antiquities Code
of Texas. Because the project area is owned by
the City of Woodbranch Village, and
municipalities
are
considered
political
subdivisions of the State of Texas, a Texas
Antiquities Permit was required for the
completion of the work presented in this report

Summary of Findings

plant in the northeastern portion of the property
(Figure 3), while the majority of the property to
the northwest of the water plant was wooded and
consisted of young hardwood trees with a low to
medium density underbrush (Figure 4). A manmade drainage channel ran along the southern
side of Woodbranch Drive from its intersection
with Magnolia Road before merging with a
natural erosion channel forming along the
northwestern fence line of the water plant
enclosure (Figure 5). The portion of the project
area to the south of the water plant enclosure and
also the wooded area was largely covered with
short grasses, weeds, and scattered trees. A
mobile home and several small modern
outbuildings lay within this southern portion of
the property, while two structures, a water tower,
and other equipment lay within the water plant
enclosure, but none of these structures appeared
to be 50 years of age or older.

As part of the project, a records review was
conducted using online files available from the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by
the THC to identify cultural resources or cultural
resource investigations previously documented
within the vicinity of the project area. No
previously documented archaeological sites or
historical architectural resources were located
within the project area or within the 1.6 km (1.0
mi) records review buffer. According to data
presented on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
no previous cultural resource projects have been
conducted within the project area presented in
this report.
The project area was vegetated with short,
manicured grasses and scattered large trees
within the fenced enclosure of the existing water

II. RESEARCH DESIGN
AND FIELD METHODS

The field methodology consisted of an
intensive pedestrian survey supplemented by
screened shovel tests. Surface visibility varied
within the project area, and when sufficient was
utilized for surface inspection to detect any
artifacts or cultural soil horizons that had become
exposed. Pedestrian survey transects, of which
there were six, were spaced at 30 m (98 ft)
intervals across the project area according to
THC specifications (Figure 6). Shovel tests were
excavated in areas of low slope and also those
areas with limited surface visibility due to
vegetation or other ground cover. All shovel tests
and pedestrian transects were negative for
cultural materials.

F

ield investigations consisted of an intensive
pedestrian survey utilizing surface visibility,
supplemented with the excavation of screened
shovel tests. Surface visibility varied within the
project area, and when sufficient was utilized for
surface inspection to detect any artifacts or
cultural soil horizons that had become exposed.
Pedestrian survey transects were spaced at 30 m
(98 ft) intervals across the project area according
to THC specifications. Shovel tests were
excavated in areas of low slope and that also have
limited surface visibility (< 30 percent) due to
vegetation or other ground cover. Areas of fair to
high ground surface visibility (>30 percent) were
investigated via pedestrian survey only.

The fieldwork resulted in negative findings.
No archaeological materials or evidence of
architectural resources older than 50 years were
identified during the current fieldwork. Based on
the records review and the negative findings from
the archaeological fieldwork, a No Historic

Affected
determination
is
recommended for the project area.

All shovel tests measured 30-x-30 cm (12-x12 in) in diameter and were excavated until sterile
subsoil was encountered or to a minimum of 50
cm (20 in) below ground surface. In areas where
subsoil was not encountered, excavations often
continued to as much as 80 cm (31 in) below the
ground surface. All fill removed from the tests
was screened through .64 cm (.25 in) mesh
hardware cloth, exposed profiles in each shovel
test were recorded on standardized recording
forms, and the sidewalls and bottoms of the
shovel tests were examined for artifacts, potential
cultural soil horizons, and features.

Report Organization
This report is intended to follow the
suggested format for a Short Report, as presented
in the Council of Texas Archeologists Guidelines
for Cultural Resource Management Reports. It is
organized into five numbered sections. Section I
provides an overview of the project and
summarizes the results of the archeological
investigation. Section
II
explains
the
methodological approach employed in the
cultural resources survey, while Section III
details the results of the records review. Section
IV elaborates on the results of the archeological
investigation and includes a discussion of the
depositional context of the project area. Report
summary and recommendations regarding future
work in the project area are presented in Section
V. Résumés for key personnel are included as an
appendix to this report.

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinates for all beginning and end points of
survey transects were recorded as point files
using ESRI ArcPad 11 software on a
GeoExplorer 3000 Series GeoXT handheld
global positioning system (GPS) unit
manufactured by Trimble to verify locations
within the project area with greater than ± 3 m (10
ft) accuracy. Data was collected using the North
American Datum (NAD) 1983 projection.
Typically as many as 5 to 7 satellites were being
tracked at any given time.

III. RECORDS REVIEW

Magnolia Drive had been constructed, but still no
structures were mapped within, or immediately
adjacent to the project area.

T

he records review for this project consisted of
a search of the online files on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, maintained by the
THC to identify cultural resources or cultural
resource investigations previously documented
within the project area. Additionally, the files
search included all previously recorded
archaeological and historic resources within a 1.6
km (1.0 mi) buffer of the project area to gain a
perspective on the type of resources that are
present in the immediate vicinity of the project
area.

IV. RESULTS

O

n September 18, 2017, the current project
area was systematically investigated by a
combination of intensive pedestrian survey and
shovel tests excavated in intervals of 30 m (98 ft)
in undisturbed areas with low ground surface
visibility. The pedestrian survey involved the
visual examination of the landscape for above
ground features or artifacts older than 50 years of
age. The project area overall had low surface
visibility at the time of the survey due to
vegetation, although some areas of bare ground
were present within the fenced water plant
enclosure, along the sides of the roadways, and in
the banks of the drainage channel.

According to data presented on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, no previous cultural
resource projects have been conducted within the
project area investigated under the current work.
In
addition,
no
previously
recorded
archaeological sites or historical resources were
documented within the project area, or within the
1.6 km (1.0 mi) file search buffer.

A total of six survey transects were traversed
in a north-northeast – south-southwestern
orientation. Along those six transects, 21 shovel
tests locations were investigated. Excavations
could not take place in two of those locations due
to the presence of standing water or other
obstructions. All shovel tests were negative for
cultural materials.

Available historic maps of the Woodbranch
Village area were also reviewed to supplement
the records review. These included the 1953,
1957, 1978, and 1984 Beaumont, Texas, 1-x-2
degree topographic quadrangle maps (USGS
1953, 1957, 1978, 1984), the 1985 Conroe,
Texas, 30-x-60 minute topographic quadrangle
map (USGS 1985), as well as the 1959 and 1979
Splendora, Texas, 7.5 minute topographic
quadrangle maps (USGS 1959, 1979), all of
which are available from the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) through the USGS
Historic Topographic Map Explorer. No historic
soil maps of the area could be located in online
resources. Similarly, no Texas General Land
Office (TxGLO) maps for the area were available
for review.

Two mapped soil units were present in the
project area: Landman fine sand (Ab) and
Atasco-Urban land complex, 2 to 5 percent slopes
(AtuC) (USDA 2017). The Landman soils were
mapped largely in the eastern two-thirds of the
project area, while the Atasco soils were mapped
in the western one-third of the project area. Both
soil units are moderately well drained, alluvial
soils occupying the rises or treads of stream
terraces (USDA 2017).
The profiles of the excavated shovel tests in
undisturbed contexts within the project area
typically corresponded to one of the two soil
types described above. Shovel Test 6-4, in the
western portion of the project area was
representative of Atasco series soils, and
consisted of pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam
from 0 to 14.0 cm (0 to 5.5 in) below ground
surface (bgs), light brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy
loam with some oxidation from 14.0 to 40.0 cm
(5.5 to 15.7 in) bgs, and brownish yellow (10YR

Of the maps mentioned above, only the 1959
and 1979 Splendora 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle maps (USGS 1959, 1979) were drawn
at a scale to be of much use in determining
whether any historic structures or other features
might be present within the project area. The
1959 map indicated that Woodbranch Drive had
been constructed prior to that date, but no
structures were present within, or in the
immediate vicinity of the project area. By 1979,

resources are documented within the 1.6 km (1.0
mi) file search buffer of the project area.

6/6) mottled sandy clay with high oxidation
between 40 and 50 cm (15.7 and 19.8 in) at which
depth the excavations were terminated. Shovel
test 1-2 in the eastern portion of the project area
was representative of the Landman series soils
mapped in the vicinity of the project area and
consisted of dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)
sandy loam with slight mottling and some
oxidation from 0 to 13.0 cm (0 to 5.1 in) bgs
underlain by light brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy
loam with some oxidation and sparse ferrous
concretions from 13 to 80 cm (5.1 to 31.5 in), at
which depth the excavations were terminated.

The field methodology consisted of intensive
pedestrian survey supplemented by screened
shovel tests. The fieldwork resulted in negative
findings. No archaeological materials or
architectural resources older than 50 years were
identified during the current fieldwork. Based on
the records review and the negative findings from
the archaeological fieldwork, a No Historic
Properties
Affected
determination
is
recommended for the project area. If any
previously unrecorded archeological materials
are encountered during construction activity, the
THC should be notified immediately. If human
skeletal material is discovered, the construction
activities should cease, THC and local law
enforcement should be contacted immediately,
and THC guidelines should be followed.
