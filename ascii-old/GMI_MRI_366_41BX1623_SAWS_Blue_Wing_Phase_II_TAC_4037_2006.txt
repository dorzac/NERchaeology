ABSTRACT

Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), conducted Phase II archeological investigations at site 41BX1623 in
February 2006. This site is situated within a proposed pipeline corridor for San Antonio Water
System (SAWS) in southern Bexar County, Texas (GMI project #20275.02.08). SAWS proposes
to construct a sewer line that will connect the Blue Wing Lake holding facilities with the Dos
Rios/Salado interconnect pipeline. In addition to confirming two previously identified cultural
components, this investigation identified the potential for one additional component. The time
periods represented by these components include the early Late Prehistoric period and the later
portion of the Late Prehistoric period. The presence of cultural features, datable organic remains,
preservation of faunal remains, and diagnostic tool types indicates that this site retains research
potential and, therefore, is recommended eligible for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). This report presents the results of the assessment of the potential impact
that the pipeline will have on site 41BX1623 and the evaluation of this site’s eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP.
Collected artifacts—other than FCR—photographs, and notes concerning this project will be
permanently curated at the Center for Archaeological Research, University of Texas at San
Antonio. The FCR was counted and weighed before it was discarded.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

In February 2006, Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), conducted Phase II archeological investigations at
site 41BX1623, which is situated within a proposed pipeline corridor for San Antonio Water
System (SAWS) in southern Bexar County, Texas (GMI project #20275.02.08). SAWS proposes
to construct a sewer line that will connect the Blue Wing Lake holding facilities with the Dos
Rios/Salado interconnect pipeline. In compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas, SAWS
contracted with GMI to conduct archeological investigations of this site within the proposed
pipeline corridor under Antiquities Permit Number 4037. This report presents the results of the
assessment of the potential impact that the pipeline will have on site 41BX1623 and the
evaluation of this site’s eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP).
Site 41BX1623 lies west of the San Antonio River on a primary terrace overlooking the river. It
is located approximately 2.1 miles (3.4 kilometers) northwest of the confluence of the San
Antonio and Medina rivers. The site area encompasses the level terrace and adjacent slope
toward the San Antonio River. The western portion of site 41BX1623 is within an agricultural
field on the level terrace tread. The site extends from there to the east beyond the tree line and
toward the terrace slope as it descends toward an unnamed tributary of the San Antonio River.
The site is located on the Southton, 1992 USGS 7.5' topographic quadrangle near Blue Wing
Lake.
Site 41BX1623 was originally identified in July 2005 when GMI conducted an intensive
pedestrian archeological survey of the pipeline corridor under Antiquities Permit Number 3818
for SAWS. During this investigation, GMI personnel discovered the site near the eastern
termination of the pipeline (Tiné and Kuehn 2005) (Figure 1). Through surface inspection of an
agricultural field on the terrace above the pipeline termination and backhoe trenching designed to
investigate this terrace and the westward slope, this site was considered potentially eligible for
NRHP inclusion.
This site was originally identified and recorded as containing two stratified components. The two
prehistoric components were recognized in two backhoe trenches at the eastern end of the site
beyond the plowed field. As a result of the discovery of site 41BX1623, SAWS altered the
proposed alignment for the pipeline corridor by shifting it northward, though not outside the site

investigated the new corridor to determine if construction in the revised alignment would
negatively impact significant cultural resources at site 41BX1623. This investigation also served
as an NRHP eligibility evaluation for the site.
The present archeological investigations at site 41BX1623 involved the excavation of six backhoe
trenches and six hand-excavated test units placed adjacent to three of the trenches. The
geoarcheological component of the research focused on the stratigraphic interpretation of the
backhoe trenches. This report presents the results of these investigations and supports the
recommendation that this site should be considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

PHYSIOGRAPHIC AND GEOLOGIC SETTING
Site 41BX1623 is located to the southeast of the Balcones Escarpment, which is a broad area of
hills and faulted limestone that marks the boundary between the Edwards Plateau to the
north/northwest and the Gulf Coastal Plains to the south/southeast (Bureau of Economic Geology
1996; Tiné and Kuehn 2005:4) (Figure 3). The Balcones Escarpment forming the southern and
eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau primarily governs the regional physiography. The
escarpment rises approximately 1,000 feet (ft) above the coastal prairie that lies to the south and
east and has a marked influence on the environmental setting. It extends from near Del Rio,
Texas, about 160 miles to the west, through northern Bexar County, to Austin (70 miles to the
northeast). Remnants of the escarpment extend as far north as Waco. This physical feature runs
northeast to southwest through the San Antonio area. The Gulf Coastal Plains cover a large
portion of the southern United States and are composed of flat to seaward-dipping beds of
Cretaceous through Quaternary chalks, limestones, sands, and muds (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1996; Walker and Coleman 1987). Coastal plains geologic units in the San Antonio area
include the Cretaceous Navarro and Taylor Groups, the Paleocene Wilcox and Midway Groups,
and large deposits of Quaternary-aged sediments (Bureau of Economic Geology 1992).
The Edwards Plateau is a dissected upland region formed in marine deposits of sandstone,
limestone, shale, and dolomite (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). The Edwards Plateau is
considered a prominent feature of the Southern Great Plains (Fenneman 1931). It is a rugged
hilly region dissected by many small streams. Within the San Antonio region, the Edwards
Plateau is drained by the Medina, Cibolo and Balcones creeks and contains the headwaters of
Culebra, Leon, and Salado creeks (Taylor et al. 1991:119). These rivers converge into the San
Antonio River valley in Bexar County below the Balcones Escarpment. Plateau elevations range
from 1,100 feet to 1,900 feet. Fenneman (1931) mapped the Edwards Plateau as part of the Great
Plains Province.
As summarized in Tiné and Kuehn (2005:4–5), the Blue Wing project is located in southern
Bexar County along the western side of the San Antonio River valley. Geomorphic landforms in
this area include the active channel and meandering floodplain of the San Antonio River,
abandoned channels and oxbow lakes, a number of San Antonio River terraces, and dissected

uplands. The San Antonio River joins the Medina River approximately 2.1 miles (3.4 km)
southeast of the project area. Having more or less the same base-level in the general project area,
both rivers are likely to have similar terrace networks. These are illustrated in the project area,
where two distinct terraces were observed above the San Antonio River. The oldest is a probable
late Pleistocene/Holocene terrace eroded into the form of a small finger ridge in the southern
portion of the survey area (see Figure 1). The tread of the terrace lies roughly 15–20 meters (m;
49.2–65.6 ft) above the modern channel of the San Antonio River. This terrace is the geomorphic
analogue of the Applewhite terrace of the Medina River, as identified by Thoms (2001), Thoms
and Mandel (2005), and Thoms et al. (1997). The second terrace lies approximately 6.0 m
(19.7 ft) above the San Antonio River and is extant at the extreme southern end of the survey
tract. This terrace is analogous to the Miller terrace (late Holocene) of the Medina River (Thoms
and Mandel 2005, Thoms et al. 1997).
Soils within the project area primarily consist of Venus clay loam, 0 to1 percent slopes, although
Trinity and Frio soils, frequently flooded, and Hilly gravelly land occur along small portions of
the project area (Taylor et al. 1991).
Hilly gravelly land occurs as knolls and narrow ridges, and these are thought to be erosionresistant remnants of old waterways. Slopes range between 5 and 25 percent. The land type also
consists of outcrops of calcareous sandstone. It consists of beds of caliche or gravelly, very
strongly calcareous alluvium at least 3–6 m (10–20 ft) thick and overlain in nearly level areas by
a mantle of limy dark grayish brown loam, clay loam, or sandy loam varying in thickness from
10.2 centimeters (cm) to 20.3 cm (4–8 inches [in]) (Taylor et al. 1991:17).
Trinity and Frio soils, frequently flooded, are deep, clayey soils that occur on flood plains of
small streams and larger field drainages (Taylor et al. 1991:32). They develop from recent
alluvial sediments transported from nearby slopes (Taylor et al. 1991:109, 116). The typical soil
profile of Frio soils consists of a 50.8-cm (20-in) grayish brown (10YR 5/2), calcareous clay loam
A11 horizon, underlain by a 2-cm (5-inch) light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), calcareous clay loam
A12 horizon. The upper 3.9 cm (10 in) of the C horizon are pale brown (10YR 6/3) strongly
calcareous clay loam, and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) strongly calcareous loam composes the
lowest subsoil layer (Taylor et al. 1991:109). Trinity soils usually consist of a 127-cm (50-in)
A11 horizon of calcareous, dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay above an A12 horizon of gray (10YR 5/1),
calcareous clay (Taylor et al. 1991:116).
Venus soils are nearly level and gently sloping deep, limy soils formed in loamy earths. Venus
clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, occurs as smooth terraces overlooking the flood plains of the San
Antonio and Media rivers and their main tributaries in the southern and southwestern parts of the
county (Taylor et al. 1991:32–33). Typically, the A horizon of Venus loam consists of about 35.6
cm (14 in) of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), calcareous heavy loam. Approximately 40.6 cm
(16 in) of brown (10YR 5/3) calcareous heavy loam compose the AC horizon. The C horizon is
light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) calcareous heavy loam with concretions and lumps of calcium
carbonate (Taylor et al. 1991:116).

CLIMATE
Bexar County is located on the edge of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, resulting in a modified
subtropical climate. The summer is hot, and daily maximum temperatures exceed 90°F over 80
percent of the time. Normal mean temperatures range from a low of 62.3°F in January to a high
7

of 94.2°F in August. Mild weather prevails during much of the winter months; below-freezing
temperatures occur on an average of about 20 days each year. Relative humidity averages about
80 percent during the early morning hours most of the year, and drops to near 50 percent in the
late afternoons.
San Antonio is situated between a semi-arid area to the west and the coastal area of heavy
precipitation to the southeast. The average annual rainfall of 70.8 cm (27.89 in) is sufficient for
the normal production of most crops. Precipitation is fairly well distributed throughout the year,
with the heaviest amounts occurring during May and September. Precipitation from April
through September usually occurs with thunderstorms in which fairly large amounts fall in short
periods of time, but most of the winter precipitation occurs as light rain or drizzle. Because of its
proximity to the Gulf, storms of a tropical nature also occur and result in high winds and
prolonged rainfall. Thunderstorms and heavy rainfalls have occurred in all months of the year.
Hail of damaging intensity seldom occurs, but light hail is frequent in connection with the
springtime thunderstorms. Measurable snow occurs only once in three or four years (Taylor et al.
1991:118–121).

FLORA AND FAUNA
Bexar County is situated in a transitional zone between three physiographic regions, and
therefore, the flora is a mixture of three biotic provinces: the Balconian (associated with the
Edwards Plateau), the Texan (associated with the Blackland Prairie), and the Tamaulipan
(associated with the South Texas Coastal Plain). Each is represented to varying degrees (Blair
1950).
Because of this transitional setting, the indigenous native vegetation was likely quite diverse and
abundant. Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), and panic
grass (Panicum sp.) are considered the dominant climax species, but other grasses such as big
bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), Indian grass (Sorghastrum avenaceum), switchgrass (Panicum
virgatum), and side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) also would be found. Among the
grasses were a wide variety of wildflowers including Indian blanket (Gaillardia pulchella),
upright prairie coneflower (Ratibida columnaris), coreopsis (Coreopsis sp.), and Drummond
skullcup (Scutellaria drummondii). Along waterways, woodlands consisted of cedar elm (Ulmus
crassifolia), netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), and pecan
(Carya illinoinensis) trees.
The indigenous native prairie supported herds of buffalo (Bison bison), antelope (Antilocapra
americana), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), peccary (Pecar tajacu), and numerous
game birds. The urbanization of the area has caused most of the larger and more sensitive
animals to vacate. The present fauna can be divided into two regimes: those inhabiting the
urbanized portion and those inhabiting the bottomlands. Urban-tolerant animal and bird species
include fox squirrels (Sciurus niger), English sparrows, rusty blackbirds, grackles, mockingbirds,
robins, and chickadees. The bottomlands form a more protected habitat for wilder species.
Beaver (Castor canadensis), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), skunks (Mephitis mephitis),
cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus sp.), and opossums (Didelphis virginiana) inhabit the bottomlands.
The number of bird species that visit bottomlands also may be high, as large numbers of birds
have been sighted in Bexar County. Fish species such as black bullhead (Ictalurus melas),
mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), sailfin molly (Poecillia latipinna), warmouth (Lepomis
8

gulosus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), Rio Grande
perch (Cichlasoma cyanoguttatum), as well as introduced species of mouthbrooders, may inhabit
the wetlands.

CHAPTER 3
HISTORIC CONTEXT

CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
The project area falls within the southern portion of the Central Texas archeological region. The
archeological record for Central Texas reflects the full North American cultural sequence;
therefore, evidence of human occupation spans a time period of roughly 12,000 years. The
Central Texas cultural sequence presented in the following discussion is divided into regionspecific cultural-historical periods within four broad cultural stages—Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic—that differentiate the broadly recognized North American cultural
trends (Table 1). These four major cultural stages briefly summarized in the following cultural
history of the Southcentral Texas project area are derived primarily from the work of Black
(1989), Prewitt (1981, 1985), Suhm (1960), Suhm et al. (1954), and Weir (1976).

Paleo-Indian (10,000–6000 B.C.)
The earliest widely accepted human occupation of North America is termed the Paleo-Indian
stage (10,000–6000 B.C.). Cooler, wetter conditions were in place 12,000 years ago, and
although a general drying trend continued through Paleo-Indian times, climatic conditions were
more stable than during the subsequent Holocene. This period is often characterized as a culture
of small but highly mobile bands of foragers who were specialized hunters of Pleistocene
megafauna. Most Paleo-Indian sites are deeply buried and difficult to find, leaving the highly
visible, often fortuitously discovered, mammoth kill sites as the primary evidence of Paleo-Indian
life-ways. Recent studies address this bias and emphasize that large kills probably contributed
little to overall food requirements. Rather, a primary reliance on other game animals and plant
resources was more likely (Ferring 1989). Subsistence in this period certainly included large
herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but was probably based more consistently on
smaller animals such as various species of turtle, land tortoise, alligator, mice, badger, and
raccoon (Collins et al. 1989; Story 1990) and, presumably, included an array of plants (Collins
1998). The defining Paleo-Indian trait is the fluted point tradition. Projectile points of the Early
Paleo-Indian period were made from high quality toolstone and indicate high technical skill in
flaking, exhibiting a hallmark “flute,” which is a long, shallow flake scar that extends from the
base toward the tip of the point on one or both sides.

As across North America, the Paleo-Indian stage is the earliest substantiated cultural period in
Texas. The Paleo-Indian stage in Central Texas falls into early and late subperiods, which
encompass three archeological complexes. The Llano and Folsom complexes comprise the Early
Paleo-Indian subperiod (10,000–8000 B.C.), and the Late Paleo-Indian (8000–6000 B.C.) reflects
the Plano complex. These complexes are not unique to Central Texas, for their ranges extended
into the Southwest and Great Plains. The Early Paleo-Indian subperiod is based on two projectile
point styles: Clovis and Folsom.
The Llano complex is represented by the Clovis projectile point, the oldest point type found in
North America. Much research energy has been devoted to the makers of Clovis points, but the
material record of Llano peoples is largely limited to hunting activities. Clovis assemblages
include the diagnostic fluted lanceolate Clovis point, along with engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, and ochre (Collins 1995; Collins et al. 1992). Sites with Clovis components
reported in Central Texas include Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, Gault, Horn Shelter 2,
Pavo Real, and Crockett Gardens. Surface finds of distinctive Clovis points are reported from a
number of other localities (Meltzer and Bever 1995).
By about 11,000 years ago the cool, wet climatic conditions of the Pleistocene had given way to
Holocene warming and drying. This change coincides with the extinction of Pleistocene
megafauna, most notably the mammoth, and is concurrent with the earliest record of the Folsom
complex. Like the Llano complex, the Folsom complex is best known for the Folsom projectile
point. Shorter than Clovis points, “classic” Folsom points exhibit fine parallel flaking and large
flutes that extend across most of each face. Midland points, commonly believed to occur later in
time, may represent unfluted Folsom points, apparently made to offset the production risks
involved in fluting (Amick 1995). Another trademark of the Folsom complex is the association
of Folsom points with the remains of now-extinct bison (Bison antiquus), usually found in the
context of massive kills of bison herds run into ravines. Such sites are conspicuous, and thus
much of what is known about Folsom subsistence and technology comes from lithic artifacts
found at these sites or nearby processing sites. Folsom tool kits consisted of the fluted Folsom
and the thin, unfluted (Midland) points, large thinned bifaces, and end scrapers that were more
conducive to specialized hunting, particularly of Bison antiquus (Collins 1995:382).
12

By approximately 10,000 years ago, the climate trended toward more moderate conditions, and
the megafauna from the Early Paleo-Indian subperiod were no longer available. Most of the
associated faunal evidence dated to the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex reflects a human
subsistence pattern based on deer and other smaller animals. Horn Shelter No. 2 (Forrester 1985)
located on the Brazos River in Bosque County, Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977) in Val
Verde County, and Wilson-Leonard (Collins 1998) in Williamson County have yielded
subsistence data indicating that a variety of vertebrate fauna was consumed by the Late PaleoIndian peoples.
The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex is represented by a greater diversity of projectile points
(e.g., Plainview, Angostura, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina), which, still in lanceolate form, were
unfluted. In contrast to evidence from the earlier subperiod, late subperiod points are associated
with modern bison (Bison bison) and often occur as surface finds throughout Central Texas. The
beginning of Prewitt’s (1981) Early Archaic, or Circleville phase, is considered in this report as
the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex but has also been called the “Pre-Archaic” (see Sollberger
and Hester 1972). The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex defies convenient labeling, as it exhibits
a unique blend of lanceolate and stemmed points that appear to correspond with life-ways
reflective of Archaic subsistence alongside Paleo-Indian mobility. Again, little is known about
the complex in Central Texas, but toward the latter part of the Late Paleo-Indian period,
lanceolate points began to be replaced by stemmed points. Settlement-subsistence strategies
probably more closely approximated those of the Archaic than Early Paleo-Indian. More diverse
sites are associated with this period, including not only the mass bison kills, which by the Late
Paleo-Indian period consist only of modern bison (Bison bison), but also campsites and
residences. The characteristics of the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall
components are more Archaic-like in that burned rock features are found, although the features
are much smaller and contain less rock that the burned rock features in the subsequent Archaic.

Archaic (6000 B.C.–A.D. 800)
Toward the end of the Late Paleo-Indian period, a great variety of projectile point styles began to
appear. The subsequent Archaic period (6000 B.C.–A.D. 800) is broadly characterized by
stemmed and side-notched dart points and by the appearance of ground and pecked stone tools.
The Archaic represents a more generalized style of hunting and gathering as a way of life, and the
subsistence pattern may have become more diffuse, reflecting a greater exploitation of local
environments as smaller game animals, fish, and wild plant foods increased in dietary importance.
Like their predecessors, Archaic peoples apparently continued to follow a nomadic way of life,
traveling seasonally to utilize different food resources in various localities (cf. Weir 1976).
McGraw and Hindes (1987:47) have noted that:
In northern and central Bexar County, major occupation sites are situated on stream terraces and are
usually associated with one or a series of spatially proximate, often buried, burned rock middens. An
extensive distribution of chipped stone debitage and a variety of diagnostic projectile points indicate
recurring occupations that span several thousand years. Major Late Prehistoric sites, in contrast, are
often physically discrete from these earlier sites.

The Archaic is generally divided into early, middle, and late subperiods (Black 1989; Collins
1995; Story 1985) based on diagnostic projectile point styles and associated radiocarbon assays
(Collins 1995). By the Middle Archaic in Central Texas, some regional distinctiveness is
apparent archeologically, as evidenced primarily by increased techno-stylistic diversity among
projectile point types. Interplay between influential factors of population increase and
13

environmental change toward greater aridity and climatic variability probably drove adaptive
change throughout the Archaic. The following discussion follows Story’s (1985) broader
subdivisions of the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic, although Prewitt’s (1981) discussion of
various phases within these periods provides much of the information discussed.
The most archeologically obvious changes from the Paleo-Indian to the Early Archaic (6000–
3000 B.C.) are the appearance of ground stone implements and the shift from the lanceolate points
of the Paleo-Indian tradition to the stemmed and side-notched dart points emblematic of the
Archaic. Three recognized point styles (Angostura, Early Split Stem [Gower and Jetta], and
Martindale-Uvalde) indicate that the makers tended to occupy the better-watered eastern part of
the Edwards Plateau (Collins 1998:65). Assemblages also include Clear Fork and Guadalupe
bifaces, manos, metates, hammerstones, burins, circular scrapers, and a variety of bifaces. Few
burials have been assigned to this period (Prewitt 1981:77–79; Story 1985:34–35), and
settlement/subsistence systems are “hypothesized to have been diffuse, utilizing a variety of
resources and frequently shifting the loci of subsistence activities rather than intensifying the use
of any specified resource” (Story 1985:39).
Projectile point types constitute the primary source of information about the Early Archaic, but
Prewitt (1981, 1985) uses point types to define four phases: the Circleville, San Geronimo,
Jarrell, and Oakalla, respectively. This refinement is criticized by some as unsubstantiated since
few intact sites are known (see Black 1989:26; Black and McGraw 1985), but the tendency for
many Early Archaic sites to occur around the Balcones Escarpment leads several researchers to
infer that this area was a refuge from drier conditions in Central Texas and on the coastal plains
(McKinney 1981; Story 1985). Concentrations of Early Archaic sites along the southern and
eastern margins of the Edwards Plateau may be indicative of climatic conditions at the time, as
these environments had more reliable water sources and a diverse subsistence base. The margins
of the Edwards Plateau are ecotonal in character and may have provided reliable resources during
times of environmental stress (Story 1985:31, 34). Convincing paleoenvironmental data on the
climatic conditions of this period is, nonetheless, still lacking.
Early Archaic sites are small (Weir 1976:115–122), suggesting that populations were highly
mobile and that their densities were low (Prewitt 1985:217). Early Archaic sites are usually
described as open campsites (such as Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Jetta,
Court, Youngsport, Camp Pearl Wheat, and Landslide) or lithic procurement stations. Only a few
campsites located in rockshelters (Kincaid Rockshelter) occur on the Edwards Plateau during this
period. The location of lithic procurement sites is determined by the natural distribution of
cherts. Large and varied burned-rock features (Sleeper, Camp Pearl Wheat, Wilson-Leonard,
Richard Beene) become common in the latter part of the Early Archaic, and domestic structures
(Turkey Bend Ranch) and caches (Linder) are also known in the Early Archaic (Collins 1998:64).
Fresh-water mussel, deer, and small game appear to have been important food resources. Hearths
are occasionally found at Early Archaic sites and can be stone-lined, basin-shaped, or flat. The
appearance of ground stone signifies a shift to plant resources, and the diversification of lithic
technology appears to reflect an increased reliance on gathering.
The Middle Archaic (3000–1000 B.C.) marks the first period of Central Texas distinctiveness as
an archeological region. The subperiod exhibits more numerous and more varied sites than the
preceding Early Archaic. This cultural manifestation is characterized by a population increase;
the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns; and changes in settlement patterns,
economic and social systems, and technology (Prewitt 1985). In addition, territorial boundaries
may have begun to emerge (Story 1985:39).
14

Burned-rock middens, which often consist of massive amounts of fire-cracked limestone, are,
however, the preeminent archeological features of the Middle Archaic. Many of these middens
may represent earthen ovens used to process live oak acorns (see Peter 1982, Weir 1976), as well
as for roasting succulents or other plants and animals. Many Central Texas tree species
disappeared from the paleoenvironmental record at this time, leaving live oak forests to dominate
the landscape. A renewed focus on deer, which themselves were well suited for the oak-savanna
environment, is likely. Weir (1976:124–130) suggests that an expansion of oak forests influenced
the development of an economic system that focused on the exploitation of deer, acorns, and
other hardwood nuts. Prewitt (1985:222–226) notes that the abundance of rock middens indicates
a greater reliance on plant foods, although tool kits still imply a strong reliance on hunting.
Middle Archaic sites in Central Texas are represented by rockshelters, campsites, lithic quarries,
and kill sites (Weir 1976), as well as by the burned rock middens that first appeared toward the
end of the Early Archaic. Other features include basin hearths and large flat hearths. Data
concerning mortuary practices are not available except for the end of the Middle Archaic, for
which cremations have been reported (Prewitt 1981:81). Three generalized point styles
characterize this subperiod: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis. Bifaces, a
variety of scrapers, unifaces, and grinding stones are also present. Prewitt (1981:73) suggests that
the proportion of projectile points compared to total number of tools (50 percent) is indicative of
a balance between the exploitation of plant and animal resources.
Late Archaic (1000 B.C.–A.D. 800) life-ways began similarly to those of the Middle Archaic, but
notable changes occurred, characterized by the emergence of new cultural patterns as well as the
intensification of preexisting ones (Story 1985:45). Coastal marine shells, used either as
ornaments or as raw materials for ornaments, were exchanged with inland groups, at least on a
limited basis, in return for finished lithic tools and/or siliceous raw material (Story 1985:48). The
use of burned rock middens throughout the Late Archaic appears to have been a major part of the
subsistence strategy as a decrease in the importance of hunting, inferred from the low ratio of
projectile points in relation to other tools in site assemblages, may have occurred (Prewitt
1981:74). Bison, which had been absent from the area for most of the Archaic, however, were
once again available in the region (Dillehay 1974).
Late Archaic sites include rockshelters, campsites, and large cemeteries. The establishment of
these large cemeteries along drainages suggests strong territorial ties by certain groups (Story
1985:40). In addition to cemeteries (e.g., Orchard [41BX1]; Story 1985:49), isolated flexed
burials have been recorded for this period (Prewitt 1981:81–82). Features include basin hearths,
arcuate hearths, and mussel shell caches. The lithic assemblages contain a variety of dart point
styles (e.g., Bulverde, Pedernales-Kinney, Lange-Williams-Marshall, Marcos-MontellCastroville, Ensor-Frio-Fairland, and Darl); Erath, San Gabriel, and Hare bifaces; gravers;
scrapers; a variety of unifaces and bifaces; grinding stones; and boatstones. Except for Montell
and Fairland, the point styles for the Late Archaic are among the most widely distributed dart
points (Prewitt 1985). Other artifacts include ulna flakers, bone beads and awls, stone and marine
shell gorgets, and fresh-water mussel shell pendants (Prewitt 1981:81–82).

Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800–1500)
The Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800–1500) is marked by the replacement of the atlatl-and-dart
with bow-and-arrow technology. Ceramics were also adopted within this period. Basin-shaped
and flat hearths and burned clay/charcoal lenses and pits are the predominant archeological
15

features. Flexed and semiflexed burials occur near habitation sites, usually in cemeteries but also
as isolated occurrences, a continuation of Late Archaic burial practices. Some burials were
cremations, carried away from cemeteries and placed in shallow pits.
The Late Prehistoric chronology in South Texas is closely aligned with that of Central Texas,
particular in terms of Toyah cultural manifestations (Hester 1995:443). The period is divided into
two main periods, the Austin and Toyah, and each is marked by distinctive cultural traits. Once
believed to be contemporaneous, Jelks’s (1953, 1962) work at the Blum Rockshelter and the Kyle
site demonstrated the temporal separation between Austin and Toyah components by locating
stratigraphically distinct Perdiz arrow points above older Austin phase Scallorn arrow points.
Each phase is discussed below.

Austin Phase
The Austin phase is characterized by a shift to the use of the bow and arrow. Common are
Scallorn and other related South Texas side-notched (e.g., Edwards) arrow points, with broadbased hunting and gathering as the main mode of subsistence (Turner and Hester 1999:173).
Common artifacts for this period include numerous bifaces, Clear Fork gouges, scrapers, grinding
stones. Typical features include basin hearths, pits, and cemeteries. The broad-based subsistence
patterns focused largely on gathering, though hunting of deer and exploitation of fresh-water
mussels and snails is also suggested to have been important (Prewitt 1981:83; Rickliss and
Collins 1994). The diagnostic projectile points of the Austin phase are the Scallorn and
Granbury. A wide variety of tools is found, including Friday bifaces and unifaces, other bifaces,
scrapers, ground stone, ulna flakers, and bone awls. Other artifacts include painted stones, bone
beads, and marine shell beads and pendants. Projectile points are proportionately more common
during the Austin phase as hunting appears to have become increasingly important. The
widespread occurrence of Scallorn points outside of Central Texas and the frequency of marine
shell indicate a broad cultural entity and/or extensive trade networks in the Late Prehistoric.

Toyah Phase
The Toyah phase is the best known of the Late Prehistoric phases. It is distinct from the
preceding Austin phase and is marked archeologically by Perdiz and similar contracting-stem
arrow points, pottery, beveled-edge bifacial knives, perforators, and end scrapers (Black 1986,
1989; Creel 1991; Hester 1980, 1995; Jelks 1962; Johnson 1994; Kelley 1986; Prewitt 1981).
Perishable artifacts such as cordage and basketry are found at some sites. Corncobs have also
been recovered, indicating either trade relations with agricultural peoples or some degree of
horticulture (Prewitt 1981:74). Extensive trade relations are also indicated by the presence of
Caddoan ceramics, such as Bullard Brushed, among other imported types. Toyah phase burials
sometimes contain artifacts, but it is not established that these are grave goods. Perdiz and
Cliffton points found in burials may be from fatal wounds and indicative of increased conflict.
During the Toyah phase, a climatic shift to moister conditions allowed the savannas and
grasslands to advance, bringing the return of the bison. Subsistence strategies shifted even further
toward hunting in response to the reoccupation of Central Texas by bison (Dillehay 1974). Deer,
however, probably continued to be an important resource (Black and McGraw 1985). The
importance of bison to the Toyah economy is readily deduced from the makeup of artifact
16

assemblages represented at a number of archeological sites. The Buckhollow site (41KM16)
produced an abundance of Perdiz arrow points consisting of many varieties (Johnson 1994). Also
found were Harahey knives, most of them exhibiting four beveled edges. The use wear is
representative of cutting bison hides and flesh—a hypothesis supported by the recovery of large
numbers of bison bones. Also indicative of the importance of bison is the recovery of large end
scrapers from the site. The presence of edge rounding and polish on bit ends indicates use on
fresh hides, most of which were probably bison (Johnson 1994). The Hinojosa site (41JW8),
located in Jim Wells County in southern Texas, represents a Late Prehistoric Toyah base camp
dating from A.D. 1300 to 1500 (Black 1986). Specialized hunting adaptations are evident from
the archeological materials, though a broad subsistence base including fish, softshell turtle,
aquatic birds, and mussel shell was also exploited. Deer figured prominently in the overall
assemblage, with bison and pronghorn antelope also contributing a significant portion to overall
subsistence (Black 1986). A significant component of the highly adaptive bison-oriented Toyah
phase tool kit are end scrapers used for processing hides. Creel (1991) has suggested that these
tools are indicative of the importance of trade in bison hides during the Late Prehistoric and early
historic periods. Bison bones occur in great frequency in many Late Prehistoric Toyah phase
sites. Excavations at 41LK201 and 41MC222 along the Frio River drainage contained abundant
bison bone, with the latter site dating to around A.D. 1260 to 1290 (Hester 1980; Highley 1986).

Historic (post-A.D. 1525)
The historic period in Central Texas corresponds to the local expression of sweeping cultural
change for native peoples across North America. Spanish missionization represents the first
European influence in Texas, but it probably did not have dramatic effects until native groups
sought refuge at the missions in the 1600s from encroaching Apache and, later, Comanche
groups. Changes through gradual cultural adoption and exchange of Spanish life-ways and
materials occurred throughout the seventeenth century. After the 1700s, European material
culture became pervasive. Metal, glass, European clothing, and guns became important to native
peoples, replacing traditional items. In the post-1900 period, farming and ranching have been the
primary land use activity in Bexar County.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Site 41BX1623 was identified during a July 2005 survey of the proposed linear pipeline corridor
for SAWS (Tiné and Kuehn 2005). The southeastern end of the corridor approaches the San
Antonio River and crosses a finger of Holocene terrace deposits. Cultural materials were
recorded in two mechanical trenches and on the surface of a plowed agricultural field located atop
the terrace tread. Six trenches were excavated in the plowed fallow field in the central and
western portions of the site and two were located in an unplowed, treed area in the eastern portion
of the site. A ninth trench was placed on a small bench-like landform below, and to the southeast,
of the site area. The six trenches in the field contained no subsurface cultural materials, but the
two trenches within the wooded portion of the terrace did. In these trenches, two separate
components were recorded. The upper component was located between 14 cm and 25 cm in
depth and contained flakes, cores, fire-cracked rock, mussel shell, and bone. The lower
component averaged 60 cm in depth and contained sparse flaking debris, fire-cracked rock, and
charcoal.

17

Prior to the initial survey of the site by GMI in 2005, records curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) were consulted to identify previously recorded archeological sites
in or near the project area. No other documented sites occur within the actual project corridor;
however, 16 sites have been recorded within a 1-mile radius of the present project area. Data for
these sites are presented in Table 2.

Recorded sites within 1 mile of project area based on TARL site form records
Center for Archeological Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio

Site 41BX124, a campsite of unknown age, appears to have been originally recorded by an
individual and was later investigated during a professional archeological survey by CAR-UTSA
(see Table 2). The remainder of the previously recorded sites within the search radius was
identified during professional cultural resources management investigations. Most of the sites
occur on terraces, usually overlooking the San Antonio River or one of its tributaries. However,
18

two sites, 41BX692 and 41BX693, were identified in gravel bars along the river north of the
project corridor and likely represent materials transported from elsewhere. All sites but
41BX1374 are either prehistoric or have a primarily prehistoric component. These sites are
mostly lithic scatters, occasionally with ceramics, bone, or shell, observed on eroded or plowed
surfaces. Site 41BX1374 consists of several historic farmstead structures and historic artifacts
with two flakes recovered from shovel tests.
Among the sites within the search radius, seven (41BX1371, 41BX1372, 41BX1373, 41BX1374,
41BX1375, 41BX1377, and 41BX1475) were identified by GMI between 1999 and 2002 during
investigations for the SAWS Dos Rios/Salado interconnect sewer line (Duke et al. 2002)—the
line with which the proposed Blue Wing pipeline will interconnect. All sites except 41BX1475
were determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Site 41BX1475, approximately one
mile north of the project area, differs from the other prehistoric sites in that it represents the
deepest identified deposit within the search radius. The site was identified by burned rock
fragments and mussel shell in the walls of a series of backhoe trenches excavated 90–130 cm
(27.3–39.4 in) below ground surface (bs). Its eligibility status remains undetermined because the
project route was altered to avoid the site.
Five of the nine sites not related to the GMI Dos Rios investigations were declared ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP because they were sparse in artifacts and/or disturbed. Of the remaining
four sites, no recommendation for NRHP eligibility could be made based on the level of effort for
the project, and additional testing to better assess the site extent and integrity was recommended.
Absence of any follow-up records suggests that the respective projects probably avoided these
sites, and their NRHP eligibility remains undetermined.

CHAPTER 4
METHODS

FIELD METHODS
The geomorphic setting of site 41BX1623 on a terrace of the San Antonio River and the
demonstrated presence of buried archeological deposits necessitated additional backhoe trenching
and archeological testing along the new alignment of the pipeline corridor. Plans called for
placing the pipeline approximately 9 ft (2.7 m) below surface, or the alternate possible
consideration of boring below the site. Therefore, these construction plans required that cultural
resources trenches be excavated to a depth of 12 ft (3.7 m) below surface. Trenches were
excavated along the long axis of the marked corridor and typically measured 10 m (33 ft) in
length and 1 m (3.3 ft) in width.

Geoarcheological/Geomorphic Investigations
The geoarcheological investigations were conducted utilizing surface inventory and stratigraphic
backhoe trenches. Subsurface context was interpreted through the analysis of backhoe trenches
excavated within the pipeline easement. The backhoe trench walls were scraped and carefully
examined for cultural materials and other evidence of prehistoric cultural occupation. During
excavation of archeological test units, the geoarcheologist remained on site to observe the cultural
deposits within their stratigraphic placement.
The geoarcheological investigations served to (1) to interpret the geomorphic and pedogenic
context of archeological materials at the site; and (2) to assess the systemic integrity of the site
components. These goals were accomplished by examining the soil and stratigraphic
composition of site sediments, interpreting the sedimentary depositional environment associated
with artifact-bearing sediments; and reconstructing noncultural site formation processes within
the site area (cf. Gladfelter 2001; Waters 1992).
After excavation, the trench walls were carefully examined for the presence of cultural materials,
and stratigraphic profile drawings were made of one wall of each trench. Stratigraphic units
visible in the trench walls were identified on the basis of bounding unconformities, in this case by
the presence of buried or surface soils (cf. North American Commission on Stratigraphic
21

Nomenclature [NACOSN] 1983). During the profiling, soils and sediments exposed in the trench
profiles were described and recorded following the procedures outlined in the Soil Survey Staff
(1951; 1990) and Boggs (1987). Samples of each soil horizon were collected and analyzed at the
El Paso, Texas, office of Geo-Marine, Inc. Attributes recorded included texture, structure,
consistence, color (i.e., Munsell), soil horizon morphology, horizon boundary characteristics, soil
carbonate morphology, and reaction to 10% HCL.

Archeological Investigations
Trench walls and floors were inspected for artifacts, features, and soil horizon. Profile walls of
trenches were photographed when possible, and soil profiles were recorded. When cultural
materials were encountered in a trench wall, they were recorded on the stratigraphic profile drawn
by the geoarcheologist. The chosen location for controlled excavation test units was based on the
identification and frequency of cultural materials identified in the backhoe trenches. Six test units
were excavated during the current project. Each was located adjacent to the backhoe trenches in
order to investigate areas of interest exposed in profile. The test units varied in size from .5-x-.5m units and 1-x-.5-m units, to one 1-x-1-m unit. Excavation proceeded in 10-cm arbitrary levels
separated by stratigraphic breaks when encountered. In some cases, test units were also broken
into 5-cm levels to pinpoint the vertical separation of distinct cultural components.
Because test units were excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels while observing natural stratigraphy,
depths below ground surface for individual levels are generally consistent across the site,
allowing for correlation and comparison of recovered materials by depth from unit to unit. Soil
strata were defined and recorded on unit level sheets and wall profile drawings using standard
USDA textural classifications and Munsell color charts. Measured metric scale-drawings were
made of plan views when any cultural features were encountered. All sediments excavated from
these test units were screened through 6.35-millimeter (mm; 0.25 in) hardware cloth. All artifacts
recovered from test units were collected, bagged, and labeled by site number, test unit number,
test unit coordinates, stratigraphic layer, arbitrary level, date, and name of the excavator. During
excavations, all soil anomalies, artifact concentrations, or diagnostic artifacts were piece-plotted
on test unit level floor plans and designated by grid coordinates relative to the SW corner datum
of each individual test unit.

LABORATORY METHODS
Recovered artifacts were briefly examined, inventoried, and bagged in the field. Upon arrival at
the GMI laboratory, artifacts were cleaned, catalogued, and labeled according to federal
guidelines, followed by intensive artifact analyses. All artifacts were analyzed either by the
project archeologist or by specialized analysts. Each artifact was thoroughly examined in order to
identify and determine, to the extent possible, its function/role and cultural/chronological
affiliation within the identified contexts. These analytical results are presented in the following
chapters, and the raw data are provided in Appendix C. Collected artifacts—other than FCR—
photographs, and notes concerning this project will be permanently curated at the Center for
Archaeological Research, University of Texas at San Antonio. The FCR was counted and
weighed before it was discarded.

22

Lithic Artifact Analysis Framework
The goal of the lithic analysis was to provide information about site function; technology,
production, and lithic source procurement (exchange/interaction); and cultural affiliation based on
the presence of diagnostic chipped stone tool types. In order to address these diverse issues, the
stone materials were initially separated into five main classes: (1) chipped stone tools, (2)
chipped stone debitage, (3) cores, (4) ground, pecked, and battered stone artifacts, and (5)
unworked stone (fire-cracked rock and manuports). The detailed analysis as encoded in the
database is presented in Appendix C.
All artifacts were examined macroscopically, and occasionally with a 15X hand lens, to identify
signs of use and wear. Only stone pieces with formal retouch, or consistent incidental flake scars,
or formal shaping were classified as tools. Other lithic materials were classified as either chipped
stone or nonchipped stone (i.e., ground stone) with chipped stone materials being further
classified as either debitage or cores. Lithic items such as fire-cracked rock or manuports were
classified as unworked stone materials culturally associated with the site. No high power usewear analysis of the modified edges to verify inferred functions of the implements was
conducted.

Chipped Stone
Chipped stone lithic materials (lithic classes 1–3) were sorted by class or implement type, stone
tool material type (siltstone, chert, etc.), condition (proximal, medial, distal, unknown), percent of
cortex present (100 percent, primary; 1–99 percent, secondary; or 0 percent, tertiary), size, and
evidence of heat treatment as indicated by potlids, crazing, or discoloration. These attributes and
counts were recorded.
Lithic raw material types were identified by attributes of texture, color, luster, and rock
classification. Many of the cherts identified were obviously river gravels from the San Antonio
River. A gravel and cobble bar currently located just below the terrace exhibits many of these
same chert cobble types. River gravels tend to have rounded edges and a yellow-brown stain.
Similarly, instances of thermal alteration were noted by the occurrence of heat treatment or
damage as indicate by potlidded surfaces, crazing, or reddish discoloration.

Lithic Class 1: Chipped Stone Tools
Chipped stone artifacts with formal symmetrical or asymmetrical shaping or exhibiting
systematic unifacial or bifacial flake scars were regarded as tools, separate and distinct from cores
or debitage. Chipped stone tools were separated into three classes: (1) projectile points or
portions of projectile points (established as a distinct category because many are time and
culturally diagnostic), (2) bifacial implements, and (3) unifacial implements. The size of each
individual piece was measured to the nearest tenth of a millimeter using spreading calipers. Other
observations include the amount of extant cortex, stone material type, and condition. Each tool
was counted and attributes recorded.

23

Projectile points were classified as haftable bifaces with a defined base, stem, and shoulders. The
distinction between dart (large) and arrow (small) points was based on overall size. If sufficient
amount of the point was present, it was compared to established named types (Turner and Hester
1999). These names form the basis for ascertaining the associated cultural affiliations and time
periods.
Bifacial implements refer to nonprojectile point implements with modifications on both faces. A
generalized biface, rather than an elaborate form, was classified according to the Callahan biface
reduction or manufacturing stages (Callahan 1979). Callahan’s Stage 1 was not used, since it
refers to an unmodified and unshaped blank suitable for making a biface. The following are
summaries of Callahan’s Biface Stages 2 through 5:
• Stage 2 biface, also called a rough out, generally has little emphasis on shape reduction or
thinning, but instead has a few large flake scars removed to create an initial bifacial
working edge around the circumference of the objective piece. These crude bifaces tend to
be thick relative to width, a ratio of 2 to 3, and have very sinuous edges and no emphasis on
reduction in the middle of the biface.
• Stage 3 biface, also called a primary preform, exhibits initial stages of thinning and
shaping. These specimens show the initial efforts to drive flakes entirely across the face of
the implements and have lenticular cross sections and a centered biconvex edge. They tend
to be somewhat thinner (width to thickness ratio of 3 to 4), and have the beginning of a
generalized geometric shape and slightly less sinuous edges.
• Stage 4 biface, also called secondary preform, demonstrates a focus on creating a
symmetrical outline with a flattened, lenticular cross section and straighter, slightly
sinuous, centered, biconvex edges. The width to thickness ratio ranges from 4 to 5.
• Stage 5 biface, also called final or thinned preform, is symmetrical, with a relatively
parallel-sided outline reminiscent of the final tool shape. These bifaces have a flattened,
lenticular cross section and straight, nonsinuous edges. The width to thickness crosssection ratio ranges from 4 to 10.
Some bifacial implements were produced as other formal tools and were identified based on
specialized shape and functional requirements. Bifacial implements were classified by function,
such as knife, perforator/drill, graver, etc., or by Callahan production stage. Specific, named
biface types (e.g., Albany, Bristol, Harvey) can be recognized, although none were present in this
assemblage. Typology and terminology generally followed that provided by Turner and Hester
(1999).
Unifacial tools refer to formally and informally shaped implements with edge modification and
retouch solely on one face. Formally shaped artifacts include scrapers, Albany unifaces, etc.
Scrapers were subdivided into categories of end scrapers, side scrapers, end/side scrapers, and
scrapers with spurs based on the location of modification on the implement. Informally shaped
unifaces include edge-modified flakes, gravers, and notch/spokeshaves. Note that the descriptive
term modified flake is used to describe the macro-edge modifications visible on these pieces
rather than the term utilized flake, which is often based on judgmental opinion.

24

Lithic Class 2: Chipped Stone Debitage
Discarded remains from chipped stone tool manufacture are assigned to the category of chipped
stone debitage. Material in this class was sorted into subgroups of flakes (core, biface, blades,
notching flakes, tool rejuvenation, and indeterminate fragments), shatter, or potlids (thermally
altered spalls). All debitage was sorted by size range (less than 6.4 mm [¼ in], 6.4 to 12.7 mm [¼
to ½ in], 12.7 to 19.0 mm [½ to ¾ in], 19.0 to 25.4 mm [¾ to 1 in], 25.4 to 38.1 mm [1 to 1.5 in],
38.1 to 50.8 mm [1.5 to 2 in], and greater than 50.8 mm [2 in]. Source stone material type for all
debitage was identified. Other attributes included the amount of cortex present on the dorsal
surface (100 percent, 1–99 percent, 0 percent, platform only, indeterminate) and evidence of heat
treatment or thermal damage (none, discolored, potlidded, crazed, curved thermal spall).
Flake debris was defined as a sharp piece of stone with defined dorsal and ventral surfaces and, if
the platform was present, a series of attributes that delineated the striking point that removed the
flake from the core. In contrast to flakes, which can be oriented, the term “shatter” was applied to
angular blocky chunks of stone, with or without cortex that did not exhibit ripple marks, a bulb of
percussion, or other indications that would permit orientation of the specimen.
Whole and proximal flake portions that retain the striking platforms were further subdivided into
core or bifacial thinning flakes. The distinction was not based on a single attribute, but rather on
an impression of a cluster of attributes. Core flakes tend to be thick, with salient bulbs, steep
platform-dorsal surface angle, and no ridge crests across their platforms. In contrast, bifacial
thinning flakes tend to be thin, with acute platform-dorsal surface angle, one or more ridges on
the platform surface, and occasionally a lipped surface. The classification of core and biface
thinning flakes indicates the range of reduction present onsite. Medial and distal flake fragments
lacking a platform were classified as indeterminate. Blades are special kinds of flakes that
typically are twice as long as wide, but they also refer to a reduction strategy and the use of
specific kinds of cores.
Notching flakes are a relatively rare kind of small flake with a concavo-convex platform. They
are produced during the attempt to add notches to projectile points during initial manufacture.
Tool rejuvenation flakes reflect a special kind of knapping in which a flake is struck along the
margin of the working blade in order to remove a series of overhanging resharpening flake scars
(Shafer 1970). Typically, they are narrow curving flakes that have distinctive flake scars along
the dorsal ridge. The distinctive scars along the dorsal ridge can either be unifacial scars, many
with step or hinge scars, or bifacial flake removals with comparable damage.

Lithic Class 3: Chipped Stone Cores
Cores refer to raw nodules or reduced objective pieces that are either used to produce individual
flakes to be fashioned into tools or represent the early stages of a cobble being reduced to
becoming a finished tool itself. Each core was classified by source stone type (siltstone,
novaculite, chert, etc.), condition (complete or broken), degree of cortex present, actual maximum
size measured with spreading calipers, and evidence of heat treatment or damage (discolored,
potlidded, crazed, etc.). Six analytical subclasses of core types were recognized.

25

Classifications for the six core types are based on the extent of flake scars and the pattern of flake
removals and consist of (1) tested cobbles, (2) amorphous cores, (3) prepared cores, (4) utilized
cores, (5) exhausted cores, and (6) indeterminate core fragments.
Tested cobbles are cores that usually have from one to five flake scar removals and were probably
broken to test the quality of tool stone before the nodules were brought back to the site.
Amorphous cores can be either expedient or opportunistic. Flake scars tend to be unpatterned,
and flake removals, instead, occurred according to the geometry of the original cobble.
Typically, flake scars may follow ridges and be randomly placed on the cobble.
Prepared cores show considerable consistency in the patterned removal of flakes, often in regular
series. Three subclasses of prepared cores reflect whether the flake removals are (1)
unidirectional (columnar/cylindrical [as in blade or bipolar flake removals], conical, or
pyramidal), (2) bidirectional (discoidal, tabular/bipolar, or polyhedral), or (3) multidirectional
(multifaceted or rhombic in form). It is important to realize that Callahan’s biface reduction
stages, discussed under bifacial tools above, could just as well be formal kinds of bifacially
prepared discoidal cores rather than tools. The significant criterion is that flakes were removed
from predominantly two directions, whether from around the perimeter of a discoidal stone or
from opposite directions on a tabular/bipolar core. Multidirectional or multifaceted cores are raw
nodules that retain patterned flake removals from three or more directions. These cores often take
advantage of ventral flake scars to develop new platforms for flake removals in different
directions.
Utilized cores refer to cores and pieces of cores that were recycled into other tool forms,
including hammerstones, pulping planes, or steep angled/edged tools with unifacial or bifacial
wear. Care must be taken to ensure that platform edge stabilization scars are not mistaken for
signs of use wear. These items may be linked to certain kinds of ground, pecked, and battered
tools.
Exhausted cores are small remnants of core forms that are very small and have little to no
remaining use. They tend to be remnants that are hard to classify because the knapping strategies
may have been altered to extract the last remnant of usable flake material. Despite their reduced
size and exhausted state, cores in this category are complete or nearly complete, rather than
representing small fragmentary remnants of larger core forms.
Indeterminate core fragments, the last core subclass, are primarily identified by the presence of
one or more large cleavage scars that may or may not coincide with fissures or flaws in the
cobble.

Ground Stone Tools and Unworked Stone
Ground stone is classified by tool type (e.g., abrader, hammerstone, mano, metate, polished stone,
etc.). The same attributes as those for chipped stone tools (extant portion, size, raw material, and
heat alteration, etc.) are recorded and each tool is counted.

26

The unworked stone classification denotes fire-cracked rock (i.e., stone subjected to intense heat
likely used for food preparation and in hearths) and manuports (i.e., whole, unmodified stones
deliberately brought onsite likely as a cache for later reduction for tool manufacture). Raw
material is identified when possible and the number of artifacts in each class is counted.

Faunal Analysis
Specimens collected in the field were assigned to class, order, suborder, family, genus, and
species according to their identifiability. Size classes (e.g., “deer size”) are used to describe
remains that bear no diagnostic features but are similar in size and shape to portions from a
particular element from a species. If a specimen is very close in shape and size to an element of a
particular taxon but bereft of reliable diagnostic features, then the identification is provided on a
comparative basis, for example as cf. Crotalus atrox, which means “compares favorably with
western diamondback rattlesnake.” Other snake remains are not identified beyond suborder
Serpentes. Given the low density of elements from the axial skeleton and the taxonomic overlap
in morphological characteristics of rib fragments in particular, several fragments are considered
“unidentified.” When identifications of such elements are possible, they are offered in terms of
size class (e.g., Bison size), which is a conservative approach. A short discussion of taphonomy
of the fauna is covered; no attention is devoted to site interpretation given the small size of the
fauna from 41BX1623 and its poor taphonomic condition. Specimens are counted using two
quantitative units NSP (number of specimens) and NISP (number of identified specimens)
(Lyman 1994). Because samples are small, MNIs (minimum number of individuals) are not
calculated.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Site 41BX1623 was identified during the 2005 GMI survey at the southeastern end of the
proposed linear pipeline corridor for SAWS. During initial geoarcheological investigations at the
site, eight backhoe trenches (Backhoe Trenches [BHTs] 1–8) were excavated in the site area. Six
of these (BHTs 2–7) were located in the plowed fallow field in the central and western portions of
the site and two (BHTs 1 and 8) were located in an unplowed, treed area in the eastern portion of
the site (Figure 4). A ninth trench (BHT 9) was placed on a small bench-like landform below,
and to the southeast, of the site area. The site spans the length of a finger of Holocene terrace
deposits just above the San Antonio River. It is within these deposits that cultural materials were
recorded in two mechanical backhoe trenches (BHTs 1 and 8) and were also observed on the
surface of the plowed agricultural field.
The eight original trenches excavated within the site revealed an A(Ap)-Bk-Btk soil horizon
sequence composed primarily of fine-grained overbank sediments (silty loam, clay loam, silty
clay). These soils extended from the surface to approximately 1.5 m bs (Tiné and Kuehn 2005).
In one of the original trenches (BHT 1), abundant cultural materials, in the form of flaking debris,
cores, fire-cracked rock, mussel shell, and bone, were observed in the trench walls in the A
horizon soil at depths that ranged from 14–25 cm (5.5–9.8 inches) bs. A possible second cultural
component was indicated in the Bk horizon, exposed in BHT 1 at a depth of 60 cm (23.6 inches)
bs, by the presence of fire-cracked rock and charcoal in the south wall of the profile and by the
presence of sparse flaking debris in the backdirt pile (Tiné and Kuehn 2005:19). No cultural
materials were observed in the underlying Btk horizon.
Evidence for at least one upper cultural component was also evident in BHT 8. Here flaking
debris and fire-cracked rock was identified in the backdirt pile and a piece of fire-cracked rock
was observed in the north wall of the trench at a depth of 25 to 30 cm bs (9.8 to 11.8 inches).
There was no evidence of a lower cultural component in BHT 8.

During initial investigations, no cultural materials were encountered in the six backhoe trenches
excavated in the plowed portion of the site (BHTs 2–7). Although artifacts were observed on the
surface of the plowed field, the backhoe trench profiles suggested that these were in disturbed
contexts. The Ap plow zone extended from the surface to a depth of 47 to 51 cm (18.5 to 20.1
inches) bs and was characterized by a clear irregular lower boundary (Tiné and Kuehn 2005:20).

CURRENT GEOARCHEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF SITE SETTING
During the present investigation of site 41BX1623, backhoe trenching was again used to test the
new corridor alignment. Trenching focused primarily on the eastern area beyond the plowed field
because the site was demonstrably disturbed in the field area. Controlled test excavations were
placed adjacent to test trenches in order to investigate and evaluate the cultural deposits that were
recorded in 2005 (Tiné and Kuehn 2005). Six backhoe trenches (BHTs 10–15) were placed along
the new corridor extending from the plowed field near the center of the site to the extreme eastern
end of the corridor near the pipeline link station (see Figure 4). Cultural materials were identified
in three of the trenches located on the terrace surface (BHTs 10, 13, and 14).
The geoarcheological investigations at 41BX1623 had two primary goals: (1) to interpret the
geomorphic and pedogenic context of archeological materials at the site; and (2) to assess the
systemic integrity of the site components. These goals were accomplished by examining the soil
and stratigraphic composition of site sediments, interpreting the sedimentary depositional
environment associated with artifact-bearing sediments; and by reconstructing noncultural site
formation processes within the site area (cf. Gladfelter 2001; Waters 1992). The data used to
address the project goals will be discussed during the following summary of the geoarcheological
investigations.
Three of the six backhoe trenches (BHTs 10, 14, and 15) were located on the flat tread of the
Applewhite-terrace equivalent (eq.) and one, BHT 13, was located along the margin of the terrace
tread. Two additional trenches (BHTs 11 and 12) were located on the sloping sides of the terrace
below, and to the east, of the site (see Figure 4). As stated, the trenches were taken to an average
depth of 3.9 m (12.8 ft) and ranged in length from 5 to 10 m. After excavation, the trench walls
were carefully examined for the presence of cultural materials, and stratigraphic profile drawings
were made of one wall of each trench. Stratigraphic units visible in the trench walls were
identified on the basis of bounding unconformities, in this case by the presence of buried or
surface soils (cf. NACOSN 1983).
These investigations revealed a generally homogeneous sequence of fine-grained alluvium and
moderately developed A-Bk-Btk-2Btk soils. These soils dominate the fill in the upper roughly 4–
5 m of the Applewhite-terrace eq. and reflect Holocene terrace aggradation under generally
similar fluvial environments. Despite similarities, some important differences in texture and
sedimentary facies relationships are evident in the backhoe trench profiles. These differences are
most evident in those trenches located on the upper portion of the terrace tread versus those
located on the sloping terrace scarp area below, and to the east, of the tread. Interpretation of the
soil and sediment data suggests that the differences are due to changing sedimentary facies within
an aggrading floodplain environment.
BHTs 10, 14, and 15 were placed in the terrace tread portion of the project area (see Figure 4).
Soils in these trenches exhibited A-Bk-Btk profiles of silty loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, and
clay (see Appendix A). Although texture and master horizon configurations were similar, lithic
discontinuities and variability in subordinate horizons were evident.
31

Three backhoe trenches (BHTs 11, 12, 13) were excavated on the sloping scarp of the Applewhite
eq. terrace at the extreme eastern end of the site (see Figure 4). Two of these trenches (BHT 11
and 13) were located in a bladed roadway, but the third (BHT 12) was located on an undisturbed,
wooded portion of the scarp. Soils exposed in the upper portion of these trenches were basically
similar, however soils in the bottom portions of the trenches were more physically and genetically
disparate. In all three trenches, near-surface horizons (A, Bk, Btk) were composed of finegrained overbank sediments (silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay). In BHTs 11 and 13,
the Bk/Btk soils were underlain by 2Bt and 2Btk clayey silts (lithic discontinuity). A lithic
discontinuity was also evident in the basal 2Btk horizon in BHT 12, but this soil had a higher clay
content than basal soils in BHTs 11 and 13 (silty clay versus clayey silt). These textural
differences suggest that different facies environments may have been operating within this
portion of the terrace/former floodplain (cf. Boggs 1987:305–307). The clayey sediments were
likely deposited under low-energy flood conditions (floodplain) or in areas of standing water
(backswamp), while the silty sediments appear to have been deposited in an upper point bar
sequence, under flood conditions that were intermediate between high- and low-energy discharge
(cf. Boggs 1987; Walker and Cant 1984). Archeological site preservation is considered generally
good in both environments; however, actual prehistoric occupation is less likely in areas of
standing water than it would be in more well-drained floodplain and/or point bar settings.

INTEGRATED ARCHEOLOGICAL RESULTS
The following discussion presents the results of mechanical trenching and archeological test unit
excavation of each of the six trenches (BHTs 10–15). The stratigraphic profile of each trench is
described in geomorphic terms as well as in relation to potential or demonstrated cultural
deposits. Controlled archeological test units were placed adjacent to the three trenches exhibiting
cultural materials (BHTs 10, 13, and 14) to investigate the components previously recorded by
Tiné and Kuehn (2005).

Backhoe Trench 10
Backhoe Trench 10 (BHT 10) was excavated along the centerline of the corridor and spans a
140º-turn. This trench was excavated to a length of 8.5 m (27.9 ft) and a maximum depth of
3.8 m (12.5 ft). In this area, the corridor extends from the tree line directly toward the corridor
previously surveyed in 2005 by Tiné and Kuehn and then turns away from it as it continues
toward the interconnect (see Figure 4). BHT 10 was placed only 6 m north of BHT 1 excavated
in 2005 (Tiné and Kuehn 2005) (see Figure 4). BHT 1 exposed two possible components; one at
14–25 cm bs containing chipped stone, fire-cracked rock, mussel shell, and bone, and a second at
approximately 60 cm bs containing fire-cracked rock, charcoal, and chipped stone found in the
backdirt.
Approximately 50 burned and unburned rocks were observed during excavation of BHT 10.
Additional materials observed in the walls of this trench included mussel shell, fire-cracked rock,
and chipped stone. This trench was temporarily terminated at 1.8 m (6 ft) to facilitate detailed
profiling. The cultural materials observed in the trench walls were plotted onto the geomorphic
profile at this time.

32

Backhoe Trench 10 revealed thick, well-developed soils reflecting pedogenesis under overbank
and possible backswamp depositional environments. The trench profile consisted of A-Bk-Btk1Btk2-2Btk horizons that extended from the ground surface to 3.9 m (12.8 ft) bs (Figure 5). The
surface A horizon (silty loam, 10YR 3/2 wet) was .35 m (1 ft) thick and characterized by weak
medium subangular blocky structure (see Appendix A). The horizon was associated with
abundant archeological materials, many of which were mapped in situ during the profiling (see
Figure 5). Cultural materials were also common in the Bk horizon (silty clay loam, 10YR 3/3
wet), which extended from .35 to .85 m bs (see Figure 5).

Figure

5.

Figure 5. Profile of BHT 10, south wall.

The Bk horizon exhibited Stage I carbonates (filaments) as defined by Gile et al. (1966). The
artifacts in the Bk horizon appear to represent a second, spatially distinct, cultural component
within the 41BX1623 site area. The Bk horizon overlies a 1.45-m-thick (4.8 ft) Btk horizon (silty
clay, 10YR 4/3 wet). This horizon was subdivided into Btk1 and Btk2 horizons on the basis of
soil carbonate morphology (Btk1 has Stage I carbonate filaments, but Btk2 has Stage II carbonate
filaments and nodules). The Btk2 horizon was underlain by a 1.6-m-thick (5.2 ft) 2Btk horizon
(clay, 10YR 4/4 wet). The 2Btk represents a lithic discontinuity, or a significant change in
texture, compared to the overlying horizon. Extending into the floor of the trench, the 2Btk clay
horizon appears to have been deposited under a different depositional environment from the
overlying sediments. The 2Btk may represent aggradation within a backswamp environment,
while the overlying A, Bk, and Btk horizons appear the result of general overbank conditions (cf.
Allen 1970; Walker and Cant 1984).

33

Relative concentrations of cultural materials observed in profile guided the placement of
controlled test excavation units adjacent to the trench. Test Units (TUs) 2 and 2.1 were placed
adjacent to one another along the trench (see Figure 4) to provide wider exposure to an area
containing burned rocks, chipped stone, mussel shell, and charcoal in profile. Test Unit 2 was a
.5-x-1-m unit, and TU 2.1 was a .5-x-.5-m unit. Test Unit 3 was placed 2.3 m west of TU 2.1
along the trench to expose an area where charcoal and chipped stone were observed in the south
trench wall (Figure 6).

nearest the camera.

Test Units 2 and 2.1
Test Units 2 and 2.1 were excavated to a maximum depth of 86 and 46 cm bs, respectively. Both
test units yielded cultural materials of bone, mussel shell, burned rock, thermally fractured chert,
and chipped stone in relatively high percentages from the surface down to approximately 35 cm
bs (Table 3). The stratigraphic break between the A horizon and the Bk horizon occurs at this
depth. Below this, no cultural materials are identified in the upper 5 cm of the Bk horizon. A
second package of cultural materials, and indeed a second component, is encountered at
approximately 41–46 cm bs (Figure 7).
A small burned rock feature (Feature 1) was mapped in TU 2 at the base of Level 3 (26–34 cm
bs) and corresponding with the bottom of the A horizon (Figure 8). This feature consisted of 23
burned rocks between 7 and 25 cm in size as well as numerous other smaller fragments lying on a
horizontal plane (Figure 9). The rock comprising this feature is identified primarily as limestone

with some sandstone and possible ferruginous sandstone being represented. It was apparent that
several other rocks had been displaced by backhoe excavation, but 50 cm is the estimated
diameter of the feature. At the same level in TU 2.1 another cluster of burned rock appears to be
partially exposed in the eastern wall of the unit (see Figure 8). Chipped stone materials from the
level of Feature 1 (Level 3) in TUs 2 and 2.1 include 8 biface thinning flakes, 5 core flakes, 1
core, and 4 pieces of shatter as well as 10 thermally fractured chert fragments (see Table 3).
Small amounts of burned bone and mussel shell were recovered in Level 3 as well. In addition,
the tip and midsection of one dart point was recovered in association with this feature in TU 2.
This piece is 3.25 cm in length, 1.55 cm in maximum width and .7 cm in thickness (Figure 10).
This point is composed of waxy medium brown Edwards Chert. Although in cross section the
edges are very straight, fine retouch is apparent creating a slightly more pronounced beveling of
this point. The mid-section break appears to be a “bending” fracture that may be the result of use
or impact (Frison and Bradley 1980, Lintz and Dockall 2002). The core recovered in TU 2 Level
3 is an amorphous expedient core of heat-discolored medium-grained limestone chert with agate
type swirling of pale gray and dark gray. The core measures 52-x-57-x-26 mm in maximum
dimension. A charcoal sample collected from the fill of Feature 1 yielded a date of 350 ±40 B.P.
(Beta – 215662). This date is consistent with the late Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric period
in south-Central Texas.
Materials recovered from the A horizon (0–34 cm bs) in TUs 2 and 2.1 including those associated
with Feature 1 consist of 45 biface thinning flakes, 14 core flakes, 2 cores, 18 pieces of shatter, 36
thermally fractured chert fragments, 7 mussel shells, the dart point tip discussed above, and one

unidentified animal tooth fragment (see Table 3). The second core recovered from this horizon is
a small exhausted core (20-x-42-x-32 mm) with eight apparent flakes removed from a tabular
chert cobble exhibiting cortex on two sides; this piece was recovered from TU 2 Level 2.
A clear division between components is located immediately below this feature, the base of
which is approximately 35 cm bs and situated directly on top of the boundary between the A and
Bk horizons. This feature was exposed and then mapped in place (see Figure 8). After these
materials were removed and collected, no other cultural materials were observed in a 6-cm-thick
lens below the feature. However, at 41 cm bs there was a marked increase in the recovery of
cultural materials. A 6-cm cultural void was therefore documented below the feature and
interpreted as a separation between two discrete cultural components.
The second component, located in the Bk horizon, appeared to extend from 41 to 56 cm bs with
sparse cultural materials tapering in frequency down to 86 cm (see Table 3 and Figure 7), likely
due to bioturbation. Materials recovered from this component in TUs 2 and 2.1 include roughly
50 fire-cracked rocks, two biface thinning flakes, five pieces of shatter, six pieces of thermally
fractured chert, and five mussel shells (see Table 3). Artifact density was lower in this
component than in the upper component within the A horizon, and no cultural features were
identified in these levels of TUs 2 and 2.1.

Test Unit 3
Test Unit 3 was a .5-x-.5-m unit placed 2.3 m west of Test Units 2 and 2.1 along BHT 10 (see
Figure 4). This unit was excavated to a maximum depth of 56 cm bs. The boundary between the
A horizon and Bk horizon was identified at 31 cm bs, 4 cm higher than in TUs 2 and 2.1. In this
unit, Levels 2 and 3 were excavated and bagged in 5-cm increments to increase resolution at these
depths and perhaps assist with interpretation (Figure 11). As was apparent in TUs 2 and 2.1,
though less marked, the 5-cm level just below the A/Bk boundary in this unit contained a
decrease in artifact frequency. The artifact density increased again at 5–6 cm below the
boundary, mirroring the separation of components that was apparent in TUs 2 and 2.1. Cultural
materials recovered from the A horizon levels of TU 3 include 31 fire-cracked rocks, 25 biface
thinning flakes, nine core flakes, 12 pieces of shatter, one core, seven pieces of thermally
fractured chert, one burned bone fragment, five mussel shells, and two bits of baked clay (see
Table 3). The core is a smoothed reddish brown river cobble measuring 72-x-55-x-35 mm in
maximum dimension with a slightly banded pale gray pink interior. It is amorphous/expedient
with nine apparent flake removals and heat discoloration. Materials recovered from within the
Bk horizon in TU 3 include five fire-cracked rocks, six biface thinning flakes, three core flakes,
four pieces of shatter, 11 pieces of thermally fractured chert, two mussel shells, and three piece of
baked clay (see Table 3).
When artifact frequency for Test Unit 3 is graphed showing the 5-cm separation of both Levels 2
and 3, there appears to be a concentration of artifacts within the upper approximately 21 cm
followed by a decrease in frequency (see Figure 11a). Artifact frequency then increases again
above the A/Bk horizon where the Feature 1 occupation surface was identified in TU 2. When
the upper and lower portions of Level 2 are combined however (see Figure 11b), the graph of
artifact frequencies for this unit appears much more similar to those for TUs 2 and 2.1. Because
the graph on the left (see Figure 11a) indicates a slight decrease in artifacts occurring near the
modern ground surface and artifacts lying on the occupation surface belonging to Feature 1 at the

base of the A horizon, any additional work in this portion of the site should perhaps be conducted
in such a manner that excavators would be able to recognize a possible thin separation between
two components in the A horizon.
To summarize test excavations adjacent to BHT 10, the occupation surface that Feature 1,
identified in TUs 2 and 2.1, sits atop is located just above the A/Bk boundary. This boundary is
located at approximately 35 cm bs in TUs 2 and 2.1 and undulated to 31 cm bs in TU 3, located
2.3 m away from the feature. The occupation surface identified in TUs 2 and 2.1 is therefore by
extension located at 31 cm bs in TU 3 where there is a notable paucity of burned rock and a
significant increase in chipped stone debris. There is 72 percent more chipped stone by volume
in this unit than in TU 2. A contrast between functional areas across the living surface within this
component is inferred based on the shift in the artifact assemblage composition across a 2.3-m
horizontal separation. In this case, the two distinct areas may be representative of cooking
associated with Feature 1 and tool production and tool maintenance associated with food
preparation or other activities occurring in the location of TU 3. Additional investigation at this
site should include larger blocks of excavation so that activity areas and their peripheries can be
resolved horizontally across portions of this site.

Backhoe Trench 14
Backhoe Trench 14 (BHT14) began at the tree line and extended southeast along the centerline of
the marked pipeline easement at 150º (see Figure 4). This trench was 10.5 m (34.5 ft) long and
excavated to a maximum depth of roughly 3.7 m (12 ft). Backhoe Trench 14 contained a very
similar profile to that exposed in BHT 10. Soils in BHT 14 exhibited an A-Bk-Btk-2Btk horizon
sequence that extended from the surface to the maximum depth of 3.72 m (Figure 12). Cultural
materials were concentrated in the A and Bk horizons and again appeared to represent a minimum
of two cultural components. The A horizon (silty loam, 10YR 3/2 wet) was a maximum of .38 m
thick and characterized by weak medium subangular blocky structure. During the excavation of
BHT 14, artifacts were observed in the upper generally 10 cm of the A horizon, and also in the
lower roughly 10 cm of the horizon, at the contact with the underlying Bk. The Bk (silty clay
loam, 10YR 3/3 wet) was extant from a minimum depth of 0.26–0.38 m down to a maximum
depth of 1.10 m below the surface and contained Stage I carbonate filaments (see Appendix A).
Cultural material was observed between 0.45 and 0.55 m in the Bk horizon. The Btk horizon
(silty clay, 10YR 4/3 wet) had a maximum thickness of 0.80 m and was characterized by
moderate medium angular structure (see Appendix A). The basal 2Btk horizon (clay, 10YR 4/4
wet) marks the same lithic discontinuity evident in the lower portion of BHT 10. This unit
contained one lithic core located at approximately 1.6 m bs. Soil structure in the 2Btk horizon
was moderate medium columnar breaking to moderate medium angular blocky (see Appendix A).

One large fragment of ground stone was recovered during backhoe excavation of BHT 14. This
is the only large flat rock recovered during fieldwork at this site. This piece measures
approximately 24-x-17 cm in size and 5.2 cm in thickness and was likely used for a short period
as a metate. Smoothing on the outer margins of this piece indicates that it was originally water
worn and likely brought to the site for use from the river below. Also during excavation of the
42

trench, one large bison bone was recovered while sediment was being removed from the bottom
of the trench. Excavation was temporarily halted while its origin was determined. The walls of
the trench were scraped and additional bone was identified at approximately 47 cm bs in the
southern trench wall 6 m from the east end of the trench. Two adjacent 1-x-.5-m test units were
placed over the bone in the southern wall. Test Units 4 and 5 were placed 4.5 m and 5.5 m away
from the eastern end of BHT14, respectively. The results of these hand excavations will be
discussed below. Analysis of the bison bone resulted in its identification as a proximal tibia with
a spiral fracture potentially indicative of marrow extraction (Appendix B).
A bench for careful analysis and recording of the trench profile was excavated adjacent to BHT
14. During excavation of the bench, a small concentration of burned rocks was encountered near
the eastern end of the trench. The remains of this rock concentration were left in place and the
bench location was shifted to the west. The surface of the bench when excavation was halted was
at approximately 25 cm bs. The rock concentration, hypothesized to be a disarticulated burned
rock feature, was the focus of Test Unit 1.

Test Unit 1
The small rock feature (Feature 2) identified during bench excavation consisted of more than 23
burned or fire-cracked limestone and sandstone rocks of 2–20 cm in size. This concentration was
truncated by BHT 14 on its southern side but was approximately 40 cm in maximum diameter
and lying on a horizontal plane at 28–29 cm bs (Figure 13). The loose backdirt from excavation
of this bench was screened before careful excavation was begun. TU 1 was laid out as a 1-x-1-m
unit above the rock concentration and was excavated to a depth of 63 cm bs. If the rock identified
during trench excavation was indeed a hearth feature or heating element, it had been too badly
disarticulated to be identifiable as anything but a burned rock cluster during test unit excavation.
Cultural materials identified in Level 1 (26–34 cm bs) were likely associated with the small rock
feature. These materials included a cluster of seven large (> 9 cm) and 16 smaller fire-cracked
rock, nine biface thinning flakes, two fragments of thermally fractured chert, and one core (see
Table 3). This feature is located at the base of the A horizon and is believed to represent the same
cultural component and occupation surface as that observed at the base of the A horizon 6–8 m
away in TUs 2 and 2.1. A small amount of charcoal was recovered from Feature 2, though no
staining or ash was observed.
Test Unit 1 as a whole yielded a total of 18 chipped stone artifacts—one core, one heavily
reworked dart point, two pieces of shatter, two pieces of heat-fractured chert, and 11 biface
manufacturing flakes (see Table 3). The dart point was recovered from Level 3 (44–53 cm bs),
the same level from which the bison bone was recovered within this trench. This point appears to
be an Ensor-Fairland variety dart point, roughly dating to the Late/Transitional Archaic period
(Turner and Hester 1999) (Figure 14). It is heavily reworked and measures 2.2 cm in maximum
length, 1.85 cm in maximum width, and .5 cm in thickness. This point was apparently reworked
and resharpened repeatedly while still in the haft and then finally discarded. Below 53 cm the
frequency of artifacts dropped significantly (Figure 15).

Test Units 4 and 5
Test Units 4 and 5 were placed over two fragments of bone observed protruding from the
southern wall of BHT 14. These adjacent units were each 1-x-.5 m and were set back from the
trench 20 cm for safety and to prevent large portions of the unit from slumping into BHT 14. In
order to investigate the shallow deposits as well as the bone, noted at approximately 47 cm bs,
TUs 4 and 5 were excavated to a minimum depth of 66 cm bs. In the western half of BHT 14, the
boundary between the A and Bk horizon is approximately 26–30 cm bs, several centimeters
higher than that observed in BHT 10 (see Figures 5 and 12).
Materials recovered in the A horizon of BHT 14 in TUs 4 and 5 include small burned rock
fragments, eight biface thinning flakes, two core flakes, five pieces of shatter, one edge modified
flake, two pieces of thermally fractured chert, one pottery sherd, four pieces of mussel shell, and
24 small bone fragments (see Table 3). The edge modified flake from TU 4 Level 1 is a large
core flake of undifferentiated chert with a few small flakes removed from the lateral edge creating
a steep bevel. The only identifiable bone found within this component is a rib fragment of a
possible deer or deer-sized mammal (Appendix B). The only sherd of prehistoric pottery
identified from this site was recovered from TU 4 Level 2 (6–16 cm bs) (Figure 16). This piece
has buff-colored paste with a smooth surface and oxidized interior and temper containing burned
bone as well as a few well-rounded quartz sand grains. This pottery sherd measures 2.35-x-1.9
cm and .6 cm in thickness. This type of ware has been recovered from mission contexts as well
as prehistoric or Protohistoric aboriginal contexts in South Texas and indicates that a Late
Prehistoric or Protohistoric component may be present in the A horizon at this site. This pottery
corresponds well with the Late Prehistoric date recovered from Feature 1 in TU 2.

Materials found in the upper part of the Bk horizon in TUs 4 and 5 are equivalent to those
identified in the same stratigraphic position 8–10 m away in the BHT 10 test units (TUs 2, 2.1,
and 3). In Test Units 4 and 5, these materials include the animal bone observed during trench
excavation. Bone was observed during excavation in small broken fragments from 26–40 cm bs;
at the base of Level 5 (36–46 cm bs); however, several larger bones were mapped in place as
46

potentially deposited (Figures 17 and 18). Faunal analysis resulted in the identification of these
specimens as bison rib bone fragments (Appendix B). Also one bison long bone shaft fragment
exhibiting a green break was recovered from Level 4 (26–36 cm bs). Additional faunal
specimens identified from this Bk horizon component in TUs 4 and 5 include white-tailed deer,
eastern cottontail rabbit, and snake. The amount of bone recovered from each level is
summarized in Table 3 and the faunal analysis is presented in Appendix B. Animal bone was
recovered in greater quantity from TU 4 than TU 5, as was chipped stone. Charcoal collected
from the fill surrounding the bison rib fragments in Level 5 yielded a date of 850 ± 40 B.P. (Beta
– 215663). This date is consistent with the early, Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric when bison
were less prevalent on the southern plains than in the preceding or succeeding periods.
Other materials recovered from the Bk horizon component of TUs 4 and 5 include six biface
thinning flakes, two core flakes, six pieces of shatter, two mussel shells, and two edge-modified
flakes. The two unifacially edge modified flakes were recovered from TU 5 Level 6 (see Table
3). One is a distal fragment of a laterally edge modified flake of Edwards chert, and the other is
an edge modified flake of undifferentiated chert with modification also on the lateral edge and
cortex remaining on the distal and proximal ends. Burned rock, bone fragments, and chipped
stone were recovered down to 66 cm (Figure 19). During excavation, the vertical distribution of
the smaller faunal material gave the impression of a certain degree of movement of materials
within the profile and that all could likely be “migrated” back to between 36–46 cm bs (Level 5).
Test Unit 5 was excavated to 76 cm bs and then, in order to investigate materials identified in the
trench wall at 160 cm bs, it was extended to a depth of 166 cm bs. This was done by removing
the overburden from 77–146 cm bs and then resuming controlled excavation at 146 cm bs. Two
levels were excavated and screened. In these levels, no cultural materials or features were
recovered or observed with the exception of the one large chert core that was originally observed
in the trench profile. This core measures 70-x-52 mm in maximum dimension and is a battered
fossiliferous chert cobble with crystalline imperfections throughout and 40 percent remaining
cortex. The cultural component observed at 160 cm bs, therefore, is considered very sparse and,
in this immediate locality, little research value can be gleaned.
To sum up the excavations conducted adjacent to BHT 14, the disarticulated Feature 2 in Level 1
of TU 1 is located on the same living surface as Feature 1 identified in TUs 2 and 2.1 in BHT 10.
Below the burned rock Feature 2 at the base of the A horizon in TU 1, artifact density again
dropped substantially indicating the separation between the lower A horizon and Bk horizon
components. The materials identified in the lower levels of TU 1 in the Bk horizon, including the
diagnostic Late Archaic dart point, were at the same relative depth as the bison bone exposed in
TU 4 and the Bk horizon component identified in the test units adjacent to BHT 10 (Figure 20).
The dart point identified was, therefore, considered to be associated with the component
containing bison bone in TUs 4 and 5. The radiocarbon date of 850 ±40 B.P. associated with the
bison bone, however, indicates that this component dates to the early Late Prehistoric. It is
possible that this cultural level remained stable for a significant period of time resulting in
deposition of cultural materials over a long period of time. Alternatively, the Late/Transitional
Archaic dart point recovered from TU 1 may represent a curated item; this piece is highly
reworked.
A correlation is drawn between the lower cultural component present in the Bk horizon of BHT
14 and that in BHT 10. This spatial correlation likely extends throughout the remaining
undisturbed portion of this site and certainly throughout the wooded portion of the pipeline

corridor located on the terrace tread. A strong correlation between BHTs 10 and 14 also exists
with regard to the occupation surface identified at the base of the A horizon. This surface appears
to be continuous across the site and contains multiple features that, given further study and
interpretation, could elucidate activity patterning and intra-site spatial relationships at site
41BX1623.

Backhoe Trench 13
Backhoe Trench 13 (BHT 13) was excavated at the terrace margin. The western end of this
trench is on or near the terrace tread surface; from there, the terrace slopes away to the east. A
barbed wire fence and gate cross the western end of this trench. Two pieces of fire-cracked rock
and one fragment of mussel shell were all that was seen during trench excavation and profiling.
Approximately 20–30 cm of the upper portion of the slope in this trench had been bladed away
during preparation of a dirt road bed that extends down from the terrace to the pipeline
interconnect below.
Backhoe Trench 13 reached a maximum depth of 4.0 m (13 ft), a maximum length of 8 m
(24.2 ft), and contained A/Bk, Bk, 2Btk1, 2Btk2 horizons. These again reflect sediment
deposition by overbank flooding (Figure 21). The partially bladed A/Bk horizon (silty loam,
10YR 3/2 wet) had a maximum thickness of .40 m and exhibited weak medium subangular
blocky structure (see Appendix A). The A horizon was associated with two pieces of fire-cracked
rock that were visible in the south wall of the trench (see Figure 21). The Bk horizon consisted of
silty clay loam (10YR 3/2 wet) with subangular blocky structure and early Stage I carbonate
filaments and threads (see Appendix A). The .60-m-thick horizon was underlain by a thick,

massive bed of clayey silt that extended from approximately 1.0 to 4.0 m below the surface (see
Figure 21). This deposit represents a 2Btk horizon that was subdivided into two subhorizons on
the basis of color and carbonate content (see Appendix A). No cultural materials were observed
in the 2Btk.
A lens of charcoal, ash, and burned earth was observed in the south wall at about 2.7 m and
3.76 m below the terrace tread surface. Though no artifacts were observed in the trench near this
feature, its shape, size, and composition strongly suggested a possible hearth feature. A bench
was excavated adjacent to BHT 13 so that this feature could be tested (Figure 22). A profile of
this feature was drawn prior to excavation of Test Unit 6 (Figure 23). Approximately 2.3 m of
overburden were removed so that a 1-x-1-m test unit could be placed over the thermal feature.
Additional overburden was removed by hand and selectively screened. A secondary datum was
placed on the bench adjacent to the excavation unit. Level 1 of TU 6 was excavated from 40–50
cm below the secondary datum (bd); Level 2 continued to 60 cm bd. No cultural materials were
recovered from this unit. Though this thermal feature appeared basin-shaped and cultural in
profile, in plan it had a discontinuous irregular shape. This is considered a natural feature and no
further work in this area was conducted.

Backhoe Trench 11
Backhoe Trench 11 (BHT 11) was excavated near the far eastern end of the project area where
the new corridor alignment enters the old pipeline right-of-way at the interconnect station. No
cultural materials were recovered in this trench. BHT 11 reached a maximum depth of roughly
3.9 m and contained a Bk-2Bt-3Bt profile (Figure 24). The trench was located in a road cut and
the former A horizon was missing. The Bk horizon (silty clay loam, 10YR 3/3 wet) extended
from the current surface to .45 m bs and was characterized by weak medium subangular blocky
structure (see Appendix A). The Bk was underlain by a 2Bt-3Bt soil (clayey silt, 10YR 4/4 wet)
that appeared to have been disturbed by a previous tree-throw event (see Figure 24). This
isevident by the shape and generally abrupt irregular nature of the 2Bt lower boundary (see
Figure 24). In addition, the 2Bt and 3Bt horizons were separated by two discontinuous silt
drapes, which were likely deposited during the final stages of individual flood episodes (cf.
Brakenridge 1987). No cultural materials were encountered in BHT 11.

Backhoe Trench 12
Backhoe Trench 12 (BHT 12) was excavated west of BHT 11 and placed above the road cut that
a portion of the easement centerline follows so that the trench was excavated from the surface of
the terrace slope rather than the bladed road. No cultural materials were identified in this trench.
Backhoe Trench 12 contained four soil horizons distributed from the surface to a depth of 3.9 m.
As illustrated in Figure 25, the trench soils were arranged in an A-Bk-Btk-2Btk profile sequence
composed of fine-grained overbank sediments (see Appendix A). These soils extended
throughout the entire length of the profile; however, the depth of the trench, together with
abundant tree roots and the loose nature of the sediments, precluded actual profile drawing of the

entire trench wall. The A horizon (silty loam, 10YR 3/2 wet) extended from the surface to .38 m
bs, while the Bk horizon (silty clay loam, 10YR 3/3 wet) extended from .38 to 1.25 m bs (see
Figure 25). The Bk horizon contained Stage I carbonates (filaments). The Btk horizon (clay
loam, 10YR 4/2 wet) had a maximum thickness of .38 m and was characterized by moderate
medium subangular blocky structure and early Stage I filaments (see Appendix A). This horizon
was underlain by a 2Btk horizon (silty clay, 10YR 5/2 wet) that was extant from roughly 1.63 m
bs to the bottom of the trench at 3.9 m (see Figure 25). No artifacts were observed during the
excavation and examination of Backhoe Trench 12.
Backhoe Trench 15
The third terrace tread backhoe trench was located in the plowed portion of the site (Figure 26).
Backhoe Trench 15 (BHT 15) was excavated approximately 30 m west of the tree line. This
trench was 10.1 m (33 ft) long, 3.96 m (13 ft) deep and oriented approximately 90º. The purpose
of this trench was to determine if deeply buried materials were present west of the tree line that
could impede potential plans to bore the pipeline below the site.

The soils in this trench exhibited an Ap-Bk-Btk-2Bt horizon profile (Figure 27). These sediments
were deposited in overbank, and possibly backswamp, sedimentary environments. The Ap
horizon (silty clay loam, 10YR 3/2 wet) is the modern plowzone that extended from the surface to
.60 m bs. The disturbed horizon had weak medium columnar structure. The Bk horizon (silty
clay loam, 10YR 3/3 wet) had a maximum thickness of .30 m and contained early Stage I
carbonate filaments (see Appendix A). The underlying Btk horizon (clay, 10YR 4/2 wet) also
contained early Stage I filaments and had a maximum thickness of .80 m (see Figure 27). This
horizon was underlain by a 2Bt horizon (silty clay, 10YR 5/4 wet) that extended from
approximately 1.7 to 3.9 m bs. This horizon appeared genetically similar to the 2Btk horizons
exposed in the lower portions of BHTs 10 and 14 (see Figures 5 and 12; see Appendix A).
Although artifacts were observed on the site surface in the general vicinity of BHT 15, none were
encountered during the backhoe trenching. This situation, and the six original trenches excavated
during the initial site discovery, suggests that potentially significant, buried cultural resources are
not likely to be extant in the plowed portion of the site.

SITE SUMMARY
Archeological investigations at site 41BX1623 focused on defining the nature and presence of
cultural materials within the revised SAWS pipeline corridor as well as providing an evaluation
of the site’s eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. Six controlled archeological test units were
excavated adjacent to three backhoe trenches (BHTs 10, 13 and 14) within the site boundary and
proposed corridor. Geoarcheological investigations were integrated with traditional archeological
methods to assess the pedogenic and stratigraphic context of buried cultural materials through the
excavation of six backhoe trenches located along the right-of-way of a proposed wastewater
pipeline.

A minimum of two cultural components were identified during excavation. The upper
component is located within the A horizon and includes cultural features preserved on the buried
living surface located at the base of the A horizon, just above the A/Bk horizon boundary
(approximately 34 cm bs). This component appears to date to the late Toyah phase of the Late
Prehistoric period of south-Central Texas. Materials recovered within this component include
clusters of burned rock, one fragmentary projectile point, one prehistoric pottery sherd, chipped
stone debitage, and sparse amounts of bone, charcoal, and mussel shell. The lower component is
located within the Bk horizon at approximately 41 cm bs. Materials identified within this
component include one Ensor/Fairland Late Archaic dart point, chipped stone debitage, and
smaller amounts of burned rock and mussel shell, as well as a variety of animal bone including
bison and white-tailed deer. One radiocarbon date from this component places it within the early
Late Prehistoric period. At 160 cm bs, sparse evidence for an additional cultural component was
encountered in BHTs 10 and 14. This component was signaled by the presence of one chert core
in BHT 14 and burned rock in the wall of BHT 10.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Archeological investigations at site 41BX1623 focused on determining the presence of cultural
materials within the revised SAWS pipeline corridor as well as evaluating the eligibility of the
site for inclusion in the NRHP. Six backhoe trenches and six controlled test units were excavated
during fieldwork to provide data archeological data to support an evaluation of eligibility.
ELIGIBILITY EVALUATIONS
The preliminary evaluation of the cultural resources discussed in this report was based on the
criteria presented in 36 CFR § 60.4 (a–d), which provides the guidelines used to determine a
site’s eligibility for inclusion in the National Register:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR § 60.4].

In order for a site to be eligible for inclusion in the National Register, it must meet legal standards
of eligibility. Three requirements determine these standards: (1) properties must possess
significance; (2) the significance must satisfy at least one of the above four criteria for eligibility;
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. Historic
context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history according to
periods of development in various times and places. Thus, the significance of a site can best be
understood through knowledge of historic development and the relationship of the site to other
similar sites within a particular period of development. Most prehistoric sites are only eligible for
inclusion in the National Register under Criterion D, which considers their potential to provide
data important to understanding prehistoric adaptations in a region.

SITE DISCUSSION AND SIGNIFICANCE EVALUATION
Site 41BX1623 is located on an elevated terrace above the San Antonio River. The confluence of
the Medina River is 1.5 mi to the south. This well-watered environment southeast of the
Balcones Escarpment supports stands of hardwoods and has prehistorically and historically
supported abundant game. Site 41BX1623 is located in one of many such attractive places on the
landscape of Central Texas. Prehistoric use of this area by hunter-gatherers for occupation and
resource procurement is demonstrated by such nearby sites as the Richard Beene site and site
41BX859 (Thoms 2004, Thoms and Mandel 2005). Site 41BX1623 exhibits all of the attractive
qualities of place that these significant sites present.

Geoarcheological Summary
The terrace that site 41BX1623 is situated upon appears temporally and geomorphically
analogous to the Applewhite terrace as defined in the nearby Medina River valley by Thoms
(2001) and Thoms and Mandel (2005). The bulk of the Applewhite terrace sediments were
deposited between ca. 15,000 and 750 yr B.P. under a relatively low-energy vertical accretion
environment (Thoms 2001; Thoms and Mandel 2005:74). In the vicinity of the Richard Beene
archeological site southeast of San Antonio, Texas, the Applewhite terrace contains a number of
diagnostic late Pleistocene through middle–late Holocene paleosols and pedocomplexes (Thoms
and Mandel 2005:74). These buried soils were not evident in the terrace fill sediments at
41BX1623. This suggests that, while the terrace at 41BX1623 may be temporally analogous to
the Applewhite terrace, the two localities are pedologically disparate.
The trenches excavated at 41BX1623 share similar pedogenic and stratigraphic characteristics in
the upper roughly 1.75 m. In this portion of the terrace fill, soils are generally fine-grained (silty
loam, silty clay loam, silty clay) and contain an A-Bk-Btk horizon profile. Throughout the site
area, sediments in these horizons represent overbank flood deposits (cf. Allen 1970). These
deposits are associated with at least two cultural components: one in the A horizon and one in the
underlying Bk horizon. The association between archeological materials and these particular
horizons is strictly postdepositional as the horizon distinctions are the result of pedogenic
processes. Nevertheless, the observed components are vertically separated and the associated
soils are distinctive and easily identified (the A horizon characterized by high organic content,
dark color; the Bk horizon characterized by Stage I carbonate filaments and threads).
Variability across the site is evident in the soils extant below approximately 1.75 m of the surface.
Soils in this portion of the terrace fill have 2Btk or 2Bt-3Bt profiles and represent marked
changes in texture and color compared to the overlying horizons. In BHTs 10 and 14, on the
terrace tread, soil texture changes from brown silty clay in the Btk horizon to dark yellowish
brown clay in the 2Btk horizon. In BHT 15, the change is from dark grayish brown clay in the
Btk to yellowish brown silty clay in the 2Bt. Along the sloping margins of the terrace, the 2Btk
horizons reflect a significant increase in silt (versus clay in the Btk). Throughout the site area,
these differences in lithology appear to reflect variations in floodplain facies environments (i.e.,
floodplain overbank, backswamp, and possible upper point-bar settings). Of these environments,
archeological materials are most likely to be associated with the floodplain and point bar facies.

60

Finally, cultural components in the unplowed portions of site 41BX1623 appear relatively
undisturbed by natural and cultural site formation processes. The fine-grained nature of the site
sediments suggests that sediment deposition throughout the upper approximately 4.0 m of the
terrace fill occurred under generally low energy conditions—an environment, that in alluvial
floodplains, is known to be conducive to the preservation of systemic archeological context (cf.
Waters 1992:103). High-energy sediments, such as gravels or coarse sands, were not encountered
in any of the backhoe trenches. Once buried, archeological materials at the site could have been
subjected to various forms of bioturbation; however, impacts from these processes appear limited
by the aggradational nature of the terrace deposits. Because the Applewhite terrace is known to
have aggraded rather steadily, if not slowly, throughout the Holocene, impacts from bioturbation
that normally impact geomorphically stable landforms are not noticeably pronounced. This
includes rodent burrows, insect casts, and other characteristics of so-called active “biomantle”
settings (cf. Wood and Johnson 1978). All in all, these characteristics of natural site formation
enhance the apparent research potential of the site.

Cultural Components
A relatively small portion of site 41BX1623 remains intact because plowing within the adjacent
agricultural field impacted much of it. Archeological investigations, therefore, focused on the
segment of the SAWS pipeline corridor that is located within the wooded portion of the site.
Cultural materials were recorded from the terrace surface to a maximum depth of 160 cm. Within
this 160-cm package of sediments, a minimum of two cultural components are recognized, and
the possibility of a third is implied.
The upper component is located within the A horizon and exhibits cultural features and evidence
of preserved horizontal patterning of artifacts and activity loci including a burned rock feature
(Feature 1) and another burned rock cluster (Feature 2) that provide a stratigraphic reference for
the associated living surface. This prehistoric occupation surface lies directly on top of the
distinct A/Bk horizon boundary, indicating either a substantial period of stability or an erosional
unconformity that was followed by a period of stability during which this site was occupied and
cultural materials were deposited by the occupants. The tip and midsection of a probable dart
point was found associated with Feature 1. Other materials recovered within this component
include clusters of burned rock, one prehistoric pottery sherd, chipped stone debitage, and sparse
amounts of bone, charcoal, and mussel shell. One radiocarbon sample was submitted from
Feature 1 to determine the age of this component. This resulted in a date that is consistent with
the late Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric (350 ±40 B.P. [Beta – 215662]). Also in the A
horizon, one prehistoric pottery sherd was recovered in TU 4. The recovery of ceramics supports
the assignment of this component to the Toyah phase or Protohistoric period, when pottery
appeared and became prevalent in south Central Texas.
Approximately 6 cm of sediment separates the living surface at the base of the A horizon from
the second component located within the Bk horizon. This separation was particularly clear in
the test units located adjacent to BHT 10 (TUs 2, 2.1, and 3). The component identified in the Bk
horizon at approximately 41 cm bs exhibits an overall lower artifact density than that in the A
horizon and differs in assemblage characteristics. Materials identified within this component
include one dart point, chipped stone debitage, and smaller amounts of burned rock and mussel
shell. Also, faunal material recovered from this component demonstrates the exploitation of
bison, white-tailed deer, and eastern cottontail rabbit. The Ensor/Fairland dart point identified in
61

stratigraphic association with this component would seem to support a Late Archaic period date
for this site. One AMS date on charcoal recovered in association with the bison bone, however,
indicates an early Late Prehistoric date. This is interpreted as possibly indicating a relatively
stable surface where multiple occupations occurred over a significant period of time resulting in a
mixing of cultural materials representing each occupation. Alternatively, the Late/Transitional
Archaic dart point recovered from TU 1 may represent a curated item. This point is very
reworked and may have been recovered and used until it exceeded its point of utility.
The third possible component is sparse and located at approximately 156–166 cm bs. Burned
rock was observed at this depth in BHT 10, and one test unit (TU 5) in BHT 14 was excavated to
this depth to investigate a chert core identified in the trench profile. No cultural materials other
than the one chert core and burned rock were recovered from this possible component.

Subsistence and Technology
In the Bk horizon component at this site, bison, white-tailed deer, and eastern cottontail rabbit are
represented by faunal remains recovered from TUs 4 and 5 in BHT 14. The cottontail is
represented by one specimen only and would have offered less of a caloric return in relation to
the other species available during this occupation phase. The white-tailed deer is represented by
distal and mid-shaft limb elements (see Appendix B). Two of the bison bone specimens exhibit a
spiral fracture indicative of possible marrow extraction. Represented among the identifiable
bison elements are rib bones, long bones, as well as a scapula blade fragment, and vertebrum
fragment (see Appendix B). This component is dated to the early Late Prehistoric phase by one
AMS date on charcoal recovered in association with the bison bone in TU 4. One heavily
reworked Late/Transitional Archaic dart point (Ensor/Fairland stylistic tradition) was recovered
in TU 1 (BHT 14). While the Late Archaic period in Central Texas was one of a relative
abundance of bison with continued reliance on deer hunting (Collins 1998), the first half of the
Late Prehistoric period was a time when bison were relatively scarce.
Animal bone was also recovered in small amounts from Feature 1 and the corresponding depth in
Test Unit 3 (the lower A horizon component). Though unidentifiable to a particular taxon, the
bone recovered from Feature 1 was burned, supporting the interpretation of this feature as a
heating element or small cooking hearth.
The Late Archaic in Central Texas was a time of moderately mesic conditions when stream
valleys were aggrading. This was a period of net sedimentary deposition and as a result the
archeological record of the Late Archaic in this region is well represented. Subsistence
technologies such as hot rock cooking and earth ovens that developed and intensified during the
Middle Archaic continued into the Late Archaic. By this time bison were again relatively
abundant in the region. Although specialized hot rock cooking technology was likely developed
out of the need to exploit xerophytes, geophytes, and perhaps acorns that required intensive
baking or steaming during the xeric climate of the Middle Archaic, their continued use when
climatic conditions alleviated was adaptive to a wider variety of subsistence resources (Collins
1998; Peter 1982; Thoms and Mandel 2005). As a result, the use of hot rock cooking and the
formation of burned rock features continued through the Late Prehistoric period.

62

In comparison to other sites in the region, oven cooking does not appear to have played a
particularly significant role at site 41BX1623. Ethnographic accounts suggest that hot rock oven
cooking was used primarily to cook foods that required more than 24–36 hours of steaming or
baking (Thoms and Mandel 2005). Cooking for shorter periods may not have necessitated
substantial stone heating elements as it could be accomplished using coals alone. This may be the
case at 41BX1623 where many of the plants requiring longer roasting times were not present east
of the Edwards Plateau and were therefore not a component of the prehistoric diet or where
occupants simply chose to exploit other subsistence resources. The smaller type burned rock
features that are present at this site may be the result of open hearths, stone boiling mechanisms,
or smaller earth ovens, rather than the large earth ovens commonly studied in Central Texas.
Additional investigation of these features at 41BX1623 could provide evidence of their function.
Mussel shell is sparsely represented in both the A horizon and Bk horizon components. Riverine
resources such as mussel apparently played a minor role in the diet of people at this site during
each period of occupation. A small amount of the mussel shell was burned, and there is no
evidence of use wear on any of the collected pieces.
Forty-four percent of the chipped stone recovered during excavations at 41BX1623 was
composed of Edwards chert with the remaining being mostly Uvalde gravels and minor amounts
of chalcedonic cherts, jasper, and quartzite (see Appendix C). Much of the observed raw
materials were river cobbles, including tested cobbles and expedient amorphous cores. Twenty
percent of the debitage from this site exhibits apparent heat treatment, much of it only to the point
of discoloration. Heat-treatment of raw materials, mostly cobbles from the river, might have been
an activity conducted onsite. Sixty-four pieces of thermally fractured chert were recovered in
TUs 1, 2, 2.1, 3, and 5, but the greatest frequencies were from the A horizon levels of test units in
BHT 10 (see Appendix C).
Based on the representation of morphological categories within the chipped stone debitage class,
it is apparent that a variety of lithic technological activities and manufacturing stages are
represented. The five cores recovered from excavation contexts and the numerous cores observed
in the plowed field all appear to have been of cobbles from the river below, indicating expedient
use of locally available materials. The frequencies of shatter, core reduction flakes, and biface
thinning flakes containing cortex also indicate that early stages of lithic tool manufacturing were
taking place onsite. The relatively high percentage (62 percent) of biface thinning flakes
measuring less than 19 mm and lacking cortex indicates that later stages of lithic manufacture and
tool production were also occurring on site.
Across the site, the chipped stone recovered from the A horizon component(s) consisted of 56
percent biface thinning flakes, 19 percent core flakes, 21 percent shatter, 4 percent cores, and less
than 1 percent chipped stone tools. Chipped stone from the Bk horizon component consisted of
33 percent biface thinning flakes, 18 percent core flakes, 38 percent shatter, and 10 percent
chipped stone tools. The morphological categories of chipped stone debitage from the A and Bk
horizon components compare favorably. Characteristics distinguishing the assemblages include a
higher ratio of biface thinning flakes to core flakes (88:30) in the upper horizon as well as the
presence of cores and the lower percentage of tools. This indicates that in the A horizon
component, in addition to biface thinning activities, earlier stage lithic tool manufacture and
procurement activities were also taking place involving less final tool production and onsite use,
alteration, and discard of finished tools. Sixteen percent of the biface thinning flakes in the A
horizon retain cortex on the dorsal or platform surfaces.

63

The chipped stone assemblage from the Bk horizon consists also of a high biface thinning to core
flake ratio (13:7), though less pronounced, as well as an absence of cores and a higher percentage
of tools. This lower component assemblage may be more in keeping with Waddell’s (1995)
Lithic Manufacture II and Hunting/Maintenance activity sets where final tool production and
maintenance of hunting implements was occurring. The heavily reworked Ensor/Fairland dart
point that was recovered in TU 1 likely received its last episode of reworking while still in the
haft onsite and was discarded intentionally once it had passed the point of utility. Fifteen percent
of the biface thinning flakes, however, exhibit cortex on the dorsal or platform surface indicating
that earlier stage biface reduction was occurring at this site during this occupation period.
One large fragment of ground stone was recovered during backhoe excavation of BHT 14. This
is the only large flat rock recovered during fieldwork at this site. This piece is approximately 24x-17 cm in size is lightly ground primarily on one side.

Site Patterning
This site appears to preserve potentially informative patterns in the distribution of artifacts and
features. The occupation surface that Feature 1, identified in TUs 2 and 2.1, sits atop is located
just above the A/Bk boundary. In TU 3, 2.3 m to the west, the same occupation surface exhibits a
notable paucity of burned rock and a significant increase in chipped stone debris. There is 72
percent more chipped stone by volume in this unit than in TU 2. A contrast between functional
areas across the living surface within this component is inferred based on the shift in the artifact
assemblage composition across a 2.3-m horizontal separation. In this case, the two distinct areas
may be representative of cooking associated with Feature 1 and tool production and tool
maintenance associated with food preparation or other activities occurring in the location of TU
3. Based on the horizontal separation of functional areas that is apparent in TUs 2, 2.1, and 3, it
appears that additional research at this site has the potential to resolve spatially distinct activity
areas and provide information about spatial patterning of features and activities that occurred
across the site.

Recommendations
Site 41BX1623 is strongly recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, under Criterion D.
Within the wooded portion of this site on the terrace, cultural materials are present to a maximum
depth of 160 cm bs. The two positively identified stratified cultural deposits at this site, one
within the lower part of the A horizon and the other within the Bk horizon, both exhibit cultural
materials and associations that retain significant research value (Table 4). Datable organic
remains were recovered in both components and in association with cultural features in the upper
component. Horizontal patterning of artifacts and features are preserved across the A horizon
prehistoric living surface. This preservation of spatial patterning of cultural activities provides
the opportunity to study site organization and land use. In addition, the recovery of a diagnostic
stone projectile point indicates the potential to address, with further study, the relationship
between site chronology and lithic hunting technology. The presence of finished diagnostic tools
and the variety of lithic manufacturing debris indicate that the lithic technology research domain
can also be addressed by further study at this site. The preservation of a faunal assemblage within
the Bk horizon component at this site as well as the recovery of small amounts of burned bone
from the upper component will provide the opportunity for the analysis of subsistence-related

activities during each time period represented (see Table 4). The recommendation that this site be
considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP is based on the preservation of two distinct datable
components retaining a relatively high degree of contextual integrity and the potential to address
a number of regional cultural research issues.
Current plans for the excavation of a sewer pipeline within the corridor investigated during the
course of this study would adversely impact these significant cultural resources. Such impacts
may be mitigated through avoidance (selection of another route), boring beneath the site, or data
recovery. Of these, only boring or data recovery are presently viable options for SAWS. Boring
under the site in order to place the sewer pipe below the culturally significant deposits appears to
mitigate the issue of site preservation for the time being. It is of some concern, however, that in
the event of a pipeline break or leak, emergency circumstances would necessitate the excavation
of a deep, wide pit through the site matrix to facilitate repair of the pipeline. In the interest of site
preservation, this option is not preferred. Data recovery would involve additional archeological
investigation within the pipeline corridor for the recovery of significant cultural data that would
otherwise be lost if pipeline excavation occurs within the present corridor.
65

If data recovery is chosen, additional work at this site should include block excavations large
enough that horizontal patterning of features and artifacts would be discernable within each of the
components identified in the upper 80 cm of the site. Excavations should focus only on the
terrace tread surface within the wooded portion of the site. Controlled excavation should be
conducted so that fine separations between components or density variations will be recognized.
Block excavations should extend to a maximum depth of 80 cm bs and no more than four
excavation units should sample the possible component present at 160 cm bs. This component
was signaled by the presence of one chert core in BHT 14 and burned rock in the wall of BHT 10.
The horizontal patterning of artifacts as well as features at this site and the associations of artifact
classes will provide information about the organization of activities and land use on the terrace
surface. The technological research domain may be further addressed through the investigation
of the living surface associated with the A horizon component. The horizontal patterning of
chipped stone debris may clarify the lithic manufacturing activities that took place at different
locations across the site. In addition to information about intrasite spatial patterning, lithic
technology, and subsistence, additional data acquisition at this site may provide the opportunity to
address research questions related to regional networks, mobility, and transmission of cultural
identity. Assemblage compositions as well as the spatial patterning of activities related to artifact
manufacture, usage, and discard may become potential sources of data that relate information
about ethnic identity in the absence of the more highly stylistic artifact classes (such as
sophisticated pottery, textiles, and ornamentation) that are typically imbued with signifiers of
ethnic identity.
Additional work at this site would also yield datable materials from contexts that will provide
chronological information. Supplementary dates will help fine tune the chronology of this site
and the features identified as well as allow comparison to regional chronological and climatic
data.
Subsistence questions can be addressed at this site by additional work producing samples from
features for flotation and perhaps the recovery of macrobotanical remains. Charred plant remains
recovered from cooking feature contexts, such as Feature 1, could yield supporting paleodietary
information. Also, further investigation of the types of burned rock features present and their
morphology supplemented by botanical data could provide evidence for the methods of hot rock
cookery employed at this site. Additional fieldwork resulting in the collection of macrobotanical
remains and charred plant material could provide evidence that would point to the specific
function that ground stone might have had at this site.
In summary, additional work at this site should include block excavations near TUs 2, 2.1, and 4
that are large enough (perhaps 3-x-3 m²) for horizontal patterning of features and artifacts to be
discerned within each of the components identified in the upper 80 cm of the site. Excavations
should focus primarily on the terrace tread surface within the wooded portion of the site.
Controlled excavation should be conducted in 5- or 10-cm arbitrary levels within stratigraphic
levels to provide the type of horizontal and vertical control that would ensure that fine separations
between components or density variations will be recognized. Block excavations should extend
to a maximum depth of 80 cm bs. Select 1-x-1-m excavations should test the sparse component
that may be present at 160 cm bs.

ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
OF THE SITE 41BX1623 ARCHAEOFAUNA

Program in Environmental Science

INTRODUCTION
The 41BX1623 archaeofauna produced only a small amount of faunal material primarily
consisting of highly fragmented mammal remains; fifty-three percent of the fragments are
unidentifiable to taxon or element (Table B-1). There is a signature of Bison bison at the site, and
a few other taxa are represented including cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus), white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and snakes (Serpentes) (see Table B-1). This report briefly
discusses the systematic paleontology of the fauna, which describes criteria used in identification.
A short discussion of taphonomy of the fauna is also covered; no attention is devoted to site
interpretation given the small size of the fauna and its poor taphonomic condition. Specimens are
counted using two quantitative units NSP (number of specimens) and NISP (number of identified
specimens) (Lyman 1994a). Because samples are small, MNIs (minimum number of individuals)
are not calculated. Most remains from the sample are highly fragmented and cannot be identified
to taxon or element. A complete record of faunal specimen identifications is summarized in
Table B-1.

SYSTEMATIC PALEONTOLOGY
Specimens are assigned to class, order, suborder, family, genus, and species according to their
identifiability. Size classes (e.g., “deer size”) are used to describe remains that bear no diagnostic
features but are similar in size and shape to portions from a particular element from a species. If
a specimen is very close in shape and size to an element of a particular taxon but bereft of reliable
diagnostic features, then the identification is provided on a comparative basis, for example as cf.
Crotalus atrox, which means “compares favorably with western diamondback rattlensnake.”
Other snake remains are not identified beyond suborder Serpentes. Given the low density of
elements from the axial skeleton and the taxonomic overlap in morphological characteristics of
rib fragments in particular, several fragments are considered “unidentified.” When identifications
of such elements are possible, they are offered in terms of size class (e.g., Bison size), which is a
conservative approach.
B-3

Phylum Chordata (chordates)
Class Mammalia (mammals)
Order Artiodactyla (even-hooved animals)
Family Bovidae (antelopes, cattle, gazelles, goats, sheep, and relatives)
Bison bison (American Bison)
NISP: 1 proximal tibia fragment. Total NISP = 1
Bison size (compares in size to Bison bison)
NISP: 1 scapula blade fragment, 1 long-bone shaft fragments, 51 rib fragments, 3 vertebra
fragments. Total NISP = 56
Remarks: These specimens were identified in comparison to modern comparative specimens.
Bison bison occurred sporadically throughout portions of the state, including central and south
Texas (Collins 2004; Hester 2004), during periods of the Holocene. Non-diagnostic fragments,
such as from ribs, vertebra, and long-bone midshafts, are identified primarily according to size
and thickness of bone. However, there is one case (Test Unit 4, Level 5) in which several small
fragments were found in anatomically correct association with larger identifiable rib fragments.
The small specimens would not normally be identifiable to element or taxon, but they were here
because of that association. The proximal tibia was fragmented when it was fresh exhibiting
longitudinal and slight spiral fracture patterns (after Lyman 1994b). From a biogeographic
perspective, this site is important because it offers additional evidence as to the Holocene
distribution of Bison bison in Texas.
Family Cervidae (deer, elk, and relatives)
Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer)
NISP: 1 lunar (carpal) fragment, 1 distal fibula fragment, 1 distal 1st phalanx. Total NISP = 3
Deer size (compares in size to white-tailed deer)
NISP = 9 rib fragments, 1 long-bone midshaft fragment. Total NISP = 10
Remarks: These specimens were identified in comparison to modern comparative specimens and
according to criteria outlined by Lawrence (1951). White-tailed deer are common during the
Holocene in Texas (see references in Perttula 2004), and though mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus) have occurred in the state, their historic distribution is farther west (Schmidly 1994).
Further, white-tailed deer tend to be slightly smaller than mule deer (though there is overlap).
The specimens from 41BX1623 compare in size quite favorably to small white-tailed deer. Rib
fragments and long-bone midhshafts are not diagnostic and were assigned to “deer size” as a
result. The carpal, distal fibula, and first phalanx overlap closely with modern O. virginianus.
White-tailed deer represent the largest-bodied, consistently available prey to humans in eastern
North America during most of the Holocene⎯ranging between 22.5 and 180 kg. Elk (Cervus
elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) were also available in areas of the eastern woodlands, the midsouth, and the Midwest (e.g., Wolverton 2002a). However, white-tailed deer were extremely
important prey because their range extends across all of eastern North America and they thrive in
many kinds of habitat (Hall 1981; Hamilton and Whitaker 1979; Smith 1991). Further, it is well
documented that deer were heavily hunted by prehistoric humans and that this taxon was an
extremely important source of protein during much of the Holocene, especially during the late
Holocene (e.g., Wolverton 2005).

Order Lagomorpha
Order Lagomorpha (hares, rabbits, and pikas)
Family Leporidae (rabbits and hares)
Sylvilagus floridanus (the eastern cottontail)
NISP = 1 proximal tibia epiphysis. Total NISP = 1
Remarks: This specimen was identified through comparison to modern specimens. Although
diagnostic post-cranial characteristics of jackrabbits (Lepus sp.) and swamp rabbits (Sylvilagus
aquaticus) are similar to those of the eastern cottontail (S. floridanus) and the marsh rabbit (S.
palustris), the latter two species tend to be much smaller in body size. The range of S. palustris
includes the southeastern United States, but its range during the historic period is east of
Louisiana (Hall 1981). In contrast, the range of the eastern cottontail extends through much of
eastern North America. Based on size and modern ranges, the proximal tibia specimen is
assigned to S. floridanus. The eastern cottontail tolerates a diverse array of habitats but generally
prefers brushy areas along timbered edges, which includes river and stream corridors (Jones et al.
1985). Relative to many other prey taxa (e.g., white tailed deer [Odocoileus virginianus] and
turkey [M. gallopavo]), the cottontail would have offered relatively low returns in that their body
size is small. However, trapping and/or netting technologies substantially decrease the cost of
acquiring rabbits, which increases their net caloric return rate to humans.
Class Reptilia (reptiles)
Order Squamata (lizards and snakes)
Suborder Serpentes (snakes)
NISP: 1 vertebra. Total NISP = 1
Family Vipiridae (pit vipers and vipers
cf. Crotalus atrox (compares in size to western diamondback rattlesnake)
NISP: 1 vertebra. Total NISP = 1
Remarks: Western diamondback rattlesnakes occur in the western part of Texas and this
specimen is from the easternmost limit of their range (Dixon 1987). The specimen was identified
using photos from Olsen (1968) in that no modern comparative specimens were available on short
notice. The cf. Crotalus atrox vertebra is relatively large and comes from a large snake, i.e., this
identification is based primarily on size. The other vertebra is from a smaller snake, the species
of which could not be accurately determined. These specimens may represent dietary remains but
are equally as likely the result of natural deposition.

TAPHONOMY
Most of the 41BX1623 fauna is highly fragmented as a result of substantial weathering that has
occurred since deposition. Further, any ungulate long-bones were likely to be fractured in order
to extract marrow, such as appears to be the case with the Bison tibia. The white-tailed deer first
phalanx also contains marrow in small quantity, but the weathered condition of the specimen
from 41BX1623 makes it difficult to determine if the marrow cavity was fractured when the bone
was fresh. Three unidentified specimens are partially or fully carbonized, which indicates low
temperature burning (Lyman 1994b). Since the assemblage is highly fragmented, no quantitative
attempt to gauge the intensity of fragmentation is made in this analysis (sensu Lyman 1994b;
Wolverton 2002b). There are no stone-tool cutmarks on specimens in this fauna, which are more
common in faunas that are not so highly weathered.

SUMMARY
This report offers criteria for element and taxonomic identifications. Most of the specimens are
too fragmented to provide diagnostic criteria for identification. As a result, only brief discussion
of taphonomy is possible. The fauna is small, yet it contains remains of a taxon that is important
in terms of its biogeography—Bison bison. The rest of the fauna primarily reflects taxa that are
commonly represented as remains of prehistoric diet throughout much of the Midwest and Texas.
A few taxa, e.g., snakes, might have been naturally deposited. The fauna is remarkably uniform
in its taphonomy, which is a product of nearly all of the remains being highly weathered and
fragmented.
