Abstract
Southwest Engineers of Gonzales, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a linear cultural resources survey of a proposed waterline right-of-way
in northern Guadalupe and southern Hays counties, Texas. The Crystal Clear Water Supply
Corporation proposes to install approximately 19,000 feet (3.6 miles) of new water lines known
as “Redwood Distribution Improvements, Phases 1 and 2”, near Redwood, Texas. The total
Area of Potential Effect is 3.6 miles (19,000 feet) long x 20 feet wide, for a total of 8.72 acres.
Federal funding is being provided by USDA - Rural Development. As such, this project was
undertaken under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. In addition,
although roughly 98 percent of the right-of-way lies on privately owned property, small portions
of the right-of-way will either cross under, or parallel Farm-to-Market (FM) 621 within a
TxDOT right-of-way. Therefore, Texas Antiquities Permit #6586 was issued in order to proceed
with the archaeological investigations.
Tierras Antiguas conducted a thorough pedestrian survey with shovel testing on July 5 and 6,
2013 resulting in the discovery of no previously undocumented archaeological sites. However,
41HY288 (historic house site) was encountered and documented. Our assessment of the portion
of the site that will be impacted by construction of the pipeline is heavily disturbed and nonsignificant.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Crystal Clear Water Supply
Corporation project should be allowed to proceed as currently designed. The project should be
considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program,
and as such, the project should be allowed to proceed without further archaeological work.
However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should
immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras
Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical
Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

The project was funded by a U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development grant. Based
upon a Scope of Work and Antiquities Permit Application, the Texas Historical Commission
issued Permit #6586, authorizing the cultural resources survey. In addition to a surface survey,
Tierras Antiguas excavated 69 shovel tests. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).

total to about
600 feet in thickness, the upper part of the Navarro/ Marlbrook is comprised of calcareous, gray
silty clay. The upper part of the roughly 200-feet thick Pecan Gap Chalk is chalky marl in a light
gray and white matrix. Notably, neither of these formations are described as bearing good
quality raw materials such as chert or quartzite for manufacturing stone tools. (Barnes 1974;
Judson and Kauffman 1990; Spearing 1991). Instead, the good quality chert cobbles and gravels
observed during the current survey are ancient, but much later fluvatile deposits.
As shown in Figure 5, there are five different soil types within the PA that offer varying depths,
sedimentation and deposition rates, and some are in close proximity to intermittent streams. As
such, they likewise imply the potential for the preservation of intact cultural resources to exist.

The Project Area lies within the Blackland Prairie physiographic region of Texas (Figure 6), and
in an area where the group(s) which occupied it were advantageously able to exploit an ecotone
encompassing riverine, upland, and semi-arid adapted plants and animals. The Blackland Prairie
lies at the base of the Balcones Escarpment, in the broad Gulf Coastal region, and follows the
fault zone from the Red River to the Rio Grande, varying in width from 15 to 70 miles along its
course (Alvarez and Plocheck 2013).
Although the Blackland Prairie is located in the Gulf Coastal Plains region, it is considered its
own physiographic region. Distinction between the Blackland Prairie and the Gulf Coastal Plain
is based on the types of soils underlying the areas. Creation of the soils occurred during the late
Tertiary, with the erosion of soils on the Edwards Plateau. These soils were then deposited by
a combination of eolian and colluvial processes across an existing eroding parent material
4

(Midway Group) of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Thus the mixture of Tertiary and Quaternary
calcareous clay soils accumulated to great depths (Black 1989). Geographically, the Blackland
Prairie is characterized as an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage that is prone to
frequent flooding (Collins 2004).

Cultural Context and Chronology
Introduction
The Project Area is located within the Central Texas archaeological region (Figure 7). The most
basic chronology of the Central Texas regions can be divided into either: (1) prehistoric cultural
groups with no specific tribal affiliation, or; (2) historically documented groups with a
designated tribal or band name. Before Spanish soldiers and Catholic missionaries arrived in
Texas, the cultural
activities of the groups
of prehistoric Native
Americans who
inhabited the region can
only be surmised from
what we can glean from
t he archaeol ogi cal
records at undisturbed,
and well-documented
sites. Historic cultural
groups are those
observed firsthand by
the Spanish soldiers and
priests beginning in the
late 1500s. The Spanish
then began recording
their encounters by
writing the names,
numbers, and living
conditions of the many
gro u p s of Nat i ve
Americans who lived in
the region. However,
there is a significant

the least archaeologically
known prehistoric cultural groups, and the historic Native Americans that the Spanish
documented; the transition era occurs in the 1500s when Spanish explorers and treasure seekers
ventured through Texas.
The Prehistoric Chronology
Based on research in Texas over the past 70+ years, beginning with professionals from the
University of Texas at Austin, archaeologists have been able to segregate the prehistoric period
in Central Texas into the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods (Figure 8). Although
other archaeologists have made significant foundational contributions to our current
understanding of how past cultures changed through time (e.g., Story 1985; Prewitt 1981), the
6

most current and widely recognized chronology for Central Texas are those offered by Michael
Collins (1995; 2004).
Paleoindian Period (11,500-8,800 years ago)
With minor differences observed in the archaeological record across the wide expanse of Central
Texas, this period spans the past years estimated at between ca. 11,500 and 8,800 years ago
(Collins 1995:381–383; 2004). Diagnostic artifacts include a unique, fluted, finely flaked, and
blade-shaped spear or dart point called “Clovis”, other stone tools chipped on both sides, and
unique prismatic blade-like flakes systematically knocked off from river cobbles. Archaeologists
have documented Clovis-age sites in Central and South Texas such as killsites, quarries, stone
tool caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Collins 1995:381–383; 2004). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in Central and South Texas;
however, no campsites or killsites have been found south of Bexar County (Hester
1995:434–435).
During this 2,700-year Paleoindian period around the project area, the Native Americans we
term as the Paleoindian culture were likely one of small bands of nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and
horse that are now extinct in North America (Black 1989). Nevertheless, when big game was
not available, we have archaeological evidence that the Paleoindian peoples supplemented their
diet by eating turtles, tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins 1995:381; 2004).
Archaic Period (8,000-1,200 years ago)
Primarily, by studying the differences in the stone tools, the diversities in campsites or other
types of sites, the locations of the sites, as well as many other measurable and analytical
observations such as ethnobotanical and faunal remains found at Central Texas archaeological
sites, archaeologists have been able to dissect about 6,000 years of our past into what we
commonly term the “Archaic”. Based on these same aforementioned affinities, the Archaic has
further been defined in terms of the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic, and the Late Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8,800-6,000 years ago)
The region was most probably occupied by small groups who moved almost constantly during
the Early Archaic period. Archaeologists have observed a distinctive change in projectile point
styles that are unique to this period; they include Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched
dart points. Although they were still very much hunters and gatherers, the large animals such as
mammoths that their Paleoindian ancestors had hunted were by this time extinct. To survive,
they capitalized on exploiting the other abundant food resources that Central Texas had to offer
Texas—such as deer, fish, rodents, prickly pear tunas, and various plant bulbs and tubers.
Archaeologists point to the increased numbers of ground stone, firecracked limestone used in
cooking ovens larger in size than normal campfires, and specialized stone processing tools as
evidence that Native Americans refocused their pursuit of foodstuffs (Weir 1976; McKinney
1981; Story 1985; Collins 1995; Hester 1995).

Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000-4,000 years ago?)
When this period actually began and ended is always debatable among archaeologists. Some
(e.g., Collins 1995; 2004) see a significant pattern in the archaeological record between 6,000
and 4,000 years ago, but others (e.g., Hester 1995) don’t think the same changes were prevalent
until much later in South Texas - about between 4,500 and 2,400 years ago. Nevertheless, the
climate began changing in Central Texas beginning around 6,000 years ago, and a continuum
of dry climate known as the Altithermal, is believed by some archaeologists to have caused the
Native Americans to gather in larger groups. They gathered in large groups to exploit plant foods
that were more dependable than larger game animals such as bison (Sollberger and Hester
1972:338; Weir 1976:125, 128; Story 1985:40). Archaeologists have found more sites that date
to this period, and in Summer seasons the groups apparently took advantage of the numerous
prickly pear tunas and pads that thrived in the environs of South-Central Texas, as well as deer
and rabbit (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15; Collins 1995:38; 20043).
Later, they apparently congregated along the many creeks and rivers in the area to gather the
abundant and nutritional nuts ripening in the Fall (Black 1989). On the Edwards Plateau, they
may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large cooking ovens to steam the tanic
acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large cooking ovens were apparently
used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used within just a few years or over
several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems to be that they were used
to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin
et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of accumulated firecracked rocks
are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community, but are sometimes referred
to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
Late Archaic (4,000-1,200 years ago?)
As with the Middle Archaic period, differences in the traits of Native Americans inhabiting
Central Texas during the Late Archaic period may have occurred over several hundred years.
Whether it was a matter of cultural adaptation or an adaption to the environment is questionable.
In either case, the uniqueness seen in archaeological sites of the two regions imply that change
may have been slower in South Texas than in Central Texas.
Collins (1995; 2004) dates the final interval of the Archaic in Central Texas to approximately
4,000–1,200 years ago. The large cooking ovens which after repeated uses coalesced into burned
rock middens, intensified during the Late Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Some
researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while
others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Although
the Native Americans of Central Texas still sought the abundant acorns, prickly pear, and
riverine plant foods such as nuts, the slightly cooler and moister climate allowed them to pursue
other food goods. Even though by about 1,500 years ago the gregarious, large herds of bison
no longer predominated the now-dwindling grasslands of Central Texas (Dillehay 1974), the
Native Americans still hunted and/or gathered deer and smaller animals such as rabbits, rodents,
fish, and turtles (Black 1989:30).
Although farther south, near Brownsville and Rockport, the Native Americans inhabiting those
9

areas began making pottery about 1,800 years ago, those groups farther to the north, either
elected not to make pottery vessels, lacked the skills, or because of their generally highly
nomadic lifestyle, simply elected not to use the easily breakable vessels until 1,000± years later
(Story 1985:45–47). In addition to the uniqueness of Central Texas’ hunter-gatherers not
adapting to the use of pottery, archaeologists have also observed a noticeable change in the
styles/types of killing dart points used during the Late Archaic. Dart points were manufactured
to be used with the atlatyl, a spear-like shaft with a dart point attached to it, and thrown or
launched from over the shoulder. It would not be until perhaps 1,200 years ago that the bow-andarrow was adapted for use for hunting in the region. Late Archaic dart points tend to be much
smaller than Middle Archaic points, and the most common dart points that are found within the
area are what archaeologists call Ensor and Frio types (Turner and Hester 1999:114,122).
As with most spectrums of scientific research, there is ongoing speculation amongst professional
archaeologists as to when, and what traits mark a transition between the Late Archaic, huntergatherer practices of Central Texans and the Late Prehistoric peoples who presumably began to
settle down into territorial groups claiming a part of the landscape as their own.
Transitional Archaic (2,300 - 1,300 years ago?)
A clear and abrupt transition of Native Americans adapting or developing the traits that
archaeologists define as being inclusive to the Late Archaic period, separate from the Late
Prehistoric period, around the project area is simply not distinct in the many sites that
archaeologists have been able to excavate and analyze. In effect, some of the same
characteristics that archaeologists see in Late Archaic artifacts and earlier Late Prehistoric
assemblages left behind are nearly identical - or at least transitional in technology and style.
Therefore, some archaeologists prefer to deem this transitional period as the “Terminal, or
Transitional Archaic”, spanning from approximately 1,200 to perhaps as long ago as 2,300 years
ago - depending on where in Central Texas the groups who left behind the now-present
archaeological sites were living (Weir 1976; Hester 1995). Nevertheless, the increased number
of burned rock midden sites that archaeologists have documented in Central Texas, and that date
to this time period, suggest that people returned time and again to the same sites to once again
take advantage of cooking and eating the abundant plants available during this time (e.g.,
Mauldin et al. 2003).
Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,250-300 Years Ago)
Although artifacts commonly associated with earlier Late Archaic occupations are also found
on some Late Prehistoric-in-age archaeological sites, archaeologists have documented a distinct
change in projectile point styles that Native Americans began manufacturing about 1,250 years
ago. These stone points suggest that Native Americans in the Central Texas region surrounding
the Crystal Clear project area adapted the bow-and-arrow as a weapon rather than the shoulderthrown atlatyl with a dart point attached. As such, the stone points devised for killing became
much smaller and streamlined. In layman terminology, the smaller, sleeker shafts arrow shafts
carried an “arrowhead”, instead of a dart point. Archaeologists have found Edwards and Scallorn
arrow points dating to the earliest 600+ years of the period (e.g., Goode 1991:71). Concurrently,
excavations by professional archaeologists have provided evidence that Native Americans began
using crude clay pottery vessels made from local clays, as well as perhaps trading vessels from
10

the South, Southeast Coastal, and Northeast Texas regions. As with any successful venture, the
making of pottery was refined so that vessels were used more, and the technique of firing
became perhaps an art (e.g., Story 1985:45-47; Black 1989:32; Hester 1995; Nickels 2000).
Archaeologists probably know more about the Native Americans who lived in Texas during this
time than any other time in prehistory (Hester 1995). They continued to build large cooking
ovens, or burned rock middens in which they roasted tubers, nuts, and some game animals (see
for example, Mauldin et al. 2003). During this same period, the inhabitants may have increased
their dependence upon bison (Steele and Assad- Hunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991) suggests
that the sudden return of bison to Central Texas resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains
north of Texas, and increased grassiness in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north
Central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of
the Edwards Plateau (Huebner 1991:354–355).
One theory is that perhaps there were not as many people occupying Central Texas and the area
around the Crystal Clear WSC project area during the Late Prehistoric period (Black 1989:32).
We do know that they began occupying the limestone overhangs and rockshelters created by the
many creeks and rivers cutting into the Balcones Escarpment limestone cliffs. Examples of
rockshelters occupied by Native Americans along the escarpment include Scorpion Cave beside
the Medina River in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978), Classen Rockshelter along Cibolo
Creek in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967), and Timmeron Rockshelter in Hays
County (Harris 1985).
Historic Period
Primarily beginning slightly over 350 years ago, European explorers, entrepreneurs, Catholic
missionaries, and government officials encroached into what is today Central Texas in everincreasing numbers. This transitional end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic
period in both Central Texas is characterized by a continuum of written accounts of European
contact with the numerous indigenous, Native American groups encountered in the region. In
Central Texas, we can be ever grateful to the meticulous writings of the Spanish priests and
government officials for their recording of the names, numbers, and lifeways of the indigenous
groups. Dr. Thomas Hester (1995) is most often credited with recognizing this transitional
period between the Late Prehistoric and the Historic, and labels this largely unknown period as
the “Protohistoric.”
Traveling northward from present-day central Mexico in the 1500s and 1600s, the Spanish
encountered numerous small groups of Coahuiltecans (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell
1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). In later years, intrusive groups
such as the Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche took over the lands roamed by the
Coahuiltecans (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993;
Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
For example, around A.D. 1700, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed northward
by continual Spanish expansion. But by about 1750, the Apache, adapting to a more Southern
Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting, entered what is today’s Texas from the northwest. Their
11

incursion was especially rapid because they had acquired horses from the Spaniards (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27). As if the indigenous groups were not effectively dispersed and
disrupted by the Apaches, the remnants of native American cohesion that previously existed in
Central Texas were even further disrupted by the nomadic, bison-hunting Comanche from the
High Plains of Texas (Campbell 1991:111).
Thus ensued over a century of turmoil for those numerous, but splintered Native American
groups who had established a semi-permanent foothold in Central Texas before the arrival of
the Apache and Comanche. They must have been heavily traumatized and significantly
demoralized over the constant conflicts resulting in death, and the mysterious diseases caused
by the forced continual mixing and remixing among ethnicities from around the regions and the
world (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Supposedly, there were dozens if
not hundreds of language dialects that were spoken by the earlier inhabitants, but nearly all have
been lost (e.g. Johnson 1994; Johnson and Campbell 1992).
Amidst the turmoil, the Spanish Catholic missions became a refuge for many of the otherwise
dispersed bands and tribes within Texas. By the early 1700s, several missions had been
established, and reestablished within the Nacogdoches and San Antonio areas (Campbell and
Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja 1995; Habig 1968a, 1968b; Hard et al. 1995). Those
that entered the missions did so usually voluntarily, seeking refuge from more powerful, warring
bands or tribes. Others did so because they were starved for food that the protective missions
could offer in seasons of natural destitution. Regardless, the Spanish government saw the
Catholic religious zeal as a means of peaceful conquest in an otherwise untenable, unsettled, and
hostile environment. At the same time, each and every Native American who relied upon support
from the Spanish missions became less of a threat to eventual Spanish domination of the region,
and infiltration by France or other countries (Campbell 1975:2; 1991:346–347).
Although a treaty with the Apaches in 1749 brought peace for a while, Apaches continued to
range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s, pushed southward
by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of Central Texas (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27; de la Teja 1995:100). In 1785, a peace treaty was agreed to in Santa Fe,
New Mexico between the Spanish Crown and the Comanches. Although the ceremony of this
treaty took place hundreds of miles to the west, its signing signaled the opening of a period of
peaceful coexistence in what is today Bexar County, in which Comanches brought hides, meat,
and tallow to San Antonio to trade for goods and services not available elsewhere, such as
blacksmithing and gun repair (Fehrenbach 1983:221-224; Poyo and Hinojosa 1991:125-126).
In 1821, after a hard-fought rebellion, Mexico gained its national sovereignty from Spain;
including the vast expanse that was to become the Republic of Texas. After only 15 years, the
combined Tejano and Euro-American compatriots rebelled against Mexican rule, and defeated
the Mexican army to declare an independent Republic of Texas in 1836. By the 1840s, the city
of San Antonio was well-established as the most progressive and most populated city in the
newly formed Republic.
Apaches continued to range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s,
pushed southward by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of central
12

Texas (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Weary of warfare with the Comanche, a few Apache
were beginning to seek asylum in the missions (McGraw and Hindes 1987:367; West 1904:50).
The newly formed government of Texas gave land grants that were large, consisting of around
5,000 acres for each property, and Spanish cattle ranching became prevalent south and southeast
of San Antonio (Jackson 1986).
The first land grant in what is today Guadalupe County was titled in 1806. Settlers from the
United States arrived in the area between 1827-1835 led by empressarios Green DeWitt and
James Kerr Colony (Roell 1996). However, Indian depredations from groups such as the
Karankawas, Comanches, Tonkawas, and Lipan Apaches at the time forced many settlers to
abandon their grants in the 1830s. Following the Texas Revolution in 1836, most Native
American groups ceased hostilities, with the exception of the Comanches. By 1838, Captain
John Coffee Hays had established a Texas Ranger Camp at Walnut Springs (modern-day
Seguin), and the area progressively became more secure for settlement (Smyrl 1996).
In nearby Hays County, a number of Spanish entradas visited the San Marcos springs and
crossed the San River below the springs enroute to east Texas in the 1600s and 1700s. Although
Mission San Xavier and the San Francisco Xavier Presidio were briefly located near the springs
in 1755-1756, they were moved to San Antonio. San Marcos de Neve was a failed attempt by
the Spanish to establish a settlement on the San Marcos River, just 1.1 miles northeast of the
Crystal Clear WCS pipeline. However, after four years of flooding and Indian attacks by both
Tonkawas and Comanches, the settlement was abandoned in 1811 (Cecil and Greene 1996;
Horrell 1999). As with the area around present-day Guadalupe County, Indian hostilities were
generally thwarted by the mid-1830s, so that selected land grants issued by Mexico and the State
of Texas were being occupied.

Site Types That Could be Expected Along the Crystal Clear Water Supply
Corporation Redwood Pipeline Right-of-Way
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Guadalupe and Hays counties are prehistoric open
campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure
8). Some of these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans
may have camped for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas
representing large groups of people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with
ancestral groups returning to these same campsites over a period of several thousands of years.
Cultural remains to be found at these large campsites include among other items, an abundance
of fire-cracked rocks representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the
lithic debris that results from making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and
seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds,
and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be
in a plush riverine environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal
foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses,
shrubs, and cacti offered a different food source that could be exploited such as various grass
13

seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various
times, bison were known to graze on the northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought
after for use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of Central Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients
that can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a
well-preserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most
frequently occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in
upland settings where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients
that archaeologists look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic
preservation in the form of charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation,
temporally diagnostic stone tools or ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that could be expected
along the Crystal Clear right-of-way. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and
broken tools that were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their
old ones. The general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found
at open campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period
of time ( However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles
to make them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the
natural outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite
cobbles. Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with
one or two flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from
experience the quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool
production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was usable or not. If the quality was
judged to be inferior, then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested
cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished
stone tool products are carried away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during
the manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and
angular debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry
blanks’. These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable
‘blank’ that can be used to further reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken
off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not found on these sites because they have been
carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The
snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in Hays and Guadalupe counties have
been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.

14

Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but
differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at
times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were
not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types
of sites are generally rare in central Texas because it is much easier to pick up gravels from the
widely scattered and exposed surfaces than to try to mine them from hard rock. Nevertheless,
because of the many limestone formations with chert inclusive gravels, prehistoric quarries or
procurement sites in Central Texas are not infrequent. Quarried and chipped stone remains likely
to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well as parent
material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed
much like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses,
as the larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less
effective as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit
becomes unusable, another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple
pits and the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as
indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the formation of burned rock middens and their
documented presence in Texas, see Leach and Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al.
2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in
Central Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open
campsites in both upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, within rock shelter
overhangs, and within limestone sinkholes.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology section above, Spanish entradas with
government officials and Catholic priests began recording their encounters with local Native
American groups as early as the late 1500s. However, as yet there are no documents discovered
that would suggest a permanent historic presence within the area until the mid-1800s (Smryl
1996:1062). The most common historic site types to be encountered are related to ranching and
farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types most
commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation remains
from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial or
cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects. In general, the area has been historically used predominantly as ranchland
pasture, with no development other than associated ranching activities such as windmills, stock
tanks, corrals, and sparsely scattered outbuildings.

Previous Archaeological Work in the Area

Guadalupe County
As of July 12, 2013 professional and avocational archaeologists have managed to document 149
sites in Guadalupe County. Of those, 56 are prehistoric open campsites, and 40 are prehistoric
lithic scatters or procurement sites. Only a single burned rock midden has been recorded. The
71 historic sites and historic components on prehistoric sites recorded thus far include mostly
mid- to late 19th century farmstead and ranch structures, but also family and community
cemeteries, and pottery kilns. There are also two State Archaeological Landmarks documented
within the county. The first is the historic Sebastopol House Site in Seguin, and the second is
the Saffold Dam across the Guadalupe River in Seguin (Atlas 2013). Finally, although evidence
of human intervention was found, the remains of a Pleistocene mammoth and horse were
documented at one site (Atlas 2013).
Hays County
The varied types of sites discovered in Hays County reflects the physiographic makeup of Hays
County that is situated predominately in the Edwards Escarpment Hill Country, versus the
Blackland Prairie that makes up the Guadalupe County area. That is, the number of prehistoric
lithic scatters and procurement sites in Hays County far outnumber the prehistoric open
campsites; to wit, there have been 162 lithic scatters/procurement sites documented, and 115
open campsites. Many archaeologists argue that this is due the abundance of raw material, as
well as the availability of water and subsistence resources on the Edwards Plateau and along the
Balcones Escarpment at various times in prehistory (e.g., McKinney 1981; Prewitt 1985; Collins
2004). Reflecting the same physiographic and particularly geologic makeup within the county,
there are 57 archaeological sites where burned rock middens have been documented, as well as
13 rockshelters, sinkholes, or caves.
Remarkably, there have been a relatively very high number of historic sites and historic
components on prehistoric sites recorded in Hays County. A total of 157 historic components
include such diverse entities as numerous 1800s and 1900s home sites and farmsteads, family
and communal cemeteries, log cabins, hand-dug wells, dams and mill races for gins, a lime kiln,
rock walls and stone corrals, stage stops and post offices, as well as the settlement of San
Marcos de Neve (discussed above), the General Burleson homestead site, and the route of the
Spanish Camino Real. Out of the 439 total recorded site in Hays County, 25 have been
designated as State Archaeological Landmarks (Atlas 2013).
Archaeological Surveys and Sites within One Mile of the Current Project Area
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archaeological sites (Atlas 2013)
indicated that although the proposed right-of-way had not been subjected to a formal cultural
resources survey, there are ten archaeological sites in close proximity to the Crystal Clear
project. Their locations are shown in Figure 3, and they are briefly described in Table 2.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with intensive shovel testing. The topics addressed
were site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical
framework is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems
for the Central Texas region. The historic framework is structured around the settlement in the
Blackland Praie east of San marcos as documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish
priests and government representatives, through Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty,
and into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)
locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a
systematic survey methodology;
2)
quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
3)
place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Pre-field Preparation
Before the official survey began, the Principal Investigator inspected the project area to better
understand the topography, surface visibility, and site potential. In addition, he met with Mr.
Michael Taylor and Mr. Michael Fournier of Crystal Clear WCS to discuss the survey strategy
and methods.
17

The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, 100% pedestrian survey of the 3.6-mile
linear right-of-way was conducted. Surface visibility ranged from 20 to 100 percent along the
right-of-way. A total of 69 shovel tests were placed in a systematic pattern along the right-ofway (Figures 9 and 10). The results of shovel testing were fully documented on a Shovel Test
form, and are shown in Appendix B. The shovel tests were dug in 20-centimeter (cm) levels, and
all sediments were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh (Figure 11). Following our designed
research plan, any artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be
placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel tests.
Photographs of structures possibly 45 years or older were photographed, and they are shown in
Appendix A.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
Surface visibility ranged from
20 to100 percent along the
right-of-way (ROW). Roughly
85% of the ROW coursed
through cultivated agricultural
fields or previously machine
cleared pastures (see for
examples, Figures 11 and 13).
The results of shovel testing
were fully documented on
Shovel Test forms, and as
previously stated, those results
are described in Appendix B.
No evidence of prehistoric
cultural material was observed
either on the surface or within
any of the 69 shovel tests along
the ROW. The only evidence of
historic cultural material was
on previously recorded site
41HY288 (described below).

Archaeological Site 41HY288
Description
This site was first recorded in 1997 by Paul Price Associates during a waterline survey for the
Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (see Figure 3). At that time they described it as a prehistoric
campsite and historic domestic artifact scatter. It is located near the northeast corner intersection

was the locale of a
prehistoric campsite. In addition, they observed a porcelain doll leg, whiteware sherds, clear
bottle glass, a blue willow ceramic sherd, and a fence staple. The majority of the historic

22

artifacts were located on
the surface in an area
heavily disturbed by
construction of a stock pond
(see Figure 14). The
only artifact found in
the four shovel tests
they dug at the time was

brown glass sherd extending approximately 180 feet along the ROW (see Figure 14). No
prehistoric artifacts were observed. Although historic artifacts were recovered from all three
shovel tests within the site area along the ROW (see Appendix B for results of shovel testing),
archaeologists noted the heavily disturbed soils and large vertical cracks present. A round nail
and clear bottle glass
sherd with no hue were
recovered from 0-40

(ST1). Clear glass
sherds with no hue,
brown glass sherds, an

23

A search for old maps or aerials that would show any existing structures revealed that in 1911
there was a structure in that general location. However, note that the intersection is significantly
different than what it is today (i.e., compare Figure 14 with Figure 18).

quadrangle (Texas Historic Overlay 2013).

24

A 1936 map of Hays County indicates that the structure was still there (Figure 19), and the
intersection configuration appears to have not changed since 1911.

Steiger during
the early 1900s. Dr. De Steiger died in 1910, and his will split his many holdings among his wife
Julia, and their seven children. That same year, the seven children deeded sole ownership to the
property in question to Julia.

26

In 1924, Julia’s daughter, Versula T. (De Steiger) Ferguson signed a promissary note with Texas
Farm Mortgage & Investment Company in San Marcos to purchase 147 acres from her mother
Julia, as well as other properties. Apparently Versula could not make good on her loans, and in
December 1936 she was threatened with foreclosure by State Bank & Trust in San Marcos (Hays
County Deed and Records, Vol. 40, pp. 372-373). As a result, the property in question was sold
at public auction at the Hays County courthouse on October 1936 to the highest bidder - John
Hancock Life Insurance Co. They held onto the property for five years before selling it to James
Wilkinson and H. W. Fielder in 1946.
In sum, besides owning the property in question during the early 1900s, Dr. De Steiger and his
family also owned multiple properties in San Marcos, and it is unlikely that a family of his size
and stature would have lived in the rural area where 41HY288 is located. However, it is possible
that one of his children, and possibly Versula, could have had a small house in the immediate
area. Nevertheless, as discussed above, Versula was forced into foreclosure in 1936, and the
property acquired by an insurance company. We surmise that shortly thereafter any probable
small wood structure that existed on the property was abandoned, and likely demolished or
moved.

Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
The exact location of the structure that appears on the early 1900s maps will likely remain an
unknown unless additional archaeological investigations are undertaken in the future. A search
for Dr. Edward De Steiger both online and in hard copy publications failed to reveal that he was
a person of historic significance, as well as any of the other landowners. The few historic
artifacts recovered from shovel testing with the 20-foot pipeline right-of-way were found in
disturbed contexts. No prehistoric artifacts either on the surface or within the shovel tests.
Accordingly, we assess the portion of the site that will be impacted by construction of the
Crystal Clear pipeline as possessing little if any research potential, and has little ability to
contribute significantly to our understanding of this area of Central Texas prehistory or history.
In view of this, Tierras Antiguas recommends construction of the pipeline be allowed to proceed
through the site, with no further investigations.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100% pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the project
area was conducted, along with the excavation of 69 shovel tests. The only evidence of cultural
resources consisted of an upland ephemeral scatter of historic artifacts suggesting an early 1900s
occupation, and archival research indicates the same (41HY288). Given its disturbed context and
absence of historical significance, its potential for scientific research is minimal at best.
As such, we recommend that construction of the Crystal Clear WSC project should be allowed
to proceed as currently designed. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any
properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or
inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be
allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
