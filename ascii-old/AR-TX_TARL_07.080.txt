ABSTRACT
Between October 30 and November 6, 1984, personnel from the Texas
Archeological
Research
Laboratory
conducted
archeological
investigations at the proposed City of Austin Water Treatment Plant
Number 4, Travis County, Texas. Work consisted of an intensive survey
and preliminary assessment of cultural resources within the proposed
location.
Seven archeological sites were identified.
Prehistoric sites
include three small lithic scatters (41TV930, 41TV931 and 41TV932), a
small campsite (41TV929) and a rockshelter (41TV933). Except for the
rockshelter, these sites are too ephemeral and disturbed to be
eligible for nomination to the National Reglster of Histor asic Places
or as State Archeological Landmarks. Apparently intact deposits are
present at the rockshelter and additional testing is necessary for an
accurate assessment of this site.
Historic sites identified include a windmill (41TV934) and a rock
wa 11 (4ITV928), neither of whi ch are felt to be eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or State
Archeological Landmark status.
These results indicate that construction of the proposed water
treatment plant will not impact significant cultural resources. It
was recommended that the only site
potentially
eligible
for
nomination, the prehistoric rockshelter, be tested for National
Register eligibility should future development adversely affect this
site.
Acting on the above recommendations, assessment testing at
prehistoric rockshelter site 41TV933 was undertaken between December
10 and 12, 1984, and is discussed in the Appendix to this report. The
shelter provides evidence of two Late Archaic occupations. Up to 55
centimeters of intact stratified deposits contain a small hearth,
chipped lithic tools and debitage, bone, mussel shell and charcoal. A
high information yield potential is indicated and 41TV933 appears
eligible
for
State Archeological Landmark status and possible
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. If the site
cannot be preserved or protected during proposed construction, the
loss of this significant site should be mitigated.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Austin has proposed construction of Water Treatment
Plant Number 4 (WTP 4) at the headwaters of Bull Creek in north
central Travis County, Texas (Fig.
1).
Between October 30 and
November 6, 1984, personnel from the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory conducted archeological investigations within the proposed
plant location.
Work was accomplished during the project planning
phase under contract to Glass Environmental Consultants, Inc., while
the proposed location was still private property. Although no Texas
Antiquities Permit was required at the time of the investigations,
work was designed to be in compliance with applicable regulations once
the City of Austin began the permitting phase of plant construction.
The proposed location of WTP 4 is west of Austin, approximately
1.5 miles northeast of Four Points, Texas, the intersection of FM 620
and FM 2222. The tract is a rough rectangle oriented northeast to
southwest, covering slightly more than 240 acres (Fig. 1). Plant
construction will be concentrated on the 130 acre plateau summit in
the southeastern half of the proposed location. An additional 45
acres of gently sloping land may also be be used for
plant
construction. A planned access road will be within upland portions of
the tract. Steep canyon walls and the floor of the Bull Creek
tributary in the northwestern half of the tract will not be affected
during plant construction.
However, cultural resource management
recommendations are provided for these areas so that the City of
Austin can plan for their future use.
Archeological investigations reported herein include an inventory
of all prehistoric and historic cultural resources within the proposed
plant location and preliminary assessments of these
resources.
Investigative methods are discussed prior to presenting environmental
and cultural background data. Cultural resources identified during
the survey are then described and assessed according to criteria for
nomination to the National Register for Historic Places.
Finally,
project specific recommendations are prOVided which minimize adverse
affects to any significant sites within specific impact areas.

METHODS
This section describes investigative methods employed during the
current project.
Methods used to accomplish the primary research
goal, identification and assessment of cultural resources present, are
described first.
The research orientation used to address the
secondary research goal of data integration is then discussed.

SURVEY
An intensive survey of the entire 240 acres within the proposed
WTP 4 location was conducted using systematic transects within each
major topographic division. Each transect consisted of two persons
spaced at a 25 meter interval. The tributary canyon floor required
two transects. More confined topographic features, the canyon rim and
canyon walls, were each surveyed by single transects. Upland portions
of the tract were covered by 8 transects, following compass bearings
oriented with the long axis of the tract. A total of 6 person days
were required to complete the field portion of the project.
During the survey, special attention was paid both to areas of
high ground surface visibility and high site probability. Ground
surface visibility was generally very good due to the sparcity of
vegetation and thinness of soil covering bedrock. Only within the
canyon floor was there any question of locating sites from surface
examination.
During investigations in nearby areas (Howard and
Freeman 1984) terrace sites were identified during the ground survey,
and testing as a method of site location was largely ineffective.
Testing was used only to a limited degree during the current project.
True terraces were absent and the landforms within the canyon floor Â­
gentle slopes of mixed colluvium, alluvium and gravel bars - were not
considered areas of high site probability.
Given the absence of
surficial cultural materials, testing was limited to two 25 x 25
centimeter shovel probes used to document soils within the tributary
canyon floor; all matrix was screen through 1/4-inch hardware cloth.
Assessment of the impacts of land clearing within the proposed
plant location assumed major importance during the survey. Usually
such assessments are limited to adverse effects to known site areas.
Due to the intensity of local clearing activities and the fragile
nature of many upland sites, assessment was expanded to include
problems in site identification.
Extensive burning of vegetation
resulted in burned rocks covering major portions of the tract,
obscuring any burned rocks occurring in prehistoric contexts. Chert
became the sole indicator of prehistoric occupation.
Any historic
structural remains once present may have been severely disturbed
during clearing and their identification made more difficult. Special
care, specifically more intensive examination of high site probability
areas, was taken during the survey to minimize the effects of land
clearing on site identification.
Primary survey documentation consisted of State of Texas Site
Survey Forms and a daily journal, outlining methods and findings.
Both black and white and color photographs were taken.
Identified
sites, environments occurring within the tract and evidence of land
clearing activities were documented photographically. Two projectile
point fragments collected from prehistoric site 41TV931 were examined
by Elton R.
Prewitt and are stored at the Texas Archeological
written

SITE ASSESSMENT
Each site is assessed according to criteria for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places. Only the assessment of site
41TV933, a rockshelter with apparently intact deposits, is preliminary
in nature.
Further work is necessary at this site for a positive
assessment. Sites were assessed on the basis of surface examination
and shovel testing of site areas with sufficient soil development.
RESEARCH ORIENTATION
The scope of the current project is too limited to provide
meaningful cultural summaries necessary for regional data integration.
Subsequently, research is designed to augment a recent cultural model
developed on the basis of more extensive work just to the north of the
project area (Howard and Freeman 1984).
The
model
describes
aboriginal use of different environmental settings, based on the
number and kinds of prehistoric sites from defined cultural phases and
periods.
The environmental strata and cultural divisions used here
are designed to be compatible with those of Howard and Freeman.

PROJECT SETTING
The proposed plant location is near the southeastern margin of
the Edwards Plateau, a flat to gently rolling feature at the southern
limit of the Great Plains (Fenneman 1931). Since subsidence along the
Balcones Fault Zone, the plateau margin has become dissected by stream
downcutting and development, creating the Hill Country Physiographic
sub-province (Woodruff 1975). The plant location occupies the central
portion of the Jollyville Plateau, a small, isolated upland remnant
above the headwaters of Bull Creek (Bureau of Economic Geology 1974).
GEOLOGY
The Edwards Plateau consists of Cretaceous age marine deposits
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1974). The Jollyville plateau is capped
by relatively resistant limestone, an undivided member of the Late
Cretaceous
Fredericksburg Group.
Underlying this Fredericksburg
member is the upper member of the Glen Rose Group of limestones,
dolomites and marls which form the floors and lower slopes of area
canyons. Deposits composed of rocky colluvium and predominately
fine-grained
alluvium have accumulated on canyon floors during
Cenozoic and modern times.
LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY
At the local level, topography is the result of interplay between
characteristics of surface geology and hydrology, primarily stream
downcutting. The summit of the Jollyville Plateau is flat to gently
sloping.
The portion of the plateau summit within the proposed plant
location is actually the crest of a ridge which separates two branches
of Bull Creek headwaters at the margin of the plateau. Gentle ridge
slopes separate the summit from soil-covered benches which form the
rim of the tributary canyon within the tract.
Tributary canyon walls consist of moderately sloping, rocky land,
occurring just below the rim, and a steep broken slope. Two slope
drainages have developed narrow side canyons, probably due to spring
runoff. A vertical drop and a rockshelter, formed by the differential
weathering of geologic strata, occur in the larger of the two side
canyons.
The tributary canyon floor is relatively broad (approximately 100
meters);
stream gradient is low. Gentle slopes of mixed colluvium
and alluvium dominate most portions of the canyon floor. Gravel bars
have developed along the stream channel, which is incised into Glen
Rose Formation strata. Two vertical drops to pools were noted, both
near the northern end of the project area. No developed terraces were
noted.

SOILS
Two soil series occur within the proposed plant location (Soil
Conservation Service 1974).
Tarrant soils, which occupy upland
summits and slopes, develop over limestone under a cover of tall
grasses and open canopy of trees. In general, these soils are shallow
to very shallow, calcareous and mildly alkaline, stony and clayey.
Valente soils consist of deep, well-drained, calcareous and moderately
alkaline silty clays and occur in long narrow canyons.
Tarrant and Speck soils with 0 to 2 percent slopes cover the
plateau summit. These soils are rocky; limestone fragments comprise
45 percent of soil volume and 70 percent of the ground surface. Speck
soils are less rockY than Tarrant soils. Upland slopes are covered by
rolling Tarrant soils which develop on complex slopes of 5 to 13
percent.
Rock outcrops are common, covering together with rock
fragments from 30 to 60 percent of the ground surface.
Tarrant soils and rock outcrops occur on steep canyon walls
within the proposed plant location. Slopes generally vary from 18 to
40 percent but may be nearly vertical. Between 50 and 80 percent of
ground surface is covered by rock outcrops and fragments. The canyon
floor of the unnamed tributary of Bull Creek is covered by soils of
the Volente series.
HYDROLOGY
The unnamed tributary which flows through the proposed plant
location is actually a branch of the headwaters of Bull Creek. At
present, flow is intermittent; runoff during rains is rapid. Flow is
extended in duration by waters from the Glen Rose Aquifer. Spring
vents are located within the canyon floor upstream from the project
area. Length of flow is unknown, but the tributary was dry throughout
the recent drought.
Springs occur at the head of both major side canyons.
The
ceiling of the rockshelter in the larger side canyon was dripping
water at the time of the survey_ Standing water covered the bench at
the canyon rim above the second side canyon. At one time, a still
higher group of springs may have been present (Howard and Freeman
1984).
An upland gully above the main canyon of Bull Creek in the
southeast corner of the project area is the only possible spring vent
identified during the current project.
BIOTA
Area vegetation is characterized by oak-cedar woodland (Blair
1950) which dominates the margin of the Edwards Plateau. Fauna is
diverse, since the Balcones Fault Zone is the geographic boundary of

7

many eastern- and western-occurring species. Detailed summaries of
local biota are provided by studies of vegetation (Williams 1977) and
vertebrates (Oliver 1977) at the Wild Basin Preserve.
Vegetation within the project area is primarily juniper-oak
woodland.
Upland areas have been cleared of juniper trees but oak
trees cover the entire plateau summit. The original extent of open,
grass-covered areas within this woodland is unknown. Upper canyon
walls have also been cleared, but intact juniper-oak woodland occurs
on lower broken slopes. Riparian woodland with pecan, walnut, elm and
wild cherry trees occurs along one spring-fed slope drainage.
The
broad floor of the tributary canyon has been cleared, but at one time
probably supported a mixed grassland-woodland community.
ENVIRONMENTAL STRATIFICATION
For their model, Howard and Freeman
(1984)
divided the
environment into four topographic units, designed to maximize contrast
between prehistoric site locations.
All upland areas except the
canyon rim are termed upland slopes. Benches above canyon rims are
separated from similar features occurring above canyon heads.
Canyon
walls and floors are grouped together. Contrast between these two
areas is provided by the different kinds of sites (rockshelters and
terrace sites) located in each.
For the current project, this
stratification is simplified to three divisions, since the head of the
canyon within the proposed location is outside its boundaries. The
plateau summit and slopes are included in an upland slopes unit.
Other divisions correspond to those of Howard and Freeman. Major side
canyons are treated as part of the tributary canyon wall.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Discussion of local prehistory is limited here to a summary of
the model of prehistoric occupation within the Upper Bull Creek
Drainage, recently devised for an area just north of the current
project area (Howard and Freeman 1984). The model describes changes
in land use during the cultural stages and phases outlined by Prewitt
(1981) for central Texas in terms of intensity of occupation. kinds of
sites represented and their location. Table 1 summarizes the cultural
sequence used. Historic background data is presented after discussion
of the prehistoric model. No previous archeological investigations
have been conducted within the proposed plant location.

PREHISTORIC MODEL
The paucity of remains from the Paleoindian Stage apparently
indicates non-intensive use of the headwaters of the Bull Creek
drainage. Two Paleoindian components were identified in the area,
each in conjunction with materials from later occupations. The first,
a small lithic scatter, is located on an upland slope above a canyon
head containing a spring. A larger lithic scatter occurs on an upland
slope near the heads of several upland gullies marking the locations
of early springs.
Early Archaic settlement of the area increases slightly, except
during the Oakalla Phase, when the area was apparently not utilized.
Kinds of sites and their locations are similar to the preceding
Paleoindian Stage.
Lithic scatters of various sizes occur on upland
slopes, some near the heads of upland gullies. One site is associated
with an outcrop of local chert.
Intensity of occupation during the Middle Archaic is apparently
similar to the preceding Early Archaic Period.
Although lithic
scatters continue to occur, larger scatters may contain burned rock
middens.
The presence of middens seems to indicate concentration of
at least food processing activities at these locations.

The events of the Texas Revolution were, in the main, located
outside Travis County, but it is those events which shaped its
development, including that of the study area. A land bounty warrant
was issued to John E. Linn in 1854 for his service in the cause of
the Republic (Texas General Land Office 1854). Linn obtained his land
patent on a tract containing the study area in 1860 (Miller 1967:419).
Linn appears to have done nothing in the way of utilizing the
property, eventually dealing it off in parcels over the next 30 years,
mostly to persons who held them for speculative purposes (Travis
County
Deed Records N:86, 98:505).
One such speculator, John
Doughtery, acquired the study area after the Civil War and in 1872
sold 245 acres to Wiley and Elizabth Stroud (Travis County Deed
Records W2:798-799). The Strouds appear to have been the first to
actually live on the property and make residential improvements to it.
In 1884, they sold 105 acres to Henry Bonnet, including in the deed
record reference to a dwelling, outhouses and other farming oriented
improvements on the property they retained (Travis County Deed Records
Earlier, the Strouds had dealt off segments of their

property to their grandsons, M.R. Long in 1881 and John S. Stroud in
1882 (Travis County Deed Records 53:262 and 52:136). The Long deed
record refers to and uses, as a metes and bounds marker, the rock
fence found during the survey, thus dating it earlier than 1881, and
probably later than 1872.
The John S.
Stroud deed record has
reference to a house to the west of the property he acquired, one
located on lithe south face of the hillll, indicating a dwelling on the
adjacent R. G. Alexander Survey, next to the study area, and showing
the Strouds had neighbors by 1882.
In general, the pattern of sparse agriculture and homesteading
mixed with unused property held or traded for speculative purposes
continued through the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth.
An examination of the Travis County Road Records shows that from
1898-1902 the stretch of Bull Creek Road (FM 2222, then known as
Burnet Road) from Four Points running southwest for 1.3 miles had only
two houses which the surveyors could use as landmarks;
northwest of
Four Points, none appear until Anderson's Mill at Cypress Creek, more
than three miles distant.
(Travis County Commissioner's
Court
Records, Road Records Precinct 2:266-268). In 1934, present day Ranch
Road 620 was still a third class county road, while Bull Creek Road
(FM 2222) was a tamped earth road (Travis County Clerk's Records,
County Road and School Districts Map, 1934).
Such circumstances
indicate no great population influx and property development had
occurred by this time. Even the construction of the Marshall Ford
(Mansfield Dam) between 1937 and 1941 had little impdct on the area.
It was not until the recent rapid growth of Austin that the pattern of
small, 150 to 300 acre farms and homesteads set among unimproved land
tracts owned by non-residents began to change.

The five prehistoric sites within the 240 acre tract provide a
site density of one site per 48 acres. This density is significantly
lower than the one site per 16 acres obtained by Howard and Freeman

The difference is primarily due to the location of the
current project area. Sites identified by Howard and Freeman are

is outside the boundaries of the study area.
Densities obtained in
areas other than major canyon heads are more comparable.
The difference in site density may also be due in part to
differing land conditions. The area surveyed by Howard and Freeman is
generally devoid of major disturbances. The proposed plant location
has been subject to extensive land clearing which may have obscured
the locations of some sites (Fig. 3).
Project location may also limit the diversity of site types
identified during the current project.
The small number of sites
investigated is perhaps the most important factor.

sites in both areas are lithic scatters (which include upland

rockshelters were occupied in both areas as well. Burned rock midden
sites and terrace sites were not identified within the proposed plant
location.
The temporal range of prehistoric sites within the proposed plant
location ;s much more narrow than that of Howard and Freeman. All
dated components are from the Archaic Period. The absence of evidence
for occupations dating to other periods is probably due to the small
number of sites investigated and the disturbed nature of these sites.
The results of the current project provide some additional
information concerning specific details of the prehistoric model
developed by Howard and Freeman. Intensive use of tributary canyons
during the Archaic period is supported by the presence of site 41TV930
within the canyon floor.

PREHISTORIC SITE DESCRIPTIONS
41TV929
This site is a small campsite, 30 meters in diameter, located on
a soil-covered bench just above the canyon rim. Scattered burned
rocks, two biface fragments and three flakes were noted on the ground
surface.
Both bifaces appear to be manufacturing failures. Bedrock
covers approximately 40 percent of the site area and no shovel tests
were excavated.
Soil is shallow, dark brown and clayey. Woody
vegetation has been cleared from the site. Juniper/live oak woodland
has been replaced by mid-grasses, forbes and scattered oak trees.
4ITV930
41TV930 consists of cultural materials of doubtful context,
scattered over an area 5 meters in diameter. A dart point fragment, a
tertiary flake and a burned rock were noted in a unimproved road bed
in an area bulldozed during construction of a small stock pond. The
site is located near the left margin of the canyon floor on a gentle
slope composed of both colluvial and alluvial sediments. The dart
point fragment is badly burned and could not be identified. A shovel
test placed 10 meters nearer the creek revealed over 15 centimeters of
brown clayey soil with a high content of limestone rocks.
Wood
vegetation has been cleared from the site which is now covered with
short grasses.
4ITV931
41TV931 is a small lithic scatter, 10 by 15 meters in size,
located on a slight rise at the base of the upland slope. The site is
approximately 40 meters from a spring located at the head of a side
canyon. Three tertiary flakes and two projectile point fragments were
observed. One fragment has an impact fracture at its distal end and
is missing the base. The other fragment is the base of a Mahomet type
dart point. Two shovel tests excavated in different soil pockets
revealed between 2 and 15 centimeters of dark brown clayey soil. Both
tests were negative. The site area has been cleared.
Vegetation
consists of midgrasses, forbes and scattered oak trees.

This site is a small lithic scatter on a soil-covered bench above
the canyon rim.

approximately 30 percent of the site area. A shovel test revealed 6
centimeters of dark brown clayey soil overlying bedrock in one soil
pocket.
Testing was negative.
The site area has been cleared and
vegetation presently consists of scattered short grasses and annuals.

16

4lTV933
Site 41TV933 is a rockshelter within the canyon wall near the
head of a major slope drainage. A small, seasonal spring is located
at the canyon head. The shelter has formed by differential weathering
approximately three meters below the canyon rim. The opening is 10
meters long, 10 meters deep and from 30 to 100 centimeters in height.
Three chert flakes were noted on the surface of the rockshelter floor.
A shovel test excavated near the shelter's mouth revealed
15
centimeters of dark brown clayey soil with rock spalls overlying
reddish brown clay. No cultural materials were recovered in the
probe. Vegetation is riparian woodland.
HISTORIC RESOURCES
Historic sites within the proposed plant location, which are
summarized in Table 3, include a windmill (41TV934) and a rock wall
(41TV928). Neither site contains ,associated artifactual materials;
no extensive artifact scatters or early materials were noted during

The rock wall is attributable to the Stroud homestead, built in
the process of clearing rocks from fields sometime between 1872 and
1881 (see Historic Background).
The wall is apparently the only
remalnlng feature of this homestead which, from the Bonnet deed
record, consisted of a house and a number of outbuildings (Travis
County Deed Records 53:336-337). The structures were, according to
the deed, lion the creek", an uncertain location, but probably on the
tributary canyon floor near the northeastern end of the project area.

Evidence of modern use of the proposed plant location was also
observed during the survey.
A very large pond and a smaller stock
tank are evidence of modern modification of the canyon floor.
Unimproved roads provide access to both the plateau summit and canyon
floor. The area has been fenced and cleared of woody vegetation for
modern cattle ranching. Five deer blinds and associated feeders are
evidence of intensive use of the proposed location for hunting.

HISTORIC SITE DESCRIPTIONS
4lTV928
41TV928 is an historic rock wall, approximately 70 meters in
length, constructed along the canyon rim.
The wall consists of
smaller limestone rocks (30 to 40 centimeters in size) placed up to
three courses high on a base of limestone boulders (75 to 100
centimeters in size), and in some instances natural outcroppings of
limestone.
Stones were dry laid.
No artifactual materials were
observed in association with the wall. The base of the wall was not
buried and no shovel tests were excavated. Soil is dark brown and
clayey. Vegetation is juniper/live oak woodland.
4lTV934
This site is an historic windmill located on the crest of the
plateau summit.
The windmill has a metal frame and motor and is set
in a concrete slab. The wooden sucker rod has broken. The motor was
made by the Fairbury Manufacturing Company of Fairbury, Nebraska,
between 1920 and 1961. The model number is the second in a series of
similar models produced by that company, indicating it was available
somewhat after the earlier date (8aker 1984). No artifactual or other
structural remains were observed. Soil is reddish brown and rocky.
No shovel tests were excavated at the site. Woody vegetation has been
cleared from the site which now supports midgrasses, forbes and
scattered live oak trees.

ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This section assesses the cultural resources identified during
the current survey and provides project specific recommendations.
Each major topographic unit within the proposed plant location is
discussed separately.
Sites within each unit are assessed. After a
review of the nature of impacts expected during plant construction,
recommendations are made to limit adverse effects to those sites which
may be eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic

18

Places.
PLATEAU SUMMIT AND UPLAND SLOPES
Prehistoric site 41TV931 and historic site 41TV934 are located
within upland portions of the proposed plant location (Table 4). Site
41TV931 is a small surficial lithic scatter. Cultural materials are
few in number but include two projectile point fragments. The site
appears to represent short term occupation during the Late Archaic
period.
Clearing activities have adversely affected this fragile
site. The nature of the cultural materials present and disturbed
nature of the site indicate a low information yield potential. The
site does not appear eligible for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark.

TRIBUTARY CANYON RIM
Two prehistoric sites, 41TV929 and 41TV932, are located on
soil-covered benches above the canyon rim of the tributary which flows
through the project area (Table 5). Site 41TV929 is a small surficial
campsite.
Cultural materials are few in number, but include two
biface fragments. The site has been disturbed by land clearing
activities.
The nature of the cultural materials present and the
disturbed nature of the site indicate a low information yield

TRIBUTARY CANYON
Three archeological sites were identified within the tributary
canyon, prehistoric sites 41TV930 and 41TV933 and historic site
41TV928 (Table 6). The historic site is a rock wall without apparent
associations.
Unless part of an integrated ranching complex, the

to recreational facilities.
National Register eligibility testing
should be conducted at 41TV933 prior to any activities which may
adversely affect this site. Construction in other areas should not
impact significant cultural resources. Regardless of planned use of
the tributary canyon, testing should also be initiated if increased
accessibility to 41TV933 exposes the site to potential relic hunting
or pedestrian traffic.

PROJECT SUMMARY
An intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed City of
Austin Water Treatment Plant Number 4 resulted in the identification
of five prehistoric and two historic archeological sites.
The
prehistoric sites document limited use of this portion of the Upper
Evidence
Bull Creek Drainage, especially during the Archaic Period.
of occupation was noted in a variety of environments. Historic sites
represent the remains of ranching activities beginning in the 1870 1 s.
The major portion of the project area has been cleared of woody
vegetation or otherwise disturbed during historic and modern times.
The fragile prehistoric sites which characterize this area have been
severely disturbed by these activities.
Intact cultural deposits
occur only at the occupied rockshelter, 41TV933.
None of the
prehistoric lithic scatters identified appear eligible for nomination
to the National Register of Historic Places or as State Archeological
Landmarks. Additional testing at 41TV933 is necessary for an accurate
assessment of its research potential.
Historic cultural resources within the proposed plant location
may have also been adversely affected by land clearing. The remalnlng
rock wall and windmill do not comprise an integrated ranching complex.
Neither site appears eligible for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places or as State Archeological Landmarks.
Proposed or planned construction, except
prehistoric site 41TV933, will not adversely
cultural resources.

TEST EXCAVATIONS
Five test units, Units 1 through 5, were excavated (Figure 4),
Unit I, an initial stratigraphic test, was placed near the northern
end of the shelter where surficial cultural materials were observed,

positive, Unit 2 was placed near the front central portion of the
shelter where ceiling height is greatest. Since this test was largely
negative, no further testing of the front portion of the shelter was
felt to be necessary. The shelter mouth at the southern end is more
sloping and rocky and was apparently not occupied. Test Units 3 and 4
were placed near the back of the shelter. Both units were placed to
determine slope of bedrock near the back wall, as well as possible
presence of burials or other special use. Unit 4 also tested extent
of prehistoric occupations identified in Unit 1.
Test Unit 5 was
placed on the bench in front of the shelter to determine use of this
area.
Test Units 1 and 2 are 1 by 1 meter in size; other units are 50
by 50 centimeters in size. Excavation was in 10 centimeter arbitrary
levels, except for separation of materials from Soil Zones 2 and 3.
Trowels and scoops were used to excavate matrix which was dry screened
through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Elevations for Units 1 and 2 were
measured from ground surface at the southeast stake, using a line
level and tape. The relative site elevations of these reference
points were determined during mapping using a transit. Elevations for
Units 3, 4 and 5 were also measured during mapping.
SPECIAL SAMPLES
Matrix samples, for fine screening, were taken from a 25 by 25
centimeter column adjacent to the southeast corner of Test Unit 1. A
quart poultry bag full of matrix was collected from each of seven
levels from ground surface to 60 centimeters. Levels 1 through 4 are
5 centimeter arbitrary levels, while 5 through 7 are 10 centimeters in
thickness.
Finer vertical provenience was used in the upper 20
centimeters to help define late occupations at the site.
DOCUMENTATION
All documentation and artifacts from the current project are
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Reports were
prepared for each unit level excavated. Notes also provide mapping
data for grid and unit layout, as well as for site mapping. A

25

photolog and field inventory of artifact proveniences were maintained.
Measured profile drawings were m~de of walls in Units 1 and 2 (Figure
5).
A Daily Journal summarized field
methods
and
findings.
Photographic documentation consists of 35 mm black and white prints.
Photographs of the shelter interior were taken using a flash.

ANALYSIS
Cultural materials recovered during the current investigations
were washed,
labeled and sorted by provenience into analysis
categories. Matrix samples for fine analysis were water screened
through 1/32 inch window screen. Fine screened materials were briefly
examined for kinds of materials present. Fine screen analysis results
provide additional assessment data.

SITE DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY
The shelter containing site 41TV933 is at the head of a slope
drainage which is part of the headwaters of Bull Creek. The shelter
opening is 16 meters in length and 95 centimeters in maximum height,
tapering to less than 35 centimeters at either end. In front of the
shelter is a bench which separates the shelter from the modern
drainage channel. The opening is oriented approximately north/south.
The northern end is downstream and is lower in elevation than the
southern end.
The interior of the shelter is semi-circular and reaches a
maximum depth of 8.5 meters in plan (Figure 4). The curved back wall
is stream cut and smoothed. The shelter floor slopes north to south
and from the back of the shelter to the front. Most of the floor,
especially in the southern half of the shelter, is covered by
limestone spal1s, leaves and twigs. A solution column with a base 50
centimeters in diameter occupies the center of the shelter interior.
Numerous small stalactites drip water from the ceiling onto the
shelter floor.

SHELTER HISTORY
The shelter is a remnant of a solution cave formed in hard
limestone.
Flowing water created the cave and shaped the back wall
and floor of the shelter. Solution formations were actively building.
The column in the center of the shelter probably formed at this time.
Fragments of formations recovered from the lowest soil zone are
additional evidence of early solution activity within the cave.

Spalls from the cave ceiling accumulated on the floor and were
redeposited by running water. These cave-derived materials (Soil Zone
3, Figure 5), occur as red clay just above bedrock in both test units
1 and 2.
The cave floor at the back of the shelter was apparently
bedrock.
Sometime after the collapse of the cave, alluvial deposits,
derived from upland clays, began to accumulate at the northern end of
the shelter. Soil Zone 2 (Figure 5) consists of mixed alluvium and
limestone spalls, which are stratified above the red clay in both test
units. Zone 2 contains the first evidence of human occupation.
Current data suggest these deposits date near the beginning of the
Late Archaic Period.
Alluvial deposition of very dark clay loam (Soil Zone 1, Figure
5) continued throughout the prehistoric period. At the northern end
of the shelter (Unit 1), these deposits are relatively spall free,
while those nearer the southern end (Unit 2) contain abundant spalls.
This suggests sorting of alluvial materials, with the downstream
portions of the shelter receiving more fine-grained particles. Soil
development within spall-free deposits was noted in Unit 1, where
surface soils are lighter in color and contain more sand. Limestone
spalls currently cover the shelter floor, including the northern end.

FINE-SCREENED MATERIALS
Types of materials identified during preliminary examination of
fine screened samples are similar to those recovered during screening
through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Chert, bone, mussel shell, charcoal
and small limestone fragments occur in upper levels. Fine-screened
material from lower levels consists of limestone fragments, with only
isolated cultural materials.

in Unit 1 (Levels 3, 4 and 5).
The primary evidence of this
occupation ;s between 25 and 35 centimeters, within the upper portion
of Soil Zone 2. Remains of the occupation were also recovered from
the lower 5 centimeters of Soil Zone Ib and the upper portion of Soil
Zone 2. In Unit 4, soils from excavated levels are similar to Zone 1
in Unit 1.
Possibly significant differences in types of cultural
materials present are noted between Levels 1 and 2 in this unit.
Level 2 in Unit 4 may be part of the earliest occupation of the site,

The lower occupation in Unit 1 consists of an apparent living
surface which includes Feature 1. A Marcos type dart point dates this
surface to the Uvalde phase (ca.
2250 to 1750 BP), the earliest
subdivision of the Late Archaic Period.
Although chipped lithic
materials are sparse, the ratio of tools to debitage is relatively
high. Bone is abundant and a high percentage is burned. Mussel shell
fragments are relatively sparse, but a whole shell was recovered from
the living surface.
Low numbers of lithic debitage characteristic of this earliest
occupation were also recovered from Levels 2 and 3 in Unit 4, together
with an Ensor type dart point. If these levels do indeed represent
part of a distinct lower occupation, the period of time represented is
expanded to include the Twin Sisters phase (1750 BP to ca.
1400 BP)
of the Late Archaic Period.
The upper occupation at site 41TV933 is restricted in Unit 1 to
the upper 20 centimeters of shelter deposits. Chipped lithic debitage
is abundant, but the ratio of tools to debitage is low.
Bone is
sparse and poorly preserved. Mussel shell fragments are relatively
more abundant. Scattered burned rocks, but not intact features, were
noted.
Abundant lithic debitage was also recovered from Level 1 of
Unit 4. No temporally diagnostic materials were recovered from either
Unit 1 or Unit 4 which might date the later period of occupation at
the shelter. The projectile point fragment from Levell in Unit 1 may
be from either a dart or arrow point. Current data suggests the upper
occupation includes all or part of either the final phase of the Late
Archaic Period or the NeoArchaic Period or both.

SITE EXTENT
Site 41TV933 appears to be limited in extent to the northern half
of the shelter interior (Figure 4). Test Unit 1 is in the approximate
center of the site near the shelter mouth.
Evidence of relatively
intensive occupation was also recovered from Unit 4, nearer the back
of the shelter. Units 2 and 3, placed in the central portion of the
shelter, were both largely negative. Unit 5, excavated outside the
shelter in an area of possible talus accumulation, was also largely
negative.
Estimated area of intensive shelter use is apprOXimately 30
square meters.
The site area, as defined, includes the interior,
north of the northern edge of Unit 2 to the northern end of the
shelter and east of the western edge of Unit 4 to the dripline. Use
may extend further west toward the back of the shelter.
Prehistoric occupation of the shelter corresponds to the extent
of relatively spall free clay loam. Southern and central portions of
the shelter, where abundant spalls occur, were not intensively used.

35

The southern portion is also wetter and has a sloping floor. Although
special use of this area cannot be eliminated, it appears unsuitable
for most normal activities.
Absence of occupation in the central
areas, where ceiling height is greatest and the shelter floor is flat,
is less easily explained. Although testing of the bench outside the
shelter was limited in extent, talus accumulations are apparently not
present in surface deposits.
Testjng results in Units 1 and 4 provide some indication of
differing activities between the shelter mouth and interior. Although
results are tentative, hearth construction may be limited to near the
she lter mouth.
Although each area contains lithic tools and debitage, bone,
mussel shell and charcoal, the relative abundance of lithic debitage
and frequencies of kinds of debitage differ (Tables 11 and 12).
If
the recovery in Unit 4 were multiplied by four (the number of 50 by 50
centimeter units in a 1 by 1 meter unit), 200 flakes and chips would
be expected in Level 1. This is much tigher than the 75 specimens
recovered from Level 1 in Unit 1.
Possible explanations for the
greater abundance of debitage in Unit 4, other than more intensive
lithic processing, include concentration of materials by water washing
and sweeping by shelter occupants.

Percentages of primary and secondary debitage are also higher in
Unit 4, and the percentage of interior debitage correspondingly lower
(Tables 5 and 6). Higher percentages of cortex flakes are usually
associated with primary stages of lithic reduction.

Preliminary examination of lithic materials for evidence of
burning (Tables 13 and 14) indicate a higher incidence of burned
lithics in Unit 4. The majority of specimens appear to have been
burned after tool reduction and deposition on the site surface.
However, thermal alteration as part of the tool reduction process
cannot be eliminated.

SITE SUMMARY AND ASSESSMENT
Site 41TV933 appears to represent a significant cultural resource
eligible for State Archeological Landmark status and determination of
eligibility for nomination to the National Register of Historic

37

Places.
A high information yield potential is indicated by the
presence of up to 55 centimeters of intact t culturally stratified
deposits. Site occupation is concentrated in an area approximately 30
square meters in size at the northern end of the shelter. The entire
interior of the shelter was intensively used, but possibly not the
bench in front of the shelter. Internal differences in use between
areas is possible.
The shelter was initially occupied during the Uvalde phase of the
Late Archaic Period, between 200 B.C. and A.D. 200. Use during the
following Twin Sisters phase, ending approximately A.D. 550, was also
documented. Still later occupations are present but were not dated.
Sufficient quantities of charcoal for radiocarbon assay occur
throughout site deposits. The Uvalde phase occupation can be dated,
but the potential of the upper site deposits is uncertain due to the
absence of definable associations. The abundance of mussel shell is
probably not sufficient to determine season of site occupation.
Evidence of hearth construction, tool manufacture and use, mussel
gathering and hunting was documented during current investigations.
Chert recovered from the shelter was brought in from some distance;
the nearest source is the Colorado River several miles to the
northwest. Mussels probably grew in the spring fed tributary just
down the slope drainage from the shelter. Both deer and smaller
mammals were hunted. The shelter is located at the interface between
upland and riverine environments and probably both areas were
utilized. The site appears to represent a seasonal base camp.
Site cultural stratigraphy appears
intact.
The
earliest
occupation consists of an apparent living surface which includes
Feature 1 and is clearly separated from surface deposits.
The
condition of later occupation is less certain. If Levels 1 and 2 in
Unit 1 represent a single occupation (Late Archaic or NeoArchaic) ,
stratigraphiC
control
is excellent.
If
they represent two
occupations, analysis must rely on statistical separation of these
occupations.
Horizontal integrity of the earliest site occupation is indicated
by the proximity of the Marcos type dart point and whole mussel shell
ty of cultural materials between Levels 1
to Feature 1. Basic si
and 2 in Unit 1 and Levell in Unit 4 indicate this occupation is
stratigraphically consistent over a major portion of the site.
Displacement of materials within specific episodes represented by this
occupation can be attributed to washing and probably shelter use.
Little evidence of animal burrowing was noted.
Tree roots are
horizontal and not numerous.
Site 41TV933 has the potential to provide specific details of
Late Archaic occupation of the headwaters of Bull Creek. Information
contained within the site can be integrated with an existing model of

38

local prehistoric settlement (Howard and Freeman 1984), as well as
regional models. Site 41TV933 appears eligible for State Landmark
status.

PROJECT SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Assessment testing at prehistoric rockshelter site 41TV933 was
conducted by personnel from Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
between December 10 and 12, 1984. Results of investigations indicate
a high information yield potential. During construction of proposed
Water Treatment Plant Number 4, the site should be protected as a
State Landmark.
If site 41TV933 is directly threatened by the
proposed construction, plans should be altered or the loss of the site
mitigated.
If the site is not directly threatened, but the integrity
of site information cannot be guaranteed due to increased visibility
and/or accessibility, the site should be preserved or its loss
mitigated.
