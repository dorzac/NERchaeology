Pre-reservation Period German Silverwork
of the Southern Plains Tribes
Ken Weidner’s presentation at the Panhandle Archaeological Society meeting on February 20th will examine the history and evolution of the use of Silver and German Silver ornaments used by the Southern
Plains tribes. It will use primary sources, historic invoices, museum examples, and actual silver artifacts
recovered from archaeological contexts. The principle focus will be on the pre-1874 period ornaments, not
the later, more elaborate silver, which flourished during the later reservation era. Early trade in sheet German Silver, tools used in metalworking, and the decorative techniques used will be discussed.
Ken Weidner is a farmer and rancher from Copeland Kansas. When he is not farming, you will find
him conducting historical research or making reproduction Plains Indian artifacts. His interest began in grade
school when he first began reading about the fur trade and battles of the Indian Wars. His main interest lies
with the Southern Cheyenne, but he also studies surrounding tribes, both friend and foe alike.
Ken has taken the hobby from simply reading to learning how to tan hides, bead working, silver working, painting rawhide parfleche, and many other craft forms. His specialty is making Indian saddles and horse
tack. By learning to actually make items, it helps him learn how they lived their life.
He and his friends also set-up tipi camps where they continue their search for answers. By wearing the
clothes, sleeping on buffalo robes, riding Indian style saddles, and eating the foods of the time period they
learn more than could ever be learned from a book. These Living History camps have led him to participate in many different activities, some of which include mounted battle reenactments against Cavalry, Infantry, Buffalo Hunters, and
Crow Indians.
Other activities include mounted buffalo hunts using
bows and arrows, butchering buffalo, games, dancing, etc.
This is his preferred method of learning, actually living the
part. One of his favorite recent events was setting up three
tipis and riding with his son Tate and three other friends at the
2009 Symphony in the Flint Hills.
Ken has been asked to help design and equip many
museum exhibits. Local museums in Kansas displaying his
work include Grant, Finney, and Scott County Historical Societies and Fort Larned National Historic Site. The Oklahoma
State Historical Museum and the Gene Autry-Southwest Museum in Los Angeles, California also has some of his art. In
2012 he produced two saddles for an interactive exhibit at the
National Museum of the American Indian in Washington D.C..
His experience with mounted battles has also resulted in being
in several films, including the Postman, Ride with the Devil,
Bloody Dawn, and Galileo (a German version of Myth Busters).

January PAS Speaker Paul Katz Presented a
Different View of the Coronado Expedition
During this season of political activity and its accompanying partisan divides, the Panhandle Archeological Society provided equal time for an alternative view of the famed and fabled Coronado Expedition. Attendees at the annual Studer Banquet were treated to a very scholarly and exceptionally wellpresented account of this expedition by Richard and Shirley Flint.
“Coronado Slept Here” was a humorous account of the Coronado
expedition, originally prepared in
1996 for a Plains Anthropological
Conference symposium in honor
of the late Dr. Clark Mallam. The
presentation is in three parts.
First, there is a review of the generally accepted details of the 1540
-1542 expedition [Figure No. 1].
Then, efforts by National Park
Service historians and archaeologists to uncover more specific details about the excavation are
summarized [Figure No. 2].
Lastly, we present the results of
our own research, based on the
appearance of the name
“Coronado” on street signs, buildings, and businesses of all types
[Figures No. 3, 4, 5]. The high
point of our research was the discovery of Coronado’s private journal, kept safe by his descendants
for over 450 years [Figure No. 6].
Among other facts, it proved that
Coronado never knew where he
was or where he was going [Figure
No. 7]. The presentation concludes
with a tribute to this unforgettable
failure [Figure No. 8].

searching for clues to the route of the

Chimney Rock Archaeological Area
Chimney Rock National Monument is a 4,726-acre site located in San Juan National Forest in southwestern Colorado which includes
an archaeological site. This area is located in Archuleta County between Durango and Pagosa Springs and is managed for archaeological
protection, public interpretation, and education.
The Chimney Rock Archaeological Site has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1970. U.S. President Barack
Obama created Chimney Rock National Monument by proclamation on September 21, 2012 under authority of the Antiquities Act. Its
care, protection, and preservation are shared by the Pagosa Ranger District, USDA Forestry Service and the public, who contribute
through tour fees, donations, and purchase of items from the Chimney Rock Visitor's Center. The Chimney Rock Interpretive Program,
managed and staffed by the National Forest Service and volunteers of the Chimney Rock Interpretive Association, conducts daily guided
walking tours and operates the Visitor Center during in-season, May 15th through September 30th.
The site was home to the ancestors of the modern Pueblo Indians 1,000 years ago and is of great spiritual significance to these tribes.
Their ancestors built over 200 homes and ceremonial buildings high above the valley floor, probably to be near the sacred twin rock pinnacles. Since the 1960's, Dr. Frank Eddy of the University of Colorado and others have studied the site, and research continues.
The Great Kiva was believed to have been built circa 1084 as part of the Chimney Rock settlement. Originally, it would have had an
adobe plaster exterior. It was rebuilt in 1972. The Great Kiva is chinked in comparison to lower structures
In 1921 J.A. Jeancon, curator of archaeology and ethnology at the State Historical and natural History Society in Denver, Colorado,
launched a field expedition to the Chimney Rock site. Occupation in the area is believed to date back to the Paleo-Indian, Archaic Period,
about 3,000 B.C. and carried forward through a number of occupations to the 16 th or 17th Century Navajos or Pueblos and then to 19th
Century Ute occupation.
