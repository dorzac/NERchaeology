Dear Ed:
Here is the report of a survey of the small reservoir on White
River.

Since the survey was made, the dam site has been moved

a short distance down stream and no one seems to know whether
any of these sites will be flooded.

Earl Green, at Texas Tech,

will go with Parsons soon to attempt to find out just what the
situation is.
Sincerely yours,

Charlie R. Steen
Regional Archeologist

The White Biver Municipal Water District which is composed
of Crosbyton. Ralls, Spur, & Post, Texas will construct a darn on
White River in the Southeastern part of Crosby County. The
project has been approved and we are now in the final engineering
specifications stage. Our engineers state that we will be ready
to let contracts soon after the first of the year.
The dam site was recently moved about three fourths mile
south and we do not yet have a new map of the reservoir. The dam
site will be located in the southeast part of Section ~96 H. & G.
N. RF. Survey, and will run north. The other sections that will
be partly covered by t~e reservoir will be sec. #101-l09-ll0-lll112-113-ll4. Only about 1800 acres in these sections will be in
the actual lake area. Your topography map would probably give
a vague idea of the land that would be under water.
Within the near future, we will have to topography map of
the area and will furnish you with one if you will let us know.
For your information, the estimated time to build the dam is
six months. The engineers estimate that it will take another 16
illOnths to fill the reservoir.

Any way we may be of assistnace to you, please do not hesitate

Yours verey truly
White River Mun&iipal Water District.

misinformation. the closest scrutiny was given to the area

just above the lake site, while the area to be actually
submerged was hurried through in order to mnke a rendezvous
with rrry pa.rents, who awaited me at the first public road to

be hs.d.

In addition, no survey has been made of the pipelines

to be dug to the various cities participating.

These :must

cross two streams in order to reach Post, one in order to
reach Spur, and two plus several playa lakes in order to reach
Crosbyton and Ralls.

The lakes are particularly promising,

as almost every one was an important water source on th.a
South Plaina.

This type of site most often yields early me.n

materials in this area.
Five of the sites are above the aotual
by the lake.

I think this is justified by the fact that some of the

of course, those not damaged or destroyed will .be m.ad.e accessable

However,

I expect to find sufficient material in the lake basin and

than none at all.
I h8ve included little mention of typologJ in the oonments

on the sites because there have been almost no typologioal
studies done in this area, and while some. points may fit into
groupings from other areas, I feel that to call a point by a
name might give the impression ot cultural contacts.

implications should not be made, even in such an informal
report as this, untill further and more conclusive work haa

been done.

Mr .. .Buzbee of Spur, abcmt•,.vhom.:Jane wrote you, told me
about two weeka ago that he had reoieved your letter and forwarded
it to the secretary.

I hope you he.vs recieved a reply.

All

I h!lvebeen able to find out is that the lake is defim tely
approved, that the loan.will come through the Federal Housing
and Home Finance Agency, and that construction may start within
nine months.
