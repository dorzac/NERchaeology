ABSTRACT
From March 1-15, 2013, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural resource
survey investigation of a segment of the proposed Park Row Boulevard right-of-way (ROW)
extension, in west Harris County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and
identify cultural materials, sites, or historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to
prepare management recommendations regarding any identified resources. The investigations
were conducted for the Harris County Improvement District No. 4, DBA Energy Corridor
Management District. The investigated segment ROW is located on federally-owned property
managed by the U.S. Corps of Engineers. The project was conducted per Texas Historical
Commission Section 106 guidelines, under U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston
District, Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) permit number DACW64-4-13-20.
The survey was comprised of two components: a general 100% pedestrian survey of the proposed
ROW APE, and the delineation of the site boundaries of 41HR1116 in areas outside of the APE.
The general pedestrian survey was conducted within the ROW APE from the USACE boundary
fence on the west to the artificial Langham Creek channel on the east. The intensive pedestrian
field survey of both the proposed APE and the area to the north included both surface and
subsurface (shovel test) examination (Figure 3; see Appendix 1 for details). A total of 121 shovel
tests were excavated; 76 of these produced 1224 artifacts from Levels 1-12.
The combined investigations conducted at 41HR1116 indicate that the site possesses the potential
for future study, and is eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.

INTRODUCTION
that contains the artificial Langham Creek
outfall channel for the Addicks Reservoir.
This tract measures approximately 800 ft
(ca. 244 m) in total width, and extends
approximately 1500 ft (ca. 457 m) from the
Addicks Dam in the north to the Interstate
10 feeder roadway in the south. The tract is
bisected from east to west by the proposed
Park Row Boulevard Expansion project
ROW which has a planned area of potential
impact (APE) width of 120 ft (36.5 m).

From March 1-15, 2013, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation of a
segment of the proposed Park Row
Boulevard right-of-way (ROW) extension,
in west Harris County, Texas.
The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials, sites, or
historic properties within the proposed
impact area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 1241) were conducted for the Harris County
Improvement District No. 4, DBA Energy
Corridor
Management
District.
The
investigated segment ROW is located on
federally-owned property managed by the
U.S. Corps of Engineers. The project was
conducted per Texas Historical Commission
Section 106 guidelines, under U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston
District,
Archaeological
Resources
Protection Act (ARPA) permit number
DACW64-4-13-20.

In addition to the APE alignment,
USACE required delineation of the
previously identified site, 41HR1116. The
western edge of this site had been identified
by the previous survey (Moore and Driver
2012). Located along the east bank of the
abandoned channel of South Mayde Creek,
only the portion of the site located between
the creek and the USACE boundary fence
had been delineated (Figure 2). Within the
current survey area, additional shovel tests
were conducted north of the APE to
delineate the northern extent of the site,
which was found to extend just over 100 m
north of the APE. After consultation, the
USACE determined that delineation to the
south was not necessary under the current
survey permit.

The project area is depicted on the
Addicks and Hedwig Village, Texas 7.5'
USGS topographic quadrangle maps (Figure
1). The project is part of the proposed Park
Row Boulevard Extension project, a large
development corridor that will extend from
North Eldridge Parkway on the east, to the
extant Park Row and Highway 6 intersection
on the west.
The proposed roadway
extension measures approximately 5000 ft
(ca. 1524 m) in length, with a maximum
ROW width of 120 ft (36.5 m). A previous
cultural resources survey has been
conducted in the majority of this alignment
(Moore and Driver 2012), which consisted
of privately-owned properties. Three
archeological
sites
were
identified,
41HR1114-41HR1116.

The intensive pedestrian field
survey of both the proposed APE and the
area to the north included both surface and
subsurface (shovel test) examination (Figure
3; see Appendix 1 for details). A total of
121 shovel tests were excavated. The
investigations were conducted by project
archeologist Randy Ferguson and field
technicians Greg Alliger, Tunde Babalola
Rachel Goings, Hannah Plumer, and John
Rich. Colin Poncho assisted the survey
crew as the cultural monitor for the
Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas. Roger
Moore served as the projectâs principal
investigator.

The current investigations are
focused on the remaining, unsurveyed
portion of the project alignment that lies
within the federally-owned USACE corridor

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Climate

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92ï°F (33ï°C), while
winter temperatures average 64ï°F (18ï°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).
Hydrology
The project area is located
immediately east of the abandoned channel
of South Mayde Creek, a tributary of
Buffalo Bayou and Galveston Bay. The
creek was rerouted to an artificial northsouth âLangham Creekâ outfall canal
located at the east of the current ROW
survey alignment. Extensive ground surface
disturbance, including soil truncation and infilling, occurred along the natural creek area
as part of the construction of the Addicks
Reservoirâs earthen dam, which was
completed in 1948.

The project area is depicted on sheet
89 of the Soil Survey of Harris County,
Texas (Wheeler 1976). The project area
contains a single soil type, Clodine-Urban
land complex (Ce).
Clodine soils are
described as poorly drained with very slow
surface runoff (Wheeler 1976:50). Based on
the PALM predictive model developed by
Abbott (2001), Clodine soils represent
upland loamy ancient (pre-Holocene)
alluvium with a low-moderate potential for
containing deeply buried prehistoric sites.
Urban land consists of soils that have been
altered or covered by buildings or other
urban structures, including: single- and
multi-unit dwellings, streets, schools,
churches, parking lots, office buildings, and
shopping centers (Wheeler et al. 1976:19).
Areas classified as Urban land have often
been altered by cutting, filling, and grading.
Based on the PALM map, the project tract is
described as Map Unit 4: No Survey
Recommended (Abbott 2001:156).

Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly

concinna) and diamondback terrapin
(Malaclemys terrapin) are also present.
Common lizards include green anole lizard
(Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard
(Sceloporus undulates), skink (Leiolopisma
laterale), broad-headed skink (Eumeces
laticeps),
six-lined
racerunner
(Cnemidophorus sexlineatus), and eastern
glass lizard (Ophiosaurus ventralis). Snakes
and amphibians are also present in
considerable numbers and diversity.

diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).
Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), eastern
mole
(Scalopus
aquaticus),
eastern
pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus subflavus),
eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), fox
squirrel (Sciurus niger), eastern gray squirrel
(Sciurus carolinensis), southern flying
squirrel (Glaucomys volans), pocket gopher
(Geomys breviceps), slender harvest mouse
(Reithrodonomys fulvescens), white-footed
mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), marsh rice
rat (Oryzomys palustris), cotton rat
(Sigmodon hispidus), packrat (Neotoma
floridana), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus
floridanus), and swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus
aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison) may have
been present on nearby grasslands at various
times in the past (Gadus and Howard
1990:15). Common turtles include eastern
box turtle (Terrapene carolina) and
Terrapene ornata, while snapping turtle
(Chelydra
serpentinia),

turtle
(Kinosteron spp.), river cooter (Chrysemys

An examination of 1915, 1949,
1955, and 1970 historical topographic maps
and numerous aerial photographs from 1944
to the present suggest that most of the tract
has probably been subjected to cultivation at
least in the form of disking for pasture
maintenance, and perhaps in association
with more recent tree farming.
It is
therefore probable that at least the upper 12
inches of most of the tract is disturbed. The
mixed forest surrounding the creek, in
contrast, seems to have remained present
over the entire period for which visual
documentation is available. We do not
doubt that many trees within this riverine
forest were harvested individually over time,
but it seems that there has been no wholesale
clearing of this forest, with consequent
implications of deep soil disturbance.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
6

Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

economic development of the county, and of
the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a
steady stream of settlers to the region. By
the second decade of the 20th century, the
growing gas and oil industry was competing
with agricultural interests, and helped create
a significant boom in population.

1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).
Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The project area lies close to the
historic community of Addicks, Texas. The
Handbook of Texas says, in part, the
following about that community:
Addicks, known at various times as
Letitia, Bear Hill, and Bear Creek, is
just north of Interstate Highway 10 on
the outskirts of Houston in western
Harris County. It was the railroad stop
for the Bear Creek community, which
was established around 1850 by
German immigrants who homesteaded
along Bear, Langham, and South
Mayde creeks. The town was named
after its first postmaster, Henry
Addicks, in 1884. In 1891, when the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad
was built, the town became a
commercial center for local farmers
and ranchers. Both the Bear Creek
community and the town of Addicks
were destroyed in the Galveston
hurricane of 1900.

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated

Creek channel in the 650 m wide strip
between the Addicks Reservoir embankment
and the Interstate 10 roadway. Three of
these sites, 41HR4, 41HR5, 41HR9, were
identified and investigated in 1947 during
the construction of the Addicks Reservoir
(Wheat 1953). Thirteen of the nearby sites,
41HR180, 41HR181, 41HR184, 41HR185,
41HR187, 41HR208, 41HR211, 41HR220,
41HR221, 41HR222, 41HR223, 41HR225,
41HR270, were identified in the early 1970s
by avocational archeologists (TARL
records). These sites were identified by the
presence of lithic debitage visible in looter
potholes or due to natural erosion along the
creekbanks. Except in the case of 41HR222,
no attempts were made to delineate site
boundaries
or
conduct
systematic
excavations. The presence of what appeared
to be a human burial eroding out of the
creek bank at 41HR222 resulted in limited
excavations to recover the remains (TARL
records). The bones were submitted to
TARL for analysis by Drs. Dee Ann Story
and Claude Bramblett, but were detemined
to be the remains of a large adult goat, that
had most likely been deposited during a
historic period flood (TARL records, letter
from J. H. Herbert to D. A. Story, March 21,
1973). The final four sites, 41HR1114,
41HR1116, 41HR1132, 41HR1133, have
been identified by Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc. during various surveys for
the proposed Park Row development (Driver
and Moore 2013; Moore and Driver 2012).
National Register testing was conducted at
41HR1114 and 41HR1116, which found
both sites to possess the potential for future
study, and thus be eligible for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places. At
41HR1114, data recovery excavations were
conducted, and analysis of the results is in
progress. The current investigations at
41HR1116 are designed to more adequately
delineate and assess that site in preparation
for data recovery investigations. Based on
the results of the initial survey in the areas
west of the USACE property line, the
delineation of 41HR1116 will result in
several of the sites that were identified based
on single surface observations being

From a more regional perspective,
South Mayde Creek is a tributary of Buffalo
Bayou. This bayou represents a major
perennial waterway within the Harris
County area and has seen extensive
occupations along its banks during both
prehistoric and historic times. Some of the
earliest archaeological investigations in
Harris County occurred along Buffalo
Bayou in association with efforts to
channelize the watercourse, and in
preparation for the construction of Addicks
Reservoir (Wheat 1953; Neyland and
Worthington, TARL site files). During
1947, Wheat (1953) conducted a series of
surveys and excavations (Fields et al. 1983)
of areas within the reservoir impoundment
zone and along the creek banks of several
nearby watercourses, including Buffalo
Bayou. During the late 1950s, Neyland and
Worthington,
two
local
avocational
archeologists, conducted surveys along
Buffalo Bayou in preparation for several
flood control projects (Prikryl 1997; TARL
site forms).
Following these early investigations,
extensive site location and recording efforts
were conducted during the 1970s and 1980s
by Leland Patterson and members of the
Houston Archeological Society (HAS). The
old channel of South Mayde Creek had been
examined in 1972 as part of a larger survey
conducted by Patterson and John H. Herbert
of HAS. This survey resulted in recording
of a number of sites within both privately
owned and USACE property along the old
channel.
No subsurface testing was
conducted at that time.
During
the
early
1980s,
archaeological investigations were once
again focused on the Addicks Reservoir area
(Fields et al. 1983).

(41HR826) and relocated two previously
recorded sites, 41HR109 and 41HR110. A
third previously recorded site, 41HR111,
could not be found, and was assumed to
have been destroyed during the 1970s by
channel construction. Of the located sites,
41HR109 and 41HR826 were identified as
potentially significant, and were avoided by
construction.

to have high probability for containing
cultural resources, an area totaling
approximately 36 percent of the 11,000 acre
reservoir (Prikryl et al. 1996:8-9). Thirty
nine new prehistoric sites were identified,
nine previously recorded prehistoric sites
were revisited, and 18 new historic sites
were located. The prehistoric sites tended to
be located on pimple mounds, levees, and
terrace remnants, and included Late Archaic
through Late Ceramic occupations.

A third project conducted in the
Buffalo Bayou watershed by Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc. examined the
confluence of Rummel Creek and Buffalo
Bayou in preparation for the construction of
a sewage line (Prikryl et al. 1997). The
investigations located a single new
prehistoric site, 41HR788. The site was
identified as potentially significant and was
subsequently avoided by construction.

More recently, three small-scale
survey projects have been conducted along
nearby portions of Buffalo Bayou by Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc. (Prikryl
1997, 1998; Prikryl et al. 1996). Two of
these projects focused on areas in
preparation for floodwater detention basins.
Prikryl (1997) examined 22 acres along the
bayouâs north bank, from Dairy Ashford
Road to Kirkwood Road. The investigation
located two new prehistoric sites, 41HR802
and 41HR803, and relocated one previously
recorded site, 41HR3.
Based on the
presence of intact deposits and a possible
feature, sites 41HR3 and 41HR802 were
identified as potentially significant, and
recommendations were made to facilitate
their avoidance during construction. The
light density of cultural materials and their
disturbed contexts resulted in site 41HR803
being ruled as having little potential
significance. Prikryl (1998) examined 48
acres along the bayouâs north bank, from
Kirkwood Road to Wilcrest Drive. The

Although several historic sites were
located during survey for the Addicks
Reservoir, none have been previously
located in the current project area (Fields et
al. 1983; Howard and Freeman 1983).
The final survey which should be
cited is one conducted for TxDOT for the
Park Row extension alignment itself. This
2003 reconnaissance-level survey by
Perennial Environmental failed to find any
archeological sites within the then-proposed
Park Row alignment, which is substantially
identical to the one currently proposed.

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
sequential shovel tests that were negative for
cultural materials. Shovel test intervals
varied slightly to avoid the disturbed soils of
the buried petroleum pipeline which cuts
across the tract just north of the APE.

The fieldwork was conducted in
from March 1-15, 2013.
The survey
consisted of a 100% pedestrian survey that
included systematic shovel testing and
visual examination for surface exposure of
cultural materials and site delineation of
41HR1116.

During the survey and delineation
investigations, a total of 121 shovel tests
(STs 1-121) were excavated (Figure 3;
Appendix 1). The shovel tests were placed
at approximate 10 m intervals on transects
located 10 m apart. Each of the shovel tests
were excavated in 10 cm levels and screened
through Â¼â mesh, and all the tests were
recorded and plotted on the project map.
The maximum depths reached by the shovel
tests ranged from 35 cmbs to 130 cmbs, with
an average maximum depth of 97.1 cmbs.

The project area is depicted on the
Addicks, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The majority of
the tract is densely wooded with a variety of
trees including oak, elm, and yaupon, and a
thick understory of grasses, briars, and ivy.
The survey was comprised of two
components: a general 100% pedestrian
survey of the proposed ROW APE, and the
delineation of the site boundaries of
41HR1116 in areas outside of the APE. The
general pedestrian survey was conducted
within the ROW APE from the USACE
boundary fence on the west to the artificial
Langham Creek channel on the east. East of
the artificial channel, the property within the
USACE tract consisted only of the steeply
sloped grade between the creek and the
USACE
boundary/electrical
utility
easement. The slope within the proposed
APE was visually examined but not
conducive to shovel testing. Three shovel
tests (STs 26, 28, 30) had been excavated in
the ROW APE along the utility
easement/USACE boundary fence during
the initial survey (Moore and Driver 2012);
all three were negative for cultural materials.

Many of the shovel tests revealed
the presence of imported fills that varied in
depth from 15 to 110 cm. The fill layer
tended to deepen as one moved eastward
from the fenceline, with 0-50 cm of fill in
the areas within 40 m of the fence, 50-75 cm
between 40-70 m, and more than 70 cm of
fill in the area from 70 m to the artificial
drainage. Most likely the result of largescale earthmoving efforts related to the
construction of the Addicks Dam
embankment and the spillway drainage, it
appears the fills were deposited in order to
raise the surrounding grade along the
channel and thus reduce the potential for
overbank flooding. Further, the lack of an
identifiable buried modern A Horizon in the
shovel test profiles suggested to the field
crew that some degree of truncation of the
modern ground surface had occurred during
the construction work as well.

The western edge of 41HR1116 had
initially been identified during the previous
Park Row Boulevard Extension project
survey in the narrow strip between the old
South Mayde Creek channel and the
USACE property fenceline (Moore and
Driver 2012). Efforts to delineate the site
within the USACE property began by
extending the shovel test transects to the
north. The location of the site boundary was
determined by the presence of two

The fills contained modern materials
(wire nails, rebar and all-thread rods,
railroad spikes, road gravels) as well as a
limited amount of lithic debitage. Once the
presence of a distinct fill layer was
determined, screening was only conducted
on the sediments from below the fill layer.
11

The 1 x 1 m hand excavation unit was
placed at the east end of the trench and
reached a maximum depth of 90 cmbs.
While analysis of this unit and recovered
materials has not yet been completed, an
initial assessment of the recovered materials
provided the following counts: one Ensor
dart point, one drill fragment, one scraper,
1476 pieces of lithic debitage, four faunal
bone fragments, and 49 fragments of burned
clay.

Of the 121 excavated shovel tests, 76 were
positive for cultural materials. As per
USACE directive, all non-modern cultural
materials were categorized and recorded in
the field and were reburied within the
backfill of each shovel test. The distribution
of shovel tests completed the delineation of
site 41HR1116 to the east and north from
the project APE. After consultation, the
USACE determined that delineation to the
south was not necessary under the current
survey permit. No new archeological sites
were discovered during the survey.

During the current survey, the 76
positive shovel tests produced a total of
1224 artifacts from Levels 1-12 (Table 2).
The recovered artifacts consisted of one
Kent dart point (Figure 4), one Carrollton
dart point (Figure 5), a distal tip fragment of
a dart point, a distal tip of a drill (Figure 6),
one scraper, one hammerstone, one tested
cobble, three cores, 10 utilized flakes, 1200
pieces of lithic debitage, two sherds of
Goose Creek plain pottery, and two
fragments of faunal bone. Few in number,
chronologically diagnostic artifacts are
limited to the Middle Archaic Carrollton
dart point (ST 72, Level 8), the Middle
Archaic to Early Ceramic period Kent dart
point (ST 22, Level 8), and the two small
pottery sherds that fall within the Early-Late
Ceramic periods (ST 81, Levels 6, 8).

41HR1116
The site lies on the east bank of the
natural channel of South Mayde Creek. It
measures 115 m east-west by at least 140 m
north-south, with its mapped area covering
approximately 1.4 acres (0.6 ha).
Initial work conducted at the site
includes the discovery and delineation of the
westernmost edge of the site in the private
property potion of the alignment to the west
of the USACE fenceline, and the excavation
of a backhoe trench and a hand excavation
unit in that same portion of the site. First
identified during the Park Row Boulevard
Extension project survey (Moore and Driver
2012), a total of eight shovel tests were
placed in the site, seven of which were
positive for cultural materials (Figure 2). A
total of 323 artifacts were recovered from
Levels 1-10 (0-100 cmbs). The recovered
artifacts included one unidentifiable dart
point fragment, one Goose Creek plain
pottery sherd, 24 fragments of faunal bone,
and 297 pieces of lithic debitage. In the
interest of proactive due diligence for future
regulatory requirements, the client requested
additional work be conducted to better
assess the cultural deposits. Subsequently,
a single backhoe trench and a 1 x 1 m hand
unit were excavated. The geoarchaeological
interpretation of the deposits revealed by the
trench (Frederick 2012) suggests the site
may contain two distinct components: a
shallow Late Prehistoric deposit at 30-40
cmbs, and a deeper occupation deposit of
unknown date at approximately 100 cmbs.

Based on the distribution of artifact
counts by shovel test, the portion of the site
located along the USACE fenceline, both
within the APE and to the northeast (from
STs 3 to 60) appears to represent the area of
the most intense occupation activity. This
includes the areas associated with the plotted
locations of previously identified sites
41HR184 and 41HR208, as well as the areas
across the fence where various excavations
were
conducted
during
previous
investigations (including ST 31, which
produced 174 artifacts; Moore and Driver
2012). This part of the site also corresponds
to the location of the extensive looter
activity present at the site. While this
evidence of pothunting disturbance was
noted in the site identification records from
the early 1970s (including 41HR184,
12

culture-bearing deposit located between
Levels 3 and 9 (20-90 cmbs). However,
after correcting the levels for artificial fill
depths (and ignoring potential surface
truncation), artifact densities are highest in
natural Levels 1-4 (82%). Interestingly, this
correction for fill depths places the
diagnostic artifacts in somewhat more
correct vertical relationships, with ceramics
in Levels 1 and 3, the Kent dart point in
Level 3, and the Carrollton dart point in
Level 4.

41HR187, and 41HR208), based on the
erosion of pit walls and vegetation regrowth
noted during the current survey, the looter
activity appear to have been discontinued for
some time.
The presence of the artificial fill
layer over much of the site is problematic in
terms of interpreting the vertical distribution
of artifacts. A straightforward plot of
artifacts by excavation level suggests that
the majority of artifacts are located in thick

Boulevard extension project, but delineation
of the site was limited to the westernmost
edge of the site located outside the USACE
property. The current survey determine the
site to measure 115 m east-west by at least
140 m north-south, with its mapped area
covering approximately 1.4 acres (0.6 ha).
While much of the eastern portion of the site
is buried under a layer of artificial fill, and
may have been partially disturbed during the
construction of the Addicks Reservoir dam
and spillway, the artifact-bearing deposits of
the site appear to be mostly intact, and
concentrated in the upper 40 cm of natural
soils. The artifacts present in the site
deposits can be categorized as high in
density and of medium diversity.
As
reflected in artifact counts, the intensity of
occupation appears higher in the area that
lies closest to the creek (fortunately, this
area also appears to be the least disturbed by
fills and truncation).

From March 1-15, 2013, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation of a
segment of the proposed Park Row
Boulevard right-of-way (ROW) extension,
in west Harris County, Texas.
The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials, sites, or
historic properties within the proposed
impact area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 1241) were conducted for the Harris County
Improvement District No. 4, DBA Energy
Corridor
Management
District.
The
investigated segment ROW is located on
federally-owned property managed by the
U.S. Corps of Engineers. The project was
conducted per Texas Historical Commission
Section 106 guidelines, under U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston
District,
Archaeological
Resources
Protection Act (ARPA) permit number
DACW64-4-13-20.

The possible presence of Native
American burials within the APE is a matter
of concern to all parties to this project.
While we cannot conclusively address this
possibility at the current stage of the
investigation, the excavations to this point
indicate that bone preservation within the
site is very poor. Only two small faunal
bone fragments were recovered during the
current survey. Preserved bone was also
extremely scarce and fragmentary within the
more extensively tested privately owned
portion of Site 41HR1116, which produced
four unidentifiable faunal bone fragments.
Given the widespread evidence of poor bone
survival due to natural soil conditions within
this intensively occupied site, it is less
probable that human remains, intact or
otherwise, will be found within the APE.
Further, as noted earlier, what had
previously been reported as a human burial
at the nearby site of 41HR222 was later
identified as a large adult goat that had most
likely been deposited during a historic
period flood.

The intensive pedestrian field
survey of both the proposed APE and the
area to the north included both surface and
subsurface (shovel test) examination (Figure
3; see Appendix 1 for details). A total of
121 shovel tests were excavated. While the
northern portion of prehistoric site
41HR1116 was delineated, consultation with
USACE determined that delineation to the
south was not necessary under the current
survey permit. No additional archeological
sites were identified within the tract.
However, four previously identified sites,
41HR184, 41HR187, 41HR208, and
41HR270, were shown to be part of a single,
large site. As these were all recorded on the
basis of limited surface exposures, with no
additional investigations or documentation,
we suggest they be subsumed within the
41HR1116 site designation.
Site 41HR1116 was discovered
during a previous survey for the Park Row
21

The
combined
investigations
conducted at 41HR1116 indicate that the site
possesses the potential for future study, and

is eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places.
