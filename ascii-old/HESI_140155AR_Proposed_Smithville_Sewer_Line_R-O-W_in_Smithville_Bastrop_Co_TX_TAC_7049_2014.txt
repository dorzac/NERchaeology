MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 15 and 27 October 2014, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), conducted
an intensive cultural resources survey of the City of Smithville’s proposed Smithville Sewer Line
Project in Smithville, Bastrop County, Texas (Project Area). The proposed project would entail
installing a new 8.0-inch- (in) diameter wastewater gravity line and connecting it to an existing
wastewater gravity line within the existing corridor of State Highway (SH) 71. The proposed rightof-way (ROW) would extend southeast from the intersection of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 153
and SH 71 in Smithville, Texas, crossing the Colorado River near the southeastern terminus of
the proposed ROW. The Project Area is located entirely within the existing SH 71 ROW and no
additional ROW acquisition would be necessary for this project. The proposed ROW measures
approximately 1.9 miles (mi) (3.1 kilometers [km]) in length by 10.0 feet (ft) (3.0 meters [m]) in
width. As such, the Area of Potential Effect (APE) totals 2.3 acres.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Smithville, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). As the proposed project is a publicly sponsored undertaking, the City of
Smithville is required to provide for a cultural resources inventory of the Project Area to assess
the project’s possible impacts on any cultural resources in the Project Area. Additionally, the
proposed ROW will span the Colorado River via horizontal directional drilling (HDD). Since the
Colorado River is classified as a Section 10 waterway under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899,
the usage of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) is required by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
in order to span this waterway via an HDD. Because a NWP permit constitutes a federal action,
the proposed HDD bore locations on opposing sides of the Colorado River within the Project Area
also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended. At the request of BEFCO Engineering, Inc., on behalf of the City of Smithville,
Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT
and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if the development
of the Project Area would have the potential to adversely affect any significant cultural resources
designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL)
or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The cultural resources
survey was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7049.

Management Summary

The survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials
were observed on the modern ground surface of the Project Area or within any of the 31 shovel
tests or 9 backhoe trenches excavated within the Project Area.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the
proposed sewer line will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as
or considered eligible for formal designation as SALs or eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon
therefore recommends that the City of Smithville be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed sewer line to the jurisdiction of the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. However,
in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and USACE should be notified
of the discovery.

Line Right-of-Way in Smithville, Bastrop County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was contracted by BEFCO Engineering,
Inc., on behalf of the City of Smithville to conduct an intensive cultural resources survey of the
City of Smithville’s proposed Smithville Sewer Line Project in Smithville, Bastrop County, Texas
(Project Area; Figures 1-1 through 1-3). The proposed project would entail installing a new 8.0inch- (in) diameter wastewater gravity line and connecting it to an existing wastewater gravity line
within the existing corridor of State Highway (SH) 71. The proposed right-of-way (ROW) would
extend southeast from the intersection of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 153 and SH 71 in Smithville,
Texas, crossing the Colorado River near the southeastern terminus of the proposed ROW. The
Project Area is located entirely within the existing SH 71 ROW and no additional ROW acquisition
would be necessary for this project. The proposed ROW measures approximately 1.9 miles (mi)
(3.1 kilometers [km]) in length by 10.0 feet (ft) (3.0 meters [m]) in width. As such, the Area of
Potential Effect (APE) totals 2.3 acres.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Smithville, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). As the proposed project is a publicly sponsored undertaking, the City of
Smithville is required to provide for a cultural resources inventory of the Project Area to assess
the project’s possible impacts on any cultural resources in the Project Area. Additionally, the
proposed ROW will span the Colorado River via horizontal directional drilling (HDD). Since the
Colorado River is classified as a Section 10 waterway under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899,
the usage of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) is required by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)

The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive cultural
resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas
Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Jennifer L.
Cochran served as the Principal Investigator for the project, while Jennifer Cochran and Jared
Wiersema conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 15 and 27 October 2014. This
entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts. The Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 subsurface probes
per 1.0 mi (1.6 km) for ROWs up to 100.0 ft (30.5 m) in width. As such, a total of 30 shovel tests
were necessary within the 1.9-mi- (3-1-km-) long Project Area in order to comply with the
TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating 31 shovel tests and
9 backhoe trenches within the boundaries of the Project Area.
The survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials
were observed on the modern ground surface of the Project Area or within any of the 31 shovel
tests or 9 backhoe trenches excavated within the Project Area.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of
proposed sewer line will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as
or considered eligible for formal designation as SALs or eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon
therefore recommends that the City of Smithville be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed sewer line to the jurisdiction of the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. However,
in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and USACE should be notified of the discovery.

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The cultural resources survey reported herein assessed an approximately 1.9-mi- (3.1km-) long proposed sewer line ROW in eastern Bastrop County, Texas. The proposed ROW can
be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Smithville, Texas, topographic
quadrangle (see Figure 1-1) and would extend southeast from the intersection of FM 153 and SH
71 in Smithville, Texas, crossing the Colorado River near the southeastern terminus of the
proposed ROW. The Project Area is located entirely within the existing SH 71 ROW and no
additional ROW acquisition would be necessary for this project. The proposed ROW measures
approximately 1.9 mi (3.1 km) in length by 10.0 ft (3.0 m) in width. As such, the APE for the
Project Area totals 2.3 acres. Overall, the Project Area is located within the prepared SH 71 ROW
corridor, and vegetation within the Project Area consists of short to medium grasses.
Photographs of the Project Area, including the general ROW, proposed HDD bore locations, and
the Colorado River, are provided in Figures 2-1 to 2-5.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in eastern Bastrop County, Texas, within the Post Oak
Savannah physiographic province, though the surrounding region falls within the Blackland Prairie
province (Gould 1975; Hatch et al. 1990). The Post Oak Savannah extends in a narrow band
from the northeastern corner of Texas southward to the South Texas plains. The southern portion
of the Post Oak Savannah is mixed with areas of Blackland Prairie (Hatch et al. 1990). The Post
Oak Savannah is characterized by moderately wooded, gently rolling plains with elevations
ranging from 300.0 to 800.0 ft (91.5 to 243.9 m) above mean sea level (amsl). Upland soils within
the Post Oak Savannah province tend to consist of sandy loam or sand, while bottomland soils
are sandy loam or clay (Gould 1975).
The Blackland Prairie is a narrow physiographic zone characterized by low, rolling land
that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red
River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area
of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and
streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are
associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between

uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer
rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in
others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone
in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life. Specifically, the
Project Area is situated on the floodplain of the Colorado River. Elevations across the Project
Area range from approximately 290.0 to 335.0 ft (88.4 to 102.1 m) amsl.
Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Colorado River basin and traverses
the Colorado River. The Colorado River flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and
the Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast
of Matagorda Bay approximately 120.0 mi (193.1 km) to the southeast of the Project Area.

2.3

SOILS

Geologically, eastern Bastrop County is a complex mosaic of Eocene-age, sedimentary
rock and sand formations (Proctor et al. 1974). Ten defined soil types are mapped within the
boundaries of the Project Area. These soil types are described in Table 2-1 (NRCS 2014), and
their distributions are mapped in Figure 2-6.
Regional climate has an effect on the morphology and formation of soil profiles in Bastrop
County (Baker 1979). Winters are not sufficiently severe in Bastrop County for freezing to affect

soil formation. Winter precipitation occurs primarily in the form of persisting fogs, drizzles, and
light showers, and the temperature of the soil remains high enough that microorganisms are active
at all times. Most winters, the surface layer of soil freezes only to a depth of 1.0 or 2.0 inches and
seldom stays frozen for more than 2 or 3 days. Throughout the rest of the year, rainfall is heavy
enough to cause some leaching; however, because the rainfall is well distributed, soils are
alternately wet and dry. When dry, clayey soils crack severely, and the cracks fill with water when
it rains, and clayey soils are therefore wet to a greater depth than other soils. On the deeper,
sandy soils, little runoff occurs. Rainfall is absorbed and drains through, and it leaches the soils
and alters the underlying parent material.

Aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in upland settings and within
deep alluvial sediments adjacent to drainages in Central Texas. Based upon the location of the
Project Area within the floodplain of the Colorado River, the potential exists for buried cultural
resources within the Project Area. Intact, buried archeological deposits may occur within alluvial
sediments like those present within the Project Area. Historic-age resources may be found in
virtually any physiographic environment.

2.4

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen, phytolith, oxygen isotope, faunal, and geomorphological data (Bousman
1998; Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995; Mauldin and Nickels 2003). While these studies
continue to refine models of paleoclimatic change, the paleoclimatic sequence of Texas still
contains significant gaps (Mauldin and Nickels 2003), and each data set presents unique
interpretive problems (Johnson and Goode 1994; Hall and Valastro 1995; Collins 1995; Bousman
1998).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change, evidenced by pollen
and faunal sequences, for nearby east-central Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period
(22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial
period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that
the climate in east-central Texas was considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen
data indicate that the region was more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later
periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic
deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the
deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and
Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to
have been more stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post
oak savannas. The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued
into the mid-Holocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more
mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985)
indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by
1,500 years ago.
Mauldin and Nickels (2003:16) recent summary of bison data (Dillehay 1974), Hall’s Cave
microfauna (Collins 1995), and pollen samples from Patschke (Camper 1991) and Boriak bogs
(Bousman 1998) suggests that the Late Pleistocene (ca. 18,000 to 10,000 B.P.) clearly marked a
transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that gradually grew warmer and drier followed
by a relatively mesic interval during the Early Holocene (ca. 10,000 to 8,000 B.P.). The Middle
Holocene (ca. 8,000 to 4,000 B.P.) is characterized as generally warm and/or dry with a brief
mesic period between ca. 6,000 and 5,000 BP. The Late Holocene (ca. 4,000 to present) is
characterized by continuing ameliorating conditions with a warm, dry period between 3,000 and
1,500 B.P. Interpretation of the paleoclimatic data remains somewhat uncertain, however, as
3 data sets suggest that the climate was drier between 1,500 and 750 B.P., whereas 2 data sets
suggest that a mesic interval has occurred within the last 750 to 800 years.

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Today, Bastrop County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas manifest
regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west
and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and
Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical
subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (cm) (32.0 in) and temperature
averages 19°Celcius (C) (67°Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the
warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier
periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30.5 to 63.5 cm (12.0 to
25.0 in), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to 127.0 cm (45.0 to 50.0 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall (Baker
1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 cm (36.0 in) of rain that fell within an 18hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9-cm (22.0-in) deluge
that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975). Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently
that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east
often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from
the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the
region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.5

BIOTA

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair
1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces
and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943). Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary,
characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes
through western Williamson County, northwest of the project area. Rainfall in the Texan province
is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite (1948) as a C2 (moist
subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and
hickory (Carya buckleyi). Fine-grain soils support the loblolly pine-oak woodlands dominated by

loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this soil
type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas include
the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies.
Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a series of peat and bog
marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties. The project area is
situated within the pine-oak woodland, which consists of loblolly pine and post oak woodlands.
The loblolly pine woodland is often called the Lost Pines, as the main body of the eastern
pineywoods is more than 160.9 km (100.0 mi) away (Baker 1975).
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. The
isolation of the Lost Pines contributes to the uniqueness of the biological community within the
project area. Several species of mammals occur in the project area, including Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), whitefooted mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), eastern woodrat (Neotoma floridana), Mexican free-tailed
bat (Tadarida brasiliensis), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon
lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), ground
squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana), pygmy mouse
(Baiomys taylori), and 9-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus). Both species of Terrapene
known from the Austroriparian province—eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T.
ornata)—occur in the project area. Lizards in the area include green anole (Anolis carolinensis),
eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates), and common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale).
Only a few species of urodele fauna are known from this area, including small-mouthed
salamander (Ambystoma texanum), and the Texan province acts as a barrier to urodele
distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west and the Austroriparian
fauna to the east. Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely
distributed species, including Hurter’s spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus hurteri), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), gray
treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea), North American bullfrog (Rana
catesbeiana), southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), and narrow-mouthed toad (Microhyla
carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the Texan into the Austroriparian
province include spotted chorus frog (Pseudacris clarkia), and Strecker’s chorus frog (Pseudacris
streckeri). Other reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include Texas (Black)
rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), brown snake
(Stereria dekayi), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western ribbon snake (Thamnophis
proximus) Texas coral snake (Micrurus fulvius tener), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans),
plainbelly water snake (Nerodia erythrogasterr), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis). Common
bird species include eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura),
field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture (Cathartes
aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos). Small herds of

bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, but these
species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14; SLPBS 2006).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located at the approximate boundary between Prewitt’s (1981, 1985)
Central Texas and Southeast Texas archeological regions. Prewitt (1981, 1985) demarcated the
southeastern boundary of his Central Texas Archeological Region at the town of Bastrop in
Bastrop County, which is located a short distance west-northwest of the Project Area. Previously
documented archeological sites in the vicinity of the Project Area are more consistent with those
known from the Central Texas rather than the Southeast Texas archeological region, and the
presentation that follows is therefore modeled on the archeology of Central Texas. The
indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North
America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time
in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian
bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and
settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central
Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There

HJN 140155 AR

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is
divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These include
the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points (i.e.,
Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which is
characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most markedly,
burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the Late
Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In addition,
the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute evidence
of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially accounts for the
lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin phase
sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to suggest
that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and lack the
ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas occurred in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca
crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay;
however, de Vaca did not approach the Colorado River basin or the Bastrop region. It was not
until 1691, when Domingo Terán de los Ríos led an expedition along the route that became known
as the Camino Real, that exploration of this region began.
In the late 17th century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began
migrating into Central Texas to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines and
missions and on Spanish ranches. At approximately the same time, horses stolen from the
Spanish had become an integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison
hunters of the High Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They
terrorized native groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to
flee, some into Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the region
encountered native groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the
Apache, and the diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. Their accounts,
therefore, do not provide direct analogues to prehistoric cultural patterns, but rather represent a
time of drastic cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns may have
prevailed through time. Large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic
affiliations and small, band-sized residential camps date to this particular period in Central Texas
(Collins 1995:386).
Historical documents dating from the 1730s to 1800 make reference to remnants of native
groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins 1995). Toward the end of this
time, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern Texas from the high plains. Records of
their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be highly biased since they are provided mostly
from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers (Collins 1995).
During the early part of the 19th century, the Native American presence in Central Texas
was composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung nomadic native groups (primarily
the Comanche)” (Collins 1995:387), with EuroAmerican settlers becoming increasingly common.
The Comanche presence began fading in the mid- to late 19th century. Their final expulsion
heralded the end of Native American presence in Central Texas.
In 1804, a Spanish fort was built on the Old San Antonio Road Colorado River crossing.
The self-proclaimed Baron of Bastrop, a German immigrant who had been given permission by
the Mexican government to settle near this crossing, established the settlement of Bastrop in
1823. Further attempts to settle the area failed until a new settlement was established by Stephen
F. Austin in 1827. Many well known Texas pioneers first settled in the Bastrop area. One of these
early settlers, James Burleson, owned a parcel of land that would become a portion of Buescher
State Park. The population of the Bastrop settlement at the time of the Texas Revolution was
around 400 individuals.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

The railroad came to Bastrop in the early 1870s and helped establish logging as the major
local economic activity. Iron, coal, and manufacturing became important industries by the late
19th century. By 1900, the population of Bastrop County had increased to 26,845, up from around
7,000 at the start of the Civil War.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Atlas) web site indicated the presence of 5 previously recorded archeological sites, 1 cemetery,
and 1 historic district listed on the NRHP within a 1.0-mi (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (THC
2014), while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer
indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review radius (NPS
2014). These documented cultural resources are summarized in Table 4-1, while their locations
relative to the Project Area are presented in Figure 4-1. No previously recorded archeological
sites, including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the Project
Area. According to the Atlas, the entire portion of the Project Area to the southeast of the
Colorado River and a small portion of the Project Area to the northwest of the Colorado River has
been previously assessed for cultural resources. These surveys, conducted by the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) in 1981 and 1986, produced negative results within the
Project Area.

4.2

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the Project Area on a
floodplain formation adjacent to the Colorado River, as well as several previously documented
prehistoric sites in close proximity to the Project Area, it was Horizon’s original opinion that there
existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the
Project Area.
In regard to historic-age resources, no structures are visible within the boundaries of the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map or on Google Earth. The lack of any
visible historic-age structures within the Project Area suggests a low potential for associated
historic-age cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

Horizon archeologists completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the Project Area on
15 and 27 October 2014. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing
and backhoe trenching efforts. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 subsurface probes per 1.0
mi (1.6 km) for ROWs up to 100.0 ft (30.5 m) in width. As such, a total of 30 shovel tests were
necessary within the 1.9-mi- (3.1-km-) long Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS.
Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating 31 shovel tests and 9 backhoe
trenches within the boundaries of the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through
0.25-in (6.0-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils
prohibited successful screening.
In general, shovel tests measured approximately 11.0 in (30.0 cm) in diameter and were
8excavated to a target depth of 3.3 ft (1.0 m) below ground surface, to the top of pre-Holocene
deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable. In practice, shovel tests were terminated at depths
of 3.9 to 47.2 in (10.0 to 120.0 cm) below surface due to the presence of pre-Holocene sediments
generally composed of clay and limestone gravels. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded
via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations
are presented in Figure 5-1, and shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.
In addition to shovel testing, the TSMASS require backhoe trenching in stream terraces
and other areas with the potential to contain buried archeological materials at depths below those
that shovel tests are capable of reaching (approximately 3.3 ft [1.0 m] below surface). The
proposed HDD bore locations that will serve to span the Colorado River were identified as having
the potential for deeply buried deposits. Although this USACE jurisdictional crossing will be
spanned with an HDD, the Colorado River is a Section 10 waterway as defined under the Rivers
and Harbors Act of 1899 and would require the usage of a NWP regardless of the HDD. The
TSMASS require a minimum of 16 backhoe trenches per mile for linear projects measuring 100.0
ft (30.5 m) in width. With this in mind, a total of 2 backhoe trenches would have been necessary
within this USACE jurisdictional area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 9 backhoe trenches, including 2 trenches within each of the
proposed bore entry and exit locations and 5 trenches on the upper terrace landform adjacent to
the Colorado River. The dimensions of the 9 backhoe trenches ranged from approximately 12.8
to 14.8 ft (3.9 to 4.5 m) in length by 2.0 ft (0.6 m) in width. The backhoe trenches were excavated
to depths ranging from 2.0 to 8.5 ft (0.6 to 2.6 m) deep. The locations of all backhoe trenches

were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and NAD 83.
Backhoe trench locations are presented in Figure 5-2, and backhoe trench data are presented in
Appendix B.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and
assessed in the field and placed back where they were found. No cultural materials were
observed during the survey, so the collections policy was not brought into play. Digital
photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials
were observed on the modern ground surface of the Project Area or within any of the 31 shovel
tests or 9 backhoe trenches excavated within the Project Area.

6.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the
Smithville Sewer Line Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources
designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as SALs or eligible for listing on the
NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that the City of Smithville be allowed to proceed with the
construction of the proposed sewer line relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT and Section 106 of
the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains
or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of
the discovery should cease immediately and the THC and USACE should be notified of the
discovery.
