MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: An Intensive Archeological Survey of US 80 at SH 352 in Dallas County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with shovel testing and backhoe trenching prior to proposed roadway and
interchange improvements and culvert replacements on US 80 at SH 352 near Mesquite and Sunnyvale,
Dallas County, Texas (CSJ: 0095-02-100).
The proposed widening and culvert replacement construction on US 80 and SH 352 would occur
primarily within the existing right-of-way. A total of about 3.5 acres of proposed right-of-way would be
required along the north side of US 80 and extend no more than 40 feet north of the existing US 80
northern ROW boundary. Approximately 1.5 acres of proposed ROW extending about 35 feet east and
west of the existing SH 352 ROW would be necessary north of US 80. The proposed SH 352 ROW
would include 0.44 acre corner clips in the northeast and northwest corners of the US 80/SH 352
intersection. Additionally, approximately 1.20 acres of proposed new drainage easement along Long
Creek north and south of US 80 would be required. The project would also replace the existing five
10-foot by 10-foot box culverts under the US 80 main lanes, frontage roads, and the span bridge under the
westbound frontage road at the Long Creek crossing with six new 10-foot by 10-foot box culverts.
The existing US 80 right-of-way ranges from 330 to 524 feet wide and consists of a four-lane divided
highway with 12-foot wide lanes, 10-foot wide outside shoulders, four-foot wide inside shoulders and
frontage roads. The existing US 80 eastbound and westbound frontage roads have two 12-foot lanes, fourfoot wide shoulders, and four-foot wide ditches. The existing SH 352 right-of-way is approximately 80 to
100 feet wide and contains a two-lane roadway with 12-foot lanes and no shoulders.
The proposed construction would involve the reconstruction of the US 80 main lanes to include three 12foot lanes in each direction with 10-foot wide shoulders and 60 feet of pavement for future HOV lanes.
The one-way US 80 frontage roads will have three to five 12-foot wide lanes. Proposed improvements to
SH 352 would involve the construction of four 11-foot wide lanes in each direction with a four-foot flush
median in the interchange area. Improvements to SH 352 north and south of the US 80/SH 352
interchange would involve two 11-foot wide lanes in each direction with an 18-foot wide median. The
Area of Potential Effect therefore is approximately 3,500 feet (east-west) in length along US 80 and
650 feet (north-south) in length along SH 352, a maximum of 524 feet wide at the US 80/SH 352,
interchange, encompasses a maximum of approximately 55 acres, and will extend to a maximum depth of
four feet below the existing ground surface for roadway widening and 10 feet for culvert replacements.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is located in east Dallas County between the Cities of
Mesquite and Sunnyvale, Texas. The study area is located on the Mesquite, Texas USGS 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 55 acres.
DATE OF WORK: 24 April 2007 and 19 March 2008

PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc., is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and subsequent amendments) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4422
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Based on extensive disturbances from surface and subsurface utilities, as well as a lack of
archeological deposits within the project area, Blanton & Associates, Inc., recommends that the proposed
construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the existing and proposed right-of-way without
additional investigations, as the survey discovered no archeological historic properties eligible for
inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places or sites eligible for formal State Archeological
Landmark designation. Further, as the proposed project area has been extensively modified by buried
utilities, drainage improvement, roadway construction and maintenance, and the upland prairie clay soils,
it is extremely unlikely that any archeological historic properties eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places or designation as a State Archeological Landmark would be discovered during
construction. If the planned construction should require additional work space outside of the existing and
proposed right-of-way, then additional cultural resource investigations in those areas may be necessary.

INTRODUCTION
On April 24, 2007, and March 19, 2008, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the
request of KBR, Inc. (KBR) and on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Dallas
District, conducted an intensive archeological survey of US 80 and SH 352 at the US 80/SH 352
interchange in east Dallas County, Texas prior to proposed roadway and interchange improvements and
culvert replacements (CSJ: 0095-02-100). The planned construction would occur along approximately
3,500 feet of US 80 and approximately 650 feet of SH 352 between Mesquite and Sunnyvale, Texas
(Figures 1 and 2).
The proposed widening and culvert replacement construction on US 80 and SH 352 would occur
primarily within the existing US 80 and SH 352 right-of-way. A total of about 3.5 acres of proposed
right-of-way would be required along the north side of US 80 and extend no more than 40 feet north of
the existing US 80 northern ROW boundary. Approximately 1.5 acres of proposed ROW extending about
35 feet east and west of the existing SH 352 ROW would be necessary north of US 80. The proposed SH
352 ROW would include 0.88 acre of corner clips between the northeast and northwest corners of the US
80/SH 352 intersection. Additionally, a combined total of 1.20 acres of proposed new drainage easement
along Long Creek north and south of US 80 would be required. The project would also replace the
existing five 10-foot by 10-foot box culverts under the US 80 main lanes, frontage roads, and the span
bridge under the westbound frontage road at the Long Creek crossing with six new 10-foot by 10-foot box
culverts.
The existing US 80 ROW ranges from 330 to 524 feet wide and consists of a four-lane divided highway
with 12-foot wide lanes, 10-foot wide outside shoulders, four-foot wide inside shoulders and frontage
roads (Figure 3). The existing US 80 eastbound and westbound frontage roads have two 12-foot lanes,
four-foot wide shoulders, and four-foot wide flat bottom ditches between the edge of pavement and edge
of ROW. The existing SH 352 ROW is approximately 80 to 100 feet wide and contains a two-lane
roadway with 12-foot lanes and no shoulders (see Figure 3).
Reconstruction of the US 80 main lanes will expand the roadway to three 12-foot lanes in each direction
with 10-foot wide shoulders and 60 feet of pavement for future HOV lanes (see Figure 3). The one-way
US 80 frontage roads will have three to five 12-foot wide lanes. There will be sloped medians between
the roadways and the edge of the ROW. Proposed improvements to SH 352 would involve the
construction of four 11-foot wide lanes in each direction with a four-foot flush median in the interchange
area (see Figure 3). Improvements to SH 352 north and south of the US 80/SH 352 interchange would
involve two 11-foot wide lanes in each direction with an 18-foot wide median.
Based on available construction schematics, the Area of Potential Effect (APE) is approximately
3,500 feet (east-west) in length along US 80 and 650 feet (north-south) in length along SH 352, a
maximum of 524 feet wide (from the north end of the project area on SH 352 to the south end of the
project area on SH 352), roughly 55 acres in size, and will extend to a maximum depth of three feet below
the existing ground surface for roadway widening and 30 feet or more for overpass columns.

Because the planned construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered
by TxDOT, the proposed project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now
subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary
conditions for recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that
any state agency must identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could
potentially damage those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Division of Archeology
administers the code’s provisions. Archeological surveys must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities
Permit issued by the THC in accordance with the provisions of the code. This project was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4422 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to consider the effects on cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are
federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states
that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion
on the NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by
federal agencies.
Protection of cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on
criteria defined by the National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Protection of archeological sites
under state law is tied to eligibility for formal SAL status pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. Federal and state
review of this project will occur pursuant to the First Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the FHWA,
TxDOT, THC, and the ACHP Regarding the Implementation of Transportation Undertakings, as well as
the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and THC. Field investigations were also
conducted in accordance with the PA and MOU.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council
of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all
cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential eligibility for nomination to the
NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural resources be located, make
recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as avoidance, preservation, or
further investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
Dallas County is located within the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic region (Fenneman 1931, 1938).
Topographically, the study area is nearly level to gently rolling. The climate of the project area is
characterized as humid subtropical with abundant and well-distributed precipitation (Coffee et al. 1980).
Long Creek and an unnamed tributary of Long Creek bracket the project area, with the unnamed drainage
near the eastern end of the study area and Long Creek on the western edge.
Geology of the project area is the Upper Cretaceous-age Ozan Formation (“lower Taylor marl”) that is
described as,“clay, calcareous, silt and sand increases upward…blocky…hematite nodules and pyrite
nodules; some very thin limestone lenses locally in lower part…thickness 500± feet” (Barnes 1972).
Soils within the project area belong to the Houston Black-Heiden soil association. Houston Black clay,
1 to 3 percent slopes, and Heiden clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes, comprise the majority of the soils within the
project area. Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is a deep and clayey soil that formed in situ from
ancient clayey marine sediments on uplands. A typical profile exhibits 52 inches of alternating very dark
gray to black clay strata overlying dark grayish brown clay at 70 inches below ground surface. Heiden
clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes, is also a deep clayey soil that formed in place from ancient clayey marine
sediments on uplands. In a representative profile, this soil exhibits dark gray to dark grayish brown to
grayish brown clay from 0 to 56 inches below ground surface. From 56 to 78+ inches, is mottled light
brownish-gray, olive yellow, and brownish gray shaly clay (Coffee et al. 1980).
East of SH 352 and along the unnamed drainage at the western end of the APE, the study area soils
belong to the Ferris-Heiden complex, 5 to 12 percent slopes, which consists of rolling clayey soils on
hillsides. Ferris soils are deep, sloping to very sloping, clayey, and formed in situ from ancient clayey
marine sediments on uplands. Along Long Creek is Trinity clay, frequently flooded, which consists of
clayey soils that formed in recent alluvium. A typical profile shows 45 inches (0 to 45 inches below
ground surface) of alternating dark gray and very dark gray clay overlying very dark grayish-brown clay
from 45 to at least 68 inches below ground surface (Coffee et al. 1980).
The project area lies in the Texan biotic province, which represents a transitional zone between the
eastern woodlands and the western grasslands (Blair 1950). The province has been divided into four
subregions: the Blackland Prairie and Grand Prairie of the Blackland Prairies region, as well as the Oak
Woodlands and Eastern Cross Timbers of the Oak Woods and Prairies region. The project area is located
in the Blackland Prairie subregion, which primarily supports tall and medium grasses such as little
bluestem (Andropyron smithii) and hairy tridens (Tridens pilosus) (Blair 1950). Land use surrounding the
study area is primarily undeveloped with a small parcel of commercial (gas station) property located at
the northeast corner of the US 80/SH 352 intersection.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to filed investigations, a review of data available on the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (TASA) and at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) was conducted to determine
the presence of any previously recorded sites or previous project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of the
study area. The review indicated that there are no prehistoric or historic cultural resources in the APE.
However, there are two previously recorded sites, two historic markers, one Neighborhood Survey record,
one historic cemetery, and one previous project area within the search area.
Approximately 0.4 mile east of the eastern end of the APE at the US 80/Paschal Road intersection, a part
of the previous survey corridor for the Forney Raw Water Transmission Line crosses US 80 from north to
south. During the survey, historic site 41DL349 and the Long Creek Historic Texas Cemetery (Texas
Historical Marker No. 13467) were recorded outside of the survey boundaries south of US 80. The Long
Creek Cemetery (DL-CO58) is about 0.3 mile south of US 80 at the intersection of Paschal Road and
Long Creek Road at the Long Creek Baptist Church. Graves in the cemetery date from 1855 to the
present day. Site 41DL349 is an historic (ca. 1850s) farmstead (J.R. Caldwell Farm) located about 0.25
mile south of the cemetery on Long Creek Road (Proctor 2000).
Approximately 0.5 miles north of US 80 on SH 352 near the community of Tripp is historic site
41DL405—the City of Sunnyvale’s city dump that potentially contains materials dating to the mid-1800s.
About 0.25 mile north of 41DL405 is the historic Tripp Baptist Church (Texas Historical Marker No.
13405), which began serving the area’s residents in 1882 in the local schoolhouse. By 1918, the first
Tripp Baptist Church sanctuary was constructed on its existing location and continues to serve the
community. At the intersection of SH 352 and Collin Road in Tripp are two historic residences (NRS7911296 and NRS79-11297) constructed in 1900–1910 that were recorded during a Neighborhood Survey
(TASA).

METHODS
Soils in the study area are predominantly upland soils that developed in situ and are not conducive for
containing buried intact cultural deposits. The project area has experienced extensive subsurface
disturbances (i.e., dense buried utilities, drainage improvements, and roadway construction and
maintenance) resulting in a lack of intact sediments. There is also no terrace development along Long
Creek. Given such conditions, B&A conducted an intensive 100 percent pedestrian archeological survey
with judgmental shovel testing and limited backhoe trenching on Long Creek.
Surface investigations consisted of an inspection of the ground surface within the existing and proposed
ROW, as well as the proposed drainage easements along Long Creek north and south of US 80. Shovel
tests were 30 to 40 centimeters in width and excavated with a square-head shovel. All sediments removed
from shovel tests were screened through 0.25 inch wire mesh. All appropriate shovel test data was
recorded on B&A shovel test forms and plotted with hand-held global positioning system (GPS)
receivers.
Excavated backhoe trenches were approximately five meters long, one meter wide, and 1.5 meters deep.
Following excavations, the archeologists cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts,
features, and/or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units in each trench were recorded and
described in detail on a B&A geologic profile form. Backhoe trench locations were plotted with handheld GPS receivers and all field investigations were thoroughly documented with digital cameras.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Intensive survey efforts discovered no cultural resources within the existing and proposed US 80 and SH
352 ROW and proposed drainage easements on Long Creek (Figures 4 and 5). Surface investigations
revealed that surface (i.e., transmission lines and fence lines) and extensive subsurface (i.e.,
telecommunications cables, water lines, and sewer lines) utilities occupy the majority of the existing US
80 and SH 352 ROW on either side of the roadways (Figure 6). The proposed drainage easements on
north and south of US 80 were located in what appeared to be relatively intact areas, except for an
approximately 100-foot wide North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) easement containing a
12-inch diameter, a 36-inch diameter, and a 42-inch diameter pipeline that roughly bisects, from east to
west, the northern one-third of the southern drainage easement (Figure 7). Roughly parallel to and north
of the water lines is a sewer line easement.
Subsurface investigations consisted of the excavation of 14 shovel tests (STs) and four backhoe trenches
(BHTs) to prospect for buried cultural deposits in the existing and proposed ROW as well as the drainage
easements on Long Creek. STs 1 and 2 were excavated in the drainage easement north of US 80 because
backhoe access was too difficult (Table 1). STs 3 and 7 through 14 were located in the proposed US 80
and SH 352 ROW north of US 80. STs 3, 13 and 14 were excavated in the proposed SH 352 ROW in the
northwest quadrant of the project area. Much of the proposed ROW in the northeast corner of the same
intersection is a paved parking lot (Figure 8). However, ST 12 was excavated at the northern end of the
proposed SH 352 ROW east of the current roadway. Shovel Tests 4, 5, and 6 were excavated in the
northern and southern margins of the existing US 80 ROW. Shovel testing yielded no buried
archeological materials only dense, compact, and moist very dark grayish black to grayish black clay
extending to at least 60 centimeters below ground surface. Deeper testing was considered unnecessary in
the upland clays that developed in situ as well as in the proposed US 80 ROW along Long Creek.

The proposed drainage easement on the north side of US 80 was thickly vegetated and the backhoe
operator wanted to avoid damaging his machinery’s hydraulic hoses so trenching was not possible and, as
described, STs 1 and 2 were dug there instead. Investigations within the proposed drainage easement
expansion on Long Creek south of US 80 involved the excavation of BHTs 1–4 (Appendix A). Except for
BHT 4, trench excavations revealed three to four silty clay stratigraphic zones between 0 and
160 centimeters below ground surface (Figure 9). Stratigraphy in BHTs 1 and 2 was almost identical.
Because of previous deep subsurface impacts to parts of the proposed drainage easement, presumably
during construction of the NTMWD water lines and adjacent sewer lines, BHT 3 consisted of a single
massive zone derived from the mixing of soils identified in BHTs 1 and 2. BHT 4 exhibited four zones,
the uppermost of which appeared to be a thin remnant of recent alluvial sediments (Figure 10). Trench
excavations discovered no prehistoric or historic cultural materials and revealed that there is no deep
recent alluvium in the APE along Long Creek with the potential to contain intact buried archeological
deposits.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive archeological survey efforts within the existing and proposed US 80 and SH 352 ROW, as well
as the drainage easements along Long Creek north and south of US 80 discovered no archeological
resources. Surface and subsurface investigations within the proposed ROW revealed dense upland clays
that developed in situ from ancient marine sediments that have virtually no potential for containing intact
archeological deposits. Backhoe trenching in the proposed drainage easement south of US 80 revealed no
archeological deposits, no terrace development remains, and only a thin drape of recent alluvium in BHT
4. In the existing ROW, the soils are disturbed from substantial surface and subsurface utilities, drainage
improvement, and roadway construction.
The above data suggest that there is little to no potential for the APE to contain previously unidentified
archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12). B&A recommends
therefore that because no archeological deposits were discovered within the APE, and the geology, soils,
and levels of disturbance within the APE are not conducive to the preservation of archeological deposits,
the proposed construction should not affect any SALs or archeological historic properties pursuant to 36
CFR 800.4(d)(1).
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional ROW for the proposed construction or future projects,
then additional cultural resource investigations may be necessary in those areas. In the event that
previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area
of discovery would cease and the TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental
discovery procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.

AN INTENSIVE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF US 80 AT SH 352, DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS (CSJ: 0095-02-100)

Appendix

Backhoe Trench 1
Zone
Depth (cm)
Zone I

0–60

Zone II

60–125

Zone III

125–160

Description
Wet, sticky very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay with a blocky structure and
abundant roots and rootlets; gradual smooth lower boundary; no artifacts.
Moist, very firm grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay with a platy structure and
abundant small (up to one centimeter diameter) calcium carbonate masses and
filaments (0.5 millimeters); clear evidence of bioturbation via roots as root casts
filled with darker Zone I soil noted; gradual smooth lower boundary; no artifacts
recovered.
Moist, very firm yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay with a blocky structure and
moderate calcium carbonate content (30%) throughout matrix; abundant root
casts containing Zone I soil; lower boundary not observed; old subsoil; no
artifacts.

Backhoe Trench 2
Zone I

0–67

Zone II

67–128

Zone III

128–160

Moist, very firm mixture of very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay noted as Zone
I of BHT 1 and moist, very firm yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay observed as
Zone III of BHT 1; crumbly structure due to mechanical disturbance with rootlets
common; clear and wavy lower boundary; upper part of Zone I has been
truncated; no artifacts.
Sticky grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay with a subangular blocky structure;
common iron oxide staining; evidence of bioturbation via roots with root casts
containing darker Zone I soil; occasional calcium carbonate flecks; gradual and
smooth lower; no artifacts.
Moist, very firm yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay with a blocky structure and
low calcium carbonate content (30%) throughout matrix; lower boundary not
observed; old subsoil; no artifacts.

Backhoe Trench 3
NA

0–150

This trench consisted of a mixture of Zones I, II, and III identified in BHTs 1 and
2. The disturbances are likely related to the channelization of Long Creek and the
construction of a nearby sewer line, the presence of which was only indicated by
two manhole covers; no artifacts.

Backhoe Trench 4
Zone I

0–25

Zone II

25–47

Zone III

47–135

Zone IV

135–160

Moist, friable grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt clay loam with a crumbly structure
and abundant roots and rootlets; clear and smooth lower boundary; unique to this
trench and is likely a remnant of Holocene alluvium; no artifacts.
Moist, somewhat sticky very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay with a blocky
structure; common rootlets; gradual and smooth lower boundary; this correlates
with Zone I in BHTs 1 and 2; no artifacts.
Moist, friable very dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt clay with subangular
blocky structure; moderate proportion (25% to 30%) of calcium carbonate in
matrix; pronounced root bioturbation; occasional rootlets; gradual and smooth
lower boundary; correlates with Zone II in BHTs 1 and 2; no artifacts.
Moist, firm yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silt clay with a blocky structure;
abundant calcium carbonate; pronounced root and insect disturbances lie other
trenches; lower boundary not observed; no artifacts.
