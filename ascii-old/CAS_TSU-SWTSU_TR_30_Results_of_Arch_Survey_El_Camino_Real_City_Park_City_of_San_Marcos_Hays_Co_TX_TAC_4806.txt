Management Summary
On February 19, 21, and 22, 2008, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State
University-San Marcos conducted an intensive archaeological survey of a 37 acre parcel of land on
behalf of the Parks and Recreation Department of the City of San Marcos, located in Hays County,
Texas. The City of San Marcos intends to develop the parcel into a public park space. The City of San
Marcos is receiving a grant from a state agency, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), for
this project, and is also a political subdivision of the State of Texas. For both of these reasons, the City of
San Marcos is required to comply with the Texas Antiquities Code. The Texas Antiquities Code states
that all such undertakings that are funded by or conducted on lands owned by political subdivisions
of the state should be preceded by cultural resource surveys to ensure that no sites, buildings, or
monuments that are important to local or state history will be negatively impacted by the proposed
developments. Fieldwork was carried out by Jon C. Lohse, who served as Principal Investigator, David
M. Yelacic, who served as the Project Archaeologist, J. Drew Sitters, and C. Britt Bousman, who
served as Project Geoarchaeologist, under the Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4806.
A total of 25 shovel tests and two backhoe trenches were excavated and recorded across the 37
acre parcel. Two of the 25 shovel tests contained evidence of cultural materials; each yielded a single
fragment of a chert flake. Additional shovel tests were excavated immediately adjacent to these two
positive probes, but no additional remains were identified. Accordingly, these finds are not considered
to be indicative of buried archaeological deposits but are considered as isolated finds that could very
well have been deposited by flooding of Cottonwood Creek. Based on these results, CAS concludes that
the project area does not contain cultural properties or resources considered significant to the city’s,
state’s, or nation’s history. It is recommended that the City be granted permission to proceed with the
development of this land for public park space.

Introduction

The archaeological survey was designed to
discover any cultural resources that might be
present in the project area and to evaluate their
potential significance in terms of local, state,
or national history. Cultural resources located
on land owned or controlled by the State or
its political subdivisions are protected by the
Code, which identifies significant sites as State
Archeological Landmarks (SAL). Should any
historic or prehistoric sites identified in the
project area be determined eligible for formal
designation of landmark status, some measure
of protection or mitigation of impact may be
necessary. Worthiness for designation as a SAL
is defined in the Code:

This report provides a description of an
intensive archaeological survey performed by
the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS),
Texas State University-San Marcos, on behalf of
the Parks and Recreation Department of the City
of San Marcos (City), located in Hays County,
Texas. The City is planning to develop a 37 acre
parcel of city-owned land into a public park
space. The land proposed for this park is currently
green space; no development or construction
occupies this area. The City is receiving funds
for this development from the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department (TPWD) in the form of a
Recreational Trails Grant, and is also providing
a portion of the funding for the project from its
own budget.

Archeological sites may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as
State Archeological Landmarks, provided that
at least one of the following conditions is met
(Rules and Practice, Chapter 41:10):

According to the City’s plans, the park
will include approximately 5,060 linear feet of
unpaved walking trails, mileage marks at ¼ mile
intervals, and interpretive displays. After trails
are constructed, the City intends to add other
recreational facilities including pavilions, picnic
tables, playgrounds, and a half-court basketball
court. All of these additions will be designed
to have minimal impact to the existing green
space; impacts from all developments, including
paved surfaces for playground areas and the like,
are projected to be shallow or near-surface in
nature.

The archeological site is situated on land
owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one
of its political subdivisions; (and then)
(A) preservation of materials must be
sufficient to allow application of standard
archeological techniques to advantage; and/or
(B) the majority of artifacts are in place
so that a significant portion of the site’s
original characteristics can be defined through
investigations; and/or

The use of funds issued from State of Texas
government agencies, as well as the City’s standing
as a political entity within the state, means that
this development is subject to provisions of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Code). The Code
requires that these and similar developments
be preceded by archaeological assessments to
determine the presence and potential nature of
cultural resources that would be impacted by
proposed developments.

(C) the site has the potential to contribute
to cumulative cultural history by the addition of
new information; and/or
(D) the site offers evidence of unique or rare
attributes; and/or

(E) the site offers a unique or rare
opportunity to test techniques, theory, or method

knowledge.

(Blackland) Prairie of Texas (Spearing 1991). The
project area is also immediately adjacent to the
Balcones Escarpment, which marks the abrupt
boundary between the uplifted Edwards Plateau
and the Black Prairie. Ecotonal zones such as
this one, comprising transitions between two
adjoining large-scale environmental provinces,
are understood as high-energy settings capable of
supporting tremendous diversity in terms of plant
and animal species (Crumley 1994). Accordingly,
they also represent likely areas for supporting
dense human occupations during both historic
and prehistoric times.

Because of the project area setting along
Cottonwood Creek in the watershed of the San
Marcos River, it is considered a high probability
area for the presence of cultural remains. To
assist the City with their regulatory compliance
obligations, CAS conducted this survey under
Texas Antiquities Permit 4806 in accordance with
the guidelines for archaeological survey set forth
by the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA)
and adopted by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC). The investigations consisted of a literature
review and site file search for previously recorded
sites in and around the project area, and included
an intensive pedestrian survey with subsurface
testing within the project area boundaries. All
work was carried out in accordance with the
standards of the CTA and THC.

Soils
The proposed project area is entirely within
the Heiden-Houston Black region described by
Batte (1984); these are deep, gently sloped soils
over clay and shale on the uplands of the Black
Prairie. A majority of the project area, along the
banks of Cottonwood Creek and its immediate
flood plains, is Tinn Clay (Tn). Tinn Clays are
calcareous, clayey alluvial deposits and consist
of deep, poorly drained, nearly level soils. The
surface layer is made up of dark gray clay about
25 inches thick and overlies a 55 inch thick layer
of grayish brown clay. The remaining portion of
the project area is on an elevated T1 terrace of
Cottonwood Creek, and is composed of Houston
Black clay (HoB), which is found along the gentle
slopes in the uplands of the Black Prairie. This
soil is moderately well drained with an upper
layer of very dark gray clay about 50 inches thick
sitting atop a deeper layer of grayish brown clay
about 30 inches thick. Houston Black clays build
up slowly through colluvial processes and they
are susceptible to slope creep or solifluction.
The project area’s soils were examined by CAS
geoarchaeologist, Dr. C. Britt Bousman, and will
be discussed in the results section.

This report defines the project area, describes
the methods used in gathering information,
presents the results of the survey, and offers
recommendations on the development of this
proposed public park space by the City. The survey
was performed by the Principal Investigator,
Jon C. Lohse, and CAS archaeologists, C. Britt
Bousman, J. Drew Sitters, and David M. Yelacic
on February 19, 21, and 22, 2008.

able to sustain, and as previously mentioned,
the ecotonal zone in which this project area is
located could potentially support a wide range of
life. As described by Dalton Merz, Hays County
provides a habitat for a wide spectrum of wildlife
(Batte 1984). The principal species are deer,
turkey, squirrel, bobwhite quail, dove, rabbit, and
many non-game birds and animals including fox,
raccoon, ringtail cat, skunk, opossum, bobcat,
beaver, nutria, and coyote. The waterways of the
San Marcos River watershed are home to several
important fish species including black bass, white
bass, channel catfish, yellow catfish, crappie, and
sunfish (Batte 1984).

A majority of the project area surrounding
Cottonwood Creek appears to be relatively
undisturbed in recent times. On the banks of the
creek and the floodplain, there were tall grasses,
reeds, and scattered deciduous trees including
Sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), Ash (Fraxinus
texensis), Osage Orange (Maclura pomifera),
Anaqua (Ehretia anaca), and a few unidentifiable
species (Brockman 1968). Moving up the slope to
the T1 terrace, vegetation became denser with a
thick ground cover of tall grasses, scattered cacti,
and an abundance of Sugarberry, Anaqua, and
Mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) trees of varying
sizes (Figure 2). A small portion of the site was
within a pasture in which there were absolutely
no trees (Figure 3). Tall grass thickly covered this
landscape.

Economy
The predominant economic activity in the
county is agriculture, including cotton and
grain sorghum. The nearly level pasture lands
are ideally suited for farming as well as grazing
livestock. The current project area in particular is
believed to have never been seriously disturbed
by modern or historic activities. However, tracts

The following are descriptions

In 1997, Paul Price and

behalf of the Guadalupe-Blanco
River Authority for the San
Marcos Raw Water Pipeline and
recorded site 41HY279 (Prikryl
1997). The site survey form for
41HY279, accessed on the THC
Atlas Database, records a lithic
scatter of an undetermined
prehistoric age approximately
one kilometer east-northeast of
the project area. No diagnostic
artifacts were present, but one
chert cobble that was 80%
bifacially worked, and a late stage
biface failure were observed
and recorded. No further

recorded as a mid-20th century farmstead. The
recorder describes the site, as documented on the
THC Site Atlas Database, as being composed of a
bulldozed house, a standing barn, trash piles, and
a well/cistern. The bulldozed house is represented
by a light scatter of historic debris (glass, pottery
and metal) adjacent to what appears to be piers,
posts, and dimensional lumber with wire nails.
The well/cistern is represented by a slight
depression in the landscape, 6 feet in diameter,
which is surrounded by dead trees. The standing
barn, which seems to be in use still, is made from
corrugated iron held in place by a wooden frame,
and it includes a grain box, posts, and a feeder.
The site was not considered eligible for NRHP or
SAL designation.

windmill, and plowed fields. The fields contained
numerous artifacts dating from the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. The structure seemed to
be made of some materials that predated others,
suggesting that there was an earlier structure in
the vicinity. Jones recommended that archival
research should be done to determine whether
or not the site could be considered eligible for
NRHP and/or SAL designation.
In 2004, Paul Price and Associates recorded
another site, 41HY385, within a one kilometer
radius of the current project area (ca. one kilometer
west-southwest of the current project area)
(Weaver 2004). According to the technical report
of the survey’s results, 41HY385 was located on
1951 and 1965 ASCS aerial photographs before
the fieldwork began. The aerial photographs
showed a historic farmstead which included
three structures. Field investigations of the site
revealed that there were no longer any intact
structures; all three had been reduced to a large
pile (ca. 25 feet in diameter) of lumber, corrugated
metal, metal debris, tires, and other house debris.
Weaver (2004:17) suggested that perhaps some of
the structures were moved to another location.
41HY385 was officially recorded as the remnants
of a mid-20th century farmstead, and no further
work was recommended. The site was ineligible
for NRHP and SAL.

The 2002 survey of the Cottonwood Creek
Wastewater Interceptor Survey by CAS, Texas
State University-San Marcos, led to the discovery
of three sites, one of which, 41HY337, is within
one kilometer of the current project area (Jones
and Oksanen 2006). This site was just outside of
the survey area and on private property, therefore,
it was not included in the technical report although
it was recorded by Richard S. Jones on the THC
Site Atlas Database. The site is approximately
750 m northwest of the current project area and
was recorded as being a historic farmstead. The
site was composed of a 7-x-7-m structure, a
limestone-lined well, an Aermotor of Chicago Co.
?

An intensive archaeological survey of the
proposed Farm to Market Road 110 corridor
in 2005 through 2006 by PBS&J revealed four
more sites within the one kilometer radius of the
current project area (Rogers et al. 2007). The
four sites form a cluster, approximately 300 m
in diameter, with the site farthest to the west,
41HY407, located about one kilometer west
of the current project area. According to the
technical report of the survey’s results, 41HY407
was a lithic procurement site of approximately
25 m in diameter. The small amount of lithic
debitage represented a variety of stages in lithic
reduction, suggesting that perhaps a tool may
have been completed or nearly completed at the
site. The absence of features, diagnostic artifacts,
subsistence remains, and stratigraphic integrity
show no evidence of an encampment (Rogers
et al. 2007). This site was not recommended for
further work, nor was it considered eligible for
NRHP or SAL.

al. 2007). The artifacts observed in the subsurface
testing of the site support the several different,
historic occupational episodes of this site. No
further work was recommended, and the site was
not considered to be eligible for NRHP of SAL.
41HY401 was recorded as a lithic procurement
site. The tested chert cobbles, a utilized flake
fragment, and a single chert flake represent
different stages in the lithic reduction process,
which suggests the possibility of some tool
manufacturing taking place at this site (Rogers
et al. 2007). The absence of features, temporally
diagnostic artifacts, subsistence remains, and
stratigraphic integrity show no evidence of an
encampment. No further work was recommended
and the site was not considered eligible for NRHP
or SAL.

Research Design and Methods
The current archeological investigation
consisted of a 100 percent systematic, intensive
pedestrian survey, which included subsurface
testing within the project area boundaries.
Because the City’s intended public park space
is located in the San Marcos River Watershed,
the land is considered a high probability area for
containing archaeological sites. As mandated by
the minimum survey standards adopted by the
THC for project areas of this size, no less than
one shovel test for every two acres is required.
CAS evenly spaced and excavated 20 shovel tests
across the 37 acre parcel, and an additional 5 were
excavated in order to delineate two shovel tests
(STs 10 and 11) that contained cultural material
(Figure 4).

41HY400 was recorded as a house site or
a farmstead dating to the late 19th and early
20th centuries. A map from 1911 and an aerial
photograph from 1938 both showed structures
on this site. While the artifacts observed in the
subsurface testing dated to the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, no structures remained
(Rogers et al. 2007). This site was not considered
eligible for NRHP or SAL, and no further work
was recommended. Similar to 41HY400, the
review of a 1911 map and 1938 aerial photograph
showed that structures once existed at the site of
41HY395, but field work revealed that there were
no longer any intact structures. Two concrete
slabs were visible at the surface but were deemed
the remnants of modern livestock pens. A capped
well was associated with the two concrete slabs.
A wooden foundation visible at the surface in
the southern portion of the site was described as
being the remnants of outbuildings associated
with the earlier occupation of the site (Rogers et

Each shovel test, approximately 30 cm in
diameter, was excavated in 20 cm arbitrary levels
to a maximum depth of ~75 cmbs (centimeters
below surface). All of the excavated sediment
was passed through a ¼ inch hardware screen
and if artifacts were present, they were collected

Marcos.

in 4 mil bags. Artifacts were labeled with the
corresponding level’s provenience, described, and
then placed in the shovel test pit at the completion
of the excavation. Observations and comments
pertaining to each probe were recorded by the
excavator. Once all excavations were complete,
the shovel test pits were back filled.

The backhoe profile descriptions follow
a modified system based on approaches that
integrate the methods of soil science (Soil Survey
Staff 1993) and sedimentary geology (Reineck
and Singh 1975). This system records both soil
horizon information and geological deposit
information. A coding guide was developed for
this purpose and is provided below (Table 2). The
approach uses the concept of a zone, which is
either a distinct soil horizon (e.g., A, B, C, etc)
or a distinct geological deposit (bed or lamina)
that represents homogeneous characteristics with
recognizable top and bottom boundaries. Zones
classified in terms of sedimentary structures
are believed to have formed primarily from
depositional processes, while zones classified
by soil horizons/structures are believed to have
formed from weathering processes. Sediment/
soil color, sediment/soil texture, sediment/soil

Additionally, given the floodplain setting and
the potential depth of deposits, CAS excavated
two backhoe trenches spaced evenly across the
survey area. One trench, BHT 1, was located on
the T1 terrace north of Cottonwood Creek, and the
other, BHT 2, was excavated on the T0 floodplain,
also north of the creek. These trenches allowed
CAS archaeologists to examine the project area
for deeply buried cultural deposits and to gain a
better understanding of the geomorphic setting
of the project area.

structure, inclusions, and zone boundaries were
recorded for each zone. Interpretations as to
whether the zone was a geological bed/lamina or
a soil horizon were made in the field and refined
by review of the recorded data. We assigned soil
horizon designations to sediment zones in the field
or later in the lab. Soil horizon and depositional
unit designations follow the Soil Survey Staff
(1993) classifications.

In terms of cultural material recovered from
subsurface probes, only Shovel Tests 10 and
11 were positive while the remaining 23 were
devoid of any artifact content. In the following
paragraphs, the negative shovel tests will be
briefly described in groups according to their
location on the landscape; the positive shovel
tests will be described individually. Results from
all shovel tests are presented in Appendix A.
First, we present the results from the geomorphic
study of the profiles exposed in excavating the
backhoe trenches.

Results
The project area was polygonal in shape and
included Cottonwood Creek and its banks, the
immediate floodplain, a small portion of a pasture
that was in the floodplain, and a small portion of
the T1 terrace. The project area was thoroughly
surveyed in order to determine the presence of
subsurface deposits. This was accomplished by
excavating 20 evenly spaced shovel tests and two
evenly spaced backhoe trenches. An additional
five shovel tests were excavated in order to
delineate two positive shovel tests. Overall,
surface visibility was moderate to poor due to
a dense ground cover of tall grass, reeds, small
trees, organic litter, and modern garbage. There
was no prehistoric cultural material visible on
the ground anywhere within the project area
boundaries.

Trench Results
Two backhoe trenches were excavated in
the survey area. The first was excavated on a
T1 terrace on the left bank (east) of Cottonwood
Creek. The sediments in BHT 1 (Table 3)
consist of a surface A horizon composed of dark
clay loam that sits on a gravel bed. The gravel
bed sits unconformably on a truncated much
older terrace deposit with a high percentage of
calcium carbonate accumulated as poorly formed
soft nodules. This lower deposit might be an

Shovel Test Results

a small truncated T2 terrace or a small outlier of
the Leona Formation.

The first eight shovel tests, STs 1-8, were all
located on the west side of Cottonwood Creek.
This portion, running the length of the project
area, was a thin strip of floodplain (<50 m wide)
between a pasture to the west and the creek to
the east. None of these probes contained any
cultural material; there were also similarities in
poor surface visibility, slight root disturbance
and rootlets in the top 20 cm, black clay with
increasing compactness and dryness with depth,
and scattered rocks and gravel throughout. Shovel
Test 6 is an exception; here, a dense concentration
of chert gravels was encountered beginning at
~30 cmbs.

BHT 2 was excavated on the edge of the
modern floodplain in the T0 terrace on the left
bank of Cottonwood Creek. These deposits
represent recent floodplain alluvium from the
creek. The nature and degree of soil structure
and preserved sedimentary structures suggest
that these are intact deposits that probably date
to the Late Holocene (Table 4). Although these
deposits have the potential to contain prehistoric
archaeological materials, none were observed.
The sediments in Zone 1 in BHT 1 are likely the
same sedimentary unit that forms the deposits in
BHT 2, and the BHT 1 Zone 1 sediments likely
represent high flood events that overlap the higher
terrace deposits. The gravel bed that composes
Zone 2 in BHT 1 represents a widespread erosion
event as these gravels were observed eroding out
of this deposit throughout the entire project area.

On the east side of Cottonwood Creek, STs
14, 17-19 and 22-25 were also excavated on the
floodplain, but there was more variation in the
landscape. Shovel Tests 14 and 18 were located in
a lightly wooded area within 10 m of the creek.

These two shovel tests had poor surface visibility,
roots and rootlets in the top 40 cm, increasing
compactness with depth, an absence of rocks, and
a sediment change at ~40-50 cm; the sediment
changed from compact, black clay to black clay
mottled with light brown sand. Shovel Tests 17
and 19 were in the same lightly wooded area of
the flood plain but they were within 5 m of the
T1 terrace slope foot. The location of these two
shovel tests had relatively good surface visibility,
moist and compact black clay, and light gravels
throughout. The remaining three shovel tests
on the flood plain, STs 22-25, were located in
the same pasture where BHT 2 was excavated.
There was a dense ground cover of tall grass and
reeds, and Shovel Tests 22-25 had in common:
roots and rootlets in the top 20 cm, an increase in
compactness with depth, and scattered gravel and
rocks (<5 cm diameter). None of these shovel tests
on the east floodplain contained any evidence of
buried archaeological deposits.

absence of cortex. The matrix that the flake
was found in was a “sticky” black clay with
scattered, small rocks (<3 cm diameter). Due to
this discovery, ST 11 was placed approximately
5 m to the north.
Shovel Test 11 also produced a proximal
flake fragment. This shovel test was located
approximately 15 m east of the terrace slope and
was also in an area of dense vegetation. The flake
fragment, which was slightly larger than the first
at approximately 3 cm in diameter, was found
between 41-50 cm. This proximal flake fragment
had a defined, lightly prepared platform and a
bulb of percussion, but lacked distinguishable
lateral and distal terminations. The dorsal side
included flake scars and lacked cortex (Figure
6).
Based on the these two positive shovel tests in
such close proximity, CAS excavated an additional
five shovel tests in the immediate vicinity in
order to thoroughly investigate and delineate this
possible site. None of these additional probes,
STs 13, 15-16, and 20-21, contained evidence of
buried archaeological deposits.

Nine shovel tests were excavated on the T1
terrace; five of these were excavated to delineate
two positive shovel tests, STs 10 and 11. All of the
shovel tests on the terrace, containing or devoid
of cultural material, had similar poor surface
visibility, roots/rootlets in the top 20 cm, black
clay, an increase in compactness with depth, and
an increase in gravel/rocks (<15 cm diameter)
with depth.

Recommendations
The background literature and site file
research, as well as the intensive pedestrian survey
and excavations of shovel tests and backhoe
trenches, reveal that no prehistoric or historic
deposits are present in the project area that could
be construed as potentially significant to the city
or state’s history under any criteria of the Texas
Antiquities Code. Accordingly, CAS concludes
that no additional archaeological investigations
are necessary and recommends that the City of
San Marcos be granted regulatory clearance to
proceed with their plans to develop this 37 acre
parcel into a public park.

Shovel Test 10 was the first positive shovel
test; one proximal flake fragment was found
while screening the sediment from 0-20 cm. This
shovel test was approximately 10 m to the east of
the terrace slope in an area with dense vegetation
(tall grass and small trees/shrubs) (Figure 5). The
flake fragment, which was approximately two
centimeters in diameter, had a defined, lightly
prepared platform and a bulb of percussion, but
it lacked a clear distal termination. On the dorsal
side of the flake, there were flake scars and an
