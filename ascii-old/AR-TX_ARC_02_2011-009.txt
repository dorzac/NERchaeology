ABSTRACT
The City of San Saba proposes to construct a sludge disposal area
on a 65-acre tract of land located on the south side of the San Saba
River in San Saba County, Texas. To contain wastewater runoff,
the City proposes to construct a low tailwater berm along the 1300foot eastern boundary of the site. The depth of impact throughout
the disposal area is less than one foot. AR Consultants, Inc.
conducted the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the
disposal area on March 08, 09 and 10, 2011. The primary purpose
of the survey was to define the boundaries of site 41SS28. The site
is a prehistoric lithic scatter, approximately 30 acres of which is
located within the proposed disposal area. To accomplish this, the
area was blanketed with 36 shovel tests excavated along parallel
transects. Despite this coverage, only one interior flake was located
in a shovel test. Additionally, a scatter of 12 lithics were located on
the surface to the north of the site boundary during survey. Two
backhoe trenches were excavated on the eastern side of the site
near the San Saba River. However, only one flake was recovered,
and it was not in primary context. Given the results of this survey,
AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted and that the Texas Historical
Commission concur with this assessment. If buried cultural
deposits are discovered during construction, work in the area
should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission
should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The City of San Saba proposes to construct a sludge disposal area on land immediately
east of the Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is located east of town and on the south
side of the San Saba River in San Saba County, Texas (Figure 1). The City is proposing
to remove sludge from a settling lagoon located west of the Wastewater Treatment Plant
using a floating barge and pipeline, and then to dewater the sludge and ultimately spread
it in a pasture that is located immediately east of the plant. The disposal area’s eastern
boundary follows the curve of the San Saba River, but is approximately 35 meters west of
the riverbank. The disposal area is further bounded by a railroad track berm on the south,
a fence line on the north and a two-track road on the west. The entire disposal area
includes approximately 65 acres. Sludge will be spread over the disposal area and will
ultimately be disked into the pasture soil. To contain water runoff, an 18-inch high
earthen tailwater berm will be constructed along the eastern edge of the disposal area. It
will be constructed using fill sourced from the pasture, and will extend the full 1300-foot
long eastern boundary of the disposal area near the river. The depth of disturbance
resulting from construction of the berm will be less than one foot, which mirrors the
overall depth of impact to the disposal area, which will result from disking.
The City of San Saba contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. to conduct an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of the Wastewater Treatment Plant disposal area.
Because the City of San Saba is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, a Texas
Antiquities Permit was required for this project and permit number 5907 was issued for
it. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 also applies to the
environmental permitting. Other relevant federal legislation includes the Clean Water
Act, as amended (PL92500), the National Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and
the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291).
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines developed by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (n.d.), and adopted by the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission. The following report presents a brief description of the natural
setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the cultural history of Central
Texas. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the investigation
is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes with
recommendations followed by the references cited. Shovel test descriptions are listed in
Appendix A.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is situated within the Llano Uplift natural region of Texas (Diamond,
Riskind and Orzell 1987: Figure 1). As the name implies, the Llano Uplift is a broad
geologic dome of Precambrian rock, primarily granite, which is situated in the eastern
region of the Edwards Plateau (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). While the dramatic
topography of the Edwards Plateau encloses the Llano Uplift to the east, south and west,
the southern reaches of the Rolling Plains border the formation to the north (Diamond, et
al. 1987: Figure 1).
Situated in close proximity to the San Saba River, the underlying geology of the study
area is primarily Quaternary-aged alluvium, which is composed of floodplain deposits
such as gravel, sand, silt, clay and organic matter, and is as deep as 35 feet (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1976). Similarly-aged Fluviatile terrace deposits are present on the
upland edge south of the river floodplain. Specific soils comprising these geological
features are occasionally flooded Frio silty clay loam and the Nuvalde-Shep complex
with 1 to 5 percent slopes (Bynum 1982: Sheet 25). Frio silty clay loam (Fr) is a deep,
nearly level bottomland soil found on the floodplain of the San Saba River. The terrace
deposits adjacent to the floodplain are comprised of the Nuvalde-Shep complex (NxC).
This complex is composed primarily of Nuvalde soils, which are deep, sloping, welldrained loamy upland soils, but also includes approximately 40 percent Shep soils, which
are slightly shallower and steeper upland loams.
San Saba County has a warm climate, featuring hot summers and fairly warm winters
(Bynum 1982: 1). Temperatures range from an average low in February of 34 degrees
Fahrenheit to an average high of 96 degrees in July (Murphey 2011). Rainfall averages
26.19 inches yearly, and the growing season is 227 days.
Küchler defines the Llano Uplift region of Central Texas as the Mesquite-Oak Savannah
vegetative zone (Küchler 1964). This zone is characterized by low to medium tall grasses
with scattered broadleaf deciduous shrubs and trees. Little bluestem and grama are the
dominant grass varieties, while invasive species such as mesquite and cedar have moved
into the native grasslands. Pecans, live oaks and red oaks are commonly found on the
slopes and in the rocky uplands. Blair classifies this area as belonging to the Balconian
biotic zone (1950: Figure 1). This zone contains 57 species of mammals and numerous
reptiles and amphibians.

CULTURE HISTORY
A well-defined cultural chronology for San Saba County has not been developed as few
archaeological investigations have been conducted in this area on the boundary of the
Llano Uplift and the Rolling Plains. The intensive surveys in the region were centered
around the O.H. Ivie Reservoir on the Colorado River (Trierweiler and Kuhl 1993), and
provide specific data for cultural resources in the Colorado River Watershed. As the
study area is situated on the ecotone of the Rolling Plains of Texas, which fall into the
larger Southern Great Plains region of the southwest, a general cultural chronology
developed of the Southern Great Plains is synthesized below. The major prehistoric
cultural stages are the Paleoindian, the Archaic, the Late Prehistoric and the Historic
which are defined by environmental, technological and social changes that had occurred.
The earliest evidence of human occupation in Texas is in the Paleoindian period (11,500
– 5500 BC) yet the cultural material is sparse (Hofman 1989:25). A survey of recorded
Paleoindian points was conducted in the 1990s and in 2005 to identify the number of
distinctive fluted Clovis points in Texas counties. Currently, only one Clovis point has
been found in San Saba, but numerous others have been found in the surrounding
counties (Bever and Meltzer 2007:67-70). The Paleoindian period falls within the
Pleistocene epoch, in which climate and vegetation were markedly different than the later
Holocene, with a cooler and wetter climate than at present (Hughes 1991:8-9; Mallouf
1989:83). There are primarily three site types for this period: big-game kill sites,
habitation areas referred to as campsites, which were used also for lithic production,
butchering or processing station sites, and lithic procurement or quarry sites (Hughes and
Willey 1978; Boyd 1989; Mallouf 1989:81).
The Archaic is typically divided into the Early, Middle and Late periods (Hofman
1989:45). Major climatic shifts occurred, eventually settling into a warmer and drier
environment similar to the modern one, with an increase in grasslands and a reduction of
forests. Site types that occur during this time period are similar to those in the Prehistoric
such as bison kill sites and campsites. During the Early Archaic period (5500 – 3000
BC), hunting for small game became the major form of subsistence which is evidenced
by a shift in lithics styles (Hughes 1991:15). Although bison kill sites date to the Archaic
(Hofman 1989:45), the large, stemless lance points of the Paleoindian period were
replaced with lithics such as stemmed dart points, and grinding implements such as
manos and hearth stones, all of which appear at this time. Evidence for long term
occupation during this period is scarce due to a long drought that may have caused the
uplands to be abandoned for more favorable settings near reliable water sources, and
there are few cultural resources to accurately describe occupation patterns in this time
period (Hofman 1989). There are few sites that are clearly dated to the Middle Archaic
(3000 – 1000 BC) (Boyd 1989:39). The Late Archaic period (1000 BC – AD 200) is
characterized by the use of multiple types of dart points for hunting bison and other game
(Hughes 1991:20). Thousands of sites from the Late Archaic are found in the Southern
Plains indicating a dramatic population increase from the Middle Archaic, with the

prominent site types being open campsites that were near playa basins and along
drainages (Hughes 1991:21).
The Late Prehistoric period (AD 200 – 1700) is recognized as the period of transition
between hunter gather societies of the Archaic to the more settled villages of the Late
Prehistoric (Hughes and Willey 1978:28). In addition, there is an increase in occupation
of the region (Boyd 1989). The climate appears to have been moister with an increase in
reliance on deer and smaller mammals for subsistence (Hofman and Brooks 1989:61).
The introduction of the bow and arrow in the Late Prehistoric coincides with the
appearance of pottery and pit-houses on the Southern Plains (Hughes 1991:24).
Agricultural practices appear during this period, yet probably post date the appearance of
ceramics (Boyd 1989:44-45).
Spanish Explorers were the first Europeans to enter the region in the 16th century, and
were later followed by Euro American settlers in the mid 19th century. Until the late 19th
century, conflict was common between the newly-arrived settlers and the Apache and
Comanche tribes in the area. Following the annexation of Texas, a series of forts were
established, many near the Concho and Colorado Rivers, to stave off the Indian attacks
on settlers in the region (Frazer 1965). Eventually these conflicts ceased and the Native
Americans were resettled into reservations in present day Oklahoma.
San Saba County was organized in 1856 out of Bexar County, and later that year the city
of San Saba was selected as the county seat (Murphy 2011). In the post-Civil War era, the
county experienced a period of substantial growth, spurred primarily by an increase in
agriculture. In 1860 the number of farms in the County was 34. This number jumped to
834 in 1890 and to 1,268 in 1920. Initial primary crops included wheat and oats, but soon
peaches and pecans, the latter of which were naturally abundant, became quite important
agricultural products. Edmund Reisen, an Englishman who immigrated to the County in
1874, made great steps in the planting and production of pecans. He is credited with
laying the groundwork for the extensive pecan industry in the County, which over time
prompted San Saba to proclaim itself the “Pecan Capitol of the World.” The arrival of the
Santa Fe Railroad in 1886 only helped to stimulate the agricultural industry in the
County. Despite droughts and other setbacks, San Saba remains a county that’s economy
is still dominated by agriculture and agribusiness to the present time.
Previous Investigations
As stated earlier in this chapter, relatively few studies have been conducted in San Saba
County. However, several small surveys have been conducted near the City of San Saba,
and many sites have been recorded within a mile of the study area. The most immediately
applicable site is 41SS28, approximately half of which is located within the study area
boundaries, as seen on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) (2011). The site was
first recorded by Daniel Fox in 1982 during a survey conducted for the Texas Department
of Water Resources prior to construction of the City’s wastewater treatment facility (Fox
1982). The site consists of a broad prehistoric occupation era, which Fox attributes to the
Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods. Artifactual deposits at the site consisted of an

extensive, but apparently thin, scatter of chipping debris, occasional mussel shell and
burned rock fragments. Due to the extensive terracing of the area, Fox concluded that the
site was most likely not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP, but suggested that some
degree of subsistence and settlement pattern data could be inferred from the site (1982: i).
The site was revisited by field personnel of Espy, Houston and Associates, Inc. (EHA) in
1988, during a survey of the Lampassas to Goldwaite Transmission Line (Jones,
Sundborg, and Smyth 1988). During the survey, it was noted that, although the site
deposit was thin and heavily disturbed, the site may be more extensive than suggested by
the results of the 1982 survey. This was particularly the case along the eastern boundary
of the site. In the site revisit form, Sundborg and Jones suggested that trenching,
presumably along the eastern boundary, would be beneficial should further disturbance
occur (TASA 2011). A third site revisit was undertaken in 2006 by Charles Hixson of the
Lower Colorado River Authority during transmission line maintenance (Hixson, Kiker,
Prikryl and Malof 2006: 225-227). Hixson located artifacts similar to those described in
the two previous visits, and due to the presence of dart point fragments, suggested that
the site should be more accurately attributed solely to the Late Prehistoric. Hixson further
pointed out that if features are present below the depth of the plow zone, which has yet to
be determined, than the research value of the site would be exceedingly high.
Several sites have been recorded near the current study area, including prehistoric sites
41SS58, 41SS62, 41SS63 and 41SS65, which were recorded during the 1988 EHA
transmission line survey (Jones et al. 1988). All four sites are essentially surface lithic
scatters, and range in type between a lithic procurement site (41SS58), a possible
processing area (41SS62), occupational surface scatter similar to that seen at 41SS28
(41SS63) and an isolated find of a chert biface (41SS65). No further work was
recommended for any of the four sites. An additional prehistoric surface scatter (site
41SS163) was recorded across the railroad tracks directly south of the study area by
Hixson during transmission line maintenance performed by the LCRA in 2006 (Hixson et
al. 2006). The site includes a thin scatter of lithic debitage, and also contains a chert core,
a sandstone mono and burned rock. No further work was recommended.
Though no historic archaeological sites are listed on TASA within a one-mile radius, two
historic resources are present. The first is the Crawford Cemetery (SS-C009), which is
located approximately 800 meters east on the south side of the San Saba River. The
second is a historical marker (Atlas No. 5411000307) which marks the site of the
Barnett-Hamrick Settlement, which dates to between 1855 and 1895, and is located
approximately 900 meters to the southeast along US 190. A review of historic maps of
San Saba County, including the 1916 Soil Map, the 1940 General Highway Map, and the
1961 General Highway Map, confirms that no mapped historic structures are present
within the study area.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Archaeological research in San Saba County has been relatively sparse. However, the
studies conducted and the sites recorded along the San Saba River near the study area
have provided an excellent characterization of the archaeological potential of the river
floodplain, which is relatively high. This is confirmed by the presence of site 41SS28,
approximately 30 acres of which is located within the study area, and the presence of
several sites recorded within a one-mile radius of the study area. 41SS28, like virtually all
sites near the study area, has been described as a broad, yet shallow, surface scatter of
lithic debitage, fire-cracked rock and mussel shell. However, it was suggested by the
original recorder Daniel Fox and by field personnel who subsequently revisited the site
that buried deposits may be present in the eastern edge of the site near the San Saba River
(Fox 1982; Jones et al. 1988; Hixson et al. 2006). Site types that may be present in the
floodplain include buried, likely seasonably-occupied camp sites, which could be
indicated by the presence of occupational debris such as mussel shell lenses, lithic tools
and debitage, and hearths.
Due to its location within a frequently inundated floodplain, the study area has relatively
low potential for containing historic cultural resources. Given the likely extensive
seasonal flooding of the San Saba River, the study area would not have been conducive to
residential placement, and this is confirmed by the absence of mapped structures on any
of the historic maps reviewed prior to fieldwork. Indeed, the only type of historic site that
is remotely likely in this setting would be ephemeral trash scatters along the riverbank.
Methodology
The primary objective of this investigation was to define the horizontal and vertical
boundaries of site 41SS28within the study area, with particular emphasis given to the
goal of ascertaining whether buried features are present. This was to be accomplished by
visual inspection of the ground surface, systematic shovel testing, and trenching in the
easternmost portion of study area where previous investigations suggest that buried site
deposits may be present. The field team walked parallel transects spaced approximately
75 to 100 meters apart within the approximately 65-acre disposal area and made field
notes about artifacts on the surface, ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas.
Shovel tests were excavated at intervals of 75 to 100 meters along each transect. Each
was excavated to an approximate depth of 60cm, so as to search for buried site deposits.
Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. The clay fill from the shovel tests was hand
sorted, while loamy or sandy fill was screened through 1/4” hardware mesh to determine
if cultural materials were present. Trench profiles were described following the
procedures developed by Vogel (2002), and photographs of the profiles were taken. Soil
from trench walls, floors, and backdirt was screened in order to explore for artifacts.
Shovel test and trench matrices were also described on the basis of texture and color. The
Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil colors in each test. Shovel
test and trench locations were recorded using either a Garmin GPS Map 76 or a Garmin
Colorado 400t handheld GPS receiver. Photographs were taken throughout the survey
area using a Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph 8.0 mega pixel digital camera.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections; the first describes the terrain and natural
setting of the study area. The results of the survey and trenching follow, and conclusions
end the chapter. Although shovel tests are described generally within the text, a complete
description can be found in Appendix A.
Study Area
The 65-acre survey area is situated on a broad expanse of semi-improved pasture located
primarily within the floodplain of the San Saba River (Figure 2). The southwestern
approximately 20 acres of the study area is situated on a low terrace above the floodplain,
which is marked by a gentle southwest-trending rise on the landscape (Figure 3). Though
the river generally forms the study area’s eastern boundary, the bank is situated well out
of the study area, approximately 35 meters to the east. A fence line marks the northern
border of the study area tract, while a railroad berm marks the southern border.
Vegetation throughout the study area is relatively uniform, and consists of fairly recently
mowed prairie grasses and weeds. Clustered oaks, hackberries and pecans trace the fence
lines and the river channel margin. Ground visibility was excellent throughout most of
the tract, averaging between 30 and 70 percent, with the slopes and higher-lying areas
offering the best visibility. Several disturbed areas are present in the study area, including
a roughly triangular pit in the southeast portion of the tract, which is utilized as a dump
and encompasses an area of approximately 2.7 acres, and a shallowly-dug depression in
the southwestern portion, which likely holds runoff from the wastewater treatment plant
and encompasses roughly one acre (Figure 4).

The Survey
Survey consisted of parallel transects spaced roughly 70 to 100 meters apart, which were
walked east to west across the study area. Shovel tests were placed along these transects
at intervals of between 75 and 100 meters, based on their relative location to site 41SS28
(Figure 5). Those that were situated outside the site to the north or south had shovel tests
place farther apart, generally 100 meters, while transects that ran through the site had
shovel tests placed at far closer intervals, generally 75 to 80 meters apart.

Figure 5.

Shovel test locations shown on a current aerial photograph of the study
area. The boundaries of 41SS28 are plotted as well. The inset shows the
location of delineating shovel tests around shovel test T4-3.

Shovel testing was first conducted along Transect 1, which paralleled the southern
boundary of the study area, approximately 25 meters to the north. Shovel test T1-1,
which was excavated roughly 100 meters west of the study area’s eastern border
encountered 22cm of dark yellowish brown clayey loam overlaying brown loamy clay
(Appendix A). This same general trend continued along each of the transects, with shovel

tests encountering clay loam to sandy clay loam topsoil, which ranged in hue from dark
yellowish brown to very dark grayish brown, and ranged in depth from 20 to 40cmbs.
Underlying soil was typically loamy clay to sandy loamy clay, which ranged in hue from
brown to dark grayish brown. In the terrace setting located in the southeastern portion of
the study area, which is situated in the Nuvalde-Shep soil complex, a vastly different soil
profile was encountered. This consisted generally of 60cm of dark yellowish brown to
yellowish red loamy clay to sandy clay loam, which contained high amounts of calcium
carbonate and some chert and quartzite gravel. This gravel was common in each shovel
test excavated within the study area and on the ground surface, which is indicative of the
alluvial character of the floodplain setting. This gravel was both rounded and angular.
Some larger cobbles were present as well, particularly in the rising southwestern area.
Shovel tests along Transects 1 and 2 were almost entirely negative, though some amber
bottleneck shards were found in shovel test T2-2. However, three shovel tests excavated
along Transect 3 encountered mussel shell fragments in the top 20 to 40 cmbs. It is
unclear if these indicate cultural activity, as they may have washed in from the river.
Transect 4, which generally ran through the center of site 41SS28, contained the only
shovel test which was positive for cultural material. Shovel test T4-3 contained a single
interior flake, which was recovered in the top 10cm of the fill. Shovel tests T4-3N, T43S, T4-3E and T4-3W were excavated five meters from this positive shovel test in each
of the cardinal directions to search for additional artifacts, although none were recovered.
Additionally, the ground surface was examined around shovel test T4-3, but no additional
artifacts were observed. Shovel tests excavated along Transect 5, which was situated
entirely to the north of the mapped boundaries of site 41SS28, achieved results similar to
those seen along Transect 2, with mussel shells found in the top 40cm of four of the
shovel tests.
Though no further artifacts were located in the shovel tests, a broad scatter of lithics were
observed on the surface near the location of shovel test T5-4. The scatter, which was
densest near the shovel test, trended to the southeast, and likely dissipates to the
northwest of the positive shovel test T4-3 (Figure 6). The scatter consisted mostly of
interior flakes, some of which were sourced from light-colored, fine-grained chert. In
total, 12 artifacts were located on the surface: 1 primary flake which featured a visible
platform, 6 secondary flakes, 4 pieces of shatter and 1 core. This limited scatter
constitutes the only location where artifacts similar to those described in the previous
investigations were encountered in the study area. Its location outside of the mapped
boundaries of the site indicates that the lithics in the scatter were most likely displaced by
plowing that has taken place since the site boundaries were established on TASA.

Trenching
In order to search for buried site deposits in the area where the berm will be installed, two
backhoe trenches were excavated near the plotted eastern boundary of site 41SS28
(Figure 7). The trenches were excavated roughly 50 meters west of the San Saba River,
15 meters from the eastern edge of the study area, and were located approximately 30
meters apart. Trench 1 was oriented parallel to the river channel, while Trench 2 was
oriented perpendicular to the channel. Trenches are described below with complete data
appearing at the end of this section in Table 1.

Trench locations shown on a recent aerial photograph of the study area.

The trenches, excavated as they were in such close proximity to the San Saba River,
contained matrices indicative of the aggrading floodplain environment. Soils encountered
ranged from clay loam to loamy clay, with some sand content encountered in the third
zone of each trench, which is consistent with the continued alluvial deposition of the
floodplain. The presence of occasional water-rolled pebbles in Trench 2 indicates the
likelihood of relatively energetic flood events. Below depths of 60cmbs in Trench 1 and
62cmbs in Trench 2, frequent decayed roots that have become stained with calcium
carbonate filaments speak to the relatively stable nature of the floodplain’s calcareous
soils below these depths. This is further buttressed by the presence of large (5-10mm)
calcium carbonate nodules in the lower zones in each trench. Mussel shells were located
in the back dirt of both trenches, but because no broad shell lenses were present and
because it could not be determined if the shells had been subject to cutting or other
human utilization, it was impossible to classify them as cultural material. One chert
interior flake was found in the back dirt from Trench 2 (Figure 8). Due to its discovery in
the back dirt, it was impossible to ascribe it to a particular depth, and due to the absence

of additional artifacts, it was treated as an isolated occurrence. No artifacts were located
in situ in either trench.

Conclusions
Given the presence of the previously-recorded archaeological site 41SS28 within the
study area boundaries, and the suggestion made by previous investigators that buried
deposits may be present, the study area was thought to have high archaeological
potential. Accordingly, the primary purpose of this study was to systematically define the
vertical and horizontal boundaries of the site, and to search for buried features along its
eastern edge.
In terms of the vertical extent of the site 41SS28 deposit, the results of the survey confirm
that the site may be definitively described as a surface scatter of lithic debris. The almost
total lack of artifacts recovered in shovel tests, with the exception of one flake recovered
in the top 10cm of shovel test T4-3, indicates that the site deposit has virtually no depth.
Furthermore it is likely that any artifacts recovered at depth in the previous site visits
resulted from the extensive plowing of the area. In terms of defining the horizontal extent
of the site, the revisit produced somewhat lackluster results. The only artifacts located on
the ground surface were clustered in a small scatter north of the mapped site boundary.
This new artifact location, as well as the broad extent of artifacts seen in previous site
visits, most likely resulted from extensive plowing. This plowing would have first
scattered artifacts beyond their original location, which was probably atop the rise
overlooking the river, and more recently would have scattered artifacts to their current
location outside the mapped site boundaries. It is likely that the site boundaries should be
remapped on TASA to reflect the newer, less extensive distribution of the lithic scatter.
Despite abundant supposition that they could be present, no buried site deposits were
encountered along the eastern border of the site nearest the river channel, and two
possibilities account for this. First, and most likely, the depth to which the trenches were
excavated, which was a maximum of 220cm, may not have provided adequate depth to
encounter buried site deposits. The depth of the river channel, which was approximately
10 to 12 meters, indicates continued gradation of the adjacent ground surface for quite
some time in the past. As such, sites may be buried far deeper than will be impacted by
construction of the sludge disposal area. Second, buried sites may not be present in this
area of the San Saba River floodplain. Judging by the results of previous investigations
near the study area, the predominant site type for this part of San Saba County are lithic

scatters found in upland settings. As such, it is possible that the floodplain setting would
have been eschewed by prehistoric inhabitants for the less frequently inundated uplands
adjacent to the floodplains.
No historic resources were located during the survey, although this is in keeping with the
low historic potential in the study area. As stated in the Research Design, the location of
the study area largely within a frequently inundated floodplain, the sparsely populated
nature of the study area, and the absence of structures on historic maps suggested that it
was highly unlikely that historic structures would be encountered in the study area. The
only site type thought to be somewhat likely in this setting was ephemeral trash scatters,
and even these were found to be absent.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the results of this archaeological survey, ARC recommends that further
cultural resource investigations are unwarranted in the study area and asks the Texas
Historical Commission to agree with our findings. If buried cultural materials are
discovered during the construction of the pipeline, work should stop in that area
immediately and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be
notified immediately. Work should not continue until the necessary investigations have
been carried out after consultations have been completed.
