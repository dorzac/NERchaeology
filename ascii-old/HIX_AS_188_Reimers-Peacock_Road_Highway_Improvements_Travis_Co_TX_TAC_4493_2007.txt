Abstract

ABSTRACT
On the behalf of Travis County, Hicks & Company conducted an archeological
survey along the proposed alignment of the Reimers-Peacock Road Highway
Improvement project. The project proposes to upgrade the existing ReimersPeacock Road from a partially paved road to a fully paved 3.5 mile road with two
11 foot lanes with five foot shoulders on either side within an 80 foot right-of­
way. The survey was conducted in coordination with the Texas Historical
Commission and in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code under TAC
Permit No. 4493. This linear survey project involved intensive pedestrian
inspection, assessment and photo documentation of the entire project area plus
subsurface shovel testing in areas with soils that had the potential for buried
deposits. The entire project area was inventoried for cultural resources, and no
prehistoric or historic cultural resources were located. Thus no artifacts were
collected and records for the project will be permanently housed at Hicks &
Company.

Introduction and Management Summary

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
In May 2007, Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian
linear survey of the proposed Reimers-Peacock Road Highway Improvement in
southwestern Travis County, Texas. With the exception of a 3000 foot stretch at
the southern terminus of the project where it will straighten the course of the
extant unpaved road (Figure 1), the proposed road follows the current 3.5 mile
road alignment. The proposed road improvement will transform the current
road - which is paved for approximately the first third of the distance and
unpaved dirt track the remainder – into a fully paved highway with two 11-foot
lanes with five foot shoulders on either side within an 80 foot Right-Of-Way
(ROW). The project is being funded through a Travis County Bond Election and
falls under the purview of the Texas Antiquities Code.
Investigations were coordinated with the THC and occurred under Texas
Antiquities Permit (TAC) No. 4493. The survey consisted of an intensive
pedestrian inspection of the entire proposed alignment in accordance with
survey standards established in THCs “Survey Standards for Texas”. Owing to
high surface visibility (>30%) and the presence of substantial areas of exposed
bedrock, only three shovel tests were dug in three locations within the project
area where there appeared to be deposits of sufficient depth. In all other areas of
the alignment periodic shovel probes verified that sediments were either non­
existent or of less then five centimeters in depth. The entire project area was
inventoried for cultural resources, but no prehistoric or historic cultural
resources were identified.
Based on the results of the survey, it is concluded that the proposed project will
have no effect on any prehistoric or historic properties, and no further
archeological investigations are warranted.
The survey was conducted in May of 2007. Bradford Jones functioned as the
Principal Investigator. Bradford Jones and John Campbell, Hicks & Company
staff archeologist, performed the survey.
No logistical difficulties were
encountered during the course of the survey. Report writing occurred during
May of 2007. The remainder of the report includes the following sections:
Definition of Study Area, Archeological Sites and Previous Investigations, Results
of Field Investigations, and Conclusions and Recommendations. This report is
offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit No. 4493.

Definition of Study Area

2.0 DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The Reimers-Peacock Road Highway Improvement project area is located in the
gently-rolling Texas hill country on the southwestern edge of the Jollyville
Plateau. The project corridor roughly follows the current road which is paved for
approximately a third of its length from its northern terminus with highway
US71 and unpaved the remainder of the distance until it intersects on the
southern end with Hamilton Pool Road (Figure 1). The construction of the
current road, subsurface utility lines, fencing and occasional landscape
modifications relating to agricultural land use as well as limited commercial
development near US71 have all modified the project corridor alongside the
current road which otherwise passes through an upland landscape
characterized by motts of live oak and cedar separated by open pastures. While
the area currently consists of primarily undeveloped rangeland, expansion
related to the City of Austin is taking hold in the area with a large housing
development under construction north of the project corridor and along
Hamilton Pool Road.
The project region falls within the northern extent of the Balconian Biotic
Province (Blair 1950) and the Edwards Plateau vegetation region (Gould 1975).
A variety of mammal species are found in this region, the most common of which
includes: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cottontail (Sylvilagus
floridanus) and jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), raccoon (Proycon lotor), armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), coyote (Canis latrans), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Common plant life include: live oak
(Quercus virginiana), texas oak (Quercus texana), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia),
walnut (Juglans microcarpa), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), Texas persimmon
(Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), acacias (Acacia sp.) and prickly
pear (Opuntia sp.). In addition a variety of short and tall grasses grow in the
region. Though vegetation was common within the project area, ground surface
visibility was found to be moderate to excellent throughout the project area with
visibility typically 70-100% (Figure 2).
Geologically the project area is entirely limited to upland contexts with
sediments composed of extremely shallow, rocky upland soils overlying
limestone bedrock. Werchan et al. (1974:15) identify the soils in the project as
Brackett soils, rolling (B1D). Brackett soils, rolling, are generally shallow, well
drained soils that develop over interbedded limestone and marl. The surface is
often exposed bedrock outcrops (20%) and limestone fragments occur on up to
75% of the surface (Figure 3).
The proposed alignment does not cross any waterways. Prehistoric archeological
sites in this region would typically occur on hilltops and along major streams
and their tributaries. Being composed entirely of shallow, upland sediments
and lacking waterways, the project corridor was considered low probability for
containing intact, buried prehistoric cultural elements and moderate overall
probability for containing prehistoric materials of any kind. However, historic
sites were considered to be potentially present at any point along the roadway.
Historic archeological sites that may be present in the project area would most
likely be small farmsteads.

Archeological Sites and Previous Investigations

3.0 ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES AND PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
Background research for the project included a review of previous survey
documentation, a review of the THC’s Sites Atlas database, and related sources.
Results of the study indicate there are no archeological sites previously
documented within the project area.
There are no State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs), National Register listed properties (NRHP), or Texas
Historical Markers (OSHMs) or Registered Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs)
within or in close proximity to the proposed roadway improvements. No known
cemeteries exist within or in close proximity to the project area. In addition,
according to online records at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), no
archeological surveys have been conducted that overlap the project corridor at
any point. Four previously recorded sites, 41TV2067-2070, are located within
1.5 kilometers of the proposed project area with the nearest (41TV2070) nearly a
kilometer to the west of the current alignment (Figure 1). All of the sites were
recorded in 2004 in anticipation of a proposed housing development. The sites
are described as relatively minor surficial lithic scatters with low to moderate
densities of debitage, burned rocks, and occasional tools and tool fragments.
Only Site 41TV2069, citing a slightly more dense artifact assemblage, was
recommended for additional work, while the remaining three were recommended
as ineligible for NRHP-listing.

Results of Field Investigations

4.0 RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists intensively surveyed the 3.5 mile long proposed
alignment for the Reimer-Peacock Highway Improvement project. This survey
included the placement of three shovel tests in areas of possible significant soil
deposits and/or low surface visibility as well as occasional shovel probes to
verify the lack of deposits suggested by the visible ground surface. Shovel tests
were excavated in 10 centimeter arbitrary levels and the material screened
through ¼” hardware mesh. Results were recorded on a standardized shovel test
log.
During the survey the lack of soil deposits was plainly visible in the majority of
the site area (Figure 4). The high surface visibility encountered across the
project area allowed archeologists to document outcropping limestone bedrock
(Figure 5) and obviated the need for shovel testing in accordance with the
minimum standards for shovel testing set out in the THC’s “Archeological Survey
Standards for Texas”.
In the course of the survey, Hicks & Company archeologists also noted evidence
of disturbance throughout the project area. The most obvious disturbance is
the current road surface which is paved over approximately a third of the
distance and unpaved the remainder of its length (Figures 1, 6 & 7). Grading of
the surface appeared likely in many of the areas with small berms present on
one side as well as the installation of drainage features (Figure 8). In addition, a
buried telephone and fiber optic cable line runs parallel to the current road
throughout its length (Figure 9). Other disturbance to the ground surface
within the project area included what may be an old borrow pit (Figure 10) and
the placement of fencing. At the point of intersection of the current road and
US71, development has also impacted the areas immediately adjacent to the
road leading out to the highway (Figure 11).
As previously noted, three shovel tests and occasional shovel probes indicated
that there is little to no intact soil deposits within the project area. In the area of
ST#1 the greatest depth of deposits was located, and these measured a
maximum of 30 centimeters in depth overlaying limestone bedrock.
The
sediment was a light brown clay loam that had been colluvially redeposited as a
result of erosion from an adjacent knoll. It overlay limestone bedrock. The other
two shovel tests indicated deposits of the same soil but with less than ten
centimeters of depth.
No cultural materials or intact archeological contexts were observed on the
surface or in the shovel tests within the project area.

Conclusions and Recommendations

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On the behalf of Travis County, Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an
intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed Reimers-Peacock Highway
Improvement project. The project area follows the proposed alignment for a
distance of 3.5 miles with an 80 foot wide ROW. Excellent surface visibility (70­
100%), three shovel tests and periodic shovel probes did not document any
prehistoric or historic cultural resources. The survey did document modern
disturbance to the area as a result of the construction of the current road, some
agricultural and commercial development and the placement of phone and fiber
optic lines. No artifacts were observed or collected during the course of the
survey and all project records will be permanently housed at Hicks & Company
offices.
Based on the negative results of the survey, no further archeological
investigation is warranted, and Hicks & Company recommends that the project
should proceed relative to the Texas Antiquities Code. This report is offered in
partial fulfillment of TAC permit #4493.
