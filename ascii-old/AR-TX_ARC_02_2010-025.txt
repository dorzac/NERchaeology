ABSTRACT
The City of Garland proposes to relocate an existing marina concession to
an approximately 6.4-acre tract on the shore of Lake Ray Hubbard in
Dallas County, Texas. The project is located north of Interstate 30 near the
intersection of Zion and Chaha Roads in Garland, Texas. The Fort Worth
District of the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Texas Historical
Commission requested that a pedestrian survey be conducted along the
shoreline and to assess the condition of sites 41DL8 and 41DL249. AR
Consultants, Inc. conducted the archaeological survey on May 18, 2010.
During the survey, 14 shovel tests were excavated and three shoreline
bank profiles were recorded. Despite the prehistoric sites recorded in the
study area, no cultural resources were observed during the investigation.
Therefore, AR Consultants, Inc recommends that the project should be
allowed to proceed as planned. However, if cultural deposits are
uncovered during construction, work should cease in that area
immediately and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission and the US Army Corps of Engineers should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Garland is proposing to relocate an existing marina concession to an
approximately 6.4-acre tract on the shore of Lake Ray Hubbard in Dallas County, Texas
(Figure 1). The project is located to the north of IH 30 on the west side of the reservoir,
near the intersection of Chaha and Zion Roads. The Fort Worth District of the US Army
Corps of Engineers (USCOE) and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) has requested
that a pedestrian survey be conducted along the shoreline and to assess the condition of
the archaeological sites 41DL8 and 41DL249. The City of Garland has contracted AR
Consultants, Inc (ARC) to conduct the survey.
The survey was necessitated because the City of Garland is a political subdivision of the
State of Texas. The Antiquities Code of Texas is applicable for this investigation, and
since waters of the United States will be impacted, the Texas Historical Commission will
not only act as the State Review Agency but also will act as the Section 106 review
agency for the US Army Corps of Engineers. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5629 was
issued for the archaeological survey. The purpose of this survey was to locate cultural
resources and to make recommendations about how these resources might be impacted by
construction. Relevant federal legislation includes a Section 404 Permit of the Clean
Water Act, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and
Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No.
11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,” and Procedures for
the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C.
This report has been written in accordance with report guidelines prepared by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural environment and cultural history of the study area. This is followed by the
research design and methodology. The results of the investigation follow and constitute
the body of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the
study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The survey area lies in the Blackland Prairie plant community of North Central Texas
(Diamond, Riskind, Orzell 1987: Figure 1). In this region, sandy soils support oak and
hickory forests while clay soils support tall grass prairie. The area drains quickly, due to
the clay soils promoting runoff, which causes frequent flooding and deposition of
sediment on the floodplain (Mahler 1972:68-69). Kuchler (1964) classified the prairie as
being dominated by Andropogon-Sipa grasses. A review of the 1920 USDA Dallas
County soil map shows that before the reservoir was built the study area was situated in
open prairie south of Rowlett Creek. The study area is approximately 350 feet southwest
of Rowlett Creek and its confluence with Muddy Creek and 1.7 miles west of the East
Fork of the Trinity River.
The study area is underlain by Quaternary Fluviatile terrace deposits that are stratified
according to age (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). The specific soils mapped in the
study area are Altoga silty clay with 5 to 12 percent slopes and Lewisville silty clay with
3 to 5 percent slopes (Coffee, Hill and Ressel 1980:Sheet 21). The Altoga silty clay is a
sloping soil on escarpments of stream terraces and has a topsoil that is typically 4 inches
thick overlaying a subsoil that is yellowish brown (Coffee et al. 1980:11). The Lewisville
silty clay is a deep, well drained stream terrace soil with topsoil that is typically 23 inches
thick overlaying light yellowish brown silty clay to 41 inches (Coffee et al. 1980:27).
Both have high erosion rates. The majority of the study area is in Altoga silty clay, with
only a small section in the western half located in the Lewisville silty clay.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Culture History
Prehistoric occupation within North Central Texas dates before 8500 BP, and is identified
in the archaeological record by distinctive spear points such as Clovis, Dalton and
Plainview. These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain
deposits along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River in North Central Texas (Crook and
Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of PaleoIndian points from the surface of sites in the region (Bever and Meltzer 2007).
The Early Archaic period 8500-6000 BP coincides with the onset of a drying period in
North Central Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period. Isolated Early
Archaic components have been reported in the area. The Middle Archaic period 60003500 BP saw stabilization in the environment that is reflected in current climate
conditions of the oak-savannah and grasslands that are present as the Eastern Cross
Timbers. Middle Archaic sites are typically located on terraces adjacent to the Elm Fork
of the Trinity River rather than on tributary terraces (Prikryl 1990:73).
The population in North Central Texas as shown by site numbers saw a significant
increase during the Late Archaic 3500-1250 BP. A wetter environment contributed to
expansion of the Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands, and sites from this period are
typically found on perennial tributaries with a small density along the Elm Fork. During
the Late Archaic, there was a significant increase in the use of quartzite for the
manufacture of Gary, Ellis, Elam, and Dallas projectile points, which indicates an
increase in the use of local lithic resources (Prikryl 1990:76).
Sedentary life ways increased during the Late Prehistoric I period from 1250-750 BP.
The appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow and houses in the archaeological record
coincided with a drier climate. Site density decreases overall and along tributaries during
this period. The percentage of quartzite tools decreases from the Late Archaic, and
diagnostics from this period include expanded stem arrow points such as Scallorn and
Alba (Prikryl 1990:79-83). By the Late Prehistoric II, 750-250 BP, there is an increase in
buffalo bones in site deposits and a shift in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell,
Fresno, and Washita arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Sites from this
period are typically located on sandy terraces above the flood plains of major tributaries
(Prikryl 1990:80).
Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been
found in North-Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas and is
possibly due to the Native Americans migrating out of the area because they were unable
to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988:103). Yet archival documents and historic
accounts in North Central Texas demonstrate that Native Americans were still present in
the area into the mid-19th century.
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, the aboriginal inhabitants
continued to play a role in the history of the region. Garrett (1972:24) states, “Indian

hostilities almost depopulated North Texas (of Anglo dwellers) after 1839. It dwindled to
less than half.” Hostilities continued until the State of Texas and ten Native American
tribes signed the Treaty of 1843. This treaty provided the impetus for settlement of
several North Central Texas counties.
Dallas County began to see the first Anglo settlers make their way to the prairie lands
during the 1840’s. Anglo settler John Neely Bryan first occupied Dallas County in 1841
on the bluff of the Trinity River. This early settlement attracted other settlers who arrived
to receive land grants or to join established colonies within the area. Many settlers came
through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although only 160 families and single
pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57). Many of the families that
obtained land through these grants maintained and farmed their land well into the midtwentieth century.
The Civil War took its toll on the North Central Texas population, as most of the ablebodied men left to fight for the Confederacy. Still, Dallas County continued to grow and
prosper after the war. The primary industry throughout Dallas County was agricultural
until the twentieth century. This was replaced by manufacturing soon after the Great
Depression. Defense factories built near Grand Prairie for the development of goods for
World War II attracted those seeking work from rural areas. From the 1940s onward,
Dallas and Tarrant Counties’ many factories continued to turn out a wide variety of
products, including airplanes, helicopters, mobile homes, electronics, and plastics. Along
with the increase of manufacturing was a rapid rise in the population of Dallas, Fort
Worth, and the surrounding communities. Between 1950 and 1990, Dallas County has
tripled in population to almost two million residents (Handbook of Texas Online 2010).
Previous Investigations
A review of the Texas Archeological Site Atlas (TASA 2010) shows that numerous
studies have been conducted in the immediate vicinity of the study area. The largest
being that conducted for Forney Reservoir, now Lake Ray Hubbard, by members of the
Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) in the early 1960s (Harris and Suhm 1963). This
present study falls within the boundaries of the DAS survey. During the survey, five sites
were recorded within a kilometer of the study area. These sites (DL1, 4, 5, 6 and 8) were
prehistoric sites that they associated with the Wylie Focus, however none contained rings
or pits. These sites ranged from buried midden deposits to lithic scatters. None of the
sites contained diagnostic material and were already heavily eroded at the time of the
survey. It is likely that they are all temporary campsites that date to the Archaic. DL1, 4
and 5 are located on a terrace above Rowlett Creek, and are currently covered by water.
DL 6 and 8 are on the north side of Faulkner Point Peninsula and consisted of lithic
scatters. No further work was recommended for these sites. As the result of a 1984 study
in which DL 8 could not be located, Nunley stated that the site was likely underwater.
A study conducted in 1985 by ARC recorded DL249, which consisted of a small lithic
scatter, and also revisited DL6 and confirmed that the site was completely gone (Skinner
1985). A study was also conducted of Highway 67 (now IH 30) in 1987, but no sites were
recorded near this study area (TASA 2010). DL249 and possibly DL8 could be within the
study area boundaries, and a site revisit will be attempted for both during this survey.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The study area is located in the uplands above the inundated channel of Rowlett Creek.
Despite the damage to the shoreline caused by erosion and the construction of the
reservoir in addition to historic farming practices in the area, the area had potential for
prehistoric and historic cultural resources.
Previous investigations have shown that prehistoric sites are concentrated along Rowlett
Creek. Two sites are reported to be within the boundaries of the study area as well as
others that have been recorded just outside the study area. These sites are located along
the creek on terraces. Though Nunley claimed that 41DL8 was inundated during or after
reservoir construction, it is mapped by TASA on the shore. As such, field personnel
attempted to relocate both DL8 and DL249 and assess their NRHP eligibility. The 1920
USDA Soil Map of Dallas County shows the study area was approximately 350 feet
southwest of Rowlett Creek, which has been inundated by the reservoir. Given the short
distance to permanent water, possible sites are likely to be temporary camps and would
consist of artifact scatters, as is the case for sites from the surrounding area.
According to the 1900 Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County and the 1920 USDA Soil Map
of Dallas County the area was occupied historically, and was likely continually farmed
for over a century until the reservoir was constructed. The 1920 USDA map shows two
structures near the study area. However, no historic sites or artifacts were identified
during the original study (Skinner 1985). With the recent developments on the peninsula,
these sites would likely be limited to isolated artifacts or buried trash middens, and this
possibility was considered very low.
Methodology
The field team walked parallel transects spaced 10 meters apart and made thorough field
notes about the ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas where soil was exposed.
Throughout the course of the pedestrian survey, close attention was paid to the eroded
shoreline, which was visually inspected for artifacts that may have been exposed by
erosion. Shovel tests were excavated according to THC guidelines (n.d.) to the bottom of
Holocene deposits and averaged 30 cm in diameter. The silty clay from the shovel tests
was inspected visually and broken into smaller pieces in order to determine if cultural
materials were present. Additionally, locations along the shoreline bank were profiled to
supplement the shovel test information. Shovel test and bank profile matrices were
described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to
identify the specific soil colors in each shovel test and profile. Soil profiles were
described following the procedures developed by Vogel (2002) and photographs were
taken using a Fuji FinePix J38 12.2 mega pixel digital camera. The shovel test and bank
profile locations were recorded with a handheld Garmin Colorado receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections with the description of the study area
followed by the survey results. Shovel tests and bank profiles will be described briefly
within the text and are detailed in Tables 1 and 2. Conclusions end the chapter.
Survey Area
The study area consists of a 6.4-acre tract located on the northern shore of the Faulkner
Point Peninsula. The small, bulbous peninsula juts east into Lake Ray Hubbard from the
reservoir’s western shore. The study area sits immediately north of the access road to IH
30, and east of the terminus of Zion Road. The area is crossed by dirt roads that skirt the
shoreline and lead eventually to a complex of condominiums on Zion Road. Generally,
the study area encompasses the sloping shore north of the 450’ contour line as shown on
the Mesquite, Texas 7.5’ USGS map. Topography in the area was undulating, and
featured relatively consistent slopes from the level upland south of the study area toward
the shoreline (Figure 2). Elevations ranged from a high point of 460’ near the IH 30
access road to a low point of 435’ at the shoreline. Vegetation in the study area consisted
of numerous pecan trees, a few isolated bois d’arcs, and thick ground cover that include
waist-high prairie grasses, weeds, vines, green briar, and occasional blackberries. The
pecans were clustered in a small grove in the center of the study area, but were also
scattered throughout. The thick vegetation contributed to very poor ground visibility that
rarely improved from 0 percent. The shoreline was heavily eroded, with jagged banks
that ranged from 50cm to three meters above the water line. The study area’s silty clay
dominated soil profile was very evident in the bank’s stratigraphy.

Survey Results
A pedestrian survey of the study area revealed no evidence of cultural materials, due
mainly to the poor ground visibility. However, the reservoir’s eroding banks provided an
excellent stratigraphic profile. As such, in addition to walking and visually inspecting the
study area’s surface, the banks were visually inspected. No cultural materials were
observed however, either on the ground surface or eroding out of the shoreline bank.
Fourteen shovel tests were excavated in the study area, and were placed in a general
zigzag pattern alternating between the shoreline and level areas upslope near the study
area’s southern boundary (Figure 3). Shovel test LP1 revealed a soil profile that consisted
of dark grayish brown silty clay topsoil overlaying light yellowish brown silty clay
subsoil, which is generally in keeping with the Altoga and Lewisville silty clay soils
identified prior to fieldwork. This general soil profile was encountered in each successive
shovel test, though the topsoil alternated between dark grayish brown and brown (Table
1). The soil profile revealed in the shovel tests was reflected in the bank profiles.
The only exception to the above mentioned soil profile was encountered in shovel test
LP4, which encountered 10cm of mottled clay fill overlaying a 25cm lens of black clay.
These soils overlay the omnipresent light yellowish brown clay subsoil at a depth of
35cm. The fill layer may result from the demolition of a structure upslope from the study
area, which is a supposition buttressed by the presence of various building materials in
the shovel test. These include nine fragments of modern white ceramic tile and a fistsized piece of fine aggregate concrete. Additional ceramic tile fragments were observed
elsewhere on the surface in this area. Modern glass was encountered as well in LP4, and
was also encountered in shovel tests LP6 and LP8. These glass fragments were amber
and green in color and all came from modern beer bottles, which was evident all along
the shore. Additionally, a curled piece of heavily corroded wire was found in LP8. None
of the materials found in these shovel tests were historic in age.
Bank profiles along the shoreline were consistent with the shovel tests throughout the
study area. The distinctive silty clay topsoil was uniform along the majority of the
shoreline and ranged in thickness between 30 and 65 cm and the boundary was typically
clear and wavy with a few areas containing a diffuse boundary due to slumping (Table 2).
The subsoil was exposed between 30 and 65 cm along the shoreline to depths up to three
meters. Bank profile 3, taken near shovel test LP4, revealed a soil profile similar to that
shovel test, with a layer of fill and a lens of black clay visible in the profile (Figure 4).
Locations of bank profiles are shown on Figure 3. No cultural materials were seen any of
the exposed banks.
In an attempt to relocate sites 41DL8 and 41DL249, special attention was paid to the
sites’ recorded UTM on file with TARL. In addition to thorough visual inspection of the
surface area, shovel tests LP1, LP2, LP3, LP4 and LP5 were placed between the site
locations. However, both surface inspection and shovel testing failed to locate any
prehistoric cultural materials. In the case of 41DL8 this is likely due to the fact that the
site location is plotted approximately 100 feet west of the study area, though Nunley
asserts that it is underwater (1984). 41DL249 however, was found to be plotted within the

heavily eroded spillway of a concrete culvert (Figure 5). Though the cutbanks of the
spillway were carefully inspected, no lithics were observed. The culvert was most likely
built since the site was recorded, and as such, it appears that 41DL249 may have been
destroyed. Both sites were recorded as surface sites and have likely eroded away or were
simply not visible due to the thick ground cover in the study area.

View is to the south.

During survey, field personnel located an east to west-running stone wall that is located
just inside of the study area’s southern border (Figure 6). The wall is made of cut
limestone blocks held together with fine aggregate concrete, and measures 18” wide, 24”
tall on the north (down slope)-facing side and 12” tall on the south (up slope)-facing side.
The wall runs for several hundred feet, and seems to follow the 445’ or 450’ contour line.
Though the wall was initially believed to be historic, City of Garland employees attested
that the wall was constructed in the 1980s as part of a failed condominium development
in the level upland south of the study area. As such, it was not recorded as an
archaeological site.

Conclusions
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if the study area contained significant
historic or prehistoric cultural resources. No evidence of prehistoric or historic
occupation was found anywhere on the surface or buried in the sediments along the
shore. The absence of prehistoric resources is likely due to a lack of prehistoric
settlement in this particular 6.4-acre tract. In addition to the absence of surface artifacts,
plowing, weeding and erosion would likely have deflated and exposed any prehistoric
artifacts had they been present in the study area, which is clearly not the case.
Additionally, development in the area may have displaced some of the ephemeral artifact
scatters such as 41DL249, which consisted only of two flakes observed on the surface,
and has been destroyed by runoff from a culvert spillway. Potential for historic sites was
also low in the study area, due to the use of the region as farmland. The same patterns of
plowing, weeding and erosion that would have deflated and exposed prehistoric artifacts
holds true for historic material as well, which was likewise not found to be present in the
study area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the negative results of the survey and absence of cultural materials within the
study area, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource investigations
are unwarranted. The City of Garland should be allowed to relocate its marina concession
to the surveyed area. We further recommend that if cultural resources are uncovered
during construction that work should cease in that area and the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission and the US Army Corps of Engineers should be
notified.
