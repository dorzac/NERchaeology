ABSTRACT
North Texas Municipal Water District is proposing to build the Lower Bois d’Arc
Creek Reservoir, northeast of Bonham in Fannin County, Texas. In 2011 and 2013,
AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of 30 percent of the
proposed reservoir footprint (Davis et al. 2014). During the 2013 survey, one of the
proposed high potential archaeological survey areas, (Q), crossed private property
owned by Harold “Thump” Witcher. At the time, Mr. Witcher denied a request for
survey access and survey areas Q1 and Q2 replaced area Q. Since that time, Mr.
Witcher identified the presence of archaeological sites on his property and they were
recorded as 41FN176, 41FN177, 41FN178, and 41FN179. The U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers provided this information to North Texas Municipal Water District, who in
turn directed AR Consultants, Inc. to conduct an intensive pedestrian survey of
Witcher’s property, since he was willing to grant access. The survey of the 156 acres
was conducted between October and November of 2015 under Texas Antiquities
Permit 7423. The locations of three previously recorded sites and three new sites
(41FN244, 41FN245, and 41FN246) were documented during the systematic survey.
Previously recorded site 41FN179 was not located and is not present in its previously
reported locations. Therefore, the site could not be evaluated. No additional testing is
recommended at sites 41FN245, and 41FN246. These sites have low artifact density
in the plow zone with no evidence of organic preservation, intact features, or deeply
buried undisturbed deposits. These sites are considered not eligible under Criterion A,
B, C, or D of the NRHP or as SALs. Testing and research of the prehistoric
components at sites 41FN176, 41FN177, 41FN178, and 41FN244 is warranted in
order to determine their full vertical and horizontal extents as well as to assist in
making NRHP determinations. Additional intensive shovel testing is necessary on the
North Texas Municipal Water District property south of the Witcher property, to try
and relocate site 41FN179. The survey demonstrated that prehistoric sites were
present on the terrace edge, while the late 19th to mid-20th century historic sites were
set further away from the edge. The artifacts recovered from the survey indicate Late
Archaic through Middle Caddo Native American occupations. All project records will
be curated at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, while the artifacts will
be returned to Mr. Witcher.

INTRODUCTION
North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) is proposing to build the Lower Bois d’Arc
Creek Reservoir (LBCR), northeast of Bonham in Fannin County, Texas (Figure 1). The
proposed reservoir stretches from U.S. Highway 82 (US 82) on the east side of Bonham, Texas,
northeast within the Bois d’Arc Creek valley to the dam site, approximately 1,300 feet (ft) south
of Coffee Mill Lake. The reservoir will inundate 16,526 acres at the top of the conservation pool
and will cover significant areas of alluvial terraces that are along the north and west sides of the
Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain. The project will require that the Tulsa District of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) issue a 404-permit to NTMWD. In addition, an antiquities permit
was secured from the Texas Historical Commission (THC) before fieldwork was conducted since
portions of the proposed survey area were on property owned by NTMWD.
Early in the LBCR project planning, a research design (Skinner et al. 2010) was developed under
the guidance of a Programmatic Agreement (PA) for the project that was drafted and signed by
NTMWD, the Tulsa District of the USACE, the THC, and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. In
anticipation of beginning archaeological survey in the reservoir area, AR Consultants, Inc.
(ARC) conducted research, developed maps, and a discussion with regard to predicting areas
which were considered to have high and low potential for containing historic and prehistoric
archaeological sites. In 2011 and 2013, ARC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of 30
percent of the proposed LBCR footprint (Davis et al. 2014).
During the 2013 survey, proposed Survey Area Q included private property owned by Harold
“Thump” Witcher, Jr. (Figure 2). At the time, Mr. Witcher denied NTMWD’s request for survey
access causing ARC to revise the proposed survey area to the two parts (Q1 and Q2) presented in
the final report (Davis et al 2014:99). Since that time, Mr. Witcher identified archaeological sites
on his property. In the summer of 2015, he allowed archaeologists to document sites 41FN176,
41FN177, 41FN178, and 41FN179 (Perttula et al. 2015a). NTMWD was provided this
information by the USACE, and ARC was directed to conduct an intensive pedestrian survey of
the original portion of Survey Area Q owned by Mr. Witcher.
Given that the Texas Antiquities Permit ([TAP] 5950) for the survey phase of LBCR had been
closed and the report finalized, ARC obtained a new permit (TAP 7423) to survey this area,
which included property owned by NTMWD (Figure 3). Since the majority of the present survey
was conducted on private property, a copy of the final report and all artifacts collected on private
property will be returned to Mr. Witcher. The area identified on Figure 3 consists of
approximately 156 acres. ARC had originally planned to survey this area given its elevations and
topographic relief being considered high potential for prehistoric sites. This study area and his
property represent the bulk of the remaining terrace deposits along Bois d’Arc Creek that had not
been surveyed by ARC in the LBCR study area.
Because reservoir construction will affect Waters of the U.S., the project will require a 404permit from the USACE. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90190), and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291).
The Texas Antiquities Code (Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) also applies
to the cultural resource investigations for the overall LBCR project since NTMWD is an entity of

the State of Texas. The purpose of the survey was to gather information needed to make
recommendations about known and previously unknown archaeological sites and their eligibility
for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL).
The survey was conducted between October and November of 2015. A total of six
archaeological sites (3 prehistoric, 2 historic, and 1 multicomponent) were documented. The four
previously reported site locations were revisited, and three were newly recorded. Previously
recorded site 41FN179 was not relocated or documented. During the survey, a total of 454
shovel tests (STs) were excavated in the 156-acre study area. Of those, 49 STs contained
artifacts, approximately 11 percent. The following report contains a description of the natural
environment followed by a detailed summary of previous archaeological investigations
conducted within the property from published and unpublished sources. A comprehensive
historical background and previous investigations of the reservoir area compiled from the
archival research, oral history information, and local resources precedes the in individual
archaeological site discussions, followed by conclusions and recommendations that arise from
the study. A list of references cited and appendices conclude the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The topography of the study area has been sculpted by the down-cutting of the Red River and its
tributaries, which include Bois d’Arc Creek. Bedrock is exposed outside these two major
drainage valleys, but is generally covered in the valleys by recent Quaternary alluvium. Older
Quaternary terrace deposits occur in the Red River valley upstream and downstream from the
mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek (Jacobs 1981). The Bureau of Economic Geology ([BEG 1966,
1967) has mapped only a small number of these deposits in the reservoir area. A sheet of
Quaternary sands overlies the elevated Eagle Ford formation, which constitutes an upland ridge
between Bois d’Arc Creek and the Red River (Figure 4). The ridge has a maximum elevation of
595’ above mean sea level (amsl), but presents a gradual rise from both the river and the creek
floodplains. Bonham Marl overlies the Eagle Ford formation west of Coffee Mill Creek on the
north side of Bois d’Arc Creek. Bonham Marl, covered by a thin layer of sandy loam, is also
exposed in the uplands east of the proposed dam location, and creates the appearance of a
geologic terrace on the northeast side of the creek. Brownstown Marl and Gober Chalk back the
Blossom Sand formation, along the southern edge of the reservoir. Erosion of these formations,
particularly the Blossom Sand, created a steep slope, rising to 600’ amsl, contrasting with the
more gradual rise on the north side of Bois d’Arc Creek. The valley is filled with small areas of
first and second Quaternary terraces, and elsewhere clay alluvium rests on the decomposing
Bonham Marl and Eagle Ford formations.

More specifically, the LBCR Witcher Property study area is comprised of terrace deposits and
alluvium (BEG 1967). The survey area includes three soil types: Derly silt loam, Porum loam,
and Tinn clay. Bois d’Arc Creek’s floodplain is primarily composed of Tinn clay, with a slope of
up to one percent and is inundated an on average of more than once a year (Goerdel 2001:71).
The typical soil profile has a 10-inch thick black clay surface layer and a 40-inch thick very dark
gray clay that overlies the subsoil. The subsoil is typically 30-inch thick and is dark gray clay
with dark grayish brown mottles. In a climax condition, the floodplain would have been covered
with a mixture of hardwood forest and grass understory. Today much of the floodplain is farmed
or used as pasture. The Porum loam and Derly silt loam have a high available water capacity and
a very slow permeability, thus allowing seeps and springs to occur. These can flow regularly
from the soil, or the junction of the soil and the underlying Bonham Marl. Both loams have
similar profiles with A and E horizons over a variety of B-horizons. The A and E horizons are
typically thin covering the top 12 to 14 inches above the lower horizons. Much of these areas are
now farmed or grazed.
The Red River is the major perennial drainage in the vicinity of the study area. Bois d’Arc,
Timber, Honey Grove, and Coffee Mill creeks are also mapped as perennial streams on early 20th
century maps of Fannin County. The three latter tributaries are more than six to nine miles in
length while Bois d’Arc Creek is more than 58 mi long. The intermittent tributaries that flow into
Bois d’Arc Creek from the north are two to four miles long, while tributaries on the south side of
the creek are generally more than seven miles long. All the tributaries rapidly carry rainfall off
the upland prairie. Numerous springs have been documented in Fannin County (Brune 1981:179181); most originated from Upper Cretaceous sand and silt, and river terrace gravel and sand. On
the ridge north of Bois d’Arc Creek, springs, such as Bryant Springs, occur at the junction of the
overlying fourth terrace sands and the Eagle Ford formation. On the south side of the creek,
water comes out of the Ozan silt, which is above the Gober Chalk, Roxton Limestone, and the
Brownstown Formation. Additionally, some springs originate in Quaternary terrace sands at the
edge of the creek floodplain.
In a broad sense, four major climax vegetation communities can be found adjacent to the
reservoir study area. As defined by Küchler (1964), the Southern Floodplain Forest fills the Red
River floodplain and extends slightly up the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain. A small portion of the
Oak-Hickory Forest covers the Red River terraces on both sides of the river upstream and
downstream from the mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek. The Blackland Prairie is south of Bois d’Arc
Creek and overlies the Gober Chalk and Roxton Limestone that extend to the south. A separate
upland prairie is on the ridge, north of the creek; it is mapped as Cross Timbers by Küchler.
Different vegetation area limits are presented by Diamond et al. (1987:Figure 1) and by Diggs et
al. (2006:Figure 2). An unmapped hardwood forest fills the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain, as well
as the tributaries; it is present on the valley terraces north of the creek. The forested areas would
have produced nuts that were available to humans, including acorns that were also foraged by
forest-dwelling mammals. It appears from the research of Jurney (1994), Flores (1984, 1985),
and Schambach (1995) that bois d’arc trees (Burton 1973) were historically abundant in the
creek valley; this may have been the case for hundreds or thousands of years (Smith and Perino
1981; Winberry 1979).

These forested areas were inhabited by deer, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, squirrels, skunks,
beavers, minks, muskrats and others; rabbits, antelope, and bison lived in the upland prairies
(Blair 1950). The river and creeks were home to fish, turtles, frogs, snakes, mussels, and
crayfish. Ducks made their homes in the sloughs and flowing channels, while an abundance of
other bird species inhabited the forests permanently or during yearly migrations. The Fannin
County climate is warm and humid with hot summers and moderate winter temperatures.
Rainfall averages 43.99 in. annually with monthly precipitation ranging from 2.02 in. January to
6.06 in. May. High rainfall occurs in the spring and fall.
Six microenvironments are used to predict and interpret prehistoric and historic land use
(Skinner et al. 2010:8). These are presented from south to north on the schematic illustration
below (Figure 5). The rolling upland prairie (Zone 1) in the south is where herbivores grazed on
the prairie grasses and rainwater drained rapidly down to the LBC floodplain by way of short
steep intermittent tributaries. The Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain comprises Zone 2; it includes
very few isolated knolls. Water was available for at least part of each year and the area flooded at
least once a year. The widest variety of plants and animals would have lived in this zone,
including Bois d’Arc trees (Maclura pomifera) and giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea). Zone 3
contains short, flowing tributaries, and the valley slopes on the north side of the creek. This zone,
is similar to Zone 2, but contains elevated terraces farther from water, which means less
flooding. Zone 4 is the level upland prairie composed of fourth terrace Quaternary sediments,
deposited by the Red River. Zone 5 is comprised of the younger terrace sediments deposited by
the Red River in ancient times. Zone 6 is the Red River and its active floodplain; giant cane was
abundant prehistorically. Zones 2 and 3 were forest-covered with a grass understory prior to
historic clearing for farm and pasture land. The LBCR Witcher Property study area falls within
Zone 3.

microenvironments from south of Bois d’Arc Creek (left) to the north side of the
Red River floodplain (right) (Skinner et al. 2010:8).

Data from the Blackland Prairie and Post Oak Savanna have been useful in modeling the
environmental change in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene (Fields and Tomka 1993:78-79).
They argue that pollen data from Weakly Bog in Leon County and Boriack Bog in Lee County is
best used in reconstructing environmental conditions for the western edge of Northeast Texas

which coincides with Fannin County (Collins and Bousman 2015). The bogs have high arboreal
pollen and low grass pollen prior to about 6500 B.C and the reverse between 6500 B.C. and 500
B.C. After 500 B.C. there is moderate arboreal pollen and low grass pollen. Using information
from Collins and Bousman (2015:78), it is argued that during the middle Holocene about 3000
B.C. grasslands may have extended east into the western edge of northeastern Texas but that by
500 B.C. oak woodlands were re-established and continue to the present. A 14,000-year stable
isotopic record from the Aubrey site has documented similar changing climatic conditions in the
Prairie-Savanna setting (Humphrey and Ferring 1994:Figure 8) in the upper Elm Fork River
valley north of Denton. From ca. 11,000 to 7500 years ago, there was evidence of more rainfall,
more humidity, and cooler temperatures than the present day climate. This pattern of additional
moisture was repeated between 2,000 and A.D. 1, and again after approximately A.D. 1000.
Conversely, the climate was dryer between 5500 to 2000 B.C. and again between A.D. 1 and
A.D. 1000. These climatic cycles have implications for the location of the prairie-savanna
border, the presence or absence of faunal resources, particularly bison, and the natural resource
potential of the Fannin County area. Dendrochronological analyses (Stahle and Cleaveland 1994)
provide more detailed information about climate of the past 1000 years. The tree rings document
numerous wet and dry periods with major droughts in the late A.D. 1200s, the mid-1400s, the
1600s, and the mid-1700s. These varying conditions would have impacted springs and overall
drainage flow as well as the presence and abundance of native plants and animals. Furthermore,
the ability to cultivate and harvest edible plant foods would also have been affected by the
climatic changes. While there is not a consensus among these authors with regard to the dating of
changes, there is general agreement that grasses with an associated dry climate were present
between 5000-6000 B.C. and 500 B.C./A.D. 1.

Prehistoric Occupation
The earliest Native American occupation seems to have occurred in Fannin County was during
the early Paleoindian period when fluted Clovis dart points were being made. Dozens and maybe
hundreds of Clovis points have been collected from the North Sulphur River channel in the
southern part of the county but only one has been documented (Bever and Meltzer 2007:Table 1;
Carley 1986; Todd and Skinner 2007; Jennings 2008; Davis et al. 2014). Virtually all these
Clovis points were made from exotic cherts that occur elsewhere in Texas and Oklahoma. None
of these finds came from well-dated geologic contexts. The only geological profile in the county
that extends to pre-Clovis time is from the bank of the North Sulphur River at Ralph Hall
Reservoir (Skinner et al. 2005; Bousman and Skinner 2007). This profile was collected on a 9.5
m deep river bank where 17 distinct zones were described, and three radiocarbon dates collected
(Skinner et al. 2005:29; Bousman and Skinner 2007:42). The first sample came from near the
bottom of Unit 3 and was dated to 10,860±140 B.P. (7.1 m below the surface). The second
sample was from the top of Unit 4 (7.2 m below the surface) and was dated to 15,510±330 B.P.,
while a sample from the bottom of the unit dated 17,470±330 B.P (9.25 m below the surface).
Additionally, a cobble core found on the face of the adjacent riverbank could possibly date to the
time of Clovis or earlier (Skinner et al. 2005:29; Bousman and Skinner 2007:42). Excavations at
the North Central Texas Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479) demonstrated that Clovis people were
hunting a wide array of large and small mammals as well as utilizing raw material for lithics
from sources more than 200 kilometers away (Ferring 2001). In addition to early point types,
such as Clovis and Folsom, later styles including San Patrice, Dalton, and Plainview have been
found in the area (Story 1990:177-211; Johnson 1989; Jennings 2008). It is apparent that the
surrounding area was visited or occupied during the Paleoindian period, but evidence of
undisturbed campsites has not been found. The low-density sites and the abundance of exotic

chert artifacts found in the drainage channels of the North Sulphur River indicate that
Paleoindian people were nomadic hunters and gatherers (Mahoney 2001:8) who came to Fannin
County on a periodic basis for the purpose of acquiring specific resources or spending the winter
in an environment that was protected from the harsh winters on the high plains (Skinner et al.
2005:62-63). They may have come as “ridge runners” (Hofman 1988; Thurmond and Wyckoff
1999:245-246) but evidence of such a mode of transportation has not been thoroughly
documented in Northeastern Texas. The transition from the Paleoindian period to the Archaic has
recently been discussed as a series of economic, settlement, technological, and social changes
that can be termed the “ProtoArchaic” (Bousman and Oksanen 2012:224).”
During the Archaic, which is divided into Early, Middle, and Late periods, groups continued to
live as mobile hunting and gathering bands (Perttula 2016a). Sites dating to this period were
briefly and seasonally occupied; they are represented by lithic scatters, some of which were
found at repeatedly revisited locations. Burned rock features occur at Middle Archaic sites where
plant cooking was more evident. In the southern part of Fannin County, Middle Archaic people
harvested mussels from the North Sulphur River channel (Skinner et al. 2005:47-48). Mussel
shells were also found at several prehistoric sites along upper Bois d’Arc Creek (Hsu 1968:1017) as well as in the LBCR study area (Davis et al. 2014:211). In the Late Archaic, increased
population density limited group mobility, causing groups to settle into restricted territories and
to focus on the use of locally available lithic sources for chipped stone tools (Perttula 1998:17–
18).
During the Woodland period, a sedentary lifestyle is indicated by the presence of circular and
rectangular houses; undecorated thick-walled-grog tempered Williams Plain pottery, and
increased amounts of native plant foods. Fourche Maline ceramics traditions, like Williams
Plain, are known for their plain and minimally decorated vessels (Ellis 2013:139). The vessels
are typically thick-walled, flower-pot shaped jars and bowls with flat disc-shaped bases
(Schambach 1998:81-82, Schambach 2002:91-93, Dockall et al. 2008:22, Ellis 2013:139). These
ceramics are typically tempered with a variety of materials including clay/grog, bone, grit, and/or
sand (Schambach 1998:81-82, Ellis 2013:139) Schambach (1998:25) concluded in his report on
the Cooper site in Arkansas, that 9 millimeters (mm) was the mode thickness for Williams Plain
ceramics. He went on to state that the mode thickness was 7 to 8 mm in the larger collection
from the Means site (Schambach 1998:82). Ellis (2013:139) states that the thickness is highly
variable, but average 12 mm.
While Gary dart points were used concurrently with arrow points during the Woodland period,
arrow points would eventually replace the dart point (Perttula 2004:376). During excavations at
the Gene and Ruth Ann Stallings site (41LR297), north of Paris in Lamar County, numerous
postholes were uncovered, which possibly represent a rectangular house 80 ft long and more than
20 ft wide (Skinner 2007, 2016). A house with a similar pattern and size was uncovered at the
Poole site (3GA3) in southwestern Arkansas (Wood 1981). If the postholes at 41LR297 represent
a rectangular house, the Stallings site and the Poole site would be the only known examples of
rectangular Fourche Maline houses. Coles Creek pottery and associated chipped stone artifacts
appeared after A.D. 600. Prehistoric Native Americans at this time settled into small hamlets and
camps, dispersed within recognizable territories (Perttula et al. 1993:99). These technological

changes coincided with a gradual population increase. The Ray site (41LR135) in east central
Lamar County contains a deposit that spans this period (Bruseth et al. 2001).
Formative Caddo people are first recognized about A.D. 800 and this time period lasted until
approximately A.D. 1000. Horticulture was developing, but hunting and gathering continued to
provide the main foods (Mahoney 2001:10). Settlements consisted of villages, hamlets, and
single-family dwellings. Some of the villages contained associated platform and/or burial
mounds (Perttula 2004:383). In the Early Caddo period, hunting and gathering subsistence
strategies were supplemented by the cultivation of maize, squash, and several kinds of native
seeds (Perttula 2004:383; Mahoney 2001:10). The material culture was as diverse as during later
Caddo times, which includes various types of ceramics, lithic tools and arrow points, as well as
axes, celts, pipes, and various ground stone tools. The Early Caddo period marks a transition
from undecorated plain wares that dominate Woodland Period assemblages to a more diversified
collection of ceramics, particularly the introduction and florescence of a relatively wide variety
of decorative elements potentially associated with different Caddo groups, including the first
examples of engraved and polished vessels (Emerson and Girard 2004:57; Perttula 2013:186).
Coles Creek Incised ceramics, which generally occur in high frequencies at Caddo sites in
Northwest Louisiana and parts of Arkansas (Kidder 1990), are relatively marginal in Early
Caddo assemblages in East Texas (Perttula 2011:70-71). Decorative types from East Texas
Caddo sites include fine wares Hickory, Holly, and Spiro Engraved, utility wares Coles Creek,
Davis, Kiam, East, Crockett Curvilinear, and Dunkin Incised, Weches Fingernail Impressed,
Hollyknowe Ridge Pinched, and Crenshaw Fluted (Perttula 2013:186). Incising is characteristic
of utility ware decoration while burnishing and post-fire engraving are the decorative techniques
associated with fine wares (Perttula 2011:51). Despite the incorporation of decorative techniques
in ceramic production during the period, the majority of Early Caddo assemblages are still
composed of mostly plain wares (Perttula 2011:50). Grog is the most common temper used for
Early Caddo ceramics, but bone, hematite, and ferruginous sandstone also occur, though almost
exclusively in utility wares (Perttula et al. 2010:23). Perttula (2015:29) notes that pre-AD 1400
assemblages with a high proportion of bone temper (>40% of the assemblage) primarily occur at
sites located in the middle Sabine River basin. Additionally, Perttula (2011:65) describes Caddo
ceramics from the Boxed Springs site (41UR30) in Upshur County as having less than 7 mm
thick walls on average and notes that this is consistent with other Early Caddo assemblages.
Middle Caddo period sites along the middle Red River have been related to the Sanders Phase;
they include dispersed farmsteads and hamlets, along with a few large villages. The period is
characterized by single and multiple earthen mounds that contained burials, some with abundant
and exotic grave goods, indicating the presence of high status individuals (Perttula 1998:19). The
best-known site from this period and in the Red River Watershed in Texas is the T. M. Sanders
site (41LR2), which is located adjacent to the mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek. The site is located
approximately one-half mile south of the Red River and is at an elevation of approximately 450’
amsl. The site includes of two earthen mounds, one of which contained 21 graves, many with
multiple burials, with a wide variety and number of grave goods (Krieger 1946:171-218; Jackson
et al. 2000). Conch shell dippers, gorgets, and shell beads were found with burials at the site, as
well as on the plowed site surface. These correspond to artifacts attributed to the Southeastern
Ceremonial Complex, previously referred to as the Southern Death Cult (Krieger 1946:177;
Waring and Holder 1945; Hamilton 1997; Skinner et al. 1969:106).

Other exotic artifacts recovered from the site include bar gorgets (Harris 1953a), ear spools,
stone pipes, and celts. Some authors (Bruseth et al. 1995; Schambach 1999, 2000) have debated
whether this site was an outpost for the Spiro site in Oklahoma. The Sanders Phase was
characterized by exchange between groups in Northeastern Texas, the South Plains, and the
Mississippian people of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. The material for the polished
Ouachita sandstone elbow pipes could have been collected locally or may indicate trade with
Oklahoma residents. Krieger (1946:194-195) discusses that the houses appear to be four-sided
with one side open. He goes on to state that the fourth side might have been unintentionally
destroyed while excavating, but at least in one instance he was confident that the structure had
three walls and one open side. Agricultural hoes made of freshwater mussel shells and bisonscapula were found at the site (Jackson et al. 2000:34; Krieger 1946:183-184, 194). More recent
investigations at the Sanders site indicate that the site was likely occupied briefly in the Late
Archaic through the Woodland period (Perttula et al. 2015:82). The authors go on to state that
the first principal ancestral Caddo components date to the Middle Caddo (ca. A.D. 1100-1300),
and the material cultural from this period represents the Sanders Phase (Perttula et al. 2015:82).
The final occupation at the site was during the late 17th through mid-18th century, which the
authors state as part of the Womack Phase of the Historic Caddo Period (Perttula et al. 2015:82).
Perttula et al. (2016:87) has recently identified and redefined the ceramic assemblage from the
Sanders site which represents the Middle Caddo Period. There are ten ceramic types, two of
which are newly defined, while another, Sanders Plain, has been redefined as Sanders Slipped
(Perttula et al. 2016:87). Perttula et al. (2016:Table 2) lists Bois d’Arc Plain, Bois d’Arc Plain,
var. Crawford, Canton Incised, East Incised, Haley Engraved, Hickory Engraved, Maxey Noded
Redware, Monkstown Fingernail Impressed, Sanders Engraved, Sanders Incised, and Sanders
Slipped as present in the assemblage from the Sanders site. The principal types are Bois d’Arc
Plain, Sanders Engraved, Maxey Noded Redware, and Sanders Slipped. Sanders Plain was
originally defined by Brown (1996:401-403), and is described as a grog-tempered, slipped, and
undecorated type. However, this is not completely true, as the slipped element is a form of
decoration, therefore Perttula (2016:87) has renamed it Sanders Slipped. Bois d’Arc Plain is
defined as non-slipped plain grog- and/or bone-tempered wares. This new ceramic type is a
distinct class in the form of Bois d’Arc Plain, var. Crawford, where the vessels have scalloped
and cut lips (Perttula et al. 2016:87). Sanders Incised is the last of the newly defined types, and it
refers to vessels with similar decoration as the Sanders Engraved, except that the decoration is
executed in the unfired paste when the vessel was leather-hard (Perttula et al. 2016:87).
Large platform mounds are associated with Middle Caddo times, further indicating socially
complex societies, as inferred from the Sanders site. These sites may include the Harling Mound
(41FN1) in Fannin County (Davis 1962a and b), but also the Mackin Mound (41LR36) in Lamar
County (Mallouf 1976) and the Fasken Mound (41RR1) site in Red River County (Perttula et al.
2001). A more recent analysis of the collections held at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) for the Harling Mound demonstrate that the site was occupied during the
same times as the Sanders site (Perttula 2015c:83). A Middle Caddo shaft burial was reported
from the Bentsen-Clark (41RR41) site in Red River County. According to Banks and Winters
(1975:72), the artifacts associated with the burial in Feature No. 1 are typical of the “Alto,
Sanders, Spiro, and Haley foci” and suggest a tentative date approaching A.D. 1300.

In the Late Caddo period, there is a shift in site location from the major drainages to the
headwaters of smaller tributaries, which resulted in numerous small hamlets scattered throughout
most of Northeastern Texas. However, major sites such as Sam Kaufman ([Roitsch] 41RR16),
Wright Plantation (41RR7), and the Belcher Mound (16CD13) (Harris 1953b; Skinner et al.
1969; Webb 1959; Perttula et al. 2001) were continuously occupied on the banks of the Red
River in Texas and Louisiana during this period. Farming was an important contributor to their
diet (Perttula 2008a). The use of maize peaked during the Late Caddo period as observed in the
isotopic and skeletal records (Wilson 2012; Wilson and Perttula 2013, Perttula et al. 2014).
Materials were traded from the Plains/Southwest to the Texas Gulf Coast (Perttula 1998:12;
Vehik 2002) to the Southeastern United States (Skinner et al. 1969:101, 103). Late Caddo
assemblages continue the trend of diversification, most notably in the expansion of vessel form
types including the incensario form and effigy vessels, along with a wide variety of jar and bowl
forms and an increased use of appliques (Perttula 2013:Figures 10-15). Engraved ceramics
become more ubiquitous during the Late Caddo period in East Texas (Perttula 2015b:22). These
engraved fine wares include McCurtain Phase Avery, Simms, and Hudson Engraved, Texarkana
Phase Barkman, Hatchel, Hodges, Taylor Engraved, and Titus Phase Ripley, Wilder, Bailey, and
Turner engraved, Frankston Phase Poyner Engraved (Perttula 2013:194-198). Additional fine
wares include Keno and Foster Trailed. The period also marks an increased usage of brushed
utility wares, particularly in Frankston and Titus phase sites (Perttula 2015b:23). Shell became a
prominent tempering agent at sites located in the upper Sulphur River and middle Red River
during the Late Caddo period (Perttula 2015b:30). Most of the Late Caddo red-slipped ceramics
have shell temper (Perttula 2015b:23). Many of the traditions and styles that define the Late
Caddo period carry over into the Historic Caddo period in the middle Red River area.
There is a break in the archaeological record for a period of two hundred years, at the end of the
Late Caddo period. There is no evidence of Spanish or French occupation in Fannin or Lamar
counties. The Womack site (41LR1) represents the primary evidence for historic Native
American occupation; it is located on a bluff, overlooking the Red River, in northern Lamar
County (Harris et al. 1965; Schambach 1996). Recent analysis of the collections held at TARL,
demonstrate that the site was occupied ca. A.D. 1700-1730, and the material cultural found at the
site defines the Womack Phase of the Historic Caddo period (Perttula 2015d:31). The Womack
Phase has been identified in the collections from the Sanders, Goss Farm, and Harling Mound
sites (Perttula 2015c:31). Glass trade beads were recovered from individual burials at the Sanders
site (Harris 1953a:20) and 478 glass beads were found on the surface south of the mounds
(Harris and Harris 1967:20; Perttula et al. 2015). Harris also found an effigy-smoking pipe with
the head of a lamb or sheep on the surface near one of the graves (Harris 1953a:20). The pipe is
trade material from the early 1800s (Perttula et al. 2015:77), but the glass beads were dated to the
1700s (Harris and Harris 1967:131; Duffield and Jelks 1961:70-71). A hundred glass trade beads
were also recovered from the Goss Farm site (41FN12 [A1-2]; Harris 1953a:20). Recent analysis
of the Goss Farm collection at TARL confirms that the site has Sanders and Womack phase
artifacts, however, it also appears to contain Late Paleoindian and Woodland occupations
(Perttula 2015a:57).
Based upon the information obtained from the limited previous investigations done, it appears
that Native Americans have repeatedly occupied the area since the Paleoindian period. Artifacts

dating to this period have been identified from the Goss Farm site (Perttula 2015a:57).
Additionally, Perttula’s recent analysis of collections demonstrates that there is some evidence of
Late Archaic occupation at the Sanders site (Perttula et al. 2015:82), and he goes on to say there
is a Woodland occupation at the Sanders, Harling, and Goss Farm sites (Perttula et al. 2015:82;
Perttula 2015a:57 and c:83). The most intense occupation of the area appears to have occurred
during the Sanders Phase of the Middle Caddo and then again during the Womack Phase of the
Historic Caddo until the early 18th century (Perttula et al. 2015:82).
Historic Occupation
Given that there is an overlap of time with the Historic Caddo and Historic European periods,
there is evidence of interaction between the Caddo and Europeans. The first Europeans to
encounter the Caddo people were the remnants of de Soto-Moscoso Entrada between 1542 and
1543 (Girard et al. 2014:102). However, based on the reconstructed path the entrada took
through the Caddo region south of the Arkansas River and into East Texas, it is unlikely that they
had direct contact with the Caddo population living in the Bois d’Arc Creek Watershed. It would
not be until the mid-1600s that more significant interactions between the two groups occurred in
the form of explorers, fur traders, missionaries, and soldiers (Girard et al. 2014:106). Perttula’s
recent work on site collections demonstrates that the Harling, Goss, and Sanders sites have
European trade goods (Perttula et al. 2015b:75; Perttula 2015a:57 and c:81). A single 18th
century blade gun flint, possible kettle fragments, as well as brass tinklers, a Spanish Real coin
(1759-1788), iron spikes, clay pipe fragments with the head of a sheep or lamb, and more than 50
white and blue glass beads have been recovered from the Sanders site (Perttula et al. 2015b:75).
Glass beads and metal buttons were found at the Goss Farm site (Perttula 2015a:57), and glass
beads were also part of the collection associated with the Harling Mound (Perttula 2015c:81).
Based upon these artifacts, it is clear that during the Womack Phase, the Caddo living in the area
had access to or interaction with early Europeans. The various Caddo groups were forcibly
pushed out of East Texas between 1836 and 1839 (Girard et al. 2014:130). While some relocated
to Indian Territory, others moved into the upper Brazos River drainage. This group remained
there until 1859, when they were forced to relocate to the Washita River Valley in Indian
Territory (Girard et al. 2014:130).
Fannin County was created from a portion of Red River County and was one of the first counties
founded in Texas. On December 14, 1837, the Republic of Texas Congress named the county
after James Walker Fannin, Jr., a Texas Revolution hero (Carter 1885; Hodge 1966; Scott 1982;
Strickland 1930; Tate 2001; Pigott 2014). Texas became a state on December 29, 1845, and,
shortly thereafter, the Texas Legislature approved the present boundaries of Fannin County.
Most early settlers of Fannin County were from southern states, particularly North Carolina,
Tennessee, and Kentucky (Strickland 1930; Templin et al. 1946). The original county seat was
located at Old Warren, also known as Fort Kitchen, on the Grayson/Fannin county line. Old
Warren was established in 1836 when Abel Warren, an Indian trader from Fort Smith, Arkansas,
settled there. He built a fort to serve as protection against raiding Indians and a trading post for
friendly tribes (Hodge 1966). Old Warren was home to the first courthouse, school, post office,
and Masonic Lodge in the county. Due to an increased concern over Indian attacks and a
political shift, which strengthened the community of Bois d’Arc the county seat was moved from
Old Warren to the city of Bois d'Arc on January 16, 1843. In 1844, Bois d'Arc was renamed
Bonham (Pigott 2014).

Historically, several tribes inhabited the area: the Cherokee, Tehuacana, Keechi, Waco, Caddo,
Shawnee, and others. Fannin County’s early settlers describe numerous conflicts with the Native
Americans in the area. Stories of Natives murdering and mutilating local residents, as well as
tails of horse and livestock thievery were common along Bois d’Arc Creek (Strickland 1930).
Early accounts state that a Shawnee Village was situated northeast of Bois d’Arc Creek’s
confluence with Honey Grove Creek (Strickland 1930:287; Brune 1981:181). The village was a
mile northeast of the proposed reservoir and due north of the Shiloh Church and Cemetery.
Between 1837 and 1839, tensions escalated between the settlers and Native American groups in
the area. The Shawnee were described in most oral tradition stories, but some conflicts were
described between the Caddo, Choctaw, and Kickapoo (Strickland 1930). According to early
accounts in 1839, Holland Coffee, an early settler, used his prestige and influence to negotiate a
peace treaty with the Natives until they were finally pushed out of the county a few years later
(Strickland 1930:298).
When the Civil War broke out in April 1861, Fannin County’s citizens supported the
Confederacy and secession from the Union. Several companies of men from Fannin County
joined the Trans-Mississippi Confederate army. Bonham was the site of three important
Confederate facilities during the war: a hospital for the soldiers, a commissary which supported
seven brigades and the military headquarters of the Northern Sub-District of Texas, Confederate
States of American (C.S.A.) In addition, Camp Benjamin was established in the Bois d’Arc
Creek floodplain, northeast of Bonham. Camp Benjamin was occupied by the 9th Regiment
Volunteer Texas Infantry from December 13, 1861 until January 1, 1862. At that time, the 10
company regiment left for Memphis, Tennessee (Brothers 2010). Over 1,200 enlisted men and
officers lived at the camp. A concrete cross was erected in 1980 at the reputed location of a
cemetery, where at least seven 9th Regiment soldiers were buried after dying from measles or
pneumonia (Honey Grove Signal-Citizen 1980).
After the Civil War, the county began to prosper; many new businesses opened between 1865
and 1900. Prior to the war, Fannin County was home to five manufacturing plants; by 1870 that
number had increased to 54. In 1872, the Fannin County Bank opened and in 1873 the Texas &
Pacific Railway built its tracks across the county. The county also experienced record growth
thanks to its agricultural economy; the major crops were corn and cotton (Pigott 2014). Between
1860 and 1883, new schools opened to serve the growing population and in 1888, the Fannin
County School Board was organized to educate the county’s children.
The first three decades of the 20th century brought many changes to the county. In 1900, the
population reached a record high of 51,793; farms produced record numbers of swine and
bushels of corn, and over 58-percent of the county was working farmland (Templin et al. 1946).
The number of farms reached over 7,000; 35 percent were owner-occupied farms and the
remainder were tenant farms. Cotton production peaked in 1920, after which production of all
crops began to decline (Templin et al. 1946). Although the 1920s saw a sharp reduction in the
number of dairy cows and milk production, the number of beef cattle began to increase. In 1925,
the Lone Star Gas Company ran natural gas lines through the county. In 1929, Jones Field airport
was built on the north side of Bonham (Pigott 2014).

As in most areas of the United States, the Great Depression of the 1930s imposed economic
hardship on the county’s businesses and residents; a hardship that lasted until World War II. The
number of manufacturing jobs decreased to a record low of 310 and farms were only 46-percent
of their 1920 value. By 1940, the number of farms had dwindled to 4,638, although 83.5 percent
of the county was still working farmland (Templin et al. 1946). Cotton production steadily
decreased from the 1930s through the 1950s and, by 1987, only 337 bales were produced in the
county. Corn production decreased until the late 1980s; wheat, peanuts, and sorghum increased
during the same period. The only livestock to show a continual increase throughout the
remainder of the century was beef cattle. By the end of the century beef cattle outnumbered milk
cows nearly five to one (Pigott 2014). That period between the Great Depression and WWII also
saw the population of the county decrease and then finally stabilize at about 40,000 residents.
The population began to decrease again in the 1950s; by 1970 it had decreased to the population
level of the 1880s. Throughout its history, the county's racial percentages have remained between
10- and 20-percent (Pigott 2014).
In 1955, the remainder of FM 1396 from north of Allen's Chapel, through Carson and Lamasco,
to FM 273 was improved and paved. While the new road provided easy access from the rural
areas to larger communities, such as Honey Grove and Bonham, it reduced the need for tiny,
local communities, which had at one time been invaluable to farmers and ranchers (Pigott 2014).
Between 1947 and 1987, employment in manufacturing companies more than doubled from 15to 37-percent, mostly in the lumber and wood products industry (Pigott 2014). Service industries
also increased, as did the banking, retail, wholesale, construction, utilities, and transportation
industries. These businesses are still prominent in the county’s economy.
Previous Archaeological Investigations in Fannin County
The first archaeological work conducted on the property was in 1930, when a team from the
University of Texas in Austin (UT) excavated several skeletons and recovered a few artifacts
from a prehistoric Caddo site (41FN12) on the Goss Farm near the mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek.
According to the notes housed in the collection at TARL at UT, B.B. Gardner excavated three
burials from the Goss Farm site (TARL 2014). According to Gardner, Burials 1 and 2 were
relatively close together in a flexed position between 45-76 centimeters (cm) below the surface
(cmbs) and contained no funerary objects (Perttula 2015a:52). Burial 3 was 30 m south of the
first two and contained an adult with cranial deformation. Unlike the other two, this burial was
placed in an extended position approximately 30 cmbs (Perttula 2015a:52). The third burial
contained a shell-tempered bowl that was decorated with two sets of two appliqued nodes and
two sets of three appliqued nodes (Perttula 2015a:52). Recently Tim Perttula reanalyzed the
collection in an effort to build a database for Caddo ceramics in Texas. Perttula (2015b) states
that the decoration is similar to that found in the upper Brazos and Red River basins of North
Central Texas identified as Late Prehistoric Southern Plains vessels (i.e., a variety of Nocona
Plain). Additionally, Gardner noted that there were midden deposits and probably a large number
of burials on the Goss Farm alluvial landform (1930:15-19). Gardner also encountered a 15-cmthick ash feature during his excavations that was never fully defined. He believed it could be
evidence of extensive burning from hearths or the remains of a burned structure (Gardner 1930;
Perttula 2015a:52).

In 1931, Gardner and A.T. Jackson from UT, began excavations on the Sanders site on the east
bank of Bois d’Arc Creek across from the Goss Farm. At the time, this was the first major
discovery of Mississippian prestige artifacts found west of the Mississippi River (Jackson et al.
2000:1; Krieger 1946). Overall more than 60 burials were found to contain artifacts including
shell beads, several types of ceramic vessels, gorgets, pipes, ear spools, and numerous dart and
arrow points. After UT finished digging the site, it was revisited various times by avocational
archaeologists from the Dallas Archeological Society. Two of these avocational archeologists,
Rex Housewright and Lester Wilson from Wylie, Texas, visited the Goss and Sanders farms
several times beginning in the 1930s. On one of their visits to the Sanders site in 1937, they,
along with Henry Hanna (1950), uncovered some additional burials (Housewright 1941). The
first burial contained three individuals in the extended supine position facing east. They
encountered the burial while trenching north/south across the burial mound (East Mound also
referred to as Mound 1) approximately 50 ft from its crest. There were two adults and an infant.
The smaller adult was on top of the larger adult. They describe the smaller adult cradling the
infant in its left arm and that both skulls had been badly smashed (Housewright 1941:37). All
were described as being in a red clay matrix and the burial contained funerary objects. The larger
adult had 50 beads near the left elbow and a shell gorget under the chin. No ornaments were
found with the other adult, but the child had a bone hairpin near the skull. It was while
excavating these individuals that they found a fourth individual. However, this burial was
encountered at a slightly shallower depth than the group and was buried in a flexed position. A
bison scapula-digging tool was found near the knees, oriented up as if it had been used to dig the
burial pit. The burial had a shell gorget near the chest, but no other funerary objects were found.
Housewright (1941:38) stated that this was the first flexed burial to be found at the Sanders site
and hypothesized that this burial could have been intrusive. However, he also thought it might
represent a slave who had been buried in the tradition of his own people. While conducting
research on burial customs, he found that Natchez Indians from Mississippi had been described
using a similar custom (Housewright 1941:38). Housewright and Wilson worked closely on
many sites across North Texas and it has been stated that their combined collections could be the
one of the most representative examples of Wylie and Sanders focus artifacts in existence (Harris
and Vance 1989:1). After Wilson passed away in 1988, his dying wish was to have his ashes
scattered over the Lamar County sites, since his favorite Wylie Focus sites were under Lake Ray
Hubbard (Harris and Vance 1989:1).
On one of his many visits, Housewright (1946) describes uncovering a child’s burial at the Goss
Farm. The burial included a necklace of more than 260 turquoise beads and two turquoise
pendants. These were the main details he published in The Record (Housewright 1946).
However, Housewright’s personal notes are now part of the private “Vance-Wilson-Housewright
Collection” in North Texas. While examining his original hand-written notes, it was discovered
that he describes finding the burial on the west bank of Bois d’Arc Creek approximately 150
yards northwest of the large Sanders Mound (West Mound also referred to as Mound 2), which is
on the east side of the creek (Housewright 1940). He states that the burial was north of the crest
on a natural ridge running parallel to the Red River. This description places the site more than
half a mile north of where the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas ([TASA] 2014) shows the Goss
Farm site. This description also matches more closely the one Gardner described as being closer
to the mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek. A few years later in 1951, R.K. Harris visited the Goss Farm
and found nearly 100 trade beads, 75 flint specimens, a turquoise bead, and the base of an early

Plainview-like dart point (Harris 1951:20). A couple years later, Harris (1953a:20) collected a
cache of four mussel shell hoes from the site. It was this cache that convinced him that mussel
shell was used by prehistoric populations as hoes. He described the mussel shells as being wellworn and polished on the digging edge. Based upon Perttula’s (2015a:57) recent analysis of the
Goss Farm collection, the site contains artifacts dating from the Late Paleoindian and Woodland
periods, then during the Sanders Phase (A.D. 1100-1300) of the Middle Caddo period and most
intensely during the Womack Phase (ca. late 17th to early 18th century) of the Historic Caddo
period (Perttula 2015a:57).
In August of 1950, the Harling Mound (41FN1), then referred to as the Morgan Mound, was first
visited by archaeologists R. L. Stephenson, E. O. Miller, and Lester Wilson (TARL 2015;
Perttula 2015c:71). They describe an abundance of artifacts on the surface in the plowed fields.
They also note that the mound was heavily overgrown with trees and had never been cultivated.
This description would match the 1937 and 1948 aerials, which appear to show the mound as a
dark spot surrounded by cropland. Based on this information it appears Morgan never farmed the
mound. The crew also noted that there was a historic cemetery dating to the early 19th century on
the mound surface (TARL 2015; Perttula 2015c:76). Additional research into the collection
revealed that in 1963, a portion of a Beal headstone was in the collection. This cemetery on top
of the mound represents the missing Beal Cemetery. The skeletal collection contains ten
individuals, which were partially excavated by E. Mott Davis in 1960, and then by J.R. Gipson in
1963 (TARL 2015, Perttula 2015c:76).
After the initial visit in 1950, the site was later investigated in 1959 by archaeologists from UT
(TARL 2014). Curtis Tunnell first visited the site in 1959, where he and Lathel Duffield mapped
the mound as approximately 230 ft long, 170 ft wide, and 7 ft high (Tunnell 1959). E. Mott
Davis conducted limited excavations on the mound in 1960 (Davis 1962a and 1962b). During the
excavations, no prehistoric burials were found, but ceramics recovered dated to the Sanders
Phase. His notes at TARL (2015) describe that they encountered a couple of historic burials in
the top of the mound. According to Davis (1962b:489), the mound was likely constructed in one
phase. He estimated that the UT team excavated approximately eight percent of the cubic content
of the mound. Davis speculated that the mound functioned as a frontier outpost for the Caddo
and tribes of the plains (Davis 1962b:480). The excavation was prompted by R. A. Harling’s
desire to level the mound to improve his ability to farm the area. A final report on this
investigation was never written and it appears the site was destroyed, as a letter from Mr.
Harling, dated January 10, 1963, states that the demolition had begun, and the site was
completely destroyed. Perttula (2015b) concluded that the site was first occupied during the
Woodland period and then more substantially by ancestral Caddo groups. Artifacts analyzed in
the collection include 475 ceramic sherds, a ceramic pipe sherd, chipped stone tools, ground
stone tools, and a glass bead. Additionally, Perttula (2015b) had three radiocarbon samples dated
for the site, which confirm Middle to Historic Caddo occupation at the site.
According to TASA (2014), the first recorded professional survey in Fannin County was
conducted in 1960 for the proposed Brushy Creek Reservoir, now called Valley Lake, located
near Bells, TX in west central Fannin County. During the survey, several prehistoric lithic
scatters were recorded (Davis et al. 1962); they range in age from the Archaic to Caddo. Ground
stone fragments were also found at one site.

The Texas State Building Commission (now the Texas Historical Commission) and the Texas
State Water Development Board performed an archaeological survey of the proposed Timber
Creek and Bois d’Arc Reservoirs in 1968 (Hsu 1968). Timber Creek Lake became Lake
Bonham. Two sites (41FN15 and 41FN16) were discovered during the survey of Timber Creek
Reservoir. Site 41FN15 consisted of a lithic scatter, a Scallorn point, two Gary points, and a
potsherd. A Gary point and lithic scatter made up site 41FN16. Both sites were found on the
edge of the first terrace of Timber Creek.
Bois d’Arc Reservoir was not constructed; the proposed dam location was upstream from the
present LBCR location. Thirteen sites (41FN17 through 41FN29) were found adjacent to Bois
d’Arc Creek, approximately seven miles southwest of Bonham. Sites were found on knolls
within the floodplain and on terraces adjacent to Bois d’Arc Creek. Sites contained mussel shells,
animal bones, pottery, flakes, arrow and dart points, celts, axes, fire-cracked rock (FCR), and
even evidence of human burials. It is important to note that these sites were found either eroding
out of creek banks or on the surface of plowed fields. A comprehensive survey was not done.
One site of particular interest (41FN19) is located on a knoll adjacent to the old Bois d’Arc
Creek channel (Hsu 1968:11-12). The knoll, and presumably the site, is 300 m long by 50 m
wide. Hsu’s collection included two projectile points, two sherds, and lithic debris. The
landowner had collected a small ground hematite axe, a polished full groove axe, the proximal
half of a polished cylindrical celt, and two incised sherds from the site surface. These sites
ranged in age from the Middle Archaic to the Caddo. Since subsurface testing was not part of
this survey, there is no substantive information about the potential of finding buried cultural
resources in the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain. However, numerous avocational archaeologists
have reported finding dart points in the eroding channel bed.
In 1989, Southern Methodist University (Jurney et al. 1989) conducted an archaeological
evaluation of three units of the Caddo Grasslands in Fannin County. According to their report,
the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain has high potential for prehistoric archaeological sites, while the
valley slope has a medium potential (Jurney et al. 1989:Figure 33). Figure 34, in the report,
showed that the uplands have a high potential for historic sites. The authors stated that the areas
of low potential for historic sites are too far removed from historic transportation routes such as
roads and railroads. Additionally, the bottomlands appear to have a medium potential for historic
sites, such as crossings or mills, since flooding prevented domestic occupation (Jurney et al.
1989:123).
In 2005, ARC (Skinner et al. 2005) investigated approximately 1,700 acres at the proposed
location of Lake Ralph Hall, which will be constructed in Fannin County, north of Ladonia, in
the North Sulphur River floodplain. Seventeen historic and prehistoric sites were recorded in the
course of the survey (41FN60 through 41FN76). ARC recommended further testing for a Middle
to Late Archaic campsite (41FN68), a deeply buried Middle Archaic campsite (41FN66), and
near the cobble core/chopper tool site (41FN73). The date for the core/chopper may be older than
10,860±40 B.P. (Beta 206953). Further survey should lead to the discovery of more deeply
buried archaeological sites (Bousman and Skinner 2007).

Various small-scale surveys have been conducted throughout Fannin County. Most of these
studies have found little or no evidence of prehistoric or historic occupation. ARC surveyed for
the South Wastewater Interceptor in Bonham, which tested in the Bois d’Arc Creek floodplain,
as well as on the upland toe slope and the overlooking upland ridge, but did not find sites in
those settings (Skinner and Davis 2009).
In the surrounding counties, major investigations have been conducted in the South Sulphur
River valley at Cooper Lake in Delta and Hopkins counties. Survey, testing, and site excavation
were carried out along Sanders Creek just to the east of Bois d’Arc Creek at Pat Mayse Reservoir
and at Camp Maxey. Pine Creek is just to the east and studies have been conducted there at
Crook Lake, B&B Landfill, and at the Gene Stallings Ranch near Powderly. The Womack site, a
historic Native American site, is located adjacent to the Red River channel in northwest Lamar
County. Further to the east in Red River County, survey was conducted at Big Pine Reservoir
and test excavations were conducted at the Mackin Mound site. The Texas Archeological Society
(TAS) conducted summer field schools at the Sam Kaufman site in the early 1990s subsequent to
site discovery and major excavation at the site in 1968. TAS also excavated the Ray site in
Lamar County. In adjacent parts of Oklahoma, relevant site information is available from
excavations at Hugo Reservoir, McGee Creek Reservoir, and Pine Creek Reservoir.
More recently and the most relevant survey conducted in the area, was that done by ARC for the
LBCR project area in 2011 and 2013 (Davis et al. 2014). The proposed reservoir will inundate
16,526 acres of Bois d’Arc Creek’s floodplain and terraces. The project’s research design
focused on three major research topics: Late Pleistocene Geomorphology, The Shifting Ecotone,
and Settling Into the Region (Skinner et al. 2010). The research design developed a sampling
strategy that focused on landforms likely to have been occupied prehistorically and historically.
Approximately 4,500 acres were surveyed. The survey was amplified by walking approximately
40 miles (500 acres) of creek channels, bringing the survey acreage total to 5,000 acres. A total
of 58 sites (28 prehistoric, 26 historic, and four prehistoric/historic) were recorded (Davis et al.
2014:377). Additionally, 38 standing structures were found to meet the historic-age guidelines;
these were evaluated for eligibility for listing on the NRHP. None were found to be eligible for
the NRHP. The results of the survey demonstrated that the earliest occupation was during the
Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods, but the terrace sediments were flushed out of the valley
before 2000 B.C. In situ occupation during the Late Archaic and Woodland periods was
sporadic. Early Caddo occupation may have occurred about A.D. 1000 and only minimal
evidence of later Caddo occupation was found. The majority of the historic sites date to the late
19th to mid-20th century. Oral histories confirm that most 19th century residences were removed
to increase farm and pasture land or were replaced by modern structures.
Additionally, ARC conducted a survey of the LBCR mitigation property that extends south from
the Red River, down the Fannin and Lamar county line (Davis et al. 2015). Overall, 3,670 acres
were surveyed. A total of 87 sites (20 prehistoric, 55 historic, and 11 multicomponent) are
recorded on the property. Twenty-eight structures were found to meet the historic-age guideline
as established for this project and were evaluated. None of them maintained the level of integrity
required to be considered for listing in the NRHP. No evidence of Paleoindian sites was found on
the ranch, and the majority of the prehistoric sites identified could not be dated and likely
represent the ephemeral remains of Archaic period sites. However, several sites were found to

22

possibly date to the Woodland, but more likely date to the prehistoric Caddo periods. The
majority of the historic sites date to the 20th century, with the exception of cemeteries.
Recently a preliminary survey was conducted by archaeologists for Mr. Witcher where four
archaeological sites (41FN176, 41FN177, 41FN178, and 41FN179) were identified on his
property (Perttula et al. 2015a). The report suggests that these four sites have evidence of Late
Paleoindian occupation to Middle Caddo occupation (Perttula et al. 2015a:10). This information
is largely based on the collection of one local collector who has been collecting these sites for the
past 5 years, according to the site forms submitted to TARL (2015). STs were excavated at two
of these sites (41FN177 and 41FN178). 41FN177 (South Pasture Site) had 18 STs with 12 being
positive for prehistoric artifacts. Artifacts recovered from the STs include 29 pieces of lithic
debris, one ceramic sherd (identified as Williams Plain), one arrow point fragment, and one piece
of FCR (Perttula et al. 2015a:7). All artifacts were found in the top 40 cmbs. Additionally, the
local collector has recovered a variety of arrow and dart points (including one Late Paleoindian
Dalton point), ceramics, a celt fragment, and scrapers when walking the site after it has been
plowed (Perttula et al. 2015a:7). Site 41FN178 (North Ridge Site) had three STs excavated and
all were positive for prehistoric artifacts, which included lithic debris, a ceramic sherd, charred
nutshell fragment, and FCR (Perttula et al. 2015a:4). The collector reported finding numerous
artifacts, including a Late Archaic dart point, and decorated ceramics dating to Early and Middle
Caddo occupations. Perttula reported in correspondence to Mr. Witcher, that he had obtained a
Direct-AMS radiocarbon date of 952+25 B.P., or A.D. 998+25 (D-AMS 11793) on a charred
nutshell from 41FN178, which dates to the Early Caddo period (Witcher personal
communication, 2015; Perttula 2016b). Site 41FN176 was only inspected and was described as
having a few artifacts on the surface with the collector reporting a Caddo ceramic sherd from the
area (Perttula et al. 2015a:9). It is unclear whether the final site, 41FN179, was actually visited
by the crew, as it is described as being 300 m south of 41FN177 in the report (Perttula et al.
2015a:10), but was reported to TARL (2015) as being 340 m to the southwest which is on a
property owned by NTMWD. The site form and report both state that the site is on property
owned by Mr. Witcher, but both described locations place the site on property owned by
NTMWD. This site was reported to the crew by the collector as a Woodland period site based on
the artifacts collected. No site boundaries were submitted for any of the sites. Based on this
information, the authors believe the sites date from the Paleoindian period through at least the
Middle Caddo period.
Historic Aerial and Map Review
A variety of historic maps were available for analysis of the LBCR Witcher Property study area,
these include a 1936 and 1961 General Highway Map (GHM) of Fannin County, the 1939
Fannin County Soil Map (FCSM), the 1949 Honey Grove, Texas 15’ U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) topographic map, and the 1984 Selfs, Texas 7.5’ USGS topographic map. All these
maps show structures and roads throughout the LBCR project area. While the 1936 GHM shows
no structures within the LBCR Witcher Property study area, several are shown to the west along
the county roads. The 1939 FCSM shows a structure just outside of the study area, but not
within. The 1949 USGS maps shows the same structure from the 1939 map, however, the better
accuracy of the 1949 map show the structure is farther west away from the LBCR Witcher
Property study area. No structures were within the study area on the 1949 map. Only one

structure is mapped in the study area on the 1984 USGS map, which is in the far northwest
corner.
In addition to reviewing the historic maps, a variety of historic aerials were available for review
including the 1937/38, 1949, 1950, 1963, 1976, 1995, 1996, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014.
The 1937/38 Tobin aerials show the largest forested areas being present in the east portion of the
property along Bois d’Arc Creek, in the very north part, and along the short drainage that runs
through the center of the study area. Most of the study area appears to be cleared and used for
agricultural purposes. The property remained same through 1950. However, the 1963 aerial
shows that some of pastures being reclaimed by dense vegetation. No structures were present on
the property through the 1963 aerial. A structure first appears on the 1976 aerial near the mapped
location of the 1984 USGS structure. In 1995, much of the dense vegetation along the central
creek and the eastern portion along Bois d’Arc Creek were cleared. Only the northern part of the
property remained densely wooded. In the early 2000s, Mr. Witcher built his home near the
center of the study area. According to Fannin County Appraisal District, the home was built in
2000. Mr. Witcher (personal communication, 2015) confirmed this information saying he bought
the property around 1999 or 2000 and was living in the home by 2001. He also stated that he
believed the pole barn in the northwest corner was likely built in the late 1960s or 1970s,
consistent with the aerial imagery.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The comprehensive research design guided field research and laboratory analysis done in
conjunction with archaeological investigations in the reservoir area (Skinner et al. 2010). The
document presented research topics which provided a foundation for directing and interpreting
the findings of the sample survey of the LBCR. Broad ranging statements about the archaeology
of the Eastern Planning Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Sections I and II) provided a
foundation for relating the archaeology to the environment in Fannin County. The THC planning
document was used to develop three historic contexts for the project: Late Pleistocene
Geomorphology, The Shifting Ecotone, and Settling Into the Region (Skinner et al. 2010:20;
Davis et al. 2014:26). The floodplains were classified as having a generally low archaeological
potential for occupations while the upland and Pleistocene terrace edges were considered to have
a high potential for both historic and prehistoric archaeological sites. Steep slopes on the south
side of the Bois d’Arc Creek valley and southern tributaries discouraged settlement; the southern
drainages only carry rainfall runoff, unlike some of the spring-fed northern tributaries.
The majority of the Witcher Property study area is on a second terrace overlooking the Bois
d’Arc Creek floodplain. Numerous archaeological sites were recorded on this landform during
the LBCR study (Davis et al. 2014:Figure 77). Prehistoric sites 41FN110, 41FN118, 41FN120,
41FN122, 41FN123, and 41FN151 are immediately southwest of the Witcher Property along the
leading edge of the terrace (Perttula et al. 2015a). The locations of sites 41FN176, 41FN177, and
41FN178 are shown on Figure 6 below, which is Figure 3 in the Witcher Property survey report
(Perttula et al. 2015a). This figure shows the relative locations of the STs dug at sites 41FN177
and 41FN178, but no information was provided about the locations or matrix composition of
surrounding negative STs. Likewise, centroid locations are not illustrated on the map nor are
they discussed in the text. Consequently, it was impossible to relate their ST locations to the
locations of the numerous STs that ARC excavated.
These nine sites are tentatively dated from the Woodland to Early or Middle Caddo periods.
Artifacts recovered from these sites included undecorated Caddo ceramics, lithic debris, dart and
arrow points, plant and animal remains, and FCR. Based on this information, it was expected that
similar prehistoric sites would be found along the leading terrace edge, especially on the north
side of the small drainage that crosses through the LBCR Witcher study area. These sites would
likely contain dateable materials and could have intact features below the plow zone with similar
artifact assemblages. Furthermore, the four sites in study area needed to be systematically
delineated and evaluated.
It had been predicted that historic residences and sites would be found within a hundred feet of
present and past roadways. Based upon the historic map and aerial review, one structure was
present on the 1976 aerials and on the 1984 USGS topographic map in the study area. Previous
investigations of the LBCR study area documented nearly a dozen historic sites on the same
terrace landform all adjacent to roadways. All these historic sites represented early- to mid-20th
century homesteads, some with structures but most without. The sites without remaining
residential structures typically contained foundations, subterranean features, pole barns, sheet
trash middens, cisterns, or wells. Additionally, it was expected that historic artifact scatters could
be found adjacent to historic road or drainages.

Methodology
Field methods were designed to define site boundaries and gather more comprehensive baseline
information about the known sites and locate and record any cultural resources found on the
LBCR Witcher study area. Data collection methods included pedestrian survey with shovel
testing and archival and oral history research. An inventory of sites present in the survey area
provides information regarding site distribution and density, site size and deposit depth, artifact
assemblages, ecofact preservation, and dating potential. ARC used this information to develop
recommendations for further cultural resource investigations, which might include testing and
mitigation of sites that are eligible for listing on the NRHP or as SALs.
In the survey area, the field crew walked parallel and individually numbered transects, spaced 25
m apart. Notes on ground exposure, soil types, and topographic settings encountered were made
for each section. STs were excavated approximately every 100 meters (m) along the transects.
The STs were staggered between transects to achieve practical spacing of 50 m. STs were further
concentrated where artifacts were present on the surface or on topographic rises, ridge tops,
knolls, and on terrace edges. On average, almost three STs per acre (actually 2.97) were
excavated in these high potential terrace sediments. All STs were approximately 30 cm in
diameter, excavated in 10 cm levels, and extended to the bottom of the Holocene deposit (THC
n.d.). Clay soils were inspected visually, broken and hand-sorted, while sandy soils were
screened through ¼ inch hardware cloth to determine if cultural materials were present. Each ST
was recorded on a standardized form that described the sediment thickness, texture/composition,
color (Munsell Soil Color Chart 2010), and recorded the number and types of artifacts. The
locations were recorded using handheld global positioning system (GPS) units. Subsurface
artifacts were collected in 10 cm levels for analysis. Temporally and functionally diagnostic
artifacts located on the surface would have been mapped and collected for analysis had they been
found. Photographs were taken using GPS enabled digital cameras. For the four previously
recorded sites with no associated site boundaries, field crews began by excavating five STs near
the reported site centroids. The first was excavated at the reported centroid, with four additional
STs 10 m away in the cardinal directions. The placement of these four STs would place them 15
m from the STs on the larger survey grid. STs were not dug further than 25 m apart on any of the
sites.

RESULTS
The results of the LBCR Witcher study area survey are presented in three sections. The terrain,
environmental setting, and general survey results for the project area are described first, followed
by a discussion of the archaeological sites documented during the project. The final section
presents conclusions with regard to the results of the survey. Descriptions for all STs are
presented in Appendix A, and the positive STs are described throughout the chapter in each
specific site description.
Survey Results
The LBCR Witcher study area is located on the second terrace overlooking the Bois d’Arc Creek
floodplain. The creek is approximately 400 m east. The gently rolling terrace surface is highest
in the western portion of the study area at 510’ amsl. It gradually drops in elevation to the east
where the leading edge of the terrace is generally at 500’ amsl. The edge of the adjacent
floodplain averages 490’ amsl. A small intermittent tributary divides the property into a northern
and southern pasture. The drainage flows east/northeast into Bois d’Arc Creek. The majority of
the property has been cleared of brush and has been farmed for decades. Dense relatively young
forest vegetation is along the floodplain edge on the north and east. The drainage bisecting the
study area contained a scattered growth of mainly older oak and pecan trees. The dense
vegetation along the floodplain consisted of younger oak, hackberry, pecan, and cedar elm trees
along with poison ivy and greenbriar. The northern and southern pastures had ankle to calf-high
grasses that were being grazed. Ground visibility throughout the pastures was between 0 and 50
percent and was slightly higher in the wooded areas; this however did not reveal surface artifacts.
Soils in the higher elevations along the top of the terrace were consistent with the Porum and
Derly series of loams. These silty and sandy loams typically were 20 to 40 cm thick, overlaying
subsoils with higher clay content. A reddish yellow or dark yellowish brown clay or sandy clay
was typically reached between 40 and 60 cmbs. STs excavated at the edge of the floodplain were
consistent with Tinn clay and had between 20 and 30 cm of dark gray clayey loam above darker
and fatter clay.
A total of six archaeological sites (3 prehistoric, 2 historic, and 1 multicomponent) were
documented during the survey and 454 STs were excavated in the 156-acre study area. Of those,
11 percent (49 STs) contained artifacts (Figure 7 and Figure 8). During this investigation, ARC
revisited the four previously reported site locations to define the site boundaries and also
recorded three new sites (41FN244, 41FN245, and 41FN246). One previously recorded site,
41FN179, was found to be erroneously plotted and the site was not relocated. The historic map
and aerial review demonstrated that the only structure on the property was built between 1963
and 1976. Mr. Witcher was asked about the pole barn (Figure 9) and he thought it had been built
in the late 1960s or 1970s, but was not sure, since he had only lived on the property since 2001.
Fannin County Appraisal District records lists the building but has no construction date. Based
upon the construction methods and materials, it appears the structure was likely built in the
1970s. Given the ephemeral nature of the structure and the fact it is similar to numerous other
pole barns in the LBCR area, it was not evaluated as a historic structure.

Three STs contained artifacts that were determined to be isolated occurrences (IOs) given that
surrounding testing was all negative (Table 2). A single interior chert flake was found in ST29-1,
Level 2 in the northwest portion of the study area. The second IO was found in ST3-11 where a
piece of FCR and a chert secondary flake were found in Level 1. The third IO, a single piece of
unidentified metal, was found in ST21-1 in compact sandy clay at a depth of 30-40 cm. This
metal fragment is north of site 41FN245 near the west central part of the survey area.

by a discussion of the site survey findings.
41FN176
Site 41FN176 (the JL site) was recorded by Mark Walters on July 19, 2015. Five pieces of
undiagnostic lithic debris were found in a 10 sq. m eroded area (Figure 10) that roughly parallels
the 480’ amsl contour shown on Figure 11. The site was described as being 20 m by 20 m in size
with artifacts eroding out of the top 30 cm of sand that rests on sterile orange clay. A single grogtempered utility ware ceramic sherd with three rows of tool punctation was found on the site
surface and is in the John Loschke Artifact Collection (hereafter JL Collection). Perttula
describes the sherd as being ancestral Caddo in origin. No shovel testing was done at the site
when it was first recorded. The site centroid appears to have been placed at the upslope edge of
the eroded area. In the site survey form, Walters characterizes the site as a probable Caddo
farmstead with dwellings and activity areas.

The eroded area was re-inspected on October 29, 2015 by the ARC team and no additional
artifacts were noted at the site or on the surface in the surrounding area. Systematic shovel
testing at 10 m intervals around the site centroid recovered artifacts (Table 3) from one ST but
the other four were sterile (Figure 11). Two additional positive STs contained artifacts but the
surrounding nine STs were sterile. Shovel testing revealed an average depth of 29-55 cm to
subsoil. The artifacts recovered were undiagnostic lithic debris, no ceramics or organic materials
were encountered. Based on shovel testing and the eroded terrace edge exposure, it is estimated
that the site is a linear deposit that is 100 m long and no more than 50 m wide covering 3,974 sq.
meters (0.98 acres) with artifacts dispersed throughout the matrix. Artifact density is low with an
average of 1.33 artifacts per 10 cm level in the three positive STs. Negative STs west of the
positives STs demonstrated that artifacts are not present back from the terrace edge. Shovel
testing confirmed the depth of the loamy topsoil but also demonstrated that artifacts appear to
have moved vertically into the sandy clay subsoil as revealed in ST 4-3.1, which was located
downslope at the floodplain edge. No evidence of a trash midden deposit or of features such as
house floors or subterranean pit walls was noted at this described Early to Middle Caddo site.
Overall, the site is a low-density prehistoric deposit with no obvious vertical or horizontal
integrity. Additional shovel testing is needed to determine if the site is eligible for the NRHP or
as an SAL.

41FN177
Site 41FN177 (South Pasture site) is a prehistoric site described as having more than 160
artifacts, which were collected from the plowed field surface. The setting is relatively level
terrace sediments of Porum loam (Figure 12). The JL Collection from the site surface includes 17
arrow points and point fragments, a siliceous shale celt, 52 dart points, two scrapers, a Late
Paleoindian Dalton dart point, 66 biface fragments, and 22 ceramic sherds. According to the
Perttula et al. (2015a:9) report, the artifacts represent Late Paleoindian, Late Archaic, Woodland,
and Early Caddo occupation of the site. The site area was explored initially by Perttula’s team
through the excavation of 18 STs, twelve of which contained artifacts. The upper sandy loam, or
A-horizon, ranged in thickness from 12 to 45 cm but was generally 20 cm thick and rested on
orange or strong brown clay subsoil. Shovel testing recovered 29 pieces of lithic debris, one
ceramic sherd, an arrow point fragment, and a piece of FCR. Unfortunately, ST locations are not
presented in a format (see Figure 6 in this report) that made it possible to integrate the two shovel
testing efforts. It is stated in the report that the site covered an estimated 8,000 sq. meters (ca.
two acres) but the site size is reported on the site form as 80 by 60 m (about one acre). However,
Figure 3 in the Perttula et al. (2015a) report indicates that an oval site deposit, oriented roughly
northwest/southeast, and covers about 1.25 acres. In any case, artifacts are in the sandy surface
deposit, but the concentrated and extensive testing is not reported to have revealed any artifact
concentrations or recognizable midden features.
ARC tested at 10 m intervals at and around the reported location of the site centroid but found no
artifacts in the five STs (Figure 13). Two positive STs were dug at 25 m intervals west of the
centroid but the six surrounding STs were devoid of cultural materials (Table 4). Based on this
information, the subsurface site area is estimated to be oval in shape and to be 65 m by 50 m,
thus including 2,710 sq. meters (0.67 acres). Only six pieces of unmodified lithic debris were
recovered from the two positive STs. Artifacts were found in top 60 cmbs. This low-density
contrasts with the mantle of tools and ceramics found on the surface, now in the JL Collection.
Consequently, it is concluded that farming and subsequent erosion resulted in the destruction of
unknown features, possibly including trash middens, and the loss of sediments, which contained
them. Unfortunately, the remaining buried site deposit reveals a very low-density scatter of
largely non-diagnostic artifacts, even though the surface collection presents evidence of Late

Paleoindian, Late Archaic, Woodland, and Early Caddo artifacts at the site. Based on the
conflicting information gathered by the two shovel testing exercises, it is recommended that
further systematic shovel testing be conducted to determine if significant buried site deposits are
present at the site.

41FN178
The North Ridge site is shown to be located north of site 41FN177 at the same elevation (Figure
14) and set back from the terrace edge (Perttula et al. 2015a:2-5). Surface artifacts in the JL
Collection include 25 dart points, two chipped stone drills, a groundstone tool, two celts, two
arrowheads, a large chipped stone biface, and a single tool punctated/grog-tempered
Early/Middle Caddo ceramic sherd. The dart points indicate Late Archaic and Woodland and
Early Caddo occupations along with Williams Plain sherds described by Perttula et al. (2015a:9).
Three positive STs were excavated on the terrace crest and they revealed 19-24 cm of brown
sandy loam resting on orange clay. Artifacts from the STs included 15 pieces of lithic debris, 4
pieces of FCR, a plain body sherd, and 3 pieces of charred nutshells. Perttula reported in
correspondence with Mr. Witcher, that he had obtained a radiocarbon date of 952±25 B.P., or
A.D. 998±25 from Direct-AMS in Bothell, Washington (D-AMS 11793) on charred nutshell
from the site (Witcher personal communication, 2015, Perttula 2016b). The 2-sigma calibration
of this sample is A.D. 1090±67, which dates to the Early Caddo period (Perttula 2016b:1-2). It
was estimated that the site covers 1-2 acres (Perttula et al. 2015a:4) but the site form describes
the site as being 40 by 40 m (0.4 acres). On the one hand, the soils are described on the site form
as being “undisturbed”, while at the same time the JL Collection was gathered after the site had
been plowed and thus the soil had been disturbed. Based on the site report, it is possible that
there could be a midden deposit located on the terrace edge in the area of ST A and B.

Overview of 41FN178 looking northeast towards top of terrace.

When ARC arrived at the site centroid, it was apparent that the site setting is not only at the
eastern edge of the level terrace but that the terrace edge extends downslope to the edge of the
floodplain, which largely corresponds with the mapped tree line. Testing began at the site
centroid, which may correspond to one of Perttula’s positive STs. Artifacts were encountered in
this ST (Table 5), but no artifacts were found in the four STs that were dug at 10 m distances
around the centroid (Figure 15). A single ST to the southwest was positive. Eleven STs at 25 m
spacing along the terrace edge contained artifacts. Two negative STs are included inside the
estimated site boundary, which covers an area of 16,435 sq. meters (4.06 acres). Twenty-six
negative STs were used to define the limits of the buried site deposit. Additional outlier STs
further confirmed the site boundary.

As with Perttula’s STs, lithic debris was the most common artifact class found in the ARC STs.
Nine flakes and chips were fine-grained quartzite and four were chert. An Alba arrow point
(Figure 16) made of chert was recovered at the base of the slope in ST 4-4 at a depth of 60-70
cm. The Alba arrow point likely dates to the Early/Middle Caddo (Turner et al. 2011:77; Perttula
et al. 2015b:82). Four small slivers of unidentifiable animal bone were encountered in the ST
matrices at the toe of the terrace slope between 10-40 cm and two pieces of charcoal were
collected from two STs with sediments containing artifacts. No Native American ceramics were
recovered and this low ceramic density relative to lithic debris/chipped stone tools compares
favorably to Perttula’s artifact findings and those in the JL Collection. Based on the information
from shovel testing and the JL Collection, it is concluded that occupation at site 41FN178
occurred from the Late Archaic to the Early/Middle Caddo. Given the organic preservation and
the potential for unknown features, it is recommended that testing will be necessary to determine
if site 41FN178 is eligible under Criterion D for the NRHP and as an SAL.

The SH site was initially reported on the basis of the examination of artifacts collected from the
site surface and are in the JL Collection. The collection includes 26 dart points and a chipped
stone biface. The identified dart points include seven Gary and two Kent specimens, which
indicate that the site has a Woodland component. The Perttula team did not visit the site and the
centroid was not recorded in the field. Based on the plotted location of the site submitted to
TARL, the site centroid is on NTMWD property. This location was submitted to TARL and later
confirmed by original submitters to be located as shown on Figure 8 and Appendix B. Although,
their report describes the site being 300 m south of 41FN177 (Perttula et al. 2015:10), which
would place the site on the south side of a large stock pond on Mr. Witcher’s property and on
NTMWD’s property. During ARC’s survey, Mr. Witcher (personal communication, 2015)
described this area south of the stock pond as a place he thought artifacts were found by

Loschke. ARC doubled ST efforts in this area as shown on Figure 7; however, all STs were
negative. The fence line near the reported site centroid represents the property line between the
Witcher and the NTMWD land and is lined by trees that include bois d’arc and oak. Ground
visibility west of the fence line was between 30 and 60 percent (Figure 17). No shovel tests were
excavated on the NTMWD property south of the stock pond, as the site was described as being
on the Witcher property and did not match the information sent to TARL (Appendix B). Given
the description from the report, additional shovel tests should be excavated during the next phase
of work conducted on the NTMWD property south of Mr. Witcher.

Figure 17.

The reported site location is west of the fence beyond the bois d’arc tree and on
NTMWD property.

Shovel testing on the NTMWD side of the fence line, where the site centroid was reported to
TARL, encountered taller vegetation consisting of weeds and scrub brush. Using the centroid as
a guide, the ARC team dug 13 STs in the immediate area, one of which was at the reported
centroid location, at 10, 15, and 25 meter intervals all on NTMWD property (Figure 18). No
cultural materials were encountered, even in the seven additional STs excavated on Mr.
Witcher’s property. It is ARC’s conclusion that the reported artifacts were not from this location.
ARC conducted further testing in the adjacent southwest corner, the south-central part, and the
southeastern corner of Mr. Witcher’s property but found no prehistoric artifacts. These tested
areas include settings on the terrace edge and being 300 m south of site 41FN177 as described in
the previous survey report (Perttula et al. 2015a:10) and as described by Mr. Witcher. ARC had
no success in pinpointing the origin of the JL Collection artifacts from site 41FN179. Based on
the reported location of 41FN179 and the numerous STs excavated in the area, the site was not
relocated and the area on NTMWD property south of the stock pond should be shovel tested
during the next phase of work.

Reported locations of site 41FN179 shown on a recent aerial photograph.

41FN244
This site is located in the northern pasture along the eastern terrace edge overlooking the Bois
d’Arc Creek floodplain. The Perttula team apparently did not survey in this area. The terrace had
not been plowed in several years, but it certainly has been plowed in the past (Figure 19). The
gently rolling terrain was covered with ankle-high grasses at the time of survey and artifacts
were not visible on the ground surface. Eighty-two STs were excavated into the Porum loam in
order to define the buried site deposit (Figure 20). A tree-lined drainage swale originates just east
of the north end of the site deposit and then drains east and northeast before crossing the Bois
d’Arc Creek floodplain. The site is approximately 440 m northwest/southeast by 230 m east/west
and covers an estimated 35,749 sq. meters (8.83 acres) as shown in Figure 20. Eighty-four
artifacts were recovered from 23 positive STs (Table 6 and Table 7). The topsoil consisted of
dark-grayish brown to brown sandy loam and some sandy clay. The topsoil generally ranged in
thickness up to 40 cm and rested on brown to reddish brown clay over most of the level terrace
surface. The terrace slope is not as steep as at site 41FN178 and there is not a deeply buried
midden at the more gradual toe slope. ST 7-8 presents an unexpected configuration in that it
presents two deposition zones: 20-30 cm and 50-80 cm. Charcoal in the lower deposit should
provide a datable early context that may be temporally distinct from more recent prehistoric
occupation contained in the sediments that are preserved at the bottom of the plow zone
throughout the site.

The largest number of the artifacts came from the top 10 cmbs; nearly 86 percent came from the
top 40 cm as shown in Table 6. The artifact assemblage includes 41 chipped stone, 12 pieces of
metal, five Native American ceramics, and 23 samples. The samples consist of two pieces of
burned clay, seven pieces of FCR, and 14 charcoal samples. The metal was all unidentifiable.
The chipped stone assemblage contained two fine-grained quartzite cobble cores, 36 pieces of
lithic debitage, two biface fragments, and an Alba arrow point (Figure 20). The lithic debris
contained a variety of chips, flakes, and shatter. The majority of the lithic debitage was 19 pieces
of fine-grained quartzite and 16 pieces of chert, but a single petrified wood chip was identified.
The two bifaces were both in very early stages of reduction. The Alba arrow point (Figure 21 and
Table 8) was recovered from 10-20 cmbs of ST 3-9 and dates to the Early/Middle Caddo (Turner
et al. 2011:77; Perttula et al. 2015b:82).

Detailed Analysis

The ceramic assemblage includes five analyzed sherds collected from 10-30 cmbs in two STs as
well as two sherdlets. The sherds were analyzed using descriptive terms and attributes from the
Suhm and Jelks typology (1962), refined by Perttula (2010, 2011; Perttula and Nelson 2004). Of
the five sherds, three refit and are from a vessel with a medium paste with grog and bone temper.
During the analysis, one of these sherds broke into two pieces. The refitted sherds have
smoothed interior and exterior surface treatment and were identified as a utility ware. The sherds
and were originally identified as having possible incising, however, closer inspection reveals that
the line could have been caused by the breakage the sherd has incurred. Based on thickness,
temper, and paste of the sherds, they likely date to the Middle Caddo period. A fourth sherd is
from the same provenience and appears to have been from the same vessel although it did not

refit. The fifth sherd has a fine paste with grog temper. The exterior is red slipped and most
closely resembles Sanders Slipped (Perttula et al. 2016:87). Based on these points of comparison
and taking into account regional variation, the ceramic assemblage likely dates from to the
Early/Middle Caddo periods.
While the artifacts and any features that may have been present in the upper 30 cm of the site
deposit are likely to have been destroyed by plowing, intact features could be preserved below
the plow zone in the underlying clay subsoil. Artifacts recovered from the site suggest it was
occupied during the Early to Middle Caddo periods. Given the wood charcoal preservation, and
the potential for residential features such as houses, burial pits, middens, and storage pits, it is
recommended that additional testing is necessary to determine if site 41FN244 is eligible under
Criterion D for the NRHP or as an SAL. The historic component of the site, likely dates to the
early or mid-20th century, and no further work for this component is recommended.
41FN245
This small historic site is located in the west central portion of the study area, just south of the
drainage that bisects the property. The site is located near the junction of three fence lines. The
ground surface is level and the site measures approximately 100 m north/south by 85 m east/west
and covers 6,490 sq. meters ([0.48 acres] Figure 22). A two-track road provides access through
the site area to the southern pasture. As such, ground visibility was between 50 and 70 percent
for a large portion of the site area. Despite the exposure, no artifacts were noted on the surface or
protruding from the soil. Likewise, no evidence of residential or storage structures in the form of
rocks, bricks, boards, or sheet metal was present.
Five of the 13 STs excavated in the area were positive for historic artifacts. The majority (n=15)
came from 10-20 cmbs and all artifacts were found in the top 30 cmbs (Table 9). There were
nine European ceramics, 10 pieces of glass, and nine pieces of metal. The ceramics were all
unidentifiable whiteware. Two sherds had exterior decoration. One had a blue glaze and the other
was too degraded to ascertain. Both were too small to identify. The nine container glass shards
included amber, to aqua, clear, milk, and opaque colors. All are consistent with late-19th to mid20th century production. The one piece of window glass recovered, measured 2.63 mm thick and
probably post-dates 1920 (Moir 1988). Seven unidentifiable nail fragments, a fence staple, and
one other unidentifiable fragment make up the metal assemblage. No structures were ever shown
in this location on historic maps or aerials and the location was likely a dumping area near the
edge of the property adjacent to a road. Overall, the historic assemblage dates from the late-19th
to mid-20th century. Due to the relatively low-artifact density, absence of any structural remains
or features, and the lack of deposit integrity the site is not recommended as eligible for listing on
the NRHP or as an SAL.

41FN246
Site 41FN246 is a historic trash accumulation that was encountered near the southwest corner of
the Witcher property along the western fence line in conjunction with attempts to relocate site
41FN179. No artifacts or evidence of structural features were found on the surface of the pasture
which is shown in Figure 23. No structures were shown at this location on any of the historic
maps or aerials that were reviewed. The site covers an area of 3,695 sq. meters (0.91 acres) that
is oriented roughly north-south and is 80 m long and 55 m wide.
Nine artifacts were recovered from the upper 20 cm of three of the nine ST excavated (Figure 24
and Table 10). The artifacts included only European ceramics and container glass. The ceramics
consisted of a stoneware sherd and three whiteware sherds. One of the whiteware sherds had a
partial maker’s mark that was identified as the William Brunt Pottery Co. (Figure 25) and likely
dates between 1892 and 1911 (Kovel and Kovel 1986:194C). The five shards of container glass
were clear, amber, and sun-colored-amethyst. Overall, the historic assemblage dates from the
late-19th to mid-20th century. Due to the low artifact density, the absence of any structural
remains or features, and the lack of deposit integrity the site is not recommended as eligible for
listing on the NRHP or as an SAL.

Conclusions
During planning for the intensive pedestrian survey of 30 percent of the proposed LBCR
footprint, Survey Area Q was selected because it crossed a high potential area where the edge of
the second terrace of Bois d’Arc Creek was present. This proposed survey area was to cross
private property owned by Mr. Witcher. At the time, Mr. Witcher denied NTMWD’s request for
survey access and ARC revised the proposed survey areas (Davis et al 2014:99). Since that time,
Mr. Witcher identified four archaeological sites (41FN176, 41FN177, 41FN178, and 41FN179)
on his property (Perttula et al. 2015a). All of this information was provided to NTMWD, who in
turn requested that ARC conduct an intensive pedestrian survey of the Witcher property, since
Mr. Witcher would now grant access. However, the reported location of site 41FN179 by the
original recorders demonstrated that the site could be on property owned by NTMWD (TARL
2015). The site was not relocated during the current field effort. The site appears to be
misplotted. The centroid reported to TARL was extensively tested, but no evidence of the site
was found. The site description does not match the one described in the initial recording report
(Perttula et al. 2015a:10). That report says 300 m south of 41FN177, which would place it on
NTMWD property south of Mr. Witcher’s property. Although, Mr. Witcher pointed out to the
area directly south of his stock pond as the possible site location during the ARC survey. This
area was also shovel tested and no artifacts were recovered. Additional testing on the NTMWD
property south of the Mr. Witcher will be necessary to see if the site lies where it was described
rather than where it was plotted.
The sites recorded within the Witcher Property study area represent prehistoric and historic sites
similar to those recorded on adjacent properties during the original LBCR survey (Davis et al.
2014). Additionally, this survey area represents the bulk of the remaining unsurveyed terrace
deposits along Bois d’Arc Creek (Davis et al. 2014:Figure 14). The prehistoric sites previously
recorded on the Witcher property were contemporaneous and consistent with sites in the area
dating between the Late Archaic and the Middle Caddo periods.
Paleoindian dart points have been documented in a wide variety of private personal collections in
Fannin County that are discussed by the following researchers (Green 2014:295-302; Bolin
1993; Jennings 2005; Perttula et al. 2015a:9). However, none have been documented in situ in
the LBCR project area and they were typically found deflated in the Bois d’Arc Creek channel or
on the surface of plowed fields. Site 41FN177 is described by Perttula et al. (2015a:9) as having

a Dalton dart point in the private JL Collection. During the survey, no evidence of the
Paleoindian period was found. Additional testing at 41FN177 is necessary to finalize an NRHP
and SAL recommendation.
Sites 41FN176, 41FN178, and 41FN179 were all described as dating between the Late Archaic
and Middle Caddo periods (Perttula et al. 2015a). ARC attempted to relocate site 41FN179 but it
was not found. Only site 41FN178 revealed sufficient evidence of these time periods during
ARC’s revisit. This site is comparable in location and setting to 41FN110, 41FN118, 41FN120,
41FN122, and 41FN151, upstream on Bois d’Arc Creek (Davis et al. 2014). A similar
assemblage was recovered at site 41FN244 during this study. All these sites are situated along
the leading edges of the terrace deposits overlooking the creek’s floodplain. Additionally, sites
41FN178 and 41FN244 may have sufficient preservation that radiocarbon dates and
environmental reconstruction are possible and could help to better understand these time periods
in the Bois d’Arc Creek and Red River watersheds. Recent survey work at Riverby Ranch
demonstrated that features could be present and preserved at the base of the plow zone similar to
the features found at sites 41FN41 and 41FN235 (Davis et al. 2015:386). ARC documented
prehistoric ceramics and diagnostic arrow points from sites 41FN178 and 41FN244 that are
consistent with other Early to Middle Caddo assemblages in the area. Sites 41FN176, 41FN178,
and 41FN244 warrant additional testing to determine if they are eligible under Criterion D for
the NRHP or as an SAL.
Additionally, three sites (41FN244, 41FN245, and 41FN246) contained historic artifacts. The
assemblages from these sites suggest late-19th to mid-20th century occupation. However, no
structures were documented in these areas or found on the ground surface. Historic research and
oral histories collected during the LBCR study (Davis et al. 2014:380-381) demonstrated that
most of the late-19th century occupation was removed during the mid-20th century to maximize
agricultural activities. The historic components have no features and contain generic massproduced artifacts found commonly in numerous historic sites along Bois d’Arc Creek. Sites
41FN245 and 41FN246, as well as the historic component of 41FN244 do not present contexts
that are worthy of further investigation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No additional testing is recommended at sites 41FN245, and 41FN246. These sites have lowdensity deposits in the plow zone with no evidence of organic preservation. They are similar to
others recorded along Bois d’Arc Creek and are not eligible under Criterion A, B, C, or D of the
NRHP or as SALs. Further testing and investigation is needed at the following sites in order to
determine their full vertical and horizontal extents as well as to assist in making NRHP
determinations: 41FN176, 41FN177, 41FN178, and 41FN244. These sites are similar to other
sites in the LBCR study area and represent the remains of Late Archaic through Early/Middle
Caddo period Native American occupations. Additionally, the third possible location for the site
41FN179 should be investigated, 300 m south of 41FN177 on NTMWD property. These
investigations should be conducted under a new antiquities permit and coordinated with the
USACE, Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, and the THC in accordance with the project’s PA and
Research Design (Skinner et al. 2010).
