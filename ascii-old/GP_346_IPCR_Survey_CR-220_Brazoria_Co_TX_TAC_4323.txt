ABSTRACT

On behalf of Jacobs Carter Burgess, Inc., HRA Gray & Pape, LLC conducted an
archaeological assessment on property associated with proposed Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) road widening Project CSJ Number 0912-31-195 in Brazoria
County, Texas. The road widening project is being conducted by TxDOT’s Houston District.
Texas Antiquities Permit number 4323 was issued for this project. The Lead Agency for this
project is TxDOT.
The purpose of this archaeological investigation was conducted in order to determine
if the initiation of this project would affect any previously identified historic properties as
defined by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended (36 CFR 800), and to assess the potential for previously unidentified cultural
resources to be located within the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). All fieldwork
and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (Antiquities Code of Texas)
and federal (National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended [36CFR 800])
guidelines, and according to standards set forth by the TxDOT Programmatic Agreement for
Enhancement Projects.
Background research indicates there are no previously recorded archaeological
resources within two miles of the project, and fieldwork consisting of a pedestrian survey
found the entire APE greatly disturbed by previous construction. Archaeological fieldwork
on the project started with a pedestrian survey of the entire APE. Areas in the APE
determined to be potentially undisturbed during walkover were subjected to subsurface
testing.
Given the extent of disturbances caused by construction in the APE and the lack of
cultural resources near the APE that might be impacted by the project, HRA Gray & Pape
recommend that no further work be required and that TxDOT Project CSJ Number 0912-31195 be cleared to proceed as planned.

CHAPTER I. MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On behalf of Jacobs Carter Burgess, Inc., HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray &
Pape) conducted an archaeological assessment on property associated with proposed Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) road widening Project CSJ Number 0912-31-195 in
Brazoria County, Texas. The road widening project is being conducted by TxDOT’s
Houston District. Texas Antiquities Permit number 4323 was issued for this project. The
Lead Agency for this project is TxDOT.
The purpose of this archaeological investigation was conducted in order to determine
if the initiation of this project would affect any previously identified historic properties as
defined by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended (36 CFR 800), and to assess the potential for previously unidentified cultural
resources to be located within the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). All fieldwork
and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (Antiquities Code of Texas)
and federal (National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended [36CFR 800])
guidelines, and according to standards set forth by the TxDOT Programmatic Agreement for
Enhancement Projects.
The APE includes a linear corridor approximately 6.4 kilometers (four miles) in
length and ranging from 46 to 61 meters (150 to 200 feet) in width. Also included as part of
this project area, a series of retention ponds located adjacent to the proposed highway
corridor that are expected to be approximately 0.92-meter (three feet) deep to allow for
excavation and the maximum depth of cultural resources in the project footprint.
Background research indicates there are no previously recorded archaeological
resources within two miles of the project, and fieldwork consisting of a pedestrian survey
found the entire APE greatly disturbed by previous construction. Archaeological fieldwork
on the project started with a pedestrian survey of the entire APE. Areas in the APE
determined to be potentially undisturbed during walkover were subjected to subsurface
testing. Typically this begins with the use of 2.54-centimeter (one-inch) Oakfield soil probes
to detect areas of disturbed soil. If shovel testing appears necessary in an undisturbed area,
shovel tests are excavated within the APE to a maximum depth of one meter (three feet), or
until culturally sterile subsoil is reached.
Given the extent of disturbances caused by construction in the APE and the lack of
any cultural resources near the APE that might be impacted by the project, HRA Gray &
Pape recommend that no further work be required and that TxDOT Project CSJ Number
0912-31-195 be cleared to proceed as planned.
HRA Gray & Pape project personnel included Principal Investigator and report co­
author James G. Foradas, Ph.D., Crew Chief Robert Rome, Field Technician Glen Wagner,
report co-author Rebecca F. Sick, MA, Project Manager James S. Hughey, Graphic
Specialists Tony Scott and Julia Balakirova, and Office Manager Melinda Mendoza- Scott.

Fieldwork was conducted on December 5, 2006 and December 15, 2006. This survey
required approximately 24 person hours to complete.

REPORT ORGANIZATION
This document is organized into six numbered chapters and two lettered appendices.
Chapter I, is an introductory chapter describing the project and report organization. Chapter
II summarizes research design with respect to background research and field methods.
Chapter III summarizes the environmental setting of project area. Chapter IV summarizes
recent cultural resources management investigations in the vicinity of the project in light of
the broader cultural context of the project area in the region. Chapter V presents the results
of archaeological fieldwork, and Chapter VI provides conclusions and recommendations for
the project. Project plans are provided in Appendix A. A copy of the Potential
Archaeological Liability Map (PALM) supplied by TxDOT is provided in Appendix B.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project area is located along County Road (CR) 220 beginning approximately
one mile west of State Highway 288; the eastern terminus of the project area is located just
west of Farm-to-Market Road 523. The project area is located on the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) 1974 Angleton and 1963 Lake Jackson, Texas 7.5 Minute
quadrangle maps. The project involves an estimated 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) of road
expansion along a section CR 220 in Brazoria County, Texas. Within much of the project
area, CR 220 is proposed for widening between approximately 45 and 60 meters (150 and
200 feet). In the vicinity of Old Angleton Road and the Union Pacific Railroad, the right-ofway (ROW) is proposed for widening on the north side of CR 220 to approximately 110
meters (350 feet) for bridge construction (Appendix A).
The nearest water source to the project is Bastrop Bayou, which is located to the
southeast of the project APE (see Figure 1). The project area is primarily made up of short
pasture grasses with greater than 30 percent ground visibility encompassing approximately
80-90 percent of the project area. Topography associated with the project is featureless and
level. Project plans provided to HRA Gray & Pape at the time of permit application
(Appendix A) indicated that the APE includes a linear corridor approximately 6.4 kilometers
(4 miles) in length and ranging from 46 to 61 meters (150 to 200 feet) in width (Figure 1).
In the vicinity of Old Angleton Road and the Union Pacific Railroad, the ROW is proposed
for widening on the north side of CR 220 to approximately 350 feet (110 meters) for bridge
construction. Also included as part of this project area a series of retention ponds located
adjacent to the proposed highway corridor (see Appendix A).
The expansion will begin approximately one mile to the west of State Highway 288
and terminate at Farm-to-Market Road 523. In all, a total approximately 69 hectares (165
acres) of land will be encompassed by the proposed project area.

3

Existing project plans indicate the 4-layer pavement will be a total of approximately
55.9 centimeters (22 inches), and that roadside drainage ditches will be approximately 60.1
centimeters (24 inches) deep at their centerline. Retention ponds, and other localized
construction associated with the project (see Appendix A) may be deeper; however they will
be dug in Houston PALM Unit 4 areas (see Abbott 2001 and Appendix B) which do not
require deep testing. Therefore, the APE depth in the project is expected to be approximately
0.92 meters (3 feet) to allow for excavation and the maximum depth of cultural resources in
the project footprint. It was the understanding of HRA Gray & Pape that at the time the
fieldwork commenced, all existing ROW was controlled by TxDOT. Figure 2 provides an
overview of the investigations conducted within the project area.

ACKOWLEDGEMENTS
Site file research was conducted by James G. Foradas, Ph.D. prior to the field visit
and included reviewing records maintained by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin, Texas, as well as consultation of on-line research archives maintained by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Dr. Foradas and Crew Chief Robert Rome
conducted the field visit on December 5, 2006. Dr. Foradas and Glen Wagner conducted the
field visit on December 15, 2006. This survey required approximately 24 person hours to
complete. Activities conducted during the field visit included visual inspection of the project
area and the preparation of field maps. Photographs were also taken of the project area. Dr.
Foradas and Rebecca F. Sick, MA, RPA prepared this short report. James S. Hughey was the
Project Manager, and edited the report. Graphics for this report were prepared by Tony Scott
and Julia Balakirova. Melinda Mendoza-Scott produced the report.

CHAPTER II. RESEARCH DESIGN

SITE FILE AND LITERATURE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was conducted by consulting on-line research archives maintained
by the THC. Research objectives were to identify all recorded archaeological sites within 1.6
kilometers (one mile) of a project area and all recorded historic structures located
immediately adjacent to the project’s APE. Literature searches also produced geoscience
data concerning the environmental setting of the project area, such as soil maps and geologic
maps.

FIELD METHODS
Archaeological fieldwork on the project started with a pedestrian survey of the entire
APE. During the walkover, the project area was photographed and notes were made on
copies of project plan maps and other field maps. The project area was subdivided into three
survey segments to facilitate photo documentation and field mapping: 1) residential and
commercial lots from State Highway 288 to the railroad tracks; 2) residential and commercial
lots from the railroad tracks to a fence line at the east end of a swim and tennis club on CR
220; and 3) a rural segment composed of former rice fields extending from the fenceline of
the swim and tennis club to the project terminus at Farm-to-Market 523.
Areas in the APE determined to be potentially undisturbed during walkover were
subjected to subsurface testing. Typically this begins with the use of 2.54-centimeter (one­
inch) Oakfield soil probes to detect areas of disturbed soil. If shovel testing appears
necessary in an undisturbed area, shovel tests are excavated within the APE to a maximum
depth of one meter (three feet), or until culturally sterile subsoil is reached. All soil
recovered is screened through ¼ inch wire mesh, except clay soils which are hand sorted. No
cultural resources were detected in the APE; therefore, site delineation, laboratory analysis,
and curation methods are not discussed in this report.

CHAPTER III. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

A review of the TxDOT Houston Area PALM (Abbott 2001), National Web Soil
survey data (National Cooperative Soil Survey [NCSS] 2007), applicable USGS and State of
Texas Bureau of Economic Geology geologic maps, topographic maps and aerial imagery
(USGS 1984, 1995; Van Siclen 1991), and materials provided by TxDOT (see Appendix A)
was conducted to predict factors that might affect site visibility and integrity during the
survey of the APE.

TXDOT PALM
TxDOT’s PALM (Abbott 2001) covers Brazoria County and other counties in the
greater Houston area. These maps are based on a combination of data, including soil
associates, landform types, cultural and natural resource distribution, and historic and modern
land use data. The PALM is a cultural resource management tool that predicts the likelihood
of detecting intact prehistoric cultural resources in various topographic settings around
Houston. The model also recommends the type of archaeological survey stratify that should
be implemented for a given PALM unit.
For PALM Unit 1, surface survey is recommended, and deep inspection is
recommended if deep impacts are anticipated. For PALM Unit 2, only surface survey is
recommended. For PALM Unit 3a, no surface survey is recommended and deep
reconnaissance is recommended only if severe impacts are anticipated. For PALM Unit 4, no
survey is recommended.

PROJECT AREA GEOMORPHOLOGY AND SOILS
The majority of the APE is located in PALM Unit 4; no survey is recommended in
these areas. However, these PALM unit boundaries will be verified in the field. A small
portion of the project area (less than 0.8 kilometer [0.5 mile]) is located within PALM Unit 2;
surface survey recommended.
Topography associated with the project area is featureless and level. Soils in the
project area are primarily made up of the soil map unit known as Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1
percent slopes and Bernard clay loam. These soils are associated with the Beaumont
Formation and are characterized as somewhat poorly drained and have slow to very slow
permeability. These soils have a high shrink-swell potential mainly due to the considerable
and lasting wetness. These soils generally have a low potential to produce intact deeply
buried resources.

7

The portion of Brazoria County within which the project area is underlain by
Pleistocene-age deposits of the Beaumont Formation. These deposits are made up of clay,
silt and sand. This includes stream channel, point bar, natural levee, back swamp and mud
flat deposits (Barnes 1982).
According to the latest National Cooperative Soil Survey (2007) information, soils
mapped within the APE consist of Aris fine sandy loam, Bacliff clay, Bernard clay loam,
Bernard-Edna complex, Edna find sandy loam, and Lake Charles Clay. Aris find sandy loam
is a nearly level, nonsaline soil that is somewhat poorly drained. Bernard clay is also a
nonsaline soil that is nearly level; this soil is also somewhat poorly drained. Soils of the
Bernard-Edna complex are somewhat poorly drained to poorly drained. Soils within this
complex are also nearly level and nonsaline. Edna fine sandy loam is a gently sloping
nonsaline soil that is poorly drained. Finally, Lake Charles clay is a gently sloping soil that
is somewhat poorly drained.
According to Abbott (2001: table 2) these soils all typically have a low
geoarchaeological potential “or likelihood that the soil could contain buried cultural material
in reasonable context” (Abbott 2001:20). The majority of the APE is located in PALM Unit
4 (Abbott 2001: figure 66, see Appendix A). No survey is recommended in these areas.
However, a portion of the project area (approximately 0.5 miles) is located in PALM unit 2;
surface survey recommended.
Examination of recent aerial photographs (NCSS 2007; USGS 1995) of the project
area indicated that all of the property within the existing project ROW has been disturbed by
largely urban processes as well as natural erosion. Disturbances visible in the aerial
photographs included cement and blacktop driveways and parking areas, drainage ditches on
both sides of the street, and construction of buildings.
Vegetation in the APE consists largely of manicured lawn grasses along the berms of
CR 220 with the occasional ornamental deciduous or coniferous tree (see NCSS 2007).

8

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS

A preliminary search of the THC Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online
indicated that no cultural resources are located in or immediately adjacent to the project APE.
However, a review of the Handbook of Texas History online indicates that historic events
and historic individuals may be associated with the project area.
Similarly, the prehistoric context of the area is best understood by starting with Aten
(1983) and Patterson (1996) treatises on the prehistory of southeast Texas. Prior to
colonization of the region, it was occupied by Karankawa Indians. Dr. Robert Ricklis points
out that there were actually five different subgroups of Kawakawa Indians with the northern
most tribe, called the Cocos, living in the area of modern day Brazoria County (Ricklis
1996). Archaeological evidence has encountered numerous sites in the area consisting of
shell middens and campsite refuse of the people.
Historians agree that in 1528, Alvar Nuñez, Cabez de Vaca landed on San Luis Island
and crossed the Brazos River in order to look for provisions in the area that would become
Brazoria County. Many other Spanish explorers passed through the area like Alonso De
Leon in 1689 looking for the lost La Salle expedition and in 1727 Joaquin de Orobi y
Basterra came through looking for French intruders in the Trinity River area. In the 18th
century Spain started to occupy Texas in an effort to stop French and English incursions and
would often enter the area of Brazoria County to trade with the local Indians and search for
their lost horses (Kleiner 2000).
The county first became populated when it became the proposed settlement for
Stephen F. Austin and eighty-nine of Austin’s Old Three Hundred in 1824. Some of the
earliest communities consisted of Velasco, Brazoria, and Columbia. Soon after 1835 the first
inauguration of mail routes crossed the area and with this was also the first provisional
council headed by Henry Smith the first provisional governor. It was in Velasco soon after
the Battle of San Jacinto that General Santa Anna signed the Treaties of Velasco with the
Republic of Texas on May 14, 1836. Under this newly formed provisional government came
the formation of the first counties in Texas, among them Brazoria County, taking its name
from the Brazos River (Kleiner 2000).
It was during this time between 1849 and 1859 that the county of Brazoria flourished.
The county became the wealthiest in Texas due in part to its largely Southern society based
on plantation life and slavery. Agriculture was the foundation for the county’s economy
based primarily on sugar on cotton (Kleiner 2000).
Prior to the Civil War, 99 percent of the residents voted for secession paving the way
for new industries to be organized to help the Confederate Army, such as the Dance Brothers
gun works manufacturing shop. It was during this time that agriculture production declined

9

due in part to the presence of federal troops and destruction of several plantations. After the
Civil War the road to recovery was very slow with the principal crops now becoming corn,
grains, sweet and Irish potatoes, fruits, wild grapes and cotton and sugar for export. Along
with agriculture, cattle became a major player for many area residents. With the northern
markets shut off in the 1860s, many hide and tallow factories were established along the
banks of the Brazos River (Kleiner 2000).
Up until the time of the Great Depression, most residents made their living from
agriculture with a maximum number of farms in 1940 reaching 3065. A major boom for the
economy came from the greater production of rice. By 1940 the total acreage for rice had
risen from 6000 acres to approximately 16,000 acres and became the nation’s number one
rice producing area (Kleiner 2000).
Brazoria County established its first school in 1827, followed by the Brazoria
Academy in 1839. Academia became an integral part of the county around 1900 with the
introduction of eight independent school districts employing 200 teachers to educate the
county’s 6000 students. The results of the county’s educational efforts can be seen in the
statistics of 1950 where only 23 percent of the population had completed high school, but in
1982 more than 65 percent had graduated from high school (Kleiner 2000).
Now Brazoria County offers an assortment of recreational activities. Everything from
fishing, hunting, boating, skiing, and an array of other water sports are offered. In
conjunction they also offer access to historic sites such as the Varner-Hogg Plantation State
Historical Park.
There are no archaeological sites located within a 1-kilometer (0.62-mile) radius of
the APE. The nearest recorded archaeological site (41BO196) is over 6 kilometers (3.7
miles) south of the APE. Site 41BO196, the Brazos Canal, is characterized as an engineering
structure, dated to the mid 1800s, during Texas’ early statehood. This site is located in the
city of Lake Jackson, south of the project area. Given the environmental and cultural setting
of the project area in relation to previously recorded resources in the region, the potential to
find intact archaeological resources that may be eligible for listing on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) is low to moderate.
Given the environmental and cultural setting of the project area and the paucity of
sites recorded in the Atlas in this part of Waller County (see Abbott 2001; Aten 1983), the
potential to find intact archaeological resources that may be eligible for listing on the NRHP
is low. In addition, resources are likely to be found at shallow depths within the APE and
much of this upland region.

10

CHAPTER V. RESULTS OF THE CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY

SEGMENT A: STATE HIGHWAY 288 TO RAILROAD TRACKS
Survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact that construction
processes might have on cultural resources located within the APE. The project area was
found to be entirely disturbed by previous construction, matching observations in recent
aerial photographs and predictions made in the Houston Area PALM.
Disturbances (Plates 1 and 2) include construction of the highway railroad tracks,
including drainage ditches on both sides of the highway. It should also be noted that the
majority of this area had been used for rice plantations. As such, small “rice levees” were
visible on the ground surface. While some of this land was in use for agriculture, some areas
were used as pastureland. Other disturbances to the area include the construction of modern
metal buildings and houses.
A total of six shovel tests were excavated within two PALM Unit 2 subsegments of
this area (see Figure 2, Plates 3 and 4); none were positive for cultural resources. A typical
shovel test was excavated to a depth of 40 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) (15.74
inches below the surface [inbs]) and contained one stratum in profile. Stratum I consisted of
a layer of black (10YR 4/1) clay.

SEGMENT B: RAILROAD TRACKS TO A FENCELINE
Similar to Segment A, Segment B also contained several types of disturbance. These
included but were not limited to highway construction, railroad construction, “rice levees”,
and building construction (Plates 3 and 4). Pedestrian survey confirmed the area was
mapped in PALM Unit 4 and no shovel tests were placed in the segment.
One structure that was greater than 50 years in age was encountered. This structure
was a wood framed house with an L-shaped plan (see Figure 2). This house has two stories
and a front gabled roof. The roof was covered in asphalt shingles. The outer walls of the
house were covered in flush horizontal boards. The foundation of this house was not visible.
The house has several different types of windows; these include single hung and fixed
windows. The house also has a porch over the entry. Based on these characteristics, it is
likely that this house dates to the late 19th to early 20th century. While this house is within
the viewshed of the APE, it is not located on land that will be encompassed within the project
area. It is unlikely that the widening of this road will have any permanent impacts to this
property. If there are any impacts to this house, they are expected to be minimal and
temporary.

SEGMENT C: FENCELINE TO FARM-TO-MARKET ROAD 523
Similar to Segments A and B, Segment C also contained several types of disturbance.
These include but were not limited to highway construction, railroad construction, “rice
levees”, and building construction (see Plate 4). The remains of rice levees observed on
aerial photographs (USGS 1995) were still evident on the ground in this segment, which lies
entirely in PALM Unit 4. Several natural drainages and a deep detention basin seen in USGS
(1984, 1995) maps and aerial photographs were also visible on the ground in the project
ROW. Shallow near surface disturbances associated with a series of recently constructed
residences bordering the project ROW were also observed in a former rice field at the
easternmost portion of the project (see Figure 2).

CHAPTER VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The results of the site file review indicate that no previously identified cultural
resources are located near the proposed project area (see Figure 1). Field investigations
indicate that the proposed project will impact areas of existing ROW that have been greatly
disturbed by previous activities involving road, building and drainage ditch construction,
placement of underground and overhead utility lines; and the construction of “rice levees” to
facilitate agriculture.
The results of the site file review and the evidence of severe disturbance within the
APE, indicate that no archaeological resources will be affected by the proposed project as
currently planned. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological survey
work be required, and that the project be permitted to proceed.
