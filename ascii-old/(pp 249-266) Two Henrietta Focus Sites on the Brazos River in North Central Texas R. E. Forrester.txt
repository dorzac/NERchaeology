Two Henrietta Focus Sites
on the Brazos River in
North Central Texas
R. E. Forrester

ABSTRACT
Two small excavated sites on opposite sides of the Clear Fork of the Brazos
River in North Central Texas were occupied by Late Prehistoric Henrietta
Focus people. The southern site had side-notched triangular projectile points
and their Fresno preforms. The northern site also yielded bulbar-stemmed
arrowpoints and their preforms, variants of the Cliffton "point." A small associated cemetery with poorly preserved flexed burials is also described.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this paper is not to address some abstruse Texas archeological problem and resolve it. Rather, it is to record activities performed, and
specimens gathered, by my father and myself many years ago, prior to the recognition of the need to record and retain appropriate data recovered in excavations. At that time, we were merely artifact collectors, with no understanding of
the need to keep records other than information on the county of origin of the
artifacts. Nothing vicious was intended by our actions; we were only working
with a lack of knowledge. Indeed, in those days, some professional Texas archeologists were performing little better than ourselves.
Now, more than half a century later, I present the archeological data recovered from two small excavated sites on opposite sides of the Clear Fork of
the Brazos River. The information is presented in an informal manner, as that
was the manner in which it was gathered.

Historical Background
In 1939, J.S. and J.W. Patterson, both of Moran in Shackelford County,
Texas, were hired to remove the spines on prickly pear cacti by burning. This
was an operation whereby a man carried a container of kerosene on his back with
a rubber hose leading to an iron pipe. This pipe, about five feet long, had a handle
with a trigger at the near end to control a blowtorch at the far end. The volume of
flame was controlled by the trigger, and played over the prickly pear. The spines
and glochids were burned away, leaving harmless pads.

During periods of drought at that time and place, the cacti were utilized
as food for cattle. Their spines would be burned off over large areas, and the
cattle could and would eat the nutritious pads. A second purpose was also
served: that of destroying the pestiferous cacti. Unfortunately, if the cattle later
found an area of unburned cacti, they would eat them too, having developed
a taste for the pads, but not having been bred for intelligence. The spines would
then become stuck in the nose, lips, tongue, mouth, throat, and stomachs of
the cattle, causing serious damage.
These two "pear burners" were burning off spines on some pasturage then
belonging to Mrs. George W. Elliot of Moran. The property lay on the south
side of the Clear Fork of the Brazos River, north of Breckenridge, Texas. This
was in extreme northern Stephens County, seven km northwest of Crystal Falls.
During the course of their operations, they found arrowpoints on an exposed
small, thin, sandy midden on the first terrace about 75 m from the south bank
of the Brazos River. This was in the northwest corner of Mrs. Elliot’s pasture, in the side of an old abandoned oil well slush pit. Creation of the slush
pit had destroyed a large part of the midden.
The site was reported to their kinsman, Claude Patterson, also of Moran,
and to his friend, R. E. Forrester, M.D., the writer’s father. During the summer of 1939, and at odd times later, most of the remaining midden was excavated and screened through a 1/4-inch screen, using the first mechanically
powered screen made by the Forresters. It was driven by the gasoline motor
from Mrs. Claude Patterson’s Maytag washing machine, and had to be returned
to her after each use so she could do her laundry. The speed reduction pulley
was a 21 inch wire spoke Model A Ford automobile wheel, minus the tire.
The weight of this monstrous assembly must have approached 300 pounds, as
it required a separate trailer to transport it, and at least three people to move
it about. It was tremendously rugged, and could not be bogged down by two
shovelers.
This site was given the catalog designation of F-O (later TARL designation 41SE19). Almost directly north of 41SE19, on the opposite side of the
river on the first terrace, was found a similar site eroding directly into the river.
This was designated Site F-R (41SE18) (Figure 1). This site was minimally
excavated during the pre-World War II years, but was surface collected. Some
additional excavations were performed by the author alone in 1964 and 1965.
During these excavations, cultural materials were retained if evidence of
modification was noted on any chert, shell, or bone, but debitage or bone scraps
were not collected; drum fish otoliths were kept.
This was not the case with the artifacts obtained in 1939 from 41SE18
and 41SE19. Then, if a specimen was whole enough for display, it was catalogued. This involved placing a unique identifying number on the artifact, and
a corresponding number in a catalog, thus permanently, recording the object’s

provenience. If not satisfactory for display, it was still retained but not identified
or kept separate from other unrelated uncataloged materials.
ARTIFACTS FROM 41SE19
Only side-notched triangular points and triangular Fresno points (Bell 1958,
1960) were found at 41SE19. The Fresno points are considered to be preforms
for the various side-notched triangular points (Figures 2 and 3).
A list of Henrietta Focus trait cultural materials (Krieger 1946; Poteet 1938;
Suhm et al. 1954) found at 41SE19 is provided in Table 1, along with a list of
expected Henrietta Focus traits that were not represented at the site. This combination of traits at 41SE19 indicates a brief Henrietta Focus occupation on the
south bank of the river, although the full complement of artifactual traits was not
found.

Burials
In 1965 and 1966, three burials were excavated approximately 75 m east of
41SE19. These are catalogued as site ARX (no TARL trinomial designation has
been obtained). Appendix 1 contains osteological data on these burials.
This cemetery was probably associated with one of the nearby midden sites.
At least three more burials were located but were not excavated. The first of the

three burials produced a side-notched triangular Washita arrowpoint (see Figure
2). Whether it represented a burial offering, or was in the body at the time of
death, is unknown. Damage from burrowing animals was severe in all three
burials.

41SE18
A distinct arrowpoint type was found at 41SE18 that differed from any
known to have come from 41SE19. This type has a stem which is bulbar or
diamond-shaped, and has long, often out-flaring, barbs (Figure 4). It resembles
the Hayes (Bell 1958, 1960) arrowpoint, although the latter is generally larger,
and also usually shows a cut-in near the tip. For purposes of this discussion only,
I will call this arrowpoint form "Lusk," in reference to a cross-road name a few
miles west. At this point, I am not prepared to offer a new formal name, due to
lack of sufficient numbers and little distributional data. Table 2 provides dimensional data on "Lusk" points.

Cliffton "arrowpoints" were found at 41SE18. By overlaying "Lusk" and
Cliffton points, it seems reasonable to suggest that the Cliffton was clearly the
preform for the "Lusk" point (Figure 5). This Cliffton variant is designated as
Cliffton II herein, to separate it from the Cliffton used as a Perdiz preform
(referred to as Cliffton I). Both Clifftons I and II have appeared in the literature
under the Cliffton name (Turner and Hester 1993:208).
To assess the validity of separating the Cliffton preforms into Types I and
II, I examined all the Clifftons recovered from Horn Shelter No. 2, which
produced Perdiz points but no side-notched triangular, Fresno, or "Lusk"
arrowpoints (Forrester n.d.), and compared them with the Clifftons from 41SE 18.
On inspecting the two Cliffton types, it is quite apparent that they differ: Cliffton
I types are deeply concave on each side of what became the stem, and are rougher
and more unfinished. On the other hand, Cliffton II specimens appear more
finished, with fine retouching present. They are trapezoidal, with two basal edges
commonly not indented, and range from 22-52 mm in length, 15-29 mm in
width, and 3-6 mm in thickness. The impression is that only diagonal basal
notches are needed to complete the "Lusk" points.
The visual differences between the two Cliffton types are so pronounced
that in a blind test I was able to match the Cliffton I and II points with their
proper areas in an excavated multicomponent site on a tributary of the Brazos
River, a few miles upstream from Granbury, Hood County, Texas. The two site
areas slightly overlap: one area bore a full Henrietta Focus set of attributes,

256

including the "Lusk" points; the other had none of these characteristics, but had
Perdiz points. Thirty-one of the 32 Cliffton preforms were accurately assigned to
areas with either Perdiz or side-notched triangular and "Lusk" points (Prentice
Brown, personal communication, 1967).
I have found other "Lusk" points only on 41SE17, a large surface site in the
southwestern part of Stephens County. Of 181 complete or near complete
arrowpoints from that site, two were Type II Clifftons (No Type I Clifftons were
present; and only one Perdiz) and two were "Lusk" arrowpoints. These were
grouped with the Alba type in the site report (Forrester 1991). Side-notched
triangular points were present in considerable numbers (33 specimens, plus 28
Fresno preforms). The dominant arrowpoint type there was the Scallorn (N=67,
with 33 Granbury preforms).

Site Condition and Evaluation
The river is presently eroding 41SE18; the erosional destruction is a series
of gullies, rather than vertical faces caving off into the river. This made the site
difficult to excavate, and most of the excavation was done in the flat area behind
the gullies. Some artifacts were gathered from the gully slopes after they had
washed free from above; these were recorded as having been excavated.
The degree of destruction of the site by natural causes is difficult to assess;
how far the fiver has proceeded to the north since the last occupation, and how
far the site was originally located from the river edge, has not been determined.
At last examination (1966), the occupation area appeared to be no more than 6-8
cm thick, with almost that much sterile soil on top. No attempt was made to test
outlying areas to define the extent of the site. An area of roughly 3 x 3 m was
excavated and screened through a 1/4-inch sieve. Little or no occupational debris
is apparent in cross sections revealed by erosion of the river bank only a few
meters in either direction from the excavated or eroded living area. No pits were
detected. Occasional burned pieces of sandstone were encountered, hut none
appeared to form fireplaces or hearths.
41SE18 appears to have had multiple occupations based on the broad
variety of arrowpoints found at the site (Figure 6). Few characteristic Henrietta
Focus traits were recognized in the 41SE18 material culture assemblage as
compared with 41SE 19. No pipe or pipe fragments were found, nor any hematite
celts or curved knives. Whether the Type II Clifftons and the "Lusk" points were
left at the site by Henrietta Focus people, or by an unrelated group, is presently
undetermined.

Flint Sources
To the author’s knowledge, there are no outcroppings of siliceous stone
satisfactory for knapping and tool manufacture within 60 km of these two sites.

Figure 6. Arrowpoints from 41SE18: top row, unclassified arrowpoints; bottom row, sidenotched triangular points.

All the stone artifacts found in these sites were examined in an attempt to
determine the origin of the lithic material. The hematite celt from 41SE19 was
probably made in the local area; that is, in the southwest part of Stephens County.
Abundant hematite cobbles outcrop in that area and a large surface site on Big
Sandy Creek has been identifed as a celt manufacturing center (Forrester 1991).
Of 253 retained siliceous stone items from both sites (and the unprovenienced
group), practically all, or possibly all, are from river gravels. The varieties are
several, but in general they are foreign to the area and of a certain distinctive
kind: commonly light tan or greyish-tan chert, occasionally of a very high quality
bluish-grey flint.
Four possible exceptions to the river gravel chert group include: (a) the tip
of a large blade (41SE18) of waxy brown chert, probably from the Edwards
Plateau area; (b) another large blade (41SE18) of dark multi-colored chert,
possibly from the Alibates quarries in the Texas Panhandle; (c) a Washita point
(41SE19) made of brownish-black chert with fine white specks; and (d) another
Washita type (41SE19) of waxy tan chert, veined with lighter tan. The source
area(s) for the Washita arrowpoints is not known.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Available data indicate that 41SE19 on the south side of the river was a
single component midden deposited by a small group of Late Prehistoric
Henrietta Focus people (e.g., Krieger 1946). The only projectile point types
present were three forms of the triangular side-notched arrowpoint and their
Fresno preforms. Other Henrietta Focus material culture traits were also present,
such as elbow pipes and a hematite celt. While not every trait of the Henrietta

258

Focus was found, those present are, as a group, considered diagnostic of that
focus (Table 3).

The cemetery, located about 75 m east of the midden at 41SE19, consisted of at least six burials, three of which were excavated. The one associated item with the burials was a Washita arrowpoint, suggesting that the burial
was also probably made by the Henrietta Focus people residing at the midden
site. All three excavated burials, and the visible portions of the other three
unexcavated ones, were similar in character: they were flexed, shallow, had
no obvious burial offerings, and were lined and covered with sandstone slabs,
some of which were visible on the ground surface.
While questionable due to extreme deterioration of the skeletal elements,
the three burials appear to have been two women in their 20s, and a man in
his mid-30s. The Washita arrowpoint was found in the grave with the younger
woman.
Site 41SE18, on the north bank of the river, was more temporally mixed
than 41SE19 since it had triangular arrowpoints, a few stemmed arrowpoints,
as well as the "Lusk" points. "Lusk" points and their preforms, Cliffton II
points, have been found in at least four other sites, all of which also had sidenotched triangular arrowpoints. One site was on Big Sandy Creek in Stephens
County (41SE17); Big Sandy Creek is a tributary of the Brazos River. The
other three sites (two surface, one rockshelter) were on the Brazos River or
on a tributary near the river. The southernmost site is a rockshelter overlooking the Brazos River in northern Hill County, Texas. "Lusk" and Clifton II
points become increasingly scarce as one progresses further downstream from
Stephens County. I speculate that there is probably some cultural affiliation
between Henrietta Focus peoples and "Lusk" arrowpoints and the Cliffton II
preform; possibly those groups that manufactured the "Lusk" arrowpoints were
a clan within the Henrietta Focus group (or groups).
Pottery was found on both sites in extremely limited amounts. A fragment of what was likely a circular gorget had been made from a potsherd at
41SE18. At 41SE19, a tiny sherd and a formed lump of fired clay were found.
All three items had shell temper, and thus were probably examples of Nocona
Plain (Krieger 1946).
Two elbow pipes of greenish sandstone were recovered, both from 41SE 19
(Figure 7). Two fragments fit together to form part of a bowl of one pipe; the
other pipe was represented by a slightly coarser variety of the stone. It had
been broken and partially dressed down at the break so that it could be used
again, probably with a stem inserted in place of the missing half. The greenish sandstone material is not found in the local vicinity.
Shell was utilized for scrapers and as a "saw" at the north bank site, and
as a gorget in the southern site. Shells of fresh water mussel were fairly common in both sites, and possibly represent one local food resource.
Otoliths from the heads of drum fish were recovered from 41SE 18; some
showed discoloration from fire. These otoliths are most resistant to decomposition, and offer good evidence that the taking of fish was practiced.

In summary, sites 41SE18 and 41SE19 on opposite sides of the Clear Fork
of the Brazos were both Henrietta Focus middens that were probably occupied
for relatively short periods. However, their association with a small cemetery
suggests a longer occupation period than was indicated simply by the sparse
recovered material remains. No evidence of agricultural pursuits was found at
either site or in their artifact assemblage, nor were any permanent houses or bellshaped storage pits observed in the excavations.

APPENDIX 1
This appendix describes the skeletal materials from three burials at site
ARX, aproximately 75 m east of 41SE19. Only Burial 1 had artifacts in association: a side-notched triangular arrowpoint found in the area of the knees.
Osteological Report: Skeletal Material from Burial 1
The skeletal material shows considerable damage due to both natural decay
of joints and spongy bone (probably minor), and attack by rodent activity (major
damage). At the time of excavation (January 1, 1965) only both innominates,
both femurs, the left tibia, and the left fibula were in place; the remaining bones
appear to have been displaced to a greater or lesser degree (Figure 8).
The following is a complete list of the recovered skeletal material:
Innominates -- right and left (both damaged)
Femurs -- right and left (both damaged)
Tibia -- left only (damaged); plus distal articular surface of tibia
Fibulae -- portion of right; nearly complete left
Calcaneus -- fight only (damaged)

Innominates: Right and left both present; sacrum noted absent. The iliac
crests, pubic bones, sciatic tubers, and obturator foramina are missing from each
innominate. No rodent gnawing is visible. Shape of the greater sciatic notches
would indicate female status; general small size of remaining portions also
indicates a female.

262

Texas Archeological Society

Femurs: Both present, neither broken. Each shows rodent gnawing which
becomes progressively worse distally. Each is missing the distal end, from about
the capsular line. The lesser trochanters are both missing, but by decay rather
than by non-fusion. The greater trochanter is present on the right femur only.
Both heads are present and fused (fuses in 19th year according to Shaeffer
[1951]). Platymerism is not evident. Pilastering of linea aspera is present to a
moderate degree. General appearance of the femorae indicates femininity.
Tibia: Left only is present, plus lower articular surface of the right tibia. In
the tibia present, the proximal articular surface is missing. Its lower articular
surface (distal end) is well fused. The separate lower articular surface from the
missing right tibia is neatly separated at the epiphyseal line. (The upper extremity
fuses about the 20th year; the lower at about 18 years.) It was impossible to
establish if any of the missing surfaces are due to decay or to lack of fusion. If
due to lack of fusion, then age would be about 19 years, based on tibiae alone.
Only a minor amount of rodent gnawing is present.
Fibula: Left fibula almost complete; missing estimated 15 mm. Remaining
portion is 313 mm. Missing end is the proximal. At least part of the damage is
due to rodent gnawing. Shaft is badly gnawed by rodents. Mid-section only is
present from right fibula; remainder was destroyed by rodent activity.
CaIcaneus: From right foot. Lateral surface has been destroyed by decay.
No rodent gnawing is visible. Epiphysis is fused.
Ulna: Proximal half of left ulna present; gnawed through by rodents. Olecranon is missing; coronoid process is present.
Humerus: Left humerus only; complete save for missing head, and the
greater and lesser tubercles. Severely gnawed all over by rodents. A large
supratrochlear foramen (septal aperture) exists at distal end.
Radius: Severely damaged distal end of left radius only. Fused epiphysis
(fusion occurs at 18th to 20th year).
Vertebra: One neural arch from a probable cervical or thoracic vertebra;
spinous process missing; arch is detached from body.
Phalange: Distal half of a phalange from either a hand or a foot.
Temporal Bone: Right temporal bone; squamous portion missing. Some
other decay evident; no gnawed areas visible.
Maxilla: Right maxilla only; fused with right zygoma. Zygoma is gnawed
by rodents; the frontal process of maxilla is destroyed by gnawing. Teeth are
present in alvolar area.
All eight teeth (normal for maxilla) were present at death; the central
incisor, canine, and first premolar are now missing. Of the remaining teeth: the
third molar (wisdom) has a cavity in grinding surface and another at gum line
next to second molar; there is a small "pearl" attached below the gum line to the
lateral surface of the third molar. The second molar has a similar "pearl" on its
lateral surface, plus another "pearl" at the base of a large cavity which faces
backward toward the matching cavity in the third molar. The first molar is
represented only by a stump sitting in its socket. This stump is mostly the root of

Forrester -- Two Henrietta Focus Sites

263

the first molar with a small amount of enamel remaining. The remaining premolar
(end premolar) is not diseased, nor is the remaining lateral incisor. Wear is quite
evident, but not excessive considering the age and dietary habits of the individual.
Mandible: Slightly more than half of the right half of the mandible is
present. The ramus is badly gnawed, as is the mental protuberance. The sockets
exist for a total of 12 teeth; this is the entire right side plus the two left incisors,
left canine and 1st premolar. Of these left four, only the lateral incisor is present.
Apparently all teeth were present at death, although the sockets of the two central
incisors, now missing, show a diseased condition. Of the normal eight teeth on
the right side, all are present save the two incisors. There is only one cavity
present in the existing teeth in the mandible section, it being in the grinding
surface of the third molar (wisdom tooth). The general appearance of the mandible is feminine.
Calvarium: The calvarium consists of the entire frontal bone, most of the
right and left parietals, and a small portion of the occipital, including the superior
angle. A large Wormian bone (preinterparietal) exists at the junction of the two
parietals and the occipital (lambda).
The occipital is gnawed almost entirely away; the fight parietal is gnawed
away at the mastoid angle, at sphenoid and temporal squama articulations. The
frontal bone is gnawed on both supraorbital borders and both zygomatic processes, and on the left nasal part. The orbital plates are missing. The coronal
suture closure has begun; the sagittal and sphenoidal sutures are in the process of
closing. The remaining portions of the lambdoid suture are partly closed. Age
would thus be estimated at around 25 years. The minimum frontal breadth is 87
mm; this seems markedly small for an adult, and so the skull appears when
viewed from the front. The calvarium is not marked by heavy muscle attachment
areas, indicating this is a female.
Teeth: Two loose teeth were found: the upper left incisor, and a third molar
from the left side; neither showed cavities.
Fragments: Six or eight very small fragments of bone, not positively identified as to source.
Based on the skeletal evidence discussed above, Burial 1 is that of a woman,
with slight build, about 22-25 years of age at death. Other than dental disease, no
bone diseases were noted.
Osteological Report: Skeletal Material from Burial 2
The skeletal material from Burial 2 shows tremendous damage due to both
natural decay of joints and spongy bone, and to attack by rodent activity. The
vast majority of the skeleton was missing entirely. Excavation (February 7,
1965) exposed the major portion of the left femur and some of the left (?) tibia in
its apparent burial position (fully flexed). The mandible, minus both rami, lay on
the same level, with the maxilla directly over it, touching at the dental areas. In

its appropriate anatomical position, the right temporal bone lay behind and to the
fight of the mandible and maxilla. A very few pieces of other bones were
scattered at random in the pit fill (Figure 9).

The few bones remaining would indicate that the body was laid on the left
side, fully flexed, with the head to the east. The skull as found must have been
dislocated by rodents.
The long bones (tibia and femur) were too damaged to provide information
other than that the individual was an adult. The mandible, missing its rami, offers
the most useful data: the individual was fully adult, robust, and probably male.
The teeth exhibit no cavities, but there are indications of alveolar disease, especially in the maxilla. All four wisdom teeth are present; the total wear on all
grinding surfaces is consistent with an individual about 35 years old.
Osteological Report: Skeletal Material from Burial 3
This skeletal material shows marked damage due to natural decay of joints
and spongy bone, and to attack by rodents. Most of the skeleton was missing
entirely, but excavation (May 15, 1966) showed the tibiae and femorae to be in
flexed position, left femur uppermost, thus indicating the body lay on its right

side; the head was probably to the west. The cranium was west of the legs, but
almost surely not in burial position. The burial was lined and covered with
sandstone slabs. No long bone was complete enough for height estimations. All
teeth were missing from the maxilla (postmortem loss); one tooth (lower right
canine) was found loose in the grave fill (Figure 10).
Calvarium -- complete except for loss of all teeth and some rodent-gnawed
areas. Cephalic index: 184/137 x 10 = 74.3 (barely within dolichocephalic range).
Calvarium is in good preservation, except for rodent-gnawing, and fairly recent
temporal bone damage due to rock pressure.

The range of cranial closures indicate an age at death of about 28 years.The
general impression of the cranium, including muscle attachments, indicates it
was probably that of a female.
