Hicks & Company Research Design for Survey of
the Proposed US 69/Loop 49 Lindale Relief Route in Smith County, Texas
CSJ: 0190-04-033
Temporary Tolling CSJ: 0190-04-900
January 31, 2008
This research design describes a 100% pedestrian, intensive linear archeological
survey along approximately 10 miles of proposed new roadway, the United States
Highway (US) 69/Loop 49 Lindale Reliever Route west of the City of Lindale. The
proposed highway will extend seven miles or 7.7 miles, depending on alternative chosen,
north from Interstate (IH) 20, around Lindale, and connect with United States Highway
(US) 69, approximately 1.5 miles north of the Lindale City Limits (Figure 1). The
project is composed of entirely new roadway with no proposed widening of existing
roadways. Funding for this project is being provided by the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) through its Tyler District and with the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA). While initially composed of seven alternatives (Alternatives
A-G), at this stage in the design and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
selection process, TxDOT and the design team have chosen two primary build
alternatives (Alternatives D [7 miles] and G [7.4 miles]). Alternatives D and G follow
the same alignment for the southern-most 3.7 miles then diverge at Farm to Market (FM)
16. Alternative G follows a similar, north then east trajectory as Alternative D except
diverging approximately one half mile farther to the north/west (Figure 1). The width of
new right-of-way (ROW) required for roadway construction varies from very thin slivers
at road spurs and crossings to nearly 800 feet in other locations. The average for the
main travel lanes, however, is between 400 and 500 feet in width. Including all projectrelated spurs and ROWs, the proposed undertaking’s Area of Potential Effects (APE) is
measured at approximately 423 acres for Alternative D and 450 acres for Alternative G.
Approximately 279 acres of each alignment is located in the southern half of the project
area where the two alignments follow the same corridor. As such the total area of new
ROW utilized by both proposed alignments is approximately 594 acres. ROE is available
to approximately 65-75 percent of the required new ROW (288 acres of Alternative D
and 330 acres of Alternative G or 446 acres along both alignments; Figure 1). The

1

TxDOT-Tyler District has expressed its desire to proceed with survey on those tracts that
are currently accessible. All proposed new ROW, for which ROE is available, will be
intensively surveyed and all investigations will meet or exceed the minimum standards
for linear archeological surveys as outlined by the THC and in the Texas Antiquities
Code (13 TAC 26.5 and 26.20).
With the exception of very small portions of existing ROW associated with the
proposed undertaking’s occasional road crossings, the project APE is entirely under
private ownership slated for State acquisition. While construction plans have not been
finalized at this time, vertical impacts averaging 10 feet (3.048 meters) in depth are
anticipated within the project area based on current designs.
Archeological evaluation of 100 percent of accessible ROWs is necessary to
fulfill TxDOT’s and FHWA’s cultural resource obligations under the Texas Antiquities
Code (13 TAC 26) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966 (as amended). Affected cultural resources will generally be described and
compared by alternative in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that is being
prepared for this project.
The proposed project area is in the East Texas Piney Woods. This area is
characterized by sandy soils and pine covered hills dissected by numerous drainage
courses. The project area is drained by several well-developed creek systems that flow
generally north-northeast in the Sabine River Basin to the north and south-southeast in
the Neches River Basin to the south. In general, the project alignment occupies primarily
rural/agricultural land with occasional urban development nearest northern and southern
termini.
Tertiary bedrock consisting of Sparta Sand, Weches Formation, and Queen City
Sand of Eocene Age, and Quaternary alluvium associated with major streams that drain
the project area characterize the geologic setting along the proposed alternatives for the
US 69 Lindale Reliever Route. Sparta Sand underlies much of the southern portion of the
project area, and consists of fine to medium grained, locally carbonaceous quartz sand
that is light gray to brownish gray in color and weathers to various shades of light gray.
The Weches Formation, also encountered most frequently in the southern portion of the
project area, is composed of thin-bedded grayish green to grayish olive green glauconite
and quartz sand interbedded with light brown to moderate light gray, silty, muscovitic
clay. Queen City Sand underlies much of the northern portion of the proposed alternative
routes, and is composed of fine grained to locally medium grained, light gray to brownish
gray, locally carbonaceous quartz sand and gray to brown, silty, slightly lignitic clay.

2

Alluvial stream-laid floodplain deposits consist of gravelly sand and mud. These
materials formed during relatively recent geologic time, and the alluvium entrained in the
channels of present streams, is still in the process of forming. Typically, these deposits
form nearly flat bottomlands and are encountered along the Hubbard and Stevenson
Branches of Duck Creek near the proposed routes’ intersections with County Road (CR)
431 (Old Mineola Highway).
Within the APE, a total of 18 soil series are present. The most prevalent of these
soils are; Pickton loamy fine sand on 1-6% slopes (PkC), Wolfpen loamy fine sand on 1­
6% slopes (WoC), and Redsprings very gravelly sandy loam on 8-25% slopes (RdE).
The Pickton sand is prevalent in the northern and central portions of the project area and
is defined as a gently sloping soil found on broad interstream divides in the uplands
(USDA 1993). This soil occupies roughly 25% (293 acres) of the project area. The
second most commonly encountered soil is the Wolfpen sand. This soil occupies
approximately 22% (260 acres) of the project area and shares the same basic definition as
the Pickton loamy fine sand as described above. Wolfpen loamy fine sand is encountered
equally throughout the length of the project area. Both Pickton and Wolfpan soils could
contain archeological deposits that would likely be on the surface or shallowly buried.
The third most common soil within the project area is Redsprings very gravelly sandy
loam. This soil occupies approximately 16% (195 acres) of the proposed project area on
steep slopes above drainages. Intact archeological sites are not likely to be encountered
in these areas. The greatest potential for archeological site preservation occurs in the
northern portion of the site area within the alluvial soils surrounding Hubbard Branch
Creek. The remaining soils that are encountered within the project area each comprise
less than 10% of the total area, some less than 1%.
Background research was conducted online at the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
to locate previous surveys and previously recorded archeological sites, NRHP-listed
archeological properties and SALs. The search found one previously recorded
archeological site within the APE of the undertaking, near the southern project terminus,
Site 41SM201. This site was recorded by Espey, Huston and Associates (EHA) in 1996
as part of an East Texas Electrical Cooperative survey. One well was encountered on the
site along with glass, metal, and plastic debris and modern bricks. One quartzite flake
was also found, but considered an isolated find. The area had been bulldozed prior to site
recording and no additional investigation was recommended. Although no information
specific to the nature of the EHA survey was available, one additional historic site was
recorded to the southwest of the project area as a result of the same investigations. This
site, 41SM202, consisted of a surficial scatter of historic debris with little research value.
No further investigation was recommended. There are two additional archeological sites

3

located within 1,000 meters of either of the proposed alternatives near the northern
project terminus (41SM163 and 41SM50). Very little information is available for Site
41SM163 (a likely Caddo site), however what is known is that it was recorded in 1985 as
part of the Big Sandy Archeological Survey Project. Equally sparse in background data,
Site 41SM50, a Frankston Phase Caddo site, contained dartpoint fragments and ceramic
sherds among the artifacts recorded. This site’s mapped location is an tentative
approximation that has not been field verified. Site 41SM7, a mound site for which very
little information is available, is mapped more than 1000 meters west of the APE and will
not likely be affected. However, this location is a tentative approximation from archival
data and is not conclusive. One historic/modern cemetery (Barber Cemetery) is located
on the outskirts of Lindale, approximately one mile east of the APE, and will not be
affected by the proposed undertaking. According to data available at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC), no additional surveys have been conducted that overlap or intersect with the
current project’s proposed APE (Figure 1).
The project is located within the Caddo region of Texas. Prehistoric sites in this
region are often found on the tops or side slopes of hills overlooking creeks and
waterways. Caddo sites can encompass a single prehistoric farmstead or be composed of
a village, hamlet, cemetery or larger agricultural complex. Artifacts and features within
these sites include pottery, bone, stone tools and related debris as well as structural
postholes, storage pits, agricultural field remnants and, on occasion, human burials.
Other prehistoric sites could include temporary camp sites and lithic scatters, among
others.
The proposed survey will take place on proposed new accessible ROW, currently
in private ownership and any existing TxDOT ROW that will be affected by the proposed
undertaking (namely at the project’s roadway crossings). The majority of accessible
properties appear to be largely undeveloped and as such, there is some potential for
unrecorded archeological resources to be affected by the Lindale Relief Route project,
particularly along hills and ridges overlooking drainage crossings (such as tributaries of
Duck Creek, Stevenson Branch, Hubbard Branch, Davis and Prairie Creeks, which cross
and run adjacent to the project APE), where Caddo and other prehistoric sites are
frequently recorded.
Shovel testing will be conducted at a rate of 16 tests per linear mile per 100 feet
of ROW width, in accordance with the THC’s minimum standards for linear
archeological survey. Archeologists can expect to follow four to six transects through
much of the alignment. Survey methods may vary from this standard in areas that

4

clearly lack the possibility of containing intact archeological properties (ie. disturbed
contexts, areas of exposed bedrock), and/or in areas with excellent surface visibility
(>30% surface visibility) or steep slopes (>20% grade). Shovel tests will be excavated to
a depth of one meter, to bedrock, or to culturally sterile soils, whichever is encountered
first. Soil from all shovel tests will be screened through ¼” hardware cloth. Investigators
will record their observations and the results of shovel tests through notes, standardized
shovel test forms, and photographs. At a minimum, all positive shovel tests will be
identified and mapped using GPS.
Right of Entry (ROE) is currently available to properties with the potential for
encountering deeper, alluvial settings, particularly along Stevenson Branch near CR 431.
As such, a backhoe may be employed at those locations if shovel testing indicates a need
for a mechanical supplement to survey. If backhoe trenching is required, trenches will be
excavated to the maximum depth of Holocene deposition or the maximum reach of the
backhoe (whichever is reached first). All trench excavations will be completed in
accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for
trench safety. Sediments from occasional bucket sweeps will be screened through ¼”
hardware cloth. Trenches will be recorded on standardized trench forms, along with
profile drawings, photographs, and any additional documentation deemed necessary.
Site identified during the course of survey will be assessed for size, depth,
composition, condition and basic significance to supplement regulatory recommendations
provided in the survey report and EIS. Site definitions will comply with THC/CTA
survey standards and policy including additional requirements for assessing historical
sites and cemeteries (see below). All archeological sites identified within the proposed
right-of-way during the survey will be investigated by means of no fewer than six shovel
tests in order to define site boundaries relative to the project corridor (unless excellent
surface visibility precludes the need for additional shovel testing). Site boundaries and
shovel tests will be mapped using sub-meter GPS technology. Specific site information
will be recorded on standardized forms and eventually presented to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for inclusion in their archives and, if
necessary, production of new site trinomials.
Previously recorded sites found within the project ROW (41SM201) will be
revisited and evaluated for their current composition, condition and potential for
NRHP/SAL eligibility in the same manner as any newly-discovered sites. If sites can not
be found in the vicinity of their mapped location, they will be recorded and presented as
such.

5

As per the THC’s policy on late-19th and early-20th-century sites (Denton 1999),
any historical sites identified during the survey will be documented not only through field
efforts, but also through survey level archival research. This research will include, but not
necessarily be limited to, census data, deed record research, and historic map research, in
order to assess the NRHP and SAL eligibility of the deposits. Census records for the
names of the individuals associated with the site will be checked, and the names of
individuals will also be checked in the New Handbook of Texas History. Based on a
combination of archival research and artifact analysis, investigators will make
recommendations for or against further archival or archeological work (outside the
current scope) to determine NRHP/SAL eligibility. In the event that a historic cemetery is
identified during field visits, additional archival research will be conducted and the
findings will be coordinated with TxDOT. If any historic cemeteries are identified within
the proposed project area, all work will immediately cease in the area pending
coordination with TxDOT.
Survey investigations will follow a modified no-collection policy. Isolated
surface finds, and non-diagnostic cultural material found in shovel tests will be
documented, counted and returned to their find location, and not saved for curation. At
the discretion of the Principal Investigator, select diagnostic artifacts from sites may be
collected. Artifacts that are returned to their find location will be documented to a level
appropriate of their significance through notes and/or photographs before discard. Any
artifacts collected from private property will be curated with a Deed of Gift form.
If possible, inaccessible properties will be visually assessed from an accessible
vantage for their potential for containing significant, intact cultural resources. Properties
lacking ROE that bear clear indications of disturbance or other factors that limit
archeological potential may be documented through notes and photographs and
recommended for no additional survey.
All work will be conducted under the terms and conditions of the First Amended
Programmatic Agreement (2005) among the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),
TxDOT, the THC and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the THC in support of
research for a project Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that is in production.
The results of the investigation will be compiled into a professional report as
required under Chapter 26 of the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure and in
conformance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (1966, as
amended). The report will describe the project area conditions and cultural background,

6

existing and newly-documented sites (including newly-produced site trinomials),
ownership of the site properties and NRHP/SAL eligibility of these sites based on the
requirements of 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1) and 13 TAC 26.20(2). In addition,
the report will include recommendations on the need for further investigations in
unsurveyed areas and, if necessary, at site locations. Two copies of this report will be
submitted to TxDOT-ENV and the THC for review and comment, and then resubmitted
following the address of any of these comments. All archeological sites located during
the survey will be recorded at TARL, and all project photographs, records, and artifacts
will be curated at that facility according to their standards. New site trinomials will be
generated in concert with this process. Upon acceptance of the draft report by TxDOTENV and the THC, 30 copies of the final report will be sent to TxDOT-ENV (20 of
which to be forwarded to the THC) to satisfy those conditions of the permit. All portions
of the proposed APE that could not be accessed due to lack of ROE that still require
survey will be relegated to a later survey and investigated under a different Texas
Antiquities Code permit.
