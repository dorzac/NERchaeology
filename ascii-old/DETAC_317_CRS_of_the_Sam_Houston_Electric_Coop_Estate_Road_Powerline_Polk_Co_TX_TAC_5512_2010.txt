ABSTRACT
In January 2010 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of the proposed Sam Houston Electric Cooperative
powerline right-of-way in Polk County, Texas. The pedestrian survey was conducted
with a combination of visual examination and shovel testing focusing on portions of the
powerline in Lake Livingston State Park. No archaeological sites were found; no cultural
material was collected. Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no
effect” to properties potently eligible for nomination to the NRHP for the powerline
right-of-way. No further work is recommended. However, if artifacts, bones, or dark
unexplained soils are observed in right-of-way clearing or pole excavation, then all work
should stop in the immediate area and DETAC should be consulted.

INTRODUCTION
In January 2010, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants)
conducted a cultural resources survey of a portion of the proposed Sam Houston Electric
Cooperative Estate Road Powerline Easement in the Lake Livingston State Park (Figure
1). Because the state park is a state agency, the survey was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit #5512. The report was reviewed by Texas Parks and Wildlife Parks
Division Cultural Resource Program and the Texas Historical Commission.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. The report was prepared following the short
report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a) with
modifications requested by the THC (Martin 1999). Shovel testing and visual inspection
within the powerline right-of-way found no archaeological sites or evidence of deeply
buried deposits.

Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no

effect” to potentially eligible NRHP cultural resources for the portion of the powerline
corridor within Lake Livingstone State Park.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project includes constructing approximately 0.15 hectares (0.37 acres) of
power line easement adjacent to Estate Rd. along the northern boundary of the state park.
The powerline will connect two existing powerlines. Planned work for the powerline
include clearing the right-of-way and drilling five holes for overhead powerline poles.
The powerline will parallel Estate Road and a narrow draw inundated with Lake
Livingston to the north.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, this portion of the Trinity River has been part of broad studies and
investigated in both larger examinations and numerous small surveys. The closest largescale investigations were conducted for Lake Livingston (Nunley 1963) and subsequent
testing of seven sites (McClurken 1968). More recently, Becker et al. 2000 conducted a
cultural resources survey of the Lake Livingston State Park documenting five sites.
Small-scale surveys were conducted for oil and gas exploration throughout the area, for
example, Bradle and Bernhardt (2005) and other utilities Galan (2000). A variety of
historic and prehistoric sites have been documented in investigations across the county, but
the sites excavated in the area are dominated by Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric Period
sites with a variety of dart and arrow points along with ceramic sherds, but little new
information because of the amount of mixing of the soils through natural and manmade
forces Keller and Weir (1979:2).
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The
documents of primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990)
discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. More specifically, Aten (1983) described coastal
adaptation while Shafer et al. (1975) describes inland adaptation along the lower Trinity
and Neches rivers to the southeast. Finally, Ricklis (2004:181-204) has the most up to
date description of region for southeast Texas which extends from the Gulf Coast to
Angelina County.
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 100
B.C. - A.D. 700), the more sedentary Late Prehistoric occupations (A.D. 700 - 1680), and
ends in the historic Euro American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993:44). The
Paleo-Indian period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of
hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals principally
distributed in the valleys of major stream basins (Ricklis 2004:184). The Archaic (7000200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). When compared to PaleoIndian artifacts, Archaic lithic assemblages are more functionally varied; however, tool

3

types are generally less well made and of increasingly more local materials than the
Paleo-Indian period and earlier Archaic (Ricklis 2004:184). Cemeteries date to the
Archaic period as well (Story 1990) and become an integral part of the late Archaic
(Ricklis 2004:186).

The Early Ceramic (100 B.C.-A.D. 600) period represents the

diffusion of Tchefuncte ceramics and later Goose Creek ceramic technology into the area
from the Texas-Louisiana coastal area (Aten 1983:297; Ricklis 2004:189). The paste of
these early ceramic styles change from sand temper around A.D. 1 to grog around A.D. 700
and bone around A.D. 1300 as the new technology diffused inland and merged with Caddo
influence from the north (Ricklis 2004:193-200). The late prehistory of south east Texas
began with the arrival of the bow and arrow and the wide spread of the grog tempered
pottery, e.g., San Jacinto Plain and Baytown Plain ceramics although earlier varieties
continued (Ricklis 2004:200). Larger aggregates of people became increasingly sedentary
with the introduction of the bow and arrow and populations specializing in environmental
zones (Aten 1983:91). These sedentary populations are know historically as the Bedai,
Deadose, Patiri,

and Akokisa tribes which are linguistically linked by the Atakapan

language (Newcomb 1961:316). The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the
history behind the current cultural setting of the area and marks a transition from the native
populations domination of the area, to the American immigrants establishment of farms,
towns, and counties. Early Ango settlement in the area focused on cash crops such as
cotton (Williams 2000:56) in the major river valleys as transportation relied on steamboats
(Utley and Corbin 2000:8). The arrival of the railroad and economic changes forced
landowners to change focus on timber in the later part of the nineteenth century. Today,
the area remains largely agricultural and produces crops including cotton, corn, hay and
vegetables. Beef and dairy cattle, as well as hogs, are also raised. The timber and oil
industries currently play a prominent role in the area’s commercial enterprises (THA 2009).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970);
the Archaeological Protection Act of 1979 (PL96-95; 16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm); and the
guidelines set forth by the CTA (1995b) and the Texas Antiquities Code.
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National
Park Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining
eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey areas. If sites were found, then the investigations were
to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity,
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP and SAL
eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using maps and files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and at the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2010).

The site location maps and cultural

resources records at the TARL were consulted to identify the location, types, and both
State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites
within or in close proximity to the project areas. The Site Atlas were consulted for
published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.
DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on visual examination and shovel testing. Visual examinations
were conducted in areas with exposed soil surfaces in a continuous effort between shovel
tests at all locations with exposed surfaces. Shovel testing was conducted in accordance
with the Texas Historic Commission’s guidelines for cultural resources surveys. Shovel
testing included excavating an area approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter in 10 cm
(4 inch) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix
was screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh screen. The depth, soil type, and
color of each shovel test were recorded along with a GPS location.

RESULTS
There are two documented cultural resources survey and nine previously recorded
sites within 1.6 km (1 mile) of the project area. The surveys were conducted for Lake
Livingston by the Texas Archaeological Salvage Project (Nunley 1963) and for the Lake
Livingston State Park by Stephen F. Austin State University (Becker et al. 2000). The
next closest archaeological surveys were conducted more than 3.5 km (2.2 miles) to the
south for utilities and roads.

Archaeological sites within 1.6 km include 41PK18,

41PK19, 41PK20, 41PK21, 41PK72, 41PK73, 41PK74, 41PK75, and 41PK76. Sites
41PK19, 41PK20, and 41PK21 were recorded as open campsites by Nunley (1963); site
41PK21 included decorated sandy paste ceramics, dart points, arrow points. Site 41PK21
was later excavated by McClurken (1968). Sites 41PK76 prehistoric open campsites
overlooking the Trinity River floodplain while sites 41PK72, 41PK73, 41PK74, were
recorded as prehistoric open camp sites on low mounds further from the river floodplain
and 41PK75 was recorded as a historic period road cut (Becker et al. 2000:29-30). None
of the sites were recommended for nomination to the NRHP or SAL; however, all were
recommend for further evaluation, monitoring for looting, and avoidance.
Topographically, the powerline follows Estate Road along the upland edge of a
draw inundated with Lake Livingston. Estate Road is a paved surface with maintained
ditches and cleared right-of-way. The powerline will connect two existing systems in a
new right-of-way paralleling the Estate Road right-of-way.

Vegetation along the

easement is mature pine forest with moderate understory of various bushes and shrubs
with a dense ground cover of leaf litter. Centerline stakes for the powerline are located
adjacent to the Estate Road right-of-way.
Geologic formations along the powerline are limited to the Pleistocene Beaumont
Formation (Qbs). These formations consists of thick beds of clay, silt, and sand along
relic river channels with pimple mounds on meander-belt ridges (BEG 1992). Based on
the age of the formation, the potential for buried cultural resources is limited. Soil series
along the right-of-way were described as Garner Clay (NRCS 2010). Garner series soils
included an Ap horizon 20 cm (7 inches) of clay over Bw and Bss clay horizons.

Combined, the previous investigations, topographic, geologic, and soils
information suggested the potential for buried cultural resources was minimal with the
exception of low mounded areas which may exist but not shovel tested in the 2000 survey
of the park by Becker and others. For the current investigations, shovel tests were
conducted for the entire length of the Estate Road powerline at 30 m (100 ft) intervals at
and between proposed pole locations outside the road right-of-way (Figure 2) and a
visual examination was conducted of exposed ground surfaces between shovel tests. No
artifacts were found in the shovel testing or visual examination. Soils in tests were
generally gray clay with red and yellow mottles (Table 1). No cultural material was
recovered and no archaeological sites were found.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed Sam Houston Electric Cooperative Estate Road powerline right-ofway will extend between two existing powerlines along the northern edge of Lake
Livingston State Park. Archaeological investigations included shovel testing and a visual
examination along the right-of-way. A total of eight shovel tests were excavated at 30 m
intervals along the length of the project area. No artifacts, buried soils or stratified
sediments were found.
Based on the investigations, there is little chance of encountering intact cultural
deposits or buried features in the project area. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with
the determination of “no effect” to properties eligible for nomination to the NRHP. If
artifacts, bones, or dark unexplained soils are observed in right-of-way clearing or pole
excavation, then all work should stop in the immediate area and both DETAC and the
TPWD Region 4 Cultural Resources Coordinator should be consulted. No further work
is recommended for the powerline
