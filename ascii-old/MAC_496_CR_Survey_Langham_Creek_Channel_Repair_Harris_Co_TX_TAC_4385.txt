ABSTRACT
On January 12, 2007, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural
resource survey investigation for an approximately 2500 ft (ca. 750 m) long and 100 ft (ca. 30.5
m ) wide right-of-way (ROW) along both banks of Langham Creek, in west Harris County,
Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify cultural materials, sites, or
historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare management recommendations
regarding any identified resources. The investigations were conducted for the Harris County
Flood Control District (Project ID U100-00-00-X015), under Texas Antiquities Permit Number
4385. An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted, and included both
surface and subsurface (shovel test) examination. A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated. No
evidence of archeological or historic remains was identified. Consequently, no further
archeological investigations are recommended. In the event that archeological deposits or
features should be encountered during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity
and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

INTRODUCTION
stream. Langham Creek flows southeast into
the Addicks Reservoir.

On January 12, 2007, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for a
proposed channel repair project along
Langham Creek, in west Harris County,
Texas. The objectives of the investigation
were to locate and identify cultural
materials, sites, or historic properties within
the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding
any identified resources. The investigations
(MAC PN 06-129) were conducted for the
Harris County Flood Control District
(Project ID U100-00-00-X015), under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 4385.

The purpose of the project is to
repair multiple severe slope erosions and
replace failed concrete channel lining
throughout this section of the channel.
Based on a comparison of USGS maps
(1915, 1918, 1949, 1955, 1970) and recent
aerial photographs (1990s) of the area, the
creek has been slightly channelized for
improved streamflow and drainage (Figure
2).
An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figure 3; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of 16 shovel
tests were excavated.
The field
investigations were conducted by project
archeologist Randy Ferguson and field
technician Darren Schubert. David Driver
served as the projectâs principal investigator.

The project area is depicted on the
Addicks, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The project
extends east from Queenston Boulevard, and
consists of an approximately 2500 ft (ca.
750 m) long and 100 ft (ca. 30.5 m ) wide
right-of-way (ROW) on each side of the

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Hydrology
The project consists of an
approximately 2500 ft (ca. 750 m) long
section of Langham Creek, which is a
tributary of the Addicks Reservoir system.
Based on a comparison of USGS maps
(1915, 1918, 1949, 1955, 1970) and recent
aerial photographs (1990s) of the area, the
creek has been slightly channelized for
improved streamflow and drainage (Figure
2)

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. San Jacinto
County is situated within the pine-oak
subdivision of the Austroriparian province
(Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the
dominant floral species of the pine-oak
forest subdivision as loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus
stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandica). Hardwood forests are found
on lowlands within the Austroriparian and
are characterized by such trees as sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa
sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra), and
other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as
well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss
(Tillandisia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal
glabra).

The project area is depicted on sheet
66 of the Soil Survey of Harris County
(Wheeler 1976).
The single soil type
present in the tract is Clodine loam (Cd).
This soil type is considered to be nearly
level in slope, and is identified as poorly
drained with very slow runoff (Wheeler
1976:14). Abbott (2001) defines Clodine
soils as upland loamy ancient (preHolocene) alluvium, with a low-moderate
potential for containing deeply buried
prehistoric sites.
Climate
The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys

snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)
may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for

6

to better exploit the various resources

available within their local environment.

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated
economic development of the county, and of
the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area

growing gas and oil industry was competing
with agricultural interests, and helped create
a significant boom in population.

prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a
steady stream of settlers to the region. By
the second decade of the 20th century, the

Moore
Archeological

literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological

literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined

flood control projects (Prikryl 1997; TARL
site forms).

The project is located on Langham
Creek, a tributary of Addicks Reservoir and
Buffalo Bayou. Buffalo Bayou represents a
major perennial waterway within the Harris
County area and has seen extensive
occupations along its banks during both
prehistoric and historic times. Some of the
earliest archaeological investigations in
Harris County occurred along Buffalo
Bayou in association with efforts to
channelize the watercourse, and in
preparation for the construction of Addicks
Reservoir (Wheat 1953; Neyland and
Worthington, TARL site files). During
1947, Wheat (1953) conducted a series of
surveys and excavations (Fields et al. 1983)
of areas within the reservoir impoundment
zone and along the creekbanks of several
nearby watercourses, including Buffalo
Bayou. During the late 1950s, Neyland and
Worthington,
two
local
avocational
archeologists, conducted surveys along
Buffalo Bayou in preparation for several

During
the
early
1980s,
archaeological investigations were once
again focused on the Addicks Reservoir area
(Fields et al. 1983).
Surveys were
concentrated only on properties considered
to have high probability for containing
cultural resources, an area totaling
approximately 36 percent of the 11,000 acre
reservoir (Prikryl et al. 1996:8-9). Thirty
nine new prehistoric sites were identified,
nine previously recorded prehistoric sites
were revisited, and 18 new historic sites
were located. The prehistoric sites tended to
be located on pimple mounds, levees, and
terrace remnants, and included Late Archaic
through Late Ceramic occupations.

Following these early investigations,
extensive site location and recording efforts
were conducted during the 1970s and 1980s
by Leland Patterson and members of the
Houston Archeological Society (HAS).
Three of the sites recorded by HAS are
located within or near the western end of the
current project (TARL site files). These
were located adjacent to original
(prechannelization) meanders, and included
41HR217, 41HR272, and 41HR311.
Described as possible campsites, all three
were represented by extremely limited
artifact scatters observed on the ground
surface.
No subsurface testing was
conducted at that time.

More recently, three small-scale
survey projects have been conducted along
nearby portions of Buffalo Bayou by Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc. (Prikryl
1997, 1998; Prikryl et al. 1996). Two of
these projects focused on areas in

preparation for floodwater detention basins
similar to that of the current project. Prikryl
(1997) examined 22 acres along the bayouâs
north bank, from Dairy Ashford Road to
Kirkwood Road. The investigation located
two new prehistoric sites, 41HR802 and
41HR803, and relocated one previously
recorded site, 41HR3.
Based on the
presence of intact deposits and a possible
feature, sites 41HR3 and 41HR802 were
identified as potentially significant, and
recommendations were made to facilitate
their avoidance during construction. The
light density of cultural materials and their
disturbed contexts resulted in site 41HR803
being ruled as having little potential
significance. Prikryl (1998) examined 48
acres along the bayouâs north bank, from
Kirkwood Road to Wilcrest Drive. The
project located one new prehistoric site
(41HR826) and relocated two previously
recorded sites, 41HR109 and 41HR110. A
third previously recorded site, 41HR111,
could not be found, and was assumed to
have been destroyed during the 1970s by
channel construction. Of the located sites,
41HR109 and 41HR826 were identified as

A third project conducted in the
immediate area by Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc. examined the confluence of
Rummel Creek and Buffalo Bayou in
preparation for the construction of a sewage
line (Prikryl et al. 1997). The investigations
located a single new prehistoric site,
41HR788.
The site was identified as
potentially significant and was subsequently
avoided by construction.
Although several historic sites were
located during survey for the Addicks
Reservoir, none have been previously
located in the current project area (Fields et
al. 1983; Howard and Freeman 1983).
However, at least eight historic homestead
sites are located within a distance of 1 km.
Several of these homesteads date to the mid
to late 1800s. A review of the 1915
Addicks, Texas, USGS topographic
quadrangle map, depicted a historic structure
located adjacent to the western boundary of
the current project area.

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
aerial photographs (1990s) of the area, the
creek has been slightly channelized for
improved streamflow and drainage (Figure
2).

The fieldwork was conducted on
January 12, 2007, and consisted of a 100%
pedestrian survey that included systematic
shovel testing and visual examination for
surface exposure of cultural materials.

A total of 16 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through Â¼â mesh (Figure 3;
Appendix 1). Each of the projectâs shovel
tests were recorded and plotted on the
project map. The tests were placed at
relatively even intervals of 100 m along
each bank of the stream. Approximately
half of the tests were able to reach to reach
ancient (pre-Holocene) subsoils (see
Appendix 1), while the remainder of the
tests documented deep modern flood
deposits and fills that often contained
evidence of disturbance (e.g., plastic cups
and other debris). No prehistoric or historic
cultural materials were found in any of the
shovel tests.

The project area is depicted on the
Addicks, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The project
extends east from Queenston Boulevard, and
consists of an approximately 2500 ft (ca.
750 m) long and 100 ft (ca. 30.5 m ) wide
right-of-way (ROW) on each side of the
stream. Langham Creek flows southeast into
the Addicks Reservoir.
The purpose of the project is to
repair multiple severe slope erosions and
replace failed concrete channel lining
throughout this section of the channel.

RECOMMENDATIONS
An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination. A total of 16
shovel tests were excavated. No evidence of
archeological or historic remains was
identified.
Consequently, no further
archeological
investigations
are
recommended.
In the event that
archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

On January 12, 2007, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for an
approximately 2500 ft (ca. 750 m) long and
100 ft (ca. 30.5 m ) wide right-of-way
(ROW) along both banks of Langham
Creek, in west Harris County, Texas. The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials, sites, or
historic properties within the proposed
impact area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 06129) were conducted for the Harris County
Flood Control District (Project ID U100-0000-X015), under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4385.
