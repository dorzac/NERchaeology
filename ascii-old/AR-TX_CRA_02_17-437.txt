MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Cultural Resource Analysts, Inc., personnel completed a records review and cultural resource survey
of a proposed well site, driveway, and water main to the west of the City of Brenham, in Washington
County, Texas. The proposed project area consisted of approximately .5 ha (1.3 acres) located east of the
intersection of Lange Lake Road and Lillie Lange Road, south of Highway 290. The cultural resource
survey was conducted at the request of O’Malley Strand Associates, Inc., on behalf of the Central
Washington County Water Supply Corporation. Because the project area will be purchased by the City of
Brenham, and municipalities are considered political subdivisions of the State of Texas, a Texas Antiquities
Permit was required for the completion of the work presented in this report (Permit No. 8190). This
management summary outlines the results of the file search and fieldwork and also provides
recommendations regarding cultural resource management for the proposed project.
The Phase I cultural resource investigation completed for this project included a records review and an
intensive archaeological survey, the fieldwork for which occurred on October 10, 2017. The records review
was conducted in two hours and the fieldwork took a total of 1.75 hours to complete. Jay W. Gray, MA,
RPA, served as Principal Investigator, and Jason Kennedy, MA, RPA, conducted the fieldwork. The
purpose of the survey was to locate, describe, evaluate, and make appropriate recommendations for the
future treatment of any historic or prehistoric archeological properties that may have been threatened by
the proposed drainage repair and improvement activities.
The records review for the project utilized online files on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission, to identify cultural resources or cultural resource
investigations previously documented within the vicinity of the project area. In addition, historical
quadrangle and soil maps obtained from the United States Geological Survey, as well as the United States
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service, were reviewed for the presence of
structures within the project areas. No previously documented archaeological sites were located within the
1.6 km (1.0 mi) records review buffer.
The field methodology consisted of intensive pedestrian survey supplemented by screened shovel tests.
The project area consisted mostly of hay field and a backyard. Surface visibility was variable, and when it
was sufficient, surface inspection was utilized to detect any artifacts or cultural soil horizons that had
become exposed. Shovel tests were excavated (according to Texas Historical Commission specifications)
in areas of low slope and that also had limited surface visibility due to vegetation or other ground cover.
Areas of fair to high ground surface visibility were investigated via pedestrian survey only. No
archaeological sites or standing architectural resources were documented as a result of the survey. Based
on the findings of the records review and cultural resource survey, no archaeological sites or historic
properties listed in, or recommended eligible for listing in, the National Register of Historic Places will be
affected by the proposed construction activities.
This project was completed in less than one week, and therefore the report follows the short report
content prescribed in the Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management Reports published by the Council
of Texas Archeologists.

that may be affected by the proposed activities.
The cultural resource survey was ordered because
the project area will be purchased by the City of
Brenham. Since municipalities are considered
political subdivisions of the State of Texas, a
Texas Antiquities Permit was required for the
completion of the work presented in this report
(Permit# 8190). All work associated with this
investigation was conducted pursuant to
standards set forth by the State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO) to comply with the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended, and specifically the
regulations for implementing Section 106 of the
Act (36 CFR 800).

C

ultural Resource Analysts, Inc. (CRA),
personnel completed a records review and
cultural resource survey of a proposed well site,
driveway, and water main, west of the City of
Brenham, Washington County, Texas (Figure 1).
This cultural resource survey was conducted at
the request of O’Malley Strand Associates, Inc.,
on behalf of the Central Washington County
Water Supply Corporation (CWCWSC).

Project Description
The proposed project area consisted of a
proposed well site, driveway, and water main
encompassing and area of .5 ha (1.3 acres). The
project area is depicted on the Brenham, TX 7.5minute quadrangle map. The project area
measures 67-x-51.5 m (220-x-169 ft) with the
proposed driveway measuring 111-x-10 m (364x-33 ft) from the western corner of the the area of
potential effect (APE). Additional details of the
project area are depicted in Figure 2.

Project Personnel
and Time Spent
Jay W. Gray, MA, RPA 989602, served as
principal investigator. The archeological file
search, using online files on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC), was
conducted by Jason Kennedy, MA, RPA
4768955, and took approximately two hours to
complete. Fieldwork was conducted by Jason
Kennedy and required 1.75 person hours to
complete. Jason Kennedy was the author of the
cultural resource survey report. The final report
production was completed by the CRA CAD and
publications departments. All field notes and
artifacts collected during the survey will be
curated with the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) of the University of Texas at
Austin.

Purpose of Study
The purpose of this assessment was to locate,
describe, evaluate, and make appropriate
recommendations for the future treatment of any
historic or prehistoric archeological properties

Summary of Findings
As part of the project, a records review was
conducted using online files available from the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by
THC to identify cultural resources or cultural
resource investigations previously documented
within the vicinity of the project area. No
previously documented archaeological sites were
located within the 1.6 km (1.0 mi) records review
buffer. According to data presented on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, no previous cultural
resource projects have been conducted within the
project area presented in this report.

APE, attention was paid to areas that provided
surface visibility. Shovel testing was performed
in areas that offered limited surface visibility,
typically due to vegetation.

The field methodology consisted of intensive
pedestrian survey supplemented by screened
shovel tests. Surface visibility along the project
area was varied, and when sufficient, surface
inspection was utilized to detect any artifacts or
cultural soil horizons that had become exposed.
Shovel tests were excavated in areas of low slope
and that also had limited surface visibility (< 30
percent) due to vegetation or other ground cover.
Areas of fair to high ground surface visibility (>
30 percent) were investigated via pedestrian
survey only.

Shovel tests were circular holes measuring
35.0 cm (13.8 in) in diameter excavated in most
cases to sterile subsoil. All fill removed from the
tests was screened through .64 cm (.25 in) mesh
hardware cloth, exposed profiles in each shovel
test were recorded on standardized recording
forms, and the sidewalls and bottoms of the
shovel tests were examined for artifacts, potential
cultural soil horizons, and features.

Based on the findings of the fieldwork, no
cultural resources were observed and a No
Historic Properties Affected determination is
recommended for this project in support of a
categorical exclusion for the National
Environmental Policy Act study.

Soil profiles exposed in each excavated
shovel test were recorded using standardized
recording forms. Shovel test form entries
included the unique designation for each shovel
test along with shovel test status (positive,
negative, or unexcavated along with explanation
if the shovel test could not be excavated); and the
depth, soil texture, and predominant color of each
stratigraphic zone encountered (including
disturbances).

Report Organization
This report is intended to follow the
suggested format for a Short Report, as presented
in the Council of Texas Archeologists Guidelines
for Cultural Resource Management Reports. It is
organized into 5 numbered sections. Section I
provides an overview of the project and
summarizes the results of the archeological
investigation. Section
II
explains
the
methodological approach employed in the
cultural resources survey, while Section III
details the results of the records review. Section
IV elaborates on the results of the archeological
investigation as well
as
management
recommendations. Report summary and
recommendations regarding future work in the
project area are presented in Section V. Résumés
for all key personnel are included as appendices
to this report.

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinates were recorded using ESRI ArcPad 11
software on a GeoExplorer 3000 Series GeoXT
handheld global positioning system (GPS) unit
manufactured by Trimble to verify locations
within the project area with greater than ± 5 m (16
ft) accuracy. Data was collected using the North
American Datum (NAD) 1983 projection. The
locations of all shovel tests and areas of
pedestrian survey were recorded in this manner.
All locations were collected as point files.

III. RECORDS REVIEW

T

he records review for this project consisted of
a search of the online files on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, maintained by the
Texas Historical Commission to identify cultural
resources or cultural resource investigations
previously documented within the vicinity of the
project area. According to data presented on the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, no previous
cultural resource projects have been conducted
within the project area presented in this report and
no previously documented archaeological sites

II. RESEARCH DESIGN
AND FIELD METHODS

his section describes the field research
methods used during the survey to achieve
project goals. The project area was systematically
investigated by pedestrian survey utilizing
surface visibility, supplemented with the
excavation of screened shovel tests. Within the

were located within the 1.6 km (1.0 mi) records
review buffer.
Available historic maps of Brenham were
also reviewed to supplement the records review.
These included the 1930 Brenham, TX Tactical
Quadrangle Map (prepared in 1919) and the 1963
Brenham, TX 7.5-minute quadrangle map. The
earlier of these maps is somewhat difficult to
overlay on modern mapping due to the scale of
the depicted roads and structures, and on
georeferenced versions it is clear that inaccuracy
and distortion have caused some misalignments.
However, because the project area is near an
existing drainage, it was possible to get a
generally good sense of where historically
mapped roads and structures were in relation to
the project location. The later map is
characterized by a much greater level of
accuracy. For the Brenham 1930 TX Tactical
Quadrangle Map it appears that the project area is
located in an area between two structures that
may be larger than the overall project area but due
to the errors in scale, this is difficult to determine.
An examination of the 1930 Brenham, TX
Tactical Quadrangle Map (prepared in 1919) and
the 1963 Brenham, TX 7.5-minute quadrangle
maps do not depict any structures in the vicinity
of these locations during the early to midtwentieth century (United States Geological
Survey [USGS] 1930, 1963).

V. CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS

C

ultural Resource Analysts, Inc., personnel
completed a records review and cultural
resource survey of a proposed well site,
driveway, and water main west of the City of
Brenham, Washington County, Texas. The APE
consisted of .5 ha (1.3 ac), and was located east
of the intersection of Lange Lake Road and Lillie
Lange Road south of Highway 290. This cultural
resource survey was conducted at the request of
O’Malley Strand Associates, Inc., on behalf of
CWCWSC.
As part of the project, a records review was
conducted utilizing online files on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, maintained by the
Texas Historical Commission, to identify cultural
resources or cultural resource investigations
previously documented within the vicinity of the
project area. In addition, historic maps were
reviewed for the presence of structures within the
survey area. According to data presented on the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, no previous
cultural resource projects have been conducted
within the project areas presented in this report.
No previously documented archaeological sites
were located within the 1.6 km (1.0 mi) records
review buffer.

IV. RESULTS

T

ne cultural resource survey was conducted on
October 10, 2017. The project area was
subjected to the field methods described in
Section 3.

The field methodology consisted of intensive
pedestrian survey supplemented by screened
shovel tests. Surface visibility along the project
area varied, and when sufficient, was utilized for
surface inspection to detect any artifacts or
cultural soil horizons that had become exposed.
Shovel tests were excavated in areas that had
limited surface visibility (< 30 percent) due to
vegetation or other ground cover. Areas of fair to
high ground surface visibility (> 30 percent) were
investigated via pedestrian survey only.

The APE (depicted in Figure 3) is east of the
intersection of Lange Lake Road and Lillie Lange
Road, west of the city of Brenham, Texas. The
corridor for the proposed access road is in the
back yard along the property line (Figure 4). The
proposed well site is located on the top and side
slope of a hill in a hay field (Figure 5). In total,
seven shovel tests (STP) were excavated with one
test location pedestrian surveyed. Shovel tests
were excavated to an average depth of 40 cm (16
in) below ground surface (bgs) with the top zone
20 to 35 cm (8 to 14 in) bgs. Soils were darker

The fieldwork resulted in the excavation of
seven shovel tests and one test location pedestrian
surveyed. No archaeological sites or standing
architectural resources were documented as a
result of the survey. Based on the findings of the
records review and cultural resource survey, no
archaeological sites or historic properties listed
in, or recommended eligible for listing in, the
National Register of Historic Places will be
affected by the proposed construction activities.
Based on the findings of the fieldwork, a No
Historic Properties Affected determination is
recommended for this project in support of a
categorical exclusion for the National
Environmental Policy Act study.
If any previously unrecorded archeological
materials are encountered during construction
activity, the THC should be notified immediately.
If human skeletal material is discovered, the
construction activities should cease, THC and
local law enforcement should be contacted
immediately, and THC guidelines should be
followed.
