ABSTRACT
In July 2014 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of the proposed Lindale Community Park with
National Recreational Trails Funds administered by Texas Parks and Wildlife. The initial
phase of park development is a cement walking trail, trail side amenities, and three
parking areas; however, future development will impact a majority of the park property;
therefore, the entire property (9.6 hectare (23.6 acres)) was surveyed. The pedestrian
survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #6931 in compliance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas. The investigations included a combination of visual
examination, shovel testing, and archival research. The visual examination and
documentation provided by the City of Lindale at the time of the survey revealed that an
early to mid-twentieth century house was on the property. The house and associated out
buildings were remove as an environmental hazard when the city purchased the property.
Shovel testing found modern material in the upper 30 cm (12 in) of shovel tests near the
house location but no foundations or other features were found. No artifacts were
curated. Archival research found that the property was in the same family since the turn
of the century. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect”
to State Archaeological Landmarks or National Register of Historic Places eligible
properties for the proposed project.

INTRODUCTION
In July 2014, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resources survey of the proposed Lindale Community Park and associated
facilities in Lindale, Texas (Figure 1). The survey was conducted at the request of the
City of Lindale in compliance with the Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) Grant
Application for the National Recreational Trails Fund. The project was reviewed by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) under Section 106 and Texas Antiquities Permit
#6931 in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) because the
money for the project is provided by the Federal Government and the Antiquities Code of
Texas because the funds are used by a subdivision of the State of Texas.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. Analysis of air photos show the property
was primarily agricultural fields except for an early to mid-twentieth century house in the
south-central portion of the property. This house, surrounding sheds, abandoned cars,
and other debris was photographed in an environmental study then removed by the city as
a hazard. Surface debris and scattered material in shovel tests confirmed the modern
dates. The location was not recorded as an archaeological site. No artifacts were
collected during the survey; therefore, no artifacts were curated.
The report was prepared following the short report format outlined by the Council
of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a) with modifications requested by the THC (Martin
1999). Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no effect” to
National Register of Historic Places eligible or State Archaeological Landmarks cultural
resources for the proposed trail provided the foundations and the stone are not disturbed.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed park is a multi-phase project. This initial funding was for an ADA
compliant, multi-use trail roughly 1,159meter (m) (3,800-foot (ft)) long with a bridge
over an intermittent drainage, three parking areas, and trail side amenities (two rest
stations, restrooms, water fountain). The trail will be a concrete surface trail 1.8 m (6 ft)
wide in a 9.2 m (30 ft) wide right-of-way, the parking areas will be roughly 0.18 hectare
(ha) (0.43 acre (ac)) each, and small areas less than 10 m (33 ft) square will be used for

trail side amenities. Future phases of the project include utilizing more of the property
than the trail. None of the proposed features were marked at the time of the survey.
Given the size of the property, 9.6 ha. (23.6 ac.), and the absence of trail, parking area, or
amenities marking on the ground, it was easier to survey the entire property instead of the
trail, parking, and amenities areas only.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Smith County was part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The large area investigations in the area are
limited to those along Lake Fork Reservoir (e.g., Brusheth et al 1977) to the northwest
and Lake Palestine (e.g., Keith 1971) to the south. Large linear surveys were conducted
for new roads around Tyler and Lindale (e.g., Campbell et al. 2008). The smaller surveys
were typically for road and water system improvements (e.g., Nelson and Perttula 2012).
These investigations found, tested, and conducted data recovery efforts on a variety of
historic and prehistoric sites. Most of the surveys mentioned above focused on low lands
and areas adjacent to perennial streams and well developed floodplains. The numerous
small surveys in the area include both upland and lowland settings. The investigations
that documented archaeological sites found that prehistoric and early historic sites were
found adjacent to stream channels in the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe
slopes of higher ridges.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region.
Initially, D.A. Story and others (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) describe the prehistoric
cultures of the Gulf Coastal Plain from southwest Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. The
Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Perttula and Kenmotsu
1993). This document includes several historic contexts, each of which deals with a
particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407)
describes the Caddoan archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses the area
between the Red River in the north, the Trinity River in the west, and Angelina River in the
south.

3

The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200
B.C. - A.D. 800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the
historic Euro American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian
period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and
gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic
(7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200
B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing
utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens,
prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle,
and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of
northeast Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture
(A.D. 800-1600). This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323).

Larger

aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial
areas.

Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds (Perttula

2004:379). A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level
as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also
established. The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the
current cultural setting of the area and marks the expulsion of native populations and the
progression of the American immigrants as they established farms, towns, and counties.
The earliest American settler was Elijah Lindsey who founded Lindseydale in 1871
(Smallwood 1999:161). The town name changed in 1874 to Lindale shortly before the
railroad arrived in 1875. Cotton and fruit were the major crops grown in the area. The J.S.
Ogburn and Company Canning Factory was established in 1895 (McCroskey 2010). The
turn of the century saw the arrival of Lindale Reporter newspaper and the Brazelton Prior
Lumber Company (McCroskey 2010). The town continued to expand throughout the
twentieth century as the population of Tyler grew and more people traveled along
Interstate 20.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA
and the Texas Antiquities Code following survey standards described by the Texas
Historic Commission (2014) and report guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). The
purpose of these investigations was to locate prehistoric and historic cultural resources
within the project area, delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, and make
a preliminary evaluation of each site's integrity and potential for State Archaeological
Landmark (SAL) designation and/or National Register of Historic Properties (NRHP)
eligibility. All fieldwork and reporting comply with the ethics standards of the Texas
Archaeological Society and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2014). The atlas contains a current
database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys,
archaeological site location maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these records
show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded
sites. During the survey, the City of Lindale provided information gathered during the
environmental study in 2007. This information contained photographs of the property
before it was cleared and aerial photos of the property spanning the past 60 years. After the
field survey, DETAC conducted archival research at the East Texas Research Center
(ETRC) in the Library at Stephen F. Austin State University. The records at the ETRC
contain census records obtained online and books about the history of Lindale and Smith
County.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area relying on
shovel testing and visual examination to locate archaeological sites within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE). Shovel testing included excavating an area approximately 30
centimeters (cm) square in 10 cm (4 in) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35
in).

According to the THC guidelines, the pedestrian survey included a surface

inspection focused on areas with exposed soil (e.g., erosional features and ant mounds)
along with a minimum of 12 shovel tests in the 9.6 ha (23.6 ac) area. Shovel test
locations were recorded with Ashtech GPS units with sub-meter post-processing
accuracy. Notes were made about soil color, texture, and shovel test depth.

RESULTS
The project area includes a 9.6 ha (23.6 ac) property at the northeast corner of E
North Street and N Industrial Street. There is a second portion of the property south of E
North Street. The initial phase of development on the property includes a trail, three
parking areas, and trail side amenities. The trail will be a concrete surface trail 1.8 m (6
ft) wide in a 9.2 m (30 ft) wide right-of-way, the parking areas will be roughly 0.18
hectare (ha) (0.43 acre (ac)) each, and small areas less than 10 m (33 ft) square will be
used for trail side amenities. One bridge will be over a drainage channel near the north
central portion of the property.
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2014) found no archaeological investigation within 1.6 kilometers (km) (1 mile (mi)) of
the project area. The closest documented archaeological investigation was for a water
well and pipeline roughly 2.5 km (1.5 mi) east of the project area; no sites were recorded
(Nelson and Pertula 2012). The next closest archaeological survey was for a Loop
around Lindale roughly 3.5 km (1.9 mi) northwest of the project area (Campbell et al.
2008). Five archaeological sites were found in two alternative routes of which one site,
41SM393, was part of a testing effort (Haefner et al. 2012). There is one historical
marker in the Lindale city limits for the Whisenhunt-Kinzie House (Marker 15545) near
the center of town.
The information provided by the City of Lindale included photos of the property
before it was cleared of environmental hazards (Appendix A). The report contains
Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from 1926; aerial photos from 1949, 1958, 1968, 1980,
1995, and 2005; and 36 photos taken in between 2005 and 2007. The City of Lindale
also provided survey plats of the property. The project area was purchased by the City of
Lindale from two private owners; Stanton and Darden. The Stanton property is a 4.557
ac area in the northwest corner of the project area. The Darden property is an 18.99 ac
area containing the remainder of the project area. Information about the property is
provide in chronological order below.
The 1926 Sanborn Fire Insurance maps show the railroad tracks west of the
property at the eastern edge of the map. The project area is not visible on the maps. The
aerial photos from 1949, 1958, 1968, and, 1980 show most of the project area is

6

cultivated fields with a stand of trees along the drainage and near the south central
portion of the project area. The photos are poor quality black and white making buildings
difficult to distinguish. The 1995 aerial photo is a high resolution color infra-red image.
Most of the project area appears to be grass with a stand of trees along the drainage
channel. A road is visible in the south central portion of the project area. A house with a
pyramid roof is visible along with several smaller out buildings or cleared areas along
either side of the road. The 2005 aerial photo is a NAIP image showing an expanded area
of trees and less grass covered areas. The house is visible only as a light dot as the image
is from the spring or summer time with maximum vegetation cover.
The 36 environmental study photos show a house and several small buildings with
modern debris. The house is a square style structure on a pier and beam foundation with
horizontal siding. The foundations appear to be brick and mortar. Windows appear to be
1 over 1 single pane. The roof is a corrugated tin pyramid hip construction. All of these
features suggest the house is from the first half of the twentieth century. The out
buildings are earth-fast frame structures. Some are made with machine cut timbers and
vertical board and batten exteriors while others are frame structures with corrugated tin
walls. These buildings are dilapidated and filled with modern household debris (e.g.,
paint cans, tires, etc). Several vehicles from the 1930’s to the 1970’s are shown in the
photographs.
The information in the environmental study shows the property was used for
agricultural purposes in the twentieth century. The owner most likely lived on the land in
the house which was built in the first half of the twentieth century.
Research at the East Texas Research Center revealed that the first Darden in
Smith County was Emanuel J Darden who was born in Alabama in 1872. Census records
show that he was married and owned a house in Lindale on Strainer Street in 1900. His
occupation was listed as “general farmer” (USCB 1900). Emanuel had three children and
lived at the same location in the 1930 census. One of his decedents, Lola Darden Lewis,
sold the property to the city. There is no mention of the Darden family in county
literature beyond the census information. There is no Strainer Street currently listed in
Lindale or visible on maps of the city; however, the Darden family owned the property
throughout the twentieth century and most likely built the house and cultivated the land.

7

Topographically, the property is on the shoulder of a wide upland ridge dissected
by several intermittent drainages which form named streams between 1.6 and 2.4 km (1
and 1.5 miles) from the project area. Vegetation varied from pasture grasses near the
streets to mature mixed hardwood and pine trees with a dense understory near the
drainage. Soils are exclusively Wolfpen (WoC) (NRCS 2014). Wolfpen series soils
include A and E horizons 50 to 65 cm (20 to 27 in) deep over a sandy clay Bt horizon.
Surface inspection of the project area found half of the surface was covered in
pasture grasses. The central portion and northeast corner of the property was in a stand
of mixed hardwood and pine trees with a moderate to dense understory of various bushes
and shrubs. Ground cover in the wooded area was leaf litter. Modern features include a
city sewer line bisecting the property from north to south, buried fiber-optical and electric
cables. There are 16 pecan trees in two parallel rows in the south central portion of the
project area with patches of exposed soil and an upturned segment of 30-inch cement
pipe east of the rows of trees (Figure 2). The cement pipe was interpreted as a well
although no well was noted in the environmental study. Surface inspection of the area
around the trees found several modern brick fragments, a plow blade, several metal
objects, and modern ceramic shards. North of the rows of pecan trees are several piles of
debris and scattered household items that include a refrigerator, tractor parts, and
remnants of a corral.

Correlation with the aerial and ground photos from the

environmental study found this is the area with the house and several out buildings.
A total of 35 shovel tests were excavated across the project area with an emphasis
on elevated landforms overlooking the drainage channel (Figure 3 and Table 1). Fewer
tests were excavated in disturbed areas adjacent to modern road surfaces, a sewer line,
and the steeper, concave slopes. The southwest corner of the project area was avoided
because several fiber-optic and electrical boxes were observed in the area. Most shovel
tests were light brown to light yellowish brown sandy loam 40 to 90 cm (16 to 36 in)
deep. Reddish brown and mottled soils were more common near the existing road
surfaces and other modern disturbances. Shovel tests J11 and J12 contained modern
brick, bottle glass, and plastic in the upper 30 cm (12 in) in disturbed soil. No material
was found below Level 3 even though both tests were excavated to 50 cmbs (20 inbs).
None of the material found in the shovel testing effort was collected.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The City of Lindale, Texas will use Federal funds administered by the Texas
Wildlife Department to build a trail, trail side amenities, and parking areas on unused
property.

The project was reviewed under Section 106 of the National Historic

Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The archaeological survey was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #6931.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. Aerial and ground photo analysis combined
with surface inspection and shovel testing confirmed the presence of an early to midtwentieth century house in the south-central portion of the property. The house, modern
debris and associated out buildings were removed as an environmental hazard when the
city purchased the property. No artifacts were collected during the survey; therefore, no
artifacts were curated. Archival research revealed the property was in the same family
throughout the twentieth century. The house was most likely built in the early to midtwentieth century and was continually use as a residence or as a storage place until the
property was sold to the city.
Based on the shovel test results, the visual examination, and the disturbance in
clearing the property, there is little chance of encountering any additional undiscovered
cultural resources in the project area; however, in the event that human remains and/or
archaeological materials are discovered during construction, then the project activity will
cease in the immediate area and DETAC shall be notified of the discovery. DETAC
requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible
for the NRHP as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act and SAL as defined
by the Antiquities Code of Texas.
