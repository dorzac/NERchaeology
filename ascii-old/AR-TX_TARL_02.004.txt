ABSTRACT
Following cultural resource surveys conducted as part of planning and formal applica­
tion for development of the Calvert Mine, a lignite operation in northwestern Robertson
County, it was determined that measures should be taken to mitigate the proposed loss
of one historic site, 41RT260, and to assess the potential eligibility of six additional
properties for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
In January, 1989, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of
Texas at Austin, submitted a comprehensive plan for the scope of work that would be
required. The following month, a field crew began implementing the plan, which in­
volved archeological testing, oral history interviews, archival research, artifact analysis,
photodocumentation, and, for 41RT260, measured architectural drawings conforming to
standards of the Historic American Building Survey (HABS) program. All work was
conducted in consultation with the staff of the Texas Historical Commission, the state's
historic preservation office.
The mitigative phase of the intensive research plan resulted in an appropriate and
successful treatment of 41RT260, the Weaver-Rushing house. Located near the center
of a dispersed rural community known as Tidwell Prairie, the house and surrounding
farmstead reflect the settlement's period of significance, from the late nineteenth century
to the 1940s. Field notes, original architectural drawings, and additional documentation
are on file at the Texas Historical Commission and the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. In addition, HABS-quality architectural drawings were provided to the
architecture departments at The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A & M Univer­
sity.
The six sites slated for additional testing and research represent former dwellings also
associated with Tidwell Prairie; A combination of oral history, archival research, map­
ping and photodocumentation, and subsurface probes provided information on site
layout, function and history. The research potential of five sites, 41RT251, 41RT252,
41RT258, 41RT261, and 41RT271, was fully exploited by this program and none meet
criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The sixth site, 41RT254,
the Ed Okonski site, is an intact example of the development of a rural farmstead in
Robertson County and is eligible for listing on the basis of its architecture and layout.
The site is privately owned and operated, and will not be affected under current mining
plans, so no further work is warranted at this time.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
In the preparation of this report, as in earlier investigations in the Walnut Creek mine
project area, current and former residents of Tidwell Prairie proved especially helpful in
reconstructing the community's history. A special thanks goes to Richard Hailey, Frieda
Rehberg Rains, Molly Williams Hamilton, Ted Yezak, Reece Yezak, and Ed Okonski, who
allowed us the opportunity to share their remembrances in this report. Richard Hailey,
in particular, provided important information on families associated with specific sites.
His knowledge of the community and his respect for its heritage are greatly appreciated.
Ken Ratliff of Phillips Coal Company has been closely associated with the Calvert
Mine throughout the cultural resource program. The staff of the Walnut Creek Mining
Company, especially Roger Burton and Bruce McKay, worked as liaisons between the
company, the landowners, and the field crew. Their assistance in providing access to sites
and to historical land records was especially beneficial.
During the testing and mitigative phases of this report, the staff ofthe Texas Historical
Commission provided important comments and perspectives. Dan Prikryl of the agency's
Review and Compliance department visited Tidwell Prairie on several occasions and
offered recommendations on the scope and quality of the archeological investigations.
Rick Lewis of the Architecture division served initially as the primary agency resource
for information on the proposed architectural mitigation at 41RT260. In the review
process, Joe Swick represented the Environmental Protection Agency, the lead federal
department on the project.
Dan Julien at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory provided valuable assis­
tance in photographing the sites and in developing computerized maps of project
properties. The archeological field crew consisted of Karl Kleinbach, Bill Chandler, and
Joe Sanchez. Equally important were the contributions of Kelly Scott, who performed
able assistance with typing, editing, and final production. Much credit is due her because
of her attention to detail and her adherence to high standards of quality.
Two other employees ofthe Texas Archeological Research Laboratory deserve special
mention. Laura Hillier ran the lab, cataloging such diverse artifacts as bottles, spark
plugs, silverware, and a pink flamingo. Solveig Turpin, as usual, directed the overall
project ably as Principal Investigator. She worked directly in all phases of the work,
visiting each site several times and offering her ideas on planning, testing procedures,
and analysis.
The architectural phase of the project was conducted by John Volz and Associates of
Austin. Field investigators for the firm were John Volz and Ralph Edward Newlan. The
latter produced the very detailed and thorough HABS-quality drawings of the Weaver­
Rushing farmstead.

INTRODUCTION
In 1989, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), The University of
Texas at Austin, carried out two phases of historical research in the Calvert Mine,
Robertson County, Texas for Walnut Creek Mining Company. First, historical, architec­
tural, and archeological investigations were conducted to mitigate the impact of mine
development on the Weaver-Rushing house (41RT260), a site previously determined
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (Fig. 1). This turn-of-the­
century farmstead and former site of a general store was an integral part of Tidwell
Prairie, a dispersed rural community established by Polish, Black, and Anglo settlers in
the 1870s and abandoned after the economic crisis of the 1930s. The second phase
consisted of archeological testing of six historic sites to determine their potential
eligibility for the NRHP. All are former dwellings also associated with Tidwell Prairie.
The two phases of historical research share a common background, presented here as
Section I. The mitigative action at the Weaver-Rushing house comprises Section II and
the limited testing of six other farmsteads is reported as Section III.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH

The investigations reported herein continue cultural resource evaluation of the Cal­
vert Mine by The University of Texas at Austin for Phillips Coal Company, their agent
Morrison-Knudsen Company, Inc., or the mine operators, Walnut Creek Mining Com­
pany. Archeological and historical research in the Calvert Prospect began in 1978 with
a random transect survey that sampled 12 percent of the 30,000 acres then under
consideration for mining by Phillips Coal Company (Good, Turpin, and Freeman 1980).
It was noted that two types of economic development in the county had created
geographically separate types of settlement. In the eastern portion, along the Brazos and
Little Brazos rivers, wealthy planters exploited the rich bottomlands using methods
brought from the Deep South. Smaller, less prosperous farms based in a subsistence
economy characterized the northern and eastern sections, including the area of Tidwell
Prairie.
In 1985, when mining plans were finalized, Phillips Coal Company sponsored the
intensive survey of 4800 acres composed of two mine blocks, a plant site, an ash disposal
area, and access roads (Davis and Utley 1987). Forty-six historic sites were recorded; the
majority were associated with the dispersed farming community of Tidwell Prairie. They
included farmhouses, sharecropper houses, and associated outbuildings distributed
across the broad upland divide, as well as institutions, such as the church, school,
cemetery, stores, gin, and mill. All the sites postdate the mid-1870s when the area was
initially opened for permanent settlement and a railroad line was constructed in the
vicinity, near present Hammond.

4 I TIDWELL PRAIRIE

Immediately following the intensive survey, two additional tasks were implemented
for Phillips Coal Company. Prehistoric site 41RT267 was tested to determine its
eligibility for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (Davis and Tomka
1987) and a draft management plan for future development of the Calvert Mine was
prepared (Davis, Turpin, and Utley 1987). The Texas Historical Commission (THC) and
the Environmental Protection Agency agreed that 41RT267 and the Weaver~Rushing
house, 41RT260, met criteria for listing on the NRHP and a determination of eligibility
was confirmed by the Keeper of the Register (National Park Service 1987).
In 1989, after Walnut Creek Mining Company assumed responsibility for mine opera­
tions, the proposed management plan for the Calvert Mine was finalized (TARL 1989a),
enabling additional historic site testing to proceed within the context of an approved
research design. A mitigation plan for NRHP property 41RT260 was approved, imple~
mented and completed (TARL 1989b). The mitigative actions included: measured
architectural drawings to appropriate Historical American Buildings Survey (HABS)
level; photographs of the house using a 4" x 5" format; test excavations and full~scale
excavations as needed; and additional oral history and archival research. Concurrently,
sites 41RT251, 41RT252, 41RT254, 41RT258, 41RT261, and 41RT271 were tested follow­
ing the general methodology outlined in the management plan.
METHODS

Dan K. Utley, historian for TARL, conducted the archival and oral history research,
focusing upon the community of Tidwell Prairie. Central to the research plan was a chain
of title, from sovereignty of the soil to the present. Documents used in compiling the
ownership record, including deeds, affidavits, and court records, were located in the
holdings of the county and district clerks at the Robertson County Courthouse in
Franklin. Additional courthouse records, such as naturalization papers, probate records,
leases (oil, gas, and mineral), and tax abstracts, were used to confirm and enhance the
material in the title chain. Information on original grantees came from the Archives and
Records Division of the General Land Office in Austin.
State death records, available in the State Archives at Austin, were reviewed for
individuals and their spouses included in the chain of title. When specific death dates
were verified, an effort was made to locate obituaries in newspaper collections. The
Barker Texas History Center, on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin, was the
principal resource for back issues of the Calvert, Bremond, Franklin, and Hearne papers.
In addition, the staff of the Calvert Tribune provided several issues containing historical
articles on the families of the Tidwell Prairie area.
General background information on Robertson County, as well as specific material
on such communities as Hammond, Tidwell Prairie, and Bremond, came from a variety
of secondary sources. County history books, newspaper articles, and cemetery surveys
were the most commonly used.
The viability of the complementary oral history program was determined by the
presence of four factors within the project area. First, Robertson County had a well

INTRODUCTION / 5

established tenancy system during the early twentieth century, a period coinciding with
the agricultural development of Tidwell Prairie. Local informants confirmed that a
tenancy system (sharecropping) was an integral part of the community at that time.
Second, since sharecroppers (and renters) are not usually noted in general land and tax
records, oral history takes on added significance as a means of preserving important
cultural information. Third, existing histories of Robertson County concentrate more on
the early plantation system and on the development of towns than on the lifeways of rural
residents. Fourth, initial fieldwork by both archeologists and historians indicated current
and former residents of Tidwell Prairie would cooperate in an oral history program.
The oral history plan was designed to be comprehensive. That is, it included a balance
of general background and site-specific information. A preference was given to formal
(taped) interviews, where possible, and notes were taken on other occasions. Notes were
also used in instances where the interview was conducted by telephone. In all cases,
efforts were made to locate individuals who had primary information regarding early
twentieth-century lifeways in Tidwell Prairie. Priorities were established, with
preference given to individuals associated with sites under review. Interviews with
secondary subjects were limited primarily to the identification of possible interviewees.
Map collections at The University ofTexas, the Barker Texas History Center, the Texas
Historical Commission, and the General Land Office were reviewed for specific data on
Robertson County. The earliest maps were located in the Archives and Records Division
of the General Land Office.
Individual maps were used primarily to complement original land grant information
and to substantiate the post-Reconstruction development of Tidwell Prairie. A 1936 state
highway map of Robertson County, for example, provided important background infor­
mation on roads in the area during the time of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New
Deal, a period in which many of them were first improved and realigned. Although the
1936 map also indicates the general location of structures, it lacks accuracy regarding the
siting, alignment, usage, or configuration of the buildings. Where feasible, the map was
reviewed by local informants for information on specific families and structures.
Archeological and Architectural Methods, 41RT260
The Austin firm of Volz and Associates conducted the architectural documentation
of the Weaver-Rushing farmstead. Field work and subsequent drafting by John Volz and
Ralph Edward Newlan resulted in a set of HABS-quality drawings for the site. The work
also included extensive field notes, an overall site plan, and details of several architec­
tural elements. Large-format black-and-white photographs of the site, including both
exterior and interior views of the Weaver-Rushing house, were taken by Daniel Julien,
archeologist for TARL. Additional documentation included 35 mm color slides and
black-and-white photographs of outbuildings, landscaping, and selected artifacts.
Following the mitigation plan approved by the Texas Historical Commission, 77 shovel
probes and a 1m2 test unit were excavated at 41RT260. Data recovery was conducted

6 / TIDWELL PRAIRIE

throughout the complex, especially around the house, in the area believed to be the site
of the Rushing store, and in other areas determined on site by the field crew.
Field Methods Employed at Tested Sites

Five of the six historic sites whose NRHP eligibility was under consideration were
assessed using a combination of archival research, oral histories, detailed mapping,
surface collection, gridded test excavations, and photography of standing structures. The
sixth, 41Rf254, the Ed Okonski Site, is privately owned and occupied, so test excavations
were omitted from the evaluation process.
'lYpically, a grid baseline was established with transit and 50 meter tape. Grid
orientation was either magnetic north or based on house orientation. Shovel probes were
spaced at regular intervals (e.g. 5 meters) and increments thereof. Probes at each site
began with #: 1 and were numbered consecutively. Average probe diameter was 30 cms
and all matrix was screened through 1/4-inch mesh. Notes were kept regarding different
soil matrices, actual depth of artifacts recovered, and types of artifacts found. In areas
with the potential for subsurface features or dense diagnostic artifact deposits, a 1 m2
test unit was excavated in 20 cm levels.
In addition, all tested sites were surface collected and special samples were taken from
dump areas. All sites were mapped, in feet, with transit and stadia. Color slides and 35
mm black-and-white prints were taken of structures and features on site. Large-format
photographs were used to document standing structures.
Field work was conducted between February 27 and Apri114 by Karl Kleinbach, Bill
Chandler, and Joe Sanchez under the supervision of Gemma Meha1chick, who
contributed the written account of the archeological findings. The specific treatment of
each site is described in Section III. Anne A. Fox analyzed the artifacts, their distribution
and comparative patterns, and wrote the related sections of this report.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
THE HISTORY OF ROBERTSON COUNTY

During the early Spanish colonial era of Texas history, the Robertson County area was
part of a region traversed more than explored. Entradas through the region began as a
result of Spanish efforts to establish a mission system in Texas. Although later surpassed
by commercial and military considerations, religion provided the initial impetus for
Spanish activity in the territory. Historian William Edward Dunn noted:
However one may question the relative importance of religious zeal as a
factor in the general determination of Spanish Colonial policy, there can
be little doubt that the first definite steps taken by the viceregal government
for the occupation of Texas were inspired largely by genuinely pious
considerations (Castaneda 1976:342-343).
The earliest missionary efforts in Texas began in the late seventeenth century. The
area that includes present Robertson County was strategically located between the
proposed frontier missions in East Texas and the established Spanish settlements in
Mexico. In 1691, Domingo Teran de los Rios crossed the area while opening a supply
route to the missions. What was later known as the Old San Antonio Road became one
of the principal arteries of early trade and migration in Texas. It crossed Robertson
County near Hearne in a route now roughly followed by State Highway 21.
The initial mission experiment failed, but Teran's road remained the primary source
of Spanish influence in the Robertson County area into the early eighteenth century.
Louis Juchereau de St. Denis followed the route in 1714 when he opened trade between
Natchitoches, in French Louisiana, and Spanish settlements along the Rio Grande. Two
years later, the French trader joined forces with the Spanish government to serve as a
guide for the expedition of Captain Jose Domingo Ramon. The party's commission
included a two-fold objective: to reestablish missions in East Texas and to check possible
French influence in the area. Leaving Saltillo early in 1716, the expedition crossed
present Robertson County by June. Their route took them across the northern part of
the county, in the general vicinity of the project area (Castaneda 1936:52-54).
When the East Texas missions were finally abandoned, the Spanish government called
for the institutions to be relocated nearer the interior of Texas. Evacuation took place
over the same general route established earlier by Teran. While San Antonio soon
became the new center of mission activity, three missions were located along the San
Xavier (San Gabriel) River in present Milam County. They were: San Francisco Xavier
de Horcasitas (1746-1748); Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria (1749); and San Ildefonso
(1749). The missions served such Indian groups as the Rancheria Grande, Mayeye,
Yojuane, and Deadose, groups primarily from the region between the Trinity and
Colorado rivers. Missionary activities probably involved travels into areas surrounding

7

8 I TIDWELL PRAIRIE

the institutions, including possibly present Robertson County. The San Xavier missions,
like those in East Texas, were short-lived. Internal dissension, disease, insufficient
governmental support, and other factors contributed to their decline, and they were
abandoned by 1755 (Bolton 1962:178-240).
In the nineteenth century, present Robertson County was included in a colonial grant
administered by empresario Sterling Clack Robertson. Following the earlier success of
Stephen F. Austin, the Texas Company of Davidson County, Tennessee proposed the
settlement of eight hundred families in an area north of Austin's colony and the Old San
Antonio Road. After initial setbacks in leadership, Robertson became empresario in
1830, representing the interests of the Nashville Company, successor to the original firm.
A capable leader, he tried to salvage the operation despite critical contractual limitations.
He also faced legal difficulties, including abrogation of the colonial contract under the
law of April 6, 1830, and subsequent disputes with Stephen F. Austin and Samuel May
Williams. Most of the difficulties were worked out by the mid-1830s, and Robertson then
began an intensive colonization effort.
Nashville-on-the-Brazos in Milam County eventually served as the headquarters for
Robertson's colony. Most of the pioneer settlers came from the United States, principal­
ly the states of the South. Records for the period from December 1835 through early
March 1836 show 128 settlers joined the colony. The number included:
. . . 67 from Tennessee, 17 from Mississippi, 13 from Alabama, 8 from
Illinois, 9 from Missouri, 2 each from Louisiana and New York, 5 from
Maryland, 1 each from Florida, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania and
Kentucky (Henderson 1924:79).
They came to the area over three major routes: up the Brazos River via New Orleans and
the coast; west along the Old San Antonio Road; and south along Trammel's Trace to the
Old San Antonio Road (Tyler 1936:5-8).
By 1837, the Congress of the Republic ofTexas determined there were enough settlers
in eastern Milam County to warrant creation of a new county named in honor of Sterling
Clack Robertson. There were later changes to the original boundaries, but the present
lines were set by 1846. The town of Franklin, now Old Franklin, served as the first seat
of government. Later, Wheelock, Owensville, and Calvert each served temporarily as
the county seat. It was not until 1880 that the present town of Franklin, which was earlier
known as Morgan, became the permanent location for county records (Webb 1952:489).
Robertson County developed on an economic foundation of agriculture. Develop­
ment initially centered around the plantation system in the fertile Brazos River valley.
Later, as a result of the plantations' demise, the introduction of new agricultural prac­
tices, and the construction of rail lines, the population shifted to the upland areas. As a
result, the important towns became Hearne, Calvert, Bremond, and Franklin.

INTRODUCTION / 9

THE HISTORY OF TIDWELL PRAIRIE
Tidwell Prairie is a dispersed agricultural community east of Hammond, in
northwestern Robertson County. It is located on an upland divide between the Brazos
and Navasota rivers. Despite the early growth of Robertson County, the area around
Tidwell Prairie remained an unbroken wilderness until after the Civil War. Although
much of it later became productive farmland, it could not rival the lure of the rich Brazos
valley bottomlands during the antebellum period.
During the republic era, the central area of Robertson County was still considered
the frontier. An 1839 map of the county in the Records and Archives Division of the
General Land Office includes handwritten notations that the interior was a land of "rich
muskeet prairies ... good water, and hostile Indians" (General Land Office map collec­
tion 1839).
It was as a result of a confrontation between early settlers and Indians that Tidwell
Prairie was named. Indians attacked and killed pioneer J. M. Tidwell in 1839, while he
was plowing a field near his home between Calvert and Old Franklin, now a ghost town.
The location of his farm was along Mud Creek, approximately ten miles east of Calvert;
he never lived on the prairie that was later named in his honor (Baker 1970).
Soon after the end of the Texas Revolution in 1836, Robertson County became one of
the first political subdivisions of the new republic. The government began issuing grants
of land to promote settlement in the area. The Tidwell Prairie area was included in
parcels awarded to four Texas pioneers or their families. They were: Thomas H. Brennan,
who came to Texas in 1832 and participated in the early disturbances at Anahuac; the
heirs of L. M. Simons, who was in Texas prior to August 1836; John Trudoe, who settled
in Milam County before the revolution; and George A. Skillern (Skelleron), who died in
1837. The grants remained intact until the 1870s, when completion of a Houston and
Texas Central rail line to Bremond opened the area for settlement (General Land Office
ms.).
Another factor contributing to the opening of the Tidwell Prairie area was the decline
of Owensville, an earlier community in Robertson County. The county seat prior to the
Civil War, it was soon overshadowed by the growth of Calvert, which became the seat of
government in 1870. The change assured Owensville's decline, and residents began
moving from the community to other areas, including the newly opened upland tracts.
Migration to Robertson County increased dramatically during the decade of the
1870s. Spurred by available land and by more promising economic conditions, many
settlers left the war-ravaged areas of the Old South for the farmlands around Bremond,
Calvert, Hearne, and Franklin. They accounted for the majority of the 220% increase in
the population during the ten-year period from 1870 to 1880 (St. Clair 1931:184).
Among those who came from the South and settled around Tidwell Prairie were the
Weavers, Stephensons, and Rushings. They were soon joined by Polish immigrants who
learned of the area from pioneer settlers Joseph and Catherine Bartula. Joseph Bartula
(d. 1919), a native of Austrian Poland, provided the following account of his migration:

10 I TIDWELL PRAIRIE

As a cart-wright I left my hometown in Pilzenski Galacia in 1873, and
together with wife and five children, Chester, Bruno, Stanley, Lige, and
Mathew, sailed for America, landing in Galveston we preceeded (sic) to
New Waverly, whence two years later we came to Bremond to settle
permanently. In the course of the trip I lost two sons, Chester and Bruno,
who were buried in Montgomery County, and all the possessions I had
(Texas Historical Commission marker files).
Bartula's statement has been used in other sources, and, although there are minor
discrepancies in translations, such as the number of sons who died during the journey, it
remains an accurate record of what cultural historians call a "second wave" of settlement.
It was not unusual for immigrants to reside with friends and relatives who preceded them
before moving on to other areas. In Texas, this accounts for the predominant east to west
settlement pattern.
The migration of the Bartulas, and of other Poles who joined them in Robertson
County, differed in many ways from that of earlier Polish-Texans. Prior to the Civil War,
Polish migration to Texas centered around the community of Panna Maria, in Karnes
County. The Poles who settled there came from the province of Upper Silesia. They
came fleeing unreasonable conscription laws and the economic and political hardships
of their homeland. A characteristic of the early Polish settlements in Texas was the lack
of cultural diversity; they were comprised almost entirely of Silesians. Migration from
Upper Silesia continued until the middle-1850s, when Texas experienced a devastative
drought. At the same time, economic conditions were improving in Upper Silesia and
many Poles who had been considering a move to Texas remained to pursue new oppor­
tunities in the nation's developing industries. Those who did choose Texas soon found
their plans interrupted by the American Civil War. Historian T. Lindsay Baker, a
chronicler of the Polish-Texans, notes: ''Although a few individual Poles continued to
come from Upper Silesia after 1856, that date generally marks the close of Silesian Polish
immigration to Texas" (Baker 1975:5).
In contrast, the Poles of Robertson County came after the Civil War, primarily for
economic opportunities, and represented various regions of Poland. Their center of
migration in Texas was the town of New Waverly. Writing about the Walker County town,
Baker observed that it:
served as the mother colony for most of the Polish colonies later established
in east Texas. Although it was located in the Trinity River basin, the other
colonies were in the Brazos River valley, most of them in the rich
bottomland which was ideal for growing cotton (Baker 1982:63).
Bremond eventually surpassed both New Waverly and Panna Maria as the largest
Polish community in the state. A Polish journalist, visiting the town in the early twentieth
century, noted: "I am in the capital of Texas Polonia" (Baker 1982:67).
In contrast with Panna Maria, the Bremond area exhibits fewer visible signs of the
Polish heritage. The influence is still evident in family names and in the activities of the
local Catholic church, but the architecture, language, agricultural practices, and social
customs of the Poles in Robertson County have been largely acculturated. The trend may

change somewhat, however, as a result ofrecent community efforts by Polish descendants
to revive their rich heritage through celebrations and special cultural events.
Blacks represented a third significant group of early settlers in Tidwell Prairie. Many
of the first were freedmen displaced from the Brazos valley following emancipation and
the end of the Civil War. They remained in farming, however, and became instrumental
in the sharecropping system that filled the void left by the breakup of the antebellum
plantation system. Generally, the Blacks remained in small farming enclaves, centered
primarily around their separate churches and schools. Two schools, Giddings Chapel and
Willow Point, served the early Black residents of Tidwell Prairie.
By the early 1880s, there were sufficient numbers of settlers in the Tidwell Prairie
area to constitute a distinct community with a mill, store, school, and church. Together,
these institutions defined the center of the farming settlement. Located adjacent to them
was the Weaver-Rushing house (41RT260), owned by Jack Weaver and later Artie
Rushing, both important leaders of the community.
Tidwell Prairie never became a town, but it served a vital role as the center of a
widespread agricultural region. The economy was not diversified, however, and the fate
of the settlement was tied directly to the future of cotton production and the concomitant
tenancy system. The decades of the 1930s and the 1940s proved to be pivotal times for
lifeways in Tidwell Prairie. The economic depression and ensuing world war changed
forever the composition of the community, primarily through changes in agriculture that
were felt throughout the United States. Labor-intensive tenant farming soon gave way
to more mechanical methods of production. Fewer people farmed, and those that did
began to diversify their output. Cotton no longer dominated the agricultural economy,
although it remained an important element in Robertson County, even to the present.
New sources of farm income were cattle, hogs, and grains. In Tidwell Prairie, hog
production replaced cotton and was, in turn, replaced by ranching. As a result, much of
the early farmland in the area is now used for pasturage.
With the changes in agricultural practices came a decline in population and a dramatic
decrease in the number of houses. Young people, disillusioned by the harshness of
farming during the depression years, left to seek jobs in the growing towns and developing
industries. The consolidation of the Tidwell Prairie School with the Bremond district in
1949 was symbolic of other changes taking place within the community at the time. Since
those changes took place in the 1930s and 1940s, Tidwell Prairie has gradually declined
as a viable community. Today, the name applies only to a few scattered houses, many of
which are abandoned, and an isolated cemetery.

41RT260, THE WEAVER-RUSHING HOUSE
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The Weaver-Rushing house complex (41RT260) is located near the center of Tidwell
Prairie (Fig. 1). Among the community's earliest settlers was Henry Jackson "Jack"
Weaver (1847-1933), who migrated from Montgomery County, Alabama, with his
brother, John, and his sister, Rena Weaver Rushing, about 1870. Jack Weaver became
the patriarch of a large family that was instrumental in the early development of Tidwell
Prairie. Many of his descendants still live in the area.
The land that Jack Weaver chose for his homestead was originally part of a Republic
of Texas grant to the heirs of L. M. Simons (erroneously shown in some records as
Simmons) in 1845. Within months after receiving the grant, the Simons heirs sold the
property, 1476 acres, to John Welch of Navarro County, Texas. There were subsequent
conveyances of the land between 1846 and the 1870s, each involving owners from outside
Ro bertson County. One owner during that time was D. D. Johnson of St. Lou is, Missouri,
who retained title to the property from 1850 to 1874 (Robertson County Deed
Records:D/446; P/195; P/106). It was during Johnson's ownership that J. C. Roberts of
Robertson County filed a conflicting claim on the land. The matter was finally resolved
in Roberts' favor (Robertson County Deed Records:3/237).
J. C. Roberts was a large landowner who figured prominently in the settlement of
northwestern Robertson County. One of his early farm tenants was Joseph Bartula, a
native of Poland. Bartula, with the support and encouragement of Roberts, influenced
other Poles to settle in the area around Tidwell Prairie and Bremond. As a result of their
efforts, Bremond eventually became the nucleus of one of the state's largest Polish
communities.
J. C. Roberts and T. C. Moore jointly owned several large tracts of land in Robertson
County, including the Simons grant, which they partitioned in 1872. The McGlaun
brothers took advantage of the subdivision and purchased 126 acres of the southwest
corner of the Simons tract. In 1885, they further partitioned the land and sold 76 acres
to Weaver. The rise in the per-acre price, from $5 in 1873 to $7 in 1885, indicates that if
any improvements were made to the property during the McGlauns' ownership, they were
minor. More probable is that the price increase reflects the McGlauns' success as land
speculators. They were, in fact, owners of many other tracts in the county (Robertson
County Deed Records:V/515).
Henry Jackson Weaver probably built the original portion of the present house at
41RT260 soon after he purchased his homestead from the McGlauns in 1885 (Robertson
County Deed Records 15:411). The 1885 construction date is consistent with
architectural detailing on the west side of the structure, a two-room section that probably
served as the Weavers' cabin. The Robertson County Tax Abstracts indicate there was a

15

16 I TIDWELLPRAIRIE

significant increase in the property valuation around 1906 and 1907. The change
coincides with the style of a later addition that included an extension on the east side of
the cabin. The extension, which exhibits characteristics of the Victorian architecture
popular at the time, included a full front gallery with a central gabled entry (Robertson
County Tax Abstracts). Weaver became a prominent landowner, and eventually moved
to Calvert where he established a successful cotton buying operation.
In 1912, Jack Weaver sold his homestead to his nephew, Arthur '~tie" Rushing
(1861-1930) (Robertson County Deed Records:58/443). Not much is known of Rushing's
early life, except that he was born in Alabama and that his widowed mother, Rena Weaver
Rushing, brought him to Texas in the 1870s. His father, Oliver Hazard Perry Rushing,
fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War and was mortally wounded at the battle
of Chickamauga in 1863 (Alsup 1985:10). Artie Rushing's obituary recorded that he lived
in the Tidwell Prairie community for 40 years and that for 36 of those years he ran a
general store. He first operated the business out of his home, but eventually constructed
a separate building to the south of his house. As in most rural communities, the store
served as a center of commerce and as a key institution within the context of the area's
social and cultural makeup. As proprietor of the store, and as an active member of the
local Methodist church, Rushing was regarded as one of the community's leaders. His
many contributions to the quality of life in Tidwell Prairie included donation of land for
the church and a public cemetery (Calvert Tribune, March 27, 1930; Calvert Tribune,
March 31, 1932).
Artie Rushing and his wife Loutishe (1855-1932) had two daughters, Tiva (b. 1896)
and Zeby (b. 1898), both of whom died in infancy (Davis and Utley 1987:106). Following
Artie's death in 1930, Loutishe closed the store and built a new house across the county
road and east of their earlier home. The store was torn down about the same time. Mrs.
Frieda Rains recalled that her father, Paul Rehberg, bought the lumber from the store
and that he built a table of mahogany wood from the counter. The table is still in her
possession (Rains 1986).
When Loutishe died, the Weaver-Rushing home was included in litigation involving
her will. Ownership was not legally established until two years later, when her immediate
heirs received clear title to the land (Robertson County Civil Minutes:ZI156). At the
time the site was recorded in 1985, the house belonged to the Cottingham family but was
leased to Bruno Bienzienski. For some time, it had been used seasonally by local hunters.
ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION

The Weaver-Rushing complex (Fig. 2) was nominated to the National Register of
Historic Places and determined eligible in 1987. Historian David W. Moore described
the farmhouse, the central structure, as a vernacular structure dating from the late
nineteenth century, with a predominance ofearly twentieth-century details and materials.
Since the expansion of the original home in the 1900s, he noted:

the house has remained virtually unaltered and retains its historic integrity
and character to a remarkable degree. Although considered a vernacular
structure, the Weaver-Rushing house displays some finely crafted detailing
that is associated with the Victorian period.
He adds that the out buildings, including the barn, storage shed, outhouse, and chicken
coops, should be considered contributing members of the site (Moore 1987).
The main structure at 41RT260 is a four room frame house that faces southeast, onto
a private road that joins the county road northeast of the property (Fig. 2). Interesting
architectural elements of the Weaver-Rushing house include the 10-bay front porch, the
central gabled roofwith cove and diamond shingling, the turned posts, and the corrugated
tin roof accented by a clover-leaf ridge row and end finials (Figs. 3-5). The windows are
double-hung with four-aver-four lights. On the east and north elevations, the windows
are paired in the style popular during the early twentieth century (Fig. 6).
Essential elements of the farmstead are the various outbuildings (Figs. 2, 7). As
viewed in the context of the intact site, they provide insight into a typical farm operation
in Tidwell Prairie at the turn of the century. Moore's description of the complex notes:
A two-story frame barn stands northwest of the house. With
board-and-batten construction, the barn has a gable roof with a
corrugated-metal covering. A shed extends from the west side of the barn.
Another storage building stands north of the house and it, too, is of
board-and-batten construction. Although its condition is poor, this
structure is still used for storage. A small shed addition extends from the
west side. Other outbuildings include two small chicken coops and an
outhouse. While the exact date of construction is not known, each of the
buildings, including the barn and storage shed, appears to be at least 50
years old because of building materials and form (Moore 1987).
No longer extant, but once an integral part of the complex, is the Rushing general
store. According to local informants, it stood south of the house, parallel to the county
road that runs adjacent to the site. It was a small frame building with a square, parapeted
front that faced the main entry of the house. Pinkie Weaver Towns, a longtime resident
of Tidwell Prairie, described the Rushing store as:
an old-timey mercantile store. They sold practically everything that could
be bought, including groceries, hardware, yard goods, and other
merchandise of every description. They also had the only telephone in the
community for many years (Smart 1985:4).
Also no longer extant is a garage that was located to the west of the store, near a large
oak tree that remains. Ted Yezak, another longtime resident of the community, noted
that Artie Rushing probably owned the first car in Tidwell Prairie. Justifiably proud of
his new machine, he constructed his garage with open sides so it could be seen easily by
the neighbors and area residents (T. Yezak 1989).
Traces of landscaping by early owners are contributing elements of the site. A peach
tree, a red bud tree, and several crepe myrtles are growing in the fenced yard immediately

surrounding the house (Fig. 2). Iris beds line the interior of the front fence which is
marked by remnants of the original pickets now reinforced with bailing wire and wire
fencing. The pickets exhibit jig-sawn detailing typical of the Victorian era. A brick walk
leads from the house to the front gate. A cased well with commercially-made concrete
collar (Davis and Utley 1987:89) is located 25 feet from the southwest corner of the front
porch. Gates in the house yard fence lead to the drive in front of the house and northwest
to the farm yard.
ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

Field Methodology

Mitigation at 41RT260 was carried out as proposed in the plan submitted to the Texas
Historical Commission (TARL 1989b:4-5). Excavation of the site included 77 shovel
tests and a 1m2 test unit. Testing was done throughout the yard surrounding the house,
the northern two-thirds of the farm yard, and in selected contiguous areas outside the
yard (Fig. 8). Shovel tests were 50 cm2, and located along grid baseline oriented
320°/150°, the same as tlie house. Tests were spaced in 5-meter increments and were dug
to sterile soiL All were numbered consecutively as excavated, beginning with # 1. Matrix
was screened through 1/4-inch mesh and notes were taken on standard recording forms
regarding soil matrices, actual depth of artifacts, and artifact types.
In areas of heavy artifact density or where subsurface features occurred, additional
testing was done. One 1m2 unit, Test Unit A, was placed northwest of the house, based
on the high artifact density recovered from shovel testing in that area (Fig. 8). The unit
was excavated in 20 em levels, the matrix was screened, and the aforementioned notes
taken. In addition, an area south of the existing private road, thought to be the location
of the general store, was tested (Fig. 8). The initial testing was done at 5-meter intervals
on the same grid as that used at the house site. A few intermediate units were added to
obtain additional artifactual information on the area. The shovel tests in this area began
with #60 and were numbered consecutively as executed, following the numerical succes­
sion from the house site.
Mitigation of the site also included an inventory of materials stored in the outbuild­
ings (Table 1), a general surface collection of diagnostic artifacts, and transit mapping of
the site and pertinent features in the surrounding area. Large-format photographs were
taken of the house and outbuildings, along with 35 mm color slides and black and white
prints.

Artifact Distribution

Test pits varied from 5 to 38 em in depth and yielded from 0 to as many as 112 artifacts.
In Test Unit A, the first 20 cm level contained 567 artifacts, while the second 20 cm level
was relatively sterile, indicating that the materials were probably discarded on the
surface, rather than being buried in pits. The relatively small amount of bone recovered

JVEA VER~RUSHING HOUSE / 27

throughout the testing (Table 2) indicates that the more odorous forms of garbage were
probably disposed of in a different manner.
Artifacts were found in the inner yard, the outer farm yard, and the area immediately
adjoining them, with several areas of intense concentration (Fig. 9). An accumulation of
artifacts on a high spot across the lane to the south may indicate the general location of
the store.
Distribution of artifacts within the inner yard showed no particular concentration in
relation to egress from the house, contrary to observations in eighteenth century North
Carolina sites (South 1977:47). Jurney and Moir (1987) have studied similar farm sites
in the Richland Creek area near Corsicana, ca. 80 miles north of Tidwell Prairie. There
they found a similar situation in that the inner yard around the house was kept relatively
clean, perhaps implying a "swept" yard or less frequent use of these areas. The more
intense artifact deposits at Richland Creek were often found in horseshoe-like bands 6
to 18 meters (20 to 60 ft) from the house (Jurney and Moir 1987:233). The same situation
was found in mid-nineteenth century farm sites on the lower Frio River in McMullen
County (Fox 1986).
In the case of the Weaver-Rushing house, the artifact distribution appears to have
been limited and/or dictated by access to the house. Since there were no doors on the
back of the house, all traffic to the outer farm yard apparently had to go through the gate
to the east of the house. Trash seems to have been discarded by carrying it out the gate
or by throwing it over the back fence (Fig. 9). Evidence for the latter pattern of disposal
was also found in the small turn-of-the-century town of Wallisville in Chambers County
(Fox, Day, and Highley 1980:112).
The concentration of artifacts in the north and northwest part of the outer yard may
indicate that outdoor activities were primarily carried out in those areas. A smaller
accumulation of artifacts just outside the gate may represent debris from house and yard
cleaning. The area of relatively intense artifact deposition behind the storage shed,
outside the outer yard, may be related to activities carried on in that structure.
ARTIFACT PATTERNING

The artifacts recovered during testing have been separated into eight categories for
purposes of analysis (Table 2). Of these, the Kitchen/Dining and Construction categories
account for the largest percentages of the total (Table 3). This type of organization of
data has been found to be particularly useful for ease of understanding what was happen­
ing on a site, and for purposes of comparison with other sites.
The Kitchen/Dining category contains the largest number of items. The ceramics
total is surprisingly low, accounting for only 2% of the total number of artifacts. The
types represented are primarily undecorated whiteware of varying shades from white
ironstone to cream-colored wares. What little decoration exists is overglaze decal­
comania. Small amounts of stoneware and porcelain are also present. The stoneware
bears a Bristol glaze, which was popular in the South after 1900 (Jurney and Moir
1987:132). By that time, glass containers were taking the place of stoneware for food

storage, which may account for the small number of sherds of stoneware present on this
site.
Bottle glass is by far the most prevalent artifact in the collection. Of this, the large
majority is from clear, machine-made, screw-top bottles and jars made after ca. 1903
(Kendrick 1966:81). A few pieces of bottles with high manganese content which have
turned slightly purple from exposure to sunlight could possibly date to the 1880s
(Kendrick 1966:57). One such example (Fig. lab) also has the hand-finished rim typical
of closed mold construction, which immediately preceded bottle-making machines
(Kendrick 1966:47). Of the few identifiable fragments of drinking glasses present, one
is a pressed glass tumbler base (Fig. lOa). An unusual clear glass object with half-round
shape (Fig. 10c) resembles the water container for a bird cage.
It is evident glass containers were preferred to tin cans at this site, since few thin metal
fragments were recovered. A silver-plated iced tea spoon (Fig. 109) stamped "WR."
(Wm. Rogers) is of a pattern similar to those illustrated in the Sears Roebuck Catalog of
1927 (Mirken 1970:754).

Relatively few household furnishings and personal items are represented in the
collection. One object of interest is a section of the mechanism that held and controlled
the wick on an oil lantern (Fig. 10f). In contrast to this object are the fragments of electric
light bulbs also present. Since electricity did not arrive in the area until the 1940s, these
were comparatively recent artifacts probably associated with sporadic use of the house
by renters and hunters.
Personal items found in the excavations include three buttons, one snap fastener, and
two buckles (Fig. 10e). Such small objects might be more likely to remain where they
fell, and be dropped or overlooked when carrying out trash.

Artifacts that represent the Activities category include two marbles, a porcelain doll
fragment, a shotgun shell, and a fragment of a composition phonograph record. One of
the marbles is made of swirled glass. The other marble is made of clay with a blue glaze.
Blue colored clay marbles were made in Akron, Ohio, and probably elsewhere in the
United States, from ca. 1889 to the early 1900s (Carskadden, Gartley, and Reeb 1985:88).
Under the Barn/Shop/Workshop category, rusted wire and various unidentifiable
hardware and machinery parts are also present in small amounts. Battery core fragments
are particularly noticeable among the artifacts from the area across the road, and may be
related to activities at the store.
Construction is the second largest category of artifacts recovered from this site. Most
of the count is derived, however, from only two types of artifacts: nails and window glass.
The large majority of the nails, as might be expected, are wire nails, which came into Texas
in the 1880s and rapidly replaced cut nails for house construction. Fragments of two types
of brick are also present: a red, well-fired commercially made brick some of which are
labeled "MEXIK', and a crudely made, lower-fired brick that was probably made locally.
Barbed wire and fence staples are also part of the collection.
Included in the Miscellaneous category are objects of various man-made materials
popular after the turn of the century. A clay pigeon fragment represents the hunters who
have used the house since the last full-time occupants moved out. A prehistoric dart
point among the glass, ceramics, and wire nails is an indication that someone in the
household may have collected such objects from the surface of local sites.
Observations on the Weaver-Rushing Site

The layout of the Weaver-Rushing site is interesting in that it is at the same time
typical and atypical of farmsteads in the central Texas area. In comparison with the
observations of Jurney and Moir (1987:234) at similar sites near Corsicana, the relative
arrangement of the outbuildings, and their distance from the house, are typical for the

time period of 1870s to 1920s. At the Weaver-Rushing house, however, the unusual
absence of a "back door" influenced the general configuration of trash accumulation in
the outer farmyard.
The orientation of the house facing the southeast is typical for the nineteenth century.
Crosby (1977:36-37) has observed that it was common practice in early Texas to orient
the front of the house to the south or southeast to take advantage of the prevailing
summer breezes. Rather than facing directly onto the county road, as did a number of
other houses in Tidwell Prairie, this house was turned to face the southeast even though
it necessitated constructing a driveway for access.
It is difficult for us today to imagine how the Weaver family managed to live in a
two-room house for 21 years (ca. 1885 to 1906) while raising seven children (two more
had died before 1883, and another died as an infant in 1885). In 1906-1907, when the
Weavers were finally able to add onto the house, the children left at home would have
included three sons ranging in age from 10 to 20 years and a daughter, 15. By then, the
older children had left home (Alsup 1985).
Considering the number of children present over the years, it is surprising how few
indications there are of their presence in the artifacts recovered. One would never
suspect such a large family to be represented by only two marbles and a porcelain doll.
What toys there were must have been of the home-made variety, made of perishable
materials. The boys would have been expected to help with the farming from the time
they were old enough, while the daughters helped their mother with the work of running
the household. Moments of leisure were probably spent on the front porch. Much of the
household work in the early years would of necessity have been done out of doors, in the
outer yard or on the porch. The inner yard and even the area around the well were kept
relatively clean of artifacts, and do not indicate that household chores were done there.
The preponderance of clear, machine-made glassware in the collection confirms the
fact that the family did not do well financially until after 1900, when the addition to the
house and the landscaping of the yard also reflect better times and perhaps time to spend
"fixing up" the place. Crepe myrtles were planted to the east of the new wing and near
the front gate. The peach and red bud trees behind the house may predate the addition
(see Fig. 2). The picket fence also appears to date to the post-1907 period, although the
trash distribution pattern suggests that it may have replaced another type of fencing in
the same location.
Stanley South (1977) suggests that a predictable pattern of artifact frequencies, which
he has named the Carolina Pattern, exists on eighteenth-century British colonial sites in
the Carolinas. Similar frequencies have been observed in nineteenth century sites of
settlers coming from the southern states into Texas. According to South (1977:Table 11),
the Carolina Pattern displays the following mean percentages:
Kitchen 63.1
Architecture 25.5
Furniture 0.2
Arms 0.5

Clothing 3.0
Personal 0.2
Tobacco Pipes 5.8
Activities

34 I TIDWELL PRAIRIE

The artifacts from the Weaver-Rushing site, while not divided into precisely the same
categories (Table 3), show interesting similarities and differences to the Carolina
Pattern, many of which may be due to changes in customs in 100 years, the effects of
the Industrial Revolution on glassware production, and the introduction of
inexpensive wire nails.
An interesting and unexplainable observation of the results of the testing at the
Weaver-Rushing site is that while the percentage of Kitchen/Dining artifacts is the same
as that of the Carolina Pattern, the ratio of ceramics to glass (South 1977:126 vs. Table
3) is reversed. The general conclusion from these comparisons is that while pattern
studies are useful for comparative purposes, they are neither absolute nor universal in
their application. There are also variables relating to the methods of testing as well as
the comparative age of the sites that are likely to skew the resulting artifact totals. It will
be interesting to continue this type of comparative analysis in studying sites of Polish
background within the Calvert Mine area.

CONCLUSIONS
Site 41RT260 is a rural farm complex located at the center of a widespread agricultural
community known as Tidwell Prairie. The primary structure at the site is a four-room
frame vernacular residence, the Weaver-Rushing house, referred to locally as "the long
house." Other structures include a barn, storage house, chicken coops, and a cased well.
Adding to the integrity of the site are extant landscaping features such as a brick walk,
domestic plantings, and a fence. The complex represents a unique historical element
within the context of Tidwell Prairie, primarily because of architectural embellishments,
the retention of original integral elements, and the paucity of intact sites related to the
community's period of significance. Individuals associated with 41RT260 include two
early community leaders and their families. Full-time historic occupation of the site
generally mirrored the growth and decline of Tidwell Prairie, from the late nineteenth
century to the Great Depression of the 19308.
The archeological, architectural, and historical investigations conducted at the
Weaver-Rushing complex appropriately mitigated the adverse effects proposed for the
property. HABS-quality drawings were prepared by architects, following closely the
recommendations of THC personnel. Originals of the drawings, along with copies of the
mitigation report, photographs, slides, archeological and architectural field notes, and
support documentation, are housed in the National Register Department of the THe. In
addition, copies of the report and the drawings were provided the schools of architecture
at The University of Texas at Austin and at Texas A & M University. Artifacts collected
during the archeological investigations were processed and curated at the TARL, The
University of Texas at Austin.

ELIGIBILITY TESTING OF SIX HISTORIC SITES
41RT251: GORSKI-YEZAK HOMESITE

Site Description

Site 41Rf251 is situated near the middle of the broad, rolling upland divide which
separates Bee Branch and Big Willow Creek (Fig. 1). It consists of a group of partially­
collapsed outbuildings and a relatively low area where a house once stood. The house
site is now marked by a few wooden piers and scattered artifacts, mostly broken glass and
fragments of handmade brick. A concrete-cased well is located southeast of the house
site (Fig. lla).
The remains of a gabled roof southeast of the well cover lumber salvaged after a storm
destroyed the house. Wire fences once outlined the house yard (Fig. lIb) and a perimeter
fence surrounds much of the main farmstead. There is a corral at the northeast corner
of the area and an enclosure to the north and northwest of the house site. A stock pond
central to the livestock area may not have been part of the original layout of the farmyard,
but a later addition after the house was no longer occupied. A trash dump north of the
farmstead trails down the bank of an unnamed creek.
Historical Background

The 52-acre tract is in the southwest corner of the George W. Skillern (also shown as
Skelleron) survey, awarded by the State of Texas in 1849. Nine years later, the probate
court of Washington County ordered the half-league sold as part of the settlement of
Skillern's estate. As a result, the administrator, Fayette County resident William P.
Smith, conveyed the land to J. B. Chance (Robertson County Deed Records:Q/37-38).
J. B. Chance died before 1868, when his heirs sold to Andrew Parker for a dollar an
acre. Both the heirs and Parker are shown as residents of Burleson County. Parker was
living in Washington County by 1875, however, when he deeded the Skillern tract to
Gabriel Jackson of Burleson County. Jackson died two years later, and, in 1884, his
executor conveyed 1351 acres to J. S. McLendon and J. A. Foster, the first Robertson
County owners of the property (Robertson County Deed Records:Q/39; 22/145; Z/269;
13/347).
The Calvert firm of J. S. McLendon and Company surveyed the Skillern half-league
and subdivided it for resale as small farms. The company's principal, Jesse Sumpter
McLendon, was a prominent business leader in Robertson County. Prior to the Civil War,
he owned a mercantile in the settlement of Sterling (now a ghost town), west of Calvert,
where he met his later business partner Joseph A. Foster. McLendon and Foster even­

37

ELIGIBILI1YTESTING I 39

tually moved to the more promising town of Calvert. There, McLendon developed his
financial interests, establishing the city's First National Bank in 1890 (Baker 1970:44
443 and 484).
J. S. McLendon and Company sold two blocks of the subdivided Skillern tract to
Albert Storemski (also shown as Steremski, Sturempski, and Sterumpski) in 1889. Albert
(1846-1922) and his wife Francis (Franciska) (1851-1946) retained ownership of the land
until 1908, when they partitioned 52 acres for sale to Frank Gorski (1887-1954). The
property was not the Storemskis' homesite, although they had made improvements to the
land that included the construction of fences (Floyd and Corn 1980:45-66; Robertson
County Deed Records:23/148; 501535; and 153/381).
The structures at 41RT251 were built during the ownership of Frank Gorski. In a 1911
oil, gas, and mineral lease, he granted exploration rights, retaining the right of tillage on
the 52 acres. No mention was made of buildings at the time (Robertson County Mineral
Lease Records:59/636). In a 1949 affidavit, however, Gorski and his neighbor, Bruno
Okonski, affirmed their knowledge of the farmstead. They noted that Gorski's ownership
had included maintenance of "houses, barns, gardens, outhouses, and other improve­
ments on said tract of land... " (Robertson County Deed Records: 153/381).
In 1945, Frank and Marcella (Minnie) Gorski sold their farm to Fred Pietrowicz. A
single man, Pietrowicz owned the property for only four years, selling in 1949 to Reece
and Josephine Yezak (Robertson County Deed Records: 136/592; 154/584). Yezak family
members were among the earliest Polish settlers in Robertson County. Naturalization
papers on several individuals indicate the family came from Prussian Poland in the 1870s
and 1880s and that the family name was probably anglicized from the original spelling,
Jerzack (Robertson County Naturalization Records).
Reece Yezak lived in the house at 41RT251 while he farmed the surrounding land.
He had relocated his family by 1981, however, when a tornado destroyed most of the
structures on the property. Yezak later cleared the site of much structural debris. He
salvaged some reusable lumber and stored it under a gabled rooftop that was a remnant
of his garage (R. Yezak 1989).
The storm also damaged other structures on the site. In addition to the remains of a
small board-and-batten shed, a collapsed log crib is located north of the house mound.
Made of small, unpeeled logs joined by corner saddle notching, it was used for agricul­
tural storage. The method of construction is typical of other "temporary" log buildings
erected in the area during the 1920s and 1930s. Rusted farm implements, since removed,
were located nearby when first observed in 1986.
Testing

Test excavations on the site consisted of 76 shovel probes. The grid was aligned with
the county road and the general pattern of the fences. The house was probably also
aligned with the original fencelines, as was the custom. The front of the house apparently
faced southeast, judging from its general proportions and the layout of the inner yard.

40 I TIDWELLPRAIRIE

The shovel probes were excavated through brown loamy sand overlying yellowish­
brown sand into a mottled clay B horizon at approximately 35 to 40 cm. The majority of
the artifacts were found in the brown layer at depths of 0 to 15 cm below the surface. The
exception was in areas of more intense deposition to the east of the house where they
occasionally extended to 20 cm.
Artifact Distribution

Test probes varied from 5 to 42 em in depth and yielded from 0 to as many as 19
artifacts (Fig. 12), with a total recovery of 262 artifacts. No deep concentrations indicat­
ing buried trash pits were encountered. The dump on the bank of the creek to the north
may indicate why there is such a scarcity of surface artifact scatter around the house and
yard area.
A slightly higher count of artifacts directly behind the house may signify the presence
of a back door in that location. The peculiar pattern of artifact distribution is different
than that on other sites in the area of the same background and time period. This may
be partially a product of the layout of the farmstead, the fence behind being for some
reason a barrier to deposition in that direction. A slightly higher count directly out the
front door toward the farm road may indicate the path rubbish was carried to the dump.
A similar distribution has been noted on farmsteads in the Hill Country where the dump
can be found following the trail of glass, ceramic, and metal items down a farm road.
Artifact Discussion

Of the seven categories into which artifacts were divided for analysis (Table 4), the
Kitchen/Dining category is the largest. Recovered ceramics include undecorated
whiteware, of which one sherd (Fig. 13a) represents a plate with a green glaze on both
sides. Whitewares with similar pastel-colored glazes were made by American potteries
after the turn of the century and were the forerunners of the popular Fiesta pattern
produced by the Homer Laughlin Company in the mid-1930s (Ketchum 1983:185-187).
A few representative sherds of Bristol-glazed stoneware (Fig. 13f), porcelain. and yellow
kitchenware were also recovered. The small number of sherds produced by the shovel
probes allows few observations about the use of ceramics by the occupants except that
the assortment is typical of those found on the sites in this project.
Within the Kitchen/Dining group, bottle glass rates 10 to lover ceramics in number
of sherds recovered. By far the majority of the glass is from clear, machine-made,
screw-top containers, many of them canning jars. Whole jars recovered from the house
site and the dump are as follows:

A hole-in-top evaporated milk can was also recovered from the dump. It had been
opened by punching two holes in one end with a knife blade tip.
A clothes pin spring (post-1940), a fragment of a light bulb base, and a piece of a
pressed glass object were the only Household Furnishings recovered. The fact that the
spring was found across the fence to the north of the house may indicate that a clothesline
was there.
A single translucent red plastic button is the only Personal or Clothing object in the
collection. A 22 cal. cartridge case and a Winchester Nublack No. 11 shotgun shell are
the only articles classified as Activities. Miscellaneous items that would have been used
in a Barn/Workshop setting include a section of a saw blade (Fig. 14d) and a fragment of
a battery core.
The Construction category artifacts are the second most numerous group. As usual,
wire nails and window glass make up the largest percentage. Also present in significant
numbers are small fragments of asphalt shingles, a good chronological indication of the
age of at least one roofing episode, since such shingles were not in use until the late 1930s
or early 1940s (Rader 1939:501).
Observations
The relative percentages of the various artifact categories (Table 5) are somewhat
different at 41RT251 than at 41RT260. This may be a result of the unusually low total
number of artifacts recovered, indicating that such a small sample is not useful for such
comparative studies. The reason for the scarcity of artifacts in the vicinity of this
farmstead is difficult to understand. This situation was first observed on most of the
historic sites during the initial survey and was thought to indicate "a cultural propensity
toward thrift and neatness" (Davis and Utley 1987:104). Later scavenging for useful
objects and materials may also have played a role by reducing the amount of artifacts on
the surface. In any case, 262 artifacts are an inadequate sample for formulating important
conclusions about the occupation of the site. The combination of the dates of canning
jars, the clothes pin spring, and the roof shingles would seem to indicate that the house
continued in active use until the early 1940s.

41RT252: BRUNO OKONSKI HOMESITE
Site Description

This historic site is located near the crest of the upland divide separating Bee Branch
and Big Willow Creek (Fig. 1). It was recorded on the basis of a mounded area sur­
rounded by in situ sandstone blocks where a frame house once stood. There is also an
outline on the ground where an outbuilding was probably located, as well as two fence
posts that may have supported a gate.
The site slopes downward from east to west. A contemporary ranch road runs
diagonally through the northern section of the site. A metal cistern is just west of the
house, and approximately 120 meters farther to the west are a dry stock tank, a cement­
lined well, and a corral.
The cistern projects 2 feet 3.S inches above the present ground surface and measures
4 feet 5 inches across (Fig. 15). A one-inch metal rim surrounds the top. The sides are
made with three or more metal sections riveted together, and the interior is lined with a
black tar-like substance. The actual inside depth of the cistern is estimated to be 6 feet
10.5 inches, and it is set into a concrete base. The letters "S" and 'W' have been hand
painted on the outside of the cistern. Faded and nearly undecipherable letters stenciled
on the outside of the cistern include the following words: "TRADE", "GALVANIZED",
"PATENT", "CISTERNS", "SCREENED", and "TEXAS".
Historical Background

Initially, it was believed the home at 41RT252 might date to the late nineteenth
century, the presumption being based on oral history information. Subsequent research

- - - - - _.......

_-­

ELIGIBILITY TESTING / 47

FIGURE 15. Metal cistern west of house site at 41RT252.
has provided greater detail about the site, and it now appears the house dates only to the
second decade of the twentieth century.
The property was part of the L. M. Simons grant awarded by the Republic of Texas in
1845 (see 41RT260). During Reconstruction, partners T. C. Moore and J. C. Roberts
began dividing their large landholdings, which included the 1476-acre Simons tract.
Further subdividing his share, T. C. Moore sold 100 acres to Albert Storemski in 1883 for
just over two dollars an acre. In 1920, Albert Storemski and his wife Francis conveyed
three tracts of land to their son, Steve. The transaction included the current 50-acre tract
(Robertson County Deed Records: 11/493; 72/419).
There are two separate indications that Steve Storemski made considerable improve­
ments to the land, including the construction of a home and probably associated
agricultural buildings and fences as well. First, the valuation of Storemski's land showed
a sizeable increase during his ownership. In August 1929, he sold 113 acres, including
the 50-acre homesite, for almost $30 per acre (Robertson County Deed Records:95/587).
Second, a 1988 affidavit, filed in Robertson County to provide a record of subsequent
land ownership, noted that in the late 1920s, "Steve Storemski and his wife sold ... the
land and moved off" (Mikolajewski 1988).
The new owners of the land at 41RT252 were Joe and Victoria Okonski (Robertson
County Deed Records:95/587). They did not live on the property; however (see
41RT254), it was occupied from the time of their purchase until the 1950s by their son
Bruno John Okonski and his wife, also named Victoria. The 1988 affidavit states that
Bruno and Victoria Okonski took possession in 1929 and farmed the land, planting cotton
and corn (Mikolajewski 1988). Clear title to the land came in the 1940s, after the deaths
of Joe Okonski (d. 1945) and his wife Victoria (d. 1944) (Majewski 1945).

48 I TIDWELLPRAIRIE

In 1956, Bruno and Victoria Okonski moved to Harris County and their land was, like
many other farmsteads in Tidwell Prairie, converted to pasturage. Antone Mikolajewski
stated in his 1988 affidavit: "That they (the Okonskis) partially cleared the land, mowed
and fertilized the same. That there are no buildings to speak of on the property, but there
are several ponds that generally hold water" (Mikolajewski 1988). Since the Okonskis
moved off the site, the land has been leased for grazing purposes, first to William
Kimpinski and then to Victoria's son-in-law A. J. Mushinski (Mikolajewski 1988). The
farmhouse was moved to Bremond, where it was extensively remodeled (Okonski 1989).
Testing
Test excavations consisted of 97 shovel probes (Fig. 16). The grid was aligned to the
compass points, since no structures were left above ground to use as guides to the
orientation of the buildings. The probes were dug to an average of 15 to 25 cm below the
surface, with the maximum depth at 45 cm. Soils were brown loamy sand overlying
yellowish-brown sand above the mottled red and yellow clay of the B horizon. The
yellowish-brown sand is sterile. In one probe at a lower location of the site, a gray clay
was encountered which was interspersed with yellowish-brown sand. In another probe,
a compacted gray sand was found at 17 to 21 cm. In areas of greatest artifact concentra­
tion to the northwest and northeast of the house mound, the brown loamy sand is
approximately 30 cm deep.
Unit A, a 1 m2 , was excavated in a slightly mounded area to the northwest ofthe house
site, where shovel testing exposed a trash concentration. Artifacts were found from the
surface to 35 cm below, and consisted of nails, decorated and undecorated whiteware,
stoneware, cartridges, brick fragments, bottle glass, a canning jar lid liner, and a copper
buckle. Levell (0-20 cm) yielded 238 artifacts and Level 2 (20-34 cm) yielded 29, for a
total of 267 artifacts, or 40% of the number of artifacts recovered from the site. Actually,
therefore, the 97 probes produced 337 artifacts, a comparatively small total to have come
from that many test probes, but similar to results from the other tested sites.
Artifact Distribution
Test probes yielded from 0 to 36 artifacts (Fig. 16), with a total count from the site of
604 artifacts. Their distribution is similar to that of other farmstead sites throughout the
area, with the main concentration distant from the former site, leaving a clear area in its
immediate vicinity. In this case, the main trash accumulations are north and northwest
of the house mound. This suggests that the house faced southeast, placing the major
debris dump in the backyard and lesser concentrations in the side yard. This distribution
is similar to that found by Jurney and Moir (1987:233) at Richland Creek. The one probe
with a relatively high concentration yielded predominantly window glass fragments and
probably has little relationship to ordinary trash disposal practices at the site. The route
of the present ranch road, through an area of artifact concentration in what would have
been the backyard of the house, strongly suggests that the road postdates the demolition
of the farmstead.

Artifact Discussion

The ceramic collection at this site consists of a number of different types of overglaze
decorated whitewares (Fig. 13b), including painted designs, a brown-banded variety (Fig.
13e), one with a gold rim band, and several types of decal designs (Fig. 13c). The balance
of the whitewares are about evenly divided between ironstone and plain whitewares. One
porcelain sherd bears an interesting molded design.
As on the other sites, the bottle glass is predominantly from clear, machine·made

bottles. Bottle caps were nearly all crown caps from soda bottles. One bottle base was
manufactured at Owens Illinois Glass Co., Toledo Ohio (Fig. 13a). An interesting and
unusual glass fragment is from a cut glass salt dish (Fig. 13h). By the time this house was
occupied, such an item would have been a family heirloom or a piece purchased from an
antique shop.
The only button recovered is a metal "gripper" type fastener (Fig. 14c). A brass
clothing hook, a buckle (Fig. 14a), a leather shoe heel, and a tooth from a composition
comb are the personal items in the collection. Several shotgun shells were found in Unit
~ but no toys or indications of other activities are present.
The usual assortment of wire fragments, metal stripping, and other small iron frag­
ments represent the machinery and other workshop operations on the farm. The
Construction category (Table 6) includes window glass, both cut and wire nails, fragments
of the same handmade local brick found at 41RT251, and the usual barbed wire and fence
staples, indicating that the yard and surrounding farmstead were undoubtedly fenced in
a manner similar to other farms in this area. The presence of cut nails could indicate a
conservative mindset on the part of the builder, or possibly the reuse of lumber from
older structures that had been demolished, a common habit of late·nineteenth·century
Texas builders and present-day residents of Tidwell Prairie.
Observations

The artifact percentages (Table 7) at this site are similar to those observed at the
majority of the other sites. The Kitchen/Dining category accounted for over 70% of the
total and Construction and Barn/Workshop categories represented 25%. This may simply
be due to the fact that there is a larger sample from this site. It is interesting that the
artifact distribution suggests that the house faced the southeast and that the present road
is probably not in its original location, demonstrating that artifact distribution mapping
can have a number of uses beyond that of locating artifact concentrations.

41RT254: ED OKONSKI FARMSTEAD

Site Description
Currently owned and administered by the Okonski family, 41RT254 is an intact
farmstead situated near the eastern edge of the broad, rolling upland divide which
separates Bee Branch and Big Willow Creek (Fig. 17). The site consists of a board-and­
batten house that fronts onto a county road (Fig. 18a). Agricultural structures include a
barn (Fig. 18b), a chicken coop, several storage buildings, sheds, and corrals. Fences
outline the immediate house yard as well as the surrounding farmyard. All of the
buildings on the property are still functional, with the exception of a collapsed hay barn
northeast of the house and outside the fenced farmyard. Other important features
include a stock tank in a field adjacent to the farmstead on the east side, and a large
garden area northeast of the house.
Historical Background
The land was originally part of a 1476-acre tract granted to the heirs of George A.
Skillern (d. 1837) in 1849. Subsequent owners through Reconstruction were
out-of-county residents or land speculators (Robertson County Deed Records:Q/38-39;
Z/269; 22/145; and 13/347).
In 1884, the land was purchased by J. S. McLendon and J. A. Foster, prominent
landowners in Robertson County. They commissioned a survey of the Skillern tract and
began selling the property in blocks. In 1889, the Calvert firm of J. S. McLendon and
Company conveyed two 93-acre blocks to Albert Storemski (see 41RT252). Ten years
later, Albert and his wife Francis further subdivided their holdings and deeded 54 acres

to their daughter Victoria, wife of Joe Okonski (Robertson County Deed Records: 13/347;
23/148; and 40/604).
Joe Okonski, like Albert Storemski, was a native of Poland. His naturalization papers
indicate he was born in Polish Germany in 1871 and that he emigrated to the United
States the same year with his family entering at New York City. The family probably
followed the general pattern of Polish migration to Texas after the Civil War, settling
temporarily in the mother colony at New Waverly before moving on to the Bremond area
of Robertson County (Robertson County Naturalization Records).
According to Ed Okonski, the son of Joe and Victoria Okonski, his parents built their
home on the 54-acre tract around the time they acquired it in 1899. The first house on
the site was a two-room cabin that now forms the rear ell of the present house. Aligned
and constructed in a manner typical of early houses in the Tidwell Prairie area, the ell
has a full galleried porch that faces southeast. A shed addition extends across the rear
of the ell (Okonski 1986).
The front, and more detailed, section of the present house dates to 1917-1918,
according to Ed Okonski. The time period would be consistent with architectural details,
including turned posts, spindled porch ornamentation, and vertical window treatments,
that reflect late Victorian influences. Other houses in the Tidwell Prairie area exhibit
varying degrees of Victorian influence, although none match the state of preservation at
41RT254.
Early outbuildings on the Okonski farmstead include storage sheds, a chicken coop,
and a barn. The latter is constructed of logs joined by simple saddle corner notching. In
addition to the wooden structures built during Joe Okonski's ownership, there are metal
and frame storage buildings added since the 1940s.
Victoria Okonski died in 1944 and Joe Okonski died the following year. The family
farmstead was eventually acquired by their son Ed L. Okonski. An affidavit concerning
Ed Okonski's ownership provides the following information about the historical use of
the land:
Ed Okonski bought this land back in the mid 1940's when it was being
used for growing crops such as corn, cotton, tomatoes, melons and other
types of vegetables and agricultural products for sale. The land was also
used for raising livestock such as cattle and hogs, poultry such as turkeys,
chickens and geese, and the growing and harvesting of various fruits such
as peaches, plums, pecans, grapes, melons and berries. During the 1950's
and 60's, the land was primarily used for raising cattle and growing fruits
and vegetables for garden truck farming as well as harvesting of hay
crops. Today, they use the land for grazing cattle, harvesting coastal hay
and oats and fruits such as pecans, pears, peaches, plums and grapes
(Mikolajewski 1988).
The adaptation of farmland to ranching in the years following World War II followed a
pattern noted at other sites throughout Tidwell Prairie.

56 / TIDWELL PRAIRIE

Ed Okonski, who was born at 41RT254, related a dramatic account that depicts the
hazards and uncertainties associated with the production of cotton during the early
twentieth century. He noted that in the dry years, boll weevils would strip the crop and
make it worthless. Dry weather could also bring leafworms, which could prove equally
destructive to an entire season's yield. A common treatment for leafworm infestations
involved the use of strychnine. The poison would be placed in a small cloth and tied to
the end of a stick so the pests could be daubed with the lethal powder. The system worked
well, Okonski recalled, except for one time when the wind shifted, causing him to be
overcome by strychnine dust. His father found him in the field, nearly unconscious, and
revived him with large doses of sweet milk (Okonski 1986).
The Okonski family continues to utilize and maintain the farmstead and they plan to
apply for the Land Heritage Award when the property is eligible in the 1990s. A program
of the Texas Department of Agriculture, the Land Heritage Award honors farms and
ranches operated by individual families for over a century.
Testing
Work at 41Rf254 consisted primarily of mapping and photography. No subsurface
testing was conducted because the property is currently owned, administered, and oc­
cupied by members of the Okonski family who prefer that the grounds not be disturbed.
The lack of accessibility, however, does not affect recommendations for National
Register eligibility. The architectural features ofthe farmstead, representing two distinct
stages of historical development, are intact. As a result, there is no need to attempt a
reconstruction of the layout. The merit of the property is largely architectural and
contextual, not archeological. The mining company has no plans to disturb the property
during its operations.

41RT258: JOE FOYETT HOUSE
Site Description
This historic farm complex is located near the center of the broad, rolling upland
divide which separates Bee Branch and Big Willow Creek (Fig. 1). It consists of a
three-room frame house (Fig. 19), a storage shed, and a concrete-cased well. A small
creek runs approximately 150 feet east of the house. Any fences that may have delineated
the house yard and the barn area are no longer visible. The site slopes gently from west
northwest to east southeast, toward a creek. The house faces the southeast, with an
outlook downhill to the creek valley. A large crepe myrtle growing in front of the house
is the most visible of remaining landscape features that exhibit human influence. A
scattering of bricks was noted between the house and the well.

ELIGIBILITY TESTING / 57

FIGURE 19. Southeast oblique of Joe Foyett house, 41RT258.
Historical Background

41RT258 is situated in the southeast corner of the L. M. Simons survey (see 41RT260),
just east of the T-intersection in Tidwell Prairie. The property was included in a 400-acre
tract conveyed to T. C. Moore by a partition deed in 1872, when he divided his consider­
able landholdings with his partner J. C. Roberts (Robertson County Deed
Records:V/515).
In 1888, Moore divided off 95 acres for sale to Joe Foyett, a native of Pruss ian Poland.
The family name, like that of many other Polish families in the area, suffered from
misspellings in legal records. In his naturalization petition, Foyett spelled his name
Fogut. Other records also show it as Fojut and Foyt (Robertson County Court
Minutes:N649).
Joe Foyett's wife Napomaciena died in 1887, the year before he purchased the
farmland at 41RT258. The couple had five children--one son and four daughters. They
were: Antone; Buno (Szyforanski); Katy (Bianski); Francis (Markowski); and Pauline
(Grych) (Robertson County Deed Records:91/332).
According to local informants, Joe Foyett's family lived in the farmhouse at 41RT258.
He probably constructed it soon after he purchased the site, because records indicate he
died in the early 1890s. Although a 1927 affidavit indicates he died in 1902, his tombstone
gives the date as 1892 (it also shows the spelling of his name as Josef Foju t). Tax records
indicate that the 1892 date is correct; Joe Foyett is not listed as the taxpayer of record in
either the late 1890s or early 1900s (Robertson County Tax Abstracts; Floyd and Corn
1980:50).

58 / TIDWELLPRAIRIE

The Foyett farmhouse shows features of phased construction noted in other Tidwell
Prairie houses (Fig. 19). It appears the two rooms that comprise the central section were
built as one unit. A shed room was added later across the back. Exterior siding is of
board-and-batten construction and interior walls are covered with vertical planks. The
gabled roof is covered by corrugated tin sheeting over wood shingles. A porch extends
across the front elevation, covering a double entry and flanking windows with six-over-six
lights. The presence of exterior window hardware indicates the openings were screened
at one time. Ornamentation on the exterior was minimal. Although deteriorated, the
porch remains include evidence of chamfered posts and jigsawn detailing.
Also on the property is a storage building constructed of vertical planks with a wide
primary entrance indicating its use for vehicle storage. A concrete-cased well is located
between the building and the house, as is a scatter of three-hole, beige firebricks.
Minnie Yezak Foyett later wed Mike Okonski, who is shown as the homestead's
taxpayer as early as 1896. She retained title to the land, however, and even deeded one
acre out of the southwest corner in 1917 for use by the Tidwell Prairie school district
(Robertson County Tax Abstracts; Robertson County Deed Records:67/257).
After Minnie Okonski's death in 1927, there was a legal dispute over the settlement
of her estate. In order to resolve the matter, the court ordered the homestead sold
through a receiver. The new owner was Artie Rushing, owner of the community'S store
(see 41RT260). Artie and Loutishe Rushing never lived at 41RT258, preferring instead
to use it as rental property. They did, however, divide off portions of the land for use by
the school and Methodist church (Robertson County Deed Records:911328 and 92/234).
Following the deaths of both Rushings in the early 1930s, the farmstead became the
property of the Cottingham family. Cottingham descendants have maintained ownership
since that time (Robertson County Deed Records:911326; 911328; 105/180; 107/565;
120/10; and 140/439).
Testing

Testing at the site consisted of 89 shovel probes excavated on a 5 meter grid laid out
in line with the house. Test Unit A was placed north of the house in an area where probes
indicated an artifact concentration. Level 1 (0-20 cm) contained the majority of the
artifacts, although the unit was excavated to 50 cm, which was 2 cm into the B horizon
zone.
The shovel probes were excavated through brown loamy sand to reddish orange
mottled clay at 10 to 50 cm below the surface. Most of the artifacts were found in the
upper 10 to 20 cm. In the areas of more intense concentration north of the house, artifacts
were found to approximately 50 cm. Test excavations under the brick alignment east of
the house revealed that it was not a walkway, but might have served as a drain for an area
that is presently wet and boggy.

ELIGIBILITY TESTING I 59

Artifact Distribution

Test probes yielded from 0 to as many as 35 artifacts (Fig. 20). The probes produced
354 artifacts and Unit A produced 458. Artifacts appear to cluster behind the house and
the outbuildings, suggesting the possible location of a fenceline in the general vicinity.
The main dumping area was about 5 meters directly behind the house. Surface survey of
the creek banks did not identify any obvious dumping location, but rather a thin surface
scatter was spread over the area. A slight rise in artifact count at either end of the porch
suggests that foot traffic, and perhaps sweeping, displaced material primarily in these
directions.
Artifact Discussion

Decorated ceramics from this site include overglaze decal and painted designs, green­
and black-banded decoration, flown blue, and repousse designs. There are also the usual
whiteware and ironstone. One group of whiteware sherds bears the mark, "".R
LAUG... ," representing the Homer Laughlin China Company in business in Ohio and
West Virgina since 1874 (Barber 1904:110). Porcelain is decorated overglaze with
painted or decal designs. The stoneware sherds from crocks and jugs have a Bristol glaze,
and there are several sherds of yellow kitchenware (Table 8).
The proportion of clear glass containers on this site is relatively high, suggesting that
the occupation of the house lasted past the 1930s, when clear glass became cheap and
more universally used. Perhaps there were renters in the house after Mrs. Okonski's
death in 1927, or the house may have been used by hunters, as was the Weaver-Rushing
house at 41RT260.
The clear glass includes a whole machine-made bottle from the creek bank. It is
embossed with the following: "GROVES TASTELESS CHILL TONIC PREPARED BY
PARIS MEDICINE CO., ST. LOUIS," Fike (1987:234) suggests that this medicine was
made around 1900. The bottle bears the mark of an Owens bottle machine on the base,
which would date it sometime after 1903.
A clothes pin spring and a fragment of enameled iron represent housekeeping objects
recovered. Several sherds from an unglazed flower pot can also be counted in this group.
Under Clothes and Personal items, porcelain, shell, and metal buttons were found,
along with two small buckles which are probably from clothing or shoes, and a scissors
blade. A clothing snap fastener and part of an old-fashioned rubber raincoat fastener are
also part of the collection. Most of these items came from Unit A.
Children's toys from the site are well represented by a blue and white glass marble, a
metal jack, and pieces of four different porcelain dolls. Two fragments of slate also
belong in this category.
The following ammunition shell casings were found: Remington Express 410; UMC
Co. New Club No. 12; Remington New Club No. 12; and Remington Nitro Club No. 12.
Fragments of wire and hardware, along with miscellaneous metal fragments, come under

the Barn/Workshop category. Construction materials include the usual window glass and
nails. Barbed wire and fence staples were found across the site.
An unidentifiable dart point also turned up in the first level of Test Unit A. The find
probably indicates a collector in the family, since there were no other signs of prehistoric
activity in the vicinity.
Observations

The greater number and variety in the artifacts from this site are apRarent (Table 9).
Since the more personal items have consistently come from the 1 m2 test units, the
placement of the unit could significantly affect the total number of these objects
recovered, making at least part of the difference a product of fortuitous location of test
units. The variety and greater total number of artifacts from this site could also indicate
a slightly more prosperous standard of living for this particular family or a longer or more
intense period of occupation.
41RT261: THE CULL WILLIAMS HOMESITE
Site Description

Located on the west half of the upland divide separating Bee Branch and Big Willow
Creek (Fig. 1), 41RT261 consists of a collapsed residence and a small agricultural building
with a shed addition (Fig. 21). Few structural elements of the house remain, but there
are indications that it was a small frame building, approximately 20 x 25 feet in size.
Board-and-batten construction, a foundation of both sandstone blocks and vertical logs,
a gabled roof, and a brick chimney are evidenced by architectural debris. The chimney
pile yielded both Star and Groesbeck brand bricks.
Judging from the proportions of the house ruins and the location of the chimney fall
at the east end, the house would have faced southeast toward the county road. An old
fenceline runs northwest-southeast approximately 30 feet west of the house and perpen­
dicular to a more recent property fence between the county road and the house. The
absence of a break in this fence for access to the site indicates it was installed after
abandonment. Any other fences that may have once divided the area have been removed.

FIGURE 21. Partially collapsed remains of agricultural structure at 41RT261.

64 / TIDWELL PRAIRIE

The partially collapsed frame outbuilding was a barn or agricultural storage shed. A
shed addition was used for feeding and stabling purposes.
Historical Background

The land at 41RT261 shares a common early legal history with 41RT260 and 41RT252.
All were part of a grant awarded in the name of L. M. Simons in 1845. His heirs received
the 1476-acre tract and sold it within a few months to John Welch of Navarro County,
Texas. Subsequent owners included other individuals not listed as residents of the county.
In the 1870s, following a dispute over ownership of the land, J. C. Roberts of Robertson
County gained clear title. Roberts, who figured prominently in initiating Polish immigra­
tion to the area, owned several large tracts in the county in partnership with T. C. Moore.
Roberts and Moore first began partitioning their Simons league holdings in the early
1870s (Robertson County Deed Records:D/446; P/l95; P/l06; and 3/237).
The property at 41RT261, as it is now fenced, was never divided out as a separate
homestead. It was, instead, part of a larger tract that included land in the Thomas N.
Mudd survey, to the west of the Simons grant. The 232-acre tract also included 41RT260,
the Weaver-Rushing house. Jack Weaver was the first individual to farm the property,
and it was probably during his ownership that the structures at 41RT261 were built as part
of his tenancy operations. The tenancy system in Robertson County, like that in other
areas of the cotton-producing South, was on the increase in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries and was a vital part of agricultural production, particularly among
Anglo-American landowners.
An oral history informant, Mrs. Molly Williams Hamilton (b. 1901), lived at 41RT261
as a young girl. Her father was L. (Lewcullus?) "Cull" A. Williams (1855-1917), whose
family was from Panola County in East Texas. According to Mrs. Hamilton, Cull
Williams' father first moved his family to Brazos County, where he worked constructing
a raitHne. Presumably the line was the same one that later crossed Robertson County,
because the Williams family eventually settled at Tidwell Prairie. There in 1875, Cull
Williams married Mary Jane "Mollie" Rushing (b. 1859) (Hamilton 1986).
The elder Mollie Williams was a sister of Artie Rushing and a niece of Henry Jackson
Weaver (see 41RT260). Born near Montgomery, Alabama, she came with the Weaver
and Rushing families when they migrated to Texas following the Civil War (Alsup
1985:10).
The Williamses were active members of the Tidwell Prairie Methodist congregation.
The church history indicates the couple had nine children: Marion (b. 1879); Eva Jane
(b. 1882); Jess A. (b. 1885); L. A., Jr. (b. 1887); Joe (b. 1890); Nannie (b. 1892); Oliver
(b. 1894); Tina (b. 1897); and Molly (b. 1901) (Turner 1978:236). The Williams' cemetery
plot in the Tidwell Prairie Cemetery, however, contains the graves of two additional
children who died in infancy: Margie (b. 1876), and Eugene (b. 1877) Both are believed
to be the children of Cull and Mollie Williams (Davis and Utley 1987:Exhibit A).
A date of construction for the Cull Williams house could not be determined through
deed records, tax abstracts, or oral history. The latter proved helpful, however, in

establishing an approximate time of occupation. Mrs. Hamilton remembers that she
lived there while attending the Tidwell Prairie school. Given her date of birth, that would
place the Williams family on the property between 1908 and 1920. This would correspond
in land records with the latter years of the Weaver ownership and the earliest years of the
Rushing ownership. Mrs. Hamilton confirmed that her father rented the property.
Speaking of her Uncle Artie, she said: "He owned where we lived--he owned that land."
She also added: "We lived adjoining my uncle .... We had steps that went over the fence
to cut off going to his store" (Hamilton 1986).
Neither records nor oral history interviews indicated when the property was aban­
doned. It is presumed that utilization of the homesite followed a pattern of occupation
typical throughout the rural South in the twentieth century. The economic depression of
the 1930s, followed by industrial development associated with the war effort and by the
subsequent growth of cities, influenced a steady decline in rural population by the 1940s.
Testing

Test excavations consisted of 77 shovel probes. The grid was aligned with the
northwest-southeast fence line and probes were spaced at 5 meter intervals in the house
yard area and at 10 meter intervals throughout the farmyard.
Shovel probes encountered a 20 to 25 cm thick brown loamy sand overlying the
mottled clay B horizon. Maximum depth of artifacts was 10 to 15 cm. Probes along the
fenceline west of the house encountered loose brown sand containing charcoal flecks and
ash. Artifacts were more numerous in this area (Fig. 22) and Test Unit A, a 1 m2 unit,
was excavated near the probes yielding the highest concentration. Unit A produced 173
artifacts or 24% of the total number recovered from the site, all in Level 1 (0-20 cm).
Included in this collection are sherds of whiteware and porcelain, fragments of glass
containers, bottle caps, a fragment of slate, a metal clothing hook, window glass, and both
cut and wire nails.
Artifact Distribution

The test probes yielded from 0 to 66 artifacts with a total count from probes alone of
426. Their distribution is patterned much like the other sites investigated in that there
are concentrations to the northwest and northeast of the house in the backyard area and
a comparatively clear area immediately around the house. The heaviest artifact deposi­
tion is along the fence to the west. This is similar to the distribution noted at 41RT260,
where artifact concentrations were found along fencelines.
Artifact Discussion

The ceramics include whitewares decorated with transfer designs, floral decals, and
repousse or relief designs, as well as the usual predominance of sherds of undecorated
whiteware and ironstone vessels (Table 10). One repousse saucer (Fig. 13d) bears an

illegible maker's mark from an American factory. An ironstone sherd is marked
"Meakin", representing the factory of Alfred Meakin of Tunstall, England, in operation
since 1875 (Godden 1964:426).
The proportion of clear to colored bottle glass is lower on this site (1 to 1) than on
41RT251 (38%), 41RT252 (39%), and 41RT258 (32%), and particularly lower than at
41RT260 (30%) (Table 11). This may indicate that the site was not occupied past the
mid-1930s, when manufacturers began to produce clear glass containers in abundance
(Kendrick 1967:24). The only bottle caps recovered are crown caps, which were used
primarily on soda bottles.
Artifacts in the Household Furnishings category consist only of fragments of pressed
glass which could be parts of lamps or ornamental objects. One glass button and a
clothing hook were the only traces of Personal or Clothing category objects represented,
and a small fragment of slate is the only representative of Activities from the site. The
paucity of objects in these categories would appear to reflect a comparatively short
occupation by a family that had relatively few personal belongings.
The artifacts recovered in the Barn/Workshop and Construction categories are the
usual items found on the farmsteads tested. The brick used in the chimney is machine­
made from a factory rather than the handmade brick used on other sites in the area. This
could indicate a slightly later date of construction or the fact that the house was built by
a more well-to-do landowner.
Observations

The scarcity of personal objects on this site and the low percentage of clear glass
suggests a comparatively short occupation ending in the 1930s.

41RT271: HAILEY FAMILY HOMESITE

Site Description

The site of a family home and associated store, 41RT271 is located on the western half
of the broad, rolling upland divide which separates Bee Branch and Big Willow Creek
(Fig. 1). It is situated southeast of the T-intersection in Tidwell Prairie (Fig. 23). The
property consists of the site of a recently dismantled, small frame structure that was the
Hailey store, the foundations of the 1932 house that has been removed (Fig. 24), and the
locations of a smokehouse and barn. Other sheds and a corral still stand. Traces of
concrete sidewalks can be seen around the house site. The entire ground surface has
been disturbed by the various activities of house moving and demolition, and contem­
porary trash has been strewn over the surface. It is possible, however, to reconstruct some
outlines of the inner yard.
Historical Background

The property was initially included in the John Trudoe survey, the largest land grant
associated with the project area. Trudoe was an early Texas settler, listed as a resident of
Milam County by 1834. He died before 1846, when his heirs patented his grant (General
Land Office files; Robertson County Tax Abstracts).
The Trudoe tract was not broken up for small farms until the Reconstruction era. The
owner shortly before the turn ofthe century was John Thornton Stephenson (1845-1908).
A native of Kossuth, near Corinth in northeastern Mississippi, he served as a soldier in
the Civil War. Soon after the war, he moved his family from Tishomingo County,
Mississippi, in the Tennessee River valley, to Robertson County, Texas. They lived near
Hearne before eventually settling in the Beck Prairie community southeast of Tidwell
Prairie (Turner 1978:219; Robertson County Deed Records: 144/489).
John Thornton Stephenson died in 1908, and in the following years there were legal
disputes over disposition of his property. In 1912, as the result of a court partition decree,
the 50.5-acre tract that includes 41RT271 was awarded to the heirs of Sally Hailey, one
of Stephensons' daughters. They included: Thomas C. Hailey, Milissa N. Harvell, Cora
B. O'Brien, Willie T. Hailey, Gracie L. Hailey, Henry M. Hailey, and Johnny L. Hailey
(Robertson County District Court Records:Cause No. 5933). Over the ensuing years,
Willie T. Hailey began acquiring the interest rights of the other family members and
became sole owner by 1930.
Willie T. Hailey (1895-1975) was a rancher and community leader in Tidwell Prairie,
where he and his wife Malvina (b. 1896) raised seven children. Although an exact date
for construction of the first Hailey home at 41RT271 could not be determined, a local
resident recalled that it was a small, frame structure that faced southeast. Since it was
below the T-intersection, the north (rear) elevation backed to the road. Windows were
located only on the front and side elevations (Turner 1978:173; T. Yezak 1989).

FIGURE 24. Structures at 41RT271. The 1932 residence is in the background, with the Hailey

Store in the foreground. Photo taken in 1986 before structures were removed.
The Haileys replaced the early house with a larger residence in 1932. Built on the
site of the former home, the new structure was a frame bungalow with a detached gable
entry that faced the county road. Architectural features included a brick pier porch,
one-over-one windows, clapboard siding, exposed roof rafter ends, and bracketed eaves.
Contemporaneous structures on the property included a storage building and garage.
Later enlarged with an addition on the east elevation, the home has since been relocated
to Bremond.
After Artie Rushing and his wife died in the early 1930s, the community's only store
closed. In 1935, the Haileys decided to open a new store, which they constructed on
adjacent land west of the home tract. It remained in operation until the early 1970s. The
store, a small frame structure, was dismantled in 1989 and the building materials salvaged.
Testing

Test excavations consisted of 46 shovel probes, 38 of which were located on a 5 meter
grid laid out over the house site in line with the front sidewalk and, therefore, probably
in line with the house outline. The main purpose of the probes was to locate any
remaining traces of the first Hailey house, which a family member had said was located
on the same site as the 1932 house. No trace of an earlier structure was found. Additional
test probes were dug at the sites of the smokehouse and barn, but they yielded nothing
that could be directly related to those structures.

72 I TIDWELL PRAIRIE

Artifact Distribution

When charted, no particular patterns could be discerned in the artifact distribution,
which was fairly evenly dispersed over the area. The highest count (16) came from a
probe under the front of the house and consisted entirely of fragments from a metal
bucket.
Artifact Discussion

Of the 122 artifacts recovered (Table 12), ceramics, glass, and nails made up the largest
part (Table 13). The ceramics consisted mainly of undecorated whiteware and ironstone.
Only one fragment of stoneware was recovered. There was not enough glass to make a
definitive statement on the makeup of the collection. The brick fragment collected was
machine-made; however, handmade brick on the surface of the site is similar to that found
on 41RT251, 41RT252, and 41RT260. Perhaps the most remarkable artifact collected
from the site is a large, pink plastic flamingo lawn ornament.
Observations

The most obvious observation that can be made about this site and the results of the
testing is that the situation is confused and not likely to yield any important information.
It appears that the site was occupied during the second quarter of the twentieth century,
but little can be determined about the family who lived there from the results of the
testing program.
Oral history yielded the best information on the family. Richard Hailey, a family
member and a current resident of Tidwell Prairie, provided important background
material on the activities at the site. The property's mixed use, both as a residence and
as a commercial area, and the construction of new buildings in the 1930s, could explain
the lack of definitive artifact patterning.

CONCLUSIONS

Research conducted during the testing phase of the Walnut Creek Mine project has
yielded significant information on settlement patterns, acculturation trends, early twen­
tieth century agricultural practices, rural ethnicity, and the evolution of land utilization.
The community of Tidwell Prairie served as a logical focal point for understanding the
variety of cultural, political, religious, and economical influences experienced by rural
inhabitants in Robertson County, especially in the time frame between Reconstruction
and World War II. The research, while localized, will make an important contribution to
expanded contexts that include state and regional histories.
Equally important to a broader understanding of historic sites in Texas are two specific
elements of the testing program methodology: archeology and oral history. First, data
from archeological fieldwork were used to generate artifact distribution maps used in site
layout analysis. Where structures were extant, the site distribution maps provided
information on family activities and on building utilization. When sites lacked well­
defined structural elements, the maps were helpful in establishing a probable model of
yard and farm patterning.
Artifact distribution maps were especially helpful in composing a model for living
habits and in determining trash disposal customs. Apparently, trash disposal habits in
Tidwell Prairie were similar to those noted by Jurney and Moir (1987) at Richland Creek
and by Fox (1986) in McMullen County. The area immediately surrounding the houses
was relatively clear of debris, with bands or accumulations of materials deposited at a
distance to the rear, to the side, or along fence lines that delineated the inner yard. This
orientation is similar to that observed by Fox (Fox, Day, and Highley 1980:112) in a
small-town setting in Chambers County.
The comparative number of artifacts per site, as revealed in the test probes (Table
14), showed a distinct contrast between 41RT260 and the other tested sites. This is
apparently a reflection of comparative prosperity rather than length of occupation or
ethnic background.
Oral history proved to be an integral part of the research plan due to the large number
of local residents who were descendants of original or early settlers. In some instances,
these residents had personal ties to Tidwell Prairie that dated from the earliest decades
of the twentieth century. Informants were used initially to locate sites and to provide
background material on families associated with specific properties. Later, in-depth
interviews were conducted in order to supplement archival research. The emphasis was
on social history, with questions related to genealogy, migration, customs, community
institutions, agricultural practices, and local commerce. Where feasible, oral history was
used to substantiate archival information.
The archeological and historical investigations of the historic sites in the Walnut
Creek Mine area produced several interesting observations. First, all of the sites con­
tained homes originally oriented with the primary facade aligned to the southeast. This

was particularly evident at 41RT260 and 41RT271 (the original house only), where the
houses were not aligned with existing roads. The choice of orientation was also obvious
at 41RT252 and 41RT258, where there were no nearby county roads to influence the
decision. Crosby (1977:36-37) has observed, "It was common practice in East Texas to
orient the front of the house to the south or southeast to take advantage of the prevailing
breezes in the summer and the warmth of the sun in the winter." He added that the
practice was not limited to East Texas.
Also observed was a lack of differentiation between predominantly Anglo-American
sites and those settled by Poles. The kinds of artifacts and their distribution within the
sites were similar regardless of the occupants' native background. This is probably
attributable to acculturation. The Poles who settled at Tidwell Prairie represented a
second wave of migration. Most originally settled near New Waverly in Montgomery
County before proceeding on to Robertson County. The point of acculturation, there­
fore, would have been the earlier community. By the time the Poles moved into
Robertson County, their traditions and customs had been subject to several years of East
Texas vernacular influences.
Just as traditions and customs are altered during the second wave of migration, so too
are the types of artifacts carried by the families. Traditional, Old World pieces would
more likely be found at sites directly related to the initial point of emigration. Even there,
the conditions of trans-oceanic travel during the late nineteenth century limited the kinds
and numbers of artifacts that could be transported. As the family moved overland, they
were more likely to transport items purchased or acquired at their original point of
settlement.

76/ TIDWELLPRAIRIE

The Tidwell Prairie properties researched for this report represent a cross-section of
agriculturally-related sites in the area. Together they reflect the ethnicity, economics,
and culture that were part of the community's historical development. Of the sites
reviewed, one (41RT260) has been determined eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. Another, 41RT254, may be considered eligible because of
its architecture and the integrity of the farmstead layout. Since it is privately owned, the
owners should be notified of its potential as a National Register site and encouraged to
pursue the listing process.
The remaining historic sites, 41RT251, 41RT252, 41RT258, 41RT261, and 41RT271
are not considered candidates for National Register listing under the four general
evaluation criteria. Criterion A provides for sites that "are associated with events that
have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history" (Steely
1984:iii). While the Tidwell Prairie sites have added to the volume of information about
westward migration, changing agricultural practices, and the evolution of rural farming
communities in Texas, their overall contribution to the topics would not be considered
significant. They remain primarily complementary sites within broader contexts.
The sites do not qualify for listing under Criterion B because they are not "associated
with the lives of persons significant in our past." Similarly, the structures do not represent
distinctive architectural styles, artistic values, construction methods, or craftsmanship, as
provided for under Criterion C.
Criterion D affords consideration for potential archeological findings, but field test­
ing revealed the limited integrity of remaining deposits. The sites are unlikely to yield
the quantity and the quality of artifacts necessary for thorough diagnostic analysis. The
lack of integral intact deposits is offset, however, by the availability of good archival and
oral history resources. Documents and interviews were essential elements in the
preparation of comprehensive site studies that provided the basis for the evaluation
process.
