A Wooden Mortar and Pestle
From Val Verde County, Texas
MICHAEL

B.

COLLINS AND THOIVIAS ROY HESTER

ABSTRACT
This paper describes a wooden mortar and pestle found by spelunkers
in a small cave near Pandale, in Val Verde County, Texas. Cactus seeds
(Opuntia sp.) were found in the mortar, suggesting that one function of
the implements was the preparation of plant parts for food. Ethnographic
accounts have mentioned the presence of wooden mortars and pestles in the
aboriginal cultures of southwestern Texas and northern Mexico; although
perishable artifacts are abundant in the dry caves of this region, the speci
mens described in this paper are the first of their type to be reported.
In February, 1968, David G. Cooke and Glenn Southard (spelunkers
from Ozona, Texas) entered a small cave near the mouth of Big
Fielder’s Canyon in the vicinity of Pandale, Val Verde County, Texas
(Fig. 1). Cigarettes accidentally dropped behind a ledge by the
spelunkers led to the discovery of a wooden mortar and pestle evi
dently cached beneath an overhang in the ledge. Cooke and Southard
reported their find to the Department of Anthropology, The Univer
sity of Texas at Austin. The authors, accompanied by Mary Ringwood
Bacon of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project, examined and
photographed the specimens at Ozona in March, 1968.
The cave in which the mortar and pestle were found is in the Pecos
River canyon near Pandale Crossing, approximately 22 miles north
of Langtry and 65 miles northwest of Del Rio, Texas. The region is an
extensive tableland of limestone (the Edwards and Stockton plateaus)
that has been deeply dissected by three major rivers, (Pecos, Rio
Grande, and Devils) and countless small streams. Rockshelters and
caves are numerous in these canyons and many show evidence of
aboriginal occupation. Aridity has occasioned the preservation of a
wide variety of perishable debris and artifacts in some of the shelters.
The archeological material from these sites exhibits the general char
acteristics of the widespread Desert Culture (Suhm and others, 1954;
Lehmer, 1960; johnson, 1964; Story, 1966). Occupation by peoples
who practiced gathering of plant foods, fishing, and hunting evidently
began at least 6,000 years ago and lasted until historic times. Cultural
change was minimal over this entire period—even the brief influx of
bison hunters at about 700 B.C. and the introduction of the bow and
arrow at about A.D. 1400 failed to alter significantly the economy

based on hunting, gathering and fishing (Dibble, 1968; Johnson, 1964;
Story, 1966). The prehistoric cultural trait relevant to the present
paper is the gathering and preparation of Opuntia (prickly pear) tuna
for plant food. Prickly pear tuna (as well as lechuguilla and sotol)
provided a substantial part of the diet throughout the long periods of

WOODEN MORTAR AND PESTLE

3

occupation. Various techniques of baking in earth ovens seem to have
been employed in preparation of the agave and sotol whereas prickly

pear tuna was evidently eaten raw or prepared in various ways
(including pulverization). Human feces (currently under analysis)
from late prehistoric deposits in a shelter near the mouth of the Pecos
River contain whole Opuntia seeds as well as other plant and animal
parts (V. M. Bryant, Jr., personal communication). It seems clear
that gathering of desert plant foods was the major means of subsistence
for over 8,000 years. Bedrock mortars and oval-basin metates (both
portable and in bedrock) occur at most sites in the area and presum
ably served in food preparation. Pestles are rare (or have escaped
recognition). The large samples of perishable artifacts from the area
contain little or nothing that would suggest the use of wooden crushing
implements.
Historic documents record the presence of numerous groups, mostly
of Coahuiltecan linguistic affiliation, in the Edwards Plateau and Rio
Grande Valley regions. These were food gatherers who also practiced
fishing and some hunting. Jumanos and numerous other Indian groups
inhabited the general region in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.
Apaches were reported in Big Fielder’s Canyon in 1879, and Coman
ches crossed the region frequently during the 19th century (Hackett,
1926 and 1931; Newcomb, 1961; Bolton, 1911; Kirkland, 1942; Rueck
ing, 1955; Campbell, ms.). The various Coahuiltecan groups were fre
quently reported to have gathered Opuntia tunas and one reference
mentions use of wooden mortars (Ruecking, 1955; Bandelier, 1905).
The wooden mortar and pestle were discovered in a small cave
(University of Texas site designation: 41 VV 425) on a rocky hillside
on the west bank of the Pecos River. The cave is in a thick ledge about
one-third of the distance up the hillside from the river, and just north
of the mouth of Big Fielder’s Canyon. There are numerous other small
caves, crevices, and shelters in the immediate vicinity, most of which
seem to be devoid of cultural remains. The cave faces south and is
about 10 feet high at the mouth and only 2 to 3 feet wide; it extends
back into the hill for a distance of about 15 to 20 feet. Near the back
of the cave, a ledge extends into the passageway, and it was on the
surface beneath this ledge that the mortar and pestle were found. The
mortar lay on its side and the pestle was nearby. The floor of this
small cave is covered with roof spalls and there is no evidence of any
cultural deposit; however, some smoke staining on the roof is present
at the mouth of the cave. A few lithic artifacts (including a contracting
stem dart point) were collected from the hillside below the cave.
The mortar (Fig. 2, a, b, d and e) appears to have been fashioned

from a section of a tree with fine, straight-grained wood (probably
pine), from which the bark had been removed. The height of the
specimen is 31 cm., with maximum diameters at the rim and base of
17.6 and 18.3 cm. The interior cavity is 18 cm. deep; the lip of the
rim has been rounded and smoothed, and is beveled along one-third
of its interior circumference. The interior is roughly conical in vertical
section (Fig. 2, a; Fig. 3). There is a charred area extending in a band

gesting that the cavity was formed by a process of alternately charring
and scraping (Fig. 2, d; Fig. 3, b, c). The interior is polished from use;
several small pebbles, embedded at the bottom of the cavity, are ground
smooth, and cactus seeds (Opuntia sp.) were discovered in the cracks
(caused by desiccation) along the sides (Fig. 2, a). The cactus seeds
were tightly wedged in the cracks and had to be pried out with a knife
blade; evidently, the mortar was used after cracks had developed.
The central part of the base of the mortar is a concave depression
about 2 cm. deep (Fig. 2, e; Fig. 3, e). The rim of the basal depression
is rounded and smoothed.
The exterior of the mortar does not appear to have been modified to
any extent. There is a small oval depression opposite the charred band
on the interior. It was impossible to determine if the depression was
the result of charring and scraping, or of wear, although it appeared
to be slightly charred.
The pestle (Fig. 2, c) is a section of what is tentatively identified as
a pecan shoot. from which the branches have been trimmed. The
entire length is smoothed, and the knobs left by the removal of the
branches are polished, probably from repeated handling. One end is
conical and somewhat rounded; it is this end that was evidently used
in conjunction with the mortar (upper end in Fig. 2, c). The opposite
end which is also rounded but exhibits several cutmarks, has not been
smoothed, and shows no evidence of use. Large cracks, resulthg from
desiccation, extend almost the entire length of the specimen. It is
58 cm. long, and has an average diameter of about 4.5 cm.
Wooden mortars and pestles have not been previously recorded in
the archeological literature of Texas and northern Mexico. Alonso de
Leon (1905) states that Coahuiltecan bands in Nuevo Leon, Mexico,
used wooden mortars to crush seeds and other foods, but descriptive
details are lacking. Cabeza de Vaca recorded the use of wooden pestles
by Indians in either southwestern Texas or northeastern Mexico.
These pestles were used to pulverize mesquite bean pods, the juice of
which was mixed with earth and then consumed (Bandelier, 1905).
Wooden mortars and pestles have been recorded among cultures
over much of North America (Hodge, 1912; Driver and Massey,
1957), but none have been noted in southwestern Texas or north
eastern Mexico.
SUMMARY
A wooden mortar and pestle from near Pandale in Val Verde
County, Texas, have been described, and represent the first examples
of these implements from this region. The presence of cactus seeds in

the mortar suggests at least one function of the implements—the
processing of plant parts for food. While ethnographic accounts dealing
with the Indians of southwestern Texas and northeastern Mexico note
the presence of the wooden mortar and pestle, no examples of these
artifacts have come to light in the extensive excavations of dry shelters
in this area.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The authors would like to thank Dr. T. N. Campbell, Professor of
Anthropology, The University of Texas at Austin, for his helpful
criticisms regarding this paper. Identification of the Opuntia seeds
from the mortar was made by Vaughn M. Bryant, Jr., of the Depart
ment of Botany, The University of Texas at Austin; for this and the
information he supplied on his analysis of human feces from site
41 VV 162, we are grateful.
ADDENDA
After this paper was submitted for publication, a fragment of wood
from the mortar was examined by Mr. Marvin A. Stokes of the Labo
ratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. Mr. Stokes
believes that the wood is conifer, possibly pinyon (Pinus cembroides).

ABSTRACT
The second and final season of salvage excavations at Coral Snake
Mound is reported. Excavations demonstrate that the mound was built in
three stages. Several artifact caches together with a number of cremations
and burials were recovered. Bone tempered (Caddoan-appearing) sherds
were found together with a number of Lower Valley wares including
Marnsville Plain, Marksville Incised and Lake Borgne Incised. It is sug
gested that this association argues for a reconsideration of Krieger’s align
ment of Alto I with Marksville-Hopewell.
INTRODUCTION
The Coral Snake Mound (X16SA48) was investigated early in 1965
by personnel of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project under the
direction of Burney McClurkan. McClurkan’s report (1966) describes
the physical appearance of the mound prior to excavation and its
archeological content.
Coral Snake Mound is located in the NE 1/4 of the SE 1/4 of Section
33, T6N, R 13 W, in Sabine Parish, Louisiana. The mound itself was
situated on a terrace remnant of the Sabine River, well within its
flood plain. We were informed by a man who once owned the property
that at the turn of the century, the mound and surrounding area was
devoid of vegetation and that all of the area but the mound was planted
in cotton. Around 1910, the area was abandoned, and now thick stands
of large mixed pine and hardwoods together with dense undergrowth
cover the area.
The following report describes the 1966—1967 excavations at the
mound. Fourteen days were spent excavating the remaining portions
of the mound (Fig. 1). The unexcavated portions included the south
easteni quarter and sections of the other quadrants. It was hoped that
further excavation in these areas would give us information on mound
construction and provide a more complete artifact sample. Previous
investigations had recovered what appeared to be Caddoan sherds
(incised decoration and bone temper) together with Marksville pot
tery. The unique nature of this apparent association gave further
impetus to our second season at the mound.
The advice and criticism of several persons was of considerable

help during the analysis of materials from Coral Snake Mound.
Edward B. Jelks, R. K. Harris and Burney McClurkan offered valuable
suggestions throughout all phases of this report. Kathleen Gilmore and
Lawrence Aten assisted with the ceramic analysis. Mark Parsons
served as field assitant during our work at the mound, and James V.
Sciscenti helped edit portions of the manuscript.
EXCAVATION PROCEDURES
Initial steps in excavation consisted of removal of slump sand and

cleaning the surface of vegetation; backdirt from the 1965 season was
shifted from the lower parts of the mound. During the clearing, a
number of survey stakes and pins were found. An expanded and cor
rected grid was set up utilizing these stakes, thus tying our data in
with McClurkan’s.
Artifactual material and features were relatively scarce in the
mound fill. Because of this, unexcavated areas rather than squares
were the excavation units. The various areas were shovel scraped
horizontally, and deeper tests were made for profiling the remaining
portions of the mound.
STRATIGRAPHY
Three distinct stratigraphic zones were encountered at Coral Snake
Mound (Figs. 2 and 3).

type of parent organic material. The zone is fairly well developed and
is uniform throughout much of the area.
Zone lilA is a mottled tan sand layer, characterized by a uniform
appearance and occasional concentrations of iron-stain lines in the
lower portion. The layer varies in thickness near the center of the
mound with a maximum thickness of 2.1 meters, which tapers to less
than 30 centimeters toward the periphery of the mound.
Zone II comprises what might be called the primary mound. The
fill is composed of a mottled brown sand with a wet consistency
similar to that of Zone lila; however, there is a noticeable color
difference when Zone II and III sands are dried and compared. Zone
II fills the subfloor basin and extends beyond the edge of the basin for
a diztance of at least one meter.
Zone I, the surface upon which the mound was constructed, is
composed of a medium grained sand containing a trace of manganese
concretions. The zone reaches a maximum depth of 1.8 meters, and
gradually grades into a red-orange sandy silt of undetermined depth.
MOUND CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING STAGES
Three distinct stages of construction are involved at Coral Snake
Mound. During the first stage, a basin-shaped depression 1.2 meters
deep and 6 meters in diameter was excavated into the existing flood
plain. The level of the floodplain was at an elevation of between
ninety-five and ninety-six feet. Subsequent to the filling of the basin,
cremations were intruded and several fire basins were prepared. Fill
for the basin extended somewhat above the original floodplain (ca.
60 centimeters to 90 centimeters at the center). Stage II, then, formed
what might be called the primary mound—a low, conical structure
about 90 centimeters high and 12 to 15 meters in diameter. Much of
this primary mound was composed of borrow from the first stage.
Apparently, fill from the basin was piled around the edges of the pit;
profiles show that some of this was left in place when refilling took
place. This undisturbed fill formed the outer edge of the primary
mound.
In the final building period, the primary mound was completely
covered with sand; at various intervals, cremations, hearths, burials
and caches were placed in the fill of the mound. Some of the fill came
from a borrow pit encircling the mound, though this borrow pit could
not have been the source for all of the fill used, as the completed
mound was 3 meters high and nearly 30 meters in diameter. No other
borrow pits were found in the vicinity of the mound.
Subsequent to the completion of Coral Snake Mound, several pot-

13

CORAL SNAKE MOUND

holes were dug into the mound. Three of these were noted by Mc
Clurkan (1966: 4—5), and two additional and apparently quite old
potholes were found during 1966. These potholes could only be seen
in vertical profile due to the nature of mound fill. Excavations were
constantly impeded by slump; a large cave-in of the north-south wall
of the southeast quarter prevented measurement of the upper portions
of these potholes, which are represented by hatched lines on the figures.
ARCHEOLOGICAL FEATURES
A total of fifty-nine archeological features were encountered during
excavations at Coral Snake Mound. These features include artifact
caches, fire basins, burials, cremations, ochre concentrations, and some
single artifact finds. Most of the features encountered during 1966,
as in the earlier work, had a funerary function. The presence of human
bone and the presence of artifact and ochre caches support this con
clusion. The highly acid nature of mound soils precluded the discovery
of intact or well preserved unburned bone. In many cases, only
enameled tooth caps which had been in contact with copper were
preserved. In spite of poor bone preservation, I believe that all artifact
caches represent burial offerings. It would appear that the Coral Snake
Mound functioned as a cemetery.
THE ARTIFACTS
A variety of artifacts were found in the mound fill and in archi
tectural features described above. The following artifact classes are
recognized for Coral Snake Mound: stone, ceramics, metal, pigment
and glass.
STONE

Large Stemmed Points (Fig. 4)
Number of Specimens: 3 (Table 1)
Dimensions: Lengths, 182 mm. and 187 mm.; widths, 56 mm. and
59 mm.; thickness, 9 mm. each for Feature 30 specimens. The point
from Feature 31 is 150 mm. long, 36 mm. wide, and 9 mm. thick.
Description: The specimen blades are symmetrical and triangular.
All three specimens have large thinning flake scars radiating from
each edge on both faces and the edges have been retouched. Well
made shoulders are present, forming a 90 degree angle with the blade
on one specimen, and being slightly barbed on the other side. Two of
the points have stems showing transverse burin blows on the base;
the remaining point has a slightly expanding stem. The two points
found in Feature 30 are made of gray (Duck River?) chert. The

jority of these are made on locally found chert pebbles. Table 2. gives
the distribution of the specimens.
Debitage and Debris
Debitage and debris from the site consists of by-products of the main
industry. Some of the flakes are residue from the preparation and
treatment of cores; others consist of trimming flakes derived from
manufacture of bifacial tools. Table 3 presents the distribution of the
material.
CERAMICS

A detailed paste and temper analysis was made on the ceramics from
Coral Snake Mound. Bone tempered sherds usually associated with
Caddoan archeological manifestations were found within the mound
fill in contexts of unquestionable Marksville age. Table 4 presents
provenience data for this material.

Coral Snake Mound (Tables S and 6). The sample contains 19 copper
beads, one copper pendant, one copper earspool, and one copper frag
ment.
Beads
The copper beads are of the rolled, tubular variety. Most of the
beads are square or rectangular in cross section, suggesting that they
were beaten out on a mandril (Fig. 10, c). The round or oval speci
mens (Beads 13, 17, 18 and 19) have irregular holes, suggesting that
they were molded around soft material which was later forced out.
Preservation of the beads varies from thin patination to complete
oxidation. Beads 1 and 2 were fused by oxidation. Oxidation preserved
twine inside Beads 3,4,5,6, 7, 8 and 17 (Fig. 10, g). Beads S through
8 were found in a row and may have been part of a bracelet. Bead 17,
the largest bead found, (Fig. 10, b) weighs 44 grams.

A rather large bead, this specimen (Number 18) was rolled from a
long strip of copper. The bead is 17 mm. long, 18.5 mm. wide, and has
an inside diameter of 9 mm. (Table 6).
Copper Fragment
Dimensions: Length, 24 mm.; width, 18 mm.; thickness, 0.6 mm.;
diameter of perforation, 2 mm.
Description: This is a small, perforated copper pendant or gorget
fragment. The original shape or size is not ascertainable (Table 6).
Remarks: A fragment of this specimen was sent to the Argonne
National Laboratory for trace element analysis, in an attempt to de

termine the origin of this copper. Results were inconclusive.
GLASS
Beads (Fig. 10, d and e)

Number of Specimens: 2.
Description: Both of these specimens represent Type 61 described
by Harris and Harris (1967: 145) as small, dark blue, translucent,
tube-shaped, simple beads that were tumbled. Bead Type 61 fails into
Harris’ (1967: 156) Period 2 between 1740 and 1767.
DISCUSSION
Excavations at Coral Snake Mound during 1966—1967 clarified the
origin and nature of the mound. Archeological features, for the most

part, are associated with either the second or third mound construction
stage. The first stage consisted of excavating a central basin only. The
second stage or refilling of this basin has inclusive material, as does
the cap or mound Stage 3.
A potential problem arises in separating the deliberate from the
accidental inclusions of cultural material in the mound. Some basic
assumptions must be made concerning this; the nature and source of
fill for the mound construction, as well as what might be expected in
this fill, are of major importance. A moat-like borrow pit encircled
most of the mound; this excavation may have had sufficient fill to
account for Stage 2 construction, but not for Stage 3. No other borrow

CORAL SNAKE MOUND

pits were found near the mound, and tests in the vicinity suggested
that no cultural material was present in the mound area before it was
constructed. Yet we have apparent random inclusions of potsherds,
dart points, debris and debitage, materials normally expected in a
midden deposit.
Burials with offerings, cremationz, large ceremonial points, copper
ornaments and ceramic vessels are not usually part of midden debris.
Such items are considered to be purposeful inclusions into the mound,
and their placement with relation to building stages bears this out to
some extent. On the other hand, the flint debris, isolated sherds and
projectile points reflect accidental inclusion into the mound fill and
their relative lack of distributional patterning bears this out to a great
extent.
With the exception of the two glass trade beads found deep in the
center of the mound, the remaining materials are prehistoric, and
either contemporaneous with or predate construction of the mound.
The distribution of various features illustrates several trends at the
site (Tables 7—11). Most of the artifact caches are concentrated in the
outer mound cap. Five additional caches found by McClurkan were
associated with this stage. The two ochre concentrations were associ
ated with the contact zone between Stages 2 and 3, and probably were
placed upon the surface of the primary mound as offerings before it
was covered up.
The fire basins (Table 8) are associated with the second stage of
construction, and the single fire basin found by McClurkan in 1965
appears to have been associated with Stage 3.
The burials at Coral Snake Mound (Table 9) are single or multiple
secondary types. Ten of these were interred during Stage 2, and two
are associated with Stage 3. The bone concentrations reported by
McClurkan apparently were associated with the latter stage.
Twenty-seven of twenty-nine cremations (Table 10) were found in
the Stage 2 fill of the mound. Few, if any, are in situ cremations, but
are secondary interments of burned bone. The large cremations found
well within the central basin, Features 54, 57 and 60, all appeared to be
in situ cremations. One cremation was found in the Stage 3 level of the
mound, and one was situated at the contact between Stages 2 and 3.
Isolated dart points, knives and potsherds were distributed in equal
quantities between Stages 2 and 3 (Table 11). Lithic artifacts were
concentrated in the Stage 2 fill with the ceramic debris clustering in
the Stage 3 portion, possibly indicating an interval between the com
pletion of Stage 2 and the construction of Stage 3, or that borrow for
the mound came from two different locales, one an essentially non-

between Stages 2 and 3. Stage 2 ceramics include one Lake Borgne

Generally, the above dates would suggest that the mound was built
in stagcs—.-—over a period of time. Sample TX-265 reflects a not-too-

unreasonable “outside” date for terminal Marksville. Sample TX-244
is obviously not associated with a Marksville building stage of the
mound, but rather with a later, perhaps historical, intrusion into the
mound.
Relationships between the Coral Snake Mound builders and other
areas are apparently somewhat diverse. The Marksville Plain vessel
found in Feature 9 appears to be a trade item from the Lower Missis
sippi Valley; similarly, the Tchefuncte Plain and Lake Borgne Incised
sherds appear to be imported. The Marksville Stamped vessel and
several Marksville Stamped sherds, on the other hand, may have been
locally made, as the paste, temper, and surface characteristics differ
from the central arid southern Louisiana materials. Explanations for
this would include Marksville women marrying into northwestern
Louisiana or perhaps the diffusion of ideas along with the trade of
imported items mentioned above. Since the Marksville Stamped ves
sel was associated with datable carbon (TX-442) and the date of 20
BC is compatible with fuilbiown Lower Valley Marksville cultural
expression, either explanation could be possible. The Caddoan sherds
from the Stage 3 portion of the mound are also locally made.
Two of the large ceremonial points were made of gray chert litho
logically similar to Duck River material in western Tennessee. Twenty
flakes of this gray chert were found in the mound fill, and these speci
mens primarily represent biface thinning or eclat de taille flakes, a
by-product of the manufacture of thin bifaces. The presence of this
material suggests that blanks or prefornis were brought into the area.
The finished products being manufactured locally. Four pink-white
novaculite eclat de taille flakes and a dart point fragment show that
novaculite was also imported. Two pieces of oolitic chert, a dolomite
flake and dart point fragment, further suggest the use of non-local
materials. The nearest known source of dolomite and oolitic chert is
the Arbuckle Mountains in Oklahoma.
There is considerable evidence for trade between the Toledo Bend
area and other areas. This trade appears to have been of a rather selec
tive nature; the presence of Lower Valley sherds in a Lower Valley
burial mound is expected. The presence of Lower Valley design ele
ments on local clays and tempers implies more than trade, i.e., an ex
change of people and/or ideas. The non-local lithic materials—Duck
River flint, novaculite, oolitic chert and dolomite were probably sought
after because they could be made into larger implements. The local
river pebbles (chert) average under 10—15 centimeters in length,

CORAL SNAKE MOUND

41

thereby precluding the manufacture of large ceremonial or burial
points.
Copper is not native to the Sabine River drainage; possible sources
for the Coral Snake copper could be northern Georgia or the Upper
Great Lakes Region. It is impossible to determine the origin of copper
ornaments from the mound until native copper trace element studies
are completed. A neutron activation analysis of two copper samples,
one from Coral Snake Mound and one from Jonas Short Mound, was
run by Dr. Richard W. Ramette, then of Argonne National Labo
ratory:
“Sample X16SA48 (Louisiana) showed a silver concentration of 290
parts per million, and a mercury concentration of 9.4 ppm.
“Sample 4ISA1OI (Texas) was: silver, 300 ppm, mercury, 16 ppm.
“Thus, the two samples do not differ much from each other, and they are
about what we would expect for native copper in this country. We have not
been able to devise, as previously hoped, a procedure for tracing copper
sack to its source. Not enough elements show up in activation analysis.”
Trade beads from a deep pothole at the center of the mound suggest
some antiquity for the disturbance. At the adjacent site (X16SA1),
an early historical artifact was found during excavations; the piece is
a cast brass French trigger guard finial, which may date to the early
or middle eighteenth century. The trigger guard was found 30 meters
due east of the mound about 1 meter below the surface. Both the beads
and trigger guard appear to represent French trade. One Carbon 14
date (TX-244) of AD 1740 from the mound agrees with the estimated
age of the historical artifacts recovered (Pearson, Davis, Tamers, 1966:
462). The relationship between the material dated and the historical
artifacts is unclear.
There is, unfortunately, little comparative data concerning the
Marksville problem, especially from the Caddoan area. The Jonas
Short Mound reported by Jeiks (1965) includes the greatest amount
of comparative material for the area. Similarities between the Jonas
Short and Coral Snake mounds include: subfloor pits with in situ
cremations, two subsequent mound building stages above the pit, bor
row pits encircling the mounds, caches of artifacts including large
ceremonial points, copper ornaments, perforated teeth and boat stones.
Jonas Short lacks: prepared fire hearths, isolated secondary cremations,
non-cremated burials, ochre concentrations and ochre with caches,
and Marksville pottery. While there are many parallels between the
two mounds, there appear to be equally as many differences, suggest
ing their construction by perhaps related, but not sanguinal, groups.

42

The Bellevue Mound reported by Fulton and Webb (1955) is also
an early site with Lower Mississippi Valley affiliations. The mound
had a shallow subfloor basin on a prepared clay platform containing
a flexed adult burial. Two fragmentary cremations were found near
the center the mound. Although no grave furniture accompanied the
burials, lithic and ceramic artifacts were found in the mound fill. Only
one identifiable sherd was found, a Churupa Punctated specimen.
This, together with paste and temper characteristics of the remaining
sherds, suggested a Marksville affiliation for the mound. It might be
further noted that 14 of the 752 sherds found during excavations were
bone tempered.
The Crooks Site reported by Ford ad Willey (1940) is the only
remaining well documented Marksville period burial mound. Simi
larities between the Crooks Site and the others described above, espe
cially Jonas Short and Coral Snake, are as follows; the mound was
built in three stages, had an encircling moat-like borrow pit, burials
were scattered throughout the mound, fire hearths or evidence of fire
was present, grave furniture, including pottery vessels, was present,
ground stone artifacts, ochre and copper offerings were present. One
notable absence is the apparent lack of cremations at the Crooks Site
(they were present in the other three sites). The Crooks Site is located
in central Louisiana in what might be termed the Marksville “heart
land.” So, while there are qualitative differences between these
mounds, the similarities are obvious.
It appears that the Jonas Short, Bellevue and Coral Snake Mounds
are all Marksville affiliates. Moreover, as these sites are peripheral or
marginal to the Marksville heartland, they reflect local, as well as
Marksvillian ceremonial traits. Of particular import are the bone
tempered sherds at Bellevue and the Caddoan appearing sherds at
Coral Snake. These sherds, while not assignable as yet to either the
Gibson or Fulton Aspects, or even a fuliblown Caddoan ceramic tradi
tion, are more definitely Caddoan than Lower Mississippi Valley.
Whether these Caddo-like sherds represent pre-Caddoan, proto-Cad
doan or incipient Caddoan is a moot question. The reality of the situa
tion is that bone tempered and otherwise Caddoan-like sherds are pres
ent in artificial earth works generally considered to predate anything
Caddoan by at least five hundred years. The earlier Caddoan sites—
Gahagan, Spiro, Crenshaw, and Davis—didn’t come into being over
night. They probably developed and changed as rapidly as Fulton de
velopecl from Gibson or over about five hundred years. We are not
trying to suggest that the Caddoan tradition developed out of Marks
yule, but rather that Marksville may have been the impetus or catalyst

to a number of incipient local early pottery makers that developed
into Caddos, i.e., Marksville plus local pottery wares equals early
Caddoan wares.
CONCLUSIONS
Coral Snake Mound is a component of the Marksville culture outside
what might be considered its heartland or area of expected influence.
The mound had three distinct building stages. Stage one is represented
by the excavation of a subfloor pit in which several cremations were
prepared. Stage two includes the filling of this pit and the building of
a small, circular mound above the spot. Stage three is represented by a
cap which covered the primary or stage two portion.
Certain types of features were essentially unique to either the pri
mary mound or mound cap. Caches were for the most part associated
with the mound cap, ochre concentrations between the primary mound
and the cap, fire basins with the primary mound, as were burials and
cremations. Points, knives and stone debris were fairly equally dis
tributed between the two construction phases. Only Lower Mississippi
Valley sherds and sand tempered sherds were found in the primary
mound, while these and numerous Caddoan sherds were found in the
mound cap.
The presence of equal arm cross design elements is not completely
unknown in Marksville and affiliated Hopewell pottery (Griffin,
personal communication), but they are indeed rare. The association of
a locally made Marksville Stamped vessel with this design element
and the Caddoan sherds poses new problems. The presence of Caddoan
sherds in a peripheral Marksville mound indicates the need for further
revision of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Caddoan area sequences.
It would appear from this new evidence that alignment of Alto I with
Marksville-Hopewell by Newell and Krieger (1949: Fig. 66) was
correct.
We argue for consideration of this alignment because of the follow
ing reasons. Caddoan-like sherds were well within the mound cap or
Stage 3 portion of the mound, and were at a minimum of three feet
below the surface of the mound. McClurkan’s AD 300 (TX-265) is
compatible as to the building stage and elevation, with many Caddoan
like sherds found within the mound. Coral Snake Mound is a mixture
of local and foreign ideas—it is not pure Marksville, nor is it pure
Sabine River-Toledo Bend. The mound site itself seems to have been
the focus of human activity for a long period of time, since we have
Archaic, Marksville and Historic use of the same site. The mound cap
may well represent a “last gasp” of Marksville-inspired veneration of

the dead by descendants of the mound’s builders who, by that time, had
accepted, invented or evalued a ceramic-making tradition now known
as Caddoan.

ABSTRACT
Typological and technological studies of a large systematic collection
of flaked and ground stone artifacts indicate a considerable occupation of
the Acton Site during a transition period from late Paleo-Indian stage to
early Archaic stage. For the first time, all of the materials from this type
of site are described according to a standard system.
INTRODUCTION
Investigation of this site was undertaken by the senior author and
his wife in the spring of 1961. Initial collection was selective and con
fined to surface artifacts. By 1962 it became apparent that an un
usually high percentage (approximately 50%) of the dart points being
found were those generally held to be representative of the Paleo
Indian stage in Texas. In addition, tool forms, cores and flakes were
present in quantities potentially useful for detailed study. In the hope
of eventually affiliating some of this material with the Paleo-Indian
tools, a complete surface collection procedure was initiated and even
tually supplemented by test excavations. This report concerns analysis
of materials primarily collected from the surface of the site from 1961
through 1967; the results of limited testing; and geological interpreta
tion and correlations pertinent to this site.
While all of the authors contributed in all phases of this investiga
tion, there are areas in which each assumed primary responsibility.
Joel L. Shiner is responsible for the technological analysis of all arti
facts, Wilson W. Crook, Jr. for the geological investigation and inter
pretation, R. K. Harris for the Archaic and Neo-American points, and
Jay C. Blame for the Paleo-Indian points. Linda Harris Brown is the
artist responsible for the excellent illustrations of artifacts.
In accordance with the explicit instructions of the land holders only
the authors together with Mrs. Jerrylee Blame and Mrs. Maxine
Shiner have worked at the site during the investigation.
The De Corciova Dam is under construction down stream from the
site and the development of lakeside property and recreational facilities
terminated our investigation of the site.

THE SITE AND ITS SETTING
The Acton Site is located in east-central Hood County, Texas, on
the east side of the Brazos River and near the community of Acton.
The exact location is on file with the Department of Anthropology of
Southern Methodist University and bears the site designation
X41HD-13.
The present channel of the Brazos River is less than 0.5 miles west
of the site and a seep spring emerges within 200 yards. The site is
situated upon sand-capped low clay ridges shghtly protuding from a
general land slope which gently descends toward the south.
Most of the artifacts were found in an area about 200 yards long
and 160 yards wide and within this area all tools, flakes, cores and cul
tural debris observed were collected. This area lies within a larger
cleared field which has been cultivated for many years. The general
site surface is now one of shifting sand through which clay ridges
protrude. The generally overlying sand is relatively deep between
these ridges or high spots and completely gone or intermixed by plow
ing with the clay on the ridges.
With only one exception all surface finds of early dart points were
made where the plow had penetrated to or into the basic red clay sur
face. Many of the later types of dart points and other artifacts and
debitage were found in the same situation but the latter were also
found where some sand cover was present arid the underlying clay
had not been disturbed by cultivation. There did not appear to be any
obvious or significant concentration of artifacts or flakes in any use
fully limited area or situation within the site boundaries. In short, the
areal distribution of the generally recognized classes of artifacts, in
cluding cores, appeared homogeneous for the area studied. Despite the
above factors and the fact that the site continued to be under cultiva
tion, the senior author decided to record precise locations for each early
point found against such time that test excavations could be carried
out. Observations and experiments noted by Fitting et al. (1966: 99)
would indicate that most specimens are probably not moved far from
their original locations by cultivation or wind action. Subsequently two

ACTON SITE

47

compass bearings were secured from each early point location to two
widely separated and fixed reference points. The distance between
these reference points was measured by tape and formed the basis for
map scale. All test excavations and other site detail were similarly
mapped.
Test results
Nine test excavations measuring from 3’ by 3’ up to 6’ X 12’ were
made where sand cover remained over the clay. All tests were located
within the artifact bearing area. Standard controls and recording pro—
ceclures were followed. Excavation ‘was primarily by 6 inch levels and
4 inch screens were used.
i/
The culture-bearing sand deposit was quite thin in its seemingly
undisturbed portion. After factoring out the 6 inch to 8 inch disturbed
plow zone the mean thickness of sand deposit for all tests was only 12
inches. Only two reasonably definitive artifacts were found. One, a
notched “sinker,” was found 2 inches below the plow zone and 14
inches above the clay in test B. The other, a Plainview golondrina
basal fragment, was found in test H on the clay at a point 10 inches
below the plow zone. Occasional flakes ‘were found in the surface of
the clay and down to 5 inches below the surface. There was no evidence
observed of sand-filled cracks or fissures involving the latter. There
was a tendency for flakes and lithic debris to concentrate in the lower
2 inches of the first 6 inch level above the dense red clay but in the
overlying one or two levels, the vertical distribution appeared essen
tially homogeneous below the plow zone. The intra-level debris counts
were not significantly different between the first two to three levels
above clay in the tests.
As a general observation it would appear possible that the first sig
nificant occupation took place after the clay surface had been reduced
by exposure and other factors and a thin derived sand veneer devel
oped. The tests reveal a comparative concentration of lithic debris just
above, seldom in or under, the dense red clay. Subsequently the thick
sand deposition took place.
An alternative possibly could have the lowest concentration initially
on or in the clay surface and freed from this condition by flooding
which deposited the major sand layer.
No features were observed in excavation. Occasionally fire-altered
rock, flint, and some carbonaceous flecks were found at random depths.
Three cultivation scattered groups of fire-altered limestone occured on
the surface of the site.

GEOLOGIC ASSESSMENT OF THE SITE
In the De Cordova Bend Reservoir region, the country bedrock is a
rather massive limestone member of the Comanche series of Cretaceous
sedimentary origin. Its surface weathers into a rocky, low-grade dark
soil (in no manner comparable to the rich blackland prairies to the east
derived from the soft Austin Chalk of the Gulf series of the Creta
ceous). In nature, this supports live oak on the uplands and in the
valleys; on the slopes a tendency to heavy growth of juniper-cedar
and sumac; and otherwise native grasses. Cultivation is neglible, graz
ing being the principal agricultural pursuit, plus some feed grains;
there is also a considerable production of cedar fence-posts.
Lying west of the Balcones Fault Zone, whose southwest-northwest
trend essentially separates the higher ground of the Cretaceous forma
tions of Texas from the lower and totally different Tertiary formations
of the Gulf-Mississippi Embayment, the area is in effect an extension
of the Edwards Plateau feature to the northeastward. However, among
other things being much more a heavily cedared region, it is by no
means identical to the more classic Texas “hill country” another 150
miles southwest. Native flint ledges and nodules occur in varying qual
ity and purity in the limestone, similar but not equal to the high con
centration-variety-quality of such in the type Edwards Plateau region.
(The later Cretaceous Austin Chalk to the north and east, previously
referred to, is notable for its complete lack of flinty materials.)
Topography of the region is purely a result of gentle regional uplift
primarily since the beginning
and resultant erosional sculpture
of the Pleistocene epoch of the Quaternary and due to the work of the
Brazos River system with its tributaries, large and small. Differences
in elevation are rather impressive, with many mesas and named
“mountains” of size, but all are related to the breaks of the master
Brazos Valley.
With its headwaters far to the northwest on the High Plains, the
Brazos is a through-flowing stream on its way to the Gulf of Mexico,
being laden with a brown sandy silt even today throughout all its
lower reaches. The material is brought from far upstream, yet every
where comprises the present floodplain deposits regardless of the local
soils and formations through which the river passes.
In the former times of the alternate cut-and-fill cycles, equated with
the alternating glacial-stadial-pluvial and intergiacial-interstadial
interpluvial periods of the Pleistocene and Recent, as the river progres
sively trenched its valley ever deeper it left remnants of former flood
plains as typical alluvial terraces. These are also composed of exotic

materials, ranging from gravels of harder materials such as cobbles
and pebbles of quartzite, flints, petrified wood, petrified Cretaceous
molluscs, silicified limestone, and some ironstone-sandstone
all
obviously transported at the time of much greater flow and volume
than today; thence through a progression of yellowbuff sands, tough
yellow-buff clays, red sandy clays, and grey-tan sands. The latter com
ponents represent varying degrees of carrying-capacity at the times of
deposition.
These sandy and sandy clay soils of the Quaternary alluvial forma
tions support a natural flora quite distinct from the surrounding areas,
especially featuring a great variety of oaks other than the live oak,
which is absent here. Since the terrace surfaces are so relatively level
and so deep in alluvial materials, large areas have been cleared and
intensive agriculture practiced—particularly peanuts, peach orchards,
and of late the many legumes for hay. Such denuding of the natural
cover has allowed in many places extensive wind and water erosion,
deflating the loose dry sand surfaces as much as three-to-five feet
piling up sand drifts along fences or against windbreaks of trees
causing erosion channels, gullies, and ravines of surprising develop
ment in the apparent period of only the last 60—1 00 years.
In previous studies (see writer’s pertinent Bibliography, plus
others), it has been observed that the Red River, the Sulphur River,
the Sabine, the Trinity, the Brazos, the Leon, the Lampasas. and even
the Colorado River all more-or-less exhibit the same general north
west-to-southeast pattern of drainage towards the Gulf. Their some
what parallel courses essentially cross the same series of formations.
It is therefore not so surprising that their alluvial terrace systems
appear to be quite comparable, even to elevations above stream-grade;
when their relative lithologic, paleontologic, and even archeologic con
tents and inclusions seem to match well at the different levels, the pre
viously suggested “correlations” deserve serious consideration (Slaugh
ter, etal., 1962, pp. 5—11; Crook and Harris 1957, pp. 37—54).
A common phenomenon among the terrace systems of these streams
is the difference above-and-below the crossing of the Balcones Fault
line. As specific examples, at Dallas on the Trinity to the northeast
of De Cordova, Waco on the Brazos downstream, and Austin on the
Colorado to the southwest
all at the cut-through of the softer
Austin Chalk
there are ‘well-developed 5-terrace sequences appar
ently dating back to the Early Pleistocene (Slaughter, et al., 1962).
These are most suggestive of the 5-terrace sequence of the Red River
so carefully studied and described in its middle reaches in Northern
Louisiana (Fisk, 1938 and 1940).

On the other hand, above the Balcones line, despite the depth of the
Bedrock valley-trench there appears to be only the last or latest two
terraces present (or preserved) from the standard sequence. The writer
has personally observed this situation upstream on all three major
forks of the Trinity; at the Acton Site subject of this paper, at the
Possum Kingdom Reservoir, and on the Clear Fork of the Brazos near
Abilene even further upstream (Crook, 1955); on the Leon upstream
at North Fort Hood; and on the Colorado (and its tributaries, the
Llano and San Saba) npstream near Brady and Goolbusk, and near
Junction and Menard. Quinn, when paleontologist for the Bureau of
Economic Geology for Texas and operating out of Austin, was ever
looking for extinct Late Pleistocene fossil bone occurrences; his field
of research was more often than not above the fault line to the north
and west, and he became so imprecsed with this almost universal cir
cumstance (though he was only interested in the higher or second
terrace where his specimens occurred), that he incorrectly ventured
a paper suggesting that ALL Texas river terraces were of Sangamon
Interglacial vintage.
Even today, in the confusion over the identification and division of
the Late Pleistocene, no one is quite sure about the last “Interglacial”
or “major interstadial”
but in Quinn’s time, the fauna was attrib
uted to “Sangamon.”
All of which suggests that the major stream-systems were present
upon the worn-down Tertiary surface of Texas before the start of the
Pleistocene uplift. Their courses were primarily across the vast Coastal
Plain, but their head-waters had at least incised across the soft Austin
Chalk and were nibbling into the Comanche series. Thus, with reju
venation by both uplift and increased precipitation, they were able to
completely record the progressive levels of cut-and-fill, even through
the Austin Chalk; and after perhaps a major cutting-period through
most of Pleistocene time across the Comanche series, were only able
to retain the Late Pleistocene despositions above the fault line, while
gnawing headward to this day into the Permian Basin and High Plains
formations.
The Acton archeological site in the De Cordova Bend area is located
in precisely such a region on the Brazos above the Balcones line, as
discussed above. As impressive as the valley-relief is, only the present
floodplain, Recent, and Late Pleistocene alluviations are preserved as
terrace remnants. They are however, as high and massive as their
conterparts in the complete total sequence downstream at Waco, and
almost completely identical as to sequence, Ethology, and inclusions.
Further upstream in this vein, the writer’s studies of such High

It is within the topmost five feet of the highest terrace at Acton
that the archeological site occurs in p!ace. Whether exposed by exca

associated with the ancient surface, and perhaps some inches into, of
and also occur upwards into the
the underlying red sandy clay
basal 18 inches or so of the over-lying tan-gray sands.
Based upon previous correlations, the Acton Site appears to be nearly
identical in context with the other river system terrace sequences. The
Recent. “overlay” of red sandy clay, followed by even later
late
tan-gray sands, on top of the latest sloped-off Pleistocene terrace de
posits is standard. The in-place position is precisely the same. Nowhere
is there positive evidence of anything but the existing fauna of the
last 8,000—10,000 years. And everywhere, including Acton, there is evi
dence of a naturally-buried Early Archaic human culture at this level;
the difference at Acton being only that while it includes all expectable
items of comparable types; there is indeed a higher (55%) occurrence
of Paleo-type projectile points vs. the usual (5—10%) of same in sim
ilar combination and contexts at Dallas and Waco, in preciely the
same geologic provenience (Crook and Harris, 1955).
Upon inspection, there is little doubt of the correspondence. A solu
tion is that the upper-middle reaches of the Brazos system were in
more direct contact at Acton with the High Plains-oriented Palco
hunters coming downstream into the Early Archaic areas about 8,000—
10,000 years ago, along the through-flowing Brazos. Neighboring
stream-systems such as the Leon River to the south, or the Trinity to
the north, received the High Plains “influence” to a lesser degree,
reflecting a much-reduced occurrence of such Paleo points at “contact.”
There is only one radiocarbon date available for this period, from the
basal 12 inches of the universal overlying tan-gray sands at Woods
Pit near Dallas on the Trinity, which falls right at ca. 6,000 years ago.

Therefore, everything else must fall earlier (Crook and Harris, 1961)!
The surface occupation of the red sandy clay must have consumed
some extensive period, based upon the debris and many sites on all
such related stream systems. Site after site exhibits this same sequence
and occurrence. Based upon the Dallas-area Wood Pit date of ca.
6,000 B. P. for the lowest foot of the tan-gray sands (deposited 50—60
feet above present stream-grade), it is not unlikely that the sands repre
sent a warm-dry period of the last high sea level and alluvial deposition
connected with the theoretical Hypsi-Alti-Thermal period postulated
by various authorities from 6,500—4,500 years ago.
If so, there would be no “problem.”
1. The red clay surface period might easily correspond to the minor
Recent glacial readvarice recorded as the “Longdraw” in the U. S.
Rockies and the type-site Cochrane moraine below James Bay south
of the Hudson Bay embayment, already radiocarbon dated at ca. 6,800
B. P. This interruption may well have taken place in the period 7,500—
6,500 years ago.
2. Objects left on the red clay surface over an extended period
might penetrate into same by human activities such as fire-pit digging,
posthole digging, refuse pits, burials, etc.; and by non-human activities
such as erosional drop-down, gullies and ravines, root-action, gophertunnels, and tree-stumping.
3. Even so, such occurrences must be of an age of Ca. 6,500—9,500
years ago.
4. Likewise, the tan-gray sands period of deposition seems to fall
in the estimated 6,500—4,500 years ago period (Slaughter, et al., 1962).
5. By known radiocarbon dates, the Late-Paleo “Portales Complex”
in adjacent New Mexico is only ca. 6,000 years old (with questionable,
undistinguished fauna)
a number of the varied “Yuma” Paleo
sites on the High Plains range by radiocarbon dates from ca. 6,500 to
9,500 years ago
and by many radiocarbon datings, the “Early
Archaic” of the Midwest, Southeast, Mexico, Canada, and elsewhere
likewise range up to 11,000 years ago. A possible overlap and “contact”
is not at all difficult to imagine.
Acton seems to meet all the requirements to comply with the several
possibilities made possible by the above circumstance and its mixture
of inclusions. Its geologic provenience is strikingly identical to all
other known buried Archaic sites in the alluvial terraces of the Texas
rivers.
The Brazos River has been cutting deeply into the Comanche lime
stone from the De Cordova Bend dam location back upstream past the
Acton Site location since at least the inception of Pleistocene time

(Fig. 1 and 2). The valley impinges against an almost cliff-like wall
of same throughout the horseshoe-shaped “bend”
nearly west
below the Acton Site, south-southwest at the tip of the bend, and al
most east-southeast at the dam. The tops of the cliffs correspond to the
local uplands.
Inside the bend, like a peninsula pointed southward, lies a lower
high ground composed of the alluvial terrace sequence described,
dropping off in progressive slopes towards the river.
Basically, there is a limestone bedrock channel-cut of about 10—I S
feet deep in which the stream presently runs, braided here and there
at low water with sand-bars. Above this the floodplain deposits or T-O
terrace cap the limestone with about 10 feet of tan-gray sand; this
buried limestone surface apparently represents the base-level of the
last previous major valley-cut.
Where preserved, there is a T- 1 terrace with its surface some 10 feet
higher. It is composed of some 5 feet of tan-gray sand on top, with up
to 10 feet of red sandy clay beneath where exposures are available.
No definite human artifacts have come from this terrace as yet in the
Acton investigations, but there are numerous tiny flint flakes upon its
surface here and there that are quite suggestive of the typical debris
of late Neo-Indian arrowpoint manufacture and in sharp contrast with
the heavy rubble and flaked cobble debris of typical Archaic occupa
tions. The surface of the T-1 terraces of all Texas rivers and their
similar version of the tan-gray sands normally exhibit such Neo
Indian presence.
Above this is the T-2 terrace, comprising the bulk of the high ground
“peninsula” within the bend. At its highest it is approximately 70 feet
above present stream-grade, some 40 feet above the T-1 surface. On
the slopes, bedrock limestone is exposed for 20—25 feet above the T-1
surface, capped by 15—20 feet of alluvial materials. This outcrop of the
bedrock bears numerous seep springs from the groundwater flow pene
trating from the broad areas above and then following this resistant
formation to the escape point. The seep-level is so constant that willows
and cottonwoods are present even at such an altitude above the present
river.
It would appear that the top of this limestone exposure represents
the level of the next older major valley-cut. The alluviation that fol
lowecl laid down first a gravel formation as earlier briefly described,
of up to 10 feet in thickness, capped by a distinct cemented zone 12—18
inches thick. Where minor gravel operations have been initiated,
blocks of this cemented capping have been discarded on all sides. The
fragmentary and fossil inclusions of proboscidian tusks (mammoth or

mastodon?), camel, horse, and other bones and teeth leave little doubt
of the Late Pleistocene period of provenience
in common with al
most any other Texas river system T-2 terrace composition. Above this,
varying from exposure-to-exposure, especially as more sloped-off to
wards the valley by subsequent erosion or more fully preserved in
the higher parts of the terrace, lie 3 to 5 feet of yellow-buff sand; then
5 to 8 feet of yellow-buff clays including definite caliche nodular con
cretions; and above this, almost universally a late (actually T-1 age)
“veneer” of 3—S feet of red sandy clay overlain by 3—5 feet of tan-gray
sands.
It would seem that the T- 1 period of deposition was able to overflow
the T-2 terrace surface
at least at its maximum flooding period and
nearest the river where erosional slope-off was most pronounced
before finishing with a deeper deposit below as the T-1 basic fill. This
phenomenon is also in common with the other Texas river terrace
systems earlier discussed (Crook, 1961). The matrix involved is in all
respects identical with the red sandy clay and tan-gray sands below.
At the Acton archeological site itself, test excavations, plus erosion
and deflation due to the combined activities of agriculture, land-clear
ing, and shallow bull-dozing for gravel have produced the following
results:
1. In places, the original surface essentially persists; here the tangray sands are about 5 feet in thickness; excavations here produce
flakes and debris, plus some tools (including one Paleo-Indian type)
in the basal 12 to 18 inches of the sands. However, the real concentra
tion of artifacts, plus all expectable Archaic types and many Paleo
Indian projectile points, appear to be concentrated just above the

truly massive accumulations. Nonetheless, these are remarkably stand

PALEO POINTS
Typologically speaking 77 of the dart points from the Acton Site
exhibit attributes common to Paleo-Indian projectile points. Of this
number 50 can be classified as presently recognized types and subtypes
in the Plainview, Plainview golondrina, Meserve, Angostura and San
Patrice categories.
Plainview Points
Some 30 specimens are classified as Plainview and Plainview go/on
drina. This group is primarily composed of basal fragments but in
cludes two complete points and two medial-distal sections of points.
All of the bases present are concave. The lateral outlines of these points
can be described as essentially parallel-sided with minor variations
including slightly expanded midsections and slightly expanded bases,
or both. The edges of the distal ends or tips of the specimens are convex.
Although the general classification is based on a sum of attributes,
to facilitate description, the Plainview points have been divided into
four subgroups or forms, wherein similarities in the lateral outlines of
the proximal sections starting at the base are the basis for selective
grouping. The variation in proximal form is often very slight but is
utilized primarily because basal fragments predominate This range of
variation is recognized within Plainview as described by Krieger
(1947: 939—942) and Suhm, Krieger and Jeiks (1954: 472). Our par
ticular approach is adapted from that used by Baker, Campbell, and
Evans (1957: 3—7) in describing the large series of Plainview points
from the Nall site The four forms are 1 Points with lateral edges
essentially straight and parallel at the base (5 specimens); 2. Points
with lateral edges slightly converging for a short distance above the
base then becoming straight and parallel (1 specimen); 3. Points with
the lateral edges slightly converging above the base then turning out
ward in a smooth arc (5 specimens); 4. Points with the lateral edges

with the 3 or 4 to 1 ratio reported for the type
site specimens (Krieger,
1947: 942). Examination of secondary flaking
and longitudinal sec
tion makes it probable this specimen has been
re-pointed. All speci
mens are smoothed in the basal concavity
and on the lateral edges.
One specimen also shows double lateral-medial
basal facets (Epstein,
1963b:189). The mean basal concavity dept
h is 3 mm. (range 1—5
mm.). (Approximate measurements are mad
e where damage is light.)
Mean basal width is 21 mm. (range 20—23
mm.). Mean maximum
thickness is 7 mm. on two specimens. Leng
th of the repointed speci
men (Fig. 3, a) is 40 mm.

at the base. There is

Form 3. (Fig. 3, f and g) Form 3 points
are slightly constricted
between base and mid-section. Five basal secti
ons are in form 3; none
are complete through the mid-section. All
show fine bifacial lateral
edge retouch and smoothing of the lower later
al edges and basal con
cavities. The mean basal concavity depth is 2.5
mm. (range 2—3 mm.);
mean basal width 20 mm. (range 18—21 mm.
).
Form 4. (Fig. 3, d, j and n) Form 4 points are
slightly contracted
at the base. None of the ten specimens in this
form are complete. Two
specimens are distally modified. One (Fig. 3,
d) has a convex-bit (end
scraper form) and one (Fig. 3, j) a straight-b
it (gouge form). The
latter also has one lateral edge removed by
a proximal-distal blow
(Epstein, 1963b: 189). All lower lateral edge
s are smoothed but four
specimens are not noticeably smoothed in the
basal concavity. Mean
basal concavity depth on nine specimens is 3 mm.
(range 2—5 mm.).
Mean basal width on eight specimens is 20 mm.
(range 17—22 mm.).
Two distinctive specimens are classified as Plain
view despite their
lack of basal sections. Both have lower later
al edge smoothing. The
lateral edges are approximately straight and
parallel. Maximum
widths are 21.7 mm. (Fig. 3, k) and 24 mm.
Respective maximum
thicknesses are 6.6 mm. and 7.0 mm.
Using a discussion by Wormington (1957: 103—1
08) as guidance
the general flaking technique on the Plainview
and other early points
from this site can best be characterized as skill
ful but irregular in
pattern. Most specimens of all types show roug
hly parallel horizontal
to irregular shallow flaking. Some elements of
the more classic tech
niques are pre’sent but seldom appear to be emp
loyed systematically
on both faces of a given point. Since basal fragm
ents are predominant,

Plainview-like and Altered Plainview

edges. All are
bifacially thinned from the basal edge with one or both faces
showing

The first two have smoothed basal curves. Both appear compl

bifacially reworked above this area and retain only
a remnant of
smoothed lower lateral edge. One (Fig. 3, c) remains a project
ile point
after irregular reworking but the other is too short to assess.
The last two (Fig. 3, 1 and m) are not smoothed in basal curve
or
lateral edges. In the proximal section lateral edges are
essentially
straight and parallel but they curve inward abruptly in the
mid-section
and the profile here is asymmetrical. Cross sections of the broken
distal
ends are essentially lenticular with steep bifacial lateral-medial
flaking.
These probably were drills or perforators and similar specim
ens occur
on sites with reasonably large Plainview assemblages (Baker
et al.,
1957; Alexander, 1963; Crawford, 1965).
Plainview Variant

retouched and smoothed lower lateral edges. On two, (Fig. 4, a and e)
these edges are parallel from the basal corners (form 1) and on the
other two (Fig. 4, c) expand very slightly (form 4). All four have
smoothed basal concavities; two (Fig. 4, a, and e) exhibit double
lateral-medial proximal facets (Epstein, 1963b: 189). Bifacial basal
thinning appears typical of Plainview in this site. Only one point
(Fig. 4, a) displays irregular edge flaking and asymmetry in the
beveled portion to a degree that contrasts obviously with the well
formed base. Mean maximum thickness is 6.6 mm. (range 5.8—7.3
mm.); mean maximum basal width on three specimens is 21.2 mm.
(range 20.5—21.8mm.).
The next three specimens have straight to convex smoothed lower
lateral edges. One is broken across the lower base; the other two have
smoothed concave bases. On all three the lateral edges diverge too
strongly from the base to strictly be classified as Plainview in basal
outline. All Acton Site Plainview-like specimens which would exceed
a 3 mm. difference between basal and maximum width (Krieger, 1947:

ACTON SITE

63

939) presently are not classified as Plainview. Basal thinning is bifacial
on two of these points. Each has one major thinning flake scar on one
face and short multiple thinning scars on the other face. Although all
would appear to have approximately similar basal widths, the only
measurable base (Fig. 4, b) is 16mm. wide.
The eighth specimen (Fig. 4, d) has been distally modified into a
convex bit scraper form. The angular basal concavity is not typical of
Plainview nor is the essentially flat surface of one face. The base was
bifacially thinned by removing one central conchoidal flake from each
face and three or four shorter retouch flakes. Lower lateral edge re
touch is unifacial on alternate right edges. These edges and the basal
concavity are smoothed. The lower lateral edges diverge from the
basal corners. Basal width is 24.6 mm.
The next four specimens closely resemble each other but contrast
with Plainview and the rest of the Acton Site points. None of them
retain lower lateral edges. On two points (Fig. 4, f) these have been
removed by proximal-distal blows (Epstein, 1963b: 189). What re
mains of their basal concavities is smoothed. The third specimen is a
portion of mid-section which retains the central basal thinning flake
scars and a smoothed portion of lateral edge. The opposite edge shows
a distal-proximal burin facet (Epstein, 1963b: 187). The fourth is a
distal end. These four fragments are essentially flat to only slightly
convex across the face and contrast sharply with most Plainview speci
mens in that respect. Beveling is short, steep and angular, producing
a straight-sided rhomboidal cross section. Bifacial basal thinning scars
indicate one to three major central flakes were removed from three
specimens. All four remarkably match corresponding sections of a
plastic cast of Specimen X illustrated by Suhm et al., (1954, Plate
104). They also match a similar specimen in the R. K. Harris collec
tion from Lamar County, Texas. Mean maximum thickness is 6.9 mm.
(range 6.8—7.0 mm.).
The last point (Fig. 4, h) has been ground in the basal concavity
but lateral edges have been removed by proximal-distal blows (Ep
stein, 1963b: 189). It is not clearly beveled but extensive secondary
and retouch flaking is evident on the right edge. Basal thinning is bi
facial with one flute-like central scar and two shorter, and flanking,
secondary flake scars on each face.
It is quite possible that some of the shorter basal portions classified
under Plainview and Plainview golondrina may have been beveled in
the missing distal sections. The latter variety, especially, often has
basal attributes comparable to the beveled points which do not appear
to be reworked Plainviews.

lEXAS AEU±IEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

It is interesting that six points in the “Meserve” category exhibit
burin facets. Epstein’s (1963b: 192) observation of the high proportion
of such facets on “Meserve” type points as compared with other Paleo
Indian types is supported by the situation at Acton.
In the original definition by Davis (Bell and Hall, 1953: 6—7) the
“Meserve” type included both reworked Plainview points and points
which may have been reworked. Subsequently Suhm and Jelks (1962:
217) suggested that two types may be represented. We tend to concur
in the latter. Unfortunately adequate objective data to enable reliable
distinction between the two or more types are lacking. Essentially we
cannot reliably establish whether or not the beveling was done by the
original makers or their contemporaries. We suspect it usually was;
sometimes as part of the original design and sometimes as a modifica
tion or repair on Plainview points.
Meserve Variant
This one specimen (Fig. 4, g) has distal edges that are steeply
beveled to the right and serrated like Dalton. General face flaking pat
tern is irregular on one face and oblique on the other. Lower lateral
edges are essentially parallel, bifacially retouched and smoothed. Bi
facial basal thinning was done by removing seven or eight short flakes
to form a steep bevel on one face. The opposite face was thinned by
removing two longer central flakes and four short retouch flakes. The
basal edge is slightly convex and not smoothed. Length 52.0 mm.;
basal width 22.3 nun.; thickness 7.5 rum.
Scottsbluff
Two medial-distal sections (Fig. 5, b and d) are classified as Scotts
bluff (Suhm and Jeiks, 1962). Both exhibit the thick beautifully sym
metrical cross section distinctive in this type. Lateral edges are gently
convex in the manner of Scottsbluff I (Wormington, 1957, Fig. 70)
and are bifacially edge retouched. Similar but complete points from
N. Central Texas are illustrated by Crook and Harris (1955, Plate 12).
One Acton specimen (Fig. 5, b) has received a new tip and base at a
much later time as evidenced by partial removal of otherwise uni
formly heavy patina. Both specimens are skillfully flaked in a some
what irregular pattern.
San Patrice
One San Patrice point (Fig. 5, c) was found at the Acton Site. This
specimen appears to be the yery short stemmed variety described and
illustrated by Webb (1946, Plate 1, #11, #13) and subsequently

of 5945 ± 200 B. P. for a Carroliton Focus site which contained two
San Patrice points.
Angostura
Four points (illustrated by Fig. 5, a and e) fit the type description
(Suhm etai., 1954) as it is limited to Texas specimens. One asymmetri
cal specimen appears entirely reworked above the basal portion and
one is badly spalled, probably by thermal action. Bases are straight to
slightly concave and three are smoothed on the basal edge. Lateral
edges are smoothed on all four and curve inward below the mid-section
on three. One distal section (Fig. 5, e) is alternately beveled to the

18.4mm.). Two measurable points are 22.5 mm. and
(range 14.5
23.4 mm. wide at the widest point. Maximum thickness of one is
8.5 mm.
One specimen (Fig. 5, e) has a deposit of white stained red clay
tightly adhering to one surface. This deposit appears indicative of long
and direct contact with the basic red clay. In situ flakes showing such
a limey deposit invariably were found directly on the red clay in
moist situations.
Lerma-like
This proximal fragment has lateral edges which expand rapidly
from the narrow and slightly convex basal end. Lateral edges are
smoothed and bifacially retouched. One face shows short lateral-medial
flaking forming a definite medial ridge.
Although a fragmentary specimen, the principal contrast with the
type description (Suhm et al., 1954) lies in the smoothed edges of this
specimen. Epstein (1 963a 117) reports Lerma points and Clear Fork
gouges from Period 1 at Damp Cave and suggests a possible starting
date of B.C. 7000 for this period.
At the Devils Mouth Site Johnson (1964: 83) describes a consecu
tive three stratum sequence in which a Lerma-like point follows Plainview goloncirina and precedes Angostura. Johnson (ibid.: 91) as
signs all three to a late Paleo-Indian time horizon, about 6000 B.C.
(ibid.: 97).
Untyped Paleo-Indian points
There are twenty untyped specimens which show stylistic attributes
common to Paleo-Indian points. Two specimens are essentially com
plete, eleven are basal fragments and seven are mid-section and tip
fragments.
Six of the basal sections, including the two points, show the usual
Plainview attributes previously described. However, their lower lateral
edges diverge from the basal corners to a greater degree than presently
allowable for Plainview. The larger point (Fig. 5, f) also twists grad
ually to the left from the basal corners to the tip. This series could
represent a continuum with Plainview.
The remaining seven fragments with some part of the basal portion

b7

intact vary from flaring through straight to slightly contrac
ted at the
base. All show lateral and/or basal concavity smooth
ing and longi
tudinal thinning.
Two of the medial-distal sections are beveled to the right
and one of
these is almost a carbon copy of the corresponding
area of (Fig. 3, o)
the Plainview variant. Two more of these specimens
have been care
fully modified on one end. One has a convex-bit scraper
edge and one
a concave-bit gouge edge. Both are skillfully flaked and
probably were
originally Paleo-Indian in style and modified by the origina
l makers.
Such modifications on typeable points at the Acton Site
are confined to
the Paleo-Indian points. All of the above and the
remaining three
specimens show flaking and shape in outline and cross-s
ection that are
more common to early points from this site.
Data from mapping.
One Plainview point and one Angostura point were

apart. Subsequent testing revealed no other diagnostic

One group of five points could be enclosed in a circle

The balance of the recorded points were 24 or more

Two parts of the same Plainview point (Fig. 3, n)

is well
patinated. One section was recovered downslope where
there is a clay

was found
upslope on dense red clay where the sand is now gone.
From plotting points on a map of the site, no clustering
of typeable
points is recognized.
Lithic sources
Virtually all of the collected lithic material appears
similar to that
found in local river cobbles and sandstone exposures.
Nine of the early
points are not made from strictly local material. Six
of these are made
from the blue-gray flint common to central Texas.
The nearest good
source we know of is about 75 miles south of the Acton
Site and on the
Leon River. No alibates material was found.

Derived chronology
The temporal estimates for the initial occupation at the Acton Site
are largely inferred from the more recent c-I 4 data concerning Plainview points in Texas sites. James H. Word (personal communication)
reports C-14 dates of 6820—7 100 B.C. and 6850—7310 B.C. (TX 128
and TX 129, Tamers et aL, 1964) for the Baker Shelter in Val Verde
County. At Bonfire Shelter in Comstock County (Dibble and Lorrain,
1968, 33) th edate is 10,230 ± 160 years (TX 153, Pearson et al.,
1965). Willey (1966: 46) cites Agogino concerning a C-14 date of
7320 B.C. for a Plainview-Meserve layer in a Brazos River shelter near
Waco, Texas. The latter date appears especially pertinent since the
Acton Site is approximately 65 miles above Waco on the same river.
Estimates for the general terminating dates for Plainview have been
altered by other data accumulated since 1954. Currently, Story
(Suhm) suspects that about 6,000 B.C. may be a more accurate termi
nal date for Texas specimens (personal communication).
It would appear that, stylistically, the Acton Site Plainview points
would represent an initial late Paleo-Indian occupation and that,
chronologically, this occupation roughly should date from 6,000 to
7,000 B.C.
The balance of the early point types from Acton probably are not
yet sufficiently defined in chronological range to support any further
intrasite refinement of priority between types. It is entirely possible
that some are essentially contemporaneous at Acton. Most would
seem to terminate during the early Archaic in Texas. The youngest of
these may be San Patrice which Webb (1946: 15—17) believed could
extend into a comparatively late Archaic horizon in Louisiana.
Functional Discussion
No limited functional role can be established for the Acton Site
early points. Such points usually are held to represent specialized
big game hunting in the late-Pleistocene, since they are found with

AU1Oi’ 11t.

the remains of extinct mega-fauna or in corresponding stratigraphic
situations. At the Acton Site apparently there was no preservation of
any kind of vertebrate remains and the availability of big game is not
established. There are some indications that any presumed big game
orientation is, at least, undergoing change. The noted skillful modifica
tion of early style points into special end scraper and gouge forms
could indicate this changing orientation. Since these alterations were
confined to the early points they appear to be a contemporary activity
and contrast with general high plains Paleo-Indian practice. The maxi
mum use of local lithic sources of mediocre quality apparently is not a
common trait of the earlier western Paleo-Indian tradition, particu
larly when select flint sources were available within reasonable
distances.
The concentration of such a large number of early points in a limited
area is uncommon. A kill-site can show a similar concentration but
there is nothing recognizable in a terrain-oriented sense to suggest this
possibility. There would, however, appear to be a repeated use of a
limited area predicated on camping and refurbishing activity. A high
proportion of basal fragments is generally held to indicate a re-hafting
(camp) function.
In total these indications seem to point toward an exploitation of
local environment that is more sedentary in nature than is normally
expected from big game hunting Paleo-Indians. They quite possibly
indicate an adaptation to changing, or changed, food source and en
vironment or economic pattern.
ARCHAIC POINTS
This class of artifact is usually referred to as a dart point because of
its weight and length—thus, probably it was used with the throwing
stick or atlati. These dart points are considerably heavier than the
arrow points used with the bow and arrow, and are made mostly by
percussion chipping. Some overlapping of size takes place between the
dart and arrow points; however, the arrow points which are usually
small, thin, and light, are made by pressure flaking. Some of the small
dart points found with arrow points were probably used on arrow
shafts, thus making it difficult to establish exact criteria.

and the stem.
The analysis of the archaic dart points from the Acton Site shows

the stem “sometimes smoothed.” Nine of the 12 specimens (75%)
from Acton have smooth lateral edges or bases. In the Texas Hand
book, the estimated age is possibly from about the time of Christ to
1000 A.D. The high percentage of smoothed bases and lateral edges at
Acton would seem to place this type in early Archaic. Also, the Darl
Type occurs in the Carrollton Focus, in small numbers, probably as
trade points (see two C-14 dates under Netsinkers in this paper).
Martindale (2 specimens, Fig. 6, c)
A description of this type is found in the Texas Handbook (Suhm,
etal., 1954: 446).
Nolan (3 specimens, Fig. 6, e)
A description of this type is found in the Texas Handbook (Suhm,
et al., 1954: 458). In this description, they do not mention smoothing
of the lateral edges of this type. Two of the specimens have some
smoothing of the lateral edges.
Pedernales (5 specimens, Fig. 6, d)
The description of this type is found in the Texas Handbook (Suhm,
et aL, 1954: 468). In this description, they state that the stem of this
type is rarely ever smoothed. Three of the 5 specimens from Acton
have smoothed lateral edges, and two of these have smoothed bases.
Travis (1 specimen, Fig. 6, g)
A description of this type is given in the Texas Handbook (Suhm,
et al., 1954: 484). The one specimen from Acton fits the description.
Wheeler Leaf (2 specimens, Fig. 6, j)
This type occurs in the Carroilton Focus of the Trinity Aspect,
ranking third in percentage in point types of this focus (Crook and
Harris, 1954: 3). The body is usually lon.g and narrow, and there is
no stem. The base is sometimes straight, at other times, convex or
concave. Where bifacing has not been completed, the bulb of per
cussion may still be faintly seen on some specimens. Most of these
pieces appear to be made from blades. Chipping is sometimes fine
pressure flaking, resembling Paleo flaking, but on some specimens
only percussion flaking is present. Many specimens have flaws develop
during chipping—thus causing the piece to be abandoned. It is the
opinion of Crook and Harris that this type is probably a preform for
making either Paleo or Archaic points. The illustrated specimen (Fig.
6, j) from Acton appears to be an unfinished Paleo point in which a

flaw developed near the distal end. There is some small evidence of
smoothing of the lateral edges near the base.
Varia (2 specimens, Fig. 6, f)
These two specimens are very, very similar, and cannot be placed in
any known type. The body of these points is triangular, with straight
to slightly convex edges between the distal end and the shoulders.
The shoulders are very weak. The stem, which is about 1/3 the length
of the entire point, has slightly concave lateral edges, which have been
smoothed. The bases are concave. Both specimens have some fine
pressure flaking, resembling Paleo flaking, in some areas. In other
areas some percussion flaking is present. On both specimens, the edges
of the body are serrated. The maximum length of the two specimens
is about 50 mm., and the maximum width is 22 mm. LeRoy Johnson
(1964: Fig. 17, J) illustrates a specimen which he calls a “miscellane
ous Paleo-Indian point.” The two specimens from Acton somewhat
resemble his specimen, but there are some differences. Until more
specimens of this type are found in situ, it is not clear whether the
point belongs to the Paleo or Archaic period.
The above named specimens are types found in the Edwards Plateau
Aspect, Archaic Stage and the Carroilton Focus, Trinity Aspect. Timewise, they seem to be dated around 4000 to 3000 B.C. and fit well with
the two C- 14 dates for Carrollton Focus discussed in this paper, under
Netsinkers or Atlati weights.
LATE ARCHAIC POINTS

Fifteen specimens from Acton seem to belong to the late Archaic
period. These dart point types are discussed below.
Edgewood (3 specimens, Fig. 7, a)
These specimens fit the descriptions given in the Texas Handbook
(Suhm,etal., 1954: 418).
Evans-variant (1 specimen, Fig. 7, b)
This specimen is a variant of the Evans point found in Late Archaic
Sites in Louisiana (H. F. Gregory, personal communication 1968).
The Evans type has been described by Ford and Webb (1956: 64).
The difference between the description by Ford and Webb, and this
variant, is in the base. This variant has one or two flakes removed
across the base—from each side.

ACTON SITE

Yarbrough (5 specimens, Fig. 7, g)
A description of this type is given in the Texas Handbook (Suhm,
et ci., 1954), and the specimens from Acton fit well within the
description.
All of the specimens in the Acton Site, belonging to Late Archaic,
appear to have been in use from roughly 1000 B.C. to around 500 A.D.
It is entirely possible that some of these Late Archaic tool types may
have also extended into the Neo-American period; however, only
further excavation can determine this fact.
Judging from the scarcity of certain projectile point types, and
other diagnostic tools such as small end-scrapers. drills or perforators,
occupation during the Late Archaic period was much lighter than the
preceding Early Archaic period.
NEO-AMERICAN POINTS
A total of 10 specimens of this type of projectile point have been
recovered from the Acton Site. Five of the 10 specimens can be typed.
The other 5 specimens are too fragmentary to be typed. As a group,
the arrow points are relatively small and thin, with pointed distal ends,
and well defined stems. They are all made from local cherts and flints
found along the Brazos River. Based primarily on variations in outline,
the five tvpeable specimens are grouped into three well known types:
Clifton, Perdiz and Scallorn, all of which are usually found in Neo
American Sites.
Cliffton (1 specimen)
This one specimen has a triangular body with convex lateral edges,
and a contracting stem. A small part of the distal end is broken off,
but the length was probably about 30 mm. The maximum width is
20 mm., and the stem length is 3 mm. These dimensions fit well within
the Clifton Type (Suhm, et ci., 1954: 496, Plate 127 D and E).
Perdiz (2 specimens)
This type has contracting stems and triangular bodies, with straight
to slightly concave lateral edges. The shoulders are prominent with
sharp barbs. The maximum length of 30 mm. and the maximum width
of 21 mm. fit well within this type (Suhm, et ai., 1954: 504, Plate
131 C-E).
Scallorn (2 specimens)
Each of these specimens has an expanding short stem, and a some-

76

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

what long, triangular body, with slightly concave lateral edges. Small,
fine serrations occur along the lateral edges. The maximum length of
33 mm. and maximum width of 19 mm. of the specim€ns fits well
within this type (Suhm, et al., 1954: 506, Plate 132 A-C).
The number of specimens of arrow points found at the Acton Site is
very low, and no other tools of the Neo-American period have been
found. This would indicate that during the Neo-American period, this
site had little or no occupation. In many of the sandy fields along the
Brazos River, one may find occasional arrow points probably lost in
hunting, with no signs however, of a village site in the area of the finds.
OTHER ARTIFACTS OF FLAKED STONE
Tools other than projectile points do not offer much material for
comparison and discussion since they have not been studied syste
matically by more than a very few workers in this part of North
America. There is such a confusion in the terminology of scrapers and
bifaces as well as some other tools that we have adopted a slightly
modified European system. We see no advantages to the outmoded
local systems that employ such terminology as “scraper type D-2” or
“Jonesville knife.” We deplore the setting up of new typological
systems or names based on small collections and highly recommend
the use of this system which is in use in most of the world outside of
the United States.

SCRAPERS

This broad category of tools is divided into seven types plus a group
of non-conformable specimens. Before this collection was examined,
we had some slight reservations about the applicability of the so-called
European terminology. Now, there remains no such concern, for these
artifacts respond remarkably well.
The key to scraper classification is to orient the tool with the proxi
mal end of the flake or blade nearest the viewer and the bulbar side
down. Thus, end-scrapers will have the majority of the retouch at the
distal end of the flake or blade and side scrapers will show the retouch
on one side or the other. We were unable to discover any significance
in separating straight from convex edges among the side scrapers.
Concave (hollow) scrapers appear to be a distinct type.
In general, 60% of the scrapers were made on cortex pieces. Less
than 2% are on blades and 4% are on cores. More than 42% of the
scrapers have had the bulb of percussion chipped away or reduced by

flat retouch. Flakes with flat retouch along a thin edge have not been
included among the scrapers but are classified as retouched flakes.
Side scraper (72 specimens)
Side scrapers show regular percus3ion retouch along all or most of
one edge and the retouch is unifacial. Secondary retouch consisting of
smaller, shorter flakes, smooth out the bit (Fig. 8, a). The working
edge is essentially parallel to the axis of the flake, and that edge is
straight to convex. Mean length is 60 mm.
End-scraper (58 specimens)
The working edge is always convex, usually at the distal end of the
flake or blade, but occasionally appears at the proximal end. The
angles of the cutting edges vary considerably and the artifact is longer
than it is wide. Mean length is 47 mm. considerably smaller than that
of the side scrapers (Fig. 8, b).
Transverse scrapers (29 specimens)
This tool is similar to an. end scraper, but is wider than it is long; in
other words, it is fan-shaped with a flatter curve. Mean length is 40
mm. and mean width is 54 mm. (Fig. 8, d).

79

ACTON SITE

Concave scrapers (25 specimens)
These are not spokeshaves because of the large diameter of the
working edge. Working edges face from 45° toward the proximal end,
through parallel to the long axis, to 45° toward the distal end of the
flake. Mean length is 63 mm. (Fig. 8, c).
I’vlultiple edge scrapers (81 specimens)
Several varieties are included here: scrapers with two edges (21);
scrapers with two edges that meet in a distinct point located 45° off
the main axis, sometimes called dejetd (34); side-end scrapers (18);
and end-scrapers on a retouched piece (7). The latter show strong
retouch along one or both lateral edges of the end-scraper (Fig. 8, e
andf).
Oblique scrapers (22 specimens)
The working edge resembles that of a side scraper, but is placed
approximately 45° off the main axis of the flake. This category does
not include the concave scrapers. Mean length is 46 mm. (Fig. 8, g).
Core scrapers (12 specimens)
These tools are difficult to recognize unless one is an experienced
flint worker. The working edge is that of a scraper and is not just
corrective core trimming. Corrective core retouch consists of fine per
cussion work, usually of flakes up to 5 mm. in length, which removes
the platform overhang. A core scraper must have an edge similar to
that described for a side scraper. Concave and convex edges are equally
represented.
Scrapers on points (in tool list as points)
Five Paleo-points have their distal ends reworked into end-scrapers.
The workmanship and result is similar to the end-scrapers made on
flakes.
Various scrapers (13 specimens)
These are unusual pieces, some with combinations of obverse and
inverse retouch or with combinations of concave and convex working
edges.
GOUGES

Gouge. were classified as a group following the original definitions
of Ray (1941 152—461) In this assemblage each specimen has most
of the following attnbutes

Outline is sub-triangular.
Bit is at right angles to the long axis.
Bit is straight to slightly concave.
Gouge is thicker toward the bit end.
The cross section is nearly plano-convex.
The bit is usually the steepest edge.

There appear to be three types of gouges. Although one of these,
the last, is poorly represented in this assemblage, it is abundant in
south Texas.
1. Gouges made on bifaces.
2. Gouges made on flakes.
a. Bulbar surface not retouched.
b. Bulb of percussion removed or reduced (Fig. 11, e).
3. Gouges made on pebbles with smooth cortex on the ventral
surface.
Gouges on bifaces (52 specimens)
In this assemblage the gouge made on a biface was most frequent
(Fig. 9). Thirty specimens are piano-convex with a piano ventral
surface. Five are piano-convex with convex ventral surface (Fig. 11.
d) and 17 are bi-convex. Two additional specimens are made on the
distal portions of Paleo-points.
Gouges on flakes (12 specimens)
Ten of these specimens have reduced bulbs of percussion.
Gouges on pebbles (1 specimen)
This form of gouge apparently is not a common type for this region.
The flat or “under” face is the cortex surface of the pebble.
BIFACES

Bifaces are larger and heavier than the projectile points. They lack
such alterations as fluting, notching or shouldering, and essentially are
not as well finished as the points. These tools would be called knives
or blades by some authorities, but we would prefer to avoid such con
flicting terminology.
Biface foliates (107 specimens)
The foliates are reasonably thin with quite a few specimens showing
pressure retouch (Fig. 10). It is interesting to note that all but 13

specimens are broken. Does this suggest some rough usage? The edges
show little evidence of battering, raking, or splintering.
Biface blanks (75 specimens)
None of these artifacts seem to be suitable for use as tools in the
condition they are in. There is little question but what they are
partially finished bifaces. Many of them clearly show where the maker
was unable to remove a “knot” in spite of repeated blows.
BIJRINS

There are a number of types as can be seen in the type list above.
Eight of these are of dubious character since they were struck directly
from the edges of points and not from a snapped or truncated platform.
The rest are true burins, many of which could be lost in Old World
collections (Fig. 11, a, b, and c). Almost all of the latter are on snapped
pieces or on truncations.
While it is possible that a few of the burin spalls on the points could
have been the result of the point striking a hard object, this cannot
explain the spalls that originate on the proximal ends. A number of
experiments conducted in the laboratory were unable to produce a

lateral-medial spall by working a concave-base point within its bind
ings on a shaft. Our conclusions were that the spalls were produced by
blows, not pressure.
DRILLS

Drills are bfacially flaked and pressure retouched. All three are on
Paleo-points.
BORERS

These small artifacts show bifacial retouch only at the working tip.
They are on small flakes, frequently biface thinning flakes.
DENTICULATES

Otherwise known as serrated-edged pieces, the denticulates are uni
facially or bifacially worked with three or more uniformly spaced
teeth.
NOTCHES

Notches correspond to spokeshaves in other terminology. Since we
do not know their use, we feel the descriptive term is best. The
diameter of a notch is much smaller than that of a concave scraper,
usually 5 to 15 mm. A single notch is near the distal tip of a broken
Paleo-point.
RETOUCHED FLAKES

Most of these are probably tools of expediency, and the chief
characteristic is the quality of not being a finished piece. Many of
these tools are “flake scrapers” or the like. The worked edges are on
the border between deliberate retouch as found on true scrapers and
heavy use retouch.
VARIA

Oddly shaped bifaces, inversely retouched scrapers and other un
usual tools that do not fit into normal types are placed in this group.
VVorking with a large collection is rewarding in that one can not
only see how well these materials fit the European forms, but one is
permitted to generalize on the range of tool types. There are several
comments that should be made. The scrapers are larger and show
better workmanship than was expected. There are only a few idio
syncratic pieces which might unfortunately be called types in some
local systems.
The frequency and variety of burins was unexpected, but probably
will not be so when more early sites are examined. Epstein (1960:
93—97) has called Texas burins to our attention, but few others seem
to have noticed the frequency of burins on truncations in early sites.

Alexander (1963: 521—523), despite obvious problems with his termi
nology, apparently recovered 7 or 13 specimens at the Levi Site.
There is no way to separate the non projectile point artifacts into
Paleo, Early Archaic or Late Archaic even though the points suggest
that the site was occupied during these eras. There is a strong con
sistency of material, of workmanship, of tool size, and of horizontal
distribution that argues against sharply distinct cultural components.
Rather, there is an impression of relatively continuous utilization of
the same environment by the same ethnic group.
TECHNOLOGY OF FLAKED STONE
Technological processes at the site may have been varied, but the
only one on which we were able to collect considerable data is stone
flaking. In the debris we find cores, cortex flakes, biface thinning flakes
(eclat de taille) and chips. While these demonstrate that considerable
flaking was done at the site, there is an unbalance in cores and cortex
flakes that indicates the shaping of biface blanks and the production
of debitage at some other place, perhaps a gravel bar.
On the projectile points the remains or traces of the technology
have largely been removed, but the scrapers tell us a great deal.
Ninety-six percent of these tools were made on flakes. Sixty percent of
the scrapers are on cortex flakes, and 42.5% had the bulbs of per
cussion deliberately reduced by retouch.
There is no question but what this is essentially a flake industry.
The few blades that appear in the debitage form just over two percent
of the total. Practically all of the tools which permit this sort of
examination were made on flakes.
Within the large collection of cores (126 classifiable) there are few,
if any, that could have produced a flake or blade large enough to
permit the manufacture of most of the biface foliates. It probably
should be assumed that most of these tools were made directly from
cobbles (core-tool rather than flake-tool). Much of this kind of flaking,
as was mentioned above, seems to have been done elsewhere. Cores,
however, were the source of material for other tools. From an inspec
tion of these artifacts we find that 34.1 % had single platforms, 26.2%
had opposed platforms, 23% were more or less globular, and 16.7%
had platforms at 900 to each other.
Prepared platforms appear on 54.3% of the cores while the rest
show only cortex. Flint was the overwhelming choice of material with
quartzite a poor second.
The following is the gross breakdown of artifacts:

Chips were saved if they were large enough to be retained on

14”

hardware cloth. Unfortunately, this did not permit the collection of
most of the debris of pressure chipping, but that would have been an

impossible undertaking. Cortex flakes are less frequent than the ten or
eleven percent often found at Archaic sites, but there are no available
figures for Paleo sites.
Biface thinning flakes were so classified only if the platform con
sisted of the opposite edge of the biface and the angle between the
platform and the bulb was very acute. The figure of 5% seems some
what low, and again may reflect the practice of doing some preforming
at the source of the river cobbles.
Debitage, those flakes and blades available for use as tools but not
used, is of the same material and reflects the same technological
processes as do the tools and the debris.
Use retouch is found mostly on pieces that otherwise would have
been classified as debitage. Equipment similar to that used by Seminov
(1964) was not available for studies of used edges and therefore our
studies are incomplete. Experiments in the laboratory indicate that
similar regular rows of tiny flake scars on sharp flakes can be produced
by lightly scraping bone or vigorously scraping wood. We are not in a
position to comment on the cutting of soft material such as meat,
hides etc.

GRINDING STONES
There are 151 specimens of complete or fragmentary- rnanos (handstones). Fifteen of these are made from stream-rolled cobbles and
136 are made from sandstone rubble. Five cobbles are pecked to shape,
and the grinding surfaces are sharpened by pecking. Two of these are
rounded in outline and three are subrectangular. The rounded speci
mens have a mean diameter of 9.5 cm. The subrectangular manos
have mean lengths of about 9.5 cm. and widths of about 7.0 cm. Two
specimens show to-and-fro use and the ridge between the grinding
fäcsts runs diagonally across their faces. Only two of these cobble
manos have been used on both faces.

sions range from 5 to 8 cm. in width and 7 to 10 cm. in length. Thick
nesses would vary according to amount of use.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

One hundred and thirty-six manos or fragments are made from
stream Cobbles or rubble, hut are so altered that one Cannot be certain.
Seven examples are quite round, 24 are subrectangular to square, and
all the rest are irregular or fragmentary. Of the 136 manos or frag
ments, 58 have been used on both faces and 78 have been used on
only one. A number show a crest between two facets, some of these
are parellel to the long axis and some are diagonal. Exact numbers are
not given because of the fragmentary condition of the sample.
Metates or milling stones are also abundant at the site. One specimen
had been used on both faces, ground to a depth of 0.4 cm. and is
13.5 cm. wide by 26.5 cm. long. The second was used on one face only.
The oval basin is 0.5 cm. deep, 14.0 cm. wide and 30.5 cm. long.
Fragments of metates or milling stones number 164 specimens. Of
these, some 52 specimens have shallow basins to deep narrow basins.
Eight fragments show use on both faces. In addition to all of the
grinding stones listed above, there are 57 fragments that may be either
manos or metates.
Because of the wide distribution of the grinding stones and frag
ments, over the same area as that of the Paleo-Indian and the Archaic
points, it is believed that they date from the same time period as do
those points.
NETSINKERS OR ATLATL WEIGHTS
Ten specimens of this type artifact are in the collection from the
Acton Site. Frank Watt of Waco described this artifact (Watt, 1938:
21—70), and divided it into 12 types. He named it the “Waco Sinker,”
but remarked that this did not infer that the artifact was used as a
fishing sinker. Using Watt’s classification, these artifacts from the
Acton Site are typed as follows :3 specimens, type 3; 2 specimens,
type 4; 1 specimen, type 9; 2 specimens, type 10; and 1 specimen,
unfinished.
Some of these artifacts are made from quartz or quartzite pebbles,
while others are made from sandstone. They are chipped, pecked, and
ground into roughly a long, egg-shaped piece; and then notches are
chipped or ground in each end. All of the specimens from the Acton
Site are made from local materials. One specimen (type 4) came from
Test B (level 2, 6” to 12”) at the site, and was found in a cluster of
pebbles and flakes below the plow zone. It is shown in Fig. 11, f.
This type artifact is always found in sites of the “Carollton Focus”
of the “Trinity Aspect.” A carbon-14 date of 5945 ± 200 B.P. (3986 ±
200 B.C.) was obtained from the Carroliton Focus Zone at the Wood
Pit Site (Crook and Harris, 1959: 1—2). Another Carroliton Focus

ACTON SITE

radiocarbon date of 6030 ± 300 B.P. (4066 ± 300 B.C.) was obtained
from a hearth at Gore Pit Site (Bastian, 1964: 1—4), located near
Lawton, Oklahoma.
CONCLUSIONS
We have attempted to accomplish several purposes in this paper,
the most important of which is the description of the environment,
artifacts and chronology of the Acton Site. The projectile points have
been treated in more or less the traditional way, but the other tools
have been classified in a modern or modified-European system. Basic
to this system is the recognition that form can be described whereas
use is frequently speculative. In addition, we have classified ‘the debris
and debitage into various steps in the manufacturing process. The
value of presenting this kind of information will not be apparent until
a number of sites have been reported in this manner and systematic
comparisons have been made.
The Acton site was the scene of considerable activity over a long
period of time. In regard to the activity, it is apparent that just about
every kind of work went on at the site since numbers of all kinds of
tools were found as well as all sorts of debris and debitage. In other
words, the site was apparently not the scene of one or two highly
specialized kinds of work, play or duty.
If there were any sub areas of specialized activity, we did not
discern them. Repeated ploughing of the field may have been re
sponsible in part for scattering artifacts, but had specific concentra
tions of cores or particular tools existed, we believe they would have
been detected. Paleo points, Archaic points, various other types of
tools as well as debris and debitage were rather evenly scattered over
the field. It is believed that this distribution of artifacts argues against
the existence of a large group which include specialists in certain arts
and crafts. Instead, it would appear that small bands repeatedly or
continuously camped at the site. There are, unfortunately, no specific
hear’ths or concentrations that can be interpreted as single camps.
There are no data which could confirm or deny seasonal occupation
of distinct sites, beyond the observations made above that all kinds of
artifacts were recovered at the site.
There is no accurate technique to determine the length of time
during which the site was occupied. The very small “Arrowpoints”
can be dismissed with a clear conscience as being hunting losses as
there are no other tools at the site that correspond in time. Particularly
scarce to absent are the small end-scrapers, serrated pieces, drills and
most significantly pottery. Technologically, and, we believe, typologi

90

cally the assemblage resulting from the major part of the occupation
consists of the Paleo points, the Archaic points, and the various
scrapers, bifacDs, burins and so forth. To consider just the projectile
points could lead to a traditional view that there were two occupations:
one Paleo-Indian and one Archaic. It is not possible in this assemblage
to separate out two categories of tools, one Paleo and one Archaic.
Thirty-two projectile points were reworked into burins, scrapers,
gouges or notched pieces. It must be emphasized that thirty-one of the
above are Paleo points. We cannot accept the backward hypothesis
that a Late Archaic People went out and collected Paleo points for the
purpose of reworking into other tools.
From the technological viewpoint the tools are characterized by a
uniformity of processes of manufacture that is observable both in the
Paleo points and Early Archaic points as well as in the scrapers,
foliates and gouges. Comparative literature on tools of the Archaic
other than projectile points and “knives” is distressingly weak in
Texas. To the best of our ability, we were able to discover only a
fraction of the scrapers, gouges and retouched flakes within the Acton
assemblage that would appear to be compatable with the few Late
Archaic dart points. There are probably a few artifacts in this collec
tion that are not part of the assemblage in a cultural sense. These
include the late small arrow points and possibly some of the Late
Archaic points. These amount to a very small percentage of the total
artifacts. For statistical purposes it is believed that the typological and
technological lists represent essentially a single culture, certainly an
adaptation to one environment.
Our conclusions, therefore, are that the site represents a single
homogeneous group of Indians who lived there intermittently, season
ally or perhaps for rather long periods of time. The cultural picture is
that of a transition from what has been called Late Paleo-Indian to
Early Archaic. We cannot force the data to produce more than the
mere suggestion that the social unit was a hunting-gathering-fishing
band who made and used all of their varied tools at or near the site.

A Partial Report on Research Work Concerning
Lithic Typology and Technology
J. B.

SOLLBERGER

INTRODUCTION
As long as I was just a collector, everything seemed O.K. hobby
wise. When I came to look upon myself as an amateur archaeologist,
I became dissatisfied. Why? Well, in the latter state, one should have
enough knowledge to answer simple questions concerning archaeology.
For example—where in archaeology can one read that lithic knives
were adapted to wood working, sewing or household chores, and for
the hunt? Where can one read why the answers may or may not be so?
Questions of this nature have always intrigued me.
Finally, I realized that Typology had a new baby brother called
Technology, and that with the two of them, I might again be happy in
archaeology because through technology I might answer some of my
own questions. I resolved to proceed in the following manner. Do the
things with lithics that the Indian did. Learn to make my own lithic
tools. Determine what lithic materials will or will not do.
As a direct result of these experiments in technology I have found
some answers that are presented in the titles following this introduc
tion. My experiments are continuing. Here is a partial list of questions
that I have subjected to research and experiment. Why have lithic
knives not been studied in order that their use-class can be recognized?
Why do we not have bifacially flaked knives with the artifact inven
tories of the Clovis point kill sites (Soliberger, 1968)? Why are
beveled knives beveled? Why should some artifacts be classed as a
hand axe when it often has a thin curved blade with a fine sharp
pressure retouched edge that would obviously break at the first chop
into wood or bone? Is it true that one can examine lithic artifacts and
say—this was done with a hard or soft hammer stone, this with a
billet, or this by pressure?
Among all the questions that I have asked myself, one of the most
pressing has been, can one engage himself in lithic typology and tech
nology with conviction and not be able to duplicate the artifacts as well
as make actual use of them in serious work projects? Can the steel age
mind accurately guess use, class and type, without actually working
with the tools?
These are only some of my questions. My attempts for answers these

Sb

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

past few years, involve many hours and days of flintknapping, quarry
ing, heat-treating of the silica stones, chopping, cutting, boring, and
reaming.
Projects are designed to simulate those I logically expect that the
Indian engaged in. I have acquired some understanding of the qualities
and limitations of lithic materials, and perhaps, some knowledge of
them that the Indian may have applied in using these materials as
tools and weapons.
From the above, I do not suggest that my answers are the ultimate,
or proof positive of use and type. I do believe that by combining a
working knowledge of the capabilities of lithic materials with the
experience of making and using the various artifact replicas will
permit the archaeologist to classify and type artifacts with much more
certain confidence. This approach to typology places the steel age mind
and logic in a secondary position to demonstrable facts. These facts,
homogenized with logic, should build some acceptable bridges beyond
the old stymie of proof positive.
THE LITHIC KNIFE
A lithic knife is a tool used by man that has an edge that is capable
of dividing, portioning, or shaping object materials, with the addition
of force or pressure administered by man.
This tool therefore, may be very elementary. It may be a naturally
sharp stone edge made by nature or it may be a purposely made spall,
flake, blade, uniface, or bifacially chipped flake or core. This cutting
edge may also be stone that has been pecked, ground and polished.
Knives fall into a number of different classes. Expendable knives
had short lives because of the severe nature of work they were put to.
These have a minimum of labor devoted to their manufacture. Long
life knives are finely wrought specimens used on materials that are
soft and easily cut. Wood working knives for coarse wood work are
heavy bodied and strong to inhibit breakage. Wood working knives
designed for across the grain cutting (butt-ends and square cuts) have
especially designed cutting edges that are out of line both lineally and
vertically. Finer work on softer materials required cutting edges that
were in line both lineally and vertically.
Unretouched flake knives will debark and shave limbs of wood for
dart shafts, handles, etc., considerably smoother and faster than will
biface edges. Flake knives will shape and reduce shafts in diameter
easier and faster than will biface edges. Long uniform smooth shavings
are easier and more possible with unretouched flake knives than with
biface edges. Fabric and leather may be cut straighter, easier, and more

J__1 I fliV_ RtOtflfls_fl

intricately with a naturally sharp flake edge. The above is true because
the cutting edge of a flake is even and in line both lineally and
vertically. It is not interrupted by being wavy and ridged as is the
edge pattern of a biface. The flake edge is razor like and does not
clog-up and has a minimum of friction. The biface edge collects fibers,
its undulations increase friction, the cut is wider, coarser and uneven—
which reduces the strength of leather strings or thongs. Flake type
knives were sharpened unifacially (beveled) to preserve the straighter
non clogging cutting edge.
The minus factors of flake knives may have resulted in the develop
ment of biface knives. The biface knife has up to 100% lineal cutting
edge. Unnecessary bulk and thickness is eliminated. Being thin, it is
capable of being resharpened many times making it the equivalent of
many flake knives. The biface knife is more adaptable to shaping that
will incorporate versatility such as points, punches, reamers, etc. If
large, portability is improved. Rafting is provided for and more easily
accomplished.
From the evidence as presented above, knives have attributes or
technological applications in their manufacture that divides them in
use and function. In classifying artifacts as knives, edge technology
must be considered.
The raw material for knives originates at quarry sites or from
cobble stones. Material quality influences both the class and quality of
the knife produced. An artifact in the knife class is a finished product.
It must not be classed as a knife while in the quarry blank stage or in
the intermediate stages of completion. Such partial unifaces and in
complete bifaces should be so listed in site or type inventories.
Once class has been determined, typology can be considered. Be
cause artifacts so often could be used out of class, the major function
must be used to determine type. Knives have been separated from dart
points and spear points in the past on the basis that knives are broader
and ior have more rounding points—making them unsuitable as pene
trators. J. T. Patterson (1936) makes the separation where the stem or
tang is out of line of flight with the point—hence they could not be
used as spears or dart points. Projectiles receive almost no wear
between the point and the haft: therefore, those that show wear or
polish on these lineal edges were used as knives.
I propoce a knife is not a knife, in class, or type, until it is proven to
be so by wear evidence or edge technology.
THE ABRADING KNIFE
I searched through the artifact tool inventories for a tool that would

98

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

make a neat, nearly square, end Cut on limbs and small saplings. This
was a need the Indian faced in making construction materials, arrows,
handles for hoes, knives, celts, and axes. Many experiments proved
that the ground edge and the chipped edge axes will not fill this
requirement.
The right tool was found in the archaeologists scrap pile. Namely,
the quarry blank, the large rough biface, the unfinished blade, or the
cache of blanks. Certain ones of these have the lineal edge character,
the use marks of wear and the proven ability to end my search. With
them, I have cut a number of small saplings and limbs in the proper
sizes for the haftings listed above, and have found them to work
easier, neater, and often quicker than stone or flint axes. The small
willowy limbs that are a bit large for severing, in any fashion, with a
normal edged biface knife are next to impossible to sever with a stone
axe. The stone axe or the flake axe will in this case produce only a long
tapering cut accompanied by much bruising and mashing. The abrad
ing knife will cut these same limbs neatly, and with almost no effort.
Another type of knife, the knife for dressing game and for preparing
hides calls for a light, straight, and sharp cutting edge. Straight, as
opposed to undulating or wavy, so that the skin or leather cuts will be
smooth and even and not burred. Sharp for ease of cutting. In line, as
opposed to serrated, for smoothness of cut. Thin, to eliminate side
friction and drag. This means that butchering and general utility
knives will have as their diagnostic feature a very carefully pressure
flaked edge. These qualities however, represent the opposite require
ments needed for making cuts across the grain on wood. Cutting
wood demands a Strong edge that will not break or dull so quickly
and easily. A saw has teeth that are “set” out from the blade. A saw
passes through a cut leaving parallel planes adjacent to each face. True
saws are next to impossible to fabricate with lithic materials.
The abrading knife is not a saw. It is a biface with long, fairly
straight, lineal edges. These edges are cupped and wavy from per
cussion flaking. The ridges between flake scars are left high and Un
retouched. The3e ridge3, at the lineal edge, do the abrading away of
the wood fibres that are cut partially loose by the lineal cutting edges
of the blade between the ridge ends. The tool is used like a saw—
pushed back and forth. An additional simultaneous motion is added—
the rocking of the tool left and right. This widens the cut to prevent
wedging the tool in the cut. It is also essential because it digs the ridge
points into the side of the cut. This not only removes the fibres raised
by the cutting edge, it also controls the width of the cut and the angle

1d’llrilU RES±Att(kJ.

of the cut. Work progresses around the circumference, as does a
beaver.
Four such heavy duty wood working tools from Edwards Plateau
Aspect Sites, Kerr County, Texas are illustrated (Fig. 1). They are
efficient for cross cut or square end cuts on wood. Example a. is
142 mm. long, 62 mm. wide and 20 mm. thick. The lower long edge
shows heavy wear. Example b. is 135 mm. long, 57 mm. wide, and
24 mm. thick. The lower right edge shows abrasive wear.
Large abrading knives approach twelve inches in length and are
suitable for two handed operation. They have no provision for hafting
as this would obstruct the cutting edges. The large examples sometimes
have their ends unfinished or cortex covered. Some have complete
perimeter cutting edges.
The pictured abrading knife from Kerr County (Fig. 1, c.) is a
combination cross cut (pointed end) and planing or shaving (lower
edge) knife. This example is 170 mm. long, 65 mm. wide, and 24 mm.
thick. The principle wear is on each edge of the pointed half. Shaft
shaving is indicated in the large concave edged flake in the middle.
Small, dart point sized abrading knives have stems for hafting, and
are distinguishable from regular dart point types only by their asym
metry or by the presence of wear on their lineal edges that is evident.
The abrading knife shown in Figure 1, d. is 190 mm. long, 80 mm.
wide and 28 mm. thick. The edges show minutely small flaking that is
evidence of use. This example is also from Kerr County. Projectile
points receive little or no wear as tips for darts.
THE HAND HAMMER

This tool when used as a percusor in flaking stone, requires a
special edge. Opposite the cortex holding end, the cortex is flaked off to
expose the denser, inner material that is required of a hard hammerstone. This working edge is pecked down to remove any sharpness.
The working edge is variable in length and shape and the cobble
cannot be considered to have a blade. The edge is desigred to prevent
spalling of the cobble faces, or splitting, by directing the impact
compression and force lines toward the center of the cobble. Also,
this edge permits the striking on small or limited platform areas. This
type of percussor varies in weight according to the flake size desired.
The:e especially designed percussors are nearly always made from flint
or chert and are most numerous where the coarser grained quartzite
cobbles are lacking.

THE HAND CHOPPER
This tool has a cortex covered holding end with a roughly formed
blade at the opposite end. The bit, or chopping end, shows the evidence
of rough work by being dull, or dubbed blunt, from bone splitting,
grubbing, etc. Some may represent wood cutting hand axes whose
blades have been used to the point that they became too thick and
short for such work, and were retained for more simple hacking work.
THE HAND PICK
This tool has a cortex poii or holding area. It is generally sym
metrical in the form of a triangle. A definite point is directly opposite
the p0
11 and the lineal edges are essentially straight and of the same
length. The blade is generally thick and coarsely flaked. The size
ranges from that of heavy axes to medium sized dart points. Use, or
wear evidence, appears mostly along the lateral edges near the point.
THE HAND AXE
This tool has more refined, thinner cutting edges than the choppers.
Two forms are present. Form A. is made from a flat tabular cortex
covered cobble. Opposite the cortex hand-holding end, a bit is formed
that varies from lightly convex to rounding, but the sides are not
worked lineally, toward the p0
, to form a completely bifaced blade.
11
Form B. is made from lozenge shaped cobbles and have completely
bifaced blades. The lineal edges are convex to rounding and are
irregular and cupped from a lack of finer, or secondary flaking. The
bit generally has this secondary flaking that straightens the edge by
removing the ridges between the primary flakes.
The hand axe was a general utility wood cutting tool. In this
medium silica edges dull rather quickly, necessitating frequent re
sharpening. This erased any polish that would normally accumulate
on the blade faces if the cutting edge remained sharp. New or little
used specimens have wide blades, some of which approach being
pointed. As they are used and resharpened, the blade becomes shorter
and thicker. The open point becomes more rounded until the whole is
too short and thick for wood cutting.

THE CARCASS-CLEAVER
This tool (Fig. 2, a. and b.) is the most refined of the cortex covered
unaltered end, cobble tools. It is presently known in the literature as
the fist, or hand axe. In order to understand why this tool that looks
like an axe is not an axe, requires an explanation of the nature of silica
materials, and what the design features of axe work require.

2. Tools, probably used as carcass cleavers.

The cutting principle of a steel axe is that a deep penetration is made
across the grain of the wood and at an acute angle to the length of the
wood fibre. This compresse3 the fibres length, causing a chip to fly out,
provided the fibres have been cut by a lower, previous strike. This
angle of penetration is the flaking-angle of silica edges. Therefore, if
the wood is hard grained, the silica axe will have its edge flaked on
hard wood (which can be used as a billet or percussor). Silica axes
must also be thicker than steel axes to prevent blade breakage above
the cutting edge. Any prying sideways to loosen chips is, in effect,
pressure flaking, and must be avoided. This applies to deep penetra

.L.I I t1I flE’..ri

tions also, because of the angle of entry through the hard and soft
annual rings of wood. Chipped silica axes must therefore be strong
bladed and the bit ends cannot be too thin. The tool must be of a
highly expendable nature because it will not last very long.
The features that describe the carcass-cleaver knife in its used
classical form, automatically remove the tool from the axe classifica
tion. The cobble selected had fine grained silica suitable for pressure
flaking and sharp cutting edges. The cortex end conveniently fits the
palm of the hand for a thrusting or pushing motion. The biface blade
is flaked, and then it is additionally thinned. On the classic examples,
this thinning results in concavities below the cortex holding area on
each face, also one or both lineal edges will be concave from the addi
tional thinning. A slight in-curve of the blade is present on some
examples near the distal end. This is an impossible feature for a
chopping tool, because it would allow impact forces to break the thin
blades. The distal ends vary in shape from a near-point that is slightly
rounding, to cutting edges that are almost straight, though short.
Others have blades that are “U” shaped below the holding area. Most
classic examples have fine pressure flaking along the extreme distal
cutting end.
An additional feature of this distal end is that it is lineally straight,
ridgeless, thin, and sharp. Sharp in spite of the fact that “use” has
produced a polish on the faces that sometimes extends back more than
an inch from the end.
I have determined from experiments that silica stone edges, when
extensively used to cut earth, stone, bone, or wood, cannot remain
knife-sharp sufficiently long to produce high polish extensively on the
faces above the cutting edge. There is no wood soft enough in Texas
that can be penetrated sufficiently deep to account for this polish on
the carcass-cleaver knives. This tool had to be used in a soft nonabrasive substance.
The Edwards Plateau Aspect was a hunting and gathering culture.
Sickle sheen is implausible because the polish is concentrated at the
ends of these tools and because the balance, and the physical features,
indicate that a thrusting or pushing motion is required for its proper
use. A lack of fine retouch and consistent polish up the lineal edges
supports this method of use. The sum of these cited features proves
that this tool is a knife—not an axe. To demonstrate the type and
justify the name carcass-cleaver, necessitates the introduction of some
logic; logic that is based on the listed features.
I have not yet found a carcass-cleaver knife that was not on, in or
within a very few feet of a burnt rock mound. This certainly associates

I J-t

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

the tool with food preparation. Assume a deer sized animal has been
brought to camp. The skin has been removed or laid open with flake,
or other knives. The carcass is ready for division. Proper slicing is done
to expose the ball-joint of a ham. The ham is raised to place the balljoint under the proper strain. The knife is pushed in and through the
cuter edges of the joint until severance is complete. The back-bones
are divided by bending, away from the thrust. This allows insertion of
the knife’s leading edge in between the bones where tendon, sinew,
and cartilage are cut with body weight exerted through the palm of
the hand, pushing the knife between the bone segments. From this
friction, polish accumulates above the leading edge.
As the back bone becomes too short for effective bending, attempts
to pry the segments open for deeper penetration is evidenced by num
erous carcass-cleaver knives being broken squarely across the blade
about one inch above the leading end. Such breaks, when repaired,
obliterate the major polish. Newer knives with little use, will show no
polish. I recovered these broken distal ends at the burnt rock mounds.
This is further proof that use was at the cooking center. Some are usepolished from about 1/4 inch to 1 inch back from the cutting edge. This
is about the average for this tool whether whole or broken.
A high-gloss shine is present on some very few specimans along an
entire lineal edge to the cortex end. High-gloss is rare on an entire face
but may exist. Some examples have had enough use that the higher
ridges between the flake scars are rounded and worn but do not yet
show polish.
The cortex end of this knife is a very necessary feature for its use
as a carcass cleaver push-knife. This enlargement above the thinned
lower blade allows a full solid grip for the hand to grasp. The cortex
is, in most cases, of a porous texture and a bit rough (like coarse, but
dull, sandpaper). This assures a non-slip grip for the hand, through
which, force can be applied in what is normally a slick, bloody job.
There is little to review, in the literature of the past, concerning
this knife that is called a fist axe. J. E. Pearce and A. T. Jackson (1933:
144) speaking of Southwest Texas say, “Fist axes of both regions are
very much alike but show finer workmanship in Central Texas. E. B.
Sayles (1935: 70) referring to his Plate XIX-a says, “Hand Axe, with
finely chipped, thin blade from Edwards Plateau.” A. T. Jackson,
(1938: 98—100) Fist Axes, Site No. 6 Llano County says “All are
worked down to a fairly sharp cutting edge, but lack the delicate
secondary chipping common to specimens from Edwards to Val Verde
Counties. Length of No. 1 is 6 and 3% inches. Note the large unworked
areas at the upper ends.” A more recent reference is Leroy Johnson Jr.

, i tii’ __ti

I UD

(1961: 275) referring to two small Fist Axes notes “one has signs of
secondary flaking.” Johnson (1964: 65) notes that “The blade was
thinned by careful billet flaking near the tip.”
These past references to a “fist axe” verify many of the features of
Cleaver knives that I have listed earlier in this paper. None, however,
mention the classic forms (Fig. 2) that have developed a “heel” over
the lineal concave edge that is opposite the straighter edge on some
examples. This “heel” is heavy enough from its bulk to throw the
artifact badly out of balance for use as a hand axe.
Is there another knife type in American pre-history with a similarly
shaped blade that was enlarged at the holding end and was pushed
into the work? The Eskimo “Ulus” of Alaska, and the Early Archaic
Ulu of the New England region are of this type. The Ulu is normally
made from slate—chipped, pecked, and ground into a thin, half-circu
lar, blade. The blade expands in thickness at the top to form an en
larged area for holding that is sometimes flat on the top. The cutting
edge is honed for sharpness. The shape and balance of the Ulus and
cleaver knives are basically the same.
THE BILLET. AN INDISPENSABLE TOOL FOR
BIFACING WIDE THIN FLAKES
References to the technology of tools, their processes and products,
are becoming more frequently common in the analysis of the lithic
sections of site reports that may not always be well grounded in fact
or research. Specifically, references to billets, “the hammer and billet
technique,” and the special flake attributed to this tool—the billet flake.
Site inventories have not provided us with adequate artifacts—ex
amples of this tool—that we know its full range in form, size, materials,
and applications. Crabtree (1967: 60—71) has provided descriptions
and uses of the billet tool. My work with the billet tool has produced
information that I believe is pertinent and additional to that now in
print; and is information that places the billet in its proper place in the
lithic tool kit. The following description of a billet is not one of an
artifact, but one that fits me best for the medium to heavy work
described in this text.
A billet is an antler main-beam from a large deer or elk, prefer
ably, and should have all branching tines removed. It should include
as much as possible of the bone between the skin-ring and the top of
the skull, as this bone has the ideal density and hardness for low, or
acute angle, percussion flaking. The tool is best when made from
fresh killed animals, because the bone and antler dry out and become
harder and more brittle with age. The length should be 12 to 16 inches

ivy

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

and the diameter (average) about 1 to 1 1/4 inches. Large tines are
useful as billets but lack the inner density and the bonus quality of
the bone between the skin-ring and the top of the skull.
The billet in use, is held like a modern nail hammer, but the swing
is more stable if three or four inches extends behind the heel of the
hand. The stone being worked, is held in the other hand—which is
protected by leather from flying flakes and jar. A position should be
assumed that is relaxed, wherein the billet may be swung in identical
arcs with repeated precision.
The production of large flakes is primarily the product of large hard
hammer-stones. The initial steps of bifacing the large flakes (reducing
humps and very thick lineal edge areas) is the work of smaller and/or
softer hammer stones. The flake is at this point, roughly bifaced, but
with irregular lineal edges, cupped uneven facial areas, and ‘with
prominent flake scar ridges. These features are the normal result of
bifacing with hand held stone percussors.
Additional work with stone percussors will not materially change
the above conditions, because large platform areas are required for
stone percussion. Continued use will also result in unnecessary loss of
material width in maintaining these platforms. Hammer stone plat
forms must contact the hammer stone face to face, or about 9Q0 to
each other, to prevent crushing the platform. This required depth or
angle inevitably results in biface edge-angles greater than desirable.
The overhang of the hammer stone above the negative bulb on the
biface damages this edge by the follow-through motion of the hammer
stone. Because of hardness and relatively slow speed, the hand held
hammer stone produces prominant positive and negative bulbs of per
cussion. Additional flakes of the desired length and thinness are im
possible without first removing these negative cavities. The replat
forming over these cavities also causes material loss of width to progress
as fast, or faster than, the progress of thinning the biface. Obviously
then, hammer stones are inadequate for producing wide thin bifaces
with desirably acute edge angles.
Let us now consider the billet. The billet does produce flakes of a
distinctive character that are straight, flat and thin, and, the tool was
used for thinning. My research with the billet agrees that this is true,
but that it is of secondary importance. It does not explain the prime
uses of the tool! These are: 1. The execution of trimming and finishing
flakes following initial biface roughed-out flakes by hammer stones;
2. The complete application of bifacing flakes on large flakes that are
too thin to be bifaced with hammer stones. The working details are as
follows.

LITHIC RESEARCH

1U/

Primarily, the billet is for percussion flaking from very narrow or
thin platform edges, at angles more acute than is possible with hammer
stones. This is possible for a number of reasons. There is little or no
overhang of the platform as in the case of hammer stones. Platforms
as narrow as one-sixteenth of an inch may be struck at biface edges
that are at very acute angles. This is because the billet is slightly
penetrated by the platform. The platform does not crush because the
force is spread evenly along the penetrated billet end. The bone
(antler) being softer than lithic material, crumbling or crushing is
almost entirely eliminated. Deep negative bulb cavities are absent,
because of the high speed delivery of the billet stroke and the thinness
of platform area struck.
Very thin original flakes can be completely bifaced with a billet, and
yet remain relatively broad, because of the small size and minimum
of under cutting of the biface by the negative bulbs of percussion. The
billet in this instance is irreplacable because of the very acute angle
of flake removal required and because the flakes must be longer and
wider than pressure flaking permits. Otherwise, the broad thin flake
can not be completely bifaced without being seriously narrowed.
Billet flaking is much faster and easier to perform on thinning and
finishing bifaces than is indirect percussion flaking for these reasons.
1. Small punches (to prevent their ends from splintering or collaps
ing) must seat on deep platforms and face-up with the platform, as in
hammer stone percussion. 2. Compaction and/or splintering of bone
or antler punches results in hinged and broken flakes that ruin the
biface. 3. Punches of larger diameter are best suited for blade making
from large stable masses of stone. The increased diameter does not
materially reduce edge failure of the punch. 4. Rounding of the punch
end to strengthen it still does not eliminate the problem of the very
thin edged, acute angled, biface edges penetrating and splitting the
bone or antler punch.
Percussion flaking with bone or antler in bifacing is desirable over
stone percussion also, because less shock is delivered to the biface.
More pre-forms are therefore finished, rather than broken.
The processes of converting a large flake into a finished biface are
not completely separate and distinct. A hammer stone may be needed
to remove a certain flake in the midst of the billeting procedure. It is
sometimes desirable to pressure flake a platform while the pre-form
is in any stage. It is not always possible to separate hammer stone
flakes, billet flakes, indirect percussion, and pressure flakes. Conditions
in flint knapping exist where the “typical billet flake” is produced by
all four methods. The requirements in. each case involves a platform

108

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

that does not crush and fast undirninishing force application to the
platform.
Conversely, on large flakes that feather out evenly to sharp distal
edges, the deepest negative bulbs possible to produce are the product
of pressure flaking by leverage that is built up slowly until the flake
is detached. The face below the positive bulb will be straight to con
cave. If the pressure is diminished or lost during detachment of the
flake, the flake will shorten in length and the face below the positive
bulb will be convex in the long axis.
The billet may be used to produce flakes with un-billet-like charac
teristics simply by slowing down the billet stroke, and striking plat
forms that have the angle, size, and depth designed for hammer stones.
Postive and negative bulbs will be diffused somewhat, but the resulting
flakes will appear to have been struck by a soft hammer stone.
The rules for successful billet flaking are few and simple. The
important ones are: 1. Large, thin, straight flakes, require a very fast
billet stroke; 2. To prevent hinged or broken flakes, facial and flake
ridges that are concave (at the biface edges) must be rendered straight
or convex before billeting the next row of flakes; 3. To prevent split
ting or breaking of the pre-form, platforms must be lowered to the
side or face of the proposed flake so that the material remaining above
the proposed flake is thicker than the flake proposed. Otherwise, the
flake will be a very short one, at a much greater angle to the lineal
edge of the pre-form. The striking of platforms that are too thick, will
generally result in a broken biface,

Excavations at a Midden Circle Site
In El Paso County, Texas
JOHN

W.

GREER

ABSTRACT
A Type TB midden circle dates to the early part of the Jornada Branch
period (A.D. 900). The occupation probably represents hunters and
gatherers of the Jumano tradition (Livermore Focus?) in contact with the
sedentary agricultural groups of the region.
INTRODUCTION
In December, 1963, I began a concentrated study of midden circles
and mescal pits with a trip, recording sites in many parts of western
Texas and southern New Mexico. During this time I was able to con
tact Vernon R. Brook of the El Paso Archaeological Society, who helped
a great deal by taking me to meet some of the members of the society
who knew of the existence of midden circles: John W. Green, John
Hedrick, Tom Martin, Chuck Koerner, Earl Wood, and others. One
person contacted at this time was Bill Kennedy (Antony, New Mex
ico), who gave the location of a midden circle just east of El Paso. The
site was visited and recorded by Brook, Koerner, and myself the next
day. At that time it was numbered TX-2 in accordance with the num
bering system for midden circle and mescal pit sites recorded by me
and was named the Pow Wow Site after a nearby arroyo of the same
name.
In December, 1965, I returned to El Paso and tested the site using
funds provided by the Department of Anthropology at the University
of Texas. During this time I resided with the Vernon Brook family,
and I would like to thank them for the many courtesies shown me
during both my trips.
LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION
The Pow Wow Site is located about 27 miles east of the center of
El Paso, one-fourth mile north of Highway U. S. 180 to Carlsbad, and
about six miles south of Hueco Tanks, the well known pictograph
area. It is just out of the western edge of the central Hueco Mountains
on a relatively flat desert region with occasional small limestone hills.
Pow Wow Arroyo, a large, dry wash, is approximately 300 yards
south of the site. Numerous natural tanks are shown on the topo

graphic map for the area and, no doubt, provided water for the early
inhabitants There is no water supply in the immediate vicinity of
the site however. The site occupies the eastern and northern slopes
of one of the low, rounded hills and stretches about 200 yards onto
the flat sandy area beyond, at an elevation of approximately 4400
feet above sea level. Vegetation on the site includes abundant lechu
guilla, spider cactus, creosote bushes, and prickly pear. There is no
sotol or any edible species of A gave in the immediate vicinity.
The site is composed of at least two midden circles, a number of
heat-fractured limestone hearths, and various occupation areas of con
centrated ash deposits and artifacts (Fig. 1). Midden #1 is a wellformed type TB midden circle (Greer, 1965: 44—45) with a maximum
outside diameter of 33—36 feet and an inside or pit diameter of 12—14
feet. The midden is on a very slight slope, with the upper side only
0.4 feet higher than the natural ground level and the lower side 2.1
feet higher. The central depression varies in depth below the rim of
the midden from a maximum of 0.3 feet. Tne hill slopes toward N
30° E, and the greatest deposits are on the downhill side of the midden,
which has a nearly level top. The main part of the midden rim is com
posed of fire-fractured limestone rocks (about 3 inches in diameter),
sand, and ash, while the central depression is almost purely a gray,
sandy ash.

Midden #2 is about 120 yards north of Midden #1 and may not
be a midden circle. It is so greatly eroded as to be simply a pile of
rocks and ash about 22 feet in diameter and 7 inches high.
Midden #3 is about 30 feet south of Midden #2 and is another circle
of burned rock, possibly a small midden circle 33 feet in diameter and
about 6 inches high. The very slightly depressed central area is about
11 feet in diameter and at most only 3 inches deep.
Midden #4 is a small, Type TB midden circle near the eastern edge
of ihe site and near a fence running almost north-south. The midden
is 22 feet in diameter and a maximum of 6 inches high. The pit is 11
feet in diameter, a maximum depth of 3 inches, and is composed al
most entirely of rock-free sand and gray ash.
Other concentrations of occupational debris occur in many areas
of the site. Most of the rock concentrations or hearths are about four
feet in diameter and 9 inches high. They are scattered around the
general area of the middens, especially between the hill and the fence
in the area of Midden #4. Most of the subsurface or living debris
seems to be primarily on the hill sides, such as a large area just above
and couthwest of Midden #1. These living areas are full of fire-cracked
limestone, ash concentrations, and a great deal of broken pottery and
flint and agate flakes. No rooms or other living structures were ob
served and are presumably absent from the site.
EXCAVATIONS
In 1965 the site was revisited for the purpose of testing the largest
midden circle (Midden #1) to determine its structure and cultural
affiliation, and obtain a carbon sample suitable for radiocarbon dating.
A trench 2.5 feet wide was laid across the midden, with one edge
lying along the axis of the midden through the center. The trench was
divided into 5 foot excavation units. Unit #4 was in the center of the
central depression and was the first excavated. All material from this
unit was screened through one-third inch hardware cloth and all arti
facts collezted. Because recent work at ring middens had discovered
a paucity of charcoal in sites of this type, at first all charcoal was col
lected. However, it soon became apparent that there was much more
charcoal than was needed, and only the larger pieces—those about
one-half inch or more in diameter—were kept. Pollen and soil samples
were also collected, but these have not been analyzed.
After Unit #4 was excavated into the sterile caliche underlying the
midden, Units #3 and #5 were excavated to complete a profile across
the central depression into the concentrated stones forming the ring.
The deposits from these two units were not screened.

The profile of the excavated trench is quite simple (Fig. 2). At the
surface there is a 3 inch layer of yellowish-tan, wind-blown sand
which covers most of the site. Below this, extending to the basal, coarse
sand, is a deposit of very fine and loose, light brownish-gray, sandy
ash. On either side of the central depression is a deposit of mediumlight to medium (compared to other midden circle sites) rock con
centration, which bulges slightly into the ash a few inches from the
bottom of the midden. This sloping of the concentrated rock is prob
ably due to the rocks falling back into the central area after they had
been piled up so high and does not seem to represent an intentionally
excavated pit into the ashy material.
ARTIFACTS
A tabulation of artifacts is given in Table 1. These include ones
collected during both visits to the site and those in the personal col
lections of Brook, Koerner, and Kennedy. Brook has in his possession
a Harrell point, an Olivella shell bead, and an Ensor point; Koerner
collected a small, obsidian thumbnail scraper; and Kennedy found
3 dart points and a drill near Midden #1 and two arrowpoints on the
midden. He also mentioned finding a large number of beads in the
occupation area just southwest of Midden #1.
Below are comments on the artifact classes and types present at the
site. Long, formal descriptions will not be given here, since most
classes are commonly described in archeological reports for other areas.
For most of the stone artifacts, see descriptions in Johnson (1964)
and other reports describing materials from Val Verde County. Pot
tery types are adequately described by Hawley (1936) and Lehmer
(1948).
Pottery (Fig. 3)

is much finer. The paste is an orangish-brown and the lip is burnished

grade into gray, and the interior is often black. As previously men
tioned by Lehmer (1948: 94) some of the interior surfaces have stria
tions from smoothing with grass bundles. Firing clouds are common
on the exterior, and one sherd bears a mending hole. No rim sherds
were collected. An obvious characteristic of this type is the ease with
which the surfaces erode, leaving the temper even more prominent.
A worked sherd of El Paso Brown has relatively fine sand temper
and smooth surfaces. This is an olla body sherd and was used as a
scraper, possibly during the manufacture of other pottery, as is so
common throughout pottery-making regions. This small sherd is
23 mm. in diameter and 5 mm. thick.

sumably appear fairly late within the El Paso Ware and are decorated
on olla exteriors and on both surfaces of bowls. The dominant attribute
of this type is the coarse, white sand temper which protrudes from the
paste, especially on olla interior surfaces. The rims are slightly
thickened-direct and the lips flat (Fig. 4). No flaring is present. The
bowl rim sherds (probably from the same vessel) bear mending holes.
Surface decorations include broad lines (ca. 6—13 mm. wide) of black
and fugitive red and additional solid areas in black. On whole vessels
which I have observed in various collections unpainted portions (pri
marily the lower parts of the ollas and the centers of the bowls) are
greatly floated and have a dark rust color, as opposed to the common
orange surfaces of El Paso Brown.
Playas Red. These sherds represent jars with quite hard paste con
taining finely ground sand temper. The exterior surface is finely
floated to a natural reddish-brown or a dark rusty-brown polish. The
surface may be either plain (simply floated) or slightly altered. Two
sherds appear to have been gouged (such as the El Paso Gouged sherd)
and then smoothed similarly to the Blind Indented utility ware of the
glaze periods around Santa Fe (Museum of New Mexico material
from the Cochiti area). Another sherd bears parallel, horizontal lines.
The general appearance is that these bands are the original coil boun
daries, which were not entirely smoothed, although the intervening
area (i.e. the coil body) is highly polished. Upon examination, it
appears that the surface was polished, then the bands were engraved
incised while the clay was still very slightly damp. No other incised
sherds were found.

Type undetermined. One rim sherd is probably related to Playas
Red. This slightly flaring, direct rim has a nearly flat lip and a highly
floated, light, reddish-brown exterior. The floated surface does not
appear dark enough for Playas Red. The brownish-gray paste is very
fine and contains fine sand temper.
Another jar body sherd has the exterior finely floated to a dark
gray. Although this surface is not the characteristic red of Playas, it is
probably related to that type. The paste is orange with fine sand
temper.
Beads
Olivella. One small, spire-looped shell bead was found by Brook on
the surface near Midden #1.
Cut shell. A very small, centrally drilled, circular bead of white
shell was found in the area just southwest of Midden #1. Kennedy
(pers. comm.) reported finding many beads in this area during his
digging.

Crinoid. Two light gray beads were made by breaking the casing of
marine
a
worn fossil (Vermetus?) into sections. These are 9 mm. in
diameter and the holes are 3 mm. in diameter. They were found in the
same area as the cut shell bead.
Arrowheads (Fig. 5, a-e)
Triangular. Two plain triangular arrowpoints were recovered. One,
made from a coarse brown material, is wide with straight, but crudely
serrated, blade edges. It is 28 mm. long and 25 mm. wide. The second
point, 23 mm. long and 14 mm. wide, is a narrow triangle with a
slightly concave base and is made of white flint. This point fits the de
scription of the Fresno type (Suhm et al., 1954: 498; Kelly, 1957: 46).
Harrell. A notched triangular point is tentatively identified as
Harrell (Suhm et al.. 1954; Suhm and Jelks, 1962). It may also be
classified as Toyah (Ibid.) or Piedras Triple-Notched (Kelley, 1957:
46), although it may be slightly different from these two types. The
point is triangular with a V-shaped base and sharp basal corners.
There is a notch on each lateral edge not far above the base and one
in the center of the base. The distal tip is broken, but the complete
point was probably 28 mm. long. It was found on the surface about
50 feet northeast of Midden #1.
Livermore. Kennedy found this point and the next one at Midden

Although this point is considered here as representative of the Liver

to a separate type altogether. This type is found over a great deal of
southern New Mexico and far western Texas. Work in midden circles
at Carlsbad Caverns National Park produced many such points. These
seem distinctive from the commonly mentioned Livermore points,
such as the one pictured by Lehmer (1948: p

described by me (Greer, 1966c: 25—27). I have ‘also previously fol
lowed Kelly Smith’s (1963: 187) Brewster County work by including
contracting-stem points from New-Indian sites in Val Verde County
in the Perdiz-Livermore group, a combined type, again differing
slightly from the above styles. All of these points are different from
the classic, cross-shaped Livermore points found by Janes (1930) in
Jeff Davis County and described by Kelley (1957: 46) and Suhm and
others (1954: 502). The Livermore type, as it now stands, at least
should be divided into major varieties (e.g. contracting versus expand
ing stem, triangular versus cross-shaped outline) for descriptive com
parisons and eventually distributional studies.
Type Undetermined. This point also is in the Kennedy collection
from Midden #1. It is a small, thick arrowpoint, about 23 mm. long
and 14 mm. wide at the shoulders. The convex blade edges are notched
just above the square shoulders. The stem is contracting and the base
is slightly notched.
Dart Points
Ensor. In the Brook collection is a short, thick Ensor point (Fig. 5,
f) with wide, shallow lateral notches and a rounded base. The distal
tip is broken, but the estimated length is 40 mm. This point was found
near Midden #1.
Type Undetermined. Three points found by Kennedy have straight
to slightly expanding stems and convex bases (Fig. 5, g-i). The barbs
are strong to long, but not flaring. The blade edges are convex to
recurved, convex at the shoulders and concave at the distal tip. The
points range from 31 to 44mm. long.
Fragment. One distal fragment of a large dart point of white flint
had been ground smooth until the edges and point were rounded and
the flake scars barely visible. This specimen (when whole) probably
had religious significance, such as use in a medicine bag or for cere
monial functions. A. E. Dittert (pers. comm.) reports that at the
Pueblo town of Acoma in central New Mexico, dart points, identified
to types by their relative ages, are used by certain clan shamans during
such practices as curing rituals.

122

Drill (Fig. 5, j)
A fairly thick drill was found by Kennedy on the surface of the
site. The base is small and rounded, and the blunt shaft is parallelsided with edges somewhat smoothed from use. The complete specimen
is 47 mm. long. This appears more like a late Archaic type (possibly
associated with the small dart points from the site) rather than Neo
Indian (pottery and arrowpoint associations), which is generally
characterized by small, finely chipped blades (Ray, 1935: 77; Jackson,
1938: 98; and others).
Graver (Fig. 5, k)
A single flint flake is unaltered except for the sharpening of two
small points by means of minute flaking. Such tools could have been
used for engraving or, more likely, tattooing (see Beals, 1932; Rueck
lug, 1955: 359;Kelley, 1955: 983).
Scraper
A small obsidian flake end scraper (“thumbnail scraper”) was
found by Koerner near Midden #1. It is circular, about 16 mm. in
diameter, and finely unifacially worked around two edges.
Knives (Fig. 5, l-m)
The knives are generally bifacial, widely lanceolate to ovate in
shape and crudely to sparsely chipped. They are made from fine
grained flint to fine quartzite-like material. Length ranges from about
35 to 55 mm.
Miscellaneous Worked Flint
Specimens in this group have one or more worked edges, but they
do not possess any unique descriptive qualities for comparisons with
other materials (such as scraper types). These artifacts are flakes,
sparsely and crudely flaked to serve as scrapers, knives, and possibly
other utilitarian tools.
Utilized Flakes
These small chert flakes have one or more edges with fine micro
flakes or use scars. They may have been used for cutting or scraping.
Blade-Flakes
These are elongated flint flakes, sometimes called “bladelets”. Their
length is greater than twice the width, and they range from 28 to 49
mm. long and 12 to 17 mm. wide. They bear no use marks and ob

1Z,3

viously represent flaking residue (many workers in Texas would
simply place blade-flakes with the rest of the unaltered flakes). I
include the separation of these objects as an aid to present research by
both myself and others.
Unaltered Flakes
Flint. Unaltered flint flakes are generally fairly small—under 40
mm. in diameter. The following flint (fine-grained chert) types are
present: black, bluish-black, all shades of gray, green and purple (same
stone), brown translucent, white, and pink. Flakes of pink-orange
agate were also found.
Limestone. These flakes are larger, usually over 50 mm. in diameter.
The specimens in this group range only from 50 to 65 mm. in maxi
mum dimension and up to 20 mm. thick. Specimens from other sites in
western Texas (Brewster, Jeff Davis, Hudsbeth, and El Paso counties)
and southern New Mexico (Eddy County) are often larger and much
more abundant.
Large Flint Tools
These are primarily core tools, probably used as small choppers or
scraping planes. There is one percussion-flaked edge on each, and two
specimens were additionally used as hammerstones. They are about
64 mm. in diameter and 23 to 49 mm. thick.
Limestone Tools (Figs. 6 and 7)
These are both core (or cobble) tools and large flake tools, probably
used primarily as choppers, scraping planes, crude saws, and large
knives. Each specimen has at least one crudely worked edge. There is
one unifacial chopper, three bifacial choppers, two bifacial knives
(“mescal knives”?) flaked along one long edge, and an elongated adz.
The last tool is very steeply beveled on one end, and the lower, ventral
planar surface is ground smooth, probably from use. These limestone
tools range in length from about 93 to 163 mm. The thicknesses and
shapes vary, as might be expected, due to the nature of the material.
Pebbles
Two small pebbles were found on the surface. One is limestone with
fine-grained green chert-like material at one end and a core of brown
flint. The second specimen is an obsidian pebble which appears to have
been battered somewhat. There is a burin-like chisel edge at one end
that may truly be a utilized burin. The coal-like opaqueness suggests
that this specimen is of local origin, as it seems that this type of

DISCUSSION
The Pow Wow Site apparently represents a multi-occupational area
dating within the time of the Jornada Branch of the Mogollon (see
Lehmer, 1948). The site is located on the desert flats barely out of the
central Hueco Mountains and at what appears to have been a favored
camping place. Midden #1 and the occupational deposits immediately
to the southwest of the midden probably represent the earliest occupa
tion as indicated by the dominance of El Paso Brown pottery. The
small, so-called dart points and the stemmed arrow-points are probably
products of this occupation. Middens #2 and #3 are apparently later
and account for nearly all of the El Paso Polychrome and Playas Red
and all of the Chupadero Black-on-white.
The dates from two carbon samples taken from Unit #4 seem quite
reasonable in light of pottery associations. The dates, released by the

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Radiocarbon Laboratory of the University of Texas (Valastro et aL,
1968), are A.D. 990±80 (Tx-363) and A.D. 840±60 (Tx-364). Al
though the dates from this split sample should have been identical,
they agree that the midden dates Ca. A.D. 900. This would also
strengthen the hypothesis that the midden dates before the introduc
tion of Chupadero Black-on-White (ca. A.D. 1050) and El Paso Poly
chrome (somewhat later).
In all likelihood the site was occupied by small groups of hunters
and gatherers like the Jumano, who spent much of their time in the
mountain areas hunting wild animals and gathering and roasting sotol
and/or agave (mescal). They were obviously in close contact with the
sedentary agriculturalists of the area as shown by the abundant pottery
in midden circle sites. Obsidian and western shell beads from the Gulf
of California were probably obtained via the Jornada Branch villages.
Whether the nomadic groups lived and traded with the local villages,
as Lehmer (1960: 126) points out from early sources, or raided the
villages in this desert-sand dune region and then returned to their
mountain country with the loot, is unknown.
The middens at the site, particularly middens #1 and #4, appeared
on the surface as Type TB midden circles (Greer, 1965: 44—45)—
mounded, circular accumulations of hearthstones with a wide, shallow
depression in the center. Excavation in the central area of Midden #1
confirmed its structure as a midden circle, as it lacked the subsurface
pit necessary for mescal pit middens (Greer, 1967).
At this point I would like to suggest a slight change in the nomen
clature for the middens in which I have been working. In 1963 I made
an extensive (though definitely not intensive) survey of sites conform
ing to the then common term “midden circle”. A typology of such
phenomena resulting from the survey and from voluminous corre
spondence was published two years later (Greer, 1965). At that time
(and subsequently) a midden circle was designated a specialized
accumulation of debris resulting from a surface hearth, while mescal
pits were evidence of a pit-cooking (earth oven) technique. Thus, the
variations in midden structure was thought to have cultural implica
tions (Greer, 1967).
Before these distinctions can be made, however, there is a necessity
for more field work in order to judge with some certainty the internal
structure of a burned rock midden from its surface characteristics.
Probably no one would ever confuse a deep, stone lined Type VA
roasting pit of the Casas Grandes style in Chihuahua, Mexico, with a
Type IA “midden circle” in the Guadalupe Mountains of southern
New Mexico. But, on the other hand, one would not be able to ascertain

only after a substantial amount of midden material had accumulated.
The inadequacy of our present knowledge has led to the term “ring
midden” for the type of doughnut-shaped structure appearing as a
ring of mounded hearthstones, ash, or a combination of these surround
ing a depression of almost rock-free gray ash. “Ring midden” will be
used to signify a particular form with an unknown function. When
the function is ascertained through excavation (sub-surface pits are
occasionally, but rarely observable before excavation; the lack of a
stone-lined pit is never known), then the terms “midden circle” and
“mescal pit” can be used with some meaning and for the purpose of
cultural reconstruction. Eventually we should be able to predict sub

known as El Paso Brown. As time passed, the temper became more
prominent and the paste more friable. Surface decorations were added,
such as the application of a red wash and gouging (probably a crude
copy of Playas Red and Playas Incised) or even painting with either
red or black lines on the brown surface (likely the influence from the
Chihuahuan and Hohokam areas). Eventually the ware came to be
realized as vessels with a highly floated (though not attaining a polish)
surface with polychrome designs in black and fugitive red.
Following a suggestion by the El Paso Archaeological Society (n. d.)
I am proposing that the present El Paso Brown be divided into El Paso
Brown (with relative age, designated by the abundance of tempering
material, duly noted in any descriptions, e.g. El Paso Brown, varieties
fine and coarse), El Paso Gouged, El Paso Punched (see Lehmer.
1948: 94), El Paso Black-on-brown, and El Paso Red-on-brown. Next
would be El Paso Polychrome. These types could be put into a unit
designated El Paso Ware or, if one preferred, the El Paso Series, origi
nating from a single cultural group in duration over a moderate length
of time and important enough to show their influence in such distant
areas as the northern part of the Texas Panhandle (Watts, 1963).
Another problem in the archeology of the West Texas area is the
relationship of the small, side-notched dart points to the arrowpoints.
Such is the case at the Pow Wow Site, where one Ensor point and 3
small points similar to Guadalupe points (Greer, 1966c: 30) were
found on the site with abundant El Paso Ware and a few arrowpoints
(Livermore, Harrell, and Fresno). It seems that these small dart points
occur on every midden circle site thus far examined, including all
apparently single occupation Neo-Indian sites. Such occurrences sug
gest that the dart points and the arrowpoints were in part contempor
aneous and in direct association (e.g. Greer, ms). Dibble (1967: 34)
also has pointed out that the “liberal admixture” of the side-notched
Ensor points with the smaller arrowpoint styles is at least suggestive
of a degree of contemporaneity in his extraordinairly well-stratified
Arenosa Shelter at the mouth of the Pecos River in Val Verde County.
I might also suggest that both sizes were probably used on arrows, as
it seems to me unlikely that a group would use both the bow and the
atlati.
This hypothesis seems quite reasonable with reference to various
ethnographic data. Spier (1928: 151), for instance, mentions that the
Havasupai of northern Arizona (who also have the mescal pit type
ring middens) used arrowpoints 3 to 6 cm. long (well within the limit
of the small dart points). The shorter points were used with reed shafts
and the longer with solid wooden shafts of willow. We, of course, do

129

MIDDEN CIRCLE SITE

not as yet know how the late dart points were hafted in western and
southwestern Texas. It is interesting, however, that ring middens seem
to have come into the area with the introduction of the side-notching
tradition (Ensor-Frio period of Val Verde County area, Greer, 1966a.
1 966b: 15). It may be that a migration of peoples brought with them
the introduction of the bow, as well as special cooking techniques
applied to local foods.
More ring midden sites in the area of El Paso should be excavated
and the sites carefully studied. Only in this way can we hope to deter
mine both the cultural affiliation of the ring midden sites and the
relationship between the Jumano (or Livermore Focus) of the El Paso
area and the Jornada Branch with its strong Chihuahuan connections.
More data are also needed from this area for a complete evaluation of
ring midden sites in western Texas and southern New Mexico.

(X41CO-1O) Cooke County, Texas

ABSTRACT
Two eroding hearths were excavated on the Field Ranch Site in West
Central Cooke County, Texas. Surface collections and excavation produced
tools and lithic refuse which relates technologically and lithologically to
early points found there previously.
PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The Anthropology Research Center of Southern Methodist Univer
sity was contacted during March, 1967 by Butch Guerin, of Nocona,
Texas, concerning a site in Cooke County. The Field Ranch Site
(X41CO-1O) is eroding out of the bank of a small conservation lake
on the upper reaches of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River in Cooke
County, Texas, within the construction area of Soil Conservation
Project No. 5, a proposed dam and lake complex some eight miles
southeast of Saint Jo, Texas.
The Field Ranch Site was visited twice by Southern Methodist Uni
versity field parties, and extensive surface collections were made. Two
concentrations of material were noted and hearth stones were seen
eroding from these areas. Materials from the locale included several
Paleo-Indian projectile points.
A change order was negotiated with the National Park Service to
provide for excavation. A field team under the direction of Dr. Edward
B. Jelks tested the site during the second week of May, 1967.
A number of individuals provided assistance and cooperation during
excavation at the site. H. D. Fields granted us permission to work on
his property and Doc ‘Welsh, the ranch foreman, his son, Guy Welsh,
and Butch Guerin, allowed the study of their artifact collections from
the area. Jon Gibson assisted in the excavation and recording of data at
the site.
R. King Harris, Tony Marks, and Joel Shiner, of the Anthropology
Research Center, offered advice and criticism during analysis of the
collections from the site. Marcia McGee and Linda Smith prepared
the illustrations for this report.
ENVIRONMENT
The area is characterized by gently rolling limestone hills covered

134

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

with native bunch grasses. The creeks which intersect the region are
permanent and dense vegetation and tree stands are present along
them. Cooke County falls within the Texan biotic province described
by Blair (1950: 100-402). A small portion of the flora and fauna may
well have been utilized by earlier site occupants; these include wild
plums, large mouth bass, bullheads, bluegills and bull frogs. Rabbits,
waterfowl, quail, and deer are quite common in the area.
GEOLOGY
The geological situation at the Field Ranch Site is similar to that
seen at road cuts in the area.
Zone II
The upper most geological member in the area consists of two
facies. Zone TIc is a poorly developed humic zone, averaging 15 cm.
in depth. Zone JIb is a buff to gray brown sandy silt with some humic
content. The zone averages 1 m. to 2 m. in depth and a great deal of
caliche is weathering out of its exposed faces. Zones JIb and c may
have been deposited as outwash from nearby hills surroimding this
area. It is suggested that Zone ha clays originate from the weathered
sandstone below (Bob Slaughter: personal communication).
Zone I
Zone I, the basic bedrock member, consists of a white, fairly coarse
sandstone extending down for an undetermined depth. This sand
stone is part of the Travis Peak Formation of the Lower Cretaceous
described by Sellards (1966: 310—319).
EXCAVATION PROCEDURE
Extensive surface collections were made along the bank. Material
from the5e collections was probably associated with the two exposed
hearths and possibly others which may have completely eroded out.
The approximate limit of each hearth was blocked out and the
matrix around the exposed hearth stones was removed. All tools,
debitage, and additional hearthstones were left in place for photo
graphing and recording. Detailed plans of the excavations were plotted
from surveying stakes placed by the United States Corps of Engineers,
the hearths were later recorded on a Corps of Engineers map for the
area (Fig. 1).
THE FEATURES
The hearths were situated at the contact between Zone ha and lib,

top of the red clay. The hearths were 100 meters apart. A filled in
stream channel, which had cut through the red clay into the Zone I
white sands, separated them. It could not be determined whether this
channel pre-dated or post-dated the occupational features.
Excavation showed that one of the hearths exposed in the bank of the
lake had been almost completely disturbed by erosion and the other
was only partially disturbed. Neither of the hearths showed any evi
dence of fire, there was no charcoal present and the clay showed no
discoloration.

Hearth 1 (Fig. 2)
Hearth 1 is an almost completely disturbed hearth at the northern
end of the bank. Fine washlines beneath the hearthstones indicated
thai: they had been moved out of place by erosion; several flakes in and
around the feature were in undisturbed matrix. The hearthstones and
associated material were concentrated in an area about 1 m. east-west
and 2m. north-south. The material associated with the hearth includes
1 tool and 6 flakes.

Hearth 2 (Fig. 3)
Hearth 2 was eroding out of the southern margin of the lake bank
and was only partially disturbed. While several hearthstones had
washed silts beneath them, several were found resting on undisturbed
red clay. The feature encompassed an area 1 m. east-west and 3 m.
north-south. Materials associated with this hearth include 3 cores,
2 tools, a chunk, and 2 flakes.
MATERIALS RECOVERED
The bulk of the material found at the Field Ranch Site, unfortu
nately came from surface collections. A few tools and a fairly large
amount of debitage was recovered.

Description: A well-made bifacially chipped lanceolate point, the
flake scars are symmetrical and in general conform well with speci
mens described from the Midland Site (Wendorf et al.: 1955). The
point is basally and laterally ground, and made of gray chert.
Dimensions: Maximum length: 49.6 mm.; maximum blade width,
16 mm., maximum thickness, 5 mm.; basal width 15.9 mm.; depth of
basal concavity, 1 mm.
Provenience: Surface, Guerin collection.
Folsom Point: (2 specimens, Fig. 4, b and d)
Description: Neither of these points are worked as carefully as
specimens from the type site Folsom, New Mexico (Wormington
1957: 23—25). They are somewhat asymmetrical; flake scars are fairly
irregular, and thinning scars are not as long or broad as on examples
from Folsom, New Mexico or the Lindenmeir Site in Colorado. Both
specimens are basally and laterally ground, one is made of a uniform
gray chert (Fig. 4 d), the other of a white patinated chert (Fig. 4 b).
The gray colored point has been reworked laterally from about mid
way to the distal tip. This subsequent work has modified the thinning
scars on both faces, and the general outline now appears truncated
rather than recurved.
Dimensions: Gray reworked specimen, maximum length, 34.9 mm.;
maximum width, 18 mm.; maximum thickness, 5.7 mm.; basal width,
18.3 mm.; depth of basal concavity, 3 mm. White specimen: Maxi
mum length, 31.5 mm.; maximum width, 18mm.; maximum thick
ness, 5.4mm.; basal width, 16mm.; depth of basal concavity, 1 mm.
Provenience: Surface (2), Guerin collection.
Plainview Points: (2 specimens, Fig. 4, c and f)
Description: This type is represented by the basal portions of two
points. Both were made of gray chert and have a series of basal thinfling scars similar to those found on some of the Plainview Site speci
mens (Sellards, Evans, and Meade, 1947: 928—952). Basal and lateral
grinding is present.
Dimensions: Specimen in Figure 4, f, maximum length, 18 mm.;
maximum width, 23.6 mm.; maximum thickness, 6 mm.; basal width,
20.4mm.; depth of basal concavity, 2mm. Specimen in Figure 4, c,
maximum length, 14 mm.; maximum width, 24 mm.; maximum
thickness, 7 mm.; basal width, 23.3 mm.; depth of basal concavity,
3 mm.
Provenience: Surface (2), Guerin collection.
Clovis Point: (1 specimen, Fig. 4, g)
Description: The specimen is a basal portion of a large Clovis point

made of a fine textured white quartzite. The fragment is bifacially
worked, has the typical broad flutes or thinning scars on both faces,
and is basally and laterally ground.
Dimensions: Maximumlength, 19.5 mm.; maximumwidth, 32 mm.;
maximum thickness, 8 mm.; basal width, 34 mm.; depth of basal con
cavity, 1.5 mm.
Provenience: Surface, Guerin collection.
Edgewood point: (1 specimen, Fig. 4, e)
Description: Edgewood points were first described by Suhm, Krieger
and Jeiks (1959: 418—419). The Field Ranch point has an expanding
stem and is made of buff-gray chert. The tip is damaged, and the edges
are slightly irregular to concave base.
Dimensions: Maximum length, 28 mm.; maximum width, 22.8 mm.;
width at base, 14.8 mm.; depth of basal concavity, 1.5 mm.
Provenience: Surface, Guerin collection.
Hell Gap-like: (1 specimen, Fig. 4, h)
Description: A long, slightly contracting stemmed point made of
gray chert. The blade edges are convex and symmetrical; rather weak
shoulders are present at the blade-stem juncture, and the base is
slightly concave. The point has a lenticular cross section and very
uniform bifacial chipping. This specimen is similar in most respects
to the Hell Gap Points described by Agogino (1961: 558—560), except
for basal concavity which the Wyoming specimens do not have.
Dimensions: Maximum length, 66 mm.; maximum width, 25 mm.;
maximum thickness, 6 mm.; width of base, 14.3 mm.; depth of basal
concavity, 2.5 mm.
Provenience: Surface, Welsh collection.
Gouge: (1 specimen, Fig. 5, d)
Description: A trapezoidal shaped, bifacially worked tool showing
use polish on its ventral surface. The dorsal surface is convex giving
the specimen a plano-convex cross section. The narrower end of the
specimen is convex; the wider end is roughly convex, but has two large
flake scars which give it a slightly irregular appearance. One lateral
edge is concave, the other convex; all four edges of the tool were formed
by steep percussion flake removal from the ventral surface. The tool is
niädëof buff caliche encrusted chert.
Dimensions: Maximum length, 28 mm.; maximum width, 29 mm.;
maximum thickness, 13 mm.

Convex Side Scraper: (1 specimen, Fig. 5, e)
Description: This tool is made of a chunk or slab of tabular white
fine grained quartzite. Cortex remains on both surfaces. The scraping
edge is convex and characterized by steep unifacial percussion flaking.
Dimensions: Length, 64 mm.; width, 48 mm.; thickness, 26 mm.
Provenience: Surface.
Graver: (1 specimen, Fig. 5, a)
Description: A graver point or bit was made on a secondary cortex
flake. About 50% of residual cortex remains on the outer surface; no
bulbar or platform retouch is present. The distal end, opposite the
bulb of percussion, is retouched to form a “beaked” tip or graver point.
This unifacial modification is represented by two oblique truncations,
one on the distal end of the flake and parallel with the striking plat
form. The other is a transverse truncation on the flake’s cortex bearing
side. Both truncations are slightly concave thereby accentuating the
graver tip. The tool is made of white chert.
Dimensions: Length, 30 mm.; width, 18 mm.; thickness, 4mm.;
length of graver tip, 2 mm.
Provenience: Surface.
Denticulates: (3 specimens, Fig. 5, b, c and f)
Description: Two of these tools are made on irregularly shaped
chunks of white chert. The third specimen is on a gray chert cortex
flake. The three denticulates have at least one retouched edge. The
natural or non-prepared flat surfaces on these tools were used as
striking platforms for the removal of a series of shallow percussion
flakes at fairly regular intervals thereby forming a toothed or jagged
edge.

pieces of chert which cannot be placed into a tool or tool making
by-product category, and are essentially unidentifiable chipped stone
fragments.
Provenience: Surface (13), Hearth 2 (2).
DISCUSSION
Seven early points including Clovis, Folsom, Midland, Plainview,
and Hell Gap-like were found at the site; the sample includes four
complete and three basal sections. The convex side scraper, denticu
lates and the utilized isolated flake core together with numbers of
sharp little flakes probably served as butchering tools. The graver and
gouge were probably wood and bone working tools, and perhaps were
used specifically for making dart shafts. The two hammerstones, the
cores, and numerous flakes all argue for work of a non-food processing
sort. From a total flake sample of 151 pieces, 98 were complete or
fragmentary biface thinning flakes. These flakes are the by-product of
manufacturing bifaces and especially thinning them. The size of the
biface thinning flakes from the site essentially reflects point manu
facture; materials from which the Field Ranch points and tools were
made is lithologically the same as much of the debitage and stone
refuse.
Surface materials represent a geological rather than cultural associ
ation and therefore may represent more than one occupation. The
presence of an Archaic dart point at Field Ranch Site suggests visits to
the area by later hunting groups. Notched points have been reported
in early contexts by Agogino and Frankforter (1960 414—415) and
Sellards (1940: 1637 and 1642), however, and we cannot rule out
entirely the possibility of the Edgewood points origin in a pre-Archaic
context.
The materials and architectural features indicate that a range of
activities were conducted at the site; the presence of cores, hammer
stones, debitage, bone and wood working tools, and scraping instru
ments suggest that the site represents a base camp for tool manufacture
and food preparation. However, the presence of points from different
chronological horizons would suggest differential use of the site at
different times. As such, it may represent a hunting station also. The
limited amount of material would argue for short, intermittent
occupancy.

Paleo-Indian Artifacts from Sites Along
San Miguel Creek: Frio, Atascosa and
McMullen Counties, Texas
THOMAS

ABSTRACT
number
A
of probable late Paleo-Indian projectile points have been
collected from eight sites along San Miguel Creek, in Frio, Atascosa, and
McMullen counties. These artifacts are described and illustrated in this
paper; the Angostura, Plainview, Plainview golondrina, Meserve, and
Milnesand types appear to be represented. Archaic and other non-Paleo
Indian artifacts from these sites are tabulated and briefly described.
INTRODUCTION
San Miguel Creek is formed by the confluence of Black Creek and
Cat Creek in east-central Frio County, about 50 miles southwest of
San Antonio, Texas. From its headwaters, it flows over a 45-mile
course through eastern Frio, southwestern Atascosa and northern
McMullen counties; it roughly parallels the Frio River. which it joins
near Calliham in McMullen County (see Fig. 1). While the entire
creek has not been systematically surveyed, a number of sites have
been recorded along the central part. In 1954, Dr. T. N. Campbell’s
Anthropology 340 class (from The University of Texas) recorded
several sites in southeast Frio and southwest Atascosa counties, most
of which were exposed by gullying and sheet erosion along both sides
of San Miguel Creek. The collections gathered at that time are stored
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (T.A.R.L.) at Austin.
In recent years, William Stanton, Jr. (of Corpus Christi) has collected
from site 41 AT 10, on San Miguel Creek in southwest Atascosa
County; he has graciously made materials from this site available for
study. In McMullen County, Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Tunnell located a
large site (41 MC 1) near the town of Cross, along the southern side of
San Miguel Creek. The collection made by Mr. and Mrs. Tunnell is
also stored at T.A.R.L., and a detailed report on it is in preparation
(Hester, MS, “Archeological Materials from Three Areas of South—
western Texas”).
The sites thus far recorded along San Miguel Creek have pre-.
dominantly Archaic artifact assemblages. The various classes of artifacts found at the sites are discussed briefly and are listed in Table 1.

In addition to the Archaic materials, a number of possible late Paleo
Indian projectile points have also been found. It is the purpose of this
paper to describe these probable Paleo-Indian materials and to discuss
some of the problems posed by them.
DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIMENS
Twenty-three Paleo-Indian projectile points are described and both
faces are illustrated. While most of them fit rather easily into pre
viously described types, they have been sorted into descriptive groups,
each of which has been given a letter designation. Within each group,
the specimens are described, and the dimensions, material of manu
facture, workmanship, and provenience are given; there is also a dis
cussion of the type each group most closely resembles. Detailed mea
surements (in millimeters) are given for each specimen, using these
symbols: L: length; MW: maximum width; BW: basal width; and,
MT: maximum thickness. The abbreviation “PROV.” is used to indi
cate the site provenience of the specimens. Incomplete measurements
are enclosed in parentheses; if the measurement is an estimated one,
the abbreviation “est.” will appear. Some of the sites are designated
according to the trinomial system employed by The University of
Texas; for example, the site designation 41 AT 10 indicates that the
site is in Texas (41), in Atascosa County (AT), and is the tenth site
recorded in the county. Other sites, where detailed location and de
scriptive data are lacking, retain the quadrangle designations formerly
used by The University of Texas; 71 A4—1 is an example.
GROUP A
No. of spccimens: 9 (all fragmentary)
Outline form: Most are basal fragments; the more complete sped
rnens have lanceolate outlines. Bases are concave on six specimens,
and straight on the others. The distal end of one specimen may have
been alternately beveled, but it is damaged and this cannot be de
termined with certainty. Another specimen has been reworked into a
drill (Fig. 5, c,c’); its lateral edges are somewhat damaged. Lateral
edge smoothing (near the base) is present on seven of the specimens,
and the extent of smoothing is indicated in Figs. 2 and 5.
Materials: All are made from flint (Or chert). Colors include
translucent brown (2), light tan to cream (4), mottled gray (1),
and light brown (2).
‘Workmanship: Horizontal flaking is present on four, with finely
executed oblique flake scars on another. Flaking is irregular on the
other four specimens. Marginal retouching is evident on six of them.

Basal thinning has been accomplished by the removal of short, vertical
flakes on all specimens.
Discussion: These specimens fall within the range of the Angostura
type, as defined by Suhm, Krieger and Jeiks (1954: 402). Some could
be included in the type as described by Hughes (1949: 270), Wheeler
(1954: 4) and Wormington (1957: 269).
GROUP B
No. of Specimens: 5 (1 complete, 1 nearly complete, 3 fragments)
Outline form: They are lanceolate, with edges almost parallel near
the base, and then curving toward the distal end. On all specimens,
the widest part is near midsection. The basal edges are markedly con
cave on two specimens, and only slightly so on the others. The lateral
edges near the proximal ends are smoothed on all specimens, and the
basal edges are smoothed on two.

Materials: All are made of flint, with colors varying from light
gray (2) to light brown (2) and dark brown (1).
Workmanship: Three exhibit very skillful chipping, vvith horizontal
to slightly oblique flake scars. The other two also show some parallel
chipping, but are less well-made, perhaps due to the quality of flint
used. Short vertical flakes, often crescentic or arc-shaped, have been
removed in thinning the base of each specimen. Fine marginal retouch
is present along the lateral edges of most specimens. One specimen,

as described by Krieger (1945: 938—952), Suhm, Krieger and Jeiks
(1954: 472) and Wormin.gton (1957: 265).
GROUP C
No. of Specimens: 5 (1 complete, 4 fragmentary)
Outline Form: These points have lanceolate outlines; the lateral
edges near the proximal end are straight (or slightly concave) and
almost parallel. The basal edges are markedly concave. The basal
corners are slightly flared on three specimens, and are more widely
flared on the other two. Basal thinning was accomplished through the
removal of short, vertical flakes forming a lunate pattern of flake scars
(see Johnson, 1964: 49). Maximum width occurs at midsection on
one specimen and at the base on the others. Edges are well-dulled near
the base.

Maximum width of the blade. On these specimens. the actual maximum width
occurred at the base.

Material: Flint of the following colors was used in the manufacture
of these specimens: tan, pinkish-tan, mottled gray. mottled graybrown, translucent mottled brown.
Workmanship: Neat horizontal flake scars are present on two speci
mens, while flaking on the others is irregular. The blade on one speci
men has been reworked to a crude point (Fig. 4.c,c’). A burin-like
facet is present at the break on one edge of another specimen (Fig.
4,a,a’), but this seems to be the result of impact, rather than an inten
tional blow. One specimen has been damaged by thermal-fracturing.
Discussion: Johnson (1964: 47—52) has defined the golondrina
variety of the Plainview type, and the specimens described here appear
to be good examples of that variety. He attributes the golondrina
specimens found at the Devil’s Mouth Site (in Val Verde County.
Texas) to a “Late Paleo-hidian” occupation. Johnson also presents
some distributional data on golondrina (pp. 49—52).

Outline form: They have lanceolate outlines, with straight (nearly
parallel) edges near the base. The basal edges are deeply concave.
The parallel edges at the proximal end extend approximately onethird of the way up the blade (maximum width occurs at that point),
where they then converge toward the distal tip. The blade edges on
all three specimens are alternately beveled along the right edge. The
basal corners flare slightly on two specimens (as in the case of Group
C), but are not flared at all on the third. Lateral edges near the base
are smoothed.

from the type site (Sellards, 1955: Figs. 98—100).

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

OTHER ARTIFACTS FROM SAN MIGUEL CREEK SITES
The author has briefly studied the non-Paleo-Indian artifact assem
blages from eight San Miguel Creek sites. There are a variety of dart
points represented, including stemmed types reminiscent of Edwards
Plateau and Trans-Pecos cultures (Suhm, Krieger and Jeiks, 1954:
53, 108) and unstexnmed forms found commonly in southwest Texas
(Weir, 1956: 62—72); Nunley and Hester, 1966: 249). Tortugas occurs
at all of the sites; other major types include: Abasolo, Bell, (Sorrow,
Shafer and Ross, 1967: 12—14), Ensor, Fairland, Langtry, Lerma-like,
Pedernales, and miscellaneous unclassified expanding stem dart points.
Minor types found at the sites are listed in Table 1. Arrow points are
very rare; Perdiz was found at one site, Scallorn at another, and
Fresno-like (triangular) at still another.
However, projectile points are a small part of the artifact assem
blages examined from these sites. When all eight sites are compared,
there seems to be a great deal of uniformity in the assemblages, and
this is reflected primarily by the non-projectile point artifacts. Uni
facial gouge-scrapers, called Clear Fork Planer-Gouges by Ray (1941:
154), and by the local name of Dimmit scrapers by Nunley and
Hester (1966: 238) were found at the sites as were bifacial gougescrapers (Ray’s Clear Fork Gouge 1, 1941: 153). Often these tools
were found in large numbers. Other common items are heavy crude
choppers and core-choppers, triangular knives, a type of gouge with
the local name of Guadalupe or Attwater, ovate knives, unifacial
scrapers made on cortex flakes, lanceolate knives, and a series of
thick lanceolate, bipointed tools exhibiting both bifacial and unifacial
flaking. Several scrapers with trapezoidal outlines, bifacial flaking and
a single steeply-beveled edge were found at two sites. The name of
Nueces scraper has been suggested for this tool (Hester, unpublished
manuscript).
While most of the dart points probably represent Archaic Occupa
tions, and the arrow points possible Neo-American habitation, it is
impossible to determine with certainty the age or cultural affiliation
of the non-projectile point artifacts with our present data. We can
speculate that the bulk of these artifacts might be attributable to
Archaic peoples, but some may be representative of earlier cultures.
Foremost among those of possible Paleo-Indian age are the unifacial
and bifacial gouge-scrapers. Epstein (ms.) has presented evidence that
at least some Clear Fork-like gouge-scrapers appeared “during terminal
Pleistocene times in North America”. However, both the bifacial and
uriifacial varieties occur widely on Archaic sites in southwest Texas
(Weir, 1956: 62; Nunley and Hester, 1966: 249; Hester, 1967b: 6—7)

and it seems probable that they were used during much of the Archaic
period.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Five groups of projectile points have been described and illustrated.
The groups appear to be stylistically representative of the following
Paleo-Indian types: Angostura, Plainview, Plainview goloncirina,
Meserve, and Milnesand. These specimens occurred on the surface at
sites along San Miguel Creek in Frio, Atascosa and McMullen Counties
in southwestern Texas; they were accompanied by numerous artifacts
primarily attributable to Archaic occupations.
The possible late Paleo-Indian affiliation of the types mentioned
above has been suggested by many sources (Hughes, 1949; Davis,
1953; Wheeler, 1954; Suhm, Krieger and Jelks, 1954; Sellards, 1955;
Wormington, 1957; Johnson, 1964). Since the specimens discussed
here did occur in what seem to be predominantly Archaic sites, several
questions are posed. Do the Paleo-Indian projectile points represent
earlier (late Pleistocene) groups who camped at or near the same spot
later occupied by Archaic peoples? Did the Archaic inhabitants pick
up the Paleo-Indian points as curios or as sources of material? Or,
were these late Paleo-Indian forms made and used during the early
stages of the Archaic period in this area? These questions and other
problems presented by the presence of Paleo-Indian artifacts in Ar
chaic contexts have been discussed at length by Suhm, Krieger and
Jeiks (1954: 104—106) in regard to central Texas. In southwest Texas
(which includes Frio, Atascosa, and McMullen Counties), the author
has recorded nui-nerous Plainview (and Plainview golondrina) , Angos
tura, and Meserve specimens (Hester, 1967a: 3—8; ms., “A Distribu
tional Study of Paleo-Indian Projectile Points in Texas”). Most of
these occurred at large Archaic sites. Interestingly, Folsom and Clovis
points found in the same region also generally occur in an Archaic
context (Weir, 1956: 72; and, Hester, 1968: 117; “Paleo-Indian”
ms.). Since these early Paleo-Indian styles are found in this situation,
it would seem that either the Archaic peoples camped at (or near)
previous Paleo-Indian camping areas, thereby causing their materials
to become mixed through erosional processes, or the Archaic inhabi
tants were occasionally picking up the Paleo-Indian points and bring
ing them to their camps. The latter suggestion may account for the fact
that some of the Paleo-Indian specimens in the area have been re
worked into drills.
The non-Paleo-Indian assemblages at the San Miguel Creek sites
contain artifacts found in both central Texas and southwest Texas

Iuu

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Archaic sites (Suhm, Krieger and Jeiks, 1954: 108, 139, 141; Weir,
1956: 61—72; Nunley and Hester, 1966: 294). Tortugas is the domi
nant dart point type, but numerous stemmed and unstemmed points
are also found. The greatest uniformity is found among the nonprojectile point implements. TJnifacial and bifacial gouge-scrapers are
abundant, as are various forms of knives and scrapers.
At the present, the author does not know of an isolated Paleo-Indian
campsite in southwest Texas (as described by Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks, 1954: 134, and which consists of the counties of Frio, McMullen,
Atascosa, LaSalle, Zavala, Maverick, Diminit, Live Oak, Jim Wells,
Jim Hogg, Brooks, Starr, Hidalgo, Zapata and Webb); the Paleo
Indian specimens reported from the area thus far were found either
at random or on Archaic sites. Since discrete Paleo-Indian components
have been found in adjoining regions (Alexander, 1963; Johnson,
1964; Dibble, 1968), it is to be expected that they will eventually be
found here.

Suggestions to Authors
MAXINE AND JOEL SHINER

The ideas, hints and principles discussed in this article are presented
partly because they will make the work easier for the editor and partly
because they will help authors to communicate with their readers.
Most of these suggestions are quite standard for publication. There
may be some controversial ideas in the sections on classification and
interpretation, but, it is our firm belief that these are the modern trends
in anthropology.
In your typed manuscript underline those words or phrases that
you wish to appear in Italics in print. If you want them to appear
underlined in print, then you must so indicate in the margin of your
manuscript.
Illustrations are difficult and they involve a number of minor prob
lems. First of all, while the Bulletin page size is 6 x 9 inches, the
printed area is 4 5/16 x 7 inches. If the picture or map is upright, the
7 inch dimension roust include the caption. If the illustration is wider
than long, then it may be printed sideways on the full page. A third
way is to use a partial plate which is 4 5/16 inches wide and less than
7 inches high. Ordinarily, the plates are made up considerably larger
than life and are reduced by the printer. This process is especially
good on maps and other drawings, as it tends to diminish any shakiness
in the line work. If a plate is to be reduced to the effective page size of
4 5/16 x 7 inches, then the original size should be one of the following:
5” x 81/8”

6” x 93,4”
7”x 113/8”
8” x 13”
8,’” x 14”
Essentially, most of the photographs received by the editor have
been quite good. There are a series of accepted standards or at least
standard operating procedures in the illustration of artifacts.
1. Points usually are shown with the bases down and the tips up.
2. Scrapers and other tools are shown with the bulb of percussion
(or striking platform) down.
3. Cores are shown with the platform up, though many Texas cores
show multiple platforms.
4. Cross lighting on the picture should come from the upper left,
so that the shadows are on the lower right side of the artifacts.

164

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

There are two main difficulties in the photography of artifacts. The
first concerns the illustration of very light and very dark artifacts in
the same plate. This serious problem becomes almost insurmountable
when one does not have his own darkroom. The answer then is to take
separate shots at different exposures and cut out the artifact with
scissors or knife. This is rarely necessary since a good photographer
and printer can capture most artifacts on the same plate. A substitute
scheme for very white artifacts is to paint the surface with opaque
water colors or tempera. So what if the final picture shows the artifact
a little darker than life.
The second major problem iii artifact photography is shadows in
the background. If one has a light table the problem is minimized.
If not, the picture may be taken close to a window with light (not
direct sunlight) coming across the artifacts from upper left. The arti
facts and the unobtrusive scale are placed on clear glass with a white
background spread a foot or two below the glass. This technique per
mits one to use the whole print and not go through with the scissors
procedure which often as not nips off serrated edges.
It is always a good idea, if you cannot have custom enlargements
made, to send your negatives along with the manuscript. Also, in the
case of maps and drawings, send in the original, not a photostat.
Standard procedure should be followed in the analysis of artifacts.
One should not introduce new type names into the literature unless
he can satisfy three conditions.
1. This type has not been named and described satisfactorily by
someone else. If minor adjustments are made in the description,
a new name is not warranted.
2. The description includes accurate temporal and geographic limits
for the distribution of the type.
3. There should be some scientific purpose in naming a new type
and not just a desire to see one’s own name associated with a new
type.
If you have an artifact which does not “fit,” it is better to describe
it than to give it a geographical type name.
In general, we have a workable system of local names for projectile
points and pots. There is a serious theoretical problem, however, in
giving place-name terminology to such tools as scrapers, knives and
gouges. Even if the first prerequisites of naming were met, I would
still ask why one would want to burden the world with another named
type. There is a perfectly adequate system of dealing with scrapers,
and it includes the use of such names as side, end, and transverse plus
such descriptive adjectives as straight, convex etc. The classification

I

has worked quite well for years just about everywhere and each reader
knows quite well what each writer means in terms of shape and process
of manufacture. I am sure that similar descriptive terminology could
be used for gouges, knives and other tools.
A graph is a dramatization of a statement of significance. In an age
where we are accustomed to seeing distortions of fact or meaning
through the use of statistics on television, let us not be tricked by the
same thing in archeology. An example of the worst sort of the mean
ingless statistic is the bar or other graph that expresses percentages of
specimens in each of four levels when there are only 8 or 10 total
specimens. Unless there is a significant number of specimens this
presentation is pure distortion.
The next problem is a little different from the others although it
again deals with terminology. There are several terms in the southwest
that seem to have multiple meanings. I doubt that anything can be
done about it but the word blade has so many meanings that each
author had better explain his own meaning. The editor prefers the
meaning of a long, parallel sided piece that is detached from a core.
Knife is a word that has been abused almost as much as blade. There
is no hope of establishing much agreement except that it is a group of
things and the word should never be used as a taxonomic type. A
primary flake is a cortex flake and nothing more. An artifact is some
thing made by man and it may be a flake, a core or a tool. The word
does not refer only to points, scrapers, drills and so on.
A site report should deal with all of the recovered material, not just
the tools, and especially not just the projectile points. Probably it is
true that in most of Texas, projectile points are the single most valu
able asset in assigning a site to a focus, and in establishing a sequence
(of projectile points), but other artifacts must be reported as well.
Chips, flakes and cores are equally symptoms of behavio:-. It is the
duty of the archaeologist to at least save all of the artifacts even if he
has not the training to classify them.
The most difficult section of an archeological report is the conclu
sions. A summary is easy, but only the original excavator can really
do the job of making conclusions. The average report goes too far or
not far enough in saying something about the people that occupied his
site. A deduction that the site belongs to a specific focus is not a con
clusion, nor is a decision regarding its temporal position. One of the
simplest of conclusions would be remarks on how the people solved
their problems of making a living, observing their particular customs,
and how they got along with their neighbors.
One should not stretch the data. A report I have read told of finding

1 bO

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

two pottery types in a pithouse and concluded that it was a meeting of
two cultures. Another concluded that because there were points nor
mally associated with two foci, there had to have .been two occupations
of the site. Beware of migrations bringing new Indians with a new
point type. Beware of the exceptionally complex explanations of
situations.
In summary, typology should be a tool that is used to pry informa
tion out of your data, especially the artifacts. One should not make
classification his goal, nor should one be led around by his nose by his
typological system. The aim of a site report is to communicate to
interested persons what it was that you found and what you think it
all means. In this case typology is used because there are too many
specimens to permit individual illustration and description. At the
next step up, dealing with placing your site in a larger framework it
is not enough to classify it into its (proper?) focus or aspect. You are
obligated to say something about the people.

Book Review
Three Prehistoric Sites near Cedar Bayou, Galveston Bay Area.
J. RICHARD AMBLER. State Building Commission Archeology
Program Report Number 8, State Building Commission, Austin,
1967. ii+83 pp., 23 figs., 5 tables. Si .96.
Three small shell middens on Cedar Bayou near Galveston Bay in
Southeastern Texas were tested as part of a continuing archeological
program of the State Building Commission of Texas. An initial survey
had previously indicated the presence of these and several other sites
in the area. With the pressing danger of destruction by industrial
expansion, it was decided to investigate some of these sites with the
hope of accumulating more data about this little known area of Texas.
Consequently, a two week period in the spring of 1967 was spent in
limited test excavation.
The amount of artifactual material recovered was small; certainly
a reflection of the quantity of dirt actually moved. The combined yield
of the three sites totaled less than 5,000 artifacts, of which over 4,200
were potsherds. Stone, bone, and other clay artifacts were present in
minimal quantities. Surprising was the lack of mention of any shell
artifacts. Over 87 percent of the cultural material came from the
Wright Site (41 HR 50) which proved to be the most prolific of the
three and which, consequently, received the most attention.
The report is essentially descriptive, and as is customary in such
studies, analysis and interpretation are held to a minimum. The en
vironmental setting is discussed in some detail, but no attempt is made
to isolate specific biotopes nor to relate the sites to the physiography.
This section would certainly have benefited by an awareness of rele
vant geographical-archeological work done by Mclntire (1958) and
Saucier (1963) in adjoining areas of the Louisiana Coast.
The limited amount of time available for excavation greatly re
stricted the quantity of data collected. No evidence of house patterns,
hearths, or other features (except for two “pits” which may have only
been natural depressions) was unearthed. The significant result of
the digging was a sample of potsherds which may prove to relate to an
early ceramic tradition of Southeastern Texas. This utilitarian sand
tempered ware is stratigraphically and absolutely the earliest pottery
thus far found in Texas, but it apparently had an extremely long
temporal range of pernaps two millennia

i

oo

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

As far as I am aware, there has been little effort on the part of
workers in this area to deal with the decorative attributes of such wares
other than to simply describe them. Although I definitely favor tech
nological analysis of ceramics, I feel that the “limited time” available
for analysis of salvaged materials could perhaps be better spent in
vestigating stylistic changes in decoration, which have elsewhere
proven to be the most sensitive indicators of a continually dynamic
cultural milieu. Certainly separation of pottery classes on the basis of
temper, especially sand with its tremendous temporal span, can tell us
next to nothing about cultural preferences or processes. I am not main
taining that certain extreme cases of temper do not show a preference
on the part of the individual potter or perhaps even style whims of a
local or extended group, but until we can demonstrate that sand was
intentionally added as temper by analysis of local clay sources, it
seems more feasible to concentrate on other attributes.
Artifacts other than potsherds were rather scarce and nondistinctive.
Some stone projectile points—dart and arrow point types, stone tools
—a drill and retouched and use-retouched flakes, and bone tools—
socketed projectile points, awls, ulna tools, bipointed objects, fishhooks (?), and smoothed antler and bone pieces constitute the artifact
inventory. This assemblage is not diagnostic in terms of outlining
discrete cultural or temporal units. However, it is useful in conjunc
tion with the identified faunal remains in indicating that the makers
of these tools were active in exploiting several microhabitats.
Floors of the trenches and of the isolated test units were lowered in
arbitrary 10 centimeter levels. Ambler indicated that this caused some
problems in correlating levels in different units, but acknowledged that
it “did not unduly inconvenience the interpretations.”
Underlying the pottery-bearing levels at all three sites were layers
of Rangia shell which may relate as Ambler has suggested, to a pre
ceramic occupation. However, paucity of artifactual material in these
levels certainly negates a conclusive statement. Higher in the stratigraphic sequence after a “haitus” marked by a more or less discernible
layer of sterile clay at all the sites were additional shell accumulations
predominately Rangia with small quantities of oyster. However, site
41 HR 59 contained far more oyster in this level than the other two
sites, which may indicate that this layer accumulated during a period
of deteriorating environmental conditions, i.e., increasing salinity due
to subsidence or sea level encroachment In either case, it is possible to
postulate that this level does not correspond in time to the two other
stratigraphic sections, and from the greater percentage of sherd tern
pered pottery it appears that occupation here was somewhat later

Capping most areas of these middens was a soil or depositional layer
probably originally sterile of aboriginal artifacts but now mixed with
modern trash by recent pot-hunting activity.
If we can project the data accumulated by Mclntire (1958) in his
survey of coastal Louisiana into the Cedar Bayou area, it appears that
the environmental conditions revealed by the faunal aggregate more
nearly correspond to those encountered on the Louisiana coast during
the Troyville to Plaqueniine span. Ca. 800—1300 A.D.
Ambler compares the Cedar Bayou ceramics to other sand tempered
wares from Southeastern Texas. I question his choice of treating the
potsherds of all levels of all sites as a single block of comparative data.
Even considering the infancy of the state of knowledge about this area
of Texas, such a decision is not in the direction of clarifying areal,
temporal, and intersite relationships.
Sites producing similar pottery are discussed. Twelve miles north
east of Cedar Bayou at Wallisville Reservoir are a series of sites investi
gated by Harry Shafer (1966). A large nurnb€r of radiocarbon dates
have shown that the earliest pottery, a predominantly plain sand
tempered ware with apparent Tchefuncte affinities, first appeared
about 150 A.D. It continued relatively unchanged until Ca. 500 A.D.
when incised decorations seem to have been introduced. Ambler sug
gests that the Cedar Bayou pottery is more indicative of the post-S 00
AD. Wallisville material than of the earlier ceramics. Comparisons
with Goose Creek and Rockport wares from the Addicks Basin (Wheat
1953) about 40 miles east of Cedar Bayou, indicate a similar degree
of correspondence. Similarities are also noted with the sand tempered
type, Bear Creek Plain (Jelks 1967: 3—7), which is the common
“early” type of the area around McGee Bend some 100 miles inland
from Cedar Bayou. The upshot of Ambler’s discussion is that there
appears in Southeast Texas a long-lived, sand tempered pottery con
tinuum which is distinctive from the sherd or bone tempered “Cad
doan” ceramics.
Judging from the illustrations of the pottery from the Wright Site,
I am inclined to agree with Ambler’s post-500 A.D. dating of this
material and would even suggest a post-l000 AD. assignment. The
decorative motifs can be duplicated in collections from practically
contiguous areas to the east in Louisiana, from Pecan Island (Wau
chope 1947: 186—188) to Bayou Cutler (Kriiffen 1936: 407—422).
Inspiration for this set of designs certainly came from the late Coles
Creek “complex” of the delta and coastal region of Louisiana. The
entire range of decoration is most characteristic of the ill-defined tran
sitional period between Coles Creek and Plaquemine after Floridian

influences (as seen in French Fork Incised and Pontchartrain Check
Stamped) appear to have lessened and before Moundvillian connec
tions were established. Extrapolating from a group of radiocarbon
dates assembled by Mclntire (1958: 107), this appears to have oc
curred sometime during a span from 800 to 1590 A.D. and most prob
ably about 1200 AD. Allowing for time lag, it is supposed that the
Cedar Bayou occupants were incising similar designs on their pots
somewhat after this date.
Although Ambler does not specifically refer to site function, it is
evident from the raw data that the sites were living areas, probably
occupied seasonally by small groups of semi-nomadic hunters, fishers
and gatherers. Ambler’s references to inconsistency of cultural strata
within the sites or within one set of squares, the generally separate
accumulations of refuse, and the vertical mixing of cultural material
even to the point of being able to partially reconstruct vessels from
varying squares and levels, all point to the probability of light inter
mittent occupation with considerable accompanying soil disturbance.
That the sites were not just hunting camps is evident from the artifact
assemblages which include not only weapons and tools, normally
associated with the typical masculine pursuit of hunting, but also
such articles as pottery and bone bodkins ordinarily considered to
represent feminine handicrafts. Since site areas were not delimited nor
were house patterns, hearths, or functionally-specific use areas un
covered, the size and implied social organization of the occupant
groups remains questionable. Economic orientation was certainly
geared to the exploitation of several microenvironments. Faunal re
mains attest to activity in various paludal zones such as marine bays
or tidal flats (oyster), brackish estuaries (Rangia), and fresh-water
distributaries (turtle, alligator, gar, drum). Economic attention was
also channeled into other less moist biotopes such as the wooded
natural levees where deer and a variety of small animals (raccoon,
rabbit, squirrel, opposum) were taken and coastal prairies which pro
videcl bison, gopher, and cotton rat. It is probably safe to assume,
although there is no direct evidence, that considerable use was made
of various vegetable, fruit, and mast crops from each of these zones.
In essence, this group of sites appears to have functioned as more or
less intermittently or seasonally occupied base camps from which
forays were extended into diverse ecological areas in quest of sub
sistence.
These sites are valuable in that they have furnished additional evi
dence about a little-known area, period, and ceramic tradition of
Southeast Texas. The existence of this unique tradition has only

iI I

recently been acknowledged by Texas archeologists, and growin
g con
cern has been delegated sites in this area endangered by
industrial
installations, reservoir projects, and land-clearing operations. Such
must justify the simple amassing of data and indeed of salvage
arche
ology itself. When and if comprehensive syntheses of this
portion of
Texas are written, the Cedar Bayou sites will certainly play an import
ant role in the elucidation of the culture history.
The very nature of salvage archeology in most cases negates
ade
quate sampling, and hurried publication often precludes the
full utili
zation of the collected data. Ambler is to be commended for his report,
considering the limitations within which he worked. Certainly
exca
vation of natural strata where possible would have assiste
d in stratigraphic interpretation if only to provide a test for corrobation.
The
possibilities for ceramic analysis were by no means exhausted
by
Ambler, and the full implications of the complex of decorative
motifs
were not realized. The comparative studies likewise suffere
d by not
including pertinent data which have been collected by worker
s in the
areas to the north (Marshall, Texas) and east (Louisiana Gulf
Coast)
of Cedar Bayou.
The quality of the report is generally good. Type is uniformly clear,
but poor reproduction has blurred the location map and several of
the
graphs of pottery di:tribution. Justification of bottom margins
would
certainly have added to the overall appearance. More careful editing
would have undoubtedly eliminated some of the wordiness especia
lly
evident in the section of “Acknowledgments”, and perhaps reduce
d
some of the grammatical and typographical errors. However, these
factors are relatively minor when compared with the potential useful
ness of this report as a source of data. It is certainly to be recommended
to those archeologists interested in this particular region, as it repre
sents one of the initial steps toward the understanding of the arche
ology of Southeast Texas.
