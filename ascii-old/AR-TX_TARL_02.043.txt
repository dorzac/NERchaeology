ABSTRACT
The field investigations described here are not “modern” in the sense of early 21st century research. But
“modernity,” a concept that keeps slipping into the past, once referred to some of these earlier investigations that
are now removed by degrees from contemporary research. Curation repositories continue accumulating collections of all sorts—some excellent in their documentation and significance—that are what remains from the previously exploited archeological record. And so, a continuing dimension of modern research entails stitching together older collections to squeeze from them findings that are valuable in light of contemporary archeological
knowledge and interests.
Six decades ago T. N. Campbell identified the need to clarify culture history of southeast Texas-southwest
Louisiana and its correlation with the better-known prehistory of adjacent areas of the upper Texas coast and
south Louisiana. Since then research has roughed out the Paleoindian through Late Archaic culture history in the
Sabine. The investigations reported here continue preliminary organization of the area’s archeology by examining
curated public and private collections made over five decades from nine sites that contain early ceramic components.
Chronology: Ceramic collections from seven sites were seriated with controls based on a combination of
stratigraphic succession, pattern development and by a few radiocarbon dates indicating the early ceramic cultures in the Sabine are chronologically bracketed between 2500 BP to a time somewhat earlier than 1300 BP. The
earlier part of this time, characterized by Tchefuncte-related pottery, is named the Orange Period and the successor ceramic assemblage, associated more with occasional Marksville-related pottery, is named the Big Hill Period.
Site Formation: Site formation was documented at Black Hill Mound, Pipkin Ranch, and Gaulding. The
latter two have been published elsewhere but give compelling evidence that some Gulf Coast pimple mounds are
aggradational features incorporating archeological zones (e.g., Pipkin) and that the formation of streamside shell
sites (e.g., Gaulding) in the Sabine is likely to be strongly influenced by small-scale sea level fluctuations. Formation data are given here for Black Hill Mound which appears to be a mound built upon a Middle Archaic midden,
then periodically elevated with mortuary and early ceramic midden layers, and then partially engulfed by sediment
transported down slope toward Hillebrandt Bayou adjacent to the mound location.
Settlement Patterns: There are three kinds of early ceramic sites currently identified—earth middens, brackish water shell sites, and mortuary sites. The former two site types primarily represent habitation locations. The
Orange Period sites have a greater quantity and diversity of artifacts than the later Big Hill Period sites (a relationship similar to the Galveston Bay area early ceramic sites) possibly indicating more intensive habitation as in base
camps. The two mortuary sites, with their unusual construction suggest ritual activities in the Sabine of greater
material complexity than in the Galveston Bay and other coastal areas to the southwest. The Black Hill Mound’s
structure is also suggestive of similarities to the Lafayette mounds in south-central Louisiana.
Technology: Particular focus was applied to learning more about ceramic vessel form. Orifice diameters
were smallest on Goose Creek Plain, unspecified variety, and on the two Baytown Plain varieties while the majority of O’Neal Plain, variety Conway, and the two Tchefuncte Plain varieties had larger mouth diameters. Upper
body shapes were reduced to “restricted” and “unrestricted” forms. Two-thirds of all recorded rims had unrestricted upper bodies and the ratio of restricted to unrestricted vessels was about the same for both Orange Period
and Big Hill Period collections.
Although base sherds were much more rare, flat bases are by far the most common, noded bottoms are next
most frequent, and other shapes were very minor in occurrence. As with upper body forms, base form proportions
were similar for both Orange and Big Hill periods. There was almost no evidence of sooty or charred accumulations on sherds suggesting that pottery vessels were not used directly over fire for cooking at this time. Given the
absence of cobbles or clay balls for stone boiling, ceramic vessels in the Sabine may have been used seldom, if at
all, for cooking but rather as storage containers for other wet and dry materials.
The transition from darts with relatively large biface lithic points (and, for that matter, socketed bone points
as well) to a very limited dart point assemblage accompanied by introduction of a small assemblage of biface
xiv

arrow points apparently occurred in the transition from the Orange Period to the Big Hill Period. Some Orange
Period biface dart points were reworked from large Early and Middle Archaic points possibly scavenged from
much older sites in the Sabine. The collections contained an abundance of lithic flakes, broken tools, preforms,
and so on, permitting an initial reconstruction of the biface manufacturing process as it was employed during the
early ceramic. A host of other utilitarian, ornamental, and possibly ritual artifacts were recovered with their
greatest abundance and variety from collections attributable to the Orange Period.
Subsistence: Faunal remains were recovered and documented from three of the early ceramic sites. These
combined with previously published data give a preliminary sense of vertebrate usage for that time. The major
trends are a decline in the use of white-tailed deer and a significant increase in the use of small terrestrial-aquatics
(especially turtles) at the end of the Taylor Bayou Period (Late Archaic) going in to the beginning of the Orange
Period. The Orange Period was also a time when the use of fish, alligators, and small terrestrial animals declined.
The very limited data from the Big Hill Period suggests it was a time of transition in vertebrate subsistence.
Relative to the preceding Orange Period, capture of deer, alligators, and turtles again seem to increase but may
decline again going into the as yet undefined late ceramic times. In the late ceramic, though, there appears to be a
very large increase in the use of fish—much greater than in the preceding periods described above.
Mortuary Practices: Over the last century occasional local newspaper accounts have reported the presence
of many human skeletons in large shell mounds being quarried near the mouth of the Neches River. In addition,
two sparsely documented early ceramic sites convey significant evidence about mortuary practices in the Sabine.
Located on the western frontier of the Atakapa territory, the solitary Black Hill Mound (Archaic to Orange Period)
contained a few interments accompanied by grave goods, was circular and dome-shaped, and likely was intended
to be a noticeable landmark, possibly as a territorial boundary.
The Dredge site, of either late Orange Period or Big Hill Period age, is an entirely different manner of
structure. Situated in the heart of occupied western Atakapa territory, it was an earthen platform built atop a
moderate-sized shell mound and was the place of interment of several dozen individuals. Burials in this cemetery
included many grave goods. Unusual among the interments was an apparent trophy head—an adult male skull
placed on a large slab of sandstone. The abundance of grave goods and special mortuary treatments in these two
sites seem to imply that a particular status was required to be interred at those locations.
Taken together this evidence may begin to suggest the outline of mortuary practices in the Sabine. In the
center of the heavily inhabited lower Neches River was a cemetery possibly for high status people at the Dredge
site. Elsewhere in the center of this territory the people of lesser status may have been interred in large numbers in
mounded shell middens. Lower status people dying while away from the center may have been interred as isolated
burials in peripheral locations such as were discovered at the Gaulding and Eddleman sites. And people of higher
status dying while away from the center may have been buried in locations like the Black Hill structure giving a
special or even sacred status to a possible territorial boundary mound. At least this is an interpretive concept that
may be testable if replicated in the future.
Areas to the north and east of the Sabine are well known for their large ceremonial structures and implications of complex ceremonialism. In the Sabine there is an emerging image of simpler ceremonial structures in the
western Atakapa territory, and even greater simplicity in the mortuary ritual of the Galveston Bay Area—territory
of the Akokisa. These circumstances may suggest, as one focus for future investigation, that the nature of the
Mossy Grove Tradition of the northern Gulf coast is in delineating the final marginal dilution of Woodland culture
at its southwestern limit.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The authors owe many debts to a multitude of people who have assisted us over the years. Foremost among
these was our good friend, Sol Aronow, late professor of geology at Lamar University. Sol took a keen interest in
our work, including that reported in the present volume, and was always ready to help solve problems and add to
our understanding. We miss him greatly.
We are especially pleased to acknowledge our obligation to Dee Ann Story, former director of the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), from whom we have benefited continuously by her friendship, counsel,
encouragement, and assistance. We also wish to thank Thomas R. Hester, former director of TARL, and Darrell
Creel, present director of TARL, the premier archeological repository at The University of Texas at Austin, as
well as Laura Nightingale, TARL Head of Collections, and Carolyn Spock, TARL Head of Records, for ensuring
access to numerous unparalleled collections and records relevant to the Sabine Lake Area.
Our debt to Dr. Charles D. Eddleman is immense for generously making available the notes, photographs,
and specimens from his excavations at site 41OR49 that he assiduously protected for more than four decades. Dr.
Eddleman was assisted in his work at 41OR49 by James Heard, Larry Stephens, and Harold Herrington, and was
given permission to excavate by Mr. Burch, the lessee of the property.
We are grateful for access to the Bairds Bayou collection curated at Texas A&M University Department of
Anthropology (TAMU) and for the assistance of curator Patricia Clabaugh. Without repositories such as at
TAMU and TARL dedicated to the long-term protection and preservation of archeological collections of whatever
age and source, far fewer opportunities would exist for revisiting collections reported—no matter how well—in
the past, for regional synthesis, and for pioneering or unconventional research.
Testing at Pipkin Ranch was made possible by the permission given to Charles N. Bollich by landowner
Bruce Pipkin. In the 1970 test excavation at Pipkin Ranch site 41JF31B we were assisted by Professor Sol
Aronow on geomorphology, Billy M. Davidson on ecology, and James McMichael, Robert Cole, Glen Fredlund,
Andrew and Paul Bollich, and T. Bonsall with the excavation.
We could not have made much progress toward understanding Black Hill Mound without the assistance and
encouragement from Lorraine Heartfield Green in explaining what was done there in the 1960’s. Also helping sort
out that site was Professor Aronow. John R. Schwarzlose, Richard and Jay Cockrell, and Jody Cammack aided
with field work at Black Hill in 2003; former Beaumont City Manager Stephen J. Bonczek approved our request
to conduct the investigation on city property, and the Texas Historical Commission administered Texas Antiquities Permit 2902 allowing us to work at Black Hill. We also acknowledge the late Professor Russell J. Long, of
Lamar University, who held the majority of ceramics recovered at the site in the 1960s, and later turned these over
to C. N. Bollich for study and curation.
We also wish to thank Richard A. Weinstein of Coastal Environments, Inc., for generously advising us
during our initial review of Tchefuncte and Marksville-related ceramics from the Eddleman site. We also warmly
appreciate Dee Ann Story’s assistance during our initial review of chipped stone from the Eddleman site. And we
thank W. T. Block, eminent local historian, for providing us with background information and copies of some of
his numerous publications as well as information on burial sites reported in early newspaper accounts, and on a
Marksville ceramic vessel found at Johnson’s Bayou in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

INVESTIGATING EARLY CERAMIC SITES NEAR
SABINE LAKE
INTRODUCTION
Nearly a half century ago the late Professor T. N.
Campbell, a pioneer of Texas coastal archeology, concluded his analysis of Bolivar Peninsula’s Caplen site
(1957) by observing:
“What is needed in the western Atakapan area
is more investigation in the coastal strip lying
between Galveston Bay and the Sabine River,
so that the western part of the Atakapan area
may be tied in with the eastern and hence with
the cultural sequence of the Lower Mississippi
Valley.”

This plea has been renewed periodically, most recently by Ricklis (2004:202), and that, as a basic step
toward organizing archeological information, is what
the investigation reported here pursues. We seek to identify a preliminary concept of time, space, and ancient
culture for early ceramic sites in the Sabine Lake and
western Atakapan areas.
This study also continues a recent trend toward
documenting and analyzing public and private archeological collections made over many years at various
locations on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico
where it straddles the shared state boundary of Texas
and Louisiana (Figure 1). Private collections comprising hundreds of mostly Paleo-Indian to Middle Archaic
lithic tools found on the Gulf beach between Sabine
Pass and High Island have been reported by Stright
and others (1999). That valuable investigation was followed by a study of the principally Late Archaic
Gaulding and related sites in the Taylor Bayou drainage
basin immediately west of Sabine Lake—fieldwork principally accomplished in the 1960s and 1970s, and augmented in the 1990s (Aten and Bollich 2002). Now,
through time and fortuitous circumstance, several excavated or otherwise time-controlled collections con-

taining early ceramics are available. While none of these
sites and data were documented as they would be today, and some materials have been inadvertently misplaced, they nevertheless illustrate that there are latent
uses to be made of curated collections from work accomplished long ago.
In the present study, collections made principally
from nine archeological sites over the last five decades
are used to begin defining the unique technological characteristics of successive early ceramic cultures of the
Sabine Lake Area—i.e., those dating from around the
middle first millennium BC to the middle first millennium AD, or perhaps later (Figure 2). Generally speaking, these are sites and artifact assemblages that roughly
correlate with, and show relationships to, the Tchefuncte
and Marksville cultures of the Lower Mississippi Valley
and south Louisiana to the east, and with the Clear
Lake and Mayes Island Periods of the Galveston Bay
Area to the west (Aten 1983; McIntire 1958).
Now, although the research questions that can be
pursued with this material in the Sabine are limited and
often are not hypothesis driven, further progress can
be made at organizing and correlating a culture-historical framework in the Sabine. This formulation of early
ceramic cultures is preliminary because it has available
only a minimum of the high precision dating, faunal,
and geoarcheological analyses that would have significantly amplified the picture of these cultures.
Since little radiocarbon information is available,
that chronological method is being supplemented with
graphic seriation because of the relative abundance of
ceramics in these collections. Although graphic seriation is now a rather outdated technique, better alternatives are not yet available for studying Sabine collections, and in any event it can be used here with some
confidence because it can be controlled by comparisons to ceramic sequences in the Galveston Bay Area
and in south Louisiana. From past research (Aten and

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

Bollich 1969, 2002) and by various investigations in
Galveston Bay Area, it was expected that early ceramic
assemblages in the Sabine would resemble in some respects the Tchefuncte and Marksville assemblages of
south Louisiana mixed with a substantial proportion of
indigenous southeast Texas types such as the sandy
paste and the grog-tempered sandy paste varieties.
A generalized attempt at a ceramic chronology
for the Sabine was attempted some years ago (Aten
and Bollich 1969). While that study indicated the basic
pattern and the direction one would go to further refine
the area’s culture-chronology based on ceramics, just
how these would appear as an archeological assemblage could not be anticipated until now. In addition,
the currently available collections include a relatively
large number of oriented rims and bases that give an
initial impression of the vessel forms in use.
Some of the collections presented here also have—
for coastal sites—relatively large numbers of chipped
stone projectile points and tools as well as chipping
debris. These lithic tool kits are described and to a limited degree are distinguished from the Late Archaic on
the one hand and from the Late Ceramic on the other
(cf. Figure 2). There also are faunal collections available from three of the sites and some information about
mortuary practices, settlement patterns, and
geoarcheology that also are brought into the synthesis.
LANDSCAPE SETTING
Landscape, particularly in low gradient coastal
zones like that of the northern Gulf of Mexico, is the
backdrop against which a resident prehistoric culture
develops, and landscape stability or alteration can have
a great influence upon culture change (see Aten
1983:Figure 8.12). The landscape characteristics of the
Sabine Lake region (for simplicity often referred to here
as just “the Sabine”) as they pertain to Native American settlement, have been reviewed lately (Aten and
Bollich 2002:3–4) and will not be repeated here except
in their broadest outline.
As recently as Paleo-Indian times—10,000 to
13,000 years before present (BP)—the upland coastal
prairies extended much farther south on terrain now
inundated by the elevated post-glacial Gulf sea level.
The Sabine Lake did not exist and the major streams
(the Neches and Sabine rivers) and their principal tributaries (e.g., Taylor Bayou; Black Bayou; et al.) were
much more entrenched (see Aten and Bollich 2002:Fig-

ure 29).
However, the region’s environmental zones, by
two to three millennia ago when the early ceramic sites
described here were in use, did not radically differ from
their characteristics today. They consist of four coast
parallel habitats (cf. Figure 1). Beginning at the Gulf
shore these are the Gulf beaches, the coastal marshes,
the upland or coastal prairie, and the interior woodlands. Every few tens of kilometers these coast-parallel
zones are cut across by the broad floodplains of streams
draining the interior and consisting of extensive swamps
and both freshwater and brackish marshes. In the immediate Sabine Lake Area these major streams are the
Neches and Sabine rivers both of which empty into the
north end of Sabine Lake and ultimately into the Gulf
of Mexico through Sabine Pass. To the east 50 km is
the Calcasieu River, and 84 km to the west is the Trinity River/Galveston Bay complex. Although Sabine Lake
resembles an estuary, it has so much freshwater inflow,
is so shallow, and has such a small outlet to the Gulf,
that only a small area near the outlet has estuarine characteristics (White et al. 1987:Plate V).
While the geography of early ceramic times may
have broadly resembled that of today, recent investigations have begun to document relatively minor changes
in Gulf sea level during recent millennia that probably
had a significant impact on the discoverability of settlement patterns over the past 2,000 to 3,000 years or so
(Aten and Bollich 2002:Figure 30; Marquardt and
Walker 2001:58–60; Stapor et al. 1991). Specifically,
Tchula Period (or Tchefuncte culture) sites would have
been occupied when sea level and local stream levels
were a meter or so lower than at present. This low sea
level period, the Sanibel I low, would make many contemporaneous sites difficult to observe during the conventional site surveys performed today. Throughout the
succeeding Wulfert high phase, sea level was perhaps
two meters or more higher than during Sanibel I. This
was the time Marksville culture was active and Sabine
area sites with Marksville ceramics would be preserved
at higher elevations and probably appear to be much
more numerous than sites with Tchefuncte artifacts.
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Prehistoric archeological sites near Sabine Lake
have been written about on and off for nearly two centuries (e.g., Darby 1816; Ripley 1875; Anonymous 1886;
and others). Throughout much of the 19th and 20th cen-

Chapter 1: Investigating Early Ceramic Sites Near Sabine Lake

turies shell mound sites were routinely quarried for use
in road construction and for other development purposes. This occasionally led to period newspaper accounts of the discovery of artifacts and, particularly, of
human skeletons (e.g., Block 1999). By the early 20th
century, though, local archeological sites were being
sought by artifact collectors.
While the Sabine still ranks among those sections
of the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico for which
information about prehistoric archeology is very limited, it is also among the region’s most thoroughly
searched-for archeological sites. Although sites there
apparently were not as abundant as in some other locations, nevertheless there once were many shell middens
and mounds, some of quite large size.
Strictly speaking, the first archeological synthesis
that included the Sabine was E. B. Sayles’ (1935) overview of Texas. In that study, archeological sites appearing to have an affinity with historic Indian groups
were given names based on those groups, at least for
the late prehistoric sites. And so, all the known sites in
the immediate coastal zone eastward to and beyond the
Texas-Louisiana border were identified as
“Karankawan.” Sites found on the coastal prairies and
interior woodlands from somewhere east of the Sabine
to inland of Galveston Bay were identified as
“Attacapan.” This scheme was based on very little archeological data and a greater amount of ethnohistorical
information newly available thanks mainly to the historian Herbert Bolton and his students early in the 20th
century. All in all, though, Sayles’ synthesis—while perhaps useful for very broadly sketching out trends of
cultural differentiation in southeast Texas—provided
little else. It may be, although this is only speculative,
that the paucity of data available to Sayles provided the
impetus for the burst of site survey fieldwork soon to
be carried out in southeast Texas.
Systematically documented archeological survey
in the Sabine Lake vicinity began with Works Progress
Administration sponsorship of Gus Arnold from the
University of Texas in 1939–40 (Im 1975). Soon after,
the first attempt at archeological synthesis along contemporary lines was undertaken by T. N. Campbell
(1947). After examining the Arnold collections, Campbell
observed that the “sand-tempered” (most of which today is called sandy paste) and “clay-tempered” (now
termed grog-tempered) wares typical of the coastal zone
(Orange and Jefferson counties) gave way in Hardin,
Jasper, and Newton counties to sand-tempered wares

5

more typical of early northeast Texas ceramics.
Campbell further pointed out that the collections
occasionally included Marksville incised or stamped
sherds and noted as well the similarity between coastal
incised pottery motifs and Coles Creek Incised motifs.
He concluded that the Sabine Lake Area culture history
was likely related to the Lower Mississippi Valley
(1947:289–291).
Since Arnold’s and Campbell’s time, surveys of
parts of the Sabine have been augmented every few
years. As a result, and even though there are still places
that need to be examined, much of the area’s shorelines and floodplains have been examined thoroughly—
in some places repeatedly—for the existence of archeological sites. In recent years, though, such surveys (e.g.,
McGuff and Roberson 1974; TARL site records) have
come to serve more to document site losses than site
discoveries. Most of the large sites in the area by now
have been quarried for their shell or were lost to 20th
century urban and industrial growth.
Today there is a continuing steady loss of the remaining smaller sites to erosion accelerated by expanding transportation and recreational uses of waterways,
to subsidence especially of floodplains and coastal
marshlands, and to land development. Now there is a
real prospect of losing, within perhaps only a decade or
two, much of the dwindling remnants of the archeological resources that are necessary to study the workings of the Sabine Lake Area’s 13,000 years of human
history.
EARLY CERAMIC CULTURES AND THE
MOSSY GROVE TRADITION
From roughly the late 17th to middle 19th centuries, the Sabine Lake vicinity—straddling the historical
boundary separating French Louisiana and Spanish
Texas—was known as the westerly limit of the Western Atakapa tribal territory (Aten 1983:38–39; Kniffen
et al. 1987:46; Newcomb 1961:315). The Atakapa, along
with their neighbors the coastal Akokisa and interior
Bidai tribes (Figure 1), were among the populations
whose cultures formed the southwestern periphery of
the Southeastern United States culture area (Aten 1984;
Campbell 1947:291; Wheat 1953).
While maintaining their separate ethnic identities,
these three groups, and undoubtedly some as yet unidentified others, shared for an extended time period
many cultural, technological, and linguistic similarities

6

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

that were more or less distinct from the surrounding
ethnic groups. As a result it can be useful at times to
treat them as a group and for this purpose Prof. Dee
Ann Story suggested the name “Mossy Grove Tradition” (Story 1990:256–258; Moore 1995; Moore and
Donachie 2001; Aten and Bollich 2002), a usage similar to that of Goggin (1949).
Mossy Grove tribes occupied coastal marshes, the
coastal plain, and some of the adjacent interior woodlands of southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana. The
eastward extent of the Mossy Grove Tradition is not
yet known but a good guess is that it probably coincided with the territorial boundary between the Eastern
and Western Atakapa, or roughly the east side of the
Calcasieu River and Lake. To the southwest and west
they were bounded by nomadic tribes of the prairies; to
the north and east by sedentary or semi-sedentary agriculturalist/moundbuilders; and to the south by the Gulf
of Mexico. Standing on the Gulf shore looking out to
sea they probably never saw maritime peoples whereas
they surely knew that if they walked in any other direction far enough they would encounter other people. To
the Mossy Grove peoples the Gulf sea was an impassable barrier, perhaps even thought to be the edge of the
earth. Yet, if we can believe 19th and early 20th century
Galveston physician and amateur historian J. O. Dyer
(1917), the Atakapa origin myth had their first people
cast up from the sea in oyster shells.
Despite some Mossy Grove groups living parttime on the coast (i.e., seashore, coastal lagoons, estuaries, and marshlands), they were only slightly adapted
to these resources and environments. Indeed, they were
little more than scavengers along the seashore, while
somewhat more skilled at using the coastal lagoons and
estuaries, and relatively more so in the coastal marshes.
There they obviously gathered wild plant products, about
which we have very little information, prodigious quantities of shellfish—mostly Rangia cuneata—did some
fin fishing, and relatively more hunting of small to large
animals. While there must have been very large quantities of fish in the sea and estuaries, relatively few of
their bones are found in Mossy Grove archeological
sites. They apparently lived a seasonally transhumant
life including spending some of their time on the periphery of agricultural tribes where they may have bartered for produce.
Mossy Grove peoples apparently had some watercraft for use in streams, lakes, and estuaries (Barroto
1987:178; Dyer 1917) but not, so far as is known, for

excursions into the Gulf. Indeed, only one dugout canoe, on display (as of the printing of this publication) in
the Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin,
Texas, has been reported found near Mossy Grove territory—on the lower Brazos River. Mossy Grove archeological sites have yielded few heavy duty stone or
shell tools, such as axes and adzes that would be suitable for crafting a dugout canoe, and so it may be that
there was some watercraft use, but not a lot.
Insofar as it can be recognized at present, the
Mossy Grove Tradition (Figure 3) was reminiscent of
early Woodland cultures. Their ceramics usually were
sandy paste, sand-tempered, or grog-tempered. Their
vessel shapes were often spherical or conical jars and
bowls rarely decorated and then mainly by rudely executed geometric incising, rocker stamping, and rarely
cord-marking. Frequently sites were seen to contain
examples of Tchefuncte and Marksville material cultures: in particular certain pottery types. The lithic assemblages had limited variety in tool types and other
rudimentary tools and ornaments were made of stone,
bone, and shell. There likely were recognized territories through which people moved at various times of
year often to take advantage of seasonal or localized
resources.
While most of their ceremonial activities are not
archeologically visible, mortuary ritual seems to have
been simple with interments often in habitation sites no
longer in use. Perhaps, in some locations, small earthen
platforms were used for burial that may have devolved
from the conical mortuary mounds so common in the
eastern United States and found as near to the coastal
Sabine area as the Jonas Short site in San Augustine
County, Texas, the Coral Snake site in Sabine Parish,
Louisiana, and the Lafayette mounds of south Louisiana.
We may also note several elements of Southeastern Woodland cultures that are not present in the Mossy
Grove Tradition but can be seen in cultures directly to
the north and east of the Mossy Grove territory. These
would include horticulture and agriculture; platform
mounds; ceremonial centers and the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex; villages with moderately large sedentary populations; and manufacture of artistic objects
in clay, stone, bone, or shell. The most consistent external material culture reflections appearing in Mossy
Grove sites were small numbers of ceramics either from
or that imitated those of the Lower Mississippi Valley
and the Caddo area.

Chapter 1: Investigating Early Ceramic Sites Near Sabine Lake

Figure 3. Some Tchefuncte and Marksville early ceramics localities in proximity to the Sabine Lake Area: (1) Ponchartrain area; (2) Lafayette area; (3)
Marksville; (4) Russell Landing; (5) Coral Snake; (6) Resch; (7) Jonas Short;
(8) Galveston Bay Area (Tchefuncte only).

And so, among other things, the Mossy Grove
concept provides a distinctive culture-geographic term
serving the late prehistoric cultures of coastal southeast
Texas and southwest Louisiana in a manner similar to
how other culture areas nearby are distinguished such
as the Western Gulf Tradition, Caddo area, and Lower
Mississippi Valley.
But the cultural roots of the Mossy Grove Tradition may run deeper than the Late Prehistoric (Figure
2), and farther afield as well. A quarter of a century
ago, Shafer (1977) argued that if one looks at the technological assemblages rather than just diagnostic projectile points, it seemed that Paleo-Indian and early Archaic lithic assemblages of eastern Texas reflected hunting and gathering adaptations to resources and habitats
more characteristic of the eastern woodlands than of
classic big game hunters. This also was the conclusion
reached in investigations of early sites in nearby Wharton
County, Texas (Patterson and Hudgins 1983:10–18).
But even when not looking so far afield, eastern
affiliations may be evident. Recent study of the large
collections of Paleo-Indian and Archaic lithic tools found
on the Gulf beach between Sabine Pass and High Island also concluded that the technology of diagnostic
Paleo-Indian projectile points distinctively resembled
similarly aged artifacts from the eastern United States

7

rather than those of the west (Stright
et al. 1999:46). It should be remembered also that the early sites from
which these diagnostic points were
eroded would not have been created
in coastal landscapes but rather were
interior riverine and upland prairie terrains that have been inundated and buried by post-glacial rising sea level.
It may be that in time research
will show the origins of the Mossy
Grove ethnic groups, and perhaps of
their Archaic and Paleo-Indian ancestors, derive largely from prehistoric
cultures of the interior southeastern
United States. But, whether or not this
was so for the earliest prehistoric periods, it has been recognized, as discussed above, that certain similarities
do exist between Woodland cultures of
the southeastern U.S. and the Mossy
Grove cultures of central and southern
east Texas (cf. Aten 1984; Shafer et
al. 1975; Wheat 1953).
COLLECTIONS

These nine collections, including more than 6,000
sherds as well as numerous stone, bone, and shell tools
and ornaments, are most immediately identifiable because they usually include ceramics with distinctive
Tchefuncte and/or Marksville features as these are recognized in south Louisiana.
The largest collection to be examined here resulted
from the first systematic archeological excavation to be
conducted in the Sabine Lake Area; it was organized
and directed by C. D. Eddleman at 41OR49 in the late
1950s (Figure 1). While a brief note was published at
the time (Eddleman and Akersten 1966), the records
and artifacts have been carefully preserved over more
than four decades partly by C. D. Eddleman and partly
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
in Austin, Texas. A report on this early fieldwork is
included in the present volume with the assistance of
Dr. Eddleman.
In 1964, C. N. Bollich began his well-known survey, surface collecting, and limited testing at sites on
the lower Sabine and Neches floodplains and elsewhere
in the Sabine Lake area. Influenced by the method of

8

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

the lower Red River ceramic chronology formulated by
James A. Ford (1962), Bollich’s objective was to begin
defining a chronological framework for the post-Archaic coastal Sabine based on seriated pottery collections. Allied with Aten in 1966, they prepared a first
approximation of a ceramic chronology for the Sabine
in 1969 (Aten and Bollich 1969). Those collections have
been augmented to some extent since then, and materials selected for their relatively unmixed early ceramic
character are included in the present study. These include collections from Conway D (16CU108) just east
of the Sabine River, and the Baird’s Bayou site
(41OR34); see Figure 1.
Also, in the early to mid-1960s, students and faculty from what is now Lamar University began digging
into a small mound in the Hillebrandt Bayou drainage
basin known variously as Black Hill Mound or Tyrrell
Park Mound (Figure 1). Numerous artifacts were recovered, mostly early ceramics and lithics, along with
several human skeletons. Originally thought to be a prairie (pimple) mound, recent investigation (Aten and
Bollich 2004) now raises the possibility that it was a
constructed mound, perhaps a mortuary structure, although there also may be a Middle Archaic component
at the site. There is sufficient information and material
from this unusual site to determine that the ceramic
assemblage is mostly early, and so it is incorporated
into this study.
In 1965, the Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
held its annual field school at the Gaulding site (41JF27),
a shell site on Taylor Bayou a few miles south of Beaumont (Figure 1). Although analysis and reporting of this
site languished until the mid-1990s, it was recently published (Aten and Bollich 2002). The Taylor Bayou investigations mainly elaborate the Late Archaic but contribute to the early ceramic period as well.
In the later 1960s, Bollich discovered apparent
archeological deposits incorporated within the formation of pimple mounds on Pipkin Ranch near the Big
Hill salt dome. Small-scale stratigraphic testing in several mounds was carried out by Bollich and Aten to see
whether this could really be the case since, at that time,
no unequivocal field evidence for an aggradational origin of pimple mounds was documented on the northern
Gulf coast. The geological implication of this work has
been reported (Aten and Bollich 1981) but the archeological findings at three sites are included here for the
first time since they too represent the early ceramic

culture of the area.
We also have managed to piece together something of the story of what was an extraordinary archeological site, dubbed by us the Dredge site (41OR9), on
the lower Neches River (Figure 1). Now almost totally
destroyed, it once consisted of a moderately large shell
mound on top of which was perched a built earthen
burial platform. Ceramics jumbled together from both
the mound and the platform include some examples of
early ceramics. While the mortuary information we have
is not used quantitatively, it appears to be part of the
culture of the early ceramic times in the Sabine.
The principal material present at all of the sites
was an aggregate of more than 6,000 potsherds. The
majority of these sherds are of common ceramic types
and varieties found at most of the sites. In addition
there are numerous rare types or varieties that are best
described and understood in proximity to related types
and varieties. Thus to simplify presentation, to avoid
considerable redundant narrative, and to capitalize on
being able to see all the distinctive early ceramics together rather than scattered over all the site chapters,
the ceramics are described together in Appendix A with
only a summary statement included in each site chapter. Projectile points, while much fewer in number, are
described in Appendix B for the same reasons. Descriptions of all other artifacts are included separately
in their respective site chapters.
All artifacts were examined under a binocular microscope at 10× or 20× to identify paste constituents,
tool wear, mineral and rock types, lithic flake features,
manufacturing characteristics and such. Colors are given
in the Munsell system unless otherwise noted. While
most of the artifact descriptions—especially ceramics—
have been updated, there are some inconsistencies in
artifact descriptions because they were made in the distant past and obtaining the objects for re-examination is
not feasible.
Finally, most of the original field documentation
measurements used here were made decades ago in the
English system and we are reluctant to report information using only conversions to the metric system. Consequently, all measurements are used here as they were
originally made; where these are in the English system
the metric equivalent is given in parentheses. Where
only metric units are given, these are the original documentation.

Chapter 2

A LOCAL CHRONOLOGY FOR SABINE LAKE AREA
EARLY CERAMIC SITES

BACKGROUND
Having a concept of chronological context beyond
the generalization of “early ceramics” is a great help
when describing and discussing sites and their archeological collections in the following chapters. Ordinarily
the investigative findings from individual sites would be
described separately, but it is awkward to present the
site by site findings without any reference to their possible chronological relationships. So this presentation
will begin with a discussion of chronological evidence.
Fortunately, this can begin not too far in the dark
since the approximate age of early ceramic cultures on
the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico west of the
Mississippi River is known to be sometime in the range
of about 1500 to 2700 years BP, being a little earlier to
the east and a little later to the west (Figure 2). It is fair
to assume that Sabine area early ceramic sites must fit
within this range and it may be used to evaluate the
reasonableness of age estimates based on radiocarbon
or other means.
RADIOCARBON DETERMINATIONS
Eight radiocarbon dates have been determined on
samples believed to be either attributable to early ceramic archeological deposits in the Sabine or to bracket
them closely (Table 1). Of the five samples expected to
directly date early ceramic deposits, four fall very wide
of the mark, the “mark” being the range from 1500 to
2700 years BP. Two of the unsatisfactory samples were
run in 1962 and are from the Eddleman site (41OR49).
Why they are unusable is hard to say except that both
sampling and radiocarbon laboratory considerations have
refined immensely over four decades; trying to rationalize these two results seems futile because it would
not be known if the rationalization was correct or only

a manipulation until many new age determinations had
been made. The only recourse here is to obtain and run
new samples on 41OR49—definitely a worthwhile undertaking.
Two other samples obtained just recently from a
test pit in earth midden deposits at the Black Hill Mound
(41JF24) were expected to date a large early ceramic
pottery assemblage.
But Black Hill also contained some older dart
points and evidently the Archaic midden deposit there
was more substantial than first thought. And so these
two very nearly identical radiocarbon samples are far
too old to illuminate early ceramic chronology and probably date a previously unrecognized Middle Archaic
deposit (Aten and Bollich 2004).
A single sample from Tchefuncte deposits at shell
site 16CU108 was dated to 2350 years BP (Aten and
Bollich 2002; Valastro et al. 1975), or comfortably within
our expected age range for early ceramic sites. An additional two samples obtained about ten years ago date
very late Archaic deposits (Taylor Bayou Period) at the
Gaulding site (Aten and Bollich 2002) and as expected
fall just older than the expected initial age range for
early ceramic sites. Finally, a single date is available
from late prehistoric shell deposits at 41JF11 on
Hillebrandt Bayou (Raab and Smith 1983) which falls
appropriately younger than the expected early ceramic
time range.
As a result, available radiocarbon determinations
confirm, or perhaps only hint at, the expectation that
early ceramics first appear in the Sabine sometime close
to 2500 to 2700 years BP and were certainly no longer
in use by 700 years ago. They give no more precise
indication of how long this distinctive ceramic assemblage continued in use. Further, they give no idea of
how the variation in ceramic classes and abundances,
as well as other artifacts, in the collections reported

local changes in early ceramic culture in the Sabine
Lake Area. To obtain an initial working concept of the
relative ages of the collections and to use this to begin
mapping changes in the early ceramic material culture,
we reverted to graphic seriation of ceramics (cf. Ford
1962).
CERAMIC SERIATION
Although now a generally outdated technique given

the ready (but expensive) availability of more precise
dating methods, in its day and when carefully used,
graphic seriation was an effective tool for relative dating. In southeast Texas it was used successfully in the
past both on Sabine Lake Area ceramic surface collections (Aten and Bollich 1969) and, in conjunction with
numerous radiocarbon dates, on excavated Galveston
Bay Area ceramics (Aten 1983). In the present study,
with little absolute dating available, graphic seriation
will be used to clarify presumed temporal relationships
among the mostly excavated collections examined here

Chapter 2: A Local Chronology for Sabine Lake Area Early Ceramic Sites

and to continue formulation of a Sabine local chronology. A description of applying graphic seriation is given
in the studies identified in the preceding three citations
and will not be repeated. After classification of sherds
from each site, if necessary, proveniences were combined to assure availability of at least 50 sherds for
each provenience unit to be included in the graphic seriation; this was possible in all cases but one.
As noted above, previous studies in the northern
Gulf coast provide guidance in ordering the relationship
of these Sabine collections. For example, it was known
that Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte should have
its largest representation early in the early ceramic and
gradually fade in usage through time. Tchefuncte Plain,
variety Mandeville was known to have its principal
period of use sometime after the peak of variety
Tchefuncte. Baytown Plain grog-tempered varieties, on
the other hand, should have small proportions early
and increase in usage with time. And dart points were
known to continue through Tchefuncte culture with arrow points appearing after that. These occurrences of
well-known time-diagnostic sherds and of projectile
points provide an independent check on the graphic
ordering of individual collections (cf., Aten 1983:Figure
14.1; Ford and Quimby 1945; Ford 1952:Figure 2).
The relative proportion of the ceramic types or
varieties in each collection unit was drawn on graph
paper. These graphs were then arranged into a sequence
that produced the smoothest possible pattern of increasing and decreasing abundance while not violating their
stratigraphic order or other constraints as described
above (Figure 4; Table 2). For more information on the
collections, refer to the individual site chapters that follow.
A further measure of validation of the Sabine early
ceramic sequence may be obtained by comparison with
the sequence to the west for the Galveston Bay Area
(Aten 1983:Figure 14.1). In the Sabine and Galveston
sequences, Tchefuncte Plain, variety Mandeville
reaches peak popularity when Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte and O’Neal Plain, variety Conway appear to have passed their peak. Although not unequivocal, Goose Creek Plain, variety Anahuac in both areas
may have peak popularity about the same time as
Tchefuncte Plain, variety Mandeville. And the majority of Tchefuncte-related decorated ware occurs in the
earliest ceramic period in both localities.
However, in the Sabine there are frequent occurrences of Marksville-related ceramics while no deco-

11

rated Marksville sherds have been reported from the
Galveston Bay Area (Aten 1983; L. Patterson, personal
communication, 1/9/2004). Another notable difference
occurs in the Baytown Plain grog-tempered wares.
Baytown Plain varieties are both present, albeit in small
proportions, from the beginning of ceramics in the
Sabine; however, they do not appear in Galveston Bay
sites until much later. Because of the preponderance of
Tchefuncte, O’Neal, and Baytown wares in the Sabine,
Goose Creek Plain, variety unspecified, is not as prominent in early ceramic sites there as it is in early Galveston
Bay Area sites. While the ceramic sequences in the two
areas are consistent up to a point, they also have distinctive features.
CHRONOLOGICAL PERIODS
Based on graphic seriation of 17 ceramic collections (Figure 4) it is possible to begin suggesting a local
chronology in the Sabine Lake Area, although the ages
of periods within the early ceramic remain vague (Figure 5). The initial ceramic time period—distinguished
by several features but notably by the continuing use of
dart points, absence of biface arrow points, and by a
relative abundance of Tchefuncte-related ceramics—is
named the Orange Period. This period is succeeded by
one named the Big Hill Period which is distinguished
by the decline and disappearance of dart points and the
introduction of biface arrow points, by a minor occurrence of Tchefuncte-related ceramics and by the appearance of ceramics related to Marksville culture. While
these assemblages seem to roughly correlate with Tchula
and Marksville periods in south central Louisiana, currently these are only approximate relations as mapped
by diagnostic ceramics and projectile point distributions
in the Sabine. Whether the overlapping distributions
Tchefuncte and Marksville ceramics in the Sabine (Figure 37; Table 42) are actually distinct from those of
Tchula/Marksville in Louisiana, or whether the Sabine
distributions are imprecise due to the nature of how the
collections were made is not known. For now, however, while Marksville-related sherds are a distinctive
marker for early ceramic assemblages, they cannot be
taken as exclusively signifying the Big Hill Period.
The Orange Period succeeds the Taylor Bayou
Period (Late Archaic) around 2700 BP and begins in
the Sabine Lake Area with the presence of ceramics
dominated by Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte. This
time period ends with Tchefuncte Plain, variety

variety Tchefuncte, but is accompanied by small proportions of several other varieties: Tchefuncte Plain,
variety Mandeville; Goose Creek Plain, variety
Anahuac; Goose Creek Plain, variety unspecified;
O’Neal Plain, variety Conway; and both Baytown Plain
varieties (San Jacinto and Phoenix Lake). While

Finally, and included here only because of the
contrast they present, are a couple of site units from

the sand-tempered O’Neal type, continued abundance
of Baytown Plain, variety San Jacinto and a substantial expansion of Baytown Plain, variety Phoenix Lake.

Goose Creek Plain, variety unspecified, may continue
but at a reduced abundance.
These newly named culture chronological periods for the Sabine Lake Area and their apparent relation to other areas east and west, are shown in Figure
5. Since this investigation attempts to focus more on
identifying periods of culture stability and culture change,
the definition of culture “phases” has been avoided at
this time. These tend to become too compartmentalized as organizing structures and there are problems
enough in this connection using chronological periods.

EXCAVATIONS AT THE EDDLEMAN SITE (41OR49)

INTRODUCTION
The Eddleman site (41OR49) is only a short distance south of the city of Orange, Texas, and just west
of the Texas-Louisiana state boundary on the Sabine
River floodplain (Figure 1). Originally identified as
“Sabine River Site No. 1” this naming scheme was never
continued over the following decades and in recent years
the site has been known simply after the name of the
excavator, C. D. Eddleman.
The site is perched on a rise surrounded entirely
by the Sabine River’s marshy floodplain. It is a dense
sheet deposit of shell midden composed mostly of the
brackish water clam Rangia cuneata along with small
quantities of freshwater mussels and the estuarine oyster, Crassostrea virginica, as well as other faunal and
artifactual material. It was found by C. D. Eddleman
and friends in 1953 while exploring along Adams Bayou,
and much of the following site and excavation description is based on notes provided by Dr. Eddleman.
After consulting about excavation methods with
Professor T. N. Campbell at The University of Texas
Anthropology Department, and receiving permission to
work at the site from Mr. Burch, the lessee, Eddleman
began excavating the site in 1958 and continued this
until 1961. A brief description of the site and findings
were included in a paper reporting the unusual recovery of a margay (Felis weidi) mandible from among
the thousands of faunal remains found during excavation (Eddleman and Akersten 1966).
In 1973 no trace of the site could be found and it
was reported as destroyed (McGuff and Roberson
1974:23). However, it subsequently developed that the
site’s location had been misplotted in state records and
the field surveyors had been diverted to the wrong location. The site was visited most recently in 2000 by
C. N. Bollich and appears to remain in approximately

the same condition as when the excavation was finished in 1961.
The investigation at this site a half century ago
was the earliest systematic archeological excavation in
the Sabine Lake Area and is of considerable interest
today because of the quality of the information: the site
surface was surveyed, horizontal grid and vertical depth
controls were maintained, excavated deposits were
screened, specimens were catalogued and inventories
were recorded, and relatively large collections of ceramics, lithics, faunal remains and other specimens were
recovered. The ceramics, in particular, are of interest
because they include numerous examples of obvious
Tchefuncte culture affinity and clearly constitute an early
ceramic assemblage. Even though a very early excavation, the maintenance of key controls makes this collection an important contribution to understanding early
ceramic cultures in the Sabine.
LANDSCAPE SETTING
The Eddleman site rests on a heavily wooded topographic rise, or hammock, entirely surrounded by
high level marsh (Figure 6) well out in a section of
floodplain apparently shaped by a large-radius stream
meander during the Deweyville phase of stream development (Figure 7). In the absence of data on sediments
underlying the archeological deposit it is difficult to know
what the origin of this landform is. The geometry of
the rise, with the steep or west side of the feature oriented toward the relic Deweyville channel position, suggests the hammock and the site might be on top of
Deweyville-Sabine River point bar deposits surrounded
by Holocene floodplain deposition (cf. Morton et al.
1996:322–324). Alternatively, the presence of a Quaternary Beaumont Formation inlier cannot be discounted
either.

Figure 6. Eddleman site (41OR49) in tree-covered hammock, left center distance.

The significance of the site’s geomorphology for
understanding the use of this location by Native Americans is that, for some considerable time after the onset
of Holocene fluvial conditions, the area where the
Deweyville channel had once been may have remained
ponded and a desirable source of fish and other aquatic
fauna. And, of course, the surrounding high marsh would
have contained a diverse, exploitable, terrestrial and terrestrial-aquatic fauna (White et al. 1987). The presence of a concentrated archeological deposit of Rangia
cuneata shells may or may not indicate brackish ponds
or streams near the site. Rangia cuneata larvae are
sometimes swept upstream by storm surges there to
settle and grow into substantial local populations in freshwater for their entire life span.
The nearest straight line distance from the
Eddleman site to the upland prairie is some 300 m to
the north (Figure 7). However, while the site does not
appear to bear any orientation relationship to the nearby
Adams Bayou it may be that that stream offered the
most practical access to and from both the prairie uplands, and to the river and points north or south. The
nearest distance from the site to Adams Bayou was
some 150 m to the southwest. From that place the original bayou channel (before modern channel straighten-

ing) wended its way northwestward a short distance
where it began impinging on the upland prairie, or southeastward for 3 km where it flowed into the Sabine River
at a point about 9.5 km above where the river flows
into Sabine Lake.
Today the Sabine Lake region is very wet—the
wettest location in Texas—receiving a not very seasonal annual average of 1.1 to 1.4 m of rainfall with
many years exceeding this amount (Bomar 1983). The
hammock where the archeological shell deposit exists
reaches a maximum height of about 6 feet (1.8 m) above
the marsh level. It is roughly elliptical in outline. Its
major and minor axes are about 205 feet (62.5 m) by
about 115 feet (35 m) (Figure 8). This elevated site
location, however, is usually dry and is densely covered with yaupon and chinaberry trees and with grasses
which, along with its accessibility to many subsistence
resources, made 41OR49 a desirable habitation location.
Interpretations of the environmental setting also
are contingent upon emerging research into sea level
fluctuations. Recent archeological and geological investigations (Aten and Bollich 2002:77–83; Morton et al.
1999) in the Sabine have indicated small scale rising
and falling sea level on the order of 1 to 1.5 m during

Chapter 3: Excavations at the Eddleman Site (41OR49)

the Middle and Late Holocene. Analysis of the Late
Holocene Gaulding site and other nearby locations suggests that early ceramic Tchefuncte-associated deposits may have dated to a time when sea level was somewhat lower than present thus potentially altering (i.e.,
dewatering) the landscape significantly at the time in
which the Eddleman site was in use. At later times there
are indications of sea level a meter or so higher than
present which could have encouraged sedimentation in
the marsh around the rise on which the site is perched.
These sea level findings are preliminary and while it
seems that they occurred, their timing and correlation
with archeological sites are tentative. In the absence of
further work at the Eddleman site, we merely identify
this possibility at the present and note that it should be
kept in mind.
EXCAVATION PROCEDURES

The archeological shell deposit, composed predominantly of Rangia cuneata clam shells, is generally
about 1 foot (30 cm) thick, more or less, and is draped
over most of the area of the hammock—at least that
above the 3-foot contour (Figure 9). Above the archeological shell deposit is a layer of humus ranging from 4
to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) thickness in places and extending over the entire surface of the mounded hammock.
The site’s topography was surveyed by transit,
tape, and stadia rod in relation to a local benchmark
established on the highest elevation; this survey, made
at the time of excavation, was the basis for Figure 8.
Taking the 3-foot contour as an approximation of the
minimum extent of the site, it measures some 150 feet
(45 m) long by 90 feet (27 m) wide. The minimum site
area, not accounting for irregularities in the roughly elliptical footprint of the 3-foot contour, is about 994

square yards (831 square meters), or a fifth of an acre.
An attempt was made to establish a grid of 4 foot
(1.2 m) squares, but since a condition of the permission to excavate was to not remove any trees, encounters with them periodically necessitated offsets in the
grid. A high school teacher at the time, Eddleman was
able to recruit assistance from students; occasionally,
however, the volunteer labor pool outstripped preparation of the site map also causing some grid units to be
not exactly aligned with others. These combined circumstances account for the grid units that depart from
the usual geometry of an excavation grid. It was observed early in the work that greater densities of artifacts were to be found at the higher elevations of the
hammock and this bias further guided the selection of
grid units to excavate.

Grid units were numbered sequentially in the order they were excavated (Figure 8). Four feet (1.2 m)
square, they were dug in arbitrary 6 inch (15 cm) levels
beginning at the ground surface and continuing until
sterile subsoil was reached. Debris from each level was
sifted through a half-inch mesh (12 mm) screen to recover archeological materials. All debris caught in the
screens was retained except Rangia cuneata clam shells.
Items from each excavation level were placed in bags
separately labeled for the grid and level number. After
washing, specimens were catalogued with India ink to
note the grid, level, and, in some instances, a serial
inventory number. Thus a specimen labeled “38-3-4”
is the fourth item listed in the inventory from level 3 of
the thirty-eighth excavation grid unit. The inventory
listed and briefly described all unusual artifacts from

22

each level; abundant artifacts such as plain potsherds
were not numbered beyond grid and level numbers.
Two radiocarbon dates (Table 1) were run by a
local oil company laboratory in the early 1960s on
Rangia cuneata clam shells (Eddleman and Akersten
1966); unfortunately these are not possible to interpret
or understand today and will not be used further in this
discussion. We have tried to calibrate the results using
present-day procedures but the results do not even
roughly align with well-established age expectations for
early ceramics in the northern Gulf coast. New samples
will be needed to clarify this problem and the absolute
age of the archeological deposit.
Finally, the margay specimen of biogeographic
interest (Eddleman and Akersten 1966) and most of
the other faunal remains are curated at the Vertebrate
Paleontology Laboratory; the remainder of the faunal
remains, as well as the plain pottery, has been curated
at TARL, both at The University of Texas at Austin.
Most records, photographs, site plans, and all other artifacts have remained in the possession of C. D.
Eddleman.
ARTIFACTS
The artifact collection from this site is of considerable interest today because of the large proportion of
ceramics related to the Tchefuncte culture of south
Louisiana. While it is not unusual to find Tchefuncte
ceramics, usually plainware, in southeast Texas, neither is it usual to find them in large quantities and in
such variety of decorated ware. The Eddleman site collection is the most emphatically Tchefuncte-associated
assemblage of pottery and associated tools and ornaments so far known from southeast Texas. Ceramics
from the Eddleman site seriate to the Orange Period
and are among the oldest, if not the oldest, from early
ceramic sites currently known in the Sabine (Table 2).
Ceramics
The single largest excavated collection of Orange
Period sherds—more than 3,000—currently available
for study in the Sabine is that from the Eddleman site,
41OR49. It also contains the most diverse collection of
rare forms many of which are probably Sabine Lake
Area local varieties of recognized decorated pottery associated with lower Mississippi valley Tchefuncte and
Marksville cultures (Table 3).

The procedure used for describing the Eddleman
site collection is similar to that used recently in Aten
and Bollich (2002). The primary differences are that
for the Eddleman and other sites reported here continued attention has not been given to detailed analysis
distinguishing the sedimentary characteristics of the ceramic pastes. Instead, because of a relative abundance
of rim and base sherds, in this study focus has been
applied to evidence of vessel forms as best they can be
inferred from sherds.
There are several distinctive features in the ceramics from this site. First, the proportionally large quantities of Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte and O’Neal
Plain, variety Conway, combined with very small proportions of Tchefuncte Plain, variety Mandeville and
Baytown varieties firmly place the age of this site early
in the earliest ceramic period, the Orange Period, according to the seriation presented in Chapter 2.
Second, as noted above, there is a surprising abundance of sherds from rare forms of decorated vessels.
While sherds known to be typical of decorated wares
from both southeast Texas and south Louisiana are
present, other examples are modifications of defined
types/varieties as well as some uniquely decorated ceramics that were previously unknown. Among the latter, the most striking is the technique of entirely perforating vessel walls just below the rim. This should not
be confused with the technique of indenting the wall to
create a node on the opposite, usually exterior, side.
Rim nodes are familiar on the Alexander series in south
Louisiana, but they are found on both sand-tempered
and sandy paste ware in the Sabine early ceramics.
For reasons of simplifying the subsequent narrative, as described in Chapter 1, the descriptions of these
types and varieties are given in Appendix A and their
frequency distributions at 41OR49 are found in Table
3. See Table 42 for identification of sherds that are
illustrated in Figures 42 through 47.
In addition to typological classification, rim and
base sherds in this and the other site collections were
separated out. Sherds from 41OR49 that are sufficiently
large to approximately orient them so that a rim or base
profile could be drawn were classified according to the
vessel forms shown in Figure 48 and their frequencies
are included in Table 4.
Lithics

larger population of artifacts, as mentioned in Chapter
1, to examine the whole early ceramic projectile point
sample, at what sites they were found, and for detailed
metric and attribute data, see the figures and tables in

Appendix B. Likewise, the biface reduction sequence
also was synthesized after all collections were described
and the relationships between various kinds of modified and unmodified pebbles, debitage, preforms, and
tools were inferred; see Figure 40.

Projectile points
A sizable collection of projectile points was recovered from 41OR49 (Table 5). All were dart points
save for a single arrow point found in the first (highest)
excavation level and that could have been discarded on
the surface of the site at any time later than the Orange
Period occupation of the site. While it is possible this
specimen could be an early example of arrow technology in the Sabine, that is an unanswerable question at
this time.
Other biface tools
Knife, stemmed (Figure 10, A). This is an elongate biface with a large U-shaped stem for hafting, an
unsharpened straight edge on one side of the blade, and
a convex opposite edge better prepared for cutting; see

Table 6 for metric attributes. The chert material used is
of good quality and larger than is usually the case with
lithic tools made from river gravels; possibly this tool
or its preform was imported or was reworked from
lithic material scavenged from Archaic or earlier sites
found in the Sabine.
Side-edged tools, hand-held (Figure 10, B–D).
These cutting or scraping tools possibly are failed attempts at making biface preforms. Two are made as
core tools from small stream pebbles and one is made
on a quartzite flake (see Table 6); all are approximately
the same size. The small size of the unworn part of the
tool suggests they were hand-held.
Edged convenience tools (Figure 10, E). These
are elongate chert pieces with use wear on one of the
small ends (see Table 6). Both artifacts are made on
flakes from river pebbles. Portions of the presumed
distal end of these elongate pieces of chert are roughly

chipped to facilitate using that end for cutting; there is
no wear suggestive of uses as end scrapers. The proximal end has been little worked and remains rough although almost no cortex remains; possibly these pieces
were preforms or failed preforms and the distal ends
were slightly used for cutting. One specimen (40-3-2)
may have been heat-treated as suggested by the red
color and slightly lustrous flake scars. Given the minor
degree of shaping and preparation of a working edge,
these two specimens are described as “convenience”
tools in which a handy piece of chert was given a few
blows to form a small cutting edge for brief use and
which were likely then discarded rather than curated.
Drill/perforators. These are a very common lithic
tool in the early ceramic tool kits and have a varying bit

diameter (presumably reflecting their intended purpose),
varying bit length (reflecting the extent of use attrition),
and expanded proximal end in many cases to facilitate
hand held use, while in some other cases reflecting use
by hafting. There often is wear on the bit but rotational
wear striations at or near the distal tip of the bit are
only occasionally found. For this reason it is surmised
that these tools are sometimes drills and other times
perforators. However, Jon Gibson recently reported that
these tools with long bits that show little or no rotary
striations and are thereby thought to be used for other
purposes such as perforating, may be misleading; such
tools when “…used as drills do not develop obvious
signs of rotary abrasion until they are completely worn
out” (Gibson 2001:135). This observation appears to

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

be consistent with the Eddleman site specimens, but
since there is no particular formal distinction between
the obvious drill tools and the possible perforators they
are all identified here as “drill/perforators” and their
different forms are described below.
Drill/perforators, stemmed (Figure 10, F–L). Seven
beaked tools, most with significant smoothing on their
distal tip including one with rotary striations, were found
that had crude stems (see Table 6); presumably these
tools were either used hafted or were reclaimed from
use as projectile points when resharpening had become
too advanced. Indeed the metrics and appearance of
these artifacts resemble in a general way the Kent dart
points reported in Appendix B (Figures 50 and 51, and
Table 48); or they could have been made originally to
serve as hafted drill/perforators.
Drill/perforators, hand-held (Figure 10, M–P). Several other tools resemble the stemmed form in all respects except that rather than have stems for hafting,
they have enlarged or bulbous proximal ends that presumably were used while held by hand (see Table 6).
Otherwise there is no significant difference.
Drill/perforators, bi-pointed (Figure 10, W). This
“boomerang”-shaped tool may be an intentional form,
or may be a poorly crafted version of another kind of
drill/perforator (see Table 6). It may have been intended
for use on either end, and thus the description as a bipointed form.
Drill/perforators, small elongate (Figure 10, Q–
T). These tools share the same design features as other
drill/perforators but are much smaller; indeed they bring
to mind the microflints so common at Poverty Point
sites (see Table 6). They are made on small flakes and
have a bulbous or flat but wide proximal end to facilitate grasping by hand, and a long narrow bit. The bits
apparently broke from time to time and use wear ranges
from heavy rotational striations and smoothing to no
obvious wear under 10× or 20× magnification.
End scrapers, hand-held (Figure 10, U–V). These
distinctive tools are elongate river pebbles bifacially
chipped to a flat, horizontal scraping edge on the distal
end with only slight modification of the proximal end
which remains bulbous and covered with cortex (see
Table 6). Apparently these pebbles were too short to
continue resharpening. Use wear is particularly developed on the distal end of specimen 52-3-2 (see Figure
10, V and Table 6).
Biface tools broken in use

Drill/perforator bits. Two broken distal tips of drill/
perforators were found, one made of chert and the other
of silicified wood, possibly heat-treated, and both showing slight wear (see Table 5).
Projectile point stems. Three chert pieces have
the shape of stems from projectile points or a similar
hafted tool (see Table 5). Two are more or less straight
sided while the third is a strongly expanding stem. One
may have been heat treated.
Projectile point distal blade tips. Two pointed chert
distal tip fragments were found (see Table 5).
Biface tool failures in manufacture
Projectile point failures (Figure 10, X–Y). Eight
bifaces apparently were intended to be projectile points
but broke or were otherwise given up at various stages
of development (see Table 5). Seven of the incomplete
artifacts were chert and one of silicified wood. One
specimen appears to have been heat-treated as suggested by color and lustrous flake scars. No measurements were made since their intended final form is not
known and most were broken.
Unidentified biface tool failures. These are six
unidentifiable chert fragments that had been bifacially
chipped until given up. Two fragments appear to have
been heat-treated (see Table 5).
Uniface tools
Used flakes (see Table 5). Twenty-three flakes
were recovered that had unifacial nibbling around part
of their periphery but appear not to have been shaped
into any particular form. One additional cortex flake
was unifacially chipped and apparently shaped to a limited extent. Presumably these flakes were debris from
tool-making or resharpening. As convenience tools, or
temporary cutting tools—that is flakes that probably
were found, used without modification, and discarded
all at the same location—were all made of chert except
for one quartzite flake.
Hammerstones
Lightweight hammerstone (Figure 11, H–H’).
Specimen 51-3 is a chert stream pebble that has been
trimmed on two ends to achieve the desired weight and
utility as a hammerstone (see Table 5). The tool is 32.3
mm long, 26.2 mm wide, 17.4 mm thick, and its weight

is 18.3 gms; the cortex color is dark grayish brown
(10YR4/2) and the unweathered chert interior is a light
gray (2.5Y7/2).
Medium-weight hammerstone (Figure 12, A–A’).
Specimen 41-1-1 appears to be a quartzite stream pebble
fashioned into a hammerstone (see Table 5). The original pebble was tabular in form and 22.4 mm thick.
Cortex remains on these two parallel surfaces. Laterally, the pebble has been carefully trimmed and ground
into a pentagonal form. The principal hammerstone surface is at the intersection between two of the straight
edges of the pentagon. This tool is 33.7 mm in maximum length, 30.4 mm in minimum length, 22.4 mm
thick, and weighs 30.7 gms. Cortex color is brown
(10YR4/3); no clean, fresh broken surfaces of the
quartzite were present, so interior color, a light gray
(2.5Y7/2), and lithology are only estimated.
Heavyweight hammerstone (Figure 12, B–B’).
Specimen 12-3-1 is a quartzite stream pebble used as a
heavier weight hammerstone apparently without any
modification of its original form (see Table 5). Roughly
rectangular in profile, it has battering along both of its
short ends. The tool is 59.7 mm long, 44.9 mm wide,
31.0 mm thick, and its weight is 110.4 gms, roughly
four to five times heavier than the two hammerstones
described above. No cortex was developed, but the piece
is heavily stream-rolled and weathered. Unmodified
exterior surface color is light brownish gray (10YR6/
2); the estimated interior color, from the battered surface, is light gray (2.5Y7/1).
Debris from prior manufacturing stages
Unmodified pebbles, adequate size. A single, unmodified pebble of silicified wood was recovered that
was 23.4 mm wide, 55.5 mm long, and 13.5 mm thick.
While this pebble was large enough to be fashioned
into a bifacial tool, its condition as a weathered piece of
silicified wood may have caused it to be discarded as
unsuitable (see Table 5).
Unmodified pebbles, too small. One of the reasons it seems likely that a principal source of river
pebbles used for lithic tools is from alligator gastroliths
(Aten 1983:Appendix B) is because unmodified pebbles
of adequate size for tool-making are relatively rare in
Sabine sites, while alligator bones are relatively common, as well as lithic pebbles that are too small for
tool-making are relatively common. If gastroliths were
not used for lithic tools, more pebbles of larger sizes

would be found in the sites. Eighteen small pebbles, all
chert except for one of silicified wood, were recovered
in the Eddleman excavations (see Table 5) the majority
of which were 20 mm or less in maximum dimension.
They are well-rounded and often highly polished.
Pebble inspection flakes and fragments. Thirteen
fragments (Table 5) appear to be broken from a protruding end of potential resource pebbles allowing examination of the interior of the pebbles and their suitability for tool-making. Twelve of the fragments are
chert and one is quartzite; most are primary cortex fragments. All of the flakes except one are smaller than 25
mm in maximum dimension.
Inspected resource pebbles. Two relatively larger
pebbles with inspection flakes removed (Table 5) may
be either rejects or were suitable for tool-making but
never used.
Pebble and bipolar cores. Five chert pebbles appear to be used as cores from which small flakes were
being removed (Table 5). Since the flake removal was
not an attempt to shape the cores it is assumed they
were not being fashioned into tools.
Biface preform failures. Twelve partially modified pebbles were found (Table 5) that appear to be
failed attempts at roughing out preforms in anticipation
of making tools of various sorts. Most of the modified
pebbles ranged from above 30 mm to more than 50
mm in maximum dimension. All were cherts except for
a single silicified wood pebble; one of the chert pebbles
appears to have been heat-treated. While one or two
may originally have been flakes, most of these artifacts
were attempted core tools, or attempts at removing cortex from pebbles and bifacially shaping them to be preforms.
Biface preforms. Two chert preforms were recovered (Table 5) one more or less circular in outline,
and the other elongate. Both were in excess of 40 mm
in maximum dimension.
Debitage
Lithic flakes. There were 258 flakes of various
kinds recovered from the excavation; these are enumerated in Tables 5 and 7. Nearly 95 percent of the
flakes were chert, with the remainder mostly silicified
wood and a very small amount of quartzite. Primary
cortex flakes were rare—about 4 percent; over 60 percent were secondary cortex flakes and nearly 35 percent were interior thinning flakes of various types. This

tool industry. Finally, over 83 percent of the flakes were
smaller than 25 mm in maximum dimension verifying
the focus of this industry on small pebbles and tools.
Bone artifacts

6 and 53-2-2 are pieces of antlers that appear to have
been used as a rigid surface against which cutting was
done. There were many antler fragments recovered
from the excavation most of which show abundant evidence of rodent gnawing. However, the present two
specimens have V-shaped cuts suggesting they resulted
from a cutting tool (see Table 5).

Socketed points
Pins, gaming piece, ornamental piece
Socketed points (long form) (Figure 13, F). Specimen 50-3-14 was fashioned from a deer metapodial
(see Table 5). This artifact is nearly complete lacking
only a small piece of the distal tip and a small section of
the proximal end or basal socket. The estimated original length of the point is approximately 130 mm.
Awls
Splinter awl, hafted (?) (Figure 13, E). Specimen
4-1-1 is made from a splinter of the long bone of a
large mammal (see Table 5). The distal end was abraded
into a point. The distal tip, while it shows no wear
striations, has been worn into a nubbin suggesting this
awl was used for weaving or basketry. Although the
proximal end is unfinished, there is wear and rounding
of the rough edges indicating the tool is complete and
was never more finished than is seen here. Despite this
evidence it cannot be determined if the tool was hafted
for use or hand held.
Convenience tools
Anvil, antler (Figure 13, G–H). Specimens 38-2-

Incised fragment, cylindrical (Figure 13, B–B’).
Specimen 50-3-6 is probably the proximal end of a longer
artifact, possibly a pin, made from a long, narrow splinter
of mammal bone. About two-thirds of the circumference of this splinter is ornamented with a common triangular geometric design engraved into the bone (see
Table 5). This remnant piece is only 32.1 mm long and
6.8 mm in diameter.
Flat pin, undecorated (Figure 13, C). Specimen
56-2-1 is the proximal end of what appears to have
been a bone pin (see Table 5). It is made from a nearly
flat splinter of mammal bone. The remnant piece is
54.8 mm long; the flared proximal end is 15.1 mm wide,
while the remnant shaft is 7.0 mm wide.
Incised gaming piece (Figure 13, A). Specimen
15-2-1 has been misplaced and was not examined directly. However, there is an excellent photograph made
by C. D. Eddleman in which the piece’s catalog number shows clearly (see Table 5). This specimen is a
diagonally incised piece of relatively flat mammal bone.
Both ends appear to have been finished and the edges
are worn from handling or use. It may be another example of gaming pieces that have been found from time

37). Measured from the photograph, this piece is 29.1
mm long and 15.0 mm wide.
Tubular bead, fragment (Figure 13, D–D’). Specimen 22-2-1 is one end of a tubular bead ornament apparently made from an antler (see Table 5). It has been

drilled lengthwise with a hole 3.9 mm in diameter.
Unidentifiable fragments
Cut tool-making debris. Five pieces of cut bone
debris were excavated (see Table 5). These are not

functional but are residues from manufacture of tools
or ornaments and include hollow bird long bones, antler tines, and mammal long bones.
Distal tips, unidentified tools. The excavated collection also includes 10 examples of finished distal tips
broken from the shaft of whatever they had been a part
(see Table 5). Several resemble the tips of socketed
bone points, at least one was the tip of a slender bone
pin or awl, and the function of the others cannot be
estimated from the piece remaining.
Shaft fragments, unidentified tools. In addition,
10 shaft fragments were excavated that had broken from
various kinds of bone tools, probably awls, pins and
socketed points (see Table 5).
Shell artifacts
Tools
Scoops, mussel shell (Figure 11, B–C). As noted
elsewhere, there are several freshwater mussel shell fragments in the excavated collection; unfortunately the
majority of these fragments defy easy interpretation of
their form and function. The most convincing are three
examples of scoops each fashioned from a section of
shellfish valve including part of the umbo. These are
reminiscent of the bone scoop or spatula from 41CH36
(Aten 1983:263) and may be similar in concept.
Specimen 13-3 is 76.1 mm long and 40.0 mm in
maximum width. Specimen 38-3 is 42.4 mm long and
23.4 mm wide. Specimen 40-3-6 is 62.5 mm long and
45.1 mm wide (see Table 5).
Ornamental objects
Pendant, Busycon sp. whorl (Figure 11, A). Specimen 56-3-2 is a tear-drop in outline and made from the
outer whorl of Busycon sp (see Table 5). The pendant
is thin and lightweight; 48.5 mm long, 38.6 mm wide,
3.5 mm thick, and weighs 7.2 gms. The suspension
hole at the narrow end is 3.7 mm in diameter and was
drilled from the interior.
Columella pendants and cut section (Figure 11,
D–E). Specimen 7-1-3 is a section 38.1 mm long and
19.9 mm in diameter cut from a robust conch shell (see
Table 5). Both ends are drilled from two directions so
as to create holes at the ends that, rather than perforate
the entire length for stringing like a bead, are instead
drilled from the side to create a channel for securing

the piece at each end. Specimen 42-2-1 (Figure 11, E)
is a section 42.5 mm long and 10.9 mm in diameter cut
from a relatively small conch. No drilling has been attempted on this narrow diameter piece but it appears
otherwise to be similar to specimen 7-1-3.
Estuarine/marine shells
Columella, Busycon, unmodified; Outer whorl,
Busycon, fragments; Dinocardium sp. fragments; Unidentified fragments, probably Dinocardium. Several
shell fragments were excavated that presumably were
collected from the Gulf beaches: Dinocardium sp. (three
fragments, unmodified); Busycon sp. (one shoulder and
part of the outer whorl, unmodified); and two pieces of
a heavily eroded marine shell, possibly a Dinocardium,
unmodified. Many collections from sites in the coastal
zone contain a few specimens like these and they are
assumed to have been collected on visits to the Gulf
beach for occasional use as shell tools, ornaments, and
perhaps for medicine bundles.

Other utilitarian artifacts
Pitted stones (Figure 12, C–C’). Specimen 38-33 is a bi-pitted stone fashioned from what appears to be
a tabular cobble of bog iron (see Table 5). It is very
hard and smooth and not earthy. It has a reddish brown
streak; exterior color is brown (7.5YR4/2 to 5/4). This
implement is 80.1 mm long, 59.4 mm wide, 31.4 mm
thick and weighs 206.8 gms. There are numerous striations on both pitted surfaces but these did not indicate
systematic patterns of use, i.e., rotary or back and forth.
Specimen 43-3-1 also is pitted on both sides and
is similar in cross-section to specimen 38-3-3 (as illustrated in Figure 12) but it is made from very fine-grained
limonitic sandstone. It is poorly cemented; limonite
comes off when rubbed with a finger although sand
grains tend to stay in place. It has a yellow streak and
the exterior color is yellow (10YR7/6). The tool is 95.2
mm long, 75.9 mm wide, 30.5 mm thick, and its weight
is 321.9 gms. No use striations are preserved on this
material.
Pitted stones are found widely throughout eastern Texas but their function remains an object of speculation. Suggestions have included use as an anvil for
cracking nuts or when working bipolar cores, as a small
metate for grinding such things as parched seeds, as

Chapter 3: Excavations at the Eddleman Site (41OR49)

pigment stones, or perhaps as held in the hand to apply
weight and pressure to the proximal end of a bow drill.
While these two pitted stones are superficially
identical it is not necessarily the case that they served
the same function. Specimen 43-3-1 was too friable to
serve any of the heavy-duty purposes often mentioned
for pitted stones such as an anvil for bipolar lithic tool
manufacture or for cracking nuts. Likewise it would
not be successful for much use as a small hand-metate
as are occasionally found in southeast Texas (cf. Aten
1983:266). The most plausible use seems to be as a
source of yellow pigment.
Specimen 38-3-3, on the other hand, appears to
be made of bog iron, although there are no chips out of
its surface exposing the interior composition to confirm
this identification. In any event, it is made of a much
more durable material than the other pitted stone from
this site. The surfaces of the concave pits, although
they do have random striations, are relatively smooth
and do not show any evidence such as multiple pitting
or an otherwise roughened surface from serving as an
anvil for bipolar tool manufacture or for any other hard
materials. Perhaps this pitted stone was used as well as
a source of pigment, in this case of a reddish brown
color.
Sandstone, unmodified. There are four small
pieces of fine, medium, and coarse-grained sandstone
ranging in maximum length from 30 to 50 mm (see
Table 5). They are all largely clear quartz sand with
some chert and heavy minerals cemented by a soft,
white, unidentified but non-calcareous cryptocrystalline mineral. They conceivably could all have been collected from the same sandstone source in the interior,
probably originally from the Catahoula Formation. Although they are cemented well enough to use as abrading tools, they would not survive long as stream pebbles,
and so were probably collected at the outcrop. Presumably they were used or were intended for use as
abrading tools for smoothing and shaping bone, shell,
and perhaps wood artifacts, although they presently have
no obvious intentional shape. There are no grooves or
facets preserved to specifically indicate their use, but
they are totally foreign objects to the lower Sabine River
area and must have been imported for a specific purpose or purposes.
Sandstone, biface. This is a narrow, elongated
piece of fine- to medium-grained, white sandstone (483-3) that has been roughly chipped bifacially (see Table
5). Presumably it served as an abrader or more specifi-

37

cally as what sometimes has been called a sandstone
saw but there are no obvious signs of use wear. The
surface of this artifact now is weathered and soft permitting erosion of the blade if not handled carefully. Its
current dimensions are 48.8 mm long, 30.5 mm wide,
and 12.8 mm thick.
Pigment stones (Figure 11, G). The excavation
recovered two pieces of dusky red (2.5YR3/3), earthy,
extremely fine-textured, ocherous rocks (see Table 5).
Both are large in area relative to their thin tabular form
suggesting they formed interbedded with other sediments; given their large size we presume these pieces
came from some distance in the interior of east Texas
or western Louisiana. One specimen has a large notch
cut in one side presumably to make red ochre powder
for red paint or wash for various purposes such as body
paint or as red coating on pottery or certain incised
artifacts. Specimen 2-4-3 is 55.4 mm long, 46.2 mm
wide, and 9.9 mm thick; specimen 7-3-2 is 63.5 mm
long, 49.5 mm wide, and 18.8 mm thick. Also see the
discussion above of “pitted stones” as possible other
sources of pigment of different colors.
Pumice, unmodified. Three fragments, probably
all from the same original small piece of pumice, were
found (Table 5). There were no grooves or facets on
any of the fragments to indicate use as an abrading
tool, although this was probably its intended purpose.
Pumice was typically collected along the Gulf beaches.
Also see the discussion above of “sandstone” for possible alternative abrading tools.
Asphalt. This collection contains a small (roughly
10-by-20 mm) globule of asphalt, a substance commonly collected on the Gulf beaches but potentially
found at oil seeps on land. Provenience is not available
for this specimen (Table 5).
Other non-utilitarian artifacts
Quartz crystal pendant (Figure 11, F–F’). This is
a clear, colorless quartz crystal (specimen 45-2-1) altered by percussion into an oval shape 29.1 mm long,
16.1 mm wide, and 11.0 mm thick (see Table 5). At the
top is a notch that has been ground into the crystal to
facilitate tying it to a string for suspension. Although
there are numerous abrasion surfaces, most are on edges
between intersecting flake scars and appear to postdate
the flaking. This pendant does not appear to have been
chipped from a stream pebble. It probably came from a
quarry in southeastern Oklahoma or the Llano uplift or

38

some geologically similar location.
Late historic debris
The collection also includes several items reflecting transitory hunting and picnic visits to the hammock
during very recent times (Table 5). These include a 32
caliber shell casing, a small fragment of ceramic
whiteware (both from the uppermost excavation level),
two clear glass buttons, an amber glass bead, and an
irregularly shaped polished agate stone (provenience not
recorded for the latter four items).
SUBSISTENCE FAUNA
A total of 19,003 vertebrate animal bones were
recovered and were examined by Eddleman and his
colleague W. A. Akersten. Of these, 8,856 bones were
identified to some taxonomic level (Table 8). In addition, these taxonomic identifications are also presented
according to their animal class (Table 9), an approach
described in Aten and Bollich (2002:67–69) to partition
the archeological sample into categories describing general body size and life style, such as “small-terrestrial,”
which perhaps translates the data of systematic taxonomy to more of a cultural statement.
There are remarkably minor differences in vertebrate bone recovery over any of the three principal
excavation levels at the Eddleman site (Figure 14). In
general, the greatest quantity of bones—nearly 60 percent—is from turtles followed at a distance by the whitetailed deer, muskrat, and birds. Beyond these are numerous other species present in very small quantities.
Bones of fish, large terrestrial aquatic animals (alligators), small terrestrials, and arboreal animals are consistently rare in all excavation levels. Small terrestrial
aquatics (including turtles), large terrestrials (in this case,
deer), and birds comprise the majority of the bones of
animals exploited for subsistence purposes at this site.
However, rather than simply speak in terms of
percentages of identified elements and the uncertainty
introduced by big versus little animals, animals with
greater or fewer skeletal elements, exploiting fauna at
different seasons, or even differences in butchering technique yielding fewer elements of larger animals and more
numerous elements of smaller animals, it may be feasible instead to speak in terms of changes in the encounter rate. The ratio of the total skeletal elements in
each animal class (Figure 14) reflects the pattern of

faunal subsistence at a given time at the site, and a
change in this ratio may signal a change in the pattern
of encountering animals for subsistence purposes.
And so, looking over the ratio of number of identified specimens for each animal class (Figure 14), there
is a hint, that by the time of the terminal occupation of
the Eddleman site, the subsistence use of small terrestrial aquatics and birds may have been increasing at the
expense of large terrestrials, but the quantitative differences are very small. The possible context of this incipient change may be the onset of sea level rise from
the Sanibel I low to the Wulfert high (Aten and Bollich
2002:81) causing the environment of the Eddleman site
to become progressively wetter.
Finally, in addition to the vertebrates, of course,
faunal subsistence at this site included substantial use
of the brackish-water clam Rangia cuneata and, rarely,
freshwater mussels and the estuarine oyster Crassostrea
virginica. No bulk samples of these were retained from
the excavation and so observations on their exploitation
cannot be made.
HUMAN REMAINS
One human burial and several other scattered human skeletal elements were discovered during the excavation. The interment was found in the second excavation level of grid unit 53 (Figure 8). Based on a field
photo taken by Dr. Eddleman, the body had been placed
on its right side with the right leg and arm tightly flexed
and the left extremities slightly more relaxed; information on the skeleton’s compass orientation are not available. According to the preliminary evaluation of this
skeleton by the human osteology staff at TARL in Austin (TARL Archives), the individual was a 40+ year old
male; the age estimate was based on dental attrition
and sex was based on the shape of the cranium and
sciatic notch. Pathologies were minor and consistent
with the individual’s advanced age: lower right second
and third molars were lost in life and tooth wear ranged
from moderate to extreme; also noted were compression and lipping of the cervical vertebra.
In addition to the interment, excavation elsewhere
in the site also produced the following teeth and bone: a
metacarpal and premolar from Grid 47-1; two teeth—a
molar and premolar from grid unit 40-2; and four deciduous teeth—three molars and an incisor—from grid
unit 32-3 (see Figure 8). The two teeth from level 2 of
grid unit 40 are from the same level and adjacent grid

unit to the interred skeleton found in grid unit 53. Their
condition and extreme occlusal wear is consistent with
that described for the burial and are assumed to be
from the same individual.
The four deciduous teeth from level 3 of grid unit
32 all share the same degree of preservation, similar
development, and slight occlusal wear characteristics
and are probably from a single juvenile. The single premolar from level one of grid unit 47 is a permanent
premolar with the crown heavily worn but without exposing the dentine, and probably represents an additional individual perhaps in their late 20s or early 30s.
Occlusal wear depends so much on diet and other behavioral activities that it is hard to be definitive in sug-

gesting the age of these individuals, but it seems certain
that they represent three separate individuals, one a
sub-adult, one a middle-aged adult, and the third a male
of advanced age. It is important to note also that only
the latter one of these individuals was represented by a
skeleton.
A recent review of the meager available information on Sabine Lake Area mortuary practices is included
in Aten and Bollich (2002:74) and will not be repeated
here since it does not really illuminate the 41OR49 situation. The skeletal interment from the Eddleman site
may well postdate the age of the midden accumulation.
Generally burials were not interred concurrent with habitation at the same location: at least that seems to be the

case in the Galveston Bay Area where there is better
information available on mortuary practices (Aten et al.
1976). The isolated teeth and metacarpal also are interesting. The possibilities here for their origin are disturbance of pre-existing interments by digging subsequent
grave pits in the midden deposit, cremation, or abandonment of a body on the ground surface.
The first two causes seem unlikely because in

both instances there would almost certainly have been
more human bones found given the density of the excavation grid squares. Digging multiple grave pits just
means more bones are likely to be found, and in prehistoric cremations fire rarely consumes all of the bones.
Abandonment of a body on the ground surface is another matter entirely. Over a period of time, bones become scattered over quite a large area and a few, as

found at this site, can easily remain on the surface to be
charred, weathered, or otherwise damaged during subsequent habitation use of the site. There are instances
of stray human bones incorporated in early ceramic
deposits in the Galveston Bay Area but, so far at least,
such have not been found at later sites (Aten et al.
1976:77–78). Whether the situation is similar in the
Sabine Lake Area is not yet known. In any event, the
isolated skeletal elements at 41OR49 may be contemporaneous with the habitation use of the site, or they
may postdate the site as probably did the relatively undisturbed flexed interment. The burial is now curated
at TARL as human osteology accession number 3198.

CONCLUSIONS
Several observations about the Eddleman site stand
out for notice. First, as sites in the area go, this is a
moderate-sized one measuring somewhere on the order of a fifth of an acre (8 percent of a hectare) if the 3
foot contour is taken as the site limit. Second, if the
number of sherds of each pottery type is plotted on a
site map as a proxy for locating the dense areas of
occupation, far and away the greatest quantity and density of artifacts is on the crest of the rise on which the
site rests. Third, the site contained a great variety of
ceramics, projectile points, and other lithic, bone, shell

42

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

and miscellaneous items. Among the lithics are not only
a variety of tools, but many different examples of raw
materials and residues from the lithic manufacturing
process (Table 5) such that, in conjunction with similar
debris from the other early ceramic sites to be described
shortly, an attempt is made at piecing together the lithic
tool-making process as used in early ceramic sites in
the Sabine; see Chapter 7.
The relatively large area of the shell deposit, and
the diversity of artifactual materials from this site suggest that the Eddleman site was a base camp occupied
more intensively than many other sites in the area. Situated as it is in a prolific, resource-rich environment (Table
9) on a major floodplain and near major streams, there
was ready access leading to the coast, to the coastal

prairies, and to the interior coastal plain. The presence
of asphalt, pumice, and marine and estuarine shells indicate Sabine Lake and the Gulf shore were periodically visited. The diversity of ceramics probably is a
reflection of lateral access along the coast via the coastal
prairies. Trade or expeditions into the interior coastal
plain is probably reflected by such things as sandstone
and pigment stones. Lithic tool production at the
Eddleman site was geared to relatively few kinds of
tools: primarily these were dart points, which may have
doubled as knives, and a number of drilling or perforating tools of slightly varying designs presumably used
for the fabrication of garments, storage containers, shelter, and such.

Chapter 4

ARCHEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE OF PIMPLE
(PRAIRIE) MOUND SITES 41JF26, 41JF31A, AND 41JF31B
AT PIPKIN RANCH
INTRODUCTION
The sites to be discussed in this chapter are located about 4 km south of Big Hill salt dome and 11
km inland from the Gulf of Mexico in southern Jefferson
County, Texas (Figure 1). This area includes the geological contact between the Quaternary Beaumont Formation to the north, and transgressing Holocene marsh
deposits to the south (Aronow 1971). Expressed in terms
of the region’s physical geography (see Chapter 1: Landscape setting), this is the contact between the coastal
prairies to the north, and the coastal marshes to the
south. The sites to be discussed are archeological habitation deposits that subsequently became stratified within
pimple mounds. Also known as prairie or mima mounds,
these particular geomorphic features were found near
the terminus of a relict distributary channel of the Pleistocene Trinity River. On air photos this fossil river channel is quite distinct and the adjacent natural levees are
dotted with innumerable such mounds (Figure 15).
The earth science literature abounds with discussions about the origin of pimple mounds, which occur
in several regions of North America west of the Mississippi River. On the Gulf coastal plain they are associated almost exclusively with the Beaumont/Prairie Formation and must number at least in the tens of thousands. In the late 20th century the prevailing technical
opinion is that they are entirely natural phenomena—
probably either erosional or eolian—and not younger
than Middle Holocene (Bernard and LeBlanc 1965;
Saucier 1994:162–165). Thus, in 1965, it was with considerable surprise that C. N. Bollich, while exploring
the area with Dessamae Lorrain seeking a location for
the 1965 Texas Archeological Society field school, discovered prehistoric pottery and other artifacts, included
in the scattered debris from a damaged pimple mound

near Big Hill. The upper nearly 18 inches of the mound
had been removed for use as a source of silty sand to
reinforce levees of nearby drainage ditches.
The pottery collected in 1965 and 1967 from the
damaged mound included both Tchefuncte and Goose
Creek sherds. Bollich was interested in determining
which of these pottery types preceded the other in the
prehistoric technology of the Sabine, a problem that
still remains unsolved. In 1968 he excavated a small
test pit in the in situ lower portion of the first mound—
entered in the Texas site registry as 41JF31A—and recovered more Tchefuncte-related ceramics.
Uncertain whether the archeological materials in
41JF31A were merely a random coincidence, in 1967
Bollich also excavated a small, controlled test in the
peripheral remnant of another damaged mound—a site
to be registered as 41JF26. This very small and brief
examination also produced artifacts stratified within the
structure of the mound, albeit of a somewhat younger
age. Given these indications that pimple mounds at this
location often contained archeological materials, a small
field crew spent the weekend of August 8-9, 1970, excavating a two square meter stratigraphic test in a third
mound—41JF31B. This pimple mound was substantially undisturbed and this excavation also produced
considerable archeological materials stratified at depth.
The implications of this latter work at 41JF31B
for further clarifying the nature and origin of pimple
mounds was published two decades ago (Aten and
Bollich 1981). That investigation reached the following
conclusions:
· Pimple mounds at the Pipkin Ranch locality were
aggradational features formed from redeposition of
sands and silts eroded from the Beaumont Formation exposed in the intermound areas;
· The different artifact assemblages in the three sites

Figure 15. Geomorphic setting of the Pipkin Ranch sites traced from U.S. Department of Agriculture aerial photograph BRA-4-68 flown on November
8, 1938. Small round and dashed round outlines are traces of pimple mounds; mounds are photographically less defined on the Pleistocene Beaumont
surface, not less abundant as shown here. See Figure 1 for position of this locality.

Chapter 4: Archeological Reconnaissance of Pimple (Prairie) Mound Sites

suggested that the mounds could require as much
as 300 to 500 years to accumulate leaving ample
time for early Native American peoples to use the
surface of these mounds as a dry refuge when they
were in the area;
· If most of the mound at 41JF31B accumulated during
a 300-500 year period ending some 1600 years ago
(based on the latest age of artifacts found there),
the truncated cone morphology of the mound would
probably be an equilibrium landform;
· Apparent erosional nick points near the base of the
undisturbed mound suggest that storm surges may
inhibit lateral spreading of the mounds;
· The age of artifacts in the youngest of the three
sites examined (41JF26) suggests the mound formation process continued until at least 700 years
ago and may be continuing at present.
The archeological evidence from these brief investigations is presented here because all three mounds
produced early ceramic artifacts. Since the 1960s, a
number of other pimple mounds in Louisiana and Texas
have been found with incorporated archeological deposits among which is the Baird’s Bayou site, 41OR34,
included here in Chapter 6.
LANDSCAPE SETTING
As can readily be seen from the Beaumont-Port
Arthur sheet of the Texas coastal zone Environmental
Geologic Atlas (Fisher et al. 1973), the surface geology
and geomorphology of Jefferson County is dominated
by the Pleistocene delta of the Trinity River. Flowing
down from the northwest the various once-upon-a-time
main channels of the Trinity diverge into a host of distributaries most of which terminate within a few km
landward of the present coastline. It is at the seaward
end of one of these relict distributaries, now south of
Big Hill salt dome, which is the location of the Pipkin
Ranch pimple mounds discussed here.
The natural levee deposits associated with these
Pleistocene channels are—or were before the upland
prairies were extensively graded for agricultural purposes—covered with thousands of pimple mounds. As
can be seen on Figure 15, the mounds containing the
archeological deposits reported here were found at the
contact between the Pleistocene distributary levees, and
the Holocene marsh. It can be seen, further, that numerous mounds are inundated to varying degrees by
the marsh. The marsh surrounding the distributary for-

45

mation—known as Spindletop Marsh—today is a mix
of freshwater high marsh and brackish low marsh (White
et al. 1987). But this area has been extensively modified to control drainage, minimize flooding by storm
surges, and to improve access, not to mention being
cut through by the Intracoastal Waterway. However

Chambers County, before all the marsh modifications

half km or less south of the location of the three archeological pimple mound sites. And so in prehistory
the marsh surrounding these sites probably was always
freshwater marsh except for occasions when storm
surges may have swept into the area.
Notably absent from all three sites and presumably from the marshes in this location, is the ubiquitous
brackish water shellfish Rangia cuneata. This is somewhat surprising since Rangia cuneata does live in the
marsh lakes farther downstream and while they do not
spawn in fresh water, larval clams are often swept upstream into freshwater habitats by strong tides and storm
surges and will survive there quite nicely. Nevertheless,
no mollusc shells were found in any of the test excavations there except for two very small fragments apparently of oyster shell recovered from 41JF31A and probably brought to the site location.
It is hard to visualize all, or even many, of the
hundreds of pimple mounds just in this one locality, as
containing archeological deposits. But it is not so hard
to visualize those mounds near the contact between
Pleistocene and Holocene—i.e., between wet and dry—
terrain as being favored locations for use by Native
Americans when engaged in exploiting resources of the
nearby prairie and marsh. While excavating 41JF31B
in the summer of 1970, the field crew’s resident ecologist, Billy M. Davidson, walked over the vicinity and
made the following general notes about plants and animals of the immediate site vicinity.
· Salt dome uplift (Big Hill): high ground with post
and live oaks, some grasses although much disturbed
today; good habitat for rodents, songbirds, and lizards.
· Upland prairie: flat areas with many grasses, ground
covers, and herbs; sedges in low lying areas; good
habitat for birds of prey, ground living birds, etc.;
lots of rabbits observed.
· Marsh: extensive low lying ground with several drainage ditches making the area very disturbed from its
natural state; many ground covers and several

grasses; the main vegetation is sedges of which at
least four species were observed; willow trees were
growing in disturbed areas; prime habitat for rabbits, nutria, water snakes, and alligator; also many
Lepisosteus (i.e., gar) in the canals, and waders and
other marsh birds thrive.”

SITE 41JF31A

The artifacts collected from the excavated three levels
were not abundant so they were all combined and labeled the “lower mound” or “excavated” section. Ceramic seriation of these two consolidated collections
from 41JF31A (see Chapter 2) indicates that this site
was occupied during the early Big Hill Period (Figure
4; Table 2). This was the time when Tchefuncte ceramics were about to fade away, and when Goose Creek
and Baytown plainwares were becoming the major pottery in use.

Excavation procedure
Artifacts
While examining the area south of Big Hill salt
dome for archeological sites in 1965 and 1967, C. N.
Bollich had come across the damaged remains of the
pimple mound that was recorded subsequently as
41JF31A. The upper portion of the mound had been
bladed, removing an estimated 12 to 18 inches off the
top of the mound to provide fill to repair a nearby drainage ditch levee. The truncated mound and periphery
was first examined and a thorough collection was made
of artifacts, mostly sherds, lying about. Many of the
sherds were of early ceramic varieties, especially
Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte and variety
Mandeville, along with Goose Creek sandy paste wares.
Bollich had been seeking a location in which a
stratigraphic test might show whether Goose Creek pottery preceded Tchefuncte varieties in the Sabine, or
vice versa. Since it appeared that some of the lower
part of the mound remained in situ, he thought this
might be a location where the evidence might be sought.
Before making a commitment to a large excavation, in
early 1968 a 3-foot-square (0.9 m) grid unit was staked
out on what appeared to be undisturbed deposits of the
lower part of the mound. This grid unit was excavated
in 6 inch (15 cm) levels and sifted through quarter inch
(0.6 cm) screen. Three such levels were removed before reaching sterile subsoil of the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation (C.N. Bollich, field notes).
As it turned out, Tchefuncte and Goose Creek
ceramics were simultaneously abundant to the bottom
of the cultural layers at the mound (cf. Table 10). Because the results of this small excavation indicated that
the introduction of pottery into the Sabine would not
be found at 41JF31A, the excavation was not continued. To facilitate use of this data, the material collected
from the surface after removal of the upper 12 to 18
inches of the mound was all combined and labeled the
“upper mound” or “dozed” (i.e., bulldozed) section.

Ceramics
Ceramic types and varieties excavated at
41JF31A, as previously explained, are described and
illustrated in Appendix A. The specific frequencies of
ceramic types and vessel attributes from this site are
enumerated in this chapter in Tables 10 and 11; also
see Figures 42 to 47 and Tables 41 and 42.
Lithics
Projectile points. Likewise projectile point types
are described and illustrated in Appendix B. As noted
above, 41JF31A is an early Big Hill Period site and a
mixture of a few dart points and a few arrow points
were recovered there (see Figures 49 to 52 and Tables
46 to 48).
Other biface tools
Small beaked tool, function unknown. This tool
is lanceolate in outline and strongly bi-convex in crosssection (Figure 16, A; Table 12). It appears to have
been hafted and may once have been a drill but through
repeated re-sharpening it has attained its present form
suggesting use as a perforating tool. It is made of pale
brown chert (10YR6/3). There is wear around the peripheral edge and on many of the ridges between flake
scars. Dimensions (mm): maximum length=27; maximum width=12.8; maximum thickness=8.7.
Disc-shaped tool, function unknown. This unusual
tool is a plano-convex piece of chert (10YR7/3, very
pale brown) flaked into a circular disc (see Figure 16,
B; Table 12). There is no indication of hafting but there
is use wear on peripheral edges and ridges between
flake scars. This object was certainly a tool but it is not

Biface tools broken in use
Projectile point fragments. Consistent with the age
of this site, all three of these fragments appear to be
remnants of dart points (see Figure 16, C–E; Table
12). One is a straight-sided stem (chert, 10YR5/1, gray);
one a contracting stem suggestive of the Gary type
(chert, 10YR7/2, light gray); and the last fragment is
the distal section of an elongated blade (chert, 10YR3/

mm long and 20.1 mm wide. The other two fragments
are not sufficiently complete to provide any measurements.

Drill/perforator, stemmed or hand-held. This broken but ubiquitous drill/perforator is suggestive of one
of the expanded base, hand-held forms or possibly a
stemmed form (Figure 16, F; Table 12). The bit is 18.5
mm long and 7.6 mm in diameter; the base expands to
9.8 mm where it was broken off. There is much edge
wear at and near the distal tip. The color and luster of
the flake scars suggests the resource pebble from which
this was made had been heat-treated. The tool is made
of chert (2.5YR3/3, dusky red).
Drill/perforator, bit fragments. In addition, there
were two bit fragments of drill/perforator tools (Table
12). One is a bit shaft fragment measuring 8.8 mm in
diameter; both distal and proximal ends are missing.
This is chert (10YR7/2, light gray). The other specimen is the distal tip of such a tool (Figure 16, G; Table
12) with the bit measuring 9.3 mm in diameter. This
tool was made from quartzite (5YR5/2, reddish gray).

TOTALS

The distal tip and nearby ridges between flake scars
exhibit much use wear.
Biface tool failures in manufacture
Projectile point/knife failures. Four specimens
appear to be attributable to this class. The first specimen appears to have been intended to be the blade,
starting at the distal tip, but was apparently discarded
as a result of the vuggy chert material being used (Fig-

180

ure 16, J; Table 12). The remaining projectile point/
knife failures were apparently intended to be stemmed
points. The first one is the crudely formed stem and
blade of an unfinished point (Figure 16, K; Table 12).
This was being made from silicified wood (5YR4/2,
dark reddish gray); measurements were not taken. The
remaining two fragments were being made from chert
(7.5YR8/4, pink; 5YR4/3, reddish brown). Because their
forms are so ambivalent they are not measured or illustrated.

Chapter 4: Archeological Reconnaissance of Pimple (Prairie) Mound Sites

Uniface tools
Edged convenience tools. Six flakes have not been
shaped into any tool form but have had many flakes
unifacially (usually) removed along one edge. Presumably these flakes were at hand when some task was
being performed and a cutting, or perhaps scraping,
tool was needed (Table 12). Some of these are illustrated in Figure 16, L–N. All six are made of chert.
Debris from lithic tool manufacturing
Unmodified pebbles, too small. Five small, wellrounded pebbles were found, the largest being 15 mm
in diameter (Table 12). These pebbles are too large to
be naturally occurring constituents of local sedimentary
deposits in the Sabine, and they are too small to be
used as resource material for lithic tool making. They
could have been used as noisemakers in a rattle but
there is no indication of the other parts needed for a
rattle such as a small turtle shell. Perhaps these are
gastroliths residual from butchering an alligator.
Flakes. A small collection of flakes residual from
lithic tool manufacture or maintenance was recovered
(Tables 12 and 13). These included primary cortex
flakes, secondary cortex flakes, lipped or biface thinning flakes, and interior thinning or resharpening flakes.
Other utilitarian artifacts
Pumice, modified and unmodified. Two pieces of
pumice scavenged from the Gulf beach were found
(Table 12). The smaller piece (Figure 16, R) has a channel-shaped depression possibly the result of using the
piece to abrade or otherwise shape a cylindrical object
such as wood or bone. The larger piece (Figure 16, S)
has no facets to indicate it had been used for any purpose up to the time it was left at the site.
Asphalt. One large lump of asphalt and two pieces
of midden deposit upon which molten asphalt apparently had fallen or dripped were included in the material found (Figure 16, P; Table 12). This material also
is typically scavenged from the Gulf beach where it
washes ashore probably from undersea oil seeps and is
commonly found at Gulf coast archeological sites. On
the upper Texas coast, heated asphalt is used for hafting tools, waterproofing containers, and for repairing
cracked ceramic vessels. Aside from an impression of a
blade of grass or something similar, there are no im-

51

pressions on any of the asphalt pieces to suggest what
activity they were used for.
Miscellaneous
Oyster shell. Two very small fragments of mollusc shell appear to be oyster (Table 12). None of the
fragments (10 and 15 mm diameter respectively) is
Rangia cuneata. Either an occasional shellfish was
brought back to the site or the shell fragments were in
the gut of another animal such as alligator.
SITE 41JF26
Excavation procedure
With the results of exploring 41JF31A in hand, it
was decided to excavate a very small area in another
badly damaged mound in 1967 to see whether more
pimple mounds contained archeological deposits. About
100 meters or so west of 41JF31A was another mound,
recorded later as 41JF26, which had been quarried for
sand from the center outward, eliminating most of the
mound, although a small section of one side remained
with a more or less vertical face. As it was later learned,
this mound also had been a location dug out extensively by a trapper resident in the area and who had
given a collection to The University of Texas containing Marksville Stamped pottery (Dieckman 1960). An
excavation unit was marked off that was 5 feet (1.5 m)
long by 2½ feet (0.75 m) wide at the top of the remaining section of mound and this was excavated in 6 inch
(15 cm) levels to a depth of 6 levels.
Again, artifacts were found and in this instance, it
was possible to see that the archeological material was
stratified most intensively in the middle of the vertical
accumulation of mound sediment. The artifacts this time
included one diagnostic early ceramic sherd along with
an arrow point and a somewhat later ceramic assemblage and faunal remains. The sherd collection seriated
to late Big Hill Period (Figure 4). This convinced us to
excavate a full-sized stratigraphic test in an undisturbed
pimple mound.

pimple mound known as 41JF26 range from late Big
Hill Period to post early ceramic (see Figure 4, Table 2,
and Table 42). As previously explained, ceramics are
described and illustrated in Appendix A. The specific
frequencies of ceramics from this site are enumerated
in this chapter in Table 14; see also Table 15 for ceramic vessel attributes in this sample.

41JF26 is reddish gray chert (2.5YR6/1) and is 13.9
mm long with a present bit diameter of 3 mm. The tool
was bifacially chipped from a flake and while the bit is
very short it has slight wear on the tip suggesting the bit
may have been reduced to its present length by attrition
through continued use.
Debris from lithic tool manufacturing

Lithics
Projectile points. Likewise projectile point types
are described and illustrated in Appendix B. As noted
above, 41JF26 is a relatively late early ceramic site and
no dart points were excavated there, although four arrow points were found (see Table 14, Figure 49, and
Tables 46 and 48.

Flakes. While a number of lithic flakes were recovered (Tables 14 and 16) there were no primary cortex flakes and relatively few secondary cortex flakes
indicating the primary activity at this site was re-sharpening existing artifacts and possibly finishing bifaces
from preforms. The preponderance of lithic material
was chert pebbles with the occasional flake of silicified
wood and of quartzite.

Other biface tools
Other utilitarian artifacts
Drill/perforator, small elongate. The only other
tool recovered in this small test excavation was a bifacially chipped hand-held drill or perforator, or both (Figure 16, H, Table 14). This is a very common form in
southeast Texas and has an elongate bit and expanded
proximal end presumably for holding; possibly it could
have been hafted, but the expanded end usually is irregularly shaped and inconvenient for hafting. This tool
form, while rather standard, comes executed in a variety of sizes ranging from virtually a microflint as the
one here is, to tools twice or more larger in length, bit
diameter, and size of proximal end. This specimen from

Asphalt. The only other artifact class recovered
was a couple of lumps of asphalt, one a centimeter in
diameter and the other about twice as large (Table 14).
Asphalt presumably is collected from the Gulf beach
where it floats ashore as previously described.

*=surface find

Investigations at the badly damaged 41JF26 and
41JF31A were primarily to determine the likelihood that
stratified archeological deposits were incorporated within
these mounds and not merely draped over the surface
at some time after mound formation. Documentation
of stratification and sediments was not made. However, 41JF31B was documented more thoroughly and,
as previously noted, a preliminary report has been published (Aten and Bollich 1981).
Work began by clearing the tall marsh grasses from
the mound and immediate vicinity to facilitate site mapping and making a photographic record (Figures 17 and
18). Because of the simple topography, a relief map of

the site was made using a tape and level line extended
from a stake benchmark at the apex of the mound (Figure 19).
The 41JF31B mound was shaped like a dome or
a truncated cone and had a height of about 1 m from
the intermound area to the mound’s crest (Figures 18
and 19). At the outer edge of the dome, just before
reaching the intermound area, the base of the mound’s
profile was interrupted by what appears to be an eroded
nick point. This indentation also was mirrored in the
subsurface stratification of the profile trench at the edge
of the mound (Figure 19).

grid units were staked and each was excavated in 10
cm levels to a depth of about 1.1 m where sterile Beaumont Formation subsoil was encountered. The excavated sediment was water-screened through both 1/2
inch (12 mm) and 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) screen. Specimens were placed in plastic bags labeled for each grid
square and level. This excavation encountered a habitation zone stratified within the mound (Figure 20) and
produced mostly early ceramics and faunal remains
along with a few other tools. Records and specimens
from 41JF31B are curated at TARL at The University
of Texas at Austin.
Mound structure
The deposits within the mound seem to consist of
four zones with gradational contacts (Figure 19). Unfortunately, over the past 30 years the original soil
samples from zones 1 and 4 have been misplaced and
their lithologic descriptions given here are those made
in the field at the time of excavation. Underlying the
mounds and comprising the intermound areas is the
Quaternary Beaumont Formation (zone 1), here a light
brownish gray silty clay with prominent olive colored
mottles and abundant iron concretions. No archeological material was found in this zone.
The next higher lithology was zone 2 (Table 17),
which is a light brownish gray (10YR6/2) very fine
sandy and clayey silt with abundant olive colored
mottles and abundant large iron concretions compared
to the succeeding zone 3 (Table 17). Concretionary
encrustations on some of the archeological material is
evidence that the concretion-forming process occurred
or continued in the last 2 millennia (i.e., the approximate age of the early ceramic artifacts incorporated in

the mound) and may be continuing to the present. The
average pH of zone 2 is 7.84 or slightly alkaline. A few
archeological artifacts and faunal remains were recovered from zone 2 (cf. levels 90-100 and 100-110) very
possibly because of displacement by gophers or other
burrowing animals. The field notes record encountering sediment-filled animal burrows in the bottom two
excavation levels as well as at higher elevations in the
test pits.
Zone 2 may correlate with the Beaumont Formation paleosol or possibly the Wallisville Paleosol (Nordt
et al. 1998) recognized along the lower Trinity River, at
Black Hill Mound (41JF24), and at the Gaulding site
(4lJF27) discussed in Chapters 5 and 6 respectively.
This paleosol zone, along with an occasional thin veneer of black, peaty marsh sediment, often appears to
form the surface of the intermound areas as well as the
surface upon which the mound formed. Under the center of the mound the upper surface of this paleosol
appears to be 15 to 20 cm higher than on the periphery
and intermound areas (Figure 19). Combined with the
nick point morphology the indication is that the
intermound areas have been somewhat eroded during
storm surges (Sol Aronow, personal communication)
or perhaps during periods of higher than present sea
level (cf. Aten and Bollich 2002:77–83).
Next higher is zone 3 (Table 17), a dark gray
(10YR4/1) very fine sandy silt with mm-sized and
smaller incipient iron concretions, olive-colored iron
mottles, and very fine flakes of unidentifiable organic
material; the average pH of this sample was 6.51 or
slightly acidic. This zone, clearly visible in the excavation profile (Figure 20), incorporates the majority of
the original habitation deposits and artifacts even though
there evidently has been some dispersion of these by

burrowing animals. Aside from the post-depositional
process of iron concretion formation, the grain size composition of zones 2 and 3 is practically identical save
for a very slightly greater clay content below in zone 2
(dry lumps could not be broken apart by hand but readily
dissolved in water).
Finally, the highest zone is zone 4, a light gray
brown silt. No additional descriptions are available for
this deposit. However, aside from iron concretion formation, the great similarity between grain sizes in zones
2 and 3 and the general absence of clay in the mound
above zone 2 suggests that the mounds have been
formed by reworking and re-depositing the superficial
paleosol of the Beaumont Formation. At this location
the original Beaumont Formation surficial sediments had
been deposited in a distributary channel and associated
levees (Figure 15), deposits that had greater permeability (less clay) than the nearby interdistributary basin
deposits. These presumably would be easier to erode
from the local Beaumont paleosol, but how they came
to be redeposited in meter-high, dome-shaped mound
features still is not clear.
One of the popular mound formation mechanisms
often cited is that such redistribution can be due to
wind blowing sand and silt into clumps of vegetation
where it is caught. This seems inherently unlikely in the
present instance mainly because vegetation here is not
clumped but rather grows thickly over the entire area
on and between mounds (cf. Figure 17). There are no
other eolian geomorphic features in the immediate vicinity except at the Gulf beach several km south. Neither can we suggest the much older middle Holocene
Altithermal as the likely era when mound-forming oc-

curred. The principal observation that can be made here
is that the formation of these particular mounds is recent, with zone 3 probably dating somewhere on the
order of 2000 years ago—the age of the incorporated
ceramics—and indeed may be continuing to the present.
We cannot say much else about how pimple mounds
formed at Pipkin Ranch except that presumably their
elevation in an intermittently wet terrain was attractive
to prehistoric peoples as a location for temporary habitation. For further discussion of the Pipkin Ranch pimple
mounds and how they may have been used in the past,
see Aten and Bollich (1981).
Artifacts
Notwithstanding the evidence for disturbance
noted in the test pits at 41JF31B—6 mm wide desiccation cracks refilled with sediment to a depth of at least
40 cm, and gopher burrows here and there all the way
to the bottom of the mound—the artifacts substantially
clustered in levels 4 through 8 and a distinct organic
enriched midden zone was visible from 50 to 80 cm
depth. Artifact proveniences may be found in Tables
18, 19, and 20.
Ceramics
Seriated ceramic assemblages from this site span
the entire duration of both the Orange and Big Hill periods in the Sabine (Figure 4, Table 2). Specific proveniences of sherds and vessel attributes can be found in
Tables 18 and 19. Descriptions and illustrations are contained in Appendix A.

Lithics

Debris from lithic tool manufacturing

Biface tools

Bipolar core. This is a stream worn resource
pebble of yellowish brown (10YR5/6 to 10YR5/8) chert.
Its original size was not much greater than its present
dimensions. A large flake was removed from one end,
possibly using the bipolar technique as suggested by
small rebound flakes removed from the opposite end.
The core was then discarded apparently because there
were too many irregularities and imperfections for satisfactory chipped tool manufacture. This pebble is 42.9
mm long, 26.7 mm wide, and 18.2 mm thick.
Flakes. Flakes of chert, silicified wood, and quartzite were recovered from the coarse and fine screens
combined (Tables 20 and 21). They ranged widely in
color from yellowish to dark browns. Examination with
the 10× binocular microscope did not reveal evidence
that any of these flakes had been used as convenience
tools. The materials used were mostly chert with lesser
amounts of silicified wood and quartzite. The types of
flakes suggest that all phases of reduction were carried

Dart point. Likewise, the lone projectile point
found in the oldest level of the Orange Period deposits
was described and illustrated in Appendix B. Also see
Table 20.
Biface tools broken in use
Drill/perforator, small elongate. This is the proximal end of a small, expanded base perforating tool (Figure 16, I); it was made from a dusky red (2.5YR4/3)
chert. No use wear is evident. The available measurements are: maximum width=5.5 mm; and thickness=2.0
mm. The “hand-hold” of this tool was made on a narrow biface thinning flake (the proximal end is the flake’s
striking platform) by unifacial flaking along the opposite sides of the base; the bit is gone but may have been
bifacially chipped to create the necessary form.

out on resource pebbles that were generally not more
than 30 to 40 cm in maximum dimension (Table 21).
Bone tools
Socketed point, blunt form. This blunt point is
made from a small diameter long bone of a large animal
(Figure 16, O; Table 20). The distal tip is open as well
as the proximal end which contains much of the original asphalt(?) adhesive and a well-defined mold of the
shaft on which the point was mounted. This point is
much like the previously reported blunt points made
from deer phalanges (Aten 1983:262–263). Its function seems to have been to shock or stun its target
rather than to penetrate, raising the suspicion that it
may have been used to capture or kill birds without
damaging or staining their plumage. The point is only
33.0 mm long and 12.5 mm in diameter; the maximum
diameter of the shaft, at least where it was hafted was
6.5 mm.
Other utilitarian artifacts
Sandstone, unmodified. A small chip about 1 cm
square of a fine- to medium-grained sandstone may
have been used as, or was broken from, an abrader
(Table 20). The sandstone appears to be of fluvial origin, containing heavy minerals and selenite as well as
quartz sand; the cement is not calcareous.
Pumice, faceted and unmodified. There were five
pieces of various shades of gray pumice that must have
been collected on the Gulf beach for use as abraders
(Table 20). The piece from level 50-60 cm (Figure 16,
Q) has grooves from its use. Other pieces have more or
less flat facets that may result from use.

Asphalt. Two small pieces of asphalt were recovered from the habitation levels (Table 20). As discussed
previously, this is a substance commonly collected on
upper Gulf coast beaches and used for cementing and
sealing purposes.
Late historic debris
Excavated from near the top of the test pit were a
fragment of bakelite, two shotgun shell casings, and a
22 caliber shell casing (Table 20).
SUBSISTENCE FAUNA
A good faunal sample was recovered from the
test pits at 41JF31B where all excavated fill was waterscreened through coarse and fine screens, as described
earlier under “Excavation Procedures.” The recovery
from the fine screen (1/16 inch or 1.6 mm mesh) was
not great, however. While excavating at 41JF31B, a
bulk matrix sample was obtained from 41JF26 and water-screened just to see if a significant number of small
faunal materials had been overlooked there. The result
here as well was that some but not a lot of small bones
were recovered in the fine screen. So, with the understanding that probably some fauna went unrecovered
in that small exploratory test, the majority was and so
those 41JF26 results are presented as well. No fauna
was recovered from 41JF31A, however.
41JF26 fauna
Some 250 identifiable vertebrate specimens were
recovered (Table 22) indicating a fair variety for what
must have been a small occupation even if repeated

from time to time. As indicated earlier, on the whole,
the ceramic assemblage from 41JF26 seems later in
time than the 41JF31A and B collections even though a
few sherds of Tchefuncte-related ceramics were found.
Transforming the data into number of identified specimens by animal class (Figure 21, Table 23), there are
some trends that develop from the early to the later
levels in the excavation. The proportion of fish significantly decreases and small-terrestrials seem to decrease
somewhat, while large terrestrial-aquatics may increase
late in the site’s history, and small terrestrial-aquatics
and large-terrestrials fluctuate but remain in roughly the
same proportions through the site’s use.
41JF31B fauna
Somewhat over 500 identifiable vertebrate specimens were recovered from the test pits at this site

(Tables 24 and 25). Although the animal bones were
generally in good condition, the pH of the buried habitation zone was measured at 6.51, slightly acidic, and
the possible long-term impact of this soil condition on
bone preservation cannot be discounted. However, neither can it be quantitatively evaluated at this time. It
seems likely that material in the upper levels and the
very lowest levels has been displaced from the habitation zone between 40 and 90 cm. For purposes of trying to see chronological shifts in faunal use at this site,
the recovery from levels 5 and 6, level 7, and levels 8
and 9 were used as analytical units (see Figure 21).
The animal class proportions from these levels was plotted to see what changes may have occurred. Little or
no change occurred among the small-terrestrials and
the fish, while increases took place over time in the use
of large terrestrial-aquatics, and a decline occurred in
use of small terrestrial-aquatics. To see better the con-

trast between early ceramic faunal exploitation and the
same at a later time, the animal class proportions for
41JF26 also are plotted on Figure 21 and, save for birds
and small-terrestrials; the remaining pattern of faunal
use is quite different. This issue will be revisited in
Chapter 8 where data from the several sites will be

CONCLUSIONS
A number of archeological sites or historical references associated with pimple mounds have been found
on the northern Gulf coast in the past four decades:
north of Houston (Moore and Donachie 2001:60);
Pipkin Ranch near the Sabine as reported here; near
Beaumont at OR34 also reported here; near Lake
Charles, Louisiana (Bonnin 1972); and in Vermilion
Parish, Louisiana (Jones and Shuman 1988). There may
well be others. Most of these reports seem to indicate
the archeology was draped over the mound surface and
confined to the upper portion of the mound deposits.
The Pipkin Ranch sites are different: the habitation zone
is more clearly defined and is incorporated within the
stratification of the mounds; artifacts and faunal remains are more abundant; and the periods of occupation vary from site to site (or mound to mound).
The origin of pimple mounds is a subject that has
generated a very large literature (Aten and Bollich 1981;

Washburn 1988) mostly characterized by efforts to identify the means of their formation. But given their occurrence over so many and diverse regions of North
America the likelihood is their similarity in form is only
superficial and there is more than one formation process. However, the Pipkin Ranch sites unequivocally
tell us something about the origin of pimple mounds
dotting the surface of late Pleistocene Beaumont Formation geomorphology on the northern Gulf coast. Most
important is that they are primarily aggradational features as evidenced by the archeological deposits that
were stratified well within several of the mounds as
they were progressively elevating through some as yet
unidentified geologic depositional process. It seems unlikely that this process of sedimentary accumulation is
related to sand and silt being trapped by clumped vegetation since there is no clumping to the area’s vegetation at least in the present day. It is possible that the
clumping existed in the past, say during the arid Middle
Holocene Altithermal, but the archeology discovered
so far is not even remotely as old as that. So identifying
the mechanism for aggradation remains an open question.
While the pimple mounds are affected by burrowing rodents and by desiccation cracks that relocate
sediment and archeological materials downward in the
mound this is not the explanation for the archeology
and does not obviate the significance of aggradation for

at least two reasons. First, the artifacts, when organized stratigraphically, form vertical assemblages similar to those seen stratigraphically in many other site
locations in the Sabine and in the Trinity River delta
area, something that could not be randomly created by
desiccation cracks and gravity, or by rodents and their
burrowing. And second, archeological site structures—
in this case the dark organic-stained layer where the
majority of the archeological deposit occurred—remained distinct and relatively undisturbed (Figure 20)
despite either of these conditions.
While mound formation is primarily aggradational,
erosion probably does play a role by carrying away
sediment washed down from the top of the domeshaped feature into the inter-mound area. The principal
evidence for this is the existence of nick points around
the mound periphery, and the fact these must have been
created by an erosional process.

At Pipkin Ranch, the evidence from the three
mounds examined indicates those human occupations
extended, probably intermittently, from the early Orange Period (circa 2500 years ago) into the Late Prehistoric, or post-early ceramic (age uncertain). The assemblages contained a diversity of pottery types and
varieties as well as evidence of the shift from dart points
hafted on large diameter shafts to arrow points hafted
on narrow diameter light-weight shafts. Additionally there
was an elementary tool kit of drill/perforators, knives
(usually as unifacial convenience tools), a socketed bone
blunt point, pumice abraders and asphalt. Notably absent in this relatively remote locality were scrapers,
hammerstones, and ornamental artifacts such as beads
and pendants.
In addition there are interesting successional patterns in the faunal assemblages over the Orange and
Big Hill periods which may only be particular to the

remote coastal marshes where these sites were found.
No bird bones were found and use of small-terrestrial
animals remained slight. Taking large-terrestrial (mainly
deer) and small terrestrial-aquatic animals tended to
decline. And taking large terrestrial-aquatics (i.e., alligators) and fish increased. Also as mentioned earlier,
no shellfish food remains were found at all. At the beginning of the early ceramic, the major hunting focus
was on large-terrestrials and small terrestrial-aquatics—

69

deer and marsh-dwelling animals. By the end of the
early ceramic, focus was still high on deer, but less so,
and much more on alligators and fish.
Finally, the last archeological conclusion that is
drawn from this work at Pipkin Ranch is to recognize
that pimple mounds found in an environmental context
conducive to prehistoric Native American use should
be examined carefully in the subsurface for potential
archeological evidence.

Chapter 5

RECONNAISSANCE AT BLACK HILL MOUND (41JF24)

INTRODUCTION

LANDSCAPE SETTING

One of the key elements of reviewing early ceramic archeology in the Sabine Lake Area was to obtain a better understanding of the Black Hill Mound
(41JF24). Also known as the Tyrrell Park Mound, Black
Hill is located along Hillebrandt Bayou some 12 km
(about 7 ¼ miles) south of downtown Beaumont, Texas
(Figure 1). It remains an intriguing site despite being
the target over the last century of random digging for
treasure and later for Indian artifacts. The low, moundlike form containing human burials embedded in earth
midden along with Tchefuncte ceramics and other distinctive artifacts and domestic debris raised the question whether this apparent early ceramic site was simply a habitation location used later for interments or
was it perhaps a burial mound similar to the Tchefuncte
culture mounds of south Louisiana (cf., Ford and
Quimby 1945:21–24; Gibson 1976:45). If it was a prehistoric location with ritual, ceremonial, and/or spiritual
features, this would be the first such early ceramic
coastal location documented west of Lafayette, Louisiana, and would elevate the general perception of cultural complexity among prehistoric peoples of the
Sabine.
Since the City of Beaumont, Texas, now owns
the site it was necessary to apply for a Texas Antiquities Permit to gain access and permission to undertake
minor excavations and documentation. The purpose of
field work under the permit was twofold: To attempt to
better understand what kind of site Black Hill was—
was it a built mound or a midden accumulation; and to
estimate the site’s potential to yield additional useful
information should field work be undertaken there at
some time in the future. The following chapter is adapted
from and incorporates some sections verbatim from
our unpublished report in fulfillment of Texas Antiquities Committee Archeology Permit Number 2902 (Aten
and Bollich 2004).

Black Hill is situated on the middle reaches of
Hillebrandt Bayou, the principal tributary of Taylor
Bayou that channels runoff from all of central Jefferson
County (Figure 1). Hillebrandt Bayou has been artificially channelized since before 1938, the year when the
earliest U.S. Department of Agriculture aerial photographs of the Taylor Bayou and Hillebrandt Bayou drainage basins were taken. Consequently, there are no known
pre-channelization images of Hillebrandt Bayou to examine.
What does exist are numerous air photo images
taken since 1938 showing abandoned channel segments
on either side of the ruler-straight present channel, and
a base map accompanying the 1915 Jefferson County
soil survey (Carter et al. 1915) on which the rendering
of Hillebrandt and of nearby Willow Marsh bayou includes, rather faithfully, many of those cut-off channel
segments that still are visible on air photographs. As a
result, the probable pre-20th century fluvial geography
near Black Hill Mound is reconstructed from the visible channel segments on air photos with connections
between them as estimated from the 1915 soil map
(Figure 22). This may not be precisely the configuration during the time the site was in use, but the narrow
stream valley and relatively few stranded channel segments suggests it cannot be far wrong.
For many years, informal opinion about Black
Hill Mound was that it probably was a pimple mound
site. Several such sites, where archeological deposits
were incorporated within aggradational sediments of
pimple mound features, have been recognized in the
Sabine in recent years and so this was a reasonable
hypothesis. However, the combination of information
from investigating unquestioned pimple mound sites,
such as 41JF31B at Pipkin Ranch (Chapter 4, this volume; Aten and Bollich 1981), with examination of air
photo evidence from the Black Hill locality makes this

Figure 22. Probable original channels (solid and dashed lines)
of Hillebrandt and Willow Marsh bayous near Black Hill
Mound (41JF24) before 20th century channelization (dotted
lines). See Figure 1 for location in region. See text for sources.

site association no longer seem plausible.
For the most part, the channel of Hillebrandt
Bayou occupies the topographic or interdistributary lowland between Pleistocene meander belt ridges that wend
across the surface of the Beaumont Formation (Aronow
1971:Figure 22). Pimple mounds in this region are associated with Pleistocene meander belt ridges and where
they occur they are very close to each other and are

present in large numbers (Aten and Bollich 1981). This
is unlike the Black Hill Mound locality where the site is
the only mound at present and no others are evident in
the adjacent area either on the ground or on air photographs of the locality taken prior to nearby construction of levees and artificial wetlands.
Despite this, local lore has it that one or two other
mounds similar to Black Hill once existed along
Hillebrandt or Willow Marsh bayous but their locations
are presently unknown even though there has been intensive on-the-ground searching (Greene 2003, 2004;
Long 1963). If they ever existed they may have been
destroyed during repeated channel straightening and
widening flood control projects over the years, or perhaps they remain hidden in dense brush that covers
parts of the area.
The sediments of the Pleistocene interdistributary
basins are predominantly clays that offer poor drainage. Consequently, the vegetation of the wet, muddy
terrain bordering the original Hillebrandt channel in the
region of Black Hill Mound is fluvial woodland including numerous water-tolerant trees and shrubs such as
bald cypress, sweet gum, black willow, water ash, water oak, dwarf palmetto, Chinese tallow, and others
(White et al. 1987:Plate V). At varying distances away
from the stream channel and fluvial woodlands, the
interfluve landscape changes to upland prairies dotted
with small, usually intermittent lakes formed in abandoned Pleistocene stream channels.
Investigations at the nearby Gaulding site indicate
that since about 2000 years ago, more or less the expected age of early ceramic sites in the Sabine Lake
area, sea level has risen about 1 to 1.5 m (Aten and
Bollich 2002:77–83). One consequence of this would
be a filling of the incised Hillebrandt stream valley and
expansion of peripheral freshwater marshes. Because
of these landscape controls on the biotic environment,
the environment of Black Hill in early ceramic times
may have resembled that described above but with less
extensive fluvial wetlands than exist today.
PRIOR SITE DISTURBANCES
Black Hill Mound has been known to people living in central Jefferson County throughout the 20th century, and perhaps earlier than that, but at least since the
locality was first cleared of trees near the beginning of
the 20th century (Long 1963). Once cleared, the mound’s
physical character would have been strikingly obvious:

Chapter 5: Reconnaissance at Black Hill Mound (41JF24)

73

a small dome-shaped hill some 90 feet (27 m) across
and from 3 to 6 feet (about 1-2 m) high set in an otherwise flat terrain (Figure 23). The sediment comprising
the hill was very dark colored while it was surrounded
in all directions by a pale yellowish brown sandy silt
soil—thus the name “Black Hill.”
One of the enduring myths in southeast Texas
folklore is about buried treasure (e.g., Block 1973:15–
16; Jamison 1959). Locations with unusual physical
features occasionally became the focus of such interest
and it was Black Hill’s misfortune to become the target
of treasure hunters apparently early in the 20th century
(Long 1963). In any event, all accounts agree that substantial digging in the mound had occurred many years
before 1963 when uncontrolled recovery began of the
archeological materials discussed here.
At mid-century, Professor Russell Long, a biologist at Lamar State College of Technology (now Lamar
University), had been using the woods that had grown
up by that time near Tyrrell Park as a field area for
students; at that time he was shown the mound by a
local resident (Long 1963). While believing the location
to be an Indian mound, Long noted anomalous yellow
clay at the top of the mound and invited geologist Sol
Aronow, also of Lamar State College, to examine Black
Hill in 1962 or 1963 (Aronow 1997).
Aronow recognized the situation as a case of reversed stratigraphy; the treasure diggers decades earlier
apparently penetrated through the black sediment of
the mound into underlying yellow clay of the Beaumont Formation; the yellow clay from the bottom of
their hole thus ended up on top of the backdirt they had
thrown out previously (Figure 24). The apparent location of the “treasure” pit, barely seen in the background
of Figure 24, was still evident as a large depression in
2003, and its location is plotted on Figure 25. In any
event, when the yellow clay was reached the treasure
diggers evidently saw the futility of going deeper.
In the early 1960s, Prof. Long’s students and other
collectors began visiting the site to dig for Indian artifacts. Although Professor Aronow believed the site had
been extremely disturbed, further digging nevertheless
ensued (Long 1963; Heartfield 1964; Aronow 1997).
Around the beginning of 1963—the precise date is not
known—Prof. Aronow, assisted by Charles T. Butler,
a sociology instructor at Lamar State College and a part
owner of the Black Hill property, prepared a topographic
map of the mound (Figure 25) as it existed at that time
(Butler 1963). As noted above, backdirt from the trea-

sure hole was piled on top of the mound and exaggerated its height on the Aronow map by some 3 feet (1
m).
Around 1965, Beaumont resident Lorraine
Heartfield Greene and others made efforts to clean out
prior potholes and to record as much information about
the site as possible (Figure 25). She arranged to update
the 1963 Aronow map to reflect the digging and burials
found in 1965 (Heartfield 1964). She also submitted
the first site survey form and arranged for the human
skeletal remains found at the site to be deposited in the
human osteology collection at TARL at The University
of Texas at Austin. Additionally, she recorded many of
the artifacts recovered by the student diggers and, while
an undergraduate student herself at The University of
Texas, prepared a class report on the lithics and other
non-ceramic artifacts. Ms. Greene generously made
available the original copy of this report (Heartfield n.d.).
Her descriptions and excellent artifact drawings have
been used here extensively, with her permission, to prepare an updated description of the 41JF24 tool assemblage.
Over the years Prof. Long had gathered a large
collection of potsherds and other artifacts from the student diggers and ultimately he gave the sherds to C. N.
Bollich. Bollich recognized the Tchefuncte culture characteristics of many of the ceramics and the probable
early ceramic cultural affiliation of the site. As interest
in the area’s early ceramics began to incorporate the
ceramics from Black Hill, the physical character of the
site itself also became an issue for consideration.
The descriptions of the Lafayette (Louisiana) and
other Tchula Period mounds (Ford and Quimby
1945:21–24; Gibson 1996) were reviewed and there
were notable similarities: comparable physical dimensions; similar black midden matrix dense with domestic
debris; several burials; comparably-aged artifacts; and
the possibility that not just one but rather a cluster of
two or three mounds once existed in the same vicinity.
The potential for Black Hill Mound to expand understanding of early ceramic cultures in the Sabine was so
great that it seemed another look at this site was warranted.
INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES
When approaching Black Hill today, its mounded
appearance from 1965 (Figure 23) is still unmistakable
despite the presence of more dense underbrush. A great

deal of digging has taken place since 1963 when Prof.
Aronow prepared his topographic map of the mound
proper (Figure 25), although none appears to have occurred in recent years. The six-foot-high conical peak
of the mound, which probably was accentuated by piled
backdirt from the early treasure hunting, has disappeared and the central area of the mound is now a large
depression with a periphery rising only about 2 feet (60
cm) above the general terrain level. Beyond this large
hole, smaller conical depressions from individual potholes dot the surface and one gets the impression that
much of the digging must have been in previously dug
locations—that is, people often may have been churning each other’s backdirt. There is less evidence of potholes toward the mound’s periphery, although everywhere mingled among the potholes are many disturbances from rotted tree stumps and animal burrows.
However, the recovery of several undisturbed burials
in 1963-1965 clearly indicates that some in situ deposits remained to be penetrated.

Before visiting the site, the artifact and human
osteology collections, maps, records, correspondence,
and photographs curated at TARL (The University of
Texas at Austin), and most of those known about in
private collections were studied. In light of this, the
2003 field objectives were to: (1) re-determine the site’s
location; (2) estimate the extent of remaining undisturbed deposits; (3) obtain some documentation of the
nature of mound deposition; (4) obtain one or more
radiocarbon samples, based on previous reports of
Rangia cuneata shells being incorporated in the deposit; and (5) seek evidence of a midden or a borrow
pit from which the mound fill might have been dug by
early ceramic peoples.
Initially, the area near the merging of Willow Marsh
Bayou and Hillebrandt Bayou was searched for the site.
A great deal of construction had taken place since 1965
to build levees and other structures for a municipal artificial wetland and bird sanctuary, and there was no certainty that Black Hill Mound survived. The probable

Ms. Greene had later mapped the location of the linear, 30-foot (nearly 8 m)
long trench that students and collectors
dug in 1965 (Figure 26). This trench is
still quite clearly delineated on the ground
and was surveyed in relation to the new
benchmark; this feature was an important basis for correlating Aronow’s map
with the expanded one shown in Figure
27. The 1965 map of the trench was
overlaid on the new map of the trench
made in relation to the 2003 benchmark;
while the correlation may not be exact,
it seems to be very close as discussed
below. The new mapping also included
locating centers and approximate diameter of all the visible potholes surveyed
in relation to the new benchmark and
plotting their outline on the 2003 site map.

to disclose subtle changes (if there were any)
in the mound deposit, and for this we used
a small backhoe (18 inch wide shovel). A
short profile trench (Trench #1) was begun
very near the apparent edge of the mound
and it was extended radially outward across
the “level” surface beyond (Figure 27). Data
from the exposed stratigraphic profile along
with sediment samples, information from
the Test Pit 1 excavation, from the 1965
and 2003 mapping, and field notes made in
1965 by Dr. Bollich were combined to reconstruct a profile of the site’s structure that
is discussed later.
EXCAVATIONS, 1963-1965
As best it can be determined, the artifacts, burials, and other data now available
for study from prior to the 2003 work were
all obtained between 1963 and 1965. Since

known were made in January 1965 by C. N. Bollich
and concern the sediments and structure of the site
when the large central hole was open. He noted that
near the center and base of the mound there was a
limited area of apparently pinkish sediment possibly discolored by a fire pit of some sort. He recorded that the
sediment under the center of the mound’s base was
“yellow clay” (see Figure 24). He augered to a depth of
4 feet (about 1.2 m) down from the bottom of the
mound and recovered only yellowish brown Beaumont
clay with abundant and large calcium carbonate concretions.
Bollich then went just past the edge of the mound
and augered to a depth of about 20 inches (about 0.5
m) from the ground surface. There he noted the sediment was more or less tan sandy clay changing to a
yellowish color at the bottom of the auger hole. There
were no carbonate concretions at this location, only
directly under the mound. Neither were there any cultural materials evident in the auger hole at the mound
periphery. Another auger probe was made at another
location just at the mound periphery with similar results. While these observations were largely qualitative
they correlate very well with stratigraphic profiles documented in 2003 to be described later.
A total of six burials (eight individuals) were recovered from this central excavation pit. The first of
these, discovered in early 1963 was said to be a flexed
adult female skeleton accompanied by skeletal elements
of two infants. Identification of the adult as female was
apparently an assumption based on the presence of the
infant bones and not from analysis by a physical anthropologist. In any event, these three individuals were
excavated from near the top of the mound’s center (Butler 1963; Long 1963). The horizontal location of these
individuals was not recorded (and so they are not plotted on Figures 25 and 27) but it is possible—perhaps
even likely—that this burial postdates the final construction and use of the Black Hill Mound.
At some later time, after the central pit had been
considerably more excavated, five additional burials
were removed from near the bottom of the mound.
The horizontal locations of these burials were plotted
on the Aronow map (Figure 25), but the only record of
their depth is from Dr. Bollich’s notes which state that
the burials found in the basal part of the mound were
about six inches above the base of the dark brown
mound deposit. Information on the human osteology
worksheets from TARL indicate that the five burials

consisted of two adults and three sub-adults; sex of all
was indeterminate and no pathological conditions were
recorded. Likewise, no record was made of any artifacts accompanying the burials although it seems likely
that some of the artifacts to be described were grave
goods.
EXCAVATIONS, 2003
As noted earlier, fieldwork in 2003 emphasized
further documentation of the surface morphology of
the site and its vicinity as much or more than excavation. Excavations were confined to a 1 m2 test pit dug
in 10 cm levels until penetrating the mound deposit at
about a depth of one meter; and a profile trench, on the
opposite side of the mound, that was 18 inches (45 cm)
wide and 25 feet (7.6 m) long.
Test Pit 1 was located between the edge of the
abandoned channel of Hillebrandt Bayou and the apparent edge of the mound between two backdirt piles
(Figure 27). This location seemed relatively undisturbed
and excavation in 10 cm levels was begun. The matrix
was a very dark brown color and extremely dense (with
clay) so that water screening became necessary beginning with level 2. The matrix of 0-10 cm through 60-70
cm levels was screened through ¼ inch mesh to reduce
the volume by about 75 percent. To save field time the
hard-to-screen residue was bagged for later off-site water
screening through 1/16 inch mesh. Levels 8 to 10 (70100 cm) were water screened entirely through 1/16 inch
mesh. As excavating commenced it became apparent
that the northwest quarter of the area being excavated
was disturbed by either an animal burrow or a rotted
tree stump now filled with loose sediment. Being unwilling to disturb more of the site than was necessary in
exploratory work, the test pit was continued: it finally
penetrated through the base of the mound deposit at a
depth of 1 m with signs of disturbance absent below 50
cm. Sterile grayish brown clay was reached at about
100 cm depth (Table 26). No internal mound layering
or stratification was visually evident in the undisturbed
sidewalls of the test pit.
Artifacts were relatively abundant and those recovered from the test pit are listed and discussed later.
Other materials recovered were animal bone fragments,
the brackish water clam Rangia cuneata, unidentifiable freshwater mussel shell fragments, terrestrial gastropods, carbonate concretions, and baked clay lumps.
The first three classes were very likely subsistence re-

80

mains while most of the concretions may have formed
in situ within the mound. The animal bones were all
small pieces; bones of large mammals such as deer were
shattered into small fragments. Because of the evaluative nature of the work a faunal analyst was not engaged to identify such a small collection of subsistence
materials, but they included deer (predominantly), turtles,
small rodents, snakes, crabs, birds, small amounts of
the brackish water clam Rangia cuneata, freshwater
and estuarine mussels, and fish (including gar).
The mound matrix was very dark brown with decayed organic material, and was reminiscent of the
dense, clayey Beaumont Formation underlying the
mound. The mound material was very rich in calcium
carbonate that was leached from the sediment, carried
downward by groundwater and typically precipitated
on other objects in the lower levels: bones, shells, and
lithics in particular, all became encrusted with carbonate. There also was a lot of fire used at this mound,
possibly accounting for much of the extremely dark
color of the matrix. Most bones, shells, concretions,
and other objects have been burned to some degree.
Instead of counting concretions and fragmented
bones and shells from Test Pit 1, they were weighed to
gain some idea of their distribution through the thickness of the mound (Figure 28). Certain patterns stand
out in the plot of these weights. First, the lower 20 cm
of the test pit has a very large and rising (with depth)
amount of calcium carbonate concretions and very little
of anything else, including artifacts, suggesting these
levels may be discolored by decayed organic material
from above, but are really below the base of the mound.
The abundance of material, including artifacts, in the
10 to 40 cm depth evidently is the level where the majority of the midden zone and the late burials were deposited. The 40 to 80 cm depth may have been the
level at which the early burials were placed. Midden
debris is not absent at this depth, but is much diminished from its abundance higher in the mound, at least
as it appears where penetrated by Test Pit 1.
The last excavation undertaken in 2003 was backhoe Trench #1 for the purpose of recording a stratigraphic profile to place the mound structure better into
its local setting (Figure 29). It was clear by this time
that Test Pit 1 and the bucket auger retrieval were not
sufficiently extensive exposures from which to observe
and document strata in the dark, low contrast sediment.
And so a location for a profile trench was selected on
the southwest side of the site beginning at what was

thought to be the edge of the mound and extending
radially away from it. The trench orientation also was
partly dictated by the accessibility afforded by trees
and shrubs on the site. The trench extended for 25 feet
(7.6 m) and ranged from 3 to 5 feet (about 1 to 1.5 m)
in depth, stopping when the yellowish brown sandy
clay of the Beaumont Formation was reached.
Some of the stratification in the north wall of the
trench was selected for examination because there was
better light on this exposure. Despite this the strata were
difficult to interpret. Heavy reliance was placed on slight
color differences, sediment cohesiveness, and varying
clay content. Boundaries seldom were sharp thanks to
extensive bioturbation from sources ranging from worms
to foxes to root systems. A number of sediment samples
were taken for later visual and microscopic examination and these descriptions are included in Table 26. If
investigation is conducted at this site in the future it will
be essential to provide for more detailed sedimentological and micromorphological study to confirm the existence and nature of the sediment layers discussed below
(see Figures 29 and 30; Table 26).
RADIOCARBON SAMPLES
An attempt was made to obtain radiocarbon dates
from the 50 to 80 cm level of Test Pit 1 (Figure 28).
This was believed to date the initial midden and mortuary phase of Black Hill. The first sample was Rangia
cuneata clam shell and the second was fragments of
long bone from a large mammal, probably deer. C14
sample #1, the shell sample (Beta 188916), was measured by conventional radiometric counting. Much of
C14 sample #2, the bone sample (Beta 195492), had
been burned destroying a lot of the bone collagen and
this sample was run using the accelerator mass spectrometry technique. Both were run by Beta Analytic,
Inc. and the sample details were given previously in
Table 4.
These samples were expected to produce calibrated
dates somewhere around 2000 to 2500 years ago given
the Tchefuncte culture association of ceramic artifacts
that were excavated (cf. Clear Lake Period dates in
Ensor 1998:461 ff; and a Sabine Lake Area early ceramic date in Aten and Bollich 2002:20). Instead, the
two new calibrated samples measured some 5 to 6 thousand years ago, much older than was anticipated.
Further, the two sample dates were in their correct chronological sequence according to their depth in

the site; that is to say, the older date came from a greater
depth than the younger date. It appears that the lowest
cultural deposit at Black Hill in fact dates to the Middle
Archaic. This actually is consistent with several of the
dart points (Gary, Kent, Williams, Woden) recovered
both from Test Pit 1 and from the middle 1960’s work;
these types could be found in archeological assemblages
from the Middle through Late Archaic periods.
MOUND FORMATION
The apparent “big picture” of how Black Hill

mound was formed largely can be seen in the Trench
#1 profile (Figure 29). The sediments of the mound
(Zone 2) appear to rest on the underlying more or less
horizontal surface of the Beaumont Formation (Zone
1) 2 to 3 feet (approximately 1 m) below the present
ground surface. Since then the mound has been partially buried by the Zone 3 sediments. And finally, the
mound was mantled by remnants of backdirt (Zone 4)
from previous excavations. An elaboration of this depositional history (Figure 30) is supported by sediment
samples taken from Trench #1 and from other locations (Table 26).

Figure 30 for interpretation of depositional history.

The Pleistocene
The bedrock geological formation underlying the
coastal prairies of Jefferson County is the Pleistocene
Beaumont Formation. The various sedimentary facies
of this formation originated as backswamps, distributary river channels and levees, interdistributary basins,
and deltaic deposits of the Pleistocene Trinity River
and its successive meanderbelt locations created as the
river shifted location across its deltaic plain. The Black
Hill locality is in what once was an interdistributary
basin, a topographically low area between the Pleistocene China Ridge and the earlier Neches Ridge
meanderbelts of the Trinity River (Aronow 1971:Figure 22). As a result, the Beaumont Formation sediments near Black Hill are primarily clay with subordinate amounts of very fine sand and silt.
During the following late glacial low sea level periods, this Trinity River deltaic plain surface was exposed as dry land for thousands of years during which
the sediments were oxidized to substantial depths. This

is the origin of the yellowish brown sandy clays sampled
underneath the mound and in the bottom of Trench #1
as Zone 1A (also see Table 26). The reason for abundant and large white carbonate concretions being found
in the Beaumont Formation under the mound but not
immediately beyond the mound is unknown. Intermittent deposits of such concretions in the Beaumont are
fairly common and Prof. Aronow was of the opinion
that their occurrence under the mound was coincidental (Aronow 1997).
Over the millennia that the Beaumont Formation
deltaic plain was subaerially exposed, soil began to form
at its surface. This paleosol development probably is
what is reflected in the sandy silty clay that is similar to
the underlying Zone 1A samples but is extensively discolored with dark grayish brown mottles and also with
a much more common occurrence of small iron/manganese nodules. This apparent paleosol is documented
as Zone 1B in Trench #1 and in the bottom of Test Pit
1 (Table 26; Figures 29, 30, and 31). A similar paleosol
feature was documented underneath the nearby

Gaulding site (Aten and Bollich 2002:15). Both paleosol
occurrences recorded in the Taylor Bayou drainage basin probably are equivalent to the Wallisville Paleosol
described on Trinity River terraces (Nordt et al.
1998:36). In any event, Zone 1B was the ground surface for an extended time period and the archeological
mound was established on it.

venience from which originated the early ceramic collection obtained in 1963-65 by Professor Long and given
to Dr. Bollich. Then, another burial that may have included three individuals—one adult and possibly two
infants—was found in the upper part of Zone 2B or
possibly 2C. At this shallow depth it seems a likely
possibility that this late burial postdates the formation
and use of the mound.
At the top of the midden zone in Trench #1 and
Test Pit 1 was another layer—Zone 2C—some 4 inches
(10 cm) thick that may or may not be part of the mound
(Figures 29 and 30). The sediment is similar to that
below except it is significantly depleted of clay; also
there were fewer artifacts and less indication of midden
debris. Tentatively this zone is interpreted as the weathered mound surface. Together these three units comprise Zone 2, the Black Hill Mound.

The archeological mound
The mound deposit, wherever found, is distinguished by its stiff, clayey texture and black color—
actually an extremely dark brown (Table 26). The
mound’s buried margin was readily observable in the
north end of Trench #1 (Figure 29) and in Test Pit 1
until Zone 1B was reached in the bottom (90-100 cm)
level. Documenting any internal differentiation within
the mound will require a more quantitative sediment
analysis than was possible here. There are, however,
indications of at least two construction levels.
The earliest apparent mound component—the
Middle Archaic midden—was recognized in Trench #1
as a very dark grayish brown sandy clay labeled Zone
2A (Table 26; Figures 29 and 30). This zone was noticeably more clayey and stiff than overlying sediments;
there also was little midden debris evident. On the opposite side of the mound, at Test Pit 1, the matrix was
more silty (Table 26) and some midden debris was
present although much less was recorded between 40
and 70 cm depth than was found nearer the top of the
test pit (Figure 28). This is the zone that was radiocarbon dated to roughly 5 to 6 thousand calibrated years
ago. It was probably this zone in which there were five
burials found interred within the lower 6 inches (15
cm) of the mound deposit (C.N. Bollich, 1965 field
notes; Figure 27).
Above Zone 2A in the Trench #1 profile there
was noticeably less clay and noticeably more midden
debris including small fragments of bone, shell, and
sherds (Figure 29). At the corresponding 10 to 40 cm
levels in Test Pit 1 there was even less clay, although
the matrix consistency still was dense. Small bone fragments were abundant and usually were burned, and
artifacts were more frequent than in any other level.
This level, about 20-30 cm thick seems unequivocally
midden in nature, and was designated Zone 2B. The
greater abundance and early ceramic nature of the artifacts excavated from the upper part of Test Pit 1 suggests this midden layer (Zone 2B) is the principal pro-

Holocene sediment transport
The present ground surface away from the mound
is not the surface upon which deposition of the mound
was originally begun. For some 6,000 years sediment
has been piling up around the base of the mound to a
depth of 2 or 3 feet (1 m or less) to ultimately engulf
about half of its elevation (Figures 29 and 30). This
stratigraphic unit, labeled Zone 3, lies unconformably
on Zones 1B and 2B. It resembles the middle to late
Holocene Eagleridge Unit at the Eagle’s Ridge site on
the lower Trinity River (Nordt et al. 1998:36–37), and
similar unnamed units at the nearby Gaulding site (Aten
and Bollich 2002:Figure 5) and the Harris County Boys
School site near Clear Lake south of Houston (Aten et
al. 1976:Figure 3).
The sedimentary characteristics of Zone 3 are very
reminiscent of Zone 1B, the Beaumont Formation
paleosol, except that Zone 3 is significantly depleted of
clay. Apparently over several thousand years—at least
since the middle Holocene and perhaps earlier—sediment from the surface of the Beaumont Formation on
higher elevations of the interfluve between Hillebrandt
Bayou and Willow Marsh Bayou has been transported
slowly downslope toward the local drainages. In the
process much, but not all, of the clay fraction was lost
and the remaining coarser fractions were redeposited
on the Beaumont Formation surface closer to the bayous and, in the case of Black Hill, were piled up behind
the mound. A similar “piling up” occurred at the landward side of the Gaulding site. This sediment transport

process may or may not account for the minor topographic “ripples” on the ground surface peripheral to
the mound (Figure 27). The slight ridges may reflect
periods of perhaps moister climate when sediment was
transported downslope and piled up more rapidly while
the intervening shallow swales may reflect dry intervals
when sediment transported more slowly. This is only
speculation but it seems likely the ripples have nothing
to do with formation of the archeological mound. It is
possible some of Zone 3 was contributed by overbank
flooding in the upper Hillebrandt Bayou drainage basin
but more detailed sediment and soils analysis will be
required to carry this discussion further.

Modern digging
Finally, at the very top of the mound profile in
Trench #1 is a loose deposit (Zone 4) that appears to
be the remnant of backdirt from the treasure and other
pits dug into the mound’s center and thrown out to the
sides (Figure 29).
A summary of the mound’s structure and formation is given in schematic form in Figure 31 but a remaining question about the mound’s formation is from
where did the very dark brown mound sediment originate? Numerous people, both in 1963-1965 and in 2003
walked a considerable area around the mound and rec-

ognized no surface evidence of other archeological
middens or mounds nearby. The 2003 topographic survey extending some 100 feet (30 m) out from the
mound’s periphery gave no indication of a borrow pit
location. Indeed, any borrow pit, whether from the
Beaumont Formation ground surface or from a midden
site on it probably has been buried under some 2 feet
(60 cm) of eroded and transported sediment.
While sediment in the mound samples is similar
to that in the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation samples,
some of the clay has been lost and a great deal of decayed organic material has been introduced sufficient
to totally change the color and modify the texture. If
Black Hill is a built mound, the most likely source of fill
would have been Zone 1B, the paleosol on the surface
of the Beaumont Formation where clay had begun to
be removed and humic organic materials had begun to
accumulate. Where the remainder of this transformation took place is not known but there is a great deal of
evidence of fire at the mound in the form of abundant
burned bones, burned shells, and burned lithic flakes.
Also, reminiscent of the Beaumont Formation as the
source of mound sediment, is that the latter contains
much calcium carbonate which dissolved into groundwater and was redeposited as carbonate crusts on artifacts, bones, lithics, shells and just about any solid object. If future investigation verifies that the Zone 2A
layer is relatively midden-free, other sources possibly
such as organic mud from the bayou channel should be
investigated. For now, though, this is a question that
cannot be answered.

irregular center area of the mound. All in all, the content of the 1963-1965 and 2003 ceramic collections is
remarkably similar (Table 27). Also see Table 28 for
tabulation of ceramic vessel form attributes; these are
discussed later with vessel form information from all
the sites in this present study. Readers usually will have
to consult Tables 27 and 29 to identify which artifact
data comes from the Long collection and the Heartfield
report, and which is from the 2003 test pit.
Although the collections from 1963-1965 were
catalogued with site and lot numbers, it is our understanding that the latter designate collectors and dates
collected rather than intra-site proveniences. For this
reason the Long ceramics collection was treated as a
single, undifferentiated collection. To facilitate use of
the Heartfield (n.d.) report it was necessary to number
each artifact in the order it was described, and these
surrogate lot numbers are used to identify artifacts in
tables and in descriptions that follow. Artifacts from the
2003 test pit excavation were catalogued with conventional lot numbers indicating their provenience. At least
some of the 1963-1965 artifacts were retrieved as a
result of sifting mound matrix through screens of unknown mesh, and all of the 2003 test pit material was
water-screened through ¼ inch and 1/16 inch mesh.
Thus many artifact classes from the mound probably
are well represented. Weakness in the 1960’s era collections is most likely to be in lithic debris and subsistence faunal remains of small animals.
As is being done in the presentation of all collections, descriptions of ceramics and projectile points are
consolidated in Appendixes A and B respectively to avoid
repetition of narrative and to take advantage of the larger
numbers of specimens thus available. All other artifacts
from Black Hill are described in this chapter. In particular it should be noted that the photographs, pen and
ink drawings, descriptions and measurements from the
student report (Heartfield n.d.) are used for updating
and incorporation with other early ceramic information
even though the 1963-65 specimens are not available
to be re-examined. The classifications often are tentative or have been changed for this study, and descriptions based on Heartfield (n.d.) are brief but result in a
more complete picture of the artifact assemblage from
the mound.

ARTIFACTS
It was noted above that artifacts examined from
the Black Hill Mound came from two sources: a moderate sized collection of ceramics made in the 1960s
given to C. N. Bollich by Dr. Russell Long of Beaumont; and a small collection excavated by Aten and
Bollich under a state Antiquities Permit from a 1 m2 test
pit dug in 2003. In addition, we are exceedingly fortunate to have available a manuscript report written as an
undergraduate class project around 1965 and generously made available by Lorraine Heartfield Greene
(Heartfield n.d.) covering the majority of non-ceramic
artifacts recovered from the central pit (Figure 25).
Those artifacts were returned to the collectors in the
1960s and have not been examined since. Together these
sources cover the majority of artifacts dug out of the

to Dr. Bollich may be the majority of ceramics excavated out of the center area of the mound although
some decorated sherds may be missing. Despite this,
collections from sites in the Sabine rarely have more
than 5 percent decorated sherds and this collection has
3 percent suggesting that not much is amiss.
All of the ceramic types and varieties in this collection (Tables 27, 41, and 42) are well known in the
Sabine Lake and southeast Texas area except for the
incised and red-filmed varieties of the sand-tempered
O’Neal paste. Because these treatments are typical of
other early ceramic pastes (e.g., Tchefuncte and Goose
Creek) their appearance is not a surprise and we have

given them names despite their limited abundance:
Conway Red-filmed, variety Conway and Conway Incised, variety Cove. Neither is the presence of the two
grog-tempered (clay and sandy paste) categories unexpected as they have long been known to occur much
earlier in the Sabine than in the Galveston Bay Area
just a short distance west (see Figure 4, this study; also
Aten 1983:282; Aten and Bollich 1969). The ceramic
frequencies from both the 1963-1965 and the 2003 collections are similar (Table 27) and they have been combined for purposes of analysis.
The ceramics from Black Hill are similar to other
early ceramic assemblages with Tchefuncte culture af-

finities in the northern Gulf coast region described in
this investigation. The relatively large proportions of
Tchefuncte Plain, variety Mandeville and O’Neal Plain,
variety Conway in relation to Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte, and the small proportions of both
Baytown Plain varieties indicate this assemblage is a
late Orange Period assemblage in the Sabine (Figures 4
and 5).

recovered from Black Hill were typical of the early
ceramic time period: predominantly Gary and Kent
forms, weak on other Archaic forms, and had a minor
presence of early arrow points (see Table 29 for frequency distributions of non-ceramics; also see Appendix B for information on all projectile points).

Lithics

Drill/perforators. Three forms of these common
tools were recovered: hand-held, bipointed, and small
elongate. Basically, these are flakes bifacially chipped
into narrow elongate tools (see Figure 32, A; Tables 29
and 30). The hand-held form has a thick bit with an
enlarged proximal end to facilitate gripping the tool. The
bipointed form also has a thick bit but the proximal end
is not enlarged. The small elongate form is reminiscent
of microflints. Objects of these shapes are common in
sites throughout southeast Texas. Ordinarily they have
been called drills or perforators and some do display
such wear patterns. Also see the discussion of these
tool forms in Chapter 3.
Side chopping tool. This is a polished, rectangular
slab of silicified wood with one of the long sides bifacially flaked and now battered from apparent use as a

Projectile points
Compared to the interior of the coastal plain, where
there is greater availability of lithic resource materials
and thus a greater abundance of chipped stone tools,
lithics are relatively scarce near the coast. Where possible, the classification used here is based not just on
artifacts from Black Hill, but on artifacts from all the
early ceramic site collections from the Sabine Lake Area
currently under study. As noted above, by pooling all
those collections it is possible to obtain a larger sample,
a better sense of the overall technological picture in the
area, and avoid extended repetitive narrative.
Like the ceramics, most of the projectile points

chopping tool (Figure 32, D; Tables 29 and 30). It appears to be an example of a very common east Texas
biface form known as a Harvey knife or biface (Jelks
1965:163).
Large beaked chopping tool. This is an elongate
and relatively large piece of silicified wood with the
distal end bifacially chipped into an apparent chopping
or cutting tool; the opposite, proximal, end is relatively
blunt (Figure 32, E–E’; Tables 29 and 30).
Spokeshaves. Two long, narrow flake fragments
each have had two concave notches chipped into one
of their long sides (Figure 32, C; Tables 29 and 30).
Specimen 31 is definitely bifacially notched while the
other (number 30) may only be unifacially notched,
but is not available for examination.
Biface tools broken either in use or preparation
Projectile point/knife failure. At least three bifacially worked tool fragments were recovered that had
failed during flaking when being made, or broke during
use (see Tables 29 and 30). These apparently were
intended to be tools with broad blades such as projectile points or knives.
Drill/perforator, hand-held. The proximal ends of
two examples of this form of drill/perforator were included in the 1960’s collections.

source material is common in Late Prehistoric sites of
the southeast Texas coast when the chipped stone tools
often were small and frequently made as biface core
tools.
Unmodified flakes. Some 23 flakes, many with
some cortex remaining were recovered in 1963-65 although material and flake type was not recorded for
most of the specimens. A larger collection was recovered by water-screening Test Pit 1 in 2003. Both collections indicate that chert was far and away the material of choice for chipped stone tools. Interestingly, these
proportions (see Tables 29, 30 and 31) are remarkably
similar to proportions previously reported for Late Prehistoric sites in both the Sabine and the lower Trinity
River areas (Aten 1983:301). In addition, the flake types
include progressively increasing proportions of primary
cortex, secondary cortex, and then most of all, interior
thinning flakes. Taken together with the presence of
numerous lithic resource pebbles (see above) indicates
that it was common for the manufacture and resharpening
of chipped stone tools to be going on at Black Hill.
Many of the lithic flakes had ended up in, or very close
to, fires as indicated by potlid scars, circular fractures,
and a reddish color. Heat treating probably was in use
here as well since some flakes and chipped tools have
red colors and lustrous sheen on otherwise undamaged
flake scars.
Bone artifacts

Uniface tools
Used flakes. Seven flakes were recovered that
were described as flaked to a minimal degree. The available descriptions leave the nature unclear but they all
appear to be convenience tools whose sharp edge was
used for cutting until the edges were flaked away from
use (Tables 29 and 30).
End scrapers. These are two plano-convex flakes
with chipping around the bulbar end (see Figure 32, B;
and Tables 29 and 30).
Debris from lithic tool manufacture
Inspected resource pebbles (Table 29). Seven chert
and quartzite resource pebbles were recovered with each
having at least one inspection flake removed. One possible source of these pebbles is from the stomach of
alligators hunted as food. Since the pebble dimensions
were not reported they cannot be compared to size
data on gastroliths (Aten 1983:344) but such lithic re-

All of the bone artifacts described below were
recovered in 1963-65 and were described in Heartfield’s
report (n.d.); none were found during the 2003 work.
Awls
Awl, long metapodial. Three complete or very
nearly complete long shaft awls, as well as five fragments were recovered from near one of the burials but
were not reported as definitely associated (Heartfield
n.d.). The two complete specimens were 240 mm and
228 mm in length; the third specimen was 185 mm
long not counting the missing distal tip. All three were
made from deer metapodials (see Figure 33, E; and
Table 29). The presence of complete examples of such
an easily broken and scattered artifact tends to support
the burial association. The function of such long-handled
awls is hard to pinpoint; weaving, netting, perforating,
or perhaps even to dispatch medium sized animals be-

ing hunted, or perhaps all of the above come to mind.
If the artifacts can be examined someday, perhaps wear
markings will suggest how these tools were used.
Splinter awls, hand-held. Some 22 mostly bone
splinters with an end shaped and sharpened into awl
functionality, were recovered (see Figure 33, A–D; Table
29). The longest of these was 128 mm. A few of these
specimens probably were the distal tips of more refined
tools such as the long awls or socketed bone points, but
these tips were still long and sharp enough to be used.

Convenience tools
Hammer(?), antler. This artifact was described as
a large section of branching antler tine worn smooth by
use that was presumed to be hammering (Table 29).
Flaking tools(?), antler. Numerous fragments of
antler were recovered including some 27 tines that were
presumed to show wear from use as a lithic flaking tool
(Table 29).

Ornamental objects

Unidentifiable fragments

Tubular bead, incised. A single bead was recovered bearing three pairs of incised lines around the circumference (see Figure 33, F–F’ and Table 29). Made
from a relatively large bird, this bead was not associated with any of the burials.
Baculum pendants. Two complete and six fragments of raccoon penis bone were cut on the proximal
end and ground flat on the distal end and presumably
used for some manner of adornment, a common use,
or assumption at least, throughout the southeastern U.S.
It is possible they are used instead for some utilitarian
purpose, though. They were not reported as associated
with a burial at Black Hill (see Figure 32, G–H).

Shaft fragments, unidentified tools. Some 17
smoothed and shaped proximal and medial shaft fragments of unidentifiable bone tools were recovered (Table
29).

Other tools
Fishhook, carved bone. This curious artifact was
originally reported as a claw-shaped pendant fashioned
from large mammal bone (see Figure 33, I and Table
29). It was described as having a single perforation in
the proximal end indicating it had been a pendant or
was otherwise attached to a garment, mask, or the like.
There are other probabilities, such as a fishhook—the
conclusion drawn here—but the artifact has to be examined further to improve on the original description
(Heartfield n.d.).

Shell artifacts
Tools
Scoop, mussel shell. Recovered in the 2003 test
pit, this artifact is cut from either the anterior or posterior end of a thin freshwater mussel shell (Figure 32,
F–F’; Table 29). The cut edges are ground smooth and
the implement is 49 mm long and 43 mm wide. Its
curved shape is suggestive of a scoop or spoon and
brings to mind a group of scoop-like artifacts found in
southeast Texas: one made of bone from the lower Trinity River (Aten 1983:Figure 13.3n) and several made
from freshwater mussel but quite different in form from
the Eddleman site, 41OR49 (Chapter 3, this report).
Ornamental objects
Beads, tubular columella; Beads, disc. Two tubular and hundreds of disc beads were recovered in 196365 in two groups apparently placed with burials

(Heartfield n.d.). In 2003 two additional disc beads were
found in the Test Pit 1 midden excavation. Because of
these contextual differences the three groups are described separately according to their associations, but
are included in Table 29 according to their individual
forms.
The tubular beads are obviously made from the
columella of a conch, probably Busycon sp. The 196365 disc beads were described originally as made from
columellae also, but examination of the two new specimens from the 2003 excavations indicates that these
two, at least, were made from the outer whorl of a
conch, or perhaps even from a bivalve shell. Nearly all
the disc beads from Black Hill were quite thin, ranging
from about 1 to 2.5 mm. They varied more in their
diameter—from 8 to 24 mm—although the vast majority was in the 8 to 13 mm range. The diameter of the
central hole drilled through the shell disc ranges from
2.5 to 5.4 mm although the very large diameter discs
(circa 24 mm) had large diameter central holes of 1213 mm.
Group 1 (1963-65). As described by Heartfield
(n.d.), this group was associated with a burial and consisted of two tubular beads and three disc beads. The
two tubular bead specimens were made from a columella and were 31 and 42 mm long and a maximum
of 13 and 15 mm in diameter; the central hole was 8 to
8.7 mm in diameter (Figure 32, M–N). Two of the disc
beads were 2 mm thick, 11 and 12.5 mm in diameter,
and the central hole was 4 to 4.5 mm in diameter (Figure 32, H–L). The third bead is unusually thick—8
mm, and 13 mm in diameter, with a central hole 6 mm
in diameter.
Group 2 (1963-1965). This group, also associated with a burial, contained two different disc bead
shapes. First was a set of 11 beads 1 to 2.5 mm in
thickness and 23 to 24 mm in diameter; the central hole
was 12 to 13 mm in diameter (Figure 32, L). The other
set was described as 228 beads 1 to 2.3 mm in thickness, 8.5 to 9 mm in diameter, and with a small central
hole 4 to 4.5 mm in diameter identical to those shown
in Figure 32, H–I.
Test Pit 1 (2003 excavation). Two disc beads were
found in the excavation of Test Pit 1 and were not
associated with any burial. These were nearly identical
specimens (Figure 32, H–I): 8.2 and 8.3 mm diameter,
both 2.6 mm in thickness, and with a central hole 2.5
to 5.4 mm in diameter. They were identical essentially
to the most numerous form in Group 2 (above). Both

specimens had been strongly discolored to a dark gray
color apparently by proximity to fire. Because of this it
could not be determined with certainty if they had been
made from a columella or from the outer whorl but the
latter seems more likely.
Notched freshwater mussel valve. One fragmented, notched or serrated, mussel shell and two whole
shells were recovered at Black Hill in the 1963-65 excavations, reportedly from one of the burials (Figure
32, G; Table 29). The V-shaped notches are about 1
mm deep, 1.5 mm apart, and extend all around the
ventral shell margin. The notches on two of the specimens were worn down and not easily visible on photographs (Heartfield n.d.). Similar polished, whole, freshwater mussel valves, apparently not notched, were
found with at least two burials from the Mitchell Ridge
site on Galveston Island (Ricklis 1994:254–255; 274–
277).
Estuarine/marine shells
Dinocardium fragments. Small numbers of fragments of this distinctive surf clam (the Giant Atlantic
Cockle) are commonly found at northern Gulf of Mexico
sites and fragments were recovered from both the 196365 and the 2003 excavations at Black Hill (Table 29).
They are found in small numbers and are unlikely to be
a subsistence residue like the Rangia cuneata.
Dinocardium shells are almost never shaped in any
obvious way into a functionality or item of ornamentation, but they are often present in fragmented form at
sites some distance from the coast as, for example, at
other sites in the present study. Clearly these shells had
some significance that occasioned their being brought
all the way from the Gulf beaches. The single example
of actual Dinocardium use that comes to mind is the
whole Dinocardium valve placed over a set of nested
Dosinia shells resting over the mid-thigh of a burial at
the Jamaica Beach site on Galveston Island (Ring
1963:4). One has to wonder if the significance of
Dinocardium shell was in the whole valve itself and
that part of its function in local culture involved smashing one on particular occasions.
Busycon fragments. In 1963-65, a columella and
the spire of a Busycon sp. were recovered; in 2003 an
additional columella fragment was found (Table 29).
The spire had been cut from the whorls and columella
but no other modification had been done and the spire
evidently was discarded. The two columellae were

98

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

poorly preserved and no tool marks, drilled holes or
distinctive shaping were evident.
Other utilitarian artifacts
Sandstone fragments. Recovered in 1963-65, one
piece of white sandstone (43 × 13 × 10 mm) is vaguely
shaped like a projectile point or preform although it
could not have actually functioned that way. In 2003,
from Test Pit 1, a well-cemented, coarse-grained, ferruginous sandstone piece was recovered (Table 29).
This fragment is small (17 × 20 × 27 mm) but one side
has been smoothed and shaped leaving open various
functional possibilities; it may have been an abrader, a
pitted stone, or a small grinding stone, all of which items
are occasionally found in area sites.
Pigment stones. In 1963-65, two rocks described
as ferruginous sandstone and a hematite nodule were
found (Table 29). Both were soft and contained abundant red-orange ochre or other iron mineral.
Asphalt. A single piece of asphalt was recovered
from the 1960’s excavation (Table 29). No other information is available.
Other non-utilitarian artifacts
Slate pendant. Recovered in 1963-65, this thin
fragment of gray slate looks as if it might originally
have been a bar gorget that was broken and one end of
it was retained (Table 29; Figure 33, J–J’). One surface of the piece was described as polished while the
opposite side remained rough and unfinished (Heartfield
n.d.).

east Texas generally do not include expanding stem types
like Scallorn. At Black Hill, there were only two arrow
points, a Perdiz and an unnamed straight-stemmed form.
Dart points at this site were dominated by varieties of
Kent and Gary types which seem to be typical of early
ceramic sites in this area. Other types include typical
Late Archaic forms and some rather odd forms that
appear to be reworked from large Early and Middle
Archaic points found in the area. These appear to have
been used essentially as preforms to be shaped into an
approximation of Late Archaic or early ceramic types—
in this case, Yarbrough.
The remainder of the tool assemblage is of a routine, domestic nature and includes the ever-present suite
of different drill/perforator forms, flake convenience
tools, choppers, scrapers, sandstone abraders, bone awls
of various kinds, a shell scoop/spoon, and so on.
The only non-burial associated “special” artifacts
include several pendant types: slate, possibly recovered
from a broken bar gorget; an incised tubular bone bead;
and several baculum pendants. In addition there were
several fragments of Dinocardium shells; these are often found fragmented in coastal southeast Texas sites
but in insufficient quantity to be a subsistence item and
are suspected of being used (i.e., smashed) in a ritual
context.
While documentation of artifacts accompanying
the burials is sparse, notched freshwater mussel valves,
quantities of shell disc beads (and a couple of tubular
columella beads), and some very long deer cannon bone
pointed tools apparently were grave goods. Whether
these pointed bone tools were supposed to be awls or
served some other function was not able to be determined.

Artifact summary
CONCLUSIONS
The ceramic collections from Black Hill are convincingly early and have affiliations with the Tchefuncte
culture of south Louisiana. These types include
Tchefuncte Plain (both Tchefuncte and Mandeville varieties), Tchefuncte Stamped variety Tchefuncte, a large
proportion of O’Neal Plain variety Conway, and Goose
Creek Plain variety Anahuac. Other types and varieties, both common and rare, but of less chronological
distinction were present (Table 27).
Early arrow points in the Sabine appear to be primarily straight stemmed types, like Alba, and contracting stem types, especially Perdiz. Unlike west of
Galveston Bay the early arrow points of extreme south-

As a result of digging by local collectors, Black
Hill Mound (41JF24) has long been known as an archeological site with human burials. It also has abundant ceramics indicative of affiliation or at least
contemporaneity with the Tchefuncte culture(s) of south
Louisiana. A large collection of potsherds from the site
had been turned over to Dr. Bollich for study and
curation, and a student paper on non-ceramics prepared
some 40 years ago was made available for review and
use here (Heartfield n.d.). Analysis of these artifacts
and records provided convincing evidence that the site
was attributable to the early ceramic culture of the

Chapter 5: Reconnaissance at Black Hill Mound (41JF24)

99

Sabine.
The question remained, however, whether Black
Hill was a stratified midden accumulation, a midden in
a pimple mound, or a built mound of a ceremonial nature. Review of the site area’s geology, geomorphology, and soils gave no indication of pimple mound fields.
At the same time, descriptions of small Tchefuncteaffiliated mortuary mounds some 130 miles (209 km)
east near Lafayette, Louisiana (Ford and Quimby
1945:21–24; Gibson 1976:45–46) seemed intriguingly
similar to what little was known about Black Hill. If
Black Hill was a constructed mound, the implications
of this would be significant for understanding the complexity of early ceramic native culture in the Sabine. It
seemed there was no alternative but to return to the site
and attempt to learn more about its structure and formation. The following major field objectives were substantially accomplished.
Extended surface mapping indicates that no more
than approximately 40 percent of the spatial extent of
the original mound may still remain, although these in
situ remains are all on the mound periphery thereby
lacking the thickness of deposit once present in the center, and this periphery is even further degraded by the
animal burrows and rotted tree stumps prevalent over
the whole site.
The combination of mapping, limited testing, and
a profile trench conveys a reasonably clear picture of
Black Hill as a small, discrete mound founded on the
original Pleistocene Beaumont Formation and now partially buried by reworked Beaumont Formation sediments transported downslope toward the old Hillebrandt
Bayou channel (Figure 31). No unequivocal indication
was discovered of visible internal mound structural differentiation such as layering or pits, although sediment
characteristics suggest there are two mound layers—a
midden layer below into which several burials had been
interred, and another such layer above—each about 40
cm thick.
Radiocarbon dates from other investigations of
early ceramic contexts in the lower Trinity River, the
Eagle’s Ridge site, and Sabine River all provide an expectation that the Black Hill site would date in the range
of 2100 to 2300 years BP. However, samples of Rangia
cuneata shells and of animal bone from the lower layer
of Test Pit 1 were submitted for radiocarbon dating
(see Chapter 2) and yielded results of 5340 to 6200
calibrated years before present—impossibly old dates
for a Tchefuncte culture association. Since both radio-

carbon samples from Test Pit 1 produced
stratigraphically consistent as well as similar results (Figure 28) the incorporation of Early to Middle Archaic
deposits in the initial formation of the mound now has
to be considered. While the sediment in the lower part
of the mound was very dark colored and dense with
domestic midden debris, the only diagnostic artifacts
from the collection that approximate that age were a
San Patrice point and a couple of dart points possibly
reworked from early Bell or Calf Creek-like points.
Perhaps this mound originated as an early midden or
the mound may have been built up from early midden
fill brought from a nearby and now buried Archaic site.
This is a question that cannot be answered at present
and would need careful attention if any new field work
was planned.
No evidence was seen of an off-mound midden
or of a borrow pit in the immediate (i.e., 100 feet or 30
m) vicinity of Black Hill. Such a source of the fill used
to construct this mound, however, is likely to be buried
at a depth of 2 to 3 feet (±1 m) and be dug into the
Beaumont Formation paleosol. If so, it will be difficult
to find.
To pursue the many uncertainties about Black Hill
Mound would require a major excavation at some future time. But it seems reasonable to conclude that the
site retains research value to address the issues described
below especially if further random digging can be prevented. For now, as indicated above, the evidence in
hand from all previous work at Black Hill points suggestively toward the mound being built and used in the
following separate stages.
1. A low mound was built either as an Early or Middle
Archaic midden site, or as a platform built of Early/
Middle Archaic midden fill—probably the former.
2. Five human burials were placed in the early platform; the age of these burials could be any time
between building the first platform and the early
ceramic.
3. A second mound level of early ceramic age was
built up either as an in situ habitation site or as
early ceramic fill piled up at this location.
4. In this later platform, probably after it was no longer
in use, an additional interment of an adult female
and one or two infants was placed at some subsequent time.
This seems to be the case given the apparent two

100

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

layers of habitation debris and artifacts in Test Pit 1
(Figure 28) and the ability to recognize Zone 2a (probably the first mortuary zone) and Zone 2b (the overlying habitation zone and subsequent mortuary zone) in
the Trench #1 profile based on slight differences in debris content and lithology (Figure 29). While interpreting this mound history is somewhat speculative at this
stage, the distinct mound boundary, circular mound plan,
and placement of mortuary behavior leads to the preliminary conclusion that Black Hill does not appear to
be simply a midden mound. Except for the prospect
that future sediment studies may confirm the two stratified levels, the characteristics of Black Hill are generally similar to those reported for the Tchefuncte culture
Lafayette mounds and other locations in south Louisiana (Ford and Quimby 1945:21–24; Gibson 1976:45–
46, 1996:47–49). The fact that the Lafayette Mounds
contained many more interments is not necessarily a
contrary factor.
The range of artifacts and subsistence fauna from
Test Pit 1 indicates the upper level at Black Hill was
used for general habitation but the apparent spatial congruence of the much younger upper level with the much
older lower level suggests this habitation occurred because the mortuary location was known to be there and
was not just a coincidental selection of a place to camp
from time to time. Because of the two mortuary contexts Black Hill, even if it was a habitation site, is unquestionably a ceremonial mound too—possibly what
has been called a “power place” where sacred and secular activities not only occurred periodically in the same
location but are not distinctly separate (Gibson 2001:99–
100). Put another way, in the southeastern Indian cosmos such places were sometimes viewed as portals to
supernatural realms (cf. Hudson 1976:122–126). Whatever was the meaning of this mound in the local belief
system, the juxtaposition of the mortuary activity and
habitation debris may suggest that mound ceremonialism, involving feasting and/or periodic visitation to this

location, was a part of those beliefs.
The presence of an additional grave, containing
one adult and one or two infants, placed near the top of
the mound probably is an interment made after the construction of the mound had been completed. This later
burial may indicate that Black Hill continued to be a
“spirit place” of significance to prehistoric peoples in
the Sabine.
There possibly may be a further dimension to the
significance of Black Hill. There are indications, in
coastal southeast Texas, that significant population increases began in the Late Archaic to early ceramic—
sometime around 2000 to 3000 years BP (Aten
1983:320). These increased populations probably had
several effects, one of which was to force a differentiation of populations into smaller, discrete territories and
corresponding social groups. Another was to create a
means for symbolically marking territory (e.g., Aten
1983:Figure 17.1; Pardoe 1988; Russo 1996:259), a
need that could be met by cemeteries and/or mounds
as “power places.”
Black Hill Mound’s location is very close to the
reconstructed 18th century territorial boundary between
the Western Atakapa and the Akokisa tribes (Aten
1983:Figure 3.1). In addition, contemporary local informants have asserted that one or two other mounds
similar to Black Hill once existed along Hillebrandt and/
or Willow Marsh bayous but are thought to have been
destroyed during flood control channelization of those
streams early in the 20th century (Greene 2003; Long
1963). The existence of at least one and perhaps as
many as three small but constructed mounds, their
mortuary contents, their location along major streams
on the interfluve between the Sabine and the Trinity
rivers, and the affiliation with Tchefuncte culture taken
together may suggest a minimum time depth of approximately 2,000 years for a territorial boundary that
persisted to the historic period (cf., Aten 1983:308–
310).

OTHER EARLY CERAMIC SITES

INTRODUCTION
After reporting the larger collections and test excavations in previous chapters, we are devoted here to
wrapping up several early ceramic “loose ends.” There
are several small collections that were used in the ceramic seriation (Figure 4) but about which there is insufficient information to necessitate dedicating an entire chapter to each one. These collections are from
Bairds Bayou (41OR34), Conway D (16CU108), and
Gaulding (41JF27). The latter site is a previously published Late Archaic/Taylor Bayou Period locality (Aten
and Bollich 2002) and only the small collection of early
ceramic material is briefly summarized for use here.
Also included is information accumulated over the
course of more than six decades of surface collecting in
the Sabine Lake Area. From time to time, Gus Arnold,
C. N. Bollich, Russell Long, and others have found an
occasional sherd that is diagnostic of a Tchefuncte or a
Marksville association. These finds are identified and
summarized here because they enlarge our spatial sense
of early ceramic era settlement in the Sabine.
Finally, this chapter includes some very sketchy,
but nevertheless interesting, information from several
early ceramic sites that contain evidence of mortuary
practices. These meager data will augment a preliminary discussion of early ceramic settlement patterns in
the Sabine.
BAIRDS BAYOU (41OR34)
This site is 3.4 km northeast of downtown Beaumont, some 1¾ km due east of the Neches River (Figure 1). It is an extensively scattered earth midden
perched on the western end of a narrow remnant of
Deweyville fluvial terrace deposits that extends far out
into the Neches River floodplain from the Pleistocene
Beaumont Formation uplands. This terrace landform is
elevated from 1 to 3 m above the surrounding marsh

level; it conveniently allows by land, as Bairds Bayou
allows by water, access to the floodplain habitats and
resources north, south, and west of the site.
This location is at or just beyond the interior limit
of the brackish or estuarine “coastal” environments of
shell sites. Here, at the Bairds Bayou site, the edge of
the narrow Deweyville terrace remnant is wooded with
hickory, oaks, and pine. The adjacent Neches River
floodplain is a mix of marsh and extensive cypress indicating a change from the marshes that characterize the
floodplain beginning a kilometer or so downstream, to
the swampland upstream from this location.
The terrace landform is an area of modern industrial and construction activity that included the excavation of several borrow pits. In February 1964, at
the terrace’s western end and just beyond the borrow
pits, Bollich discovered a scattering of artifacts and at
least three low mounded features that he concluded
were pimple mounds. In 1964 Bollich excavated a single
five-foot-square test pit to a depth of 17 inches (43 cm)
in one of the pimple mounds. The sediment from the
surface to a depth of approximately 16 inches (40 cm)
was reported as reddish brown sandy silt overlying at
that depth a reddish brown sandy clay. There was no
evidence of organic midden discoloration nor were artifacts, that included both ceramics and lithics, common
suggesting this was not an intensively used site.
The remaining work at this site was surface collecting around the nearby borrow pits and various surface exposures in the immediate vicinity. In none of
this exploration was an abundance of artifacts discovered but by its close some 250 potsherds and 40 or so
lithic artifacts were found.
The collection was given to Dr. Harry Shafer
around 1975, when he was evaluating archeological resources in the Big Thicket (Shafer et al. 1975), and it
remains curated today at Texas A&M University. The
site locality was examined most recently in 1980 by an
archeological survey crew from a private firm (TARL

102

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

records). At that time the survey notes indicated that
industrial operations were expanding. It is not known
today if the site still exists.
Although the ceramics were not analyzed in detail
in the Big Thicket study mentioned above, they did
report that some sherds had Tchefuncte characteristics
and were associated with lithic dart points. Together
these features suggested the collection might date to
the early ceramic and contribute to the present study.
For this reason, the collection was re-examined and its
classification updated.
Collections
Ceramics
The sherd and vessel form attribute frequencies
identified in this collection are shown on Tables 32 and
33. As with all previous site collections, the types and
varieties are described in Appendix A. No exotic ceramic taxa were identified but the small proportions of
grog-tempered varieties, relatively low proportion of
Goose Creek Plain, unspecified variety, and the relatively large proportion of O’Neal Plain, variety Conway,
and the presence of a single Tchefuncte Incised sherd
clearly marks this collection as late Orange Period in
age (Figure 4).
Lithics—projectile points
Likewise, the projectile point occurrences are
shown on Table 32 and descriptions and metrics are
given in Appendix B. Only straight and contracting stem
forms of dart points were present in this collection—
Kent, Woden, and Gary—typical of Orange Period projectile point assemblages.
Other biface tools
End scraper, hand-held. This tool was made from
a smoothly rounded, elongate, silicified wood river
pebble (Figure 34, A–A’; Table 34). One end has been
split or flaked off parallel to the grain of the fossil wood.
The resulting flat surface was then unifacially chipped
into a blunt nose that subsequently developed use wear.
Because of the absence of modification of the proximal
end this tool is presumed to be a hand-held end scraper.
Arguably this tool could be classified as a uniface.
Small beaked tools, unknown function. One of

these tools is made on a primary cortex flake and the
others on interior thinning flakes (Figure 34, B–D; Table
34). All are bifacially chipped at one end to produce a
prominent beak. All appear to be convenience tools since
the only modification is to produce the beak. Only one
tool (Figure 34, C) is very heavily worn to the degree
of the beak being extremely dull. The beak on another
(Figure 34, D) is slightly worn.
Biface tool failures in manufacture
Unidentified tool, failed. All three of these artifacts were being bifacially worked and then broke. Two
show no use wear while one shows some wear on one
blade edge and may have been used as a convenience
tool.
Debris from lithic tool manufacturing
Bipolar core. This was a chert river pebble used
for producing bladelets by resting the cobble on a hard
surface and striking the opposite end with a
hammerstone (Figure 34, E; Table 34). The more or

platform. Flakes were struck from the entire circumference of the pebble. There is no indication that the
core itself was used for some other purpose.
CONWAY D (16CU108)
This site was a large Rangia cuneata shell mound
located a few hundred meters east of the Texas-Louisiana state line on a minor tributary of the Sabine River
(Figure 1). The site was being heavily eroded in the
1960s and early 1970s at the time it was recorded by
C. N. Bollich. A steep erosion face had been cut into
the in situ shell deposit with artifacts—mostly ceramics—dropped directly to the narrow beach. Diagnostic
Tchefuncte-associated ceramics were primarily found
at the south end of this beach exposure. Toward the
north end of the exposure the ceramics had transitioned
to some diagnostic Marksville-associated sherds. The
latter north-end collection was used here for seriation
purposes.
In 1971, Bollich also found, eroding from the
south end face of the deposit, a number of sherds that
appeared to be from a single vessel. These were collected separately and reconstructed. They all proved to
be from a single Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte

a complete rim to base profile (Appendix A, Figure 43).
Being able to document a whole Tchefuncte vessel is
very rare. The Conway D vessel is similar to some
illustrated from southeast Louisiana (Ford and Quimby
1945:Figure 17 g–h) and is unlike the vessels found in
northeast Texas at the Resch site (Webb et al. 1969:Figure 8).

A sample of Rangia cuneata shells also was collected from adjacent to the in situ sherds from this
vessel to use for radiocarbon dating. This was sample
TX-1230 listed in Table 1 in Chapter 2. Although originally reported in 1975, applying contemporary calibration methods to this sample yields a date of 2350 BP
with a two-standard deviation range from 2730 to 2080
BP, a very reasonable date for cultural deposits con-

Collections
Ceramics
The frequency of ceramics collected from the
north end of the Conway D site (Table 35) includes
small quantities of Tchefuncte-related varieties, a moderate proportion of O’Neal, variety Conway, and relatively large proportions of grog-tempered varieties which
seriate this collection in the middle of the Big Hill Period, late in the Sabine early ceramics prehistory. Vessel form frequencies are given in Table 36; descriptions
and illustrations of the ceramics are in Appendix A.

wide-blade knife that had snapped across the base of
the blade (Figure 34, F; Table 35). It had been skillfully
chipped bifacially from a large flake of high quality chert
(5YR6/3, light reddish brown). Such tools are relatively
rare in southeast Texas; not only was the material imported but making such large flakes and the skill in
working the flake into a finished biface tool are not
local capabilities either (Patterson 2005). But from
where it came is not known. The tool had been used a
lot since there is wear and smoothing all over this piece
except for the edges of the diagonal fracture across the
blade indicating that when the blade broke the proximal
end was discarded. The available metrics for this artifact are: maximum width=39.9 mm; maximum width
of the piece across the side-notches=35.2 mm; height
of the side notches=13.7 mm; and thickness of the
blade=7.4 mm. This was a well-made tool not at all
typical of upper Texas coast lithic technology.

GAULDING (41JF27)
The Gaulding site is a largely Late Archaic shell
mound in the Taylor Bayou drainage basin approximately 25 km south of downtown Beaumont, Texas
(Figure 1). An excavation was conducted at the Gaulding
site in 1965 during the TAS’s annual field school, and
modest further work was carried out in 1974 and 1995.
All of this has been reported previously (Aten and Bollich
2002) and as a result, artifact and other descriptions
will be limited here to what is needed for this early
ceramic investigation.
Broadly speaking, there were three phases of development represented at Gaulding. The earliest phase
was a two or three hundred year occupation dating to
the latest Middle Archaic or earliest Late Archaic period. After a hiatus in use of about 700 years another
two or three hundred year occupation occurred in the
Late Archaic period. After another hiatus of perhaps
500 years, a final period of intermittent use began that
appears to have included small quantities of early ceramics and relatively larger quantities of grog-tempered
varieties. The latter period is addressed in this section.

Collections
Ceramics
As a result of the mixture of ceramics from the
upper unit of Gaulding, this collection was seriated very
late into the Big Hill Period (Figure 4; Table 37). Ceramic descriptions and illustrations may be found in
Appendix A. Information on vessel forms is included in
Table 38.

been shaped to a point on one end and show wear
polish near the distal tip.

affected the northern Gulf coast as well (Aten and Bollich
2002:77–83). That study suggests the Tchefuncte culture (Tchula Period) of south Louisiana happened concurrently with a time when the Sanibel I low sea level
occurred. Subsequently, the Marksville culture occurred
during the succeeding Wulfert sea level high stand.
The details of this sea level study are too complex
to go into here and they are fully described in the Taylor Bayou study. However, if further investigation shows
the Late Holocene sea level changes to be verifiable,
then this too would offer a ready explanation for the
early ceramic site distributions. Tchefuncte-related sites
were occupied concurrently with a sea level period lower
than at present thus urging the conclusion that the sparse
site distribution is, to some degree, an artifact of preservation and archeological visibility. Similarly, the abundance of Marksville-related sites may be an artifact of
having occurred during a higher sea level phase and the
resulting greater visibility of those archeological sites.
EARLY CERAMIC MORTUARY SITES
Introduction
Mortuary practices are a class of archeological

information only remaining to a small degree in the
Sabine. At one time there were very large shell sites
ringing the north shore of Sabine Lake. These were
largely mined out by the middle of the 20th century but
at least 13 burials were recorded there apparently
younger in age than the early ceramic as suggested by
the presence of Caddoan ceramics (TARL records, site
41OR33).
Also there once was a series of very large shell
mounds near the mouth of the Neches at a location
then known as Grigsby’s Bluff. These were mined out
by the early years of the 20th century but were reported
to contain very large numbers of human skeletons.
Unfortunately there is no information indicating mortuary practices or what culture period might be represented by these enormous sites or by the numerous
human burials. But the newspaper headline of one of
the occasional articles published about these mounds
succinctly tells the story: “Area’s greatest archeological
site was ruined” (Block 1999).
Despite these losses of very large sites, there is
information available from some smaller ones that make
it possible to begin understanding the nature and role of
mortuary practices in early ceramic cultures. Four sites
will be discussed here: the Dredge site (41OR9), Black

longer exists—and its many interments were extraordinary for the
Sabine Lake Area. Although 41OR9
can be spoken of only in general
terms, this is worth doing. The other
three sites have all been described
previously in this investigation but
their mortuary components will be
reviewed here. Black Hill had eight
burials, Eddleman may have had
three, and Gaulding had one. Taken
together, they begin to reveal some
elements of local treatment of the
dead and associated early ceramic
ritual.

tematic investigation has been undertaken, digging by
local collectors began in the 1960s; they probably saw
the same bone debris noted by Arnold, and decided to
act on it.
Sometime between 1987 and 1996 the site was
dredged to recover the shell. As it turned out, apparently the shell/sediment ratio was too high for the material to be suitable for commercial use so the entire site
now sits in three large piles of debris adjacent to its
former location. The Dredge site is now destroyed except for thin, marginal, shell layers or stringers embedded in the floodplain sediment around the periphery of
the water-filled hole left after the site was quarried out.
Despite the overall site destruction, the remnant marginal shell stringers may still be valuable for radiocarbon dating of the site, for collecting paleoecological information from Rangia cuneata, and perhaps for other
lines of investigation such as pollen and sedimentation.
The Dredge site was the object of uncontrolled
digging for many years but its location was not revealed.
C. N. Bollich was first shown artifacts and skeletal
material by the collectors in 1964 and was shown additional material intermittently after that, mention of which
he recorded at the time in his personal journal. These
included sherds with the wide incised lines characteristic of Marksville or Troyville. Recognizing the significance of the site, Bollich unsuccessfully urged them to
stop digging or otherwise to make notes, use better field

techniques, protect the site, and so on.
In 1969, he was taken to the site only after agreeing not to reveal its location. At that time he recognized
the site was 41OR9 (Figure 1) originally discovered
and reported by Gus Arnold as noted above. Bollich
was able to make notes further clarifying the geometry
and structure of the site. As indicated by the geometry
of the dredged out hole, the underlying shell mound
was not circular but instead was a long, narrow ridge
oriented approximately parallel to the Neches River channel where it formerly was located. At some time after
habitation of the shell site had ceased, a more or less
circular, flat-topped layer of dark clayey floodplain sediment some 2-3 ft (±0.5-1 m) high, and an estimated 66
feet (20 m) in diameter or 318 m2 area, was artificially
piled up on one end of the shell ridge, and this became
the mortuary mound (Figure 36). The shell ridge’s dimensions are not known but its length extended several
times the approximate diameter of the burial mound.
The upper foot or so (±25 cm) of the mound
addition was a midden-like, loamy, dark soil with some
Rangia cuneata shell. Underlying this was more or less
another foot (±25 cm) of very dense, heavy clay. And
below the clay was the dense deposit of Rangia cuneata
clam shells extending down to an unknown depth that
comprised the underlying shell ridge. The clay layer
evidently was the primary layer of the burial mound.
The alternative, that it may have been a blanket deposit

the Coral Snake Mound, some 150 km north northeast
(Jelks 1965; Jensen 1968). In the 1980s, Dr. Bollich
collected pottery from where uprooted trees had exposed the shell ridge. These collections contained abundant O’Neal Plain, variety Conway and at least one or
two Marksville sherds indicating the upper levels of the
shell ridge were early ceramic in age and that the burial
mound was later, but not much later.
It seems that this low mound platform was built
to create a place in which many corpses would be buried; if only an occasional burial was anticipated this
almost certainly would have been placed in a shallow
grave dug into the shell ridge. The mound, or platform,
began with the placement of a thick layer of dense clay
that was succeeded by a similarly thick layer of loamy
soil that, in time, came to hold a large number of burials. There is no field information to indicate whether
the individuals were added occasionally or whether many
were added at the same time, as when a charnel house
might be emptied.

The local collectors confined their digging in the
burial platform to the east half in an area Bollich estimated to be about 8 ft2 (or 6 m2). They said, further,
that most of the burials they had uncovered, estimated
by them to have been about 32 individuals, were found
in the upper loamy layer, not in the underlying dense
clay layer and they never dug below it into the underlying shell deposit.
The excavation approach of the collectors when
finding a skull was to clear around it, place it in a box,
and work on cleaning the sediment from the cranial
portion at their homes. Little attention usually was given
to excavating the post-cranial skeletons or to documenting burial positions. No burial sketches exist and the
only information on types of interment comes from
two or three burials. One skeleton in a tightly flexed
position was partially cleared and observed at the site.
One of the unaccessioned burials found in a flexed position was removed later as a block and this burial presently is at TARL. Another burial (labeled Burial D by

114

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

the collectors) consisted solely of a skull resting on a
roughly rectangular stone slab (described below). This
particular skull also had a bone projectile point penetrating the frontal bone and may have been a trophy
head. These materials are also curated at TARL. The
indications are the burials, in the area dug by the collectors, commonly were tightly flexed and were encountered at the rate of one every 2 ft2 (or about 0.2 m2).
Collections
At various times and places a number of grave
goods were observed or were asserted to have been
included with burials, although this cannot be guaranteed. In any event, the descriptions of accessioned partial skeletons that follow try to preserve associations
originally assigned by the collectors as much as possible. References to burials A, B, C, etc., likewise preserve the original sequence labeling assigned by the collectors.
Burial A. Three unidentified sherds, and shell and
animal bone fragments reportedly were included but
probably were just materials included in the matrix.
Burial B. Six unidentified sherds were reported,
also probably from the mound matrix or elsewhere and
not grave goods.
Burial D. This burial apparently was a trophy head.
All that was present was the skull, with a bone point
penetrating the cranium at the left frontal bone, placed
on a large slab of sandstone. The sandstone was trapezoidal in shape, 22 cm long, 16 cm wide, and about 2
cm thick and had a shallow (3 mm deep) depression in
the center of one side. Apparently this slab had once
been used as a grinding stone or metate. It was a fineto medium-grained sand with white cement, possibly
originating from the Catahoula Formation. This is far
and away the largest piece of sandstone we have seen
on the coast and obviously was imported from the interior.
Burial G. Included with this burial is a flat calcium
carbonate concretion (7.3 cm long, 4.7 mm wide, and
1.6 cm thick) with a 6 mm diameter hole through the
center. Erosion of one side of the center hole suggests
it was suspended and may have been a pendant or,
more likely, a net weight. Also packaged with this skeleton was a fragment of a possibly Early Archaic dart
point, six biface fragments, and 12 large chert flakes.
The form of the dart point is most unlike points ordinarily found in southeast Texas and the other 18 lithic

fragments are larger than typically found here. At this
time it is anyone’s guess whether these chipped stone
tools and flakes were interred with this burial.
Burial H. In addition to the skull, fragments of
clavicle, scapula, humerus, and bones of the hand were
included suggesting this skull was removed from a flexed
interment. A number of small lumps of asphalt (roughly
2 cm in length, width, and thickness) were curated with
this burial.
Unidentified burial. In the field Bollich observed
an incompletely excavated skull with large tubular columella beads in position around the neck. The diameter of these beads, about 1.5 inches (±3.5 cm) is quite
unusual. Columellae of such great size probably could
not have come from estuaries on the northern Gulf of
Mexico, but instead indicate these people had some
access to lower Mississippi valley trade routes probably extending as far as south Florida.
Unidentified burial. Enclosed with this burial that
had a site number but no sequence number was a box
with several deer bone awls (four ulna, one metapodial);
two socketed bone points; a large section of antler; a
shell scoop or spoon made from the outer whorl of a
Busycon sp. (5.8 cm by 6.2 cm and beveled along one
edge); a large, poorly preserved freshwater mussel valve;
and two rocks, possibly hammerstones. The shell scoop
is like those described earlier from the Orange Period
assemblages at the Eddleman and Black Hill sites.
Mix of several burials. At least five, and perhaps
more, individuals were mixed together in this not-yetaccessioned box. Also included was a small jar of red
ochre fragments (±2 cm on a side); several deer bone
awls (one ulna, one metapodial, one splinter, three socketed bone, and two awl shaft fragments); and about 15
sherds mostly Baytown Plain, variety San Jacinto and
a few Baytown Plain, variety Phoenix Lake.
Miscellaneous artifacts. Bollich recorded in his
notes several other significant grave-associated artifacts
that he was shown by the collectors in the 1960’s. There
were three broken but complete small ceramic vessels
observed. These almost certainly must be grave goods
as complete vessels are almost never found in the Sabine
in domestic habitation contexts. All three were recognized as O’Neal Plain, variety Conway. They all were
unrestricted bowl forms (form U-3, see Appendix A,
Figure 48). Two vessels had conical bases and a sharp
or ridged lip, and were about the same size: 9.5 cm
orifice diameter and about 7.6 cm deep. The other vessel was also an unrestricted U-3 bowl but had a round

Chapter 6: Other Early Ceramic Sites

or spherical base and a flat lip with diagonal lip notching. The orifice diameter was 14.3 cm and vessel height
was about 16.5 cm.
Additionally, there were two bone fishhooks; a
cut and polished mandible of a canid longitudinally split
across the roots of the teeth; a boatstone; a triangular
stone pendant (about 1 cm thick and with a drilled hole
at each end for suspension); and a fossilized end of
unidentified bison long bone as reported by Prof. Russell
Long (C.N. Bollich field notes).
Human osteology
As noted earlier, the collectors believed they had
excavated 32 individuals and usually the cranial and
near cranial bones only. Then, after the death of one of
the collectors, most of these skeletal remains and some
of the artifacts were transferred to TARL for curation.
Although at least eight individuals remain to be
accessioned, here we want to summarize the findings
recorded on the TARL human osteology laboratory
worksheets. There were burials labeled with sequence
identification letters A through J. These 10 letters actually incorporated a minimum of 19 individuals. There
were eight males and four females; the sex of two children and five adults could not be determined. The estimates of age distribution favored longevity: two children aged 5 to 8; six adults aged around 18 to 35; and
11 adults aged 35 to 50. A variety of pathologies were
noted: traumatic injury, healed bone fracture, dental
abcesses and periodontal disease, excessively worn
teeth, and occasional arthritic lipping.
Given the way these skeletons were obtained it is
hard to draw conclusions about health and demography. The absence of infant skeletons may have to do
with selection of individuals for inclusion in the cemetery platform or, alternatively, it may reflect only the
excavation method. Neither does there appear a basis
for suspecting any gender or age selection for inclusion
in the cemetery among the adults. Except for the Burial
D individual, whose skull was interred on a “platter”
(i.e., the large sandstone slab) with a bone point penetrating the frontal bone, the pathologies are not unusual for a prehistoric population on the northern Gulf
coast.

site cemetery mound. Bollich found Marksville-like
sherds at the site but not with a clear association with
either the shell ridge or the burial platform. The end of
use of the shell ridge as a habitation site seems to have
been early ceramic, and the probable common use of
O’Neal Plain, variety Conway vessels in graves may
suggest that the construction and use of the platform
mound on top of the shell ridge happened relatively
soon thereafter, in culture chronology terms.
There is little that can be said about whether the
people interred in this mound possessed special status
or about the nature of their mortuary ritual. What can
be said is that mortuary ritual among the western
Atakapa under certain circumstances seems to have involved specially built structures that symbolized something. Interments were quite crowded and the presence
of at least some very tightly flexed skeletons may reflect use of a charnel house or similar means for reducing the bulk of body mass before burial.
Unfortunately, as a result of having only anecdotal reports of the excavation, it is not known if graves
for new interments commonly disrupted previous burials thereby suggesting the distinction of “near dead versus long dead.” In other words, recently deceased individuals had to be “processed” according to accepted
measures for handling the dead and their spirits. But
after a period of time in the grave the buried body’s
spirit departed and disrupting the grave to place a new
burial was permitted. This may have been the case with
burials at the Eddleman site to be described below.
Finally, Burial D, the lone skull penetrated in front
by a bone projectile point casts a little light on obscure
mortuary practices. The Burial D individual could have
been a member of the local western Atakapa who was
killed elsewhere by group enemies and his head was
brought home for interment rather than attempting to
bring the whole body back, or to leave him wherever
he was killed. On the other hand, Burial D may have
been an enemy and his head was kept to deprive him
of being returned home. Or it may not signify intergroup conflict but rather some totally different manner
of ritual. At this time it reminds us to be alert to appropriate evidence, and to know that the head, by itself,
has special importance.
Other evidence of mortuary practices

Conclusions
There is no certainty about the age of the Dredge

In addition to the cemetery platform at the Dredge
site—the most elaborate mortuary in the Sabine about

116

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

which there is any information—there are three other
sites with mortuary evidence, all of which have already
been discussed: Black Hill Mound (41JF24); Eddleman
(41OR49); and Gaulding (41JF27). Each of these sites
appears to have fitted into early ceramic mortuary practice in the Sabine at a different scale.
While the Dredge site was a ritual location that
accommodated a large number of burials possibly
through a variety of steps or stages, the next largest
mortuary—Black Hill Mound—apparently was another
ritual or sacred location with a complex physical structure but only a few burials (Chapter 5). Despite this,
surprisingly, both sites were approximately the same
size in areal extent: the Dredge site mortuary measures
approximately 318 m2 while the Black Hill Mound measures approximately 394 m2, although this may be a
distinction without a difference given the crude basis
available for making these estimates.
Burials at Black Hill, like those at Dredge site,
apparently made ready use of grave goods although not
in as much variety. Similarly, there also is no information from Black Hill Mound suggesting whether or not
the “near dead versus long dead” principle was operating there. But an indication that Black Hill was recognized as a sacred location over the long term is the
interment of several individuals into the early Middle
Archaic midden layer and much later the interment of
more burials after deposition of the upper, early ceramic level.
Then there was the Eddleman site where a single
flexed burial was recorded along with a few scattered
remains of two other individuals (Chapter 3). The burial
appears to have been interred in a shallow grave dug
into the midden deposit; there was no construction of

any special structure for the dead (e.g. charnel house,
burial platform, cemetery, etc.), but here we may be
seeing operation of the “near dead versus long dead”
principle.
Finally, there is the Gaulding site where a single
shallow grave was placed sometime after the Late Archaic occupation (Aten and Bollich 2002:73–74). What
is the meaning of these different mortuary settings? What
territory or resource is symbolized or delimited by these
sites (cf., Pardoe 1988). Resources may or may not be
the issue as all territories around the coastal periphery
of the Sabine shared similar resources. But territory
may have been another matter. By reference to the
western Atakapa territorial map (Figure 1) it can be
seen that the Dredge site mortuary platform was placed
in the heart of the western side of this territory and that
Black Hill Mound is near—and may have signified—
the western periphery.
Eddleman and Gaulding, on the other hand, may
signal no special significance other than a need to observe a burial ritual. When a member of the corporate
group died elsewhere than near one of the active cemeteries, the rule may have been to dig a shallow grave
into the surface of a nearby and no-longer used habitation site.
Taking the 41OR9 mortuary structure together
with that at Black Hill Mound (41JF24) and the possibility of a now-destroyed second or even a third mound
on Hillebrandt Bayou requires consideration of the level
of mortuary ritual among the ancestors of the western
Atakapa as being at a distinctively different, more complex level than among the ancestors of the co-linguistic
Akokisa or Bidai who together formed part of the western boundary of the Mossy Grove Tradition.

CONCLUSIONS: THE EMERGING CERAMIC FRAMEWORK IN THE SABINE LAKE AREA

INTRODUCTION
Construction of a culture-historical framework for
the Sabine Lake Area began nearly seven decades ago
with T. N. Campbell’s description and pioneering synthesis of archeological excavations along the Texas coast
(1947). The most notable implication of that work for
the present investigation of early ceramic sites is that
Campbell may have been the first archeologist to call
attention to the presence of lower Mississippi valley
ceramics, in particular Marksville pottery, in collections
from the Sabine. After that, archeology in the Sabine
was dormant until the late 1950s and 1960s when C.
D. Eddleman excavated at 41OR49 and C. N. Bollich
began an active program of site surveying and surface
collecting throughout the Sabine Lake Area of Texas
and Louisiana. A first effort to synthesize information
from some of those collections into a ceramics-based
culture-historical framework was published at that time
(Aten and Bollich 1969; also see Weinstein 1986).
Since that time a considerable amount of new information has come to hand. Evidence for the presence of Paleo-Indian as well as Early and Middle Archaic peoples making use of the area has been welldocumented in collections made at McFaddin Beach
(Hester et al. 1992; Long 1977; Stright et al. 1999) and
Black Hill Mound (Chapter 5, this study). In 1965,
members of the TAS excavated radiocarbon dated Late
Archaic to early ceramic occupations at the Gaulding
site on Taylor Bayou (Aten and Bollich 2002). The
several excavated and surface-collected assemblages
now attributable to the early ceramic periods and documented in the present study enable further refinement
of the Sabine Lake Area local chronology extending
through much of the early ceramics-using cultures.
The present investigation focuses exclusively on
the early ceramic (Figure 2). Named constructs such as

“phase” or “culture” are not used because of their implication of greater understanding of the functional complexities of local cultures and social groups. But the
common occurrence of a pottery or projectile point type
is not likely to define a culture or society. Nevertheless
such indicator artifacts often are key markers of relative ages of the materials with which they are associated. Despite the greater availability and reliability of
radiocarbon dating nowadays, many situations still exist where absolute dating is not yet available. As was
done in formulating local chronologies for the adjacent
Galveston Bay Area and other Mossy Grove Tradition
regions west of the Sabine (Aten 1983:271 ff), assemblage sequences of abundant and distinctive artifacts in
the Sabine are divided into sequential periods supported,
if possible, with absolute dating.
These chronological periods are envisioned as recognizable periods of time with which it becomes possible to start mapping the time and space occurrence of
the various elements of prehistoric cultures—their technology, subsistence, settlement, and ritual—and begin
working out an elementary understanding of what constituted cultures and society in the Sabine during the
early ceramic. But the apparent distribution of these
cultures and societies may not coincide with the artifacts-based time periods or “phases.” A comprehensive
review of previous archeological investigations in the
area and of the status of several research themes—
culture chronology, geoarcheology and site formation,
paleoecology, site types and settlement patterns, technology, subsistence and seasonal movements, mortuary practices, and territoriality—was included in a recent study (Aten and Bollich 2002:4–5). These topics,
except for “paleoecology” about which we have no new
information, will be used to organize the following discussion of conclusions reached about early ceramic sites
from the present investigation.

118

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

CULTURE CHRONOLOGY
Ceramic collections from seven sites were seriated
with controls based on a combination of stratigraphic
succession for excavated sites, and pattern development (Figure 4). These, in turn, were supported by a
small amount of information from radiocarbon dating.
Dates previously published from the Gaulding site (Table
1; Aten and Bollich 2002:22) established reasonably
well the termination of the Late Archaic and beginning
of the early ceramic in the Sabine at roughly 2500 years
BP. A mean date from the Conway D site for a
Tchefuncte pottery association fell rather neatly at 2350
years BP, and another sample from 41JF11 for an assemblage that postdates early ceramics was dated at
approximately 1300 years BP (Table 4). Thus the
seriated early ceramic collections in the Sabine must fit
between probably somewhat earlier than 1300 BP and
2500 years BP.
The ceramic seriation that was compiled generally exhibits distinct patterns of “battleship” curves with
ragged spots here and there (Figure 4). For now this is
the best patterning available and is significantly constrained, or structured, by the stratigraphic sequences
of the excavated collections. There are several notable
aspects to the relative abundance patterns in Figure 4.
The most abundant of the earliest pottery is the
temperless Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte joined
soon after by the sand-tempered O’Neal Plain, variety
Conway, the latter apparently related in some way to
the Alexander series. Then, as variety Tchefuncte and
variety Conway decline in popularity the sandy paste
version of Tchefuncte Plain—variety Mandeville—
begins its brief period of popularity.
As variety Tchefuncte and variety Mandeville
decline to extinction, variety Conway only reduces somewhat in popularity but continues as an important element of Sabine ceramics well into the Late Prehistoric.
While Tchefuncte Plain varieties and O’Neal Plain are
shifting around, the grog-tempered varieties of Baytown
Plain are persistent parts of the local assemblage but to
a relatively minor degree. As the Tchefuncte Plain varieties go to extinction in the Sabine, Goose Creek Plain
and the Baytown Plain varieties begin a significant expansion at the end of the early ceramic. This is in notable distinction to the assemblage development in the
Galveston Bay Area where grog-tempered varieties are
essentially absent until after the end of the early ceramic periods (Aten 1983:Figures 14.1 and 15.1).

Looking at the overall pattern of this seriation there
seems to be definite change in the dynamic of pottery
technology occurring around the time of the lower levels of Pipkin Ranch sites 41JF31A and 41JF31B: The
Tchefuncte and O’Neal types decline and grog-tempered Baytown types increase. Although there is insufficient information to say whether this is a rapid or
gradual shift, or if variety Tchefuncte and variety
Mandeville really tail off slowly, or if occasional
Marksville sherds really do show up in the earlier end
of the area’s ceramic history, somewhat overlapping
with Tchefuncte-related varieties, or if these things are
a function of the kind of collections being used, nevertheless it is an important change in the technology and
is used here to divide the early ceramic seriation into
two major parts: The earlier part, predominantly characterized by Tchefuncte-related pottery, is called the
Orange Period, and the successor, associated more with
occasional Marksville-related pottery, is called the Big
Hill Period.
There is no similar ceramic seriation yet in southwest Louisiana with which to compare the seriation for
the Sabine. However, looking to the west a comparison
can be made. Excluding the grog-tempered and other
types that are not present in the Galveston Bay Area,
patterns in the early end of the Galveston seriation (Aten
1983:Figure 14.1) compare favorably to those for the
Sabine (Figure 4). The patterns of Tchefuncte Plain,
O’Neal Plain, what was then called Mandeville Plain,
and the Goose Creek Plain, variety Anahuac all resemble the new Sabine seriation beginning in the Big
Hill Period, which is as it should be since the earliest
Galveston Bay ceramics probably are several hundred
years younger than in the Sabine. There is insufficient
radiocarbon and diagnostic artifact information to parse
the Sabine chronology with the Galveston Bay chronology yet, but the current best guess can be seen in
Figure 5. Although the two areas cannot be precisely
correlated, they do seem to be on a path toward coming together.
GEOARCHEOLOGY AND SITE FORMATION
Addressing questions about site formation in the
Sabine was begun at 41JF31B (Pipkin Ranch), Black
Hill Mound, and Gaulding. With the limited exception
of core studies at Gaulding, work at these sites was not
able to employ newer techniques such as micromorphology; nevertheless the results have been interesting

Chapter 7: Conclusions: The Emerging Early Ceramic Framework in the Sabine Lake Area

just as a consequence of asking about formation processes.
At Pipkin Ranch the important results have been
straightforward. The presence of undisturbed archeological midden zones within the sediment column of
the pimple mounds provides incontrovertible evidence
that this particular mound field has formed through
aggradational processes. The reason for Native Americans being there apparently was to gather marsh resources and then to retreat to small, presumably drier,
campsite locations on the then modestly elevated surfaces of pimple mounds. In time, continued sediment
accumulation buried the archeological strata. This
aggradational origin may not be the case for other pimple
mounds, which are found in many different regions
and not just the Gulf Coast, but it is the case in the
Sabine. Knowing this is a valuable starting place for
additional inferences and research.
The general ground surface at the Pipkin Ranch
sites is less than 5 feet (1.5 m) above sea level and the
locality is only 7 miles (11 km) from the Gulf shore as
the crow flies. The nick points at the base of pimple
mound 41JF31B suggest the periodic occurrence of erosion around the base of the mounds may have been the
result of storm surges or perhaps periodic Late Holocene higher sea levels (Aten and Bollich 2002:Figure
30). They further suggest that erosion of the basal
mound and the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation silty
clay of the intermound area may be the source of sediment from which the mounds were built. Other questions follow from the basic finding that the mounds are
aggradational, such as by what process was the coarser
sediment fraction added to the mounds, where did the
clay go, what was (or is) the rate of mound accumulation and did all mounds form simultaneously? But they
were not erosional, or gas vents, or gopher mounds, or
any of the multitude of other mechanisms that have
been suggested (Aten and Bollich 1981; Washburn
1988).
The core of archeological interest in the Black
Hill Mound site has much to do with its means of formation; was it a structure intentionally built to a plan
and for a secular or a sacred purpose, or both. The
answers to such questions reflect significantly on the
complexity and sophistication of the western Atakapa
culture. The reconnaissance investigation of Black Hill
Mound in 2003 included a small stratigraphic test pit,
extended topographic mapping around the site’s periphery, and a 25-foot-long profile trench (Chapter 5).

119

The test excavation, although not conclusive,
seemed to indicate the black midden comprising the
mound actually was a superimposed sequence of two
deposits. The lower was radiocarbon dated to a midden
of Early or Middle Archaic age into which several burials had been placed subsequent to the Middle Archaic.
Then a second midden layer, probably dating to the
early ceramic based on diagnostic pottery it contained,
was placed above the first midden layer. At a later time,
additional burials were placed in this upper midden layer.
The profile trench showed that the first midden
layer was accumulated on the now buried paleosol at
the surface of the Beaumont Formation and that the
second—later—midden layer, the likely source of the
early ceramic artifacts, had been formed on top of the
first layer. And the whole pile of the mound was buried
around its periphery by material eroded and transported
downslope from the interfluve. The topographic mapping conducted there discovered a series of ripples, or
very low relief ridges and swales encircling the mound.
The Black Hill Mound, if it were not so buried,
would display a relief of about 2 meters. Although the
mound does not appear to have been built as a structure in the ordinary sense of, say, Jonas Short or Coral
Snake mounds, it was a mound at least in a morphological sense. A very early first layer was deposited as
midden and then at least five individuals were buried in
it. A second midden layer was deposited, probably during the Orange Period (early ceramic), directly over the
original one and sometime later an adult and one or two
infants were buried in that. There still remain questions
such as were these two layers in situ habitation or were
they midden fill brought from some nearby but now
unknown locations. But the long term continuity of
Native Americans viewing this site as a sacred locality
is hard to escape.
At the same time, the profile trench revealed no
visible evidence that would explain the ridge and swale
geomorphology of the peripheral area and so we are
left only with an hypothesis that the ridges may record
long term periods of greater rainfall in which sediment
was moved downslope at a more rapid rate causing it
to pile up as it neared the obstruction of the archeological mound. In the intervening periods of less precipitation, not as much material would be transported thus
accounting for the swales. This is merely a plausible
hypothesis; and it may no longer be possible to test it at
this location because there has been such extensive
modification and construction on the upslope area be-

120

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

hind the site, but there may be other locations in the
area where the proposition could be tested.
Analysis of the Gaulding site was the first attempt
at addressing the formation processes of a shell-bearing
site (Aten and Bollich 2002) in the Sabine. While the
majority of the site’s archeological deposits were of
Taylor Bayou Period (Late Archaic) age, a thin layer
near the surface contained materials of early ceramic—
probably Big Hill Period—and later age. The preliminary sedimentological analysis done there suggested
these upper deposits—at least where they were tested—
were not habitation areas primarily but peripheral living
wastes as well as discarded broken artifacts.
Gaulding and other sites in the Taylor Bayou basin also exhibited some peculiar geometry relative to
their positions in the landscape. This ultimately led to
application of the Tanner hypothesis for minor Late
Holocene sea level fluctuations to coastal southeast Texas
and southwest Louisiana geomorphic and archeological
features. W. F. Tanner and other workers on the Florida
Gulf coast developed this model; see Aten and Bollich
(2002:77–83; Figure 30) for a detailed discussion and
citations. The most notable implication for the present
investigation is to provide an explanation for early ceramic settlement distributions in the Sabine as discussed
below.
Maps (Figure 35) of the distribution of Sabine
sites containing either Tchefuncte-related ceramics (Orange Period) or Marksville-related ceramics (late Orange and Big Hill Period) show a substantially greater
number of the latter and the question arises as to whether
that is a significant difference. In fact, the Sanibel I low
sea level phase appears to correlate largely with the age
of the Tchefuncte culture and the subsequent Wulfert
high sea level phase correlates largely with the age of
the Marksville culture (Aten and Bollich 2002:Figure
30). On this basis it can be suggested that the difference in number of sites is significant, but as an indication that the earlier (Tchefuncte-related) streamside sites
are necessarily at a lower elevation or a lower stratigraphic level and therefore are often not visible without
archeological excavation. The Marksville-related sites,
however, may be established in relation to a much higher
streamside elevation and so many more of those locations are visible today.
It can be argued, in the absence of any more concrete information, that sea level hasn’t anything to do
with this; there simply were fewer Tchefuncte-related
sites. While this may be, it is not what the totality of

evidence suggests. Tchefuncte-related ceramic varieties are present in much greater quantities in the Sabine
than are Marksville-related sherds which are mostly
confined to versions of Marksville Stamped. Moreover,
Tchefuncte sherds are quite prominent in the Galveston
Bay Area while, to this time, no Marksville sherds of
any kind are reported there. The differential in visibility
between sites with Tchefuncte versus those with
Marksville sherds is most probably due to some mechanism masking the earlier sites and that mechanism may
well be Late Holocene sea level fluctuations.
SETTLEMENT PATTERNS
This study has only produced modest new information about site types and settlement patterns beyond
implications of the Sabine Lake Area landscape for early
human settlement as was discussed recently in the
Gaulding report (Aten and Bollich 2002:3–4). Perhaps
the most important thing is the realization that there are
important sites in the coastal Sabine that are not shell
bearing; more than half of the recognized early ceramic
sites are earth middens. These include Bollich’s discovery of midden zones within actively forming pimple
mounds at Pipkin Ranch and at Bairds Bayou on the
floodplain of the Neches River; and there are two
midden levels at Black Hill Mound in the upper
Hillebrandt watershed. Interestingly all of these sites
are in ecotones. Black Hill and Bairds Bayou are on
streams a short distance above the usual limit of brackish water clam habitat, and the Pipkin Ranch pimple
mound sites are at the contact between coastal prairies
and coastal marshes.
The shell-bearing sites have some differences as
well. First, they are all or nearly all comprised of the
brackish water clam Rangia cuneata with very minor
amounts of freshwater mussels and/or of estuarine oysters. The Eddleman site appears to be a sheet midden
while all the other shell sites discussed are mounded
shell sites for want of a better term. That is to say they
are long, narrow, and thick. These shell sites are
ecotonal, as well, positioned astride the intersection of
aquatic (stream or lake) and terrestrial (floodplain or
upland) habitats.
And lastly, there are two mortuary sites that involved special earthen constructions. The Dredge site
had a large earthen platform built on top of one end of
a mounded shell site, and the Black Hill site has the
previously mentioned two successive earth midden

Chapter 7: Conclusions: The Emerging Early Ceramic Framework in the Sabine Lake Area

zones—sometimes called “black earth middens”
(McBride et al. 1997:55)—each with burials placed in
them and piled up, apparently intentionally, to create a
mound structure as discussed earlier under the topic of
site formation.
It is not easy to suggest the functionality of all
these sites mainly because the methods by which materials were recovered differed so much, especially in the
amount of site area that was excavated. The greatest
variety of artifact classes clearly come from the Black
Hill and Eddleman sites, although if all the excavation
levels are totaled for pimple mounds 41JF31A and
41JF31B these show some variety as well. In any event,
acknowledging that artifact diversity may be due in part
to differences in the extent of excavation, the three occurrence tables just cited indicate a much greater array
of material in the Orange Period sites than later.
This is not unlike the more or less correlative early
ceramic Clear Lake and Mayes Island periods in
Galveston Bay (Figure 2). While the Clear Lake Period, which appears to correlate with the Orange Period in the Sabine, has a diversity of pottery types, the
succeeding Mayes Island Period has very little not unlike the approximately correlated Big Hill Period in the
Sabine.
The artifact assemblages found at the Eddleman
and Black Hill sites are much more extensive and suggestive of longer duration occupation (such as at seasonal base camps) than those at Pipkin Ranch, Bairds
Bayou, and even Gaulding that may have been short
occupation sites from mobile periods of the seasonal
movements.
Finally, the two specially constructed cemetery
sites, as was discussed in Chapter 6, are possibly symbols of the social group in the case of Dredge site, and
of territorial boundaries in the case of Black Hill Mound.
TECHNOLOGY
The various technologies evident at the early ceramic sites usually are sparsely represented at any given
site or excavation unit and so the individual collection
data are grouped together in various ways to give a
clearer sense of variation, context, and patterns. For
example, ceramic type and variety descriptions are developed in Appendix A based on characteristics of all
sherds in all sites. Likewise, projectile point descriptions are developed in Appendix B based on a common
sorting of points from all sites and to a lesser degree

121

this was also the approach for describing other tool
forms. Since the present investigation seeks to begin
identifying the characteristic cultural patterns of early
ceramic societies in the Sabine, the alternative of atomizing artifact descriptions—a necessary approach for
certain purposes—is not the approach relied upon here.
Ceramics
The most effective initial approach to analyzing
prehistoric ceramics in southeast Texas has proved to
be classification on the basis of paste characteristics
supplemented where possible by design treatments.
Decorated pottery, however, rarely exceeds 5 percent
of a collection and so paste characteristics for all practical purposes are the principal basis for subdividing a
sherd collection. There are five indigenous ceramic
wares present in the Sabine early ceramic collections
(see Appendix A, Table 42) each mainly represented by
plainware and supplemented by small quantities of decorated ceramics. In addition to the five indigenous ceramic wares in the Sabine, there are occasional plain
and decorated sherds of unknown association that made
use of locally unfamiliar paste or decorative treatments.
The plainwares were used in Chapter 2 to create
an early ceramic seriation (Figure 4) the patterns of
which lent themselves to division into two parts: the
Orange Period noted by relatively large proportions of
Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte and O’Neal Plain,
variety Conway, particularly small amounts of Baytown
Plain varieties, and occasionally by a decorated sherd
bearing distinct similarity to Tchefuncte-related types
and possibly even Marksville-related types. These were
succeeded by the Big Hill Period assemblage signified
by relatively large proportions of Baytown Plain varieties and Goose Creek Plain (variety unspecified), particularly small amounts of Tchefuncte Plain types, the
continuation of O’Neal Plain, variety Conway, and occasionally by a Marksville-related decorated sherd but
apparently no occurrences of Tchefuncte-related decorated sherds. With this seriation available, it is possible
to estimate a collection’s age and cultural association,
and to begin placing other artifacts and site features
into a culture-historical framework.
To further comprehend the dynamics of early ceramics apparent from the sites studied here, Figure 37
lists all of the ceramic categories identified and their
position in the seriation. Occurrence at each site of the
various pottery types is indicated by letters identifying

the particular ware or decorative association represented
by each. Like occurrences are then signified and set
apart by a box. This figure shows that while each of the
five plainwares occurs largely throughout both the Orange and the Big Hill periods, albeit in significantly evolving proportions, the decorated sherds have much more
circumscribed distributions.
Tchefuncte decorated sherds are confined to the
Orange Period, as are those showing a combined Goose
Creek and Tchefuncte association as well as the sandtempered decorated sherds related to O’Neal Plain.
Decorated sherds with a Marksville or combined Goose
Creek-Marksville association begin in the Orange Period and continue for a time into the Big Hill Period.
Discrete Goose Creek and Baytown-related decorated
sherds begin in mid-Orange Period and continue through
the Big Hill Period and into the subsequent late ceramic. The sherds of unknown association are occurrences that cannot be seen at this time as forming a
particular pattern. In time, when there is a clearer understanding of the late ceramic the patterns that are
seen to begin in the early ceramic may take on greater
meaning, but their beginning is seen here (Figure 37).
It was mentioned earlier that while our previous
study of ceramics at the Gaulding site focused on ferreting out details of the paste characteristics of the major pottery groups, the present investigation took advantage of the larger number of sherds available to inquire into vessel forms, usually a difficult aspect of
ceramics to examine in this region. Oriented rim profiles and vessel bases were drawn wherever possible.
Sorting shapes of these dozens of profiles led to construction of an upper vessel body profile classification
(Figure 48), and to recording orifice diameter as a proxy
for overall vessel size (Table 44). The classification
recognizes some nine upper body shapes included in
the early ceramic collections and documented in the
description of each collection in the preceding chapters. However, since all these vessel form variations
are generally present in such small numbers on any
given pottery variety, the most meaningful distinction
among these shapes at the present time is to consolidate them into restricted versus unrestricted vessels
(Table 43). The number of recordable oriented rims,
bases, and orifice diameters and associated wall thickness was still too low to use for comparing each pottery
type/variety, with the general exception of Tchefuncte
Plain, variety Tchefuncte, Goose Creek Plain, unspecified variety, and O’Neal Plain, variety Conway.

123

In any event, when orifice diameter is consolidated and plotted for all of the early ceramics (Figure
38) it is clear that the majority of vessels of Goose
Creek Plain, unspecified variety, and the two Baytown
Plain varieties are small while the majority of O’Neal
Plain, variety Conway and the two Tchefuncte Plain
varieties are relatively larger vessels. However, while
all six type/varieties contain examples of small, medium,
and large vessels, in some cases this is merely a nominal difference. For example, three-fourths of the
Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte vessels had orifices in the 16-25 cm diameter range and the remaining
one-fourth was equally divided between larger and
smaller vessels.
Moving from size to shape, the majority (twothirds) of all recordable vessels had unrestricted upper
bodies (Table 43). This also is the case at the individual
type/variety level where the sample is large enough to
draw conclusions. For example, oriented rims of both
O’Neal Plain, variety Conway and Tchefuncte Plain,
variety Tchefuncte indicated two-thirds of the vessels
were unrestricted, while three-fourths of the Goose
Creek Plain, unspecified variety were unrestricted. Perhaps surprisingly, the proportion of all Orange Period
restricted and unrestricted vessels was the same as for
the Big Hill Period possibly suggesting that while slow
changes were underway regarding the paste characteristics of early ceramic pottery, the functionality of early
ceramic vessels was relatively stable.
Base sherds are less common than oriented rims,
but the relative proportion of all base forms in the Orange Period versus those in the Big Hill Period again is
about the same (Table 45). Flat bases are by far the
most common; noded bottoms are next most frequent;
round bottoms are even less, although these can easily
go unrecognized among body sherds; and least common of all are true conical bases. Among the flat bases,
those on the Tchefuncte Plain varieties are circular while
those on the Baytown Plain varieties are square. Another rare base feature was a single wedge-shaped podal
support found on a Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte
sherd. Interestingly, there were no flat bases on any of
the Goose Creek varieties, only round, noded and conical
forms.
Without better data on diameter, height, base
forms, and other technical features as they are combined in whole vessels it is not possible to apply much
more functional analysis to this sherd collection. However, the rim shapes and orifice diameters documented

indicate some differences in pottery assemblages. When
combined with the paste analysis reported at the
Gaulding site (Aten and Bollich 2002:39–59) indicating
fundamentally different kinds and proportions of tempering materials, occasional use of burnishing versus
often not using burnishing all suggest the early pottery
in use in the Sabine Lake area was differentiated in
design to achieve desired thermal shock resistance, vessel stability, permeability management, evaporation
management, and heating effectiveness (cf., BlakneyBailey 2004). Finally, there was almost no evidence of
sooty or charred accumulations on sherds suggesting
that during the early ceramic pottery vessels were seldom, if ever, used directly over fire for cooking. Indeed, given the absence of cobbles for stone boiling,
ceramic vessels in the Sabine may not have been used
at all for cooking but rather as storage containers for
wet and dry materials.
Lithics
A modest assemblage of largely early ceramic age
projectile points was documented in the collections reported here. The specimen distributions are reported in
the individual site descriptions and in Appendix B. The
physical distinction between dart and arrow points is
clear in the metric attributes given in Table 48. The
chronological occurrence of dart and arrow points according to the seriation of their associated collections
and their stem form is summarized in Figure 39. Contracting and straight-stemmed dart points—principally
variations of the Gary and Kent types—are abundant
in the Orange Period and then diminish in popularity in
the Big Hill Period.
The expanding stem dart points are relatively common in the Orange Period but were not found with
later collections. These are either older forms or are
styles reworked from large-stemmed Archaic points.
The abundance of earlier sites or components, as at
McFaddin Beach or at Black Hill Mound, apparently
provided later Sabine Lake Area peoples many opportunities to collect much older, and often larger, projectile points. Whether this was just out of curiosity or
was a common means of obtaining large pieces of chert
to use essentially as a preform for reworking into smaller,
contemporary point styles, is hard to say. The latter
possibility is appealing and susceptible to at least a degree of testing in the future by looking for more examples of oddly proportioned points like those here

125

called “Yarbrough-like.”
Simultaneous with the phasing out of the large
dart points, and possibly of the thrown dart that went
with them, was the appearance of arrow points. Very
few of these small points were recovered from the early
ceramic collections and all of them were from the surface or top excavation layer of their respective site which
could indicate that they were dropped there at times
later than the age of the archeological deposit, so it
should not be taken with too much certainty that arrow
points appeared in the Orange Period and possibly even
in the Big Hill Period. But bifacial lithic arrow points
would be expected to appear sometime around the Big
Hill Period. No examples of gar scales serving as projectile points or of unifacial chipped stone arrow points
were found in these collections, as has been reported
for the Galveston Bay Area (Patterson 1994).
Fortunately, some of the collections included recovery of flake tools and debris. Careful sorting of this
material led to an impression of the local biface reduction process used for preparing chipped stone tools (Figure 40). Basically it describes, based on materials in the
Sabine collections, four material sources, selection of
material to use, testing the material for suitability, reduction to preforms showing both the flakes resulting,
preforms, and preform failures. And finally it shows
the waste flakes, broken tool attempts, finished tools,
and worn out tools. The occurrence of these various
phases of the process is given in the artifact descriptions for each collection in the preceding chapters.
Other tool and non-tool assemblages
A large number of stone, bone, shell, and artifacts
of other materials were recovered from the early ceramic collections with the great majority and variety
associated with the Orange Period (Table 40). In particular, these included various forms of drill/perforators, scrapers and chopping tools, socketed bone points,
a variety of awls, and a variety of tools used for making tools, such as hammerstones of different size and
weight, pumice and sandstone for grinding and smoothing, and asphalt for cementing. Some of the Orange
Period artifacts, such as hammerstones and pitted stones,
are much worn and seem to have been curated for a
considerable time.
In addition, the Orange Period assemblage includes
rare non-tool artifacts such as a quartz crystal, slate,
bone and shell pendants, shell and bone beads, pig-

used for personal wear, or as part of medicine bundles.
While most of these artifacts were associated with the
Orange Period, the tools found in the Big Hill Period
collections had nothing like the variety of the former
assemblages, but they did continue to have basic implements such as certain chipped stone cutting, perforating, and scraping tools and simple bone awls, pumice,
and asphalt.
Whether this change in assemblage was a function of a cultural difference in available technology, or
a sampling problem is not a question that can be answered just now. However, the difference between the
Orange Period and Big Hill Period does bring to mind
the similar differences between the Clear Lake and
Mayes Island periods in the Galveston Bay Area. Thus
we cannot dismiss the difference out of hand as a sampling problem; it is an issue that should be addressed in

future research.
SUBSISTENCE
There is not much to work with for the early ceramic periods since most excavations were small and
not all included an effort to collect vertebrate bones in
a systematic fashion. But, we have to start somewhere.
The vertebrate collections, such as they are, have all
been described in the preceding chapters on their respective sites except for the Gaulding site for which
consult Aten and Bollich (2002:67–73). It should be
possible to look at the available subsistence data in a
longer chronological perspective by first sequencing the
early ceramic animal class usage trends according to
the ceramic sequence described at the beginning of this
chapter. Then the preceding subsistence trends of the
Late Archaic Taylor Bayou Period are added using the

First it should be noted that there is no a priori
reason to expect that any periods of change in subsistence trends should coincide with changes in ceramic
assemblages or diagnostic chipped stone tools that form

the basis for the area’s culture-historical framework now
under development. It is just that these diagnostic artifact assemblages are more readily observable than subsistence trends, or practically any other element of the
cultures responsible for the archeological sites being investigated. And so their diagnostic artifact sequences
are the “grid” on which other data are plotted as they
become available.
That said, there are at least two circumstances
that could affect the recovery of vertebrates in the early
ceramic: (1) the shift in the Big Hill Period from preponderant use of arm propelled darts with large chipped
stone points (weighing 5 gm on average) to bow-pro-

pelled arrows with small chipped stone points (weighing nearly 1 gm on average); and (2) the apparent low
sea level Orange Period succeeded by a higher sea level
in the Big Hill Period. A further limitation in these collections that cannot be factored into their interpretation
with any certainty is that some differences are likely to
result from the various local environments their respective sites occupied.
To review again on what is available from early
ceramic sites, the largest and most useful collection by
far is that from the Eddleman site. Its drawback is that
it was screened only through ½ inch (15 mm) mesh
and it is not currently known if a significant amount of

130

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

small faunal elements were lost that might have been
recovered using the 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) screen. This is
a matter that still can be evaluated in future visits to the
site. The next best collection is from Pipkin Ranch site
41JF31B where a 1 × 2 m test pit was excavated to a
depth of 1.1 m and was water screened through 1/16
inch (1.6 mm) mesh. Thirdly, a small, late ceramic collection obtained by screening through an unknown mesh
size was recovered at Pipkin Ranch site 41JF26.
Complementing these collections is one vertebrate assemblage that seems to be Big Hill Period in age and
three assemblages dating to the Late Archaic from the
Gaulding site.
Taken together, these collections, uncorrected for
methodological biases, appear to begin outlining the
trends of vertebrate subsistence in the Sabine Lake Area
from about 4000 years ago to approximately 1000 years
ago (Figure 41). As reflected by the number of identified specimens recovered (or NISP), the major patterns evident in the NISP recovery of the various animal classes are a significant decline in use of Large
Terrestrials (mostly white-tailed deer) and a significant
increase in Small Terrestrial-Aquatics (mostly turtles)
during the Late Archaic Taylor Bayou Period and the
initial ceramics-using Orange Period. The Orange Period was also a time when the use of Aquatics (fish),
Large Terrestrial-Aquatics (alligators), and possibly
Small Terrestrials also declined significantly and the
acquisition of birds may have increased somewhat from
their Late Archaic usage.
The limited data from the subsequent Big Hill
Period suggests a time of transition and reorganization
of vertebrate subsistence. Relative to the Orange Period, deer, alligators, and Small Terrestrial-Aquatics again
seem to increase but may decline again going into the
late ceramic. In the late ceramic, the most notable additional shift may be the rise of fish bones to be the largest number of identified specimens in the assemblage.
MORTUARY PRACTICES
The principal evidence about mortuary practices
available for the Sabine is structural. The Black Hill
Mound was built of two layers of dense earth midden
material and is circular and dome-shaped. The lower
layer may be middle Archaic aged and was penetrated
by interments at some future but probably pre-Orange
Period time. The upper layer—probably Orange Period in age—contained interments of a few individuals

possibly as early as Orange Period in age. This mound,
possibly along with one or two other similarly shaped
mounds alleged to be or have once been in the same
vicinity, was clearly intended to be a noticeable landmark, possibly as a territorial boundary, and/or as a
metaphor for secular and sacred significance in the local belief system. The individuals buried there were
accompanied by some grave goods such as shell beads
and large bone awls. It is unclear whether other materials such as a slate pendant came from graves. And still
undetermined is whether the Black Hill Mound is generically similar to the Tchefuncte culture Lafayette
Mounds.
The Dredge site, of either late Orange Period or
Big Hill Period age, is an entirely different structure.
Situated in the heart of occupied western Atakapa territory, it is an earthen cemetery platform built atop a
moderate-sized shell mound and is the place of interment of several dozen individuals. Found in this cemetery were many grave goods such as bone tools, small
ceramic vessels, a boatstone, and so on. Unusual among
the cemetery contents was interment of an apparent
trophy head—a skull placed on a large slab of sandstone.
Then, of unknown age, in very large shell mounds
along the lower Neches River, large numbers of skeletons allegedly were found mostly in the 19th Century.
Finally, in habitation sites some distance away from the
densely inhabited lower Neches, occasional burials have
been found with no recorded grave goods or ceremonial implications beyond providing a disposition other
than abandonment on the ground surface.
As recently described by Gibson “residence and
ritual were not exclusive….They coexisted” (Gibson
2001:99). Clearly some of the mortuary locations described above were both residential and ritual in nature,
although probably not simultaneously. But one has to
ask what it takes to qualify for entry into the Dredge
site cemetery; or into the Black Hill Mound. There the
abundance of grave goods and special mortuary treatments seems to imply that a particular status was required to be interred at those locations. The abundance
of skeletons apparently seen during the quarrying of
the lower Neches shell mounds suggests interment of
lower status individuals, while the occasional burial encountered in sites away from the Neches may just have
been random occurrences.
There seems to be a cultural structure here; in the
center of the heavily inhabited lower Neches River is

the cemetery for high(?) status people (i.e., Dredge site).
Elsewhere in the center the people of lesser status were
interred in large numbers into shell midden mounds.

Some people died while away from the center perhaps
on the seasonal round and were buried in those peripheral locations. And some people of a distinctive status

132

were buried in the mound on the territorial periphery
(i.e., Black Hill) to give a special or even sacred status
of some sort to the boundary mound. The structures at
both the Dredge site and Black Hill Mound bear no
resemblance to the conical Coral Snake Mound or Jonas
Short Mound, both located a hundred miles or so inland from the Sabine and of apparent Marksville age. If
there is any resemblance of Sabine mortuary sites at
all, it may be of Black Hill to the Lafayette Mounds
(Gibson 1976).
TERRITORIALITY
In 1983 a reconstruction, centered on Galveston
Bay, of probable 18th Century native territories was
published (Aten 1983:Figure 3.1). This reconstruction,
believed to approximate Galveston Bay Area tribal territories at least since the end of the Late Archaic, was
based largely on archival information and limited artifact distributions, and continues, with some minor tweaking, to be a reasonable representation of the western
margin of the region occupied by native groups representative of the Mossy Grove Tradition.
In the present study the principal change that has
been made was to move the northern boundary of the
western Atakapa southward to the vicinity of Pine Island Bayou and to speculate that the eastern boundary
of the western Atakapa tribe probably is just on the
east side of the Calcasieu River (Figure 1). There is
very little evidence for this but, again, we have to start
somewhere as a guide to searching for more convincing information. The principal artifact distributions sug-

gestive about this are such things as Neuman’s documentation of complicated stamped sherds in south Louisiana where most, if not all, are from east of the
Calcasieu (Neuman 1981); and the absence of Late
Prehistoric earthen mounds west of the Mermentau River
for the most part (McBride et al. 1997:55). In general,
an eastern boundary of the western Atakapa somewhere
between the Calcasieu River and Mermentau River
seems a reasonable likelihood.
Black earth middens and shell-bearing sites continue in use to the westward as typical habitation debris. What is surprising in the Sabine is the black earth
midden, of Middle Archaic and Orange Period ages,
serving also as a mortuary mound, and the Big Hill
Period earthen mortuary platform built atop a shell
mound. Such mounds, decidedly less impressive than
conical mounds, may just have been overlooked to the
present time in the intervening Calcasieu part of the
western Atakapa territory. In the Galveston Bay Area
intensive and extensive site survey has never turned up
anything comparable to these two mortuary mounds in
the Sabine.
Taken together there is an image of complex ceremonialism in the eastern Atakapa territory, much less
complexity in at least the Sabine part of the western
Atakapa territory, and even less complexity in the mortuary ritual of the Galveston Bay Area and the territory
of the Akokisa. These circumstances further suggest
that the Mossy Grove Tradition may encompass the
final marginal dilution of southeastern U.S. Native
American culture at its southwest or coastal limit.

Appendix A

SABINE LAKE AREA EARLY CERAMICS

INTRODUCTION
To avoid unnecessary repetition in the preceding
site chapters, all the ceramic category descriptions and
illustrations are provided in this appendix. The basic
descriptions and rationale of the southeast Texas typology may be found in Aten (1983:206–245) with more
recent developments as reviewed in Aten and Bollich
(2002:39–57), Ensor (1995:185–202; 1998), Phillips
(1970), Weinstein and Rivet (1978), and Weinstein et
al. (1988:37–39). In particular, the paste characteristics
of all the major wares have been described in detail in
Aten and Bollich (1969; 2002) and Ensor (1998). The
following appendix stresses keys to identifying and classifying the greater variety of early ceramics that are
found in the Sabine compared to those in the Galveston
Bay Area.
The approach to classifying southeast Texas and
Sabine Lake Area sherds used in recent years is the
type-variety system as developed for the Lower Mississippi Valley (Phillips 1970:24–28). The type-variety
system of classification is relatively straightforward. A
ceramic “type” is a generally unmistakable combination of physical, temporal, and spatial attributes that
allows one to distinguish and classify substantially all of
a collection into mutually exclusive categories. Within a
collection of sherds of a particular type, though, it is
not unusual to encounter specimens that, while clearly
belonging to the type, tend to vary in ways that are not
nearly as uniform as, or coterminous with the type’s
characteristics and distribution. This variation may be
due to firing, tempering, clay sources, vessel forming
characteristics, design motifs, or practically any other
time, space, or physical feature that stands out in a
collection. Some of these tendencies to variation within
a type may be more formally recognized as a “variety”
provided their recognition conveys information about

the cultures under investigation.
Varieties are not “small types.” Types are mutually exclusive while varieties identify less distinctive distributional or physical tendencies. Whether one should
bother defining a minor tendency as a variety depends
on whether any useful research meaning can be assigned to it. For example, the meaning of Goose Creek
Plain, variety Anahuac, when originally defined (Aten
1983:232), was that it was expected to assist in tracing
the relationship, possibly an evolutionary one, between
Tchefuncte and Goose Creek pottery types. Whether
this will be the case still remains to be seen (but see
Ensor et al. 1998); however, it would be impractical to
use the variety Anahuac as a type because while it
usually can be distinguished, there often can be difficulty in consistently distinguishing some sherds from
either the remainder of Goose Creek Plain or from
Tchefuncte Plain, variety Mandeville.
Certain other aspects of how the type/variety system is used here may be somewhat more conservative
than as originally described by Phillips (1970:24–28)
but do not really deviate from the principles as he described them. For example, most Goose Creek Plain
sherds from the Sabine Lake Area and from the nearby
lower Trinity River are indistinguishable and so naming
two varieties based only on that geography is not useful. It would just clutter up the nomenclature. However, in the lower Trinity River sites there is an anecdotally noted tendency for Goose Creek Plain in the
early periods to be soft and highly oxidized while in the
later periods for it to be harder and dark colored. These
observations might have implications for hypotheses
about the development of pottery technology in that
location that could be clarified by using some carefully
formulated varieties to help map the key characteristics; this has not yet been done, although an initial attempt was made by Ambler (1973).

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

Another basis for varieties often is to recognize a
significant discontinuity in their spatial distribution. That
generally has not been the practice in the Sabine unless
there are other reinforcing differences as well. Thus
there presently is no uniform basis in sherd collections
to distinguish between Tchefuncte Plain, variety
Tchefuncte from southeastern Louisiana and what has
been called by the same name in the Sabine except,
perhaps, a slight tendency in the latter toward more
silty paste. In the northern Gulf coast, a common geographic discontinuity in ceramic data is between the
Sabine and south-central Louisiana, but this may be
largely a sampling deficiency inasmuch as relatively little
research has been done in the coastal prairies of southwestern Louisiana. So, sherds found in the Sabine that
are substantially identical to varieties recorded in southcentral Louisiana are classified into the same type and
variety.
The practice here is to define varieties only when
and where specific characteristics serve analytical needs.
There are times, particularly involving plainware, when
not all sherds are assigned to a variety. In this case, the
type name is followed by the term “unspecified variety,” which obviously is not a variety, but rather is the
absence of any defined systematic variation within a
type. It is classification based solely on the typological
criteria. And so, for Goose Creek Plain, a type for which
much anecdotal time, space, and technological variation is known even if these have not been formalized
through analysis, most sherds of that type in the Sabine
Lake Area are left as “unspecified variety” except for
the minor variety, variety Anahuac. To append a single
variety name to such a large and diverse ware would
only confuse and complicate matters at some later time
when new research questions probably will indicate
additional attribute combinations within the type that
are useful to distinguish.
In cases where there are only a few specimens of
an unnamed type/variety but there is clear understanding of its nature, new type and variety names are given.
For example, there are only a few sherds in the collections from incised or red-filmed sand-tempered vessels. But all major early ceramic plainwares in this region are accompanied at least by an incised, and a redfilmed version. The sand-tempered sherds mentioned
above are clearly counterparts to the abundant O’Neal
Plain, variety Conway and so these new, aberrant, sherds
have been named Conway Incised, variety Cove and
Conway Red-filmed, variety Conway.

Because there are a number of minor types
present that are relatively uniform in their appearance
and distribution in southeast Texas, the concept of “established variety” is employed (Phillips 1970:35). Examples of this would be Goose Creek Incised, variety
Goose Creek and Goose Creek Red-Filmed, variety
Goose Creek.
In other cases where the type is recognizable but
other features are too fragmentary or indistinct to identify, these have been called an “unidentified variety.”
An example of this is sherds incised with wide, U-shaped
lines typical of Marksville Incised or Stamped, but the
sherds are too small to indicate whether they included
stamping.
There also are instances of sherds that cannot at
this time be associated with any existing type or variety, and are not sufficiently abundant to be defined as a
type in their own right; these sherds are left with informal names as a “descriptive category.” Common examples are the mixed tempering plainwares the significance of whose minor but ubiquitous occurrence is not
presently understood.
In sum, a variety should usually be created to
serve a research issue, as in the case of variety Anahuac,
or to aid in partitioning the time or space distribution of
a pervasive type as, for instance, in the case of Baytown
Plain. In the present study the types begin to show the
extent to which lower Mississippi valley early ceramics, or the formal concepts behind them, spread westward and, possibly to a lesser degree, the eastward drift
of some southeast Texas forms along the northern Gulf
coast. The varieties, however, suggest the extent to which
that spread was accompanied by social or technological
forces that caused some familiar types (from the perspective of where they were first recognized and described) to begin to drift from their typical forms.
Whether a type or a variety recognizes the folk
classifications of prehistoric potters is something we
are unlikely to ever know much about. While some of
the types used here may, in part, reflect prehistoric
manufacturing and use objectives, archeological classification usually is based on only a few sherd characteristics. But the native potter’s concept (or type) more
likely reflected the whole vessel that was the expected
result of the manufacturing process. Insofar as intended
use would determine clay, temper, form, design, and
firing procedure, presumably these would all be integrated into the folk classification in a way that is difficult to identify today.

Appendix A: Sabine Lake Area Early Ceramics

So, types are used to subdivide an entire collection; varieties add flexibility by recognizing tendencies
of variation within types and cause or enable us to ask
questions about why this was so. And finally, we recognize that certain treatments of vessels cut across both
types and varieties. These are modes (cf. Phillips
1970:28–29) and in the Sabine Lake Area constitute
such things as noded or perforated rims, red-filming,
and perhaps certain kinds of incising and rocker stamping.
Any verbal references to grain size in the following descriptions are to the Wentworth scale while references to color are to the Munsell scale unless otherwise
noted. As many sherds as possible are illustrated in Figures 42 to 47. Table 41 may be used as an index to
identify the sites at which particular ceramic taxa were
found, illustrated or not. An index to site provenience
for all the illustrated sherds is given in Table 42. More
specific provenience information can be found in the
chapter pertaining to the site in question. To facilitate
using the following descriptions, as well as the individual provenience tables in the separate site chapters,
the lists of ceramic types and varieties are placed in the
same order as in Table 42.
Finally, there is the matter of vessel form. In the
recent report on excavations at the Gaulding site (Aten
and Bollich 2002) emphasis in ceramics analysis was
placed on an initial attempt at quantifying the differences in sedimentary characteristics of the major paste
categories as they occur in the Sabine. In the present
investigation, given the larger number of sherds available for study, emphasis in ceramics analysis was placed
on classification and on identifying certain vessel form
characteristics. But, with the exception of a single
Tchefuncte Plain vessel whose form and dimensions
were reconstructed by Bollich (Figure 43), the vessel
analysis had to be limited to information from sherds.
This included oriented rims from which were estimated
orifice diameter, orientation of the upper vessel rim,
and wall thickness; in addition any sherds illustrating
base shapes were recorded. The range of vessel shapes
implied by the various oriented rims in these Sabine
collections is illustrated in Figure 48. The number of
instances of vessel information was small in any of the
individual collections and so the data were aggregated
by type/variety (Figures 44, 45, and 46) for use in the
following descriptions, and in other combinations for
use in the conclusions chapter of this initial exploration
of early ceramics in the Sabine. However, because there

141

was essentially no data on complete vessels with which
to work in differentiating types and varieties, the critical sorting criteria in the following descriptions were
pastes and design features.
CERAMIC DESCRIPTIONS
Untempered Clay Paste Wares
Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte (Figure 42, A)
Sorting criteria. This variety was established
originally on the collections from the Tchefuncte sites
in the Ponchartrain basin (Ford and Quimby 1945;
Phillips 1970:162–163). Recognition usually is based
on the thick vessel wall, contorted silty clay paste texture, poor coil wedging, and sometimes the spalling of
the clay surface. Typically the rims are irregularly shaped
and often the wall exterior is indented with numerous
tool marks.
Following this, the paste of variety Tchefuncte
should not have grain sizes larger than silt whereas variety Mandeville is a sandy paste ware and should have
relatively abundant sand in the very fine and fine grain
sizes. Sand sizes larger than this bring Goose Creek
Plain or O’Neal Plain into consideration. But an occasional sand grain in an otherwise clay or silty paste
should not tempt one to place Tchefuncte sherds in the
Mandeville variety. These relationships can be readily
seen graphically in the paste analyses reported at the
Gaulding site (Aten and Bollich 2002:Figure 17; Table
3). In the Sabine, though, there is a greater use of silty
clays often giving variety Tchefuncte sherds a somewhat grittier feel rather than the powdery feel more
typical of similar sherds in south-central Louisiana.
Certain other distinctions can be noted at the level
of the vessel assemblage insofar as this is evident in
sherd collections. First, the only evidence of the shape
of an entire flat-based and restricted orifice vessel in
the Sabine early ceramic collections was reconstructed
by Bollich from variety Tchefuncte sherds (Figure 43)
collected toward the south end of Conway D
(16CU108). This small collection was not used in the
seriation reported in Chapter 2 but is believed by Bollich
to be of similar or earlier provenience to the radiocarbon date from this site (cf. Table 1). Beyond the Conway
D vessel, some 20 oriented rims of Tchefuncte Plain,
variety Tchefuncte, were documented in the seriated
collections, with the majority from Orange Period col-

lections. Two-thirds of the latter and all oriented rims
from the Big Hill Period were from unrestricted vessels—usually jar forms (Table 43)—apparently of several kinds similar to those illustrated from the Resch
site (Webb et al. 1969). Of the Orange Period vessels,
the majority also were in the 16 to 25 cm orifice diameter group; Big Hill Period rims were divided between
the 16 to 25 cm and the >25 cm groups but were too
few in number to draw conclusions (Table 44). Few
bases were recovered (Table 45) but most were flat;
one was noded and a single wedge-shaped podal support was recorded. From one of the unreported collec-

tions—the south end of 16CU108—was found a fragment of a semi-annular ring base, one with notches or
flutes. All of these are typical of Tchefuncte ceramics
to the east, but they may be in reduced proportions in
the Sabine Lake Area leaving circular flat bases as the
principal form.
Local distribution. This variety appears to have
a continuous distribution across south Louisiana and
reaching into coastal Texas as far as just west of
Galveston Bay (Aten 1983; Weinstein 1986). In the
Sabine it is found in greatest relative abundance at Orange Period sites and in small, consistently diminishing

quantities at Big Hill Period sites (Figure 4). It is found
less consistently and in smaller quantities at Clear Lake
Period sites in the Galveston Bay Area.
Tchefuncte Incised, variety Tchefuncte (Figure 42,
B)
Sorting criteria. This sherd is essentially identical to the paste and design attributes of the type as
originally described (Ford and Quimby 1945:58; Phillips
1970:162); no vessel attributes except wall thickness
are observable. The paste is soft, has a powdery feel to
the surface, and has irregular wedging and smoothing
of the coils. The preserved part of the design motif is
precisely executed and appears to be diagonal incised
lines bounded by a horizontal line forming a band probably around the rim. An unusual feature is use of triangular punctations apparently forming part of the design.
Local distribution. This variety probably extends
continuously across south Louisiana at least as far as
the Sabine Lake Area; it has not yet been reported farther west. The Sabine Lake occurrence is in the early
Orange Period.
Tchefuncte Incised, variety Goose Creek (Figure
42, C–E)
Sorting criteria. The paste of these sherds ranges
from the soft clay texture typical of south Louisiana
Tchefuncte to coarse silt and very fine sandy paste reminiscent of Tchefuncte Plain, variety Mandeville or even
Goose Creek Plain, variety Anahuac. Rims are typically irregular and vessel walls are uneven and poorly
formed. One of the rims can be oriented and indicates
it is a small, unrestricted vessel (Tables 43, 44). The
lips of two vessels (Figure 42, D–E) are rudely scalloped, and wall thicknesses range from 5 to 8 mm. The
incised designs just below the rim are roughly executed
sets of from two to six roughly parallel lines. They are

reminiscent of straight line geometric designs as often
executed on indigenous southeast Texas Goose Creek
Incised and San Jacinto Incised (cf. Figures 45, H–J
and 47, H–K). One sherd (Figure 42, E) has three even
more irregular lines traced around the interior of the
rim.
These simple incised designs are consistent with
those found in the more or less contemporaneous Clear
Lake and Mayes Island Periods in the Galveston Bay
Area (Aten 1983:Figure 12.2), although most previously
reported examples of interior incising in the Galveston
Bay Area are from more recent time periods (cf. Neyland
and Aten 1971). On the whole, the paste of these sherds
is more suggestive of Tchefuncte while the crudely executed incising is most suggestive of early Goose Creek
Incised, variety Goose Creek (cf. Aten 1983:Figure
12.2). One probably could argue that rather than see
these as a form of Tchefuncte pottery that they might
be an incised version of Goose Creek variety Anahuac
as was recognized in the Eagle’s Ridge site analysis
(Ensor 1998:276). However, given the greater weight
assigned to paste characteristics in the southeast TexasSabine Lake Area ceramic classification, the combination here of two well-known features—Tchefuncte paste
and Goose Creek Incised design motif—has caused us
to distinguish these sherds as a local variety of Tchefuncte
Incised.
Local distribution. This specific attribute combination is only reported, so far, from two early Orange
Period sites (Table 42) in the Sabine Lake Area. However, the paste and design features involved are separately characteristic of both the Sabine and the Galveston
Bay areas.
Tchefuncte Incised, unidentified variety
Sorting criteria. This is a very small incised sherd
with the characteristic fine and soft Tchefuncte paste.
On the exterior there are remnants of three incised lines
oriented parallel to the coil wedging indicating this part

of the design motif was of a set of horizontal parallel
lines. The incised lines are flat-bottomed rather than Vshaped as is usually the case. We cannot rule out the

possibility that this small sherd was from a Lake Borgne
Incised vessel, although there is no indication of drag
and jab design execution. The sherd is too small to

conclude whether it is similar to or different from any
other recognized type or variety, other than its general
Tchefuncte Incised affiliation, and it is not illustrated.
Local distribution. This sherd was found at an
Orange Period Sabine area site (Table 42).
Tchefuncte Stamped, variety Tchefuncte (Figure 42,
F–F’)
Sorting criteria. These sherds have a typical
Tchefuncte paste with the exterior decorated with rows
of a curved, plain rocker stamp very lightly indented
into the clay (Figure 42, F–F’). The superficial indentations of the rocker stamp are hard to see and attempts
to photograph them were largely unsuccessful. However, the design and execution is similar to that on Goose

Creek Stamped, variety Goose Creek, as illustrated in
Figure 45, B and Aten (1983:Figure 12.5a, b and d),
and Tchefuncte Stamped, variety Tchefuncte (Aten
1983:Figure 12.5c and g; Ensor 1998:254). The stamping looks more like Tchefuncte Stamped, variety Big
Oak, as proposed by R. Shenkel but in more recent
work the latter has been recombined with another variety under variety Tchefuncte which usage is followed
here (Weinstein and Rivet 1978:46–47).
Local distribution. This plain, curved stamping
is found on Tchefuncte paste from the Ponchartrain
area west to Galveston Bay. In southeast Texas the
design also is found on the sandy Goose Creek paste.
Chronologically, in the Sabine it occurs in the Orange
Period; in Galveston Bay it is confined to the Clear
Lake Period.

Tchefuncte Stamped, variety Cow Bayou (Figure
42, G)
Sorting criteria. This sherd has the characteristic
fine, soft Tchefuncte paste with a relatively thin, circa
5 mm, vessel wall. Some part of the vessel surface is
covered with dentate rocker-stamping although there is
not enough remaining to identify zoning. The stamp is
about 1 cm long with about 10 “teeth” or points evident and the impression is made firmly into the exterior
vessel surface. The established variety, Tchefuncte
Stamped, variety Tchefuncte, usually employs a smooth,

curved, rocker stamp or a forked stamp (Phillips
1970:164–165). A dentate rocker-stamp—variety Vermilion—is reported from most Tchula Period sites in
south-central Louisiana locations (Gibson 1976:33;
Weinstein and Rivet 1978:50–51), but this variety has
only two or three points on the stamping tool. Because
of the significant spatial separation and elaboration of
the stamping tool, the variety name Cow Bayou is tentatively used here to signify this local variation.
Local distribution. The Cow Bayou variety of
Tchefuncte Stamped is only recorded from the early
Orange Period of the Sabine Lake Area (Table 42).
However, similar multiple dentate rocker-stamping is
now known across the coastal marshes from southcentral Louisiana west to the Texas-Louisiana boundary. This new variety is named after a Texas tributary
of the Sabine River located 4.5 km upstream from the
river’s mouth; see the USGS Orange Quadrangle, Louisiana-Texas.

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

Tchefuncte Perforated, variety Sabine (Figure 44,
E–H)
Sorting criteria. These sherds are of typical soft
Tchefuncte paste with a single row of perforations
around the rim at 5 to 10 mm below the lip. Perforations are executed in two ways: treatment one consists
of small perforations about 2-3 mm in diameter made
from both the exterior and from the interior nearly, but
not all of the way, through the wall thickness; the interior and exterior perforations are not aligned and usually do not connect; treatment two consists of larger
perforations about 4 mm in diameter made from the
interior penetrating the entire wall thickness usually resulting in an open hole through the vessel wall, but
occasionally producing an exterior node or partial node
with a small hole in the center. Most perforations are
made with a round tool, but some are made with a flat
tool. Nodes do break off some sherds leaving an open
perforation through the vessel wall, but this is rarely
the case with variety Sabine. Sherds with open perforations should be examined for scars left in the event
there were nodes that have broken off.
The variety Sabine perforations may have been
an outgrowth of the technique for making nodes which
was employed occasionally on the exterior rim of vessels from northern Alabama (Alexander Series), the
Ponchartrain area (Alexander Pinched; O’Neal Plain),
and the Yazoo (Tchefuncte Plain, variety Sky Lake), as
well as in the Sabine Lake Area (Goose Creek Plain,
unspecified variety; O’Neal Plain, variety Conway).
However, perforated rims as an intended result apparently have not yet been reported in any of these areas
except the Sabine and variety Sabine treatments should
not be mistaken for a consequence of creating rim
nodes.
Local distribution. Perforated Tchefuncte rims
are only known from the early Orange Period Eddleman
site (41OR49) in the Sabine Lake Area at present. A
sandy paste rim with a more complex array of perforations was also found in Big Hill Period deposits at Pipkin
Ranch and is described elsewhere in this appendix. This
new local variety is named for the Sabine River.
Lake Borgne Incised, variety Cross Bayou (Figure
42, I–K)
Sorting criteria. These sherds have a paste identical to Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte and an

exterior surface decoration consisting of at least three
horizontal bands, each band made of a double row of
slanted, drag and jab punctations. The single rim sherd
recovered is too small to determine if the vessel form
was restricted or unrestricted, but the rim is thickened
on the interior by a folded over strap of clay that was
smoothly welded to the vessel wall, a treatment similar
to that used on the Lake Borgne Incised, variety Lake
Borgne described below. The vessel wall is about 5.7
mm thick. The first design band begins 13 mm below
the lip; the bands are approximately 6 mm wide and
separated from the next lower band by an unmodified
strip some 5-6 mm wide. The design was executed with
a large pointed instrument about 3 mm in diameter.
The tool was held at an acute angle to the clay surface,
jabbed backward into the clay, then moved forward
and jabbed back again. Sometimes the tool was dragged
producing an indented groove, while at other times the
tool was lifted clear of the clay surface.
Local distribution. These sherds are indistinguishable from similarly classified sherds at Beau Mire
(Weinstein and Rivet 1978:66, 68–69) and south central Louisiana (Gibson 1976:33). Presumably the variety was distributed westward along the Louisiana coast
as far as the Sabine Lake Area. In the Sabine it has
only been found in one early Orange Period site (Table
42).
Lake Borgne Incised, variety Lake Borgne (Figure
44, I–J)
Sorting criteria. Two vessels appear to be represented, both with paste typical of Tchefuncte Plain,
variety Tchefuncte, and bearing fragments of drag and
jab designs. The rim sherd (Figure 44, I), apparently
from a restricted vessel form, is thickened by a clay
strap that is folded over and welded smoothly to the
interior surface; vessel wall thickness was 9 mm. Only
the part of the design nearest the rim can be seen, and
consists of two rows of wide drag and jab impressions
running parallel to the vessel lip. The illustrated body
sherd (Figure 44, J) has a wall thickness of 7-8 mm and
displays several nested curvilinear rows of drag and jab
incisions made with a small pointed stylus. A second
body sherd (not illustrated), possibly from the same
vessel, bears a small section of straight line drag and
jab incision similar in size to the curvilinear incisions
described above. As far as they can be observed, these
sherds are essentially identical to the paste and design

Appendix A: Sabine Lake Area Early Ceramics

attributes of Lake Borgne Incised as originally described
(Ford and Quimby 1945:58; Weinstein and Rivet
1978:64–68).
Local distribution. The sherds described here are
all from the early Orange Period Eddleman site, the
most westward occurrence of the type yet reported.
They are common in south-central Louisiana (Gibson
1976) and eastward. Despite the geographic gap, the
absence of new distinguishing features has caused retention of the original variety name.
Tammany Punctated, unidentified variety (Figure
44, D)

155

is about 8 mm thick. The design consists of a band of
vertical drag and jab punctations highlighting the rim.
Below this a band of large diamonds formed of plain
incised lines and filled with linear drag and jab punctations wrap around the vessel’s circumference about a
centimeter below the lip. Characteristics of this sherd
match Gibson’s description of variety Magenta
(1976:34).
Local distribution. This sherd is from the early
Orange Period Eddleman site. It has not been found
west of the Sabine nor to the east until reaching southcentral Louisiana.
Orleans Punctated, variety Orleans (Figure

Sorting criteria. This sherd has a clay paste similar to Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte, and a design with at least four horizontal rows of ridges pinched
up by thumb and forefinger interrupted periodically by
unmodified vessel wall. Vessel wall thickness is 6.5 mm.
Design motif may be comparable to variety Ruth Canal reported in south-central Louisiana (Gibson 1976:33,
48). Since there is only one somewhat ill-defined body
sherd in hand at the moment and limited comparative
information on variety Ruth Canal, neither that name
nor a new variety name are used at this time.
Local distribution. Found in the early Orange Period Eddleman site. The nearest reported comparable
sherds may be from south-central Louisiana.
Orleans Punctated, variety Boothe (Figure 44, B–
C)

44, A)
Sorting criteria. This sherd has a paste typical of
Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte, and a wall thickness of about 6.5 mm. The design pattern is outlined
by simple incised lines with alternating zones filled with
linear punctations made with a pointed, round tool 2
mm in diameter. This motif is typical of Orleans
Punctated as originally defined (Ford and Quimby
1945:62–63; also see Weinstein and Rivet 1978:71–74,
and Gibson 1976:34).
Local distribution. This sherd is from the early
Orange Period Eddleman site. Like the other Orleans
Punctated sherds, they have not been found west of
the Sabine nor east until reaching south-central Louisiana (Gibson 1976).
Untempered, Sandy Paste Wares

Sorting criteria. The paste is typical of
Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte, although the vessel
wall is thin (circa 5 mm). The curvilinear incised lines
on these worn sherds alternately widen and narrow indicating they were executed by the drag and jab technique. Alternating zones were then filled with round
punctations. These are characteristics of variety Boothe
(Gibson 1976:34; Weinstein and Rivet 1978:73–75).
Local distribution. These sherds were found in
the early Orange Period Eddleman site. They have not
been found west of the Sabine or east of it until reaching south-central and southeastern Louisiana.
Orleans Punctated, variety Magenta (Figure 42, H)
Sorting criteria. The paste of this sherd is typical
of Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte; the vessel wall

Tchefuncte Plain, variety Mandeville (Figure 44,
K–L)
Sorting criteria. This variety is reminiscent of
Tchefuncte Plain, variety Tchefuncte, in all respects
except the degree of sand in the paste. While variety
Tchefuncte in the Sabine often has coarse silt in the
clay, rendering a gritty feel to the clay, variety
Mandeville will have considerable amounts of very finegrained sand; see Aten and Bollich (2002:41) for a recent detailed analysis of Sabine Lake Area Mandeville
plainware. Beyond this distinction, variety Mandeville
is similar to variety Tchefuncte in having poorly wedged
coils, abundant voids in the paste, irregular wall thickness, and poor smoothing frequently leaving tool marks
(Figure 44, K–L). Fewer variety Mandeville than va-

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

riety Tchefuncte oriented rims were found from which
to estimate vessel forms. Of these, most were unrestricted and only flat bases were seen. All orifice size
categories were represented but the majority had medium diameters (Tables 43 through 45).
Local distribution. Variety Mandeville is found
at nearly all Orange and Big Hill Period sites and becomes especially prominent in the late Orange Period
to early Big Hill Period. It also is relatively common
westward in the roughly contemporaneous Clear Lake
Period of the Galveston Bay Area (Aten 1983:283; Ensor
1998:303–307). To the east it is abundant in the
Ponchartrain Basin while its presence in the intervening Louisiana coastal zone is not very clear (cf.
Weinstein and Rivet 1978:26–30).
Goose Creek Plain, variety Anahuac
Sorting criteria. This class identifies sherds with
paste characteristics primarily reflecting Goose Creek
Plain, unspecified variety augmented by distinctive
Tchefuncte Plain features (Aten 1983:232; see Aten
and Bollich 2002:48–49 for a recent discussion; also
Ensor 1998:307–312). For example, a vessel may have
a homogeneous sandy paste texture combined with features reminiscent of variety Mandeville such as thick
walls, or poorly wedged coils, or other trait combinations. Oriented rims (Table 43) indicate both unrestricted
and restricted vessels were made. Because of the early
occurrence of this variety, its distribution may suggest
an evolutionary relationship between Tchefuncte pastes
and Goose Creek pastes (Ensor 1998:307–312).
Local distribution. In the Sabine, variety Anahuac
primarily occurs in the Orange Period and the early
part of Big Hill Period, more or less congruent with the
history of Tchefuncte Plain, variety Mandeville. It also
is common to the west in the Clear Lake Period of the
Galveston Bay Area.
Goose Creek Plain, unspecified variety
Sorting criteria. Goose Creek Plain, unspecified
variety, is one of the most common ceramics in southeast Texas-southwest Louisiana. Its paste is thought to
be prepared from naturally occurring sandy clay, with
the latter usually predominantly containing fine to very
fine grained sands (Aten and Bollich 2002:42–49). There
is some variability in workmanship but generally the
coils are well wedged and the walls are of only moder-

ate thickness. A larger number of oriented Goose Creek
Plain rims were recovered than for most ceramic categories reported here. Two-thirds to three-fourths of
these were unrestricted vessels in both the Orange and
the Big Hill periods (Table 43) and the majority of these
had small (less than 16 cm) orifice diameters (Table
44). All of the bases found were the typical noded,
conical, or rounded forms; no bases were flat (Table
45).
Among sherds found in the Sabine displaying the
modal treatment of rim nodes, one sherd is Goose Creek
Plain, unspecified variety, with a double row of nodes
recovered from a Big Hill Period context (Figure 45,
A–A’). This sherd is unusual in that it has a double
row of nodes and because the nodes line the vessel
interior with open holes left on the exterior where a
rod-shaped tool was pressed into the soft clay. This
possibly indicates that the significant feature on vessels
treated in this manner was not the rim nodes or bosses,
but rather the holes and may relate them also to the
through-the-wall perforations reported elsewhere in this
appendix on clay paste, sandy paste, and sand-tempered ceramics.
Goose Creek Plain, unspecified variety, is terminology used here to refer to all representatives of this
type except for variety Anahuac. Our preference for
not defining an established variety name for such a ubiquitous ceramic as Goose Creek Plain is rooted in Phillips’
(1970:27) advice that if a classification does not serve
an analytical purpose, it is sufficient to use the type
name followed by “variety unspecified.”
Sherds of the type Goose Creek Plain vary widely
in physical characteristics over their time and space
range, not unlike Baytown Plain. In the case of Baytown,
however, two local varieties have been recognized (variety San Jacinto and variety Phoenix Lake) that so
far have been used in several southeast Texas locations
to document the historical interaction between lower
Mississippi valley grog-tempered technology and that
used by peripheral tribes throughout the region of the
Mossy Grove Tradition (cf., Aten 1983:Figure 15.1).
Except for trying to clarify a relationship between Goose
Creek Plain, variety Anahuac, and Tchefuncte technology, no such basic questions have been defined yet
that would be documented, tested, and clarified by a
classification of varieties subdividing Goose Creek Plain.
So, to call all Goose Creek Plain sherds, other
than variety Anahuac, by a single variety name is only
to call the type by a variety name as well. This is un-

Appendix A: Sabine Lake Area Early Ceramics

157

like, say, Goose Creek Incised or Goose Creek RedFilmed for which an established variety appears to mean
something; i.e., that little or no variation occurs in their
distribution.
Local distribution. Goose Creek Plain, unspecified variety, can be found in large quantities in all areas
of southeast Texas at least as far west as the lower
Brazos Valley and eastward into southwest Louisiana
and, chronologically, from the initial appearance of ceramics continuously to the historic period; proportions
and associations do vary, however. In the Sabine, Goose
Creek Plain comprises 15 to 20 percent of the Orange
Period ceramic assemblage and slowly increases to 30
to 40 percent in the Big Hill Period. Unlike in the
Galveston Bay Area and other locations to the west
where Goose Creek Plain is usually the predominant
ware (Aten 1983:282–293), in the Sabine, Goose Creek
Plain is usually subordinate in abundance to other wares
such as Baytown Plain and Tchefuncte Plain.

just below the vessel rim. The designs encountered in
the early ceramics sites of the Sabine are similar to
those found at early sites in the Galveston Bay Area
(Aten 1983:Figure 12.2). The few Goose Creek Incised, variety Goose Creek, oriented rims from the
Sabine mainly indicate small, unrestricted vessels (Tables
43, 44); no base forms were recovered. Goose Creek
Incised sherds, while often found, are not abundant in
southeast Texas and, as suggested by the similarity in
design motifs with early Galveston Bay examples, do
not display much spatial variation. Thus, the use of an
established variety here seems reasonable.
Local distribution. In the Sabine collections,
Goose Creek Incised, variety Goose Creek, is found in
late Orange Period sites and continues on through several of the Big Hill Period sites and, of course, to postearly ceramic sites.

Goose Creek Stamped, variety Goose Creek
(Figure 45, B)

Sorting criteria. These sherds have a typical
Goose Creek sandy paste with no sign of grog inclusions. They also display the unmistakable U-shaped
incised lines typical of Marksville Incised or Stamped.
However the sherds are too small to show whether or
not any of the zones are roughened with stamping. Nevertheless, one of the features of the Sabine early ceramics is the migration of design techniques from
Marksville Incised and Stamped vessels to local ceramics made on sandy paste, and sandy or clay pastes with
grog-tempering. To facilitate documenting the “wandering” of these indisputable Marksville design attributes
as they appear far to the west in the Sabine, the sherds
usually are carried here as a named variety. On the
illustrated rim sherd the initial U-shaped line is placed
13 mm below and parallel to the rim. The wall thickness of both sherds is 4.6 mm.
Local distribution. These sherds are from the
early Orange Period Eddleman site. The variety name
is after the Neches River.

Sorting criteria. This example has the sandy
Goose Creek paste, with a wall thickness of from 6 to
7 mm, and is adorned with simple, often faint, rocker
stamping. It resembles and is probably inspired by
Tchefuncte Stamped, varieties of which are also found
in both the Sabine Lake and Galveston Bay Areas.
Local distribution. This variety was originally
defined from several occurrences in Clear Lake Period
deposits in the Galveston Bay Area (Aten 1983:234). It
has been found only at a single early Orange Period site
in the Sabine. It has not been reported in south-central
Louisiana Tchefuncte collections and is probably a western variation on the Tchefuncte Stamped. Because of
the similarity of the Sabine sherd to the Galveston Bay
examples there probably is limited variation in execution of this concept in southeast Texas and the established variety name Goose Creek is applied to them all.
Goose Creek Incised, variety Goose Creek (Figure
45, G–J)
Sorting criteria. This variety has the same generally sandy paste character as the Goose Creek Plain,
unspecified variety. It is distinguished, in the early ceramic periods, by simple geometric straight-line incised
designs. These usually are confined to a narrow band

Goose Creek Incised, variety Neches (Figure 45, F)

Goose Creek Red-Filmed, variety Goose Creek
Sorting criteria. This type is made on the same
paste characteristics as Goose Creek Plain, unspecified
variety. Like the Goose Creek Incised, variety Goose
Creek, this type is encountered relatively often in southeast Texas but in very small numbers, and the physical
characteristics are not greatly different over the region,

158

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

thus the use of an established variety name. Occasionally one will find an incised sherd with red wash, but
not often, and not in the present collections. The redfilming, usually a wash, is fragile and can easily be removed when cleaning and cataloging sherds. Presumably this fragility was also the situation when such vessels were used and so it seems unlikely they were made
for general utilitarian purposes but rather for some special and rare occasion. At this time we can go no further in speculating on the role of red-filmed vessels in
Mossy Grove societies.
Local distribution. In the Sabine early ceramic
sites, Goose Creek Red-Filmed, variety Goose Creek,
is found in late Orange Period and in Big Hill Period
sites, and presumably in later sites as well. This is similar to its distribution elsewhere in southeast Texas (Aten
1983:282–293).
Orleans Punctated, variety Hickory Cove (Figure
45, D–E)
Sorting criteria. This new variety has a fine to
very fine sandy paste typical of Tchefuncte Plain, variety Mandeville, rather than the soft, clay paste of the
previously described examples of Orleans Punctated.
One or two small vessels are represented and wall thickness ranges from 5.5 to 6 mm. The design motif is
complex and uses chevrons, cross-hatching, and pendant triangles the latter filled with randomly applied
punctations made with a very small diameter (< 1 mm)
tool. Simple incised lines were used to outline the design pattern.
Local distribution. None of the Orleans Punctated
varieties has been found west of the Sabine Lake Area.
Neither has one quite like variety Hickory Cove been
reported among the Orleans Punctated varieties found
in south-central and southeastern Louisiana (Gibson
1976; Weinstein and Rivet 1978:71–75). These sherds
were found in the early Orange Period Eddleman site.
The variety name, Hickory Cove, is taken from a small
cove on the north shore of Sabine Lake immediately
west of the mouth of Sabine River; see the USGS West
of Greens Bayou Quadrangle, Texas-Louisiana.
Sandy paste perforated rim (descriptive category),
(Figure 45, C)
Sorting criteria. These sherds have a sandy paste
typical of Goose Creek Plain, unspecified variety, and

have a double row of perforations. The first row is
parallel to the rim and begins about 5 mm below the lip;
these perforations are quite small (1 mm diameter) and
penetrate entirely through the wall. Nearly 10 mm below the rim is the second row of perforations, much
larger (about 2.5 mm in diameter), and these also penetrate entirely through the vessel wall. There is no evidence that these perforations were capped by nodes or
bosses on either the interior or exterior of the vessel.
While the double row of through-the-wall perforations
is unlike Tchefuncte Perforated, variety Sabine, it is
possible there is a relationship to the Goose Creek Plain,
unspecified variety, that sports a double row of nodes
(Figure 45, A–A’). Since the sherds in this descriptive
category represent only a single vessel, may be unique,
and the rim treatment cannot be conceptually related to
any other Sabine Lake Area early ceramics, except
loosely to the perforated rims as a modal treatment,
they are handled here as a descriptive category rather
than a type or variety.
Local distribution. These sherds were found in
early Big Hill Period deposits at Pipkin Ranch. Whether
these have any relationship to the previously described
Tchefuncte Perforated is not known; the seriation data
would seem to indicate that the sandy paste perforated
vessel and the Goose Creek Plain with a double row of
nodes were both somewhat more recent than
Tchefuncte ceramics.
Sand-Tempered Wares
O’Neal Plain, variety Conway
Sorting criteria. O’Neal Plain, variety Conway,
is common in Sabine Lake Area collections and is easily identified by the inclusion of medium- to very-coarsegrained sand as temper added to a silty clay matrix
(Aten and Bollich 2002:42–48). Sherds often share with
Tchefuncte ceramics the crude coil wedging and rim
shaping which often makes orienting rims difficult or
impossible. Vessel lips sometimes have crudely executed
diagonal or perpendicular notching or scalloping. Also
there often are tool marks on the exterior like Tchefuncte
vessels.
O’Neal Plain, variety Conway, is usually fired
much harder than Tchefuncte wares, perhaps a necessity to hold the large sand grains in place. One sherd of
noded O’Neal Plain has been recovered from the early
Orange Period Eddleman site (Figure 46, A–A’). The

Appendix A: Sabine Lake Area Early Ceramics

treatment consists of a single row of nodes on the exterior wall parallel to the vessel lip and about 5.5 mm
below it; a second row of nodes is just below the first
and all are spaced at about 7.2 mm intervals. Unlike
most instances of nodes in which the tool used is a
cylindrical object such as a plant stem or branch, nodes
on this vessel were made by pushing through from the
interior a flat tool of some sort.
A large number of O’Neal Plain oriented rims were
recovered which were more or less equally divided between unrestricted and restricted vessels in both the
Orange Period and Big Hill Period sites (Table 43). A
range of vessel orifice sizes was found but the preponderance of examples were in the middle range or from
16 to 25 cm diameter (Table 44). Base forms from the
Orange Period collections were mostly flat, but only a
single example of a round base was recovered from Big
Hill Period sites (Table 45). Vessel rims were often made
thinner than the wall below, and sometimes there is a
short clay flap on the interior of the lip.
Local distribution. The distinctiveness of O’Neal
Plain, variety Conway, in Sabine and southeast Texas
ceramics was first recognized by C. N. Bollich. This
coarsely sand-tempered variety is abundant at sites in
the Sabine Lake Area and in much reduced quantities
in Galveston Bay Area sites. Its distribution north and
east of the Sabine is undocumented at this time. In the
Sabine, variety Conway is a major class throughout the
Orange and Big Hill periods but continues in lesser proportions into the Late Prehistoric. By virtue of the sandtemper, early ceramic chronological and cultural associations, and occasional distinctive rim node treatment,
this type—and related types described below—are believed to be related in some manner to the O’Neal Plain
and Alexander Incised types of south Louisiana (cf.,
Ford and Quimby 1945; Phillips 1970).
Conway Incised, variety Cove (Figure 46, B–D)
Sorting criteria. Incised designs are reported for
the first time on typical O’Neal Plain, variety Conway,
sand-tempered paste. Three separate design motifs are
represented: a set of at least four, apparently horizontal, parallel straight lines; a set of diagonal parallel lines;
and a complex, although crudely executed, design consisting of two roughly parallel saw-tooth lines (possibly
an incised imitation of plain rocker stamping) accompanied by a row of vertical “tics” arranged diagonally
from near the rim to interfere with the saw-tooth line

159

(Figure 46, C). They resemble certain motifs found on
Clear Lake to Turtle Bay Period Goose Creek Incised
(Aten 1983:Figure 12.2) and are unlike those previously reported for Alexander Incised in either northern
Alabama or the Ponchartrain basin (Phillips 1970:37).
Local distribution. Thus far this type/variety has
been found only from two Orange Period sites in the
Sabine Lake Area. The type name applied here is derived from the sand-tempered plainware and is intended
to indicate their close association. The variety name
applied here is after a small community south of Orange, Texas, near where most of the sherds were found;
see USGS Orange Quadrangle, Louisiana-Texas.
Conway Red-Filmed, variety Conway
Sorting criteria. The paste of these sherds is
coarse-grained and sand-tempered, identical to O’Neal
Plain, variety Conway, with a coating of red mineral
pigment probably as a wash or a slip on the exterior
surface. Such treatment is also found on early
Tchefuncte Plain and Goose Creek Plain, but not on
local grog-tempered ware.
Local distribution. These sherds were recovered
from the late Orange Period Black Hill Mound. Again
the type name is derived from the sand-tempered
plainware and is intended to indicate their close association. Using Conway also for the variety name indicates an expectation that little if any variation in the
distinctive surface treatment will be found as is the case
with other red-filmed types in southeast Texas.
Orleans Punctated, variety Conway (Figure 46, E)
Sorting criteria. This is another of several decorated forms in the O’Neal Plain series in the Sabine
Lake Area. The paste is coarse-grained sand-tempered;
vessel wall thickness ranges from 4.6 to 5.8 mm. The
portion of design motif present is simple incised lines
with linear arrangements of punctations filling alternate
zones; the punctations were executed using a round,
pointed tool impressed at an acute angle. It is an unmistakably Orleans Punctated design but it is executed on
a substantially different, non-Tchefuncte, paste. One
of what appear to be five distinctive varieties of Orleans Punctated reported here from the Sabine Lake
Area, it also is part of a growing assemblage of sandtempered types found in the Sabine.
Local distribution. A single sherd of this variety

160

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

was recorded at the early Orange Period Eddleman site.
The variety name, Conway, is used to help recall association with the local O’Neal series of sand-tempered
ceramics.
Sandy Paste, Grog-Tempered Wares
Baytown Plain, variety San Jacinto
Sorting criteria. Sherds of this variety are expected to have a substantial proportion of very-finegrained or larger sand. Variety San Jacinto sherds in
the Sabine Lake Area often have a finer-grained paste
than is typical westward in the Galveston Bay Area;
occasionally this creates problems in separating variety
San Jacinto from variety Phoenix Lake, but this is
expected in separating varieties rather than types. Overall
the variety San Jacinto sherds do not look or feel like
typical variety Phoenix Lake sherds. The latter usually
have abundant grogs and finer matrix whereas variety
San Jacinto typically has relatively sparse grogs and
superficially resembles Goose Creek Plain, unspecified
variety; see Aten and Bollich (2002:42–50) for detailed
paste descriptions. Although only a single oriented rim
of an unrestricted vessel was found in Orange Period
collections, 22 oriented rims—three/fourths of them also
from unrestricted vessels—were found associated with
Big Hill Period collections (Table 43). The majority of
orifice diameters measured were from small-mouthed
vessels (Table 44) and the base forms documented were
diverse but the majority were flat bases (Table 45).
Local distribution. In the Sabine, Baytown Plain,
variety San Jacinto, is a minor variety in the Orange
Period but then gradually expands to be 30 to 40 percent of the Big Hill Period ceramic assemblages. This
is substantially different than in the Galveston Bay Area
where grog-tempered wares do not appear until after
the local early ceramic periods are far into the past.
San Jacinto Incised, variety Jamison (Figure 47,
A–G)
Sorting criteria. This variety has the same casually grog-tempered, sandy paste characteristics as
Baytown Plain, variety San Jacinto. In addition it has
straight-line geometric design motifs incised into the
vessel wall just below the rim (cf. Aten 1983:241–243).
Generally the designs are just one or more sets of horizontal lines around the rim, but some simple pendant

triangles or use of punctations also occur similar to the
incised designs on Baytown Plain, variety Spindletop,
and Goose Creek Incised, variety Goose Creek. Only
two oriented rims were found in the Orange Period
collections, one each from an unrestricted and a restricted vessel. The same was found in the Big Hill
Period collections.
Local distribution. In the collections available for
this study, San Jacinto Incised, variety Jamison, appears late in the Orange Period and is commonly found
afterward, although in small numbers. This variety is
also found in the Galveston Bay Area, although not
until the much later Round Lake Period and the design
motifs then tend to be more complex (cf. Aten 1983:Figure 12.2).
Marksville Stamped, variety Block Bayou (Figure
46, F–J)
Sorting criteria. These sherds are from vessels
with unmistakable Marksville incised designs with alternate zones roughened with a dentate stamping. The
paste ranges from silty clay with moderate amounts of
medium to coarse sand and small amounts of grogtempering; wall thicknesses are on the order of 4 to 5
mm. The paste is local to the Sabine Lake Area and
vicinity and is much like, although a bit coarser than,
Baytown Plain, variety San Jacinto. The sherds illustrated in Figure 46, H–I are the best preserved illustrations of the stamping technique, and appear to be rocker
stamping with a dentate tool. Only a single oriented rim
of this variety was found at the Conway D site. It is
from a restricted vessel form (Table 43) with quite a
small orifice diameter.
Local distribution. This new variety has been
found at both Orange Period and Big Hill Period sites
as well as an undated collection (Figure 46, H). No
sherds with Marksville design motifs have yet been reported west of the Sabine Lake Area and the distribution to the east is undefined although in south-central
Louisiana and eastward, Marksville Stamped designs
take a number of different forms. This new local variety is named for a tributary of the Neches River about
11.5 km upstream from the river mouth; see the USGS
Terry Quadrangle, Texas.
Marksville Stamped (?), unidentified variety
Sorting criteria. The paste of this sherd is com-

Appendix A: Sabine Lake Area Early Ceramics

parable to Baytown Plain, variety San Jacinto. It has
worn indentations that may be remnants of a Marksville
stamped design but they are too small to be certain.
Local distribution. The Pipkin Ranch collection
containing this sherd is attributable to the early Big Hill
Period.
Brushed-incised (descriptive category) (Figure 46,
K)
Sorting criteria. The paste of this vessel is generally similar to the sandy paste, grog-tempered Baytown
Plain, variety San Jacinto, but the vessel form and
brushed-incised motif are executed in ways that do not
suggest similarity or relationship to any other types or
varieties in the southeast Texas-southwest Louisiana
region. The design motif is chevrons pendant from about
10 mm below the lip to more than 50 mm down the
vessel wall. The design is straight-line brush incising
possibly executed with the shredded end of a twig. The
lip is equally unusual in that it has incised lines perpendicular to the rim with the intervening spaces scalloped.
The vessel form was a restricted jar with the wall tapering slightly inward toward a direct rim. The notched,
or scalloped, and incised lip is similar to Marksville rim
treatment (Toth 1974:126). Wall thickness was around
5 mm and wall smoothing was rather crude.
Local distribution. These sherds are from the
top level of the Eddleman site and are either early Orange Period or possibly from a brief later occupation.
Because of their unusual nature and the inability to associate them with any other ceramics they are reported
here as a descriptive category.
Clay Paste, Grog-Tempered Wares

161

the Big Hill Period three/fourths of the rims were from
restricted vessels (Table 43); nearly two/thirds were
from small-mouthed vessels (Table 44), and most base
forms were flat (Table 45).
Local distribution. Baytown Plain varieties are
found in small quantities in the Sabine from early Orange Period and they begin a significant expansion in
the Big Hill Period. In these two early ceramic chronological periods variety Phoenix Lake is notably less
abundant than variety San Jacinto (cf. Figure 4). Both
varieties are late in appearing in the Galveston Bay Area
and variety Phoenix Lake is particularly rare there except briefly around the end of the Round Lake Period
to early Old River Period (Aten 1983:288). The distribution of variety Phoenix Lake to the east into southwest Louisiana is unknown because of the absence of
collections analyzed there.
San Jacinto Incised, variety Spindletop (Figure 41,
H–N)
Sorting criteria. This variety has the same paste
characteristics as Baytown Plain, variety Phoenix Lake.
In the early ceramic periods incised designs are largely
straight lines parallel to vessel rims although occasionally more complicated designs are found (Figure 47,
H–N; also see Aten 1983:Figure 12.2). Of the rare rims
found that could be oriented, there was a tendency for
restricted vessels, and small to medium orifice diameters (Tables 43, 44); no base forms were found.
Local distribution. This incised variety appears
in the early Orange Period and continues in small quantities through the Big Hill Period.
Marksville Incised or Stamped, unidentified
variety (Figure 47, P)

Baytown Plain, variety Phoenix Lake
Sorting criteria. This variety is characterized by
relatively abundant grog particles—much more than is
found in variety San Jacinto—in a clay or silty clay
matrix that is finer than the sandy clay matrix also typical of variety San Jacinto. A recent more quantitative
paste description can be found in Aten and Bollich
(2002:42–45); also see Aten (1983:241). A few oriented
variety Phoenix Lake rims were found. In the Orange
Period, one each was from restricted and unrestricted
vessels (Table 43), and both were from vessels with
small orifices (Table 44) and flat bases (Table 45). In

Sorting criteria. This sherd is from a vessel with
a paste like Baytown Plain, variety Phoenix Lake; i.e.,
abundant grogs in a silty clay matrix. It is very badly
eroded but when a raking light is played on the exterior
surface, shadows appear of what apparently once were
wide U-shaped incised lines (Figure 47, P). Because of
the extreme erosion of the sherd surface it is not possible to determine if the Marksville style of incising was
accompanied by stamping. The combination of linear
and curvilinear lines is suggestive of Marksville Incised,
variety Marksville (cf. Toth 1974:102–109) but on a
local paste containing coarser silt than might be found

162

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

on this type in south Louisiana.
Local distribution. This apparently Marksville
associated sherd is from the early Orange Period (Table
42).
Fingernail punctated (descriptive category),
(Figure 47, O)
Sorting criteria. This is a silty clay matrix with
grog-tempering. The surface apparently was covered
with widely-spaced fingernail indentations. The sherd
does not bring to mind any existing type or variety in
the Sabine or vicinity, and for the present it is treated
here as a descriptive category.
Local distribution. This sherd was found in a
late Orange Period collection (Table 42).
Mixed and Other Tempering
Sherd groupings described below occur so rarely
that it is difficult to say at this time whether they are
intentional paste mixtures or are just incidental and/or
accidental mixtures. Although many of these examples
came from the late Big Hill Period level at the Gaulding
site, these odd combinations are not unusual in southeast Texas and the Sabine even though their numbers
are always very small. Usually they are just not given a
great deal of attention. At this time the bone-tempered
category probably is the best candidate for treatment as
a variety, although this was not done in the present
study.
Bone-tempered plain (descriptive category)
Sorting criteria. These sherds have a sandy paste,
similar to Goose Creek Plain, unspecified variety, with
5 to 25 percent bone fragments. Often the paste will
include abundant small iron nodules. No information is
available on vessel forms.
Local distribution. Both plain and incised bonetempered pottery are fairly common in protohistoric
and historic time, and the plainware occurs rarely, but
consistently, in early ceramic contexts in both the Sabine
Lake and in the Galveston Bay areas (Aten 1983:244,
283; Aten and Bollich 2002:52). This consistency suggests that occasional use of bone-tempering did occur
in early ceramic times and was not a case of random
inclusions when making Goose Creek pottery or of displaced sherds from late contexts. Nevertheless, its oc-

currence is so sporadic that an early pattern of distribution is not yet evident (Table 42).
Grog and bone-tempered plain (descriptive
category)
Sorting criteria. These sherds have a paste reminiscent of Baytown Plain, variety Phoenix Lake, or
grog-tempering in a silty or clayey paste. In addition
they include bone fragments as tempering.
Local distribution. This mixed tempering category
was recorded from both Orange Period and Big Hill
Period sites in the Sabine Lake Area. It is not reported
elsewhere in the southeast Texas-southwest Louisiana
area (Table 42).
Grog and shell-tempered plain (descriptive
category)
Sorting criteria. The paste matrix contains 10 to
20 percent very fine sand and similar proportions of
grogs and particles of Rangia cuneata shells; see Aten
and Bollich (2002:52) for more details.
Local distribution. These sherds, apparently from
a single vessel, were all reported at the late Big Hill
Period Gaulding site (Table 42).
Sand and bone-tempered plain (descriptive
category)
Sorting criteria. This sherd contains sand predominantly in the fine- and medium-grained categories
along with a small proportion of bone fragments (Aten
and Bollich 2002:52). Very-fine-grained sand is absent
indicating a discontinuity between the clay and sand in
the matrix suggesting the coarser sand was added to the
clay as a tempering agent.
Local distribution. This sherd was reported at
the late Big Hill Period Gaulding site (Table 42).
Sand and grog-tempered plain (descriptive category)
Sorting criteria. This category has medium- and
fine-grained sand but no very fine sand, along with grog
fragments. The discontinuity in sand/silt grain sizes suggest the sand was added to the clay matrix as a tempering agent.
Local distribution. This sherd was also re-

Appendix A: Sabine Lake Area Early Ceramics

ported at the late Big Hill Period Gaulding site (Table
42).
Grog and bone-tempered brushed - Caddo?
(descriptive category)
Sorting criteria. The matrix of these sherds, apparently from a single vessel, is a silty clay with considerable grog and bone fragments as temper. Rim and
base sherds indicate this was a restricted vessel with a

163

small orifice and flat base (see Aten and Bollich
2002:52). Most of the vessel exterior, from rim to base,
was covered with brushed incised and punctated design elements.
Local distribution. Consultation with other specialists suggests this vessel is possibly of Neches River
Caddo origin (see Aten and Bollich 2002:52 for extended discussion). Although found with the late Big
Hill Period level at the Gaulding site (Table 42), this
vessel probably postdates that association.

PROJECTILE POINTS FROM SABINE LAKE AREA
EARLY CERAMIC SITES

INTRODUCTION
After ceramics the next largest class of tools found
in these early ceramic collections is chipped stone projectile points. There are nearly 80 such specimens largely
from the Eddleman and Black Hill Mound sites (Figures 49 to 52; Table 46). These tools, while more or
less typical of types found in southeastern Texas, are
not as common at coastal sites compared to those occupied in the interior of the coastal plain where lithic
raw material sources are more readily available. This
holds even when accounting for tools reworked from
formerly inland Paleoindian and Archaic sites, such as
at McFaddin Beach, that have been artificially relocated into the present coastal zone by rising sea level
(Stright et al. 1999).
Among projectile points in the Sabine there is considerable local variation in adherence to any formal style
or function design concepts apparently caused by the
scarcity, small size, and commonly poor chipping quality of resource pebbles and cobbles that are available.
This material often must have been difficult to work,
frequently was resharpened, and broken points were
reworked. Often it is the case that the tool blade, rather
than be a relatively well-formed triangle, is asymmetrical with one blade edge being straight and the other
with a pronounced convexity which may indicate that
these tools were manufactured either to do double duty
as projectile points and knives, or exclusively to be one
or the other. No examples of unifacially chipped arrow
points were seen in these collections (cf. Patterson
1994).
In any event, by pooling the entire collection of
these tools from all the early ceramic collections employed in this study it is possible to obtain a sense of
the overall projectile point typological picture in the
Sabine Lake area at this time (Table 47). For instance,

Kent and Gary dart points are the most abundant types
found in the waning centuries of dart technology as it
played out in the Sabine Lake region. They comprise
somewhat more than half of all dart points so far recovered from sites of that age. But even though individual specimens can be recognized as “Kent” or “Gary”
types there are other formal characters that can be used
to further identify groupings (Table 48). Ordinarily, these
forms might be classified as varieties as was done with
the ceramics. However, understanding of Sabine Lake
ceramics is based on relationships among thousands of
sherds while our emerging understanding of early ceramic period projectile points is based on an aggregate
of less than 100 or so specimens; as a result the recognition of potential tool variability is left with informal
names despite seeing in the area for the first time a
distinctive set of projectile point forms.
Unless noted otherwise, the characteristics of types
here are consistent with their generally recognized criteria (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1999).
It is when looking at all these specimens together,
though, that particular Sabine Lake Area forms become
more obvious. Describing these is one purpose of Appendix B along with obviating the needless repetition of
describing the projectile point types as they occur at
each site. The descriptions and procedures for documentation of lithics used here are similar to those employed at the Gaulding site (Aten and Bollich 2002).
Brief notation of the individual specimens is given in
each chapter discussing the site from which they came
and a consolidated table of key attributes (Table 48) is
included in this Appendix for use along with the narrative descriptions.

Alba
Sorting criteria. Alba points in the Sabine are
fairly conventional in form with the important exception that barbs and stems are not a significant feature
(Figure 49, A–C). They have prominent, bifacially
worked, triangular blades (comprising about 90 percent

of the total artifact length) that are slightly elongate with
the blade width equal to three-fourths of the blade
height. Blade edges are either straight or slightly concave; shoulders are wide and straight without prominent barbs. The hafting stems of the local version of
this point are parallel sided, quite short, and are about
twice as wide as they are long. One of the specimens is

Local distribution. Alba points are relatively common in the post-early ceramic collections. In the early
ceramic collections, one was found at the top of late
Big Hill Period deposits at the Gaulding site. Another
rather crude specimen that we have called Alba was
found at the top of the early Orange Period Eddleman
site, but these two specimens could have been dropped
at any later time and are not in certain contexts for an
arrow point.
Perdiz
Sorting criteria. The local Perdiz points also are
conventional forms but again with the exception that
they often lack pronounced barbs (Figure 49, D–G).
They have small, bifacially-worked blades that are nearly
equilateral triangles. The blades have nearly straight
edges and straight to slightly downward shoulders sometimes with small barbs. Stems comprise about 30 percent of the overall artifact length, are generally longer

than they are wide, and have sides contracting to a
point. All of these specimens were made of chert and
one may be heat treated.
Local distribution. Perdiz points also are common in post-early ceramic collections. In the earlier collections, one was found at the top of late Big Hill Period deposits at the Gaulding site. Another was excavated from the late Orange Period Black Hill Mound
and yet another in the early Big Hill Period 41JF31A
site but in deposits that had animal burrows and other
disturbances. Again, these points could have been
dropped on these sites at any later time or inserted by
rodent activity and not be associated with the principal
early ceramic collections found there.
Arrow Form 1
Sorting criteria. These specimens are not associated with any currently described type. Both have
small, bifacial, triangular blades and relatively wide parallel-sided stems (Figure 49, H–I). It is possible the
small blades are the result of periodic resharpening.

Blades are about as wide as they are long; stems comprise about a quarter of the total point length and tend
to be substantially wider than they are long. This form,
in terms of maximum length and width, is smaller than
all the other arrow point forms. Both specimens were
made of chert, tend toward reddish color although heattreatment was not indicated, and one specimen showed
use wear on the blade edges.
Local distribution. Both Form 1 specimens were
found in late Orange and early Big Hill period contexts
that are not secure. At Black Hill Mound (41JF24) disturbance has been significant, and at Pipkin Ranch
Mound A, animal burrows were associated with the
point and may have introduced the point into the subsurface.
Arrow Form 2
Sorting criteria. These specimens also are not
associated with any currently described type. Both have
bifacially-worked, elongated blades with crudely serrated edges; the edges of one are concave, have prominent upturned barbs, and one displays use wear around
the blade edge. Both also have distinctively short but
wide stems with sides contracting to a point (Table 48).
One has no shoulders, the other very modest shoulders; both are made of chert and one appears heat
treated.

Local distribution. Both specimens are from
pimple mound sites at Pipkin Ranch and potentially
were subject to some subsurface relocation due to animal burrowing. One point was from a post-early ceramic context, and the other uncertainly associated with
an early Big Hill Period context (Table 47).
Dart Points, expanding stems
Darl (?)
Sorting criteria. The blade of this point is broken and so its original length is not known. However, it
had an elongated triangular blade, weak shoulders and
a straight-sided stem, wider than long, and with a more
or less or slightly concave base (Figure 49, M). This
point was made of white silicified wood. No other data
are available at this time.
Local distribution. This point is from the late
Orange Period Black Hill Mound site.
Palmillas
Sorting criteria. Two of these specimens have
short triangular blades with straight to slightly convex
edges; a third has an elongate leaf-shaped blade (Figure
49, O–Q). All have short round stems and minimal
shoulders. Stems are wider than long and comprise be-

tween a quarter and a third of the total length of the
artifact. Two specimens are made of chert and a third
of quartzite. There are some indications of use wear on
the high ridges between flake scars.
Local distribution. All three specimens were
found in Orange Period assemblages.
Yarbrough
Sorting criteria. This moderate-sized point has
an elongated triangular blade with pronounced shoulders but no barbs (Figure 50, A). The stem is wider
than its length and expands to meet a flat or slightly
curved base in a distinct angle. The artifact is made of
silicified wood. No other information is available at this
time.
Local distribution. This specimen is from the late
Orange Period Black Hill Mound.

Yarbrough-like
Sorting criteria. Inspection readily indicates these
projectile points are peculiarly shaped (Figure 50, B–
D). While they bring to mind the Yarbrough type, it has
been suggested to us (D. A. Story, personal communication) that these points were made by early ceramic
people reworking points like Calf Creek or similar large
stemmed Early Archaic projectile points into an approximation of the Yarbrough form. This is quite possible
given the presence of such early components at several
locations in the Sabine, e.g., Black Hill Mound (41JF24)
and McFaddin Beach (Stright et al. 1999). Projectile
points with such an origin as these can be expected to
conform only loosely to a stylistic concept. In any event
these are relatively large points with elongated, triangular blades and stems that comprise about a third of the
total length and are about as wide as they are long.

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

Appendix B: Projectile Points from Sabine Lake Area Early Ceramic Sites

Most specimens are made of chert with one made of
quartzite. No other information is available at this time.
Local distribution. These points are all from the
Orange Period Black Hill Mound (see Chapter 5), a
site that has a recently discovered Early or Middle Archaic component that might be the source of the original points that were reworked during early ceramic times.
Williams
Sorting criteria. These bifaces range from small
to large in size; usually have elongated triangular blades,
often with convex edges; straight shoulders and occasionally slight barbs (Figure 49, R–W). The stems are
wider than long, and have expanding sides generally
formed by corner notching; the stem sides and base
meet in a characteristically round or bulbous shape rather
than the clean angle typical of, say, Yarbrough. Several
of these specimens have one straight blade edge and
one convex edge and may be knives or combination
projectile point/knives (PPKs). These are large, heavy
artifacts generally made of chert although one specimen of silicified wood was recovered. Luster suggests
some were occasionally made on heat-treated chert and
were beveled. It was common to find use wear on ridges
between flake scars and on blade edges.
Local distribution. All of these points are from
the early Orange Period Eddleman site.
Dart points, straight stems
Woden
Sorting criteria. These points usually have slightly
elongated blades of moderate length with straight to
convex edges (Figure 51, J–N). Stems are more or less
straight sided, comprise about a quarter of the total
length, and are usually much wider than they are long.
Most notable is that the base is usually unworked and
is the unmodified striking platform or cortical surface
of the resource cobble. These points are as likely to be
made of silicified wood as chert; silicified wood is not
easy to chip and the finished piece tends toward crude
or irregular work. One specimen has use wear on the
ridges between flake scars and on the blade edge. No
further information is available on the other specimens.
Local distribution. These points were found in
several collections that were attributed to the Orange
Period.

179

Kent
Sorting criteria. The general characteristics of
the Kent type are uneven and irregular chipping; roughly
triangular blades; weak, asymmetrical shoulders; and
more or less parallel-sided stems (Suhm and Jelks
1962:199; Turner and Hester 1999:136). In the Sabine
collections there were many dart points meeting these
characteristics, but it was possible to sort them further
as is described below. Generally, Form 1 is the longer,
narrower form; Form 2 is similarly long but wider; and
Form 3 is narrower and shorter than the other two forms
(cf. Table 48). These three forms might be the basis
for varieties and be used to document such things as
the transition from dart to bow and arrow technology.
However, at this time it seems more likely they reflect
progressively advanced degrees of resharpening with
Form 2 the least resharpened, then Form 1, and finally
Form 3 as the most extensively resharpened.
Sabine Lake Area Form 1 (Figure 50, E–P): In
addition to the general attributes described above, Form
1 Kent points have especially narrow, elongated blades,
and exceptionally weak, asymmetrical shoulders. Stems
comprise about a quarter of total length and are a little
wider than they are long. Most of these points were
made of chert, although silicified wood or quartzite was
used occasionally. Sometimes the chert was heat-treated,
the blade was beveled, and use wear was evident on
the blade face or edge (see Table 48).
Sabine Lake Area Form 2 (Figure 51, A–I): In
addition to the general attributes, Form 2 Kent points
have wider blades than Form 1 and much more prominent but asymmetrical shoulders. Stems comprise about
a fifth of the total length and are noticeably wider than
Form 1 specimens. This form too is nearly always made
of chert although silicified wood was seen also. Rarely
a Form 2 point was heat-treated.
Sabine Lake Area Form 3 (Figure 50, Q–V): Again,
in addition to the general characteristics, Form 3 Kent
points have short, wide blades approaching an equilateral form and moderately prominent but asymmetrical
shoulders. Stems comprise between a quarter and a
third of the total length and are yet wider in relation to
stem length than the previous two forms. These may
be Form 2 points that have been much reworked.
Local distribution. In the Sabine Lake area these
three Kent forms were found often throughout the Orange Period and occasionally in Big Hill Period collections.

Early Ceramic Sites of the Sabine Lake Area, Coastal Texas and Louisiana

Dart points, contracting stems
Gary
Sorting criteria. The general characteristics of
the Gary type are triangular blades of moderate width
and edges ranging from slightly concave, to straight, to
slightly convex; absent to very well-developed shoulders; and very well-developed contracting stems usually with a convex base but occasionally with a somewhat flattened base (Suhm and Jelks 1962:197; Turner
and Hester 1999:123). Gary points were relatively abundant in the Sabine collections and it was possibly to
distinguish several forms that constituted minor variations on the basic Gary type. As noted above, once
better documented these forms may serve as the basis
for varieties in the future.
Sabine Lake Area Form 1 (Figure 51, O): In addition to the general characteristics, the single example of
a Form 1 Gary point has an elongated blade, no shoulders, and a base that is flat. The stem comprises a third
of the total length. This point is made of chert that was
heat-treated, is beveled on the right side of the blade,
and shows use wear on both the blade and stem edges.
Sabine Lake Area Form 2 (Figure 51, P–S): Form
2 Gary points have relatively wide blades with welldeveloped shoulders and well-developed inverted bellshaped contracting stems. The stems comprise a quarter of the total tool length and tend to be wider than
they are long. Most specimens are made of chert although one is silicified wood. One specimen is beveled
on the left side of the blade and two show use wear on
the blade, blade edge, and stem edge.
Sabine Lake Area Form 3 (Figure 52, A–D): Form
3 Gary points are smaller than the other forms with
relatively broad and short blades that have slightly concave to slightly convex edges, and large inverted bellshaped stems comprising nearly a third of the total length.
The stems generally are wider than long. While most of
these tools are made of chert, silicified wood and quartzite also were used. There was no record of heat-treatment or beveling, and little of use wear. This form may
be the end result of resharpening other Gary forms,
particularly the Form 2.
Sabine Lake Area Form 4 (Figure 52, E–K): Form
4 Gary points are of a size intermediate between Form
2 and Form 3. The blade is elongate and relatively nar-

row, the edges vary from slightly concave to slightly
convex and the contracting stems are proportionally
about a quarter of the total tool length. Most of the
points were made of chert although one made of silicified wood was found. Two specimens appear to have
been made of heat-treated chert and several showed
considerable use wear on the blade face and edges.
Local distribution. In the Sabine Lake area the
Gary points were found in several collections throughout the Orange Period and in diminished amounts in
the Big Hill Period.
Dart points, other forms
San Patrice
Sorting criteria. This specimen (Figure 49, L) is
an excellent example of the late Paleoindian St. Johns
variety of the San Patrice type (cf. Turner and Hester
1999:181–182). It has a triangular blade, prominent
basal ears and fluting on both sides. This example was
made of chert but no other information is available at
this time.
Local distribution. This San Patrice point was
found at Black Hill Mound (41JF24) around 1965 but
it is not known whether it was in association with the
early ceramic Orange Period component or with the
recently identified Early Archaic deposits. San Patrice,
as well as other early projectile points, turn up from
time to time in later contexts and often are presumed to
have been collected by later Indians. Sometimes, in
this stone poor region, these old projectile points were
used as a flake or core and fashioned into something
more contemporary as appears to be the case with the
Yarbrough-like points. Or perhaps the unique shape of
the San Patrice tool caused it to be kept as part of a
medicine bundle or for some other significance.
Lanceolate
Sorting criteria. This is a rare form in the Sabine.
It is bifacially worked and fairly symmetrical but is very
narrow and long (Figure 49, N). There is no distinguishable stem. The specimen is made of chert. No
other information is available at this time.
Local distribution. This specimen is from a collection attributed to the late Orange Period.
