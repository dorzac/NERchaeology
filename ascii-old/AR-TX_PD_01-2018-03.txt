Abstract
On May 14, 2014, Pape-Dawson archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of Devon
Energy’s proposed oil well pads and frac pond situated on lands owned by the University of Texas Land
Systems approximately 5.2 miles southwest of the former community of Texon, and 23.6 miles west of
Big Lake in Reagan County, Texas. The crew excavated five judgmentally placed shovel tests within this
approximately 6.3 hectare (15.5-acre) project area (split into two locations), all of which were negative
for cultural materials. This work, performed in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas, was
performed under Texas Antiquities Permit #6875. No federal permitting or funding is attached to this
project, so compliance with Section 106 of the National Register of Historic Places is not necessary.
Archaeologists recorded one archaeological site, 41RG383, within the footprint of the well pads. This
site did not contain diagnostic artifacts or a buried component; it consisted of two hearths and two
artifacts (a flake and a preform), all of which were observed on the surface. No historic structures were
observed within the project footprint or within the vicinity of the project area. Due to the lack of
diagnostic artifacts, the ephemeral nature of the site, and the lack of buried deposits, the principal
investigator recommends that this site is not eligible to be a State Antiquities Landmark, and that no
further archaeological work at this site is necessary.

Management Summary
Devon Energy proposes to construct two oil wells on a shared well pad and a frac pond on lands owned
by the University of Texas Land Systems in Reagan County, Texas. The project area is approximately 5.2
miles (8.4 kilometers (km)) southwest of the former community of Texon (Figure 1). The project will
encompass approximately 6.2 hectares (15.5 acres) of land (split into two locations). The well pad will
require very shallow (less than 1 foot (ft) or 3 meters (m)) vertical disturbance. The frac pond will be
approximately 12-16 ft (3.6-4.8 m) deep.
Since the project is located on lands owned by the University of Texas, compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT) is necessary. Pape-Dawson obtained Antiquities Permit #6875 prior to initiating
fieldwork. No federal permitting or funding is attached to this project, so compliance with Section 106 of
the National Register of Historic Places is not necessary.
A Secretary of the Interior qualified archaeologist led an intensive pedestrian survey on May 14, 2014.
Fieldwork resulted in one archaeological site (41RG383) being recorded within the boundaries of one of
the well pads. No diagnostic artifacts were observed or recovered during the course of this work. Due to
the lack of diagnostics and relative paucity of artifacts and features at the site, the principal investigator
recommends the site is not eligible as a State Antiquities Landmark.

Introduction
Devon Energy (Devon) proposes to construct two oil wells on a shared pad and a frac pond on lands
owned by the University of Texas Land Systems. The project will encompass approximately 15.5 acres
(6.2 hectares) of land (split into two locations), and is situated in Reagan County, Texas, about 5.2 miles
(8.4 kilometers (km)) southwest of the former community of Texon (Figure 1). The well pad will require
very shallow (less than 1 foot (ft) or 3 meters (m)) vertical disturbance. The frac pond will be
approximately 12-16 ft (3.6-4.8 m) deep.
Since the project is located on lands owned by the University of Texas, compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT) is necessary. Pape-Dawson obtained Antiquities Permit #6875 prior to initiating
fieldwork. No federal permitting or funding is attached to this project, so compliance with Section 106 of
the National Register of Historic Places is not necessary.
A Secretary of the Interior qualified archaeologist led fieldwork on May 14, 2014. Fieldwork resulted in
one archaeological site (41RG383) being recorded within the boundaries of one of the well pads. No
diagnostic artifacts were observed or recovered during the course of this work. Due to the lack of
diagnostics and relative paucity of artifacts and features at the site, the principal investigator
recommends the site is not eligible as a State Antiquities Landmark.

Project Setting
Soils

Soils in the project area are predominantly mapped as Reagan loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes. The proposed
frac pond location is situated entirely on these soils, while the well pad is proposed to be constructed on
Reagan loam 0 to 1 percent slopes (RaA), Reagan loam 1 to 3 percent slopes (RaB), and Ector very
gravelly loam, 8 to 30 percent slopes, very stony (ECE) (Figure 2).
RaA and RaB soils are very deep, well drained upland soils on plains that originate with limestone
produced alluvium. Ector soils are also derived from limestone, consisting of residual loam. These very
shallow soils are found on slopes and are well drained (Soil Survey Staff 2014). Both Reagan and Ector
soils are Cretaceous age, suggesting the potential for deeply buried archaeological sites is low (Bureau of
Economic Geography 1992). Cultural materials in this area are likely to be found on or near the current
ground surface.
According to the soil survey, Reagan soils consist of an approximately 8 inch (20 cm) brown loam layer
over an approximately 22 inch (56 cm) thick subsoil. Below the subsoil, reddish yellow clay loam can be
found; it ranges in depth from about 30 inches (76 cm) to 80 inches (203 cm) (Wiedenfeld 2003: 15).
Ector soils, however, are usually only about 14 inches (36 cm) of grayish brown loam with gravels over
limestone bedrock (Wiedenfeld 2003: 16). These shallow soils are usually found on hillsides and can be
covered with stone (Wiedenfeld 2003:23)

Flora

The Project Area is located in the Semiarid Edwards Plateau Level IV Ecoregion. The physiography of the
region is described as “flat to gently rolling plateaus dissected by canyons” (Griffith et al. 2007) with
mainly ephemeral and intermittent streams. This region is described as the transition between live oak
savannas and the arid west Texas desert. Grasslands were once predominant in the region but shifted
to shrubland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to anthropogenic suppression of natural
grassland fires and intensive grazing practices. Native grassland vegetation, in undisturbed areas for this
ecoregion, include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides).
In grazed areas, typical grassland vegetation includes Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha),
buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides), tobosa (Pleuraphis mutica). Although there is not sufficient
precipitation to support closed canopy forests, species of grassland and desert shrubs have been found
to occur including: mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), lotebush (Ziziphus obtusifolia), and prickly pear
(Opuntia engelmannii) (Griffith et al. 2007). Within the Project Area there are three mapped soil types.
Based upon these soil types, the following vegetation has been known to occur:

Observed vegetation at the Project Area was found to be consistent with published species occurrence
and include mesquite, juniper (Juniperus spp.), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), creosote (Larrea tridentate),
agarita (Mahonia trifoliolata), ephedra (Ephedra spp.), and grama (Grama spp.).

Climate

Located on the Edwards Plateau, Reagan County has a dry, warm climate with hot summers and warm
winters. Temperatures average 45 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (7 degrees Celsius (C)) in the winter and
approximately 79 degrees F (26 C) in the summer. Rainfall measures a little over 19 inches (in) (48.3
centimeters (cm)) annually. Irrigation is necessary for the soils to be used as cropland (Wiedenfeld 2003:
10-11).

Fauna

Native species found to occur in Reagan County include Baird’s Sparrow (Ammondramus bairdii),
western burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea), black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus),
spot-tailed earless lizard (Holbrookia lacerata), and Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum) (Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department 2011). Livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats) as well as private hunting
leases are listed as major contributors to the County’s economy (Smith 2010a). Game species include
white-tail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (O. hemionus), dove (Columba spp.), javelina
(Peccary angulatus), quail, and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo).
Prior to the late 19th century, the region was predominantly grasslands with sufficient coverage to
provide habitat for the Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae). Since then, due to soil loss and
subsequent desertification, Montezuma quail have not been observed in this ecoregion (Griffith et al.
2007). Additionally, The United States Fish and Wildlife (“USFWS”) list the Black-capped Vireo (Vireo
atricapilla) as a federally-protected species known to occur in Reagan County although no record of
sightings in the Project Area were found in the Texas Natural Diversity Database (TXNDD) (Department
of the Interior, United States Fish and Wildlife Service 2013; Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2013).
The gray wolf (Canis lupus) and black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) were once known to range
throughout the region but have since been extirpated (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2011).

Cultural Chronology
Burgess and Turpin (2013: 12) note that much of the Reagan County area is situated in a “transitional
zone between three defined cultural areas: the Southern Plains on the north, and the Eastern TransPecos and the Lower Pecos to the west and east respectively.” Perhaps somewhat of a prehistoric
“borderlands”, little in-depth testing or data recovery has taken place in this area. As a result, this
cultural area has not yet been defined with definitive radiocarbon dates, and most of the work that has
been done in in Reagan County (e.g., Turpin et al. 1997, Turpin 1994, Turpin and Riemenschneider 2001)
has been focused around Big Lake, where there is evidence of human occupations throughout multiple
phases in prehistory. As such, this cultural chronology briefly highlights the major cultural periods with
reference to the work done in the vicinity.

6

Paleoindian (11,500 B.P. – 8,500 B.P.)

Although there is some debate about whether pre-Clovis Paleoindian peoples lived in Texas, there is
evidence of Paleoindian occupation within Texas by 11,500 B.P. Collins (1995:376, 381) has proposed
dividing this period into early and late phases, with Dalton, San Patrice, and Plainview possibly providing
the transition between them. Research has shown Paleoindians were gathering wild plants and hunting
large mammals (mammoth, bison, etc.) as well as smaller terrestrial and aquatic animals (Collins 1995:
381; Bousman et al. 2004: 75). In Texas, most Paleoindian sites are classified as procurement or
consumption sites (Bousman et al. 2004: 76-78), but a few, (Wilson-Leonard, Horn Shelter 2) have
produced burials in context (Collins 1995: 383). In Reagan County, one Paleoindian site, the Big Lake
Site (41RG13), has been located. This bison kill site has provided insight into Paleoindian foodways
(Turpin et al. 1993, 1997).
As the climate warmed, the Paleoindian people began to shift focus. The changing environment, which
led to extinction of the megafauna, likely influenced their decision to focus more on hunting small game
animals, including deer and rabbit, as well as gathering edible roots, nuts, and fruits (Black 1989). This
change in food supply, as well as a different set of stone tools, marks the transition into the Archaic
Period.

Archaic (8,500 B.P. – 1,200 B.P.)

Usually divided into early, middle, late, and sometimes transitional sub-periods, the Archaic marks a
gradual shift from hunting Megafauna and some smaller animals supplemented with wild plants to a
focus on hunting and gathering medium and small animals and wild plants, and an eventual transition to
agriculture. The toolkit changes over time, beginning with Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe bifaces in
the Early Archaic (8500 B.P. – 6000 B.P.) , transitioning to Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and NolanTravis points in the Middle Archaic (6000 B.P. – 4000 B.P.), to the Bulverde, Pedernales, Ensor, Frio, and
Marcos points in the Late Archaic (4000 B.P. – 1300 B.P.) (Turner and Hester 1993; Collins 1995).The
variety of points and their scattered distribution over a large area in the Early Archaic may indicate
smaller groups of people moving over larger territories (Prewitt 1981). The Middle Archaic focus on
constructing burned rock ovens to cook a diverse array of plant food (Black 1989) suggests a slightly
more sedentary focus. In the western part of the Central Texas area, burned rock ovens were used well
into the Late Archaic and even into the Late Prehistoric (Collins 1995). Archaic sites in Reagan County
include 41RG13, 41RG14, and 41RG38.

Late Prehistoric (1,200 B.P. – 250 B.P.)

As the Archaic transitioned into the Late Prehistoric period, several technological changes become
apparent. The most notable change is the use of the bow and arrow rather than the spear and atlatl,
evidenced by smaller dart points. Another significant innovation is the creation and use of ceramic
vessels. Some groups began to practice consistent agriculture during this time as well; there is some
evidence that peoples in Central Texas may have incorporated agriculture into their lives, but primarily
remained hunter gatherers (Collins 1995). Also during this period, there are possible indications of major
population movements, changes in settlement patterns and perhaps lower population densities (Black
1989). Archaeologists divide the Late Prehistoric into two phases: the Austin phase, followed by the
7

Toyah. In Reagan County, Turpin (1994) has recorded Late Prehistoric sites with Late Prehistoric
components near Big Lake, including a large Toyah component near the west end of the lake.

Historic (1700s – 1964)

Although it is possible that Spanish explorers may have passed through the area, encountering Jumano,
Kiowa, and Comanche peoples, as early as 1684 when Juan Dominguez de Mendoza’s expedition
reportedly camped at Grierson Springs, extensive settlement and exploration did not occur during the
eighteenth century. Certainly Native groups continued to occupy and traverse the landscape, but
European settlers likely camped only temporarily during the mid-1800s, when the Butterfield Overland
Mail route was established through Reagan County (Smith 2010a). This stage route was in operation
from 1858 through 1861 from St. Louis, Missouri and Memphis, Tennessee, across Texas to San
Francisco, California (Richardson 2010). Grierson Springs did play a part in the selection of an outpost for
Fort Concho, however, and Camp Grierson was established in 1878 to assist in the forced removal of the
Native American population from the region. Grierson and his troops abandoned the camp in 1882,
moving on to Fort Davis. Settlers began to arrive near the springs in the 1890s, and near Big Lake in the
early 1900s. Settlers developed a farming economy until the early 1920s, when the Big Lake oilfield
began producing oil (Smith 2010a). This oilfield, located on University of Texas lands, opened the
Permian basin to oil construction and tract leasing (Smith 2010b). Agriculture and oil production have
remained the economic mainstays of Reagan County through the mid-twentieth century (Smith 2010a).

Methods
Records Review

Prior to fieldwork, a Pape-Dawson archaeologist performed a literature review to learn whether any
previously recorded cultural resources were located within 0.62 miles (1 km) of the project area. The
archaeologist consulted the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas Historic Sites Atlas, Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, the National Register of Historic Places database, as well as site records and
maps at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) to determine whether any National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listed properties, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), Official State of Texas Historic Markers (OTHMs), archaeological sites, and
archaeological surveys are located within 1 km of the project area. The archaeologist also reviewed soils
and geology data for the project area.

Fieldwork

On May 14, 2014, a Pape-Dawson archaeologist led a field crew in a pedestrian survey of the project
Area. Representatives from the University Lands System (ULS) and from Devon were also present. The
crew walked transects spaced 30 m apart over the entire project area; while in the field, ULS and Devon
representatives observed the original location for the frac pond had been modified with a large berm of
dirt that could prove a challenge for removal. As a result, Devon shifted the frac pond location east of
the road to abut the well pads. Archaeologists only surveyed this new project area in addition to the
well pads. They also excavated five judgmentally placed shovel tests within the project area to confirm
8

soils were intact and to learn whether buried deposits existed at site 41RG383. These shovel tests
measured 30 cm by 30 cm and terminated when soils became too compact to excavate further. Soils
from shovel tests were screened through ¼” mesh hardware.
Sites have been recorded on TexSite forms and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) to obtain trinomials. Diagnostic artifacts would have been collected in the field if any
had been observed. Paperwork will be curated at TARL.

Results
Previously recorded sites

There are no previously recorded archaeological sites, NRHP listed properties, SALs, RTHLs, or OTHMs
within the proposed project area. One archaeological survey, a large-scale reconnaissance survey that
Turpin and Sons (TAS) undertook from 2010-2012, crosses the project area (see Appendix). Within 0.62
miles (1 km) of the project area, there are 6 previously recorded archaeological sites, 41RG91, 41RG144,
41RG147, 41RG155, 41RG205, and 41RG210. These sites were recorded as part of the TAS survey, and
all were subject to pedestrian survey with no shovel testing.
Recorded in 2010, site 41RG91 is an open campsite containing fire cracked rocks (FCR), hearths, and
lithics. It is located approximately 0.48 miles (0.77 km) southwest of the proposed project. While the site
is recorded as a surface find, the site form indicates there are buried hearths present, at least one of
which was eroding at the time of survey. No diagnostic artifacts were observed, and no further work
was recommended. Near site 41RG91 is 41RG144, which is located approximately 0.58 miles (0.94 km)
southwest of the project area. This site contained lithic tools, flakes, two burned rock middens, five
buried hearths, five dispersed hearths, and five partially buried hearths. While no diagnostics were
observed, TAS archaeologists recommended the site be avoided or investigated further if avoidance is
not possible. Site 41RG147 is located approximately 0.40 miles (0.64 km) northeast of the proposed
project area, and consists of a surface lithic scatter of cores and flakes. Recorded in 2012 by TAS, no
diagnostic artifacts were observed and no further work was recommended. Archaeological site
41RG155 is located approximately 0.15 miles (0.24 km) northwest of the proposed project area. This site
contained nondiagnostic lithic tools and flakes, as well as around 30 hearths, a number of which were
estimated to contain buried material. At the time of survey, archaeologists estimated it was about 25%
intact, but was subject to erosion. They recommended avoidance or further investigation if avoidance is
not possible. Located approximately 0.62 miles (1 km) southwest of the proposed project, site 41RG210
is an open campsite consisting of lithic cores, flakes, and FCR. No diagnostics were observed, and no
hearths or FCR patterning was evident. As a result, TAS recommended no further work at this site. Site
41RG210 is an open campsite that TAS recorded in 2010; while an eroding hearth was present,
archaeologists only observed a chert scraper and two flakes. Due to this limited assemblage, TAS
recommended the site receive no further investigation.

Fieldwork

Ground cover in the project area is relatively sparse; the landscape is dotted with mesquite and other
small, scrubby vegetation; visibility is about 75% (Figures 3 and 4). The field crew walked the project
area in transects spaced 30 m apart, visually inspecting the ground surface for artifacts or features. The
crew also excavated five shovel tests which were placed judgmentally within the project area; these
shovel tests confirmed the soils are intact. Archaeological survey of the project area resulted in the
recordation of one archaeological site, 41RG383 (see Appendix). This site is located within the footprint
of one of the well pads, approximately 11 m (35 ft) south of a temporary road.

Site Descriptions

Archaeologists recorded one site, 41RG383, within the project area. This site measures approximately
25 m by 30 m, and is situated on a gentle slope with a small, dry runoff pathway or stream bisecting the
site (Figure 5). The site itself consists of two hearths, a flake, and a preform. Hearth 1 measures
approximately 31.5 in (80 cm) east-west by 36.6 in (93 cm) north-south, and consists of a small group of
FCR (Figure 6). A shovel test excavated at the southeast edge of the hearth, ST 5, was sterile. The shovel
test measured 30 cm x 30 cm in diameter and extended approximately 12.2 in (31 cm) in depth before
being terminated due to the compact soils. The shovel test was consistent with soil survey data,
although there was no distinct horizon shift to subsoil. The shovel test soil was a uniform 10YR 5/3
brown silty clay loam (Figure 7).

Hearth 2 is 10.2 in (26 cm) north-south and 16.1 in (41 cm) east-west (Figure 8). Slightly less scattered
than Hearth 1, the fire cracked rock comprising this feature is north of the dry stream rivulet.
Archaeologists did not observe any artifacts in direct association with this feature, and a shovel test, ST
1, excavated on the north side of the feature, did not produce any cultural material or buried fire
cracked rock. The shovel test stratigraphy was similar to that of ST 5 although it had fewer limestone
cobbles; this shovel test was approximately 14.6 in (37 cm) deep (Figure 9).

Artifacts Observed

Only two artifacts were observed at this site: a chert preform and a chert flake. The preform was
pinkish-red in color (although it did not appear to be heat treated) and rectangular in shape (Figure 10).
None of the edges showed signs of wear. The flake was gray and showed no signs of utilization (Figure
11). Since neither of these artifacts was diagnostic, archaeologists did not collect them in the field.
The lack of buried feature components and the intact Cretceous-age soils within the project area
suggest that the site does not have intact buried deposits associated with the features. In addition, the
lack of diagnostic artifacts and the paucity of artifacts associated with this site suggests there is little
potential to gain additional information or insight from this archaeological site. As a result, this site is
not recommended to be a State Antiquities Landmark.

Archaeologists excavated judgmental shovel tests to learn whether the soils in the project area were
intact. Five shovel tests throughout the project area showed that soils appear to be intact. Shovel tests
also confirmed that the hearths found at site 41RG383 did not appear to have buried components, but
had remained on the surface with relatively little soil accumulation for several hundred years. Table 2
lists the shovel test results.

Summary and Recommendations
The intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed well pad and frac pond located one previously
unrecorded archaeological site, site 41RG383. This site consists of two small hearths and two artifacts;
two shovel tests excavated at the site demonstrated the site does not have a buried component. Neither
artifact at this site was diagnostic, and neither was collected.
The soils in the project area indicate that most archaeological sites would be at or near the surface; the
25% ground cover provided excellent visibility, and five shovel tests placed within the project area
confirmed that the Cretaceous-aged soils are intact. No previously recorded archaeological sites are
within the project area, and only one new site, 41RG383, is within the Project Area. Archaeologists
mapped, photographed and recorded the site, and filed a site form on TexSite. Due to the paucity of
artifacts observed in association with site 41RG383, in addition to the lack of a buried component, the
principal investigator recommends the site as not eligible as a State Antiquities Landmark, and that no
further archaeological work at this site is necessary. Upon acceptance of the final report, all paperwork
will be curated at TARL.
