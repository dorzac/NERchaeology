MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 23 July 2007, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) of the proposed Woodland
Acres Flood Mitigation Project. The Jefferson County Drainage District No. 6 (JCDD6) is
proposing this flood mitigation project in order to alleviate frequent home and business flooding
that is caused by a combination of intense rainfall and inadequate outfall during rain events in
the City of Beaumont, Jefferson County, Texas. The proposed Woodland Acres Flood
Mitigation Project will consist of the construction of 3 small detention basins on 3 separate tracts
totaling 36.6 acres. The solution of the detention basins for flood control will address the flood
problems by holding a large volume of water that runs off the upper part of the watershed. It will
also allow the drainage system below the basin to function more efficiently during rain events.
As JCDD6 is considered to be a subdivision of the State of Texas, the project falls under
the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The project will ultimately be funded by
a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and, as such, it also falls
under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966,
as amended. JCDD6 contracted with Horizon to conduct an intensive pedestrian survey of the
project’s APE in compliance with the regulations of the TAC and Section 106 of the NHPA.
Horizon conducted the survey under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit No. 4972. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were located within the APE,
and, if so, to determine their eligibility for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks
(SALs) and for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The survey of the proposed Woodland Acres Flood Mitigation Project resulted in entirely
negative findings. Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the
proposed detention basins, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed Woodland Acres Flood
Mitigation Project will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further
investigations are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted
for the undertaking.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey conducted
for Jefferson County Drainage District No. 6’s (JCDD6) proposed Woodland Acres Flood
Mitigation Project. JCDD6 is proposing this flood mitigation project in order to alleviate frequent
home and business flooding that is caused by a combination of intense rainfall and inadequate
outfall during rain events in the City of Beaumont, Jefferson County, Texas. The proposed
Woodland Acres Flood Mitigation Project will consist of the construction of 3 small detention
basins on 3 separate, but nearby, tracts (Figures 1 and 2). The smallest tract (Tract 1)
measures 5.36 acres. Tract 2 measures 15.59 acres, and Tract 3 measures 15.71 acres. In all,
the 3 tracts total an Area of Potential Effect (APE) of 36.6 acres. The solution of the detention
basins for flood control will address the flood problems by holding a large volume of water that
runs off the upper part of the watershed. It will also allow the drainage system below the basin
to function more efficiently during rain events.
As JCDD6 is considered to be a subdivision of the State of Texas, the project falls under
the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The project will ultimately be funded by
a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and, as such, it also falls
under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966,
as amended. JCDD6 contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct
an intensive pedestrian survey of the project’s APE in compliance with the regulations of the
ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. Horizon conducted the survey under Texas Antiquities
Committee Permit No. 4972. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural
resources were located within the APE, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for formal
designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and for inclusion on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the APE, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State
Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal Investigator for the
project. Jared Wiersema and Michael Mudd (Horizon field technicians) conducted the field
investigations on 23 July 2008.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The initial archival review conducted for the project revealed that the northernmost
proposed basin (Tract 3) is situated within a larger, previously surveyed area where negative
results were produced. Based on the negative results produced by the previous survey, it is
Horizon’s opinion that this area does not warrant additional survey efforts and, as such, was
excluded from the current survey efforts.
The survey of the remaining areas (Tracts 1 and 2) of the proposed Woodland Acres
Flood Mitigation Project resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were
observed on the surface of either of these 2 areas or within any of the 15 shovel tests excavated
within them. Based on the negative results of the current and previous cultural resources
surveys of the proposed Woodland Acres Flood Mitigation Project, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the proposed project will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further
investigations are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be
granted for the undertaking.

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area is located in northwestern Beaumont, Jefferson County, Texas. It can
be found on the US Geologic Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Voth, Texas, topographic quadrangle
(see Figure 1). The APE of the proposed detention basins consists of 3 tracts measuring a
combined total of 36.6 acres. The smallest tract (Tract 1) measures 5.36 acres. Tract 2
measures 15.59 acres, and Tract 3 measures 15.71 acres. All 3 tracts are situated in relative
proximity to one another, just east of where US Highway 69 intersects with a Lower Neches
Valley Authority (LNVA) canal. General photographs of the APE are presented in Figures 3
through 5.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The area covered by JCDD6 is located in southeast Texas. Jefferson County is
bounded on the north by the Neches River and Pine Island Bayou, which form the border with
Hardin and Orange counties; on the east by Sabine Lake, which forms the border with Cameron
Parish, Louisiana; on the south by the Gulf of Mexico; and on the west by Liberty and Chambers
counties. Ground surface elevations across JCDD6 vary from 37 feet to 3 feet above mean sea
level. The topography is described as nearly flat prairie, and the geologic structure is nearly flat
strata. The proposed project consists of 3 new detention basins that will enlarge the hydraulic
capacity and effectively alleviate the flooding conditions, allowing water to flow more effectively
into the nearby LNVA canal. This canal intersects with Island Bayou, which empties into the
Neches River a short distance to the northeast of the current APE. The Neches River flows
southerly into Sabine Lake and Sabine Pass and into the Gulf of Mexico.

2.3

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologic development of the Texas Coastal Plain began approximately 220 million years
ago during the early Mesozoic Era with the separation of the North American and European
continental plates. This Gulfian cycle consisted of several periods of continental extension
(rifting) and compression. During the Triassic, discontinuous rift basins were formed that were
generally oriented parallel to the edge of the developing ocean basin and extended from Mexico
to Nova Scotia. Later, as continental separation continued, the rift basins in Texas were
eventually filled by deposits of marine salt. Subsequent burial by river sediment carried in from

the newly emerging Rocky Mountains caused instability and deformation in the buried salt
layers. This led to an upward migration of the salt deposits to a lower confining pressure,
forming a variety of structures collectively known as salt domes. These structures, which are
prominent subsurface features of the Texas Gulf Coast region, formed significant oil and natural
gas traps in the sedimentary rocks that immediately surround them. Additionally, rapid
deposition of deltaic sands over marine mud resulted in an unstable sediment column, leading
to displacement of the sediments by growth faults (large, curved faults that formed during
sediment accumulation and continue to grow with increasing depth of burial). Linear zones of
growth faults of various ages extend from northeastern Mexico into Louisiana and compose
traps for large oil and gas fields (TSHA 2005).
A review of existing literature indicates that the proposed project is located in an area of
outcropping sediments belonging to the Beaumont Formation (UT-BEG 1992). In the region,
the Beaumont Formation consists of varying proportions of clays, silts, and sands originating
from primarily stream channel, point-bar, natural levee, backswamp, and, to a lesser extent,
coastal marsh and mud-flat depositional systems. Concretions of calcium carbonate, iron oxide,
and iron-manganese oxides are common in the weathered zone. The surface topography of the
region tends to be characterized by relict river channels shown by meander patterns and pimple
mounds on meanderbelt ridges.
The Woodland Acres Flood Mitigation Project is located on soils mapped as LabelleUrban land complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes (NRCS 2008). The Labelle-Urban land complex is

described as very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils which have 0 to
1% slopes.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21county area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 200 kilometers (km) (124 miles) inland from the Texas gulf coastline. In broad
terms, much of the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between
the Southern Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995;
Story 1990). Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin
subregions of Southeast Texas. These 2 subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the
inland subregion has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast
Texas comprises a zone about 25 km (16 miles) inland from the coast that covers the area
influenced by gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable
ecological variability characterizes this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes,
wetlands, marine coastline, and barrier islands. The inland subregion also encompasses
considerable ecological diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney
woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to
denote Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural
characteristics of Southeast Texas cultural periods are often different than in neighboring
regions. For instance, the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and
Southeast Texas, and Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for
Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time
in Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit
evidence of reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be
associated with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of
subsistence-related activities. Inland sites tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired
clay balls (at some sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites
tend to consist of multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain oyster shell tools, large
quantities of pottery (in later cultural components), numerous bone tools, and few lithic
materials.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5000 BC)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 BC (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (but see Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is
represented by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 BC) (Patterson 1995). This stage
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end
scrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas
are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is
little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced during all prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 BC), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian
period (8000 to 5000 BC), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).
3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5000 BC TO AD 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 BC to AD 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas.
Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and
corresponding decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a
diversified resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas,
however, this hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The
appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone
assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural

10

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Woodland Acres Flood Mitigation Project

stage. Material culture shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in
the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 BC) is marked by the presence of
Bell, Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The
Bell point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains.
Many of the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 BC) and
several new types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and
probably the Gary-Kent series. The Late Archaic period (1500 BC to AD 100) is characterized
by Gary, Kent, Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition
developed in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981;
Patterson 1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period
but reached full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as
boatstones and bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang
knives, stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial
practices included the systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre,
and use of locally made grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most
burials are found in extended supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials
are also known. Burial direction is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to
site. Patterson et al. (1993) report that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary
tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (AD 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 BC, in the Galveston Bay area by
about AD 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about AD 300, and in the ConroeLivingston inland area by about AD 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears to have
progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995).
Southeastern Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where
Aten (1983) established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area
129 km (80 miles) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal exception of
a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf
coast west of the Sabine Lake area.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and early part of the Historic period (Aten
1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility ware
throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown Plain
for about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods
before once again becoming predominant in the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety,
Goose Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor
pottery types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway
(Aten 1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte
types are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste
(like Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (AD 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (AD 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the
latter part of the Late Prehistoric period, but, as previously discussed, ceramics appear earlier in
Southeast Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion along with the bow and arrow through the
Late Prehistoric period (Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995;
Wheat 1953). In fact, Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in
Southeast Texas as early as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points
that consisted of marginally retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a
generalized date of adoption of the bow-and-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca.
AD 600) in Central and Southeast Texas. In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to
be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba,
Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. A serial sequence for these point types has not been
established in Southeast Texas, though Scallorn points appear to predate Perdiz points
throughout the rest of Texas.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto
Plain and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek
pottery remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt
Coated pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (AD 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue.
Aten (1983) has
reconstructed the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century,
including the Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco/Karankawa, and Tonkawa. The presence of the
Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central Texas in the
17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought to have
occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the
corresponding mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east
of the San Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe
may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic period
(Patterson et al. 1993; Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in
identifying Historic Indian sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and
possibly Fresno and Cuney points after AD 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites
are usually identified by the presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types
of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (AD 1700 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near
Galveston Bay; however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where
the burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the
time heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous
Indian population was greatly diminished. The Alabama/Coushatta Indians who currently reside
in Southeast Texas are migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early
19th centuries (Newcomb 1961).
Prehistoric habitation in the future Jefferson County began with the arrival of Atakapa
Indians roughly 2,000 years ago. The Atakapas lived on the Lower Neches and Sabine rivers.
In 1746, they occupied 2 villages on opposite sides of the Neches near the site of present-day
Beaumont. Orcoquiza Indians occupied the area from the Neches River to halfway between the
Trinity and the Brazos rivers. Six burial mounds have been discovered at Joseph Grigsby’s
plantation at Port Neches on the west bank of the Neches 12 miles below Beaumont, and

HJN 080094 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

pottery sherds have been found at Sabine Lake and in many places throughout the area. The
disappearance of the Indians has been attributed to migration and/or smallpox epidemics; most
were gone by the 1820s, when the first EuroAmerican settlers arrived.
The French and Spanish disputed ownership of the future county during the
18th century. Spanish claims were based on the 1528 expedition of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca, and French involvement began with La Salle in 1685. By 1730, French fur traders had
crossed the lower Sabine to trade with the Orcoquizas on the Trinity River; however, the area
that became Jefferson County was rarely visited by EuroAmerican traders because it was
bounded on the east by unfordable rivers and bayous and on the north by the Big Thicket. To
prevent French penetration, the Spanish established San Agustín de Ahumada Presidio and
Nuestra Señora de la Luz Mission near the mouth of the Trinity in 1756. In 1777, Antonio Gil
Ibarbo conducted an expedition to investigate the English presence in Spanish territory, and, in
1785, José de Evia camped at Sabine Pass and mapped Sabine Lake and the Sabine and
Neches rivers. By 1803, when the US acquired Louisiana, the area of Jefferson County was
under Spanish control as part of the Atascosito District. In conjunction with filibustering efforts
to discourage Spanish shipping after 1816, the area provided a path for slave smuggling
between Louisiana, Point Bolivar, Jefferson County, and the Sabine River until the 1830s. Pirate
Jean Laffite maintained a slave barracks on the Sabine River 10 miles north of the site of
present Orange to house black slaves in transit. In 1821, filibustering efforts ceased when the
Treaty of Córdova ended Spanish ownership in the region and made it part of Mexico. AngloAmerican colonization subsequently met both hostility and encouragement from the Mexican
government, as settlement efforts brought new families to the area from 1821 to 1836. The first
settlement within the confines of the present county, established at Tevis Bluff in 1824, became
the City of Beaumont. The area that became Jefferson County was included in the Mexican
Department of Nacogdoches as part of the Liberty Municipality in Lorenzo de Zavala’s
empresario grant of 1831. It later became part of the Jefferson Municipality. The Cow Bayou
settlement in this municipality, organized in 1835 and later known as Old Jefferson, became the
first county seat and the focal point of future growth in the county. Local volunteers took part in
the Texas Revolution, and other residents provided troop support.
Jefferson County, formed in 1836 and organized in 1837, was one of the original
counties in the Republic of Texas. It was named for the municipality that preceded it, which was
in turn named for Thomas Jefferson. The county’s boundaries, as delineated on 21 December
1837, included all of the future Orange County, a part of what later became Hardin County, and
the extreme eastern part of the future Chambers County. The first county seat, Jefferson, or
Old Jefferson, on the east bank of Cow Bayou, was replaced by Beaumont in 1838 and had
disappeared by 1845, when the site of Orange was surveyed. Orange was first called Jefferson
or New Jefferson. In 1836, Claiborne West, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence,
served as first postmaster and merchant at Old Jefferson. Another chief town was Sabine Pass,
laid out in 1839 with the backing of Sam Houston and Philip A. Sublett. Early settlers, primarily
from the lower South, were joined by Cajuns in the 1840s and by immigrants from the North and
from Europe in the 1850s. The area became an ethnic conglomerate. The Cajuns settled near
Taylor’s Bayou, and the Germans settled in the center of the county.

By the 1840s, shingle manufacture and timber exports supplemented a domestic
economy based on spinning, leatherwork, and soap and candle making. Shipbuilding, which
grew from the lumber industry before 1850, took place next to the lumber mills in Sabine Pass
and Beaumont. Steam-driven industry developed in 1846, and the first steam sawmill in
Beaumont was established in 1856. Jefferson County’s land was better suited to livestock
raising than to a cotton-based plantation economy. By 1820, Louisiana cattlemen drove herds
across the Sabine and Neches rivers to graze on Gulf Coast saltgrasses, and a system of roads
and ferries running from east to west across the county was slowly put in place to support
movement of the herds. In the antebellum period, some cattlemen settled permanently and
pursued their livelihood alongside small farmers. Leather shops and tanneries developed in
Beaumont in the 1840s, and shoe shops, saddleries, and exporters of hides and tallow followed
in the 1850s. Cotton-buying and ginning began by 1850 and increased with the arrival of the
Eastern Texas Railroad, though production in 1859 was only 84 bales and not much of the
potential agricultural land had been improved. Stephen L. Smith, the county’s most diversified
planter in the 1840s, raised corn, sweet potatoes, and rice. Early rice culture, the forerunner of
the county’s largest farm enterprise, produced 1,000 pounds in 1859. The Texas and New
Orleans Railroad from Houston to Orange and the Eastern Texas Railroad from Sabine Pass to
Beaumont were completed by 1861, but insufficient rail transportation and high freight rates
limited antebellum growth. Sabine Pass became a boomtown, stimulated by the Morgan Lines,
which established operations there before the Civil War. Four firms at Sabine shipped
20,000 bales of cotton annually, and 300 vessels cleared the Sabine customhouse in 1859.
Though the county was prosperous in the 1850s, and resolution of the (Orange County)
Regulator-Moderator War in Jefferson County courts stabilized growth in that decade,
Beaumont had only 4 commission and forwarding houses, 4 dry-goods stores, 2 groceries,
2 hotels, and a population of 400 by 1858.
Jefferson County residents voted 256 for and 15 against secession. During the Civil
War, the county court voted to garrison a fort at Sabine Pass, Beaumont became a
concentration point for Confederate troops, a cantonment was established at Spindletop
Springs, and the county courthouse served as a hospital. Among the county’s several volunteer
groups, the Sabine Pass Guard was organized at Sabine Pass in April 1861 under the Texas
legislative act of 1858 that authorized the state militia. Beginning in 1862, federal troops burned
cavalry barracks near Sabine Pass, along with a railroad depot, sawmills, a planing mill, a sash
and door factory, and the palatial homes of D.R. Wingate and John Stamps. They also shelled
Sabine City, then suffering an epidemic of yellow fever. The Confederates reoccupied Sabine
Pass in January 1863, and the battle of Sabine Pass in September of that year ended federal
efforts to penetrate the interior via the Sabine. The war caused considerable losses, and farm
acreage and value declined, cotton exports fell, and the number of cattle in the county dropped
from 51,600 in 1862 to 40,000 in 1865.
Recovery from the war was slow. Jefferson County exports in 1867 of cotton, cattle,
beef hides, lumber, cypress shingles, and lumber products, including resin and turpentine,
constituted only about 1/4 of their prewar total. Sugar production between 1860 and 1880 was
limited, and significant agriculture did not develop again until after 1890. By 1876, however, the
county was once again a lumber and shipping center, as loggers used the Neches and Sabine

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

rivers to float logs to mills at Orange and Beaumont, where 82 million shingles and 75 million
board feet of timber were manufactured by 1880. Exports, including pine for cross-ties and
bridges, made these towns major lumber centers by 1900. Four canal systems for irrigating rice
were built between 1898 and 1902, including the Port Arthur Rice and Irrigation Company,
McFaddin Canal Company, Jefferson County Irrigation Company (later renamed Beaumont
Irrigation Company), and Treadaway Canal Company (later renamed Neches Canal Company).
By 1904, 50,000 acres were under cultivation as mule power replaced ox teams.
After 1880, rail transportation increased significantly. The Texas and New Orleans (now
the Southern Pacific Transportation Company) built from Houston to Orange in 1860,
abandoned its Orange County track in 1863 and the line in 1867, and then rebuilt in 1876. This
railroad was linked to the Louisiana and Western and through service to New Orleans in 1881.
By 1881, service had also been reestablished by the East Texas Railway, which was renamed
the Sabine and East Texas and later became part of the Texas and New Orleans. The Gulf,
Beaumont and Kansas City Railway, constructed between 1893 and 1896, ran at first neither to
the Gulf nor to Kansas City, but only from Kirbyville to Beaumont. The Gulf and Interstate
developed in 1895, and the Beaumont, Sour Lake and Western Railway between 1903 and
1904. Port Arthur, founded in 1895 by Arthur Edward Stilwell, was linked in 1895 by the Kansas
City Southern to Beaumont. Service to Kansas City finally came in 1897, when the Sabine
River bridge was completed.
The Sabine-Neches or Port Arthur Ship Canal was excavated in 1897 and 1898 from
Sabine Pass to Port Arthur. It opened in 1899 and was gradually extended to the mouths of the
Neches and Sabine Rivers. The first oceangoing vessel to call at Beaumont and Orange was
the Nicaragua, which arrived in 1906. River depths were increased to around 25 feet by 1920,
by which time the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway had crossed the southern part of the county.
Interurban service from Nederland to Beaumont and Port Arthur linked those communities in
1913, and, by 1916, completion of the channel to Beaumont from Port Arthur and the mouth of
the Neches had further increased lumber exports.
Between 1900 and 1910, the population grew from 14,329 to 38,182. A major influx
followed the Spindletop oilfield’s opening in 1901, and the decade’s growth came almost
exclusively from the white population of Hardin, Tyler, Jasper, and Newton counties. Significant
Cajun French movement to Jefferson County began in 1910 when the boll weevil destroyed
cotton crops in parishes adjacent to Lafayette, Louisiana. In addition, a small influx of Mexicans
reached Jefferson County beginning in 1917 and 1918 as refinery workers were drafted in
World War I. By 1920, the county’s population reached 73,120, nearly double the 1910 figure.
Spindletop transformed Beaumont into a major industrial center. Refineries, including
the Texas Company refinery of Joseph S. Cullinan and Arnold Schlaet (1902) and the Gulf Oil
Corporation (now Chevron) refinery were built at Port Arthur, Port Neches, and Beaumont.
During World War I, shipbuilding increased, and the Magnolia Petroleum Company (now
ExxonMobil) refinery on the Neches at Beaumont played an active role as a supplier for the war.
Between 1955 and 1960, the Texaco and Gulf refineries employed 5,000 to 6,000 workers, and,
by World War II, the Gulf refinery was the 14th largest refinery in the world. Farm tenancy,
which increased significantly in Jefferson County in the first decade of the 20th century, declined
16

briefly, but increased so much during the Great Depression that owners and tenant farmers
achieved almost equal numbers. By 1930, the average farm size had fallen to roughly
250 acres. In the 1930s, however, despite the hardships experienced in many areas, Jefferson
County was one among several Texas counties that continued to prosper. The county shipped
29,022,201 tons of materials through Beaumont, Sabine Pass, and Port Arthur in 1934; and the
following year produced 1,304,495 barrels of crude petroleum, crops valued at $1,866,873, and
livestock valued at $1,511,061. In 1930, the county had 141 manufacturing establishments with
products valued at more than $297 million. In 1938, the county exported clay and shells and
raised 2.2 million bushels of rice on 40,000 acres of irrigated land as well as 1,000 bales of
cotton, corn, other feed crops, figs, and truck crops. Livestock totals included 100,000 beef
cattle as well as dairy cattle, hogs, poultry, sheep, and goats. In foreign and coastal trade,
Beaumont and Port Arthur shipped oil, cotton, lumber, and other products. Industries included
oil refining, ship building, rice milling, food processing, and the manufacture of machinery,
chemicals, garments, and crates. The Rainbow Bridge over the Neches River from Port Arthur
to southern Orange County was completed in 1938; with a vertical clearance of 176 feet over
the water, it was the South’s tallest highway bridge.
In the 1940s, 26% of Jefferson County’s farmers were tenants. Because of the
importance of rice and beef production, the Texas Rice Improvement Association, Texas A&M
College, and the US Department of Agriculture established an experiment station for the
improvement of rice and pasture cultivation as a joint project at Pine Island.
The world’s largest synthetic rubber plant, Neches Butane Products Company (now
Texaco Chemical), was built at Port Neches in 1942. By 1949, the county had become highly
industrialized and urbanized, with 3 rice mills, 14 producing oilfields, 11 tank farms, and 6 oil
refineries having total production capacities of more than 1/2 million barrels daily. New industry
arrived as plants were established for the production of chemicals and petrochemicals. During
World War II, the growth of shipbuilding in the Sabine-Neches Waterway brought in such firms
as Bethlehem Steel, Gulfport, Weaver, Burton, and Jones and Laughlin.
In the 1950s, the Spindletop field was still active, Gulf Oil laid pipelines, a new oilfield
was developed at Hillebrandt Bayou, and sulfur mining began. The nickname applied to
Orange, Port Arthur, and Beaumont, the “Golden Triangle,” symbolized the close relationship
that had grown up among the cities. Gulf State Utilities Company supplied electric power for
much of Southeast Texas and southern Louisiana. In 1956, roughly 26 million tons of materials
were shipped from the county’s inland ports, including rice, cotton, rubber products, steel, sugar,
flour, oil, and oil products.
In 1960, the economy continued to be based on significant agricultural production but
was dominated by Beaumont and Port Arthur, which together had become a commercial
banking center as well as a major chemical and petroleum products manufacturing center. Port
Neches was the site of the Atlantic, Gulf, and Texaco refineries. Gambling and prostitution,
which had expanded in the area, were driven out in 1961. By the 1970s, rice and cattle were
the chief agricultural products, soybeans had been introduced, and residents were employed in
the petrochemical, shipbuilding, and rubber industries.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

In the 1980s, the county was one of the most densely populated in the state. Ninety-four
percent of its roughly 250,900 residents lived in urban areas. Manufacturing establishments,
numbering 235, made products valued at more than $2 billion dollars in a single year, and a
total of 5,318 business establishments operated countywide. In the early 1990s, Lamar
University and Lamar University – Port Arthur provided higher education in Jefferson County. A
new county jail and a new state prison, the Mark Stiles Unit, opened, and a new unit of the
federal prison system was under construction. The South Texas State Fair was held annually in
October. Duck hunting and saltwater fishing, along with the J.D. Murphree Wildlife Refuge,
attracted sportsmen to the area. Tourists visited a restored boomtown at Spindletop in Gladys
City, a monument commemorating Richard Dowling’s Confederate victory during the Civil War
in Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Park, and the Tex Ritter Park and memorial at
Nederland. Annual events included the Heritage Festival at Nederland in March, the Neches
River Festival in Beaumont in April, the Beaumont Jazz Festival in July, Spindletop Boom Days
at Beaumont in September, the South Texas Fair at Beaumont in October, the Saltwater
Anglers Fishing Tourney at Port Arthur in May, and Port Arthur’s “CavOILcade.”

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
web site (Atlas) indicated no recorded archeological sites or historic structures within a 1.0-km
(0.6-mile) radius of any of the 3 proposed detention basin locations (THC 2006) (Figure 6). The
archival review did indicate the presence of the Spell Cemetery several hundred feet to the
southwest of Tract 2 (see Figure 6). This cemetery contains a historical marker with the
following text:
The land on which this graveyard is located was designated a family cemetery in 1873 by
the Marble family. The earliest known burial is that of Martha Marble (d. 1864), whose
husband John S. Marble was also buried here in 1873. Their daughter and son-in-law,
Noley and David E. Spell, owned the land until 1924, when it was officially designated a
cemetery in county deed records. Notable local citizens interred here include Sam H.
Tevis and Daniel Comstock. A cemetery association, organized in 1983 by Spell family
descendants, maintains the historic graveyard.

No recorded archeological sites, historic structures, or cemeteries are located within or
immediately adjacent to the boundaries of any of the 3 proposed detention basin locations.
Based on the Atlas data, the northernmost detention basin (Tract 3) is contained within the area
of a larger, previous cultural resources survey that produced negative results (see Figure 6).
Unfortunately, no data other than locational data for this survey were available on the Atlas. No
formal cultural resources surveys have been undertaken within the other 2 proposed detention
basins.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the 2 previously unsurveyed tracts (Tracts 1 and 2) comprising the proposed Woodland Acres
Flood Mitigation Project on 23 July 2008. This included intensive surface inspection and
subsurface shovel tests within the 21 acres comprising the 2 unsurveyed tracts. The Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres
for acreage projects of this size. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by
excavating a total of 15 shovel tests within the 21-acre APE of the 2 previously unsurveyed
tracts. Because the northernmost tract (Tract 3) had been previously surveyed with negative
results, it was Horizon’s opinion that it did not warrant additional survey efforts and, as such,
was excluded from the current survey efforts.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate.
The location of each shovel test was recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 7.
Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The initial archival review conducted for the project revealed that the northernmost tract
(Tract 3) is situated within a larger, previously surveyed area where negative results were
produced. Based on the negative results produced by the previous survey, it is Horizon’s
opinion that this area does not warrant additional survey efforts and, as such, was excluded
from the current survey efforts.
The survey of the remaining areas of the proposed Woodland Acres Flood Mitigation
Project (Tracts 1 and 2) resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were
observed on the surface of either of these 2 areas or within any of the 15 shovel tests excavated
within them.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the current and previous cultural resources surveys of
the proposed Woodland Acres Flood Mitigation Project, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed
the project will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations
are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the
undertaking.
