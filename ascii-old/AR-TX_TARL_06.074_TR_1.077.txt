ABSTRACT
During the months of June and July 1979, the Texas
Archeological Survey, the University of Texas at Austin,
carried out a program of cultural resource survey, sampling
and assessment in an area to be modified by construction of
the Twin Oak Steam Electric Generating Station in northcen tra l Robertson County, Texas.
Sponsored by Texas Utilities
Services, Inc., this program was designed to inventory and
assess the cultural resources within a 5,000 acre tract
proposed for lignite surface mining and to sample the cultural
~cmains at two sites, 41RT10 and 41RT11, which had been
recorded in 1974 by TAS during a survey of the Twin Oak plant
site.
Twenty prehistoric and one historic sites were recorded.
The prehistoric sites are primarily light lithic scatters
located on sandy knolls near a permanent water supply.
The
artifact assemblages are limited in quantity and variety;
chert is noticeably scarce.
Natural and man-made disturbances
are common to all these sites; eight are considered to be
sufficiently intact to merit subsurface testing.
The historic
site, a log cabin constructed in 1840, is intact; avoidance
or preservation is warranted.
Subsurface testing of 41RT10 gained a representative
sample of the cultural remains which, in sections of this
site, retained some depositional integrity.
Time-diagnostics
indicative of the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods
were recovered.
Site 41RT11 proved to be totally disrupted
by modern land-use practices.
No further investigation of
either site is recommended.

IrJTRODUCTI ON
Texas Utilities Services, Inc. is cooperating in the
development of a complex of lignite fueled steam electric
stations in Robertson County, Texas. An initial assessment
of the cultural resources to be affected by construction of
plant facilities at the Twin Oak and Oak Knoll projects was
conducted by the Texas Archeological Survey, The University
of Texas at Austin, in 1974 for Texas Utilities Services, Inc.
(Prewitt and Grombacher 1974). Two sites, 41RT10 and RTll,
recorded in the Twin Oak project area during this initial
survey were recommended for subsurface sampling. In 1979,
the Texas Archeological Survey conducted test excavations at
these two s~tes and intensively surveyed an additional 5,000acre tract in north-central Robertson County which is under
consideration for lignite surface ~ining.
The first phase of investigation was intended to test
the cultural deposits to determine the nature of the aboriginal
occupation at these sites and, if these residues were found

to retain depositional integrity, to obtain a representative
sample of them.
The second phase, a reconnaissance level survey of
the proposed mining area, was designed to:
1) determine the precise location and description of
any cultural resources to be directly or indirectly affected
by the proposed mining;
2) evaluate the identified resources in terms of their
scientific or historic value;
3) recommend means to lessen any predictable adverse
effects on identified resources; and
4) recommend additional studies related to the interpretation of these resources which may be beyond the investigative scope of this study.
The field work was conducted during June and July, 1979,
by Texas Archeological Survey staff members, H. G. Wooldridge
and James R. Pliska, under the supervision of Duford W. Skelton.
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The Twin Oaks Lignite Prospect encompasses approximately
5,000 acres of north-central Robertson County (Fig. 1). The
UTM coordinates of the center of the study area are Zone 14,
732500E-3450000N. The northern boundary of the tract runs
parallel to FM 2293 southwest of Petteway, Texas; the nearest
incorporated town is Bremond, eight miles west.
Robertson County is included in Fenneman's (1938: 100102) West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province which is
characterized by gently rolling hills and ridges which rarely
exceed 500 feet MSL. The project area is contained entirely
within the uplands midway between the Brazos and tlavasota
rivers. Elevational relief ranges from 360 to 500 feet MSL.
GEOLOGY
Robertson County is considered to be a part of the Gulf
Coast Tertiary province. The general area is underlain by
the Wilcox Group, Eocene sediments of fluvial origin.
The survey area is underlain by the Calvert Bluff Formation, the upper unit of the Wilcox Group. The formation is
primarily mudstone with varying amounts of sandstone, lignite,
ironstone concretions and local pockets of glauconitic material.
The sandstone component generally forms the low ridges in the
rolling countryside, while the mud and mudstone components
are found in the lower topographic positions.

2

Along Walnut and Duck creeks and their tributaries,
narrow floodplain deposits of alluvium are present, including
low, indistinct terrace deposits.
The survey area is bounded on the northeast and southwest by further Calvert Bluff deposits. To the southeast,
the Eocene Carrizo Sand overlies the Wilcox Group. Northwest
of the survey area, beyond Walnut Creek, the Simsboro Formation,
a lower unit of the Wilcox Group, is exposed (Bureau of
Economic Geology Waco Sheet 1970).
HYDROLOGY
The Carrizo and Wilcox sands form the major aquifer
in Leon and Robertson Counties (Southwest Research Institute
1975). This aquifer, which today supplies water for agricultural irrigation, discharges through seep and springs resulting in streams which are effluent most of the year. During
the course of the survey, these springs were found to be an
excellent indicator of prehistoric occupational remains.
The majority of the study area is drained by Gnats and
Beck creeks, tributaries of Walnut Creek which flows southwest
into the Brazos River. The extreme northeastern section is
drained by Oliver and Herds branches of Duck Creek which flows
southeast to the Navasota River.
SOILS
The bulk of the soils within the Twin Oak project area
are Axtell-Tabor upland and terrace soils derived from the
Wilcox Group sedimentary sequences. These soils are deep,
with extremely slow permeability and fine sandy loam surfaces.
The Nahatche-Thenas soils are found along creek floodplains in the area, where they have developed in the loamy
alluvial sediments. The resulting acid creek soils are moderately permeable with clay loam and fine sandy loam surfaces
(Baker 1979).
CLIMATE
Robertson County is on the western edge of Carr's (1967)
East Texas climatic region. Precipitation maxima occur in
May and December, and the minimum in August. With an average
rainfall of 35 to 38 inches, the resulting pattern is one of
frequent summer drought. Thornthwaite (1948) lists the
moisture surplus index as 0 to 20%, rainfall barely in excess
of water need. However, fluctuations of as much as 20% from
the normal precipitation values occur frequently enough that
such variation may be considered normal. The mean annual
temperature for Robertson County is between 66 and 68 degrees
F., characterizing a fairly mild climate (Carr 1967: 4-8, 10,
l 9) .

VEGETATION
Robertson County is in an area where two major vegetational zones, the Post Oak Savannah and the Blackland Prairie,
meet (Gould 1969). The former area typically includes a tallgrass understory (little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass,
purpletop, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass and species of
Chasmanthium), an overstory composed primarily of post and
blackjack oak, and a variety of brush and weedy species. The
Blackland Prairie should be classed as a true prairie, with
little bluestem as the climax dominant, and big bluestem,
Indiangrass, switchgrass, sideoats and hairy grama, tall
dropseed, silver bluestem and Texas wintergrass as secondary
but important species (Gould 1969: 11). In addition, the
bottomlands along the rivers support a riparian forest which
includes such species as pin oak, elm, hackberry, cottonwood,
ash and pecan (Bennett and Shaw 1909: 6).
The natural environment of Robertson County has been
considerably modified by agricultural activity. Approximately
23% of the county's acreage is under cultivation, producing
primarily cotton, sorghum and various truck crops. Fortysix percent is in range and improved pasture (SWRI 1975: 5),
typically seeded in Bermuda grass, Dallisgrass, Vaseygrass,
carpet grass and clover (Gould 1969: 11). Approximately 27%
of the county is forestetl.
In the Blackland Prairie, mesquite is a frequent invader,
as are Texas wintergrass, buffalograss, Texas grama, smutgrass
and various annuals. In the Post Oak Savannah, invader species
include red lovegrass, broomsedge and splitbeard bluestem,
yankeeweed, bull nettle, green briar, yaupon, smutgrass and
western ragweed.
Within the Twin Oak survey area, the majority of the
land is in old pasture (Fig. 2a), with some areas of improved
pasture and truck crops (Fig. 2b).
FAUNA
Robertson County falls within Blair's (1950: 98, 100102) Texan Biotic Province, in which alluvial river valley
soils support mesic forests, providing an avenue for the
dispersal of various Austroriparian species into the area
from the east. Kansan and other prairie species enter via
the grassy uplands from the west. The Texan Province is,
then, a transitional zone containing no endemic species of
vertebrates.
At least 49 species of mammals occupy, or have recently
occupied, the Texan Province. Forty-one of these are also
found in the Austroriparian province to the east; eight range
into the Texan Province from the grasslands to the west,
southwest or north. Major species, many of which were exploited
by aboriginal populations, include deer, opossum, rabbit,

4

squirrel, various rats, mice and ground squirrels, and the
jaguar and ocelot. The armadillo is common in the area today
but, according to Lundelius (1967: 313), has been in the
region only a few centuries,
Other species found in the Texan Province also reflect
the ecotonal nature of the area. They include two turtles,
16 lizards, 39 snakes, five urodeles and 18 anurans. For a
recent listing of birds and animals sighted in the area, see
the Southwest Research Institute 1 s 1975 Environmental Assessment, pages 35, 36 and Appendix D.
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Prior to 1974 only one archeological site had been
formally reported in Robertson County. The development of
the natural resource potential of this area for the production
of energy resulted in extensive archeological investigations
in the 1970s. Surveys of the Upper flavasota Reservoir area
(now Lake Linestone) conducted by the Texas Archeological
Survey in 1974 resulted in the location of 60 prehistoric
and historic sites, ten of which are in Robertson County
(Prewitt 1974). In the same year, TAS completed the initial
phase of archeological survey of the proposed Twin Oak and
Oak Knoll projects (Prewitt and Grombacher 1974). Sixteen
archeological sites were recorded; four are within the boundaries of the Twin Oak project in Robertson County. Recommendations derived from this initial survey resulted in the testing
of sites 41RT10 and RTll reported herein.
One site in Robertson County had been excavated prior
to the present study - 41RT2, the Louie Sadler site, which is
now inundated by Lake Limestone (Prewitt 1975). However,
other sites within the reservoir in Leon and Limestone counties
have also been sampled and the results reported (Prewitt and
Mallouf 1976; Mallouf 1979).
In 1978 the Texas Archeological Survey surveyed a
sample of two lignite prospects in Robertson County. Random
transects totaling 13.2% of the 80,000 acres under consideration
were intensively examined. Sixty-four prehistoric and 31 historic sites were reported. Three of the prehistoric sites,
41RT13, RT14 and RT15, had been previously located during the
survey of the Upper Navasota Reservoir and two sites contained
both prehistoric and historic occupations.
A total of 105 archeological sites have been reported
in Robertson County prior to the present study. These sites
have been viewed in the context of a four stage culturalchronological framework established for Central Texas. Several
summaries of the development of this cultural scheme have been
presented; a brief description of the salient attributes of
each stage is presented here.

LATE PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (Before 10,000 to 8,000 B.P.)
The Paleoi'ndian Period includes the earliest welldocumented evidence of aboriginal occupation in Central Texas.
Knowledge of the period is based heavily upon surface finds
of lanceolate projectile points, including the Clovis, Folsom,
Scottsbluff, Plainview, Meserve, GoZandrina and Angostura
types. Elsewhere in Texas, such points have been recovered
in direct association with Pleistocene mega-fauna (e.g.,
Dibble and Lorrain 1968), which are generally presumed to
hbve been a major element in the Paleoindian subsistence
strategy. In Central Texas, this association has not been
documented and it has been proposed that the economy of this
period was a more generalized hunting and gathering exploitation
pattern.
ARCHAIC PERIOD (8,000 to 1,250 B.P.)
The chronology of the Archaic Period in Central Texas
has been refined in the course of a number of recent studies
{Weir 1976a, 1976b; Prewitt 1974a, 1974b, 1976, n.d.; Bond
1978) which have synthesized new artifact and radiocarbon assay
data with earlier studies (Kelley 1947, 1959; Jelks 1951; Suhm,
Krieger and Jelks 1954; Johnson 1967). The resulting chronology defines six phases -- Circleville (8,000 to 6,000 B.P.),
San Geronimo (6,000 to 5,000 B.P.), Clear Fork (5,000 to 4,000
B.P.), Round Rock (4,000 to 2,600 B.P.), San Marcos (2,600 to
1,750 B.P.), and Twin Sisters (1 ,750 to 1,250 B.P.) -- which
correspond roughly to the Terminal Paleoindian and the Incipient, Early, Middle, Late and Terminal Archaic of the earlier
chronology.
During the Archaic, a hunting and gathering tradition
developed which was based on adaptation to both widespread
environmental change at the close of the Pleistocene and
specific local ecological variation. Diagnostic artifacts
of the Archaic include barbed and side-notched projectile
points of various types and an increasing number of nonportable
food preparation tools such as manos and metates. The burned
rock midden type sites developed during this period.
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (1 ,250 to 150 B.P.)
The Late Prehistoric Period in Central Texas was a time
of considerable change in both subsistence strategy and material
culture. The bow and arrow was introduced and small arrow type
projectile points are a major diagnostic tool of the period.
Further technological innovations included the manufacture of
ceramics and the development of agriculture, although neither
of these is as widely recognized in Central Texas as in other
parts of the state.

8

The Late Prehistoric Central Texas Aspect has been
subdivided into the Austin and Toyah Foci (Suhm, Krieger and
Jelks 1954). The Austin Focus (1 ,250 to 650 B.P.) is believed
to represent an indigenous development from the late Archaic
population of the area (Stephenson 1970). Particularly useful
artifacts of this time are the Scallorn and Granbury arrowtype projectile points. The Toyah Focus (650 to 150 B.P.)
diagnostics include PePdiz and Cliffton projectile points and
a sandy paste pottery known as Leon Plain.
HISTORIC PERIOD (European contact to present)
The Historic Period is considered to begin with the
arrival of the Europeans in Central Texas. The remains of
both aboriginal and intrusive cultural groups are included
in this period.
SURVEY METHODOLOGY
Prior to the inception of the field survey, an examination of the records of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, the central
repository for archeological site information, and of the
Texas Historical Commission showed no previous archeological
investigations have been conducted within the boundaries of
the proposed lignite surface mining area, and no archeological
sites had been recorded. Assessments of the results of surveys
in similar environmental settings in the general vicinity
indicated prehistoric sites found in this upland environment
are characteristically small, generally found on sandy knolls
close to active springs or other water sources, and surficially
evidenced by lithic debris and fire-cracked rock. Disturbances
common to previously recorded sites are the result of a combination of factors -- historic modification (erosion, plowing,
land clearing and construction) and natural processes (bioturbation of the noncohesive sandy soils).
THE FIELD SURVEY
On June 21, 1979, the field survey was initiated by
Duford W. Skelton and James R. Pliska. Landowners were contacted for access rights and for information about prehistoric
sites in the area.
The prospect was arbitrarily segmented by property
ownership lines. Each section was examined using a combination
of straight-line and meandering transects. Straight-line
transects were used primarily in areas of good surface visibility. Meandering transects, walked in a snakelike pattern,
were used in areas of minimal surface visibility to insure all
natural and artificial exposures were inspected. Transects

9

were generally spaced at 50 to 75 meter i.ntervals depending
on ground cover and terrain. The entire project area was
intensively covered; efforts were concentrated in old fields,
along erosional features and in cleared areas.
Shovel testing, the excavation of small shallow pits
approximately 25 cm. in diameter and from 50 to 75 cm. in
depth, was employed in areas of low surface visibility and
to determine the extent and depth of cultural deposits in
the located areas. Six sites were identified by shovel
testing in areas which previous experience indicated as likely
locations of aboriginal occupation, but which showed no
surficial evidence.
SITE DEFINITION
Criteria for designation as an archeological site were
formed from the preliminary study which strongly suggested
that prehistoric occupation is surficially evidenced by light
scatters of lithic debris and fire-cracked rock. All such
exposures were given site status, with the exception of single
lithic artifacts or limited quantities of cultural debris in
areas where shovel testing failed to reveal additional occupational remains. These isolated finds are indicated on
Figure 4 and described in the site description section, but
they are not considered as potentially important resources.
SITE DOCUMENTATION
Sites located during the survey were documented on
standard University of Texas site survey forms, which include
descriptions of surficial and other exposed features and
residues, with their sizes, types, frequencies, spatial distributions and possible affiliations. Sketch maps were drawn
at all the sites, and photographs were taken to record their
environmental settings. Information on the physiography,
hydrology, vegetation, soil and slope was recorded at each
site, as were active erosional and depositional processes and
other factors which might effect site recognition or integrity.
As sites were recorded, they were assigned temporary
field numbers. At the conclusion of the survey, these were
replaced by the trinomials issued by the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory of The University of .Texas at Austin.
The trinomial system employs a numerical prefix indicating
the state (4l=Texas), two or three letters representing the
county (RT=Robertson), and a numerical suffix which designates
the individual site (108=the 108th site recorded in the county).
Very little artifactual material was collected during
the course of the survey. A few chert flakes and diagnostic
artifacts were collected for comparative purposes. Those
specimens, plus all of the original site documentation, are
on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at
Balcones Research Center, The University of Texas at ~ustin.

RESULTS OF THE SURVEY
HISTORIC RESOURCES
A single historic site was recorded during the field
survey (Fig. 3). 41RT126 is an historic log structure constructed in approximately 1840 on land owned by Clinton A.
Rice. The building is intact (Fig. 2c) but seems to be
completely lacking in historic artifactual residues. The
site exhibits no unusual architectural features and has no
apparent relationship with any important historical figure.
Its intrinsic merit is based upon its age.
PREHISTORIC RESOURCES
Twenty prehistoric sites were recorded by the field
survey (Fig. 3). Five are outside the project boundaries;
three of these (41RT120 - RT122) were reported to the survey
crew by the landowner. The other two, 41RT108 and RT124,
are immediately adjacent to the project boundaries.
The characteristics of each site are presented in
tabular form as Table 1, and a descriptive account is provided
in Appendix I: Site Descriptions.
Surficial evidence of prehistoric occupation is characteristically a light scatter of lithic debris and burned
rock. Chert debitage is relatively scarce, a function of
distance from sources of lithic raw material. The areal
extent of exposed cultural material is generally small -only one site, 41RT113, exceeds 150 m. in its largest dimension. Six sites were found by shovel testing in promising
locations where no cultural material was apparent in quantity
on the surface.
Only two time-diagnostic artifacts were recovered,
precluding chronological placement of the majority of the
aboriginal occupations. The Perdiz type arrow point found at
41RT119 indicates at least a Late Prehistoric component at
this site. This general time period is also tentatively
represented at 41RT120 by the recovery of an untyped arrow
point fragment and a Perdiz point in a private collection.
Similarly, the ceramic fragments reportedly collected from
41RT124 by the landowner are characteristic of the Late Prehistoric Period. The unclassified dart point found at 41RT124
is of Archaic age.
Despite the liMited artifact assemblage noted at all
of the identified sites, some general patterns of site occurrence are evident. All 20 sites are proximate to permanent
water supplies; eight sites are associated with active springs.
Topographically, site locations are equally divided
between secondary terraces and upland slopes. Nine sites are
situated on secondary terraces; four of these are near active

11

springs. The nine upland sites are all contained in sandy
knolls; four are associated with springs. The one site found
tn the floodplain, 41RT108, is on a sandy knoll. One site,
41RT106, is situated on an interbasin slope between two tributaries of Gnats Creek.
All the identified sites are disturbed by historic
modifications and natural processes. As is evidenced by the
excavations at 41RT10 and RTll, the noncohesive nature of the
thin, sandy soils in this area is detrimental to the preservation of archeological materials in their depositional context.
Mixing is promoted by extensive rodent burrowing and root
growth. Modern land-use practices, especially extensive
clearing, plowing and grazing, have seriously affected the
archeological deposits and have accelerated erosion and deflation.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In general, the Twin Oak area is not ideal for the
preservation of archeological material and context. The sandy
loam upland soils tend to be unconsolidated, making them quite
susceptible to disruption by the clearing, plowing and construction which have modified a large part of Robertson County
during the past century. The destruction and displacement of
plant root systems and of the surface soil, and the pressure
of vehicular traffic, all combine to destroy the primary context of archeological remains on or near the present ground
surface. In addition, much of the area which has been long in
cultivation has suffered from severe deflation, which has
compressed and mixed cultural strata.
The sandy soils are also a favorite environment of
burrowing rodents, whose tunnels may mask or disrupt archeological features as well as providing pathways for the horizontal
and vertical movement of artifacts within the soil matrix.
Prewitt and Grombacher (1974: 4) point out that the pocket
gopher, ubiquitous in this area, will collect and cache obstructions, such as artifacts, which are encountered in their subterranean wanderings.
Another characteristic of the soils in the project
area is that they are generally acidic, providing a consistently
poor environment for the preservation of organic remains such
as bone and shell.
Sites which may have resisted these disruptive forces
gain increased significance for the interpretation of the
prehistoric occupation of the area. Because the retention
of structural integrity is so rare in this upland environment,
the potential for archeological recovery must be explored.
Seven of the fifteen prehistoric sites located within the
project boundaries are too disturbed to warrant further investigation. Eight sites, less severely disrupted, are recommended for subsurface testing to determine the nature, extent

Comments

The depth of sandy sediments at this site exceeds 60 cm. Although
surficially disturbed, undisrupted depositional sequences may be
retained at depth.
Cultural material, exposed by shovel probes, is a minumum of 40 ems.
deep although not surficially evident. These buried deposits may be
relatively intact.
This site has been exposed by plowing. The location is highly
favorable for prehistoric occupation. The depth and extent of this
site should be further tested.
This site is the largest located during the course of the survey.
The sandy sediments are at least 1 m. deep; archeological deposits
below the plow zone may have resisted major disruption.
Cultural material exposed at this site exceeds that of all others
recorded during this survey in both quantity and variety. The
wooded section of the site holds promise for intact deposits.
The proximity of this site to RTl 13 and RT114 permits economic
testing to evaluate the relationship between them. Sandy sediments
here are at least 1 m. deep.
A portion of this site is densely wooded. Deposits in that portion
of the site may remain intact.
Dense woods still stand on the southwestern ~'erimeter of the exposed
cultural material. It is very possible that archeological deposits have
remained undisturbed beneath this wooded area.

The recommended testing is an evaluative procedure
to ascertain the subsurface potential for significant recovery
of archeological remains. One or two test pits at each site
should be adequate for this further assessment. It can be
expected that few, if any, of these eight sites will have
resisted the disruptive forces characteristic of the region.
This recommended minor testing program will economically
determine if excavations of the ~agnitude conducted at 41RT10
and RTll are justified and will provide information necessary
for assessment of these sites for possible nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.

SUBSURFACE SAMPLING OF 41RT10 AND 41RT11
Sites 41RT10 and RTll were recorded during the initial
reconnaissance of the proposed Twin Oak Reservoir area (Prewitt
and Grombacher 1974). 41RT10 was recommended for subsurface
sampling, 41RT11 for limited s.ubsurface sampling. This
sampling program was conducted by Duford W. Skelton, H. G.
Wooldridge and James R. Pliska in June of 1979.

tributary draws which.enter Duck .. Creek from the southwest
(Fig. 1). A fenceline bisects the site. The southeastern
section is wooded; bulldozer ~learing of the northwestern
portion has resulted in sever~.erosion.· This site was recommended for subsurface sampling because the wooded part of
the site is composed of sandy soil with no record of having
been cleared or cultivated •. It was hoped that these deposits
would prove to be intact, undisturbed by recent ~odifications.
Excavation

Techni~ues

A northwest oriented cartesian grid was established
on the site, and a topographic map of the area was made.
Vertical control was maintained using a nail driven into a
large post oak to represent an arbitrary elevatiop of 100 meters.
Seven 2x2-meter units were excavated in 20 cm. arbitrary
levels (Fig. 4). All fill was screened through ~-inch wire
mesh. Burned rock was weighed and discarded in the field.
All other cultural material was bagged and labeled with horizontal and vertical provenience and is housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at
Austin.
Excavation Units
Excavations were begun in the northern, cleared half
of the site (Fig. Sb). In the first two units (Nl08/Wl08,
Nl06/Wll2) basal clay was encountered at depths of less than
20 cm. below the surface. Unit 3 (N98/Wl02) was placed just
across the fence which bisects the site, on the crest of the
knoll in the wooded section of. the site. Here too the sandy
sediments were less than 20 cm. deep. Cultural materials were
present in all three units (Table 3) but were disturbed by
root and rodent action. A Perdiz or Cliffton type arrow point
was recovered in Unit l and a Dawson ·type dart point in Unit 3.
Analysis of the soil profiles in these excavation
units and in cuts made into the slope of the knoll indicates
that much of the A horizon had been removed during clearing
and by subsequent erosion.

l7

The remaining four units were placed downslope in
the wooded section of the site in an attempt to recover less
disturbed deposits (Fig. 5c).
Units 4 (N79/W97.75) and 5 (N77/W97.75) are contiguous
2x2-meter units which were excavated to a depth of 120 cm. in
20 cm. increments. Cultural material was recovered in all
levels of Unit 4 (Table 3) but increased with depth until
Level 6 (100-120 cm. b.s.) where basal clay was encountered.
Two adjacent circular stained areas 15 cm. deep were uncovered
approximately 80 cm. below the surface and designated as
Feature 1. An oval charcoal stain, 8 by 18 cm., abuts a
circle of red burned sand 16 by 21 cm. at a recognition elevation of 99.32 m. A stacked cluster of petrified wood was
exposed in the south wall of Unit 4 in the same level.
Unit 5 was opened to better evaluate this second
feature. Cultural material was recovered in quantities comparable with Unit 4. Feature 2, when completely exposed, was
a roughly semicircular cluster of silicious wood fragments
approximately 43 by 32 cm. in horizontal e~tent and 26 cm.
deep (Fig. 5c). The· largest individual pieces were approxir.1ately
12 cm. in their maximum dimension; some were loosely stacked.
No pit outlines were evident. Artifact density decreased in
Level 6; basal clay was encountered at 107 cm. b.s.
Although cultural material was present in all levels
of both these units, the highest frequencies were noted in
Levels 4 and 5 (60-100 cm. b.s.) in association with the two
features. Time-diagnostic artifacts recovered from these units
a re:
Unit 4: Level 2 - one Alba and one possible Youngtype arrow points; Level 4 - one Dawson-type dart point;
Level 5 - one Darl (mahometJ, one possible Ellis and one
possible Fairland dart points.
Unit 5: Level 2 -·one Cliffton- or Scallorn-type
arrow point; Level 5 - one Godley, one prcbable Young and
one unclassified dart point.
Unit 6 (N65/Wll0) was placed south and west of these
contiguous units (Fig. 2). This 2x2-meter unit was excavated
to a depth of 80 cm. in 20 cm. increments. Levels 1 and 2
produced moderate to light densities of flint debitage and
scattered fire-cracked rock. The frequency of cultural
material increased with depth. Level 3 (40-60 cm.) contained
one proximal fragment of ~ thick biface, possibly a Morrilltype dart point base, and Level 4 (60-80 cm.) one complete
Yarbrough-type dart point and two dart point bases, both of
which are classifiable as Yarbrough variants. The majority
of the cultural material in this unit is lying on, or just
above, the sandy clay C hotizon, probably as a result of

downward movement through the weakly developed A and B horizons.
The excavation of Unit 7 (N67/W92) in the densely
wooded southern section produced little material in the first
four levels (0-80 cm.). The increased recovery in Level 5
continued through Level 7 (120-140 cm.) and then tapered off.
One classifiable dart point, a Neches River oletha-type, was
found in Level 5, and one scriber/scraper tool in Level 6.
Levels 8 and 9 were reduced to lx2 meters. A soil stain,
approximately 21 by 25 cm. in area and 3 cm. deep, was noted
in Level 9, 171 cm. b.s. This darker discoloration of the
yellowish sandy matrix, designated Feature 3, appears in
cross-section to be a small basin pit. A small cluster of
flakes, silicious wood fragments and hematite concretions
were found adjacent to the pit.
Summary and Conclusions
Much of this site lies within the densely wooded area
and has remained undisturbed by clearing and plowing. The
northern section, however, has been totally destroyed by
clearing, plowing and subsequent erosion and deflation.
Deposits in this area are contained within the remaining
10 to 15 cm. of sandy sediments.
In the wooded sections, as shown by the excavation of
Unit 7 to 190 cm., these sandy sediments are considerably
deeper and retain some structural integrity. Maximum artifact
densities occur approximately 20 cm. above the basal clay,
and cultural residues continue as far down as the basal clay
surface. However, the co-occurrence of diverse time-diagnostic
projectile points in several levels indicates that considerable
mixing of cultural residues has occurred in this portion of
the site. This may be in part attributable to the removal of
fill in 20 cm. arbitrary increments, but the overall increase
in burned rock and other cultural materials with depth is
real as well as apparent. Mixing is partly the result of
bioturbation by roots and rodents, especially the ubiquitous
pocket gopher, which move materials up and down in the profile,
as well as laterally. Artifact transportation is further
facilitated by the nature of the soil.
The soil matrix is composed of unconsolidated sandy
loam, with a gradual increase in clay content with depth
(see Appendix II: Soils Descriptions). These sandy sediments
rest upon a fairly impermeable basal clay. Cultural material
has apparently been moving gradually downward through the
profile. It is to be expected that this downward trend would
slow at greater depths, as the matrix becomes more cohesive
with increased clay content, resulting in a concentration of
cultural material above the basal clay.

24

Despite the m1x1ng and disruption evident throughout
the site, some genera1 stratigraphic integrity is demonstrated
by the recovery of arrow-type projecti1e points at higher
e1evations than the chronologica1ly earlier dart points. The
three cultura1 features documented, two of which are at
equivalent e1evations, are re1atively intact.
Time-diagnostic artifacts recovered from this sampling
include Perdiz, CZifftrn, Alba and Young type arrow points and
Yarbrough, Dawson, DarZ and GodZey type dart points, suggesting
that the site has been at least intermittently occupied from
the Midd1e Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods (ca.
4000-1000 B.P.). The three features recorded are stratigraphical1y associated with dart points characteristic of the Late
Archaic.
In addition to these projectile points, the variety of
chipped stone implements are those utilized in a generalized
hunting and gathering subsistence; no specialized activities
can be ascribed to this occupation area.
The excavations at 41RT10 are considered to have obtained
a representative sample of the cultural materials and features
at this site. No further work is recommended.
41RTl1
Site 41RT11 is located on the left (east) bank of Duck
Creek, on the inside of a large meander, approximate1y 500 m.
north and west of RTlO (Fig. 1). Burned rock and flint were
observed over an area 50 by 120 m. on a low rise in the floodplain of Duck Creek. At the time of the original survey, the
area had been recently bulldozed. This site was recommended
for limited sampling of the subsurface deposits (Prewitt and
Grombacher 1974).
Excavation Techniques
Horizontal control was established using a cartesian
grid oriented north and west. A nail driven into the only
tree left on the knoll was designated as an arbitrary elevation
of 100 m.
Six 2x2-meter units were excavated in 20 cm. increments
(Fig. 6). All fill was screened through ~-inch mesh. Burned
rock was weighed and discarded in the field. Al1 other
cultural material was bagged and labeled with provenience
information and is housed at the Texas Archeo1ogical Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.
Excavation Units
The first two units were placed slightly off the crest
of the kn o 11 ( Fi g . 7 a , b ) • The f i rs t uni t ( N11 0 / l/l 0 6 ) was
excavated to basal clay which was exposed at 36 cm. b.s. The

25

scant cultural material in this unit included one Perdiztype arrow point found in Level 1.
In Unit 2 (Nl28/Wll0) the small amount of cultural
material was contained in the upper 15 cm. of disturbed sandy
sediments. Basal clay was encountered at 7 to 15 cm. No
time-diagnostic artifacts or features were found in this unit.
Unit 3 (Nl44/Wll0), excavated 10 meters from the
creek cutbank, produced more cultural materi~l than any other
unit excavated at 41RT11, possibly the result of secondary
deposition caused by downslope movement. The sandy sediments
here extended to a depth of 60 cm.; artifact density increased
with depth. Three chipped stone tools were recovered just
above the basal clay -- one bifacially and one unifacially
flaked tool and one Ellis-type dart point.
Unit 4 (Nl46/Wl37), a 2x2-meter unit, was excavated
to a depth of 60 cm. at the intersection of the floodplain
and the base of the knoll. The first level was so disturbed
that only the north half of the fill was screened. The second
level was reduced to lx2 meters. No cultural material was
recovered.
A profile was cut into the north face of the channel
of Duck Creek between Units 3 and 4. The stratigraphic
sequence showed flood stages as alternating micro-bands of
silt, sand and organic-stained loamy sediments; cultural
material was not present in this profile.
Due to the paucity of cultural debris, only the eastern
half of Unit 5 (N73/W98) was screened. Excavation of this
unit was terminated at 100 cm. b.s. because of low artifact
recovery.
Unit 6 (Nll6/Wl08) was placed near the crest of the
knoll where occupational debris seemed more concentrated.
The 40 cm. excavated produced only a few flakes and burned
rocks.
Summary and Conclusions
Cultural deposits at 41RT11 are sparse, and limited
to the crest of the knoll on which this site lies. None were
found in the floodplain deposits below the knoll. The
deposits are generally less than 40 cm. deep and are contained
within the sandy A and B horizons. The basal clay zone is
sterile.
All units excavated were highly disturbed. The initial
bulldozer clearing of the site, subsequent erosion and deflation, and rodent burrowing have effectively obscured the
archeological context of the cultural remains. The two timediagnostic artifacts recovered, a Perdiz-type arrow point and
an Ellis-type dart point, represent a time span from the
Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric Period (see Table 4).

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
41RT106

A light chipped stone scatter is exposed on a deflated,
gravelly surface on the east side of an unnamed tributary
approximately 750 m. north of its confluence with Gnats Creek.
The site is situated on the lower valley margin of the interfluvial divide of two tributaries of Gnats Creek and overlooking
a wide floodplain. The site area has been cleared of all
vegetation except sparse, scattered grasses and trees along
the creek and fencelines. Just below the site, the floodplain
vegetation is dense grass.
Site Area: 25 x 25 meters
Cultural Material: one prismatic flake scraper, one
core, flint flakes and silicious wood.
Remarks: The site is badly eroded; basal clay is
exposed on the surface. No further work is recommended.
41RT107

Limited quantities of flint flakes, fire-cracked hematite, and silicious wood are exposed in rodent disturbances and
erosional rills on a sandy knoll overlooking the floodplain of
Walnut Creek. Just north of the site, an active spring drains
into Walnut Creek through a large erosional cut. At the
southern edge of the site, dense stands of trees border another
large erosional rill. Various grasses and weeds cover most of
the site area.
Site Area: 50 x 50 meters
Cultural Material: flint flakes, fire-cracked hematite
and silicious wood.
Remarks: Shovel 'testing exposed cultural material to
a depth of 30 cm. The sandy sediments extend to at least 60 cm.
More extensive testing is recommended to determine the potential
for recovery of significant cultural remains.
41RT108

Cultural materials are exposed in a rodent burrow atop
a small sandy knoll which rises approximately 1.5 meters above
the flat clay floodplain deposits on the east bank of Walnut
Creek about 900 meters north (upstream) of the confluence of
Walnut and Gnats Creeks. The site area is currently utilized
as pasture; vegetation consists of grasses and scattered overstory growth on the adjacent floodplain. Dense riparian vegetation is restricted to the stream margins. Rodent disturbance
is evident.

45

Site Area: 85 m. N-S, 50 m. E-W
Cultural Material: flint flakes, fire-cracked hematite
Remarks: This site is immediately outside the study
area. Shovel tests indicate that cultural material extends to
a minimum depth of 3D cm. The sandy sediments could be up to
two meters deep. Further testing is recommended if the area is
threatened by project-related modifications.
41RT109
Fire-cracked rock and one flint flake were exposed by
a shovel test on a sandy knoll overlooking the floodplain from
the east bank of Walnut Creek. This knoll is located on the
upland divide between Walnut and Gnats Creeks and is bordered
by a tree-lined fence on the northwest, a dirt road on the
northeast, and a barn and stockpens on the southeast. A seep
spring is located approximately 50 m. southwest of the site.
Dominant vegetation is Bermuda grass.
Site Area: 50 m. N-S, 75 m. E-W
Cultural Material: fire-cracked rock, one flint flake
Remarks: Shovel testing indicates that cultural
materials extend to a minimum depth of 40 cm. Additional
testing is recommended to determine the depth and integrity
of cultural deposits.
41RT110
Cultural materials are exposed on the surface of a
sandy rise of an upland bluff overlooking the floodplain of
Walnut Creek. The site area has been cleared and plowed in
the past, and is currently used as pasture. Vegetation consists
of various grasses and woody vines. Post oak and cedar comprise
the overstory growth along Walnut Creek and along an erosional
cut southwest of the site. A ranch road runs through the northern
section and the remains of a farmhouse and auxiliary buildings
stand downslope, southwest of the site. Rodent burrows are
prevalent.
Site Area: 90 m. tl-S, 65 m. E-1~
Cultural Materials: fire-cracked rock, quartzite
hammerstone, quartzite fragments. Chert was conspicuously
absent at this site.
Remarks: Several shovel tests were placed in various
areas of the site; no cultural material was recovered. Due
to the disturbed condition of this site, the result of historic
modifications, no further work is recommended.

46

41RT111

Cultural materials are exposed in a plowed field along
the bluff overlooking the floodplain from the east side of
Walnut Creek. Northwest of the site, a densely wooded gully
has been cut by an active spring. Just below the site and
to the west, another erosional channel has been formed by a
presently active spring. A heavily wooded area, a remnant of
the climax Post Oak Savannah, stands just north of the site.
Site Area: 50 x 50 m.
Cultural Material: fire-cracked rock and flint debris
Remarks: One shovel test failed to produce cultural
i11aterial. However, given the proximity to the active springs
and the depth of the sandy sediments, buried cultural remains
could exist intact. Limited subsurface testing is recommended.
41RT112

Cultural materials are exposed on a deflated secondary
terrace surface on the west side of a south-flowing tributary
approximately 1.4 km. from its confluence with Gnats Creek.
The site area has been cleared and plowed in the past and is
currently used as pasture. Trees are restricted to stream
margins; the dominant vegetation is grasses and weeds. Several
large erosional rills along the stream laterals appear to be
of recent origin.
S i t e A re a :
7 5 m• N- S , 4 O -rn • E- vi
Cultural Material: quartzite hammerstone, scraper,
one chert flake, fire-cracked hematite and modified silicious
wood
Remarks: Deflation, sheetwash erosion and extensive
rilling, as well as other disturbances resulting from historic
modification, have caused extensive damage to this site. It
is doubtful that intact c~ltural deposits remain. No further
work is recommended.
41RT113

Cultural debris is exposed on the recently plowed surface of a wedge-shaped, sloping secondary terrace bounded on
the east, west and south by Gnats Creek and two tributaries.
A small knoll in the center of the site also displays evidence
of prehistoric occupation. The terrace has been cleared; a few
trees remain along the streams and in the vicinity of an historic structure. Riparian vegetation characterizes the lower
section of the site in the floodplain of Gnats Creek.
Site Area: 300 m. N-S, 150 m. E-W
Cultural Material: chert debitage, quartzite, silicious
wood and fire-cracked hematite.
Remarks: The sandy sediments extend at least one meter
below the surface. Intact deposits may exist below the plow
zone. Subsurface testing is recommended.
47

41RT114
Cultural material is exposed on the recently plowed
surface of a moderately sloping secondary terrace on the east
side of Gnats Creek approximately 400 m. west (downstream)
of 41RT113. The site area is bordered on the south and west
by dense woods.
Site Area: 80 m. N-S, 120 m. E-W
Cultural Material: one flint gouge, one scribe,
scrapers, chert flakes, hammerstones and fire-cracked hematite.
Remarks: The cultural material exposed at this site
includes more modified flakes and larger specimens than were
recovered at any other site during the survey. The sandy
sediments extend to an undetermined depth. The cultural
deposits in the wooded portion of the site may remain intact.
Subsurface testing is recommended.
41RT115
A small scatter of interior flakes and fire-cracked
hematite lies on the cleared and plowed surface of a sloping
secondary terrace along the western side of a small tributary
100 m. north of its confluence with Gnats Creek. This site is
across the stream from 41RT113 and approximately 250 m. east
of RT114. The only vegetation in this area is restricted to
the stream margins. Sandy sediments extend to a depth of one
meter above dense red clay.
Site Area: 60 rn. N-S, 40 m. E-W
Cultural Material: flint and quartzite flakes,
quartzite fragments, fire-cracked hematite
Remarks: The proximity of this site to RT113 and
RT114 would permit economical sampling of all three sites to
assess the rel~tionship .between them. Lirnited subsurface
testing is recommended.
41RT116
Cultural material is exposed on the recently plowed
surface of a gently east-slaping valley margin just below and
east of a sandy knoll which is the divide between Gnats Creek
and a tributary. A large erosional rill just beyond the northeastern limit of the site exposes the subsurface soil unit.
Sixty to 80 cm. of sandy sediments overlie a reddish sandy clay.
A smaller erosional rill near the center of the site contains
flakes, quartzite and fire-cracked hematite. Dense stands of
oak, remnants of the climax Post Oak Savannah, mark the western
edge of the flake scatter.
Site Area: 160 m. N-S, 100 m. E-W

48

Cultural Material: modified and unmodified interior
flakes, secondary flakes, quartzite hammerstone and firecracked hematite.
Remarks: The possibility that cultural deposits remain
undisturbed by historic modification in the densely wooded
portion of the site should be examined. Subsurface testing
is recommended.
41RT117
Flint flakes, fire-cracked hematite and quartzite
cobbles are exposed along the deflated edge of a secondary
terrace overlooking the narrow floodplain of a tributary of
Gnats Creek. Numerous erosional rills and deflation have exposed
sandy and sandy clay soils. The dominant vegetation is various
grasses and weeds with scattered trees; dense stands of oak
and other trees remain along the stream channel.
Site Area: 15 m. N-S, 25 m. E-W
Cultural Material: flint flakes, quartzite cobbles
(two hammerstones), fire-cracked hematite and silicious wood.
Remarks: All cultural material is scattered along the
deflated, rilled margin of the terrace. No further work is
recommended.
41RT118
A few pieces of fire-cracked hematite and a single
flint flake are exposed in a plowed portion of a sandy knoll
situated between upland tributaries of Gnats Creek. A fence
bisects the site, dividing the southern plowed section from an
old field covered with grasses and weeds. Dense woods still
stand near the southwestern perimeter of the site. Sandy
sediments extend to an undetermined depth.
Site Area: 50 x 50 m.
Cultural Material: fjre-cracked hematite, one flint
flake.
Remarks: The possibility that intact cultural deposits
still exist within the wooded section of the site should be
tested. Limited subsurface testing is recommended.
41RT119
Cultural material is exposed in a cultivated area of
a sandy knoll si·tuated approximately midway between the upland
headwaters of Herds and Olivers branches. The site area has
been cleared and most recently used as a vegetable garden.
Scattered stands of oak remain along fencelines and an old

49

ranch road. Flakes and cores have been collected by the
landowner.
Site Area: 50 x 50 m.
Cultural Material: one Perdiz-type arrow point,
flint flakes, cores and hammerstones.
Remarks: This site yielded one of two time-diagnostic
artifacts recovered during the course of this survey -- the
Perdiz-type arrow point is indicative of a Late Prehistoric
(1,250 B.P. to European contact) occupation. However, historic
modifications have resulted in severe disturbance to the site.
No further work is recommended.
41RT120
This site, reported by the landowner, is situated on
the secondary terrace on the south side of Herds Branch and
overlooking a prominent spring.
Site Area: Estimated 100 x 70 m.
Cultural Material: flint flakes, arrow point fragment;
Perdiz point in private collection.
Remarks: This site is outside the present project
limits. This area should be avoided by project-related
modifications.
41RT121
This site, reported by the landowner, is situated
approximately 100 m. northeast of 41RT120 on the secondary
terrace on the south side of Herds Branch and overlooking the
same prominent spring.
Site Area: Estimated 75 x 50 m.
Cultural Material: interior flakes and fire-cracked
hematite.
Remarks: 41RT121 is outside the limits of the present
project. It should be avoided by rroject-related modifications.
41RT122
This site, reported by the landowner, is situated on
a large sandy knoll approximately midway between the upland
headwaters of Herds and Olivers branches.
Site Area: Estimated 80 x 75 m.
Cultural Material: lithic debitage and fire-cracked
hematite; small ceramic fragments in private collection reported.
Remarks: This site is outside the present project
limits. No further work is recommended unless the site area
is threatened by project-related modifications.

41RT123

Cultural materials are exposed in erosional rills
and heavily deflated areas along the northwestern slope of
an upland knoll overlooking the southern floodplain of Gnats
Creek. The site area is just below the upland divide separating Gnats and Becks creeks. The dominant vegetation is
Bermuda grass; dense stands of oak, hackberry, cottonwood
and pecan remain on the lower terraces of Gnats Creek.
Site Area: 60 m. N-S, 80 m. E-W
Cultural Material: flint flakes, quartzite cobbles,
fire-cracked hematite.
Remarks: The entire knoll has been bulldozed and
plowed, resulting in extensive deflation and erosion. No
further work is recommended.
41RT124

Cultural material is exposed along erosional rills
and heavily deflated areas of a secondary terrace on the east
side of Beck Creek overlooking the northern floodplain. The
site area is cut by a wooded drainway with several feeder
erosional rills. The terrace has been cleared and is currently
in old field vegetation of various grasses and weeds. Scattered
oak and other trees still stand along the stream channel and
gully; areas north and south of the site are densely wooded.
Shovel testing revealed that the sandy sediments are approximately 40 cm. deep over dense red clay.
Site Area: 80 m. N-S, 40 m. E-W
Cultural Material: one dart point (unclassified), one
quartzite hammerstone, quartzite cobble and fire-cracked
hematite.
Remarks: Historic modifications have resulted in
erosion, displacement and deflation of this site. Although
the dart point found at the site indicates an Archaic affiliation, shovel tests revealed no buried cultural material. No
further work is recommended. ·
41RT125

Shovel testing exposed cultural material on a secondary
terrace just below a prominent bluff line that parallels the
east side of Walnut Creek. The area has been cleared and the
dominant vegetation is Bermuda grass. Dense stands of trees
remain along a large erosional rill generated by an active
spring which flows southeast of the site.
Site Area: estimated 100 x 100 rn.
Cultural Material: flint flakes and fire-cracked
hematite.
Remarks: No cultural material is exposed on the surface, in the cutbank or in the erosional features. Shovel

tests encountered artifacts 15 cm. below the surface, extending
to a minimum depth of 80 cm. This site is immediately adjacent
to the present survey area; subsurface testing is recommended
if the area cannot be avoided by project-related modifications.
41RT126
This site is an historic log structure approximately
14 feet square, constructed with hand-hewn logs and square
nails. No scatter of cultural material was observed.
Historic research indicates that this building was
constructed by the Rice family in approximately 1840, on land
owned by Clinton A. Rice. A relative, W. S. Rice, probably
built and occupied this squatter cabin (Jack Jackson, personal
communication).
The structure is unusual neither in architectural
style nor in any relationship with important historic figures.
Its intrinsic merit is based upon its age.
Cultural Material: none was noted except the building
itself.
Remarks: This structure should be listed on the Log
Cabin Registry at North Texas State University. It is recommended that the building be avoided by project construction
and modification if at all possible. Failing that, the
structure might be transported to another lccation.
ISOLATED FINDS
Isolated finds consist of single artifacts or limited
cultural material exposure in localities where shovel testing
failed to produce any additional evidence of prehistoric
occupation. The locations of the nine isolated finds recorded
during the survey are shown in Figure 3.
!Fl - three s~all interior flint flakes were found in
an old field just across a small tributary from 41RT106
IF2 - one small interior flake and one bone fragment
were found in an erosional rill in a watermelon patch
IF3 - one secondary and one interior flake were found
on a weed and grass-covered deflated upland knoll
IF4 - one small interior flake was exposed in an old
field of grasses and weeds
IFS - one interior flake and unmodified quartzite were
located on a deflated and eroded gravel surface

52

IF6 - one interior flake with one modified edge was
found along a fenceline in a Bermuda grass field
IF7 - one large interior flake with modification of
one lateral edge was exposed in a road cut through a wooded
area
IF8 - one small interior flake was exposed in an
eroded road cut in a wooded area
IF9 - one secondary flake and one dart point fragment
were found in an eroded section of an old ranch road

Soils Description:

41RT10 and 41RT11

The soil attributes at 41RT10 and RTll indicate a
similar development. Both soils are of the Inceptisol order
and are members of the suhgrour Fluvaquentic Eutrochrepts
(U.S.D.A. Soil Taxonomy 1975). These soils exhibit characteristics of the Nahatche-Thenas soil series association,
with the Thenas fine sandy loam being the typifying pedon at
both sites.
The soils at both sites are forming from Holocene
alluvium along the Duck Creek drainage, where the sites are
subject to occasional overflow. However, the lack of flood
frequencies in the unit profiles indicates that the sites
receive very little fresh sediment. As a result of forming
in loamy alluvium sediments, both soils are moderately welldrained and are only saturated when Duck Creek is at flood
stage.
41RT10
The thickness of this solum ranged from less than 30
cm. in the deflated cleared area to over 130 cm. in the
undisturbed wooded section. The A horizon is a dark yellow
brown (lOYR 4/4) fine sandy loam and extends to approximately
40 cm. below the surface. The B horizon has a matrix of dark
yellow brown (lOYR 4/4) to yellow brown (lOYR 5/4) fine sandy
loam. This B horizon is only faintly distinguishable from the
overlying A horizon, an indication of the weak development of
this soil solum. The B horizon extends from approximately 40
to 90 cm. below the surface.
The C horizon is encountered approximately 90 cm.
below the surface. This horizon ranges from a reddish yellow
sandy clay mottled with light gray at about 90 to 110 cm.
to a mottled gray clay (lOYR 6/1) at 130 cm. below the surface.
The soils at 41RT10 are weakly granular and subangular
blocky in structure. All the horizons are slightly acid, and
the separation between th~m appears as a gradual, wavy boundary.
41RT11
The soil pedon characteristics at this site are similar to those at 41RT10. The solum thickness ranged from 40 cm.
in the higher portions of the site to over 150 cm. in the
floodplain of Duck Creek. The A horizon is a dark yellow brown
(lOYR 4/4) fine sandy loam which extends to approximately 17
cm. below the surface. The B horizon has a matrix of light
yellow brown (lOYR 6/4) which extends from the wavy lower
boundary of the A horizon to approximately 37 cm. below the
surface. At that point the yellowish red sandy clay (bYR 5/8)
of the C horizon is encountered.
The structural characteristics of this soil are the
same as those described for 41RT10, weakly granular grading
into subangular blocky structure. All horizons are slightly
acid.

Frequently, a prehistoric site located along a major
drainage is in an excellent archeological situation because
the deposition of sediments from overbank flooding provides
both protection and stratigraphic seraration. Due to their
topographic position, sites 41RT10 and 41RT11 are only occasionally subject to overflow, and the 'excellent' preservation does not occur. The relatively loose nature of the
solum has aggravated the cultural mixing caused by extremely
active bioturbation and other post-depositional processes.
