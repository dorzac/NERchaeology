I. INTRODUCTION
In February 2008, PBS&J conducted a cultural resource survey for the Leander Independent School
District in west central Travis County, Texas, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4799. The project area
is proposed for future construction of Leander Independent School District Steiner Ranch Elementary
School Number 3. The purpose of the investigation was to locate, describe, document, and assess all
existing cultural resources that would be affected by the proposed project. The investigation included a
site records search, a review of historic maps and aerial photographs, and an intensive survey of the
approximately 22.6-acre (9.1-hectares) area (Figure 1). The project area is located south-southeast of the
intersection of Quinlan Park Road and Dance River Pass in Steiner Ranch, Travis County, Texas. The work
was conducted by PBS&J archaeologist Michael Nash, who also served as principal investigator and
author of this report of investigation.
This study was performed in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas
Natural Resources Code of 1977) and other appropriate cultural resources legislation and guidelines, as
well as the guidelines set forth by the Register of Professional Archaeologists and the Council of Texas
Archeologists.

II. PROJECT SETTING
Topographically, the project area is situated along the summit and southeastern upper slope of a
northeast-southwest trending ridge bounded by the Colorado River (see Figure 1). The head of an
unnamed ephemeral tributary of the Colorado River is located at the southeastern corner of the project
area. Elevation ranges from a high of about 810 feet above mean sea level (msl) at the northern periphery
of the project area and slopes downward to the west and southwest to approximately 7,000 feet msl as it
approaches the head of the aforementioned drainage.
According to the Travis County soil survey, the project area is situated predominately on Brackett rock
outcrop complex soils, 1 to 12 percent slopes (Werchan et al. 1974). The Brackett series soils consist of
very shallow to shallow, well drained and moderately permeable, upland soil overlying limestone of the
Glen Rose Formation (Fisher 1974).
The project area is located within the Edwards Plateau vegetational region of Texas, as described by
Hatch et al. (1990). The Edwards Plateau vegetational region, also known as the Texas Hill Country, is a
highly dissected plateau characterized by a predominant oak-juniper woodland/shrubland interspersed
with pastures dominated by scattered trees and short to mid-grasses and forbs (Hatch et al. 1990).
McMahan et al. (1984) identify the project area and adjacent lands as Live Oak â Ashe Juniper Parks and
Live Oak-Mesquite-Ashe Juniper Parks. Observations made during the cultural resources survey of the
project area generally agree with these characterizations.

The plant community of the project area consisted primarily of undeveloped rangeland with natural
vegetation. The project area is located on a narrow ridge that supports patchy woodlands dominated by
plateau live oak (Quercus virginiana var. fusiformis) and Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), or pecan (Carya
illinoinensis). Other common tree and shrub species include Texas red oak (Quercus buckleyi), Texas
persimmon (Diospyros texana), elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens), Texas kidneywood (Eysenhardtia
texana), flame-leaf sumac (Rhus lanceolata), and pricklypear (Opuntia lindheimeri). Interspersed within
the woodlands are open areas dominated by various native and nonnative grasses and forbs. Dominant
grasses include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium var. scoparium), side-oats grama (Bouteloua
curtipendula), common curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri var. belangeri), and threeawn (Aristida sp.).

III. METHODOLOGY
Prior to field investigation, PBS&J conducted a records search at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory and the Texas Historical Commission on January 16, 2008. The records search identified
previous cultural resource investigations and/or previously recorded cultural resource sites within 1 mile
of the project area. This search results included all recorded cultural resource sites, as well as any sites
listed on or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designated as
State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). Historic maps available at the Texas State Library dating to
1901, 1936, 1946, 1973, and 1986 were reviewed (Texas State Highway Department 1936, 1946; United
States Geological Survey [USGS] 1901, 1973, 1986). A review of aerial photograph files of the Natural
Resources Conservation Service yielded photographs of the area dating to 1951, 1964, 1970, 1980, 1988,
1995, and 2005 (Agricultural Stabilization Conservation Service [ASCS] 1951, 1964; Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) 1970, 1980, 1988; USGS 1995; National Agriculture Imagery Program
[NAIP] 2005).
A PBS&J archaeologist conducted an intensive 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project area utilizing
parallel pedestrian transects spaced approximately 30 m apart. In accordance with the scope of work, no
shovel tests were excavated in areas with high ground surface visibility and low potential for buried
deposits due to limestone outcrops and very shallow soils overlying limestone bedrock (see Figure 1).
One shovel test was placed judgmentally within a small portion of the project area where surface visibility
was limited. It was excavated in 10-centimeter levels to a depth when clearly sterile substrates were
encountered. The soil was screened through Â¼-inch hardware cloth, and sediment color and texture were
recorded. No artifacts were collected.

IV. RESULTS
An examination of files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratories revealed no previously
recorded sites within the project area. Review of both historic maps and aerial photographs also suggests
no historic occupations have occurred within the project area. However, 13 previously recorded cultural
resources have been identified within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the project area, including sites

41TV1138, 41TV1180, 41TV1181, 41TV1185, 41TV1186, 41TV1222, 41TV1223, 41TV1231,
41TV1945, 41TV1946, 41TV1947, 41TV1948, and 41TV1949.
Site 41TV1138, 41TV1180, 41TV1181, 41TV1185, 41TV1186, 41TV1222, 41TV1223, and 41TV1231
was recorded by Espey, Huston and Associates in 1985 and 1986 associated with three separate land
development projects. Sites 41TV1946, 41TV1947, 41TV1948, and 41TV1949 were recorded by SWCA
in 2001 for a land development project. Two of the sites, 41TV1138 and 41TV1231, are historic sites
with extant structures dating to the late nineteenth century. The remaining 11 sites are prehistoric in
nature, all consisting of surface manifestations representing lithic procurement loci or ephemeral
campsites. The closest sites to the project area are sites 41TV1222 and 41TV1223, located southwest of
the project area about 500 m and 225 m, respectively. None of the sites will be impacted by the present
project.
A review of historic maps and historic aerial photographs did not locate any information indicating
possible historic resources within or in close proximity to the project area. The earliest representation of
the project area is a 30-minute topographic map published in 1901 but based on surveying conducted in
1895 and 1896. The map shows a road that appears to coincide with the present Quinlan Park Road
passing immediately northwest of the project area. Three residences and a ferry location are shown along
the road near the Colorado River more than 1 km south of the project area. The 1936 and 1946 Travis
County Highway maps show the road as a bladed earthen road with no other cultural activity in the
project area vicinity. A 1951 aerial photograph shows the project area exhibiting apparent native
vegetation. In aerial photographs dating to 1964, 1970, 1980, 1988, 1995, and 2005, and topographic
maps dating to 1973 and 1986, the project area shows a caliche gravel pit on the summit north of the
project area, which extends into the northern portion of the project area. By the 1995 aerial photograph,
Quinlan Park Road had been paved, and the 2005 aerial photograph shows a residential neighbor
northwest of the project area across Quinlan Park Road (ASCS 1951, 1964; NAIP 2005; TxDOT 1970,
1980, 1988; USGS 1901, 1973, 1986, 1995).
The cultural resources survey was conducted in February 2008 by PBS&J archaeologist Michael Nash.
The project area was generally open with surface visibility ranging from 20 to 100 percent, averaging
about 70 percent. Because of the excellent surface visibility and lack of potential for subsurface cultural
resources associated with the upland residual soils of the project area, only one shovel test was conducted
in an isolated area of low surface visibility.
No cultural resources were located in the pedestrian surface inspection or in the single shovel test. The
potential for significant unlocated cultural resources present within the project area is considered minimal.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The survey failed to locate any cultural resource sites. The lack of prehistoric sites can probably be
attributed to the lack of a reliable source of surface water nearby and the paucity of lithic raw material
resources in the project area.
With regard to historic resources, although the area was readily accessible to historic activities from at
least the 1890s, a map and aerial review shows no historic activity in the area except for caliche mining.
The lack of relatively level terrain may have served as a barrier to development.
As no cultural resources were located that are eligible or potentially eligible for listing on the NRHP or
for designation as a SAL, no further investigation is recommended in association with the proposed
project, and cultural resources clearance is recommended.
