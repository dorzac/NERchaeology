ABSTRACT

During the month of June, 1982, the Texas Archeological Survey, The
University
Texas at Austin, initiated and completed a program of
survey in an electrie utility transmission corridor in Fayette, Austin
and Washington counties, Texas. The program was sponsored by the Lower
Colorado River Authority and was designed to provide a detailed inventory
and evaluation of all euZtural resources within the corridor, including
an estimates of the impacts of',-bhe corridor development and recommending
measures for lessening any adverse effects on the identified resourees.
The survey was completed by walkover and inspection of the entire 25 miles
of the corridor. The survey fOund two prehistoric li thic seatter sites
and two isolated finds of probable prehistoric chipped stone tools.
The first site, 41AU53, is an unstratified scatter of lithic debris
and tools on a stream terrace remnant between two stream channels. The
site lacked diagnostic artifacts. The second prehistoric site, 41FY213,
consists of a few lithic ftakes scattered across a terrace edge and an
adjoining stream ftoodplain. This site also lacked diagnostic artifacts
and showed less cultural material than 41AU53. After consideration of
construction zones it was determined that only 41AU53 would receive any
impact from the proposed development and that this impact, from right-of­
way clearance, would be slight.
These sites are insignificant and lack any National Register potential.
Accordingly, Texas Archeological Survey recommends that development of
the Fayette to Salem transmission corridor proceed without avoidance or
monitoring of sites 41AU53 and 41FY213. However, subsurface probes should
be dug in the creek terraces of Clear Creek and Cummins Creek as these
areas are high site probability zones and subsurface probes may detect
buried stratified sites there.

INTRODUCTION

Texas Archeological Survey (TAS), The University of
Texas at Austin, has conducted a cultural resource survey
along the route of the Fayette to Salem transmission line,
across portions of Fayette, Austin and Washington counties
in southeast Texas.

This investigation was requested by

the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA), to inventory and
evaluate archeological sites to be affected by continued
development of the corridor.

Authorization was granted under

Permit No. 252, issued to the LCRA by the Texas Antiquities
Committee.
The field survey by TAS staff members David G. Robinson
and Leland C. Bement was begun on June 21, and completed on
June 28, 1982.

All phases of the work were overseen by the

Principal Investigator, David S. Dibble.
The specific aims of the survey and assessment were to
provide the sponsor with:
1)

a detailed inventory and evaluation of the scientific
or historic significance of cultural resources within
the corridor;

2)

an estimate of the impact of the project on such
resources; and

3)

recommendations for lessening any adverse effects on
the identified resources.
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The LCRA Fayette to Salem transmission corridor stretches
from the Cedar Creek Reservoir and Fayette Power plant in
Fayette County to the Fayetteville substation, about four
miles north of the town of Fayetteville, and thence across
the western corner of Austin County to the Salem substation,

two and one-quarter miles south of Brenham in Washington
County (Fig. I).

The total length of the surveyed corridor

is 25.0 miles; corridor width varies between 100 and 150 feet.
The total area surveyed was 406.78 acres.

The land

transected by the corridor varies in elevation between 250
feet and 450 feet AMSL and is drained by Jackson, Mill,
Williams and West Fork Mill creeks in the Brazos watershed,
and Jones, Haw, Clear, Camp, Spencer Pool and Cummins creeks
in the Colorado watershed.

The dominant land use today is

cattle ranching, although the transmission corridor crosses
corn fields and peach orchards as well.

Commercial gravel

pits are also found in eastern Fayette County.
The Fayette to Salem transmission corridor lies on a
substrate composed principally of the Tertiary Fleming and
Oakville formations of Miocene age, and the Quaternary Willis
Formation of Pleistocene age.

The Fleming Formation under­

lies the corridor in Washington and Austin counties and
extends into Fayette County to Cummins Creek, where it is
bounded by the Oakville Formation and some outcrops of the
willis Formation.

The Fleming Formation consists of a cal­

careous clay and medium to coarse grained sandstone, the
entire formation attains a thickness of about 1200 feet.
The Oakville is primarily a 200-500 foot formation of thickly
bedded medium grained sandstone with some calcareous clays
and silicified wood, quartz and chert pebbles.
mation consists of gravel, sand, silt and clay.

Willis For­
The gravels

are predominantly cobble-sized quartz and chert with minor
amounts of silicified wood.

The Willis Formation gravels

may correlate with the Uvalde gravels farther west, northwest,
and southwest.

The gravels have economic significance as

commercial grade gravels in Fayette County (Barnes 1974).
The area lies within the physiographic' Western Gulf Coastal
Plain Province (Fenneman 1938), and the transmission corridor
stretches across the divide between Colorado and Brazos River

4

drainages.

The topography consists of rolling slopes in

broad dissected stream drainages, and flat to rolling upland
prairies on the stream divides between the small tributaries
of the Colorado and Brazos.

The landscape is roughly divisible

into four topographic categories:

1) incised stream drainage­

ways; 2} lower slopes and stream terracesj 3) upper slopes;
and 4) nearly flat stream divides between the tributary
systems.

The surveyed corridor crosses at least four major

soils groups, primarily clayey loams and sandy loams charac­
teristic

upland slopes away from the lower terraces and

flood plains of the Colorado and Brazos.

Mapped associations

include:
1.

Crockett-Wilson association.

Nearly level to gently

sloping deep, slightly acid to mildly alkaline loamy soils.
2.

Heiden-Houston Black association.

Gently sloping to

rolling, deep moderately alkaline clayey soils.
3.

Heiden-Crockett association.

Gently sloping to rolling,

deep, moderately alkaline and slightly acid clayey and
loamy soils.
3.

Vernia association.

Undulating, deep, slightly acid

to mildly alkaline very gravelly sandy soils (USDA 1974).

graphy and soils of the area and region, see Brown and Kenmotsu
(1980), Kenmotsu (1981), Kenmotsu and Freeman (1980), Skelton
(1977), and Thornbury (1965).
The transmission corridor lies within the Texan Biotic
Province, a stable biotic division which extends from the
Texas Gulf Coast through central Oklahoma.

The province

consists of intergrading woodland and prarie associations
lying between the pine-hardwood forests of East Texas and oak­
cedar scrubland of the Balconian Province to the west (Blair
1950).

The principal forest dominants are post oak, blackjack

oak, liveoak and hickory.

Prairie grasses commonly include

little bluestem, Indian grass, switch grass, sideoats grama,

5

hairy grama, tall dropseed and silver bluestem.

The province

harbors 49 species of mammals, 39 varieties of snakes, and
18 of frogs and toads.
and red-tailed hawks.

Birds are numerous, especially vultures
Fish are abundant in the streams

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The cultural past of the survey area is divided into four
segments.

The earliest, the Paleoindian Stage, dates in

this region to before 9000 B.P.

Remains attributed to this

stage are scant and consist mostly of isolated finds of arti­
facts.

The Paleoindian was succeeded by the Archaic Stage,

a long period of time from about 9000 B.P. to 1250 B.P.

It

is to this long and broadly defined stage that most of the
prehistoric sites and finds in the area have been assigned.
The Archaic Stage was succeeded by the Late Prehistoric Period,
dated from 1250 B.P. to the time of historic contact, about
350 B.P.

The period is marked by the addition of the bow

and arrow and pottery to artifact assemblages, and changes
in cultural systems.

The fourth and last segment of the

cultural past is the Historic Period, from the first European
exploration and record keeping in the region to the present
day.

Detailed summaries and in-depth studies of the region's

prehistoric and historic occupations can be found in Brown
and Kenmotsu (1980: 4-6), Kelley (1955), Kenmotsu and Freeman
(1980: 10-11, 55-57), Skelton (1977: 13-16) and Weir (1976).
There are 213 recorded archeological sites in Fayette
County, 53 in Austin County, and 29 in Washington County (TARL
files).

Evidence suggests that the distribution of sites

across the landscape of these counties is patterned.

On one

recent survey where appropriate data were collected, 51% of
recorded sites,

(19 out of a total of 37) were found on the

6

fluviatile creek terraces and lower slopes, 32.5% on the
upper valley margins, 13.5% on the stream divides/uplands,
and 2.7% on creek flood plains and drainageways (Kenmotsu and
Freeman 1980: 17).

Survey of the Cedar Creek Reservoir for

the Fayette Power project (Jackson and Skelton 1975: 17-19)
identified 19 prehistoric sites in two broadly defined
physiographic divisions, uplands and alluvial terraces.

In

the uplands, which probably includes upper valley margins and
stream divides/uplands, three sites were found, constituting
15.8% of all prehistoric sites discovered on that large block
survey.
races.

Sixteen sites (84.2%) were found on alluvial ter­
Creek flood plains were apparently altogether lacking

in sites.

Upland and lowland sites were of several types
2
and ranged in size from 25m 2 to more than 4000m . Test exca­
vations and subsequent larger scale excavations (Skelton 1977)
showed the majority of sites with culturally diagnostic
artifacts to belong to the Archaic Stage.
These previous studies give preliminary evidence of a
settlement pattern focused on fluviatile terraces near year­
round water supplies, plant and animal food resources and
stream-transported lithic resources.

The increasing number

of archeological studies in Fayette and surrounding counties
is creating a body of data which will refine this picture of
the prehistoric settlement pattern and provide a basis for more
detailed studies of prehistoric cultural systems.

Both will

contribute to clearer and more definite cultural resource
management goals for the region.
FIELD METHODS
The f

ldwork was accomplished by walking the entire

transm1ssion corridor, with the exception of a 2.5 mile
segment north of the Fayette Power Plant which has been pre­
viously surveyed for cultural resources (Jackson and Skelton
1975).

Existing right-of-way and areas to be acquired were

7

examined by the personnel walking serpentine transects along
the corridor.

Small subsurface probes were made in high

potential areas on stream terraces and in areas of poor
surface visibility.

Sites were recorded fully on standard

site survey forms, sketched, photographed, and their locations
plotted on USGS 7.5' topographic quadrangles.

Ordinarily,

on these surveys, only diagnostic artifacts are collected.
None were observed during the survey and therefore none were
collected.

All notes, photographs and records are curated

at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University
of Texas at Austin.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The surveyors found two prehistoric sites and two pre­
historic items in isolated context in the Fayette to Salem
transmission corridor.

The sites are both small lithic

scatters located on high site probability stream terraces.
One isolated find is a large, thick chert biface found on a
small gravel outcrop of the Willis Formation.

There are no

associated cultural remains, with the possible exception of
an irregularly flaked chert nodule found several yards away.
The other isolated find is a brown chert tertiary flake dis­
covered east of Cummins creek.
found on stream terraces.

Both the isolated finds were

but the isolated finds will receive no further consideration.
41AU53
The site is a 700 m.

lithic scatter exposed on a terrace

remnant between the old channel and a current channel of an
intermittent stream tributary of West Fork Mill Creek (Fig. 2).
The terrace is composed of a fine sandy loam now covered with
grasses and a few scattered juniper trees.

8

The site is

2~

miles southeast of Latium, Texas, just south

of a dirt road, on the property of Samuel Mott.

Cultural

materials observed were two primary flakes, four secondary
flakes, a tertiary flake and a small, irregularly flaked
stone core.

All were of brown chert found locally in stream

beds and outcrops of the Willis Formation.

Flakes were found

on the slopes of the channel cuts on either side of the site
but appeared to be washing down from the terrace, not out of
the channel banks.

No stratification of the site was ap­

parent and the site is without diagnostics and datable
materials.
4lFY213
This is a 200 m.

2

lithic scatter located on the terrace

edge and slope above the flood plain on the southeast side
of Clear Creek (Fig. 2).

The site is on the current LCRA

Fayette to Salem right-of-way about three quarters of a mile
west-northwest of FM Road 1291 and the Fayetteville substation,
and 200 feet west-northwest of transmission tower 33.

Cultural

material found consisted of two tertiary flakes and one pri­
mary flake, all of the locally available brown chert.

4lFY2l3

also lacks diagnostics and is without subsurface depth.

The

terrace on which the site lies is composed of an extremely
dark grayish brown clayey soil, now supporting cultivated
pasture grasses.

The flood plain below the site supports a

lush riparian growth of trees, woody shrubs, vines and grasses.
Recommendations
4lAU53 lies in an area to be acquired for right-of-way
but where no tower construction is planned.

The site will,

however, be damaged by right-of-way clearing operations.

4lFY­

213 lies on the current transmission corridor right-of-way
and thus will not be disturbed by the presently planned con­
struction.

9

The sites recorded by the survey are not of National
Register significance.

Their value is their environmental

setting; they contribute to an emerging identification of pat­
terning in prehistoric settlement which emphasized activities
and site locations on stream terraces.

This value has been

preserved by the recording of the current survey.

without

stratification, which would preserve intact cultural features,
it cannot be argued that the likely surface modification to
be undergone by 4lAU53 would reduce its already minimal
scientific or cultural value.

It is therefore recommended

that the further development of the Fayette to Salem trans­
mission corridor proceed without avoidance or monitoring of
the sites 4lAU53 and 41FY213.

It is recommended, however,

that subsurface tests be made in extremely high probability
site zones on the creek terrace just north of Clear Creek,
about 4/5 mile northeast of the Fayetteville substation, after
the additional corridor acquisitions have been made.

Sub­

surface probes here, and on the flood plain terrace above
both banks of Cummins Creek to the northeast, will insure
minimal adverse impact to the cultural resources along and in
the vicinity of the Fayette to Salem transmission corridor.
