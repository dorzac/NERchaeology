ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the City of Hudson, Texas was performed by
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on November 20 and 21, 2015 under
Antiquities Permit 7471 issued by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). This
survey examined the site of the proposed wastewater treatment plant,
approximately 6.25 acres. The field methods included a 100% pedestrian survey
and shovel testing. No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was observed. It is
recommended that the City of Hudson be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. Copies of the report will be housed at the THC, Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), Texas State Library, City of Hudson, CME Testing
and Engineering, Inc, regional libraries, and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Hudson proposes new construction that will expand its existing
wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in central Angelina County (Figure 1). The
existing facility was constructed in 1978 and has reached its useful service life.
Most mechanical equipment has been replaced multiple times and the concrete
structures are deteriorating. This facility currently has problems with the removal
and handling of solid waste under the present loading conditions. The proposed
project will consist of two parallel trains, each with treatment capacity of 0.49
million gallons per day (MGD). The layout of the proposed units will include
reserved space for a future third train in parallel to achieve total capacity of 1.47
million gallons per day. The new treatment facility will be designed to serve a
population of 9800 persons. The proposed improvements will include one
1,000,000-gallon storm water equalization basin, new lift station with bar screen
and grit channels, two 0.49 MGD design flow oxidation ditches, 2 MGD peak flow
clarifiers, a new dual chamber chlorine contact basin and flow-proportional
chlorination system, a Parshall Flume with ultrasonic meter, and a 1.0 meter
sludge belt press. In addition, the existing contact basin will be converted to a
post aeration basin.
The project area is located adjacent to an unnamed street and consists of
two distinctive tracts. Tract A is approximately 2.06 acres in size and is located
within the fenced area of the existing WWTP. It has been cleared of all trees and
major shrubs and it is in this area where most of the proposed treatment units,
namely the new lift station, oxidation ditches, clarifiers, chlorine contact basin,
and the sludge belt press, will be constructed. Tract B is directly adjacent to
Tract A and is 4.19 acres in size and very thickly wooded. The proposed earthen
structure, known as the stormwater equalization basin, will be located in Tract B.
To the north, and adjacent to Tract B, is an existing treatment pond that will not
be affected by the proposed construction.
There are no cemeteries or standing structures in or near the Area of
Potential Effect (APE). Funding for this project will be provided by the State of
Texas through the Texas Water Development Board. Figure 2 depicts the project
area on the USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle Keltys (3194-231).

ENVIRONMENT
Angelina County is located in the central part of East Texas. It is about 48
miles in length from northwest to southeast and about 24 miles long from
northeast to southwest. The western-southwestern boundary is the Neches
River and the eastern-northeastern boundary is the Angelina River and Sam
Rayburn Reservoir. The rest of the county is bounded on the northwest by
Cherokee County and on the southeast by Jasper County. In 1988, the county
consisted of 514,465 acres of land and 38,974 acres of water. Additional
reservoirs built since that time would have changed this ratio. According to the
soil survey for Angelina County (Dolezel 1988:1), the county is located within the
East Texas Timberlands Land Resource Area. Dolezel (1988:1) writes that the
soils in the county “formed mainly under forest vegetation in a humid
environment” and that most soils are “light in color and low in natural fertility.”
The terrain varies from low, level areas to hills that rise and the variation in
altitude ranges from 100 feet in the south to about 460 feet in the north. The lowlying areas are often wet and the steeper landforms erode easily. The drainage
pattern in the northern and southern parts of the county, due to the presence of
the Angelina and Neches rivers, is dendrtitic with many large streams. In the
central part of the county, the drainage patterns are poorly defined. The nearest
source of water to the APE is Jack Creek less than 0.47 km to the west. The
January mean minimum temperature is 37° F and the July mean maximum
temperature is 93° F. Rainfall averages 38.9 inches annually (Alvarez
2004:140).
According to the General Soils Map in the soil survey for Angelina County
(Dolezel 1988), the majority of the APE is located within the Koury soil
association that consists of nearly level loams and clays underlain by clays and
loams on floodplains. The specific soil in the project area is Koury loam,
occasionally flooded (Ko). It is depicted in the soil survey on Sheet 15. In a
typical profile, this soil has a pale brown surface layer about 17 inches thick
(Dolezel 1988:44). At this depth, the B horizon is usually present (Dolezel
1988:96). Holocene alluvial fill may be present on the surface but the parent
material may belong to the Yegua Formation of the Eocene epoch (Dolezel
1988:118).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a statistical overview of prehistoric sites in Texas by Biesaart,
et al. (1985:Figure 15), Angelina County is located in the Northeast Texas
Cultural-geographical region of Texas, an area that encompasses 30 counties
(Figure 3). It is one of the counties in the extreme lower reaches of this region
and it borders Polk, Tyler, and Jasper counties in the Southeast Texas Culturalgeographical region. Because of the proximity of Angelina County to this
adjacent region, some cultural traits were probably shared between the
prehistoric inhabitants of both regions. The statistical overview cannot be viewed
as 100% accurate but it does provide a time frame for comparisons. For
example, the overview reports that 52 prehistoric sites in Angelina County had
been recorded at TARL in 1985. Unfortunately, the overview does not give site
numbers but it does list them by temporal period. According to the overview
nine sites were identified as Archaic and forty-one as Late Prehistoric. There is
an obvious mistake in the overview because the number of Archaic and Late
Prehistoric sites equals only fifty. No Paleoindian sites had been reported. Only
one site had been formally excavated while twenty-one sites are described as
having been tested by hand. Surprisingly, only three sites are listed as having
been disturbed by erosion and only two by construction. The major form of
disturbance was caused by vandals at twenty-one sites. One site was described
as destroyed. Information on the kinds of sites is also limited but the overview
does report that five burials had been documented. Five sites are listed as
“earthenworks” and it is likely that they are referring to earthen mounds. Today,
there are 220 prehistoric and historic sites in the county that have been recorded
at TARL. This increase is related to an increase in construction projects
associated with a growing population of the area.
In 1991, an evaluation was made of significant sites in the Northeast
Texas Archeological Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.1.1). At this
time, Angelina County contained 126 recorded prehistoric sites. Of this number,
19 were listed as not significant, 67 as unknown significance, 35 as probably
significant, and 5 as significant.
The archaeological significance of Angelina County is partially reflected in
the following statistics. According to Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:Figure 2.3.3),
the county contained the second highest number of important hunter-gatherer
sites in Northeast Texas (n=3) in 1993. It also contained at least 13 important
Late Caddoan sites (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.2). Unfortunately,
there are major forces that continue to threaten the integrity of archaeological
sites in Angelina County. These include population growth (City of Lufkin and
surrounding area), highway construction, surface lignite mining, Sam Rayburn
Reservoir (formerly McGee Bend), and the lumbering industry.

Although private contract archaeology firms have played a part, most of
the archaeological sites known to exist in Angelina County have been identified
by surveys associated with reservoir construction and in-house projects by
National Forest personnel. The earliest archaeological research in the area was
performed in the late 1930s and early 1940s by researchers from The University
of Texas at Austin. At that time, prehistoric cemeteries and mound sites were
considered to be of primary importance. From the late 1940s until the mid
1970s, most of the archaeological research in East Texas was carried out in
connection with reservoir construction. In 1948, Robert L. Stephenson (1948a,
1948b) published the results of his work at the proposed McGee Bend Reservoir
in Angelina, Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San Augustine counties. At the
time, this was the only major archaeological investigation in the county performed
by a professional archaeologist in a systematic manner.
In the 1970s, Ross Fields (1979) presented an overview of the cultural
resources of the Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, Angelina, and Sabine National
Forests of Texas. This document provides a brief discussion of all sites in each
forest and 23 sites in Angelina County are mentioned. Another important
document for this area is a cultural resource overview of the National Forests in
Texas by John Ippolito (1983).
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Angelina County, especially when numerous contract reports are
available. The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et
al. 1985), the planning document published by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993), and Perttula’s (2004) Prehistory of Texas.
Gus E. Arnold was an employee of The University of Texas at Austin in
the 1930s and 1940s. During this time, he travelled about the state documenting
prehistoric sites. In 1939, he reported a large site in Angelina County that
contained several mounds on three acres of land adjacent to Jack Creek. He
described it as a village and burial site. Three of the mounds were measured at
2.5 to 3 feet in height and 60 to 75 feet in diameter. Some had already been
disturbed by collectors. Numerous artifacts are known to have been collected at
this site with pottery being the most common. The owner of the site at the time
found a skeleton, gun, and trade beads while plowing. W. Hayden Whitsett
visited the area in 1976 and was unable to locate the site, now known as
41AG22. On the site form, Whitsett writes that the site “is not at either location
shown on the maps at TARL. One natural feature resembling a mound was
found, but no cultural remains were present. The western uplands and east and
west bottoms were checked.” This site is especially relevant to the current
project because it is on the opposite side of Jack Creek from the area that was
investigated for the City of Hudson by BVRA.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the presence of previously recorded
sites and other archaeological surveys in the project area and vicinity. Relevant
archaeological reports documenting work in Angelina County were reviewed in
order to become familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic sites found in the
area. BVRA has conducted eight projects in Angelina County and these reports
were also reviewed. The survey began on November 20, 2015 and was concluded
the next day. The field methods included a 100% surface inspection and shovel
testing. Shovel test data were entered onto a shovel test log (Appendix I) and
digital photography was used to capture the various areas and features of the
project area. Shovel test data were dug in the APE. They were plotted on a sketch
map and later onto an aerial photograph (Figure 4). The daily activities were written
in a field notebook. The total area surveyed was approximately 6.25 acres and
16 shovel tests were dug.
The project area was divided by a dirt/gravel two-track road (Figure 5).
The western portion is referred to as the “Plant Area – Area A” and the eastern
portion is referred to as the “Forested Area – Area B.” The B horizon is
supposed to be present at about 43 centimeters below the ground surface.
Therfore, all shovel tests were dug to depths of 51 to 71 cm to ensure that the B
horizon was encountered. The soil consists of silt from the surface to the
maximum depth of the shovel tests dug in this area. According to the soil survey
for Angelina County (Dolezel 1988), the Koury series is loam and the B horizon is
silty loam. Sixteen shovel tests were dug in the two areas.
Area A
Area A is approximately 2.06 acres in size and had been cleared of all
major vegetation prior to this survey. At the time of this investigation, the
vegetation consisted of recently mowed Johnson grass (Figure 6), which made it
difficult to see the ground surface.
Areas of disturbance or alteration to the landscape consisted of a pile of
dirt at the western end that had been brought there to serve as a backstop for the
firing range for local police. Other forms of disturbance included a manhole and
probable pipeline north of the pile of dirt. Low areas in the southern portion of
the area have been filled with dirt in order to elevate the buildings and other utility
areas in the plant area.

Shovel test 9-16 were dug in this area and they varied in depth from 60 to
71 cm. Soil diversity was greater here than in the forested area. The soil from
Shovel test 9 is a pale brown silty loam (the color is the description for the Kourys
series) that extends at least 60 cm below the ground surface. The brown soil
matrices found in the forested area are present but they are shallow in nature in
the western portion where they overlie the pale gray silty loam. Since they are
closer to the creek, the different colors may be due to differential sedimentation
during flooding.

Figure 6. Johnson Grass in Area A
Area B
Area B is approximately 4.19 acres in size and was thickly wooded at the
time of this survey. The only cleared areas were the narrow lanes that had been
cleared for a topographical survey (Figure 7). The vegetation consisted of trees
and understory plants. The density of vegetation varied considerably. It was
much easier to see the ground within the cleared lanes but virtually impossible in
the wooded areas. Piles of trees were observed on the sides of the cleared
lanes and the majority was less than two inches in diameter, indicating recent
growth. Those trees identified included oaks, pines, elms, and hackberries.

10

Understory vegetation present was Johnson grass, berry vines, saw
greenbrier, grape vines, Spanish moss, and other miscellaneous perennial
species. The vegetation varied from areas that were virtually impenetrable to
other areas that were savannah-like. Entry to the forested area was easy since
the Hudson WSC had cleared four lanes within it. The terrain was gently
undulating and several small drainages were present. In the central portion,
standing water not more than one inch deep was abundant from recent rains. No
shovel tests were excavated within the cleared lanes. Only those areas above
the standing water and not saturated were tested. Shovel tests 1-8 were
excavated in Area B and water was encountered about 60 centimeters below the
ground surface on average. The depth of the tests varied from 51 cm to 69 cm.
The procedure for digging and recording shovel test data was the same as that
emploed in Area A.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
sites had been previously recorded within the boundaries of the current project area
and no portion had been examined by a professional archaeologist. The field
survey involved two days of surface inspection and shovel testing. No evidence of
a prehistoric or historic site was found. There are several probable reasons for the
absence of a prehistoric site. Although the western portion of the project area is
very close to a creek, the terrain is flat and subject to flooding. Gray silty loam was
in the upper 20 cm of some of the shovel tests and this may reflect the presence
of standing water over time. Prehistoric site 41AG22, complete with mounds and
burials, is reported on the Atlas to be directly across the creek from the APE.
Since this site is described on the site form and Atlas as a village site with
mounds, it is not unreasonable to expect cultural materials on the opposite side
of the creek somewhere within the current project area. However, a survey in
1976 by W. Hayden Whitsett failed to find any evidence of the mounds reported
in 1939 by Gus Arnold. Therefore, the probability of a significant prehistoric site
being in the project area is reduced from high to very low. Historic sites can
occur anywhere on the landscape but the potential of flooding probably was a
major factor in the absence of a homesite. The wooded portion of the project
area is even less likely for prehistoric utilization except for collecting forest
resources for food and shelter. This type of temporary activity is not likely to
leave evidence of its occurrence.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. Should evidence of a prehistoric or historic site be encountered during any
phase of construction in any of the areas investigated, all work must stop until the
THC can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the THC.
