ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the 10 x 500 foot proposed Sulphur Creek Bank
Stabilization Project was conducted by American Archaeology Group LLC in October 2008
and December 2009. This project was performed for the City of Lampasas. This
investigation was performed using the pedestrian survey method supported by backhoe
trenching. No archaeological sites were encountered, therefore it is recommended that
construction within the project area be allowed to proceed as planned. Monitoring during
construction was conducted by AAG to ensure that no buried cultural resources were present
within the project area. No artifacts were collected, therefore, no curation is necessary.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Lampasas, Texas, plans to construct a stabilization bank consisting of
gravels and rock material on the south side of Sulphur Creek, on the southeast side of the
City of Lampasas, Lampasas County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on
the 7.5’ U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle Lampasas dated 1954 (Figure 2). The
Universal Transverse Mercator (U.T.M.) coordinates for the approximate center of the
tract are Zone 14 Northing 3436418 and Easting 0578654.
The project area is located along the southeast side of Sulphur Creek (Figure 1)
approximately 500 feet by 10 feet. The nearest water source is Sulphur Creek which is
spring-fed and flows into the Lampasas River to the east. The topographic position of the
project area fluctuates from 1010 to 1000 feet in elevation above mean sea level.
Previous archaeological surveys in Lampasas County have identified significant
prehistoric and historic sites. Therefore, an archaeological survey was required by the
Texas Historical Commission, the lead review and compliance agency, before
construction of the park is allowed to proceed. In order to satisfy this requirement, the
City of Lampasas, Texas contracted with American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G) to
perform this service. The project was conducted under the auspices of Antiquities Permit
number 5056 and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act because of the
Section 404 permitting under the Clean Water Act.

ENVIROMENTAL SETTING
General
Lampasas County is included in the Balconian biotic province as described by Blair
(1950:112-116):
The Balconian province, as here defined, takes in most of the Edwards
Plateau as limited by Sellards, Adkins and Plummer (1933) the Lampasas
Cut Plain and the Comanche Plateau by Raisz (1946), and the Central
Mineral or Llano Uplift region. That part of the Edwards Plateau lying west
of the Pecos, and often referred to as the Stockton Plateau, is not included,
but is referred instead to as the Chihuahuan province.
Climate
The Balconian climate is characterized by a decrease in rainfall from east to west.
Coryell and Lampasas Counties are in the eastern half of the province, which has been
classified by Thornwaite (1948) as dry, sub humid, and mesothermal, with average annual
potential evapotranspiration of between 39.27 and 44.88 inches.
Vegetation
According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of this
province is a scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus asheii), Texas oak (Quercus texana),
stunted live oak (Quercus virginiana), and various less numerous species.
The project area is also located well within the Prairies Vegetation Region and the
Edwards Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962). Plant species characteristic of the region
include Plateau live oak (quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (quercus texana), ashe juniper
(juniperus ashei), honey mesquite (prosopis glandulosa), cedar elm (ulmus crassifolia),
cottonwood (populus deltoides), pecan (carya illinoinensis), elm (ulmus spp.), sumacs (rhus
spp.), Texas persimmon (diospyros texana), agarita (berberis trifoliolata), Texas stillingia
(stillingia texana), yucca (yucca spp.), Texas prickly pear (opuntia lindheimeri), yaupon
(ilex vomitoria), and American beautyberry (callicarpa americana). Grasslands include
seep mulhy (muhlenbergia reverchnoii), Canadian wildrye (elymus canadensis),
dichanthelium (dichanthelium spp.), Texas grama (bouteloua rigidiseta), and red grama
(bouteloua hirsuta).
Hydrology
The project area is within the Brazos River drainage basin. The Brazos is one of the
most extensive rivers in the state. The major drainage closest to the project area is Sulphur
Creek which flows into the Lampasas River, now a part of Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir.

2

Wildlife
The Balconian Biotic Province generally contains a mixture of fauna from several
surrounding provinces (Blair 1950). Typical species found within the project area include
white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (sylvilagus floridanus), ninebanded armadillo (dasypus novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (lepus californicus),
raccoon (prycon lotor), hispid cotton rat (sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (melagris
gallopavo), morning dove (zenaida macroura), scissor-tailed flycatcher (tyrannus
forficatus), northern bobwhite (colinus virginianus), western coachwhip (masticophis
flagellum testaceus), and the bullsnake (pituophis melanoleucus sayi).

Soils
There is one soil series located within the project area depicted on sheet 39 of the
Soil Survey of Lampasas County, Texas (Allison and Bynum 2001): (Oa)-Oakalla silty
clay loam, rarely flooded. This soil is very deep and in level areas along floodplains of
major streams. The soil generally consists of a surface layer of very dark grayish brown
silty clay 0-38 inches thick, then 38-58 inches below the surface is a brown silty clay
loam with an underlying yellowish brown silty clay loam from 58-80 inches.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Lampasas County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical
region as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central Texas by
most archaeologists and is rich archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Lampasas County and vicinity have
prepared by various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at the Fort Hood Military
Installation (Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al. 1981; Thomas 1978; Roemer et al. 1985;
Carlson et al. 1986), Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site
(Shafer1963), and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964, Sorrow et al. 1967).
Suhm (1960), Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981, 1985) have published summaries of the
region. Most recently, two thorough articles concerning Central Texas were published in
Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society. These works, entitled
“Forty Years of Archaeology in Central Texas,” by Michael B. Collins (1995) and
“Implications of Environmental Diversity in the central Texas Archaeological Region” by
Linda Wootan Ellis, G. Lain Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995), represent a major
synthesis of the vast amount of collected data for the region. The following discussion is
taken primarily from the works cited above.
Paleoindian Period
Although according to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the
term “Paleoindian,” it is so widely accepted that it is used in this discussion. Paleoindian
typically refers to those cultures that were oriented toward big game procurement
adaptation. Collins (1995:381) argues that subsistence in Clovis times, for example,
Paleoindian exploited a diverse fauna base that not only included large herbivores such as
mammoth, bison, and horse but also included smaller animals such as turtles, land
tortoises, alligators, mice badger, and raccoon. At Kincaid Rockshelter, paved floor
suggests that the inhabitants of this site returned to the same site as part of a regular
hunting and gathering strategy in contrast with nomadic hunters who only pursued big
game. It is, therefore, assumed that an array of plants presumably also constituted part of
Clovis subsistence (Collins 1990; Collins et al. 1989)
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood times periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because few sites have
been excavated. Evidence of this period often occurs in the form of surface collected
materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort hood, this period is represented by
distinctive projectile points found in multicomponent surface sites and as isolated finds
(Carlson et al. 1986:125). Generally, it is believed that this period lasted from about
10,000 B.C. until 6000 B.C. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include dart types
Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Golondrina, and Plainview as defined by Suhm and Jelks
(1962) and Turner and Hester (1985).

These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and may
be more distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan 1931).
Some rockshelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are
located a considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of a rockshelter in
Central Texas immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleoindian
occupation is the Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County (Redder 1985)
Archaic Period
The Archaic represents a board cultural time period that lasted from
approximately 8500 Before Present (B.P.) to 1250 B.P. in Central Texas. According to
Prewitt (1981:71), “The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas.”
Prewitt (1981) has subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. LeRoy Johnson (1987) has
questioned the validity of the phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the phases
occurring before the Middle Archaic. Carlson et al. (1986:15) has grouped these into
Early, Middle, Late and Terminal Periods.
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a “strong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population
was of low density.” This occurred during the Circleville, San Geronimo, and Jarrell
phases (8500 B.P.- 5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic, food gathering had become very
specialized as evidenced by the presence of numerous burned rock middens/mounds
(Prewitt 1981:78-80). The Middle Archaic is seen by Prewitt to have taken place during
Oakalla, Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000B.P. - 2600 B.P.). An
Overall decreases in burned rock middens took place during the Late Archaic. Bison
were important as a food resource, but did not dominate subsistence activities (Prewitt
1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600
B.P. - 1750 B.P.). The terminal Archaic, according to the classification by Carlson et al.
(1986), includes the Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750 B.P. -1250 B.P.). An
increase in the importance of gathering and an apparent peak in site density seems to have
occurred during Prewitt’s (1981:82) Driftwood phase.
Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been referred by some as the Neo-American Stage (Suhm et al.
1954) and the Post-Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994). Technological changes are the
primary distinguishing characteristic of this stage. The Austin (1250 B.P.- 650 B.P.) and
Toyah (650 B.P. - 200 B.P.) phases belong to this stage of prehistory. During this time
arrow points first appeared as well as ceramics and possibly horticulture.
According to Collins (1995:385), there is now evidence that the bow and arrow
appeared initially in Central Texas; pottery was added later, and agriculture developed
last and was of minor importance. Because Late Prehistoric groups continued to practice
hunting and gathering, a division or two sub-periods seem to have taken place. These are
referred to as early and late by Collins (1995:385) with the break between the long-

5

standing Archaic period and the Late Prehistoric period occurring at circa 800 B.P. when
Toyah replaced Austin as the prevailing archaeological information.
The most obvious changes that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period is the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear
thrower. Otherwise, subsistence life ways in the Late Prehistoric were probably little
different from those in the earlier Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A
chronological model by Dillehay (1974) of bison presence and absence periods on the
southern plains suggests that bison were present in Central Texas during the Toyah phase
but not during the preceding Austin phase.
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the historic period of Central Texas into three subperiods: early, middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and
European peoples and cultures were present; however, in the third the indigenous peoples
had virtually disappeared. The early historic sub-period in Central Texas began in the
late 17th century with the first documented arrival of Europeans. Lampasas County is
situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who inhabited the area in the
16th Century (Newcomb 1986). By the 19th century, they had broken ties with the
Comanche and Wichita and were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32).
They have been described as typical southern Plains Indians who were hunters and
gathers and who lived along the streams and rivers of Central Texas. Remains of this
group have not been found in an historic context in Lampasas County.
During this period, Texas was occupied by numerous aboriginal groups including
the Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986). Trade is
known to have existed between the Jumanos and the Coaddos. The Lipan Apaches and
subsequently the Comanches entered the region from the Plains while following key
animals resources as they migrated into Texas. Contact peered occupations are often
identified by the occurrences of glass beads, gun parts, gunflints, metal projectile points,
and European manufactured ceramics. The archival search did not locate any Historic
Indian sites in Lampasas County. In adjacent Coryell County. A blue glass bead was
found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group burial along the Leon River (Jackson
1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an isolated find on Horse Creek in the
extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952).
In February 1856, the Texas Legislature created the County of Lampasas out of
the Milam-Bell-Coryell County area to the east and the Bastrop-Travis County area to the
west. By March 10, the county was officially organized and its government was in
business (Elzner 1974:20-22).
In the early years of settlement of Lampasas County, incidents between Indians
and Anglo settlers were common. First permanent settler Moses Hughes reported “In

6

1857 the Indians became very troublesome, killing people and stealing horses and making
depredations until 1866 or 1867” (Elzner 1974:76).
Official U.S. Census records do not record a population for Lampasas County in
1850. In 1860, the population of Lampasas County was 1,028. It rose slightly during the
tumultuous Civil War and Reconstruction years to 1,344 by 1870. During Post-Bellum
industrialization and tenant farm transition, the population exploded to 5,421 in 1880, the
highest rate of increase over a 10-year period in Lampasas County. The population
continued to increase but at a slightly lower rate, being 7,584 in 1890, 8,625 in 1900, and
9,532 in 1910. From 1920 to 1980, the population levels declined, but they have risen
slightly during the past 18 years (The Dallas Morning News, Inc. 1993: 333).
The frontier moved westward, leaving in its wake a growing population and
farming area in western central Texas. Moses Hughes built the first mill on the north
bank of Sulphur Creek in the middle 1850’s. In 1873, John Casbeer, Sr. built a mill
which became Lampasas’ most active processing plant after the Donovan family assumed
ownership in 1876. This father-son team ran the mill at a greater output and
improvement until the early 1920’s. Two additional mills served the agricultural needs of
central and eastern Lampasas County before the turn of the 20th century. The Chadwick
mill served the processing needs of our project area from 1874 to 1915. The services of
cotton ginning, flour milling, and sawing lumber were provided at this mill (Elzner
1974:135-136).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
In the site files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin are
numerous pieces of correspondence from landowners and artifact collectors documenting
and describing sites and artifacts found in Lampasas County. Also present are copies of
unpublished manuscripts, some of which do not provide information concerning author
and date of preparation.
At the time of this survey there were no archaeological sites recorded in the
project area. Recent surveys by Espey, Huston & Associates (Jones et al. 1988) recorded
six prehistoric sites, primarily consisting of lithic scatters. Albert Field (1956:161-184)
reported on a number of important sites within the county. In 1985, a field trip report was
filed by Laura Studer regarding historic and possible prehistoric debris located south of
the current project where a federal housing project was being constructed. Subsequently,
site 41LM7 was recorded at that locality and appears to not extend into the current project
area.
Lampasas County contains numerous prehistoric and historic sites, many
potentially eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or as State Archaeological
Landmarks. However, certain sections of the county have not been adequately
investigated. The current project area falls within this category. There is reason to
believe that large number of unrecorded sites exist along the major streams of this area in
the form of surface sites, possible rockshelters sites, and buried sites.

FIELD METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, a background investigation was conducted. Site records
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas were checked
for previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, site reports
documenting work in the region were examined for information concerning
archaeological surveys and other work relevant to the project area. The project was
discussed with representatives of the City of Lampasas to ensure that the field crew was
aware of the correct boundaries of the proposed park project.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished using the pedestrian survey method supported by
backhoe trenching. Surface visibility was excellent over much of the project area. In
addition to surface inspection, five backhoe trenches were excavated (Figure 2). Matrix
samples from the backhoe trenching was screened using one-quarter inch hardware cloth.
A backhoe trenching log (Appendix I) documented the subsurface testing.

9

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
The site records at TARL revealed no sites had been recorded in the project area.
Large scale federal projects such as Belton Reservoir, Stillhouse Reservoir, and Fort
Hood have recorded the vast majority of sites in the region. Two USGS maps for the
Lampasas Quadrangle (1894 and 1954) were reviewed. No structures were depicted on
the 1894 map, a relatively small scale map (1/125,000).

Field Survey

The field survey did not identify any prehistoric or historic sites within the project
area. The bank stabilization project is being undertaken by the City of Lampasas and is
subject to federal permitting by the Corps of Engineers pursuant to Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act. The project involves the construction of a 350-500 foot concrete
retaining wall to prevent erosion of the south bank of Sulphur Creek. The intensive
archaeological survey includes pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching along
approximately 550 linear feet (152 meters) of the east bank of Sulphur Creek (Figures 1
and 2).
On October 15, 2008, AAG issued a letter based on reconnaissance of the
project area and revealed that a backhoe stationed on the rim of the creek bank would
not be able to reach to the creek bed. Based on this observation, AAG recommended
trenching down from the bank as far as possible prior to construction and archaeological
monitoring during construction. Construction will entail the use of a trackhoe to
excavate along the lower level of the creek bank. The trackhoe excavations will provide
AAG with the opportunity to sample buried deposits in this area.
On October 20, 2008 AAG conducted a pedestrian survey along the rim of the creek
bank and excavated five backhoe trenches (Figure 3). No cultural remains were
observed during the pedestrian survey, and only two of the five BHTs yielded cultural
remains (Figure 2). At BHT-4 a single tertiary flake of gray to dark gray chert was
recovered from screened backdirt. The flake exhibits slight retouch along a lateral
edge and was presumably utilized as spokeshave. At BHT-5 a large historic timber was
exposed by the backhoe. The timber may have formed part of a wooden bridge that
once spanned the creek near the project area. This artifact was photographed but not
collected.
On December 4, 2008, AAG submitted an interim report recommending that the
project be allowed to proceed and that monitoring during construction would take place.
The Texas Historical Commission concurred on January 20, 2009.

10

On December 31, 2009, AAG was present during the bank stabilization
construction to monitor for any potentially buried cultural resources. Figure 4 provides a
good view of the construction techniques and the good stratigraphic profile exposed for
inspection. Additionally, five columns were hand excavated in a 10 x 30 centimeter
column and the matrix was screened as an additional opportunity to identify potentially
buried cultural material. One black chert fragment was identified and one modern bottle
fragment.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The current survey of the proposed City of Lampasas Sulphur Creek bank
stabilization project performed for the City of Lampasas did not identify any prehistoric
or historic sites in the project area. American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that
construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible that buried cultural
materials can be missed during any Phase I survey. Therefore, should any sites be located
during the construction of this bank stabilization project, all work within the site should
cease until the situation can be evaluated by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission, in consultation with American Archaeology Group LLC and the City of
Lampasas.
