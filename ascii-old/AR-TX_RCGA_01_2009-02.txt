ABSTRACT

T

due to the denial of survey permission, and any
additional temporary work spaces or additional
above-ground facilities that extend outside of the
surveyed environmental corridor.
The total area surveyed for cultural resources was in the order of 2406 ha (5945 ac),
including approximately 211.8 km (131.6 mi) of
the proposed pipeline route, 39.8 km (24.7 mi)
of abandoned pipeline route alternatives and two
compressor station sites measuring 16.2 ha (40
ac) in combined area. A total of 5,618 shovel
tests were excavated during the Phase I cultural
resource survey and archeological inventory, and
41 new or previously recorded cultural resources
were assessed. They consisted of seven previously recorded archeological sites, 11 newly identified
archeological sites, 22 non-site isolated find spots,
and a single historic cemetery that has not been assigned an archeological site designation. Twentyseven of these cultural resources are situated within
the preferred Gulf Crossing environmental survey
corridor, while the remaining 14 now lie outside
of the project area due to design changes. A summary of the recommendations for the 41 identified
cultural resources is shown the following table.

his document presents the results of a
Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory conducted for the
proposed Gulf Crossing Project in Texas. The
project will entail the construction of approximately 568.4 km (353.2 mi) miles of a new 42inch natural gas pipeline within Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. From west to east, the counties crossed in Texas by the proposed undertaking
include Grayson, Fannin, Lamar, Delta, Hopkins,
Franklin, Titus, Morris, and Cass. Fieldwork for
this project consisted of pedestrian survey augmented by systematic shovel testing of most
landforms. Although Gulf Crossing only anticipates that a 30.5 m (100 ft) wide construction
right-of-way will be required, the Phase I cultural
resources survey examined an environmental
corridor that was 91.5 m (300 ft) to 106.7 m (350
ft) in width.
Additional geoarcheological, Phase I, and
possible Phase II, cultural resource investigations have been scheduled by Gulf Crossing for
the unexamined project items. These surveys will
include all private access roads that may require
upgrades, any remaining sections of the proposed
mainline corridor that have not been surveyed

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

S

ection 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended,
requires the lead federal agency with jurisdiction over a federal, federally-assisted, or federally-licensed undertaking to consider impacts
to historic properties before undertaking a project. A historic property is defined as any prehistoric or historic district, archeological site, building, structure, or object included in, or eligible
for, inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP). The implementing regulation of
Section 106, issued by the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (ACHP), is 36 CFR Part
800. The regulation establishes a process of identifying cultural resources that may be impacted
by the undertaking and evaluating the eligibility
of these properties for listing on the NRHP; assessing the effects of an undertaking on cultural
resources determined to be historic properties;
and consultation for methods to avoid, reduce, or
mitigate any adverse effects to NRHP-listed or
eligible properties. Adverse effects include, but
are not limited to, destruction or alteration of all
or part of a property; isolation from or alteration
of its surrounding environment; introduction of
visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that are
out of character with the property or that alter its
setting; transfer or sale of a federally owned property without adequate conditions or restrictions
regarding preservation, maintenance, or use; and
neglect of a property resulting in its deterioration
or destruction (36 CFR 800.5).
Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC, is
filing an application for a Certificate of Public
Convenience and Necessity with the lead federal
agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), for authorization to construct and
operate its Gulf Crossing Pipeline project. The
project is a proposal to construct a 42-inch outside diameter (O.D.) natural gas pipeline within
the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and

Mississippi (Figure 1.1). This Phase I cultural
resources survey and architectural inventory report is intended to provide relevant information
to the Texas Historical Commission / State Historic Preservation Office and the FERC and assist
those agencies in conducting their Section 106 review of the undertaking. All work was performed
in accordance with the procedures outlined in
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,
as amended; the Archaeological and Historic
Preservation Act of 1974; the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended; and
Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts
60-66 and 800, as appropriate. This survey effort
abided by the standards set forth in Archeology
and Historic Preservation: The Secretary of the
Interior’s Guidelines and the Texas Historical
Commission’s Preserving Our Heritage: a Statewide Plan for Texas guidelines. It also followed
guidelines established by the Council of Texas
Archeologists, the Antiquities Code of Texas,
and the Texas Historical Commission’s Rules of
Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code
of Texas.
This document presents the results of the
Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory conducted in Texas for the proposed
Gulf Crossing Project. The approximately 568.4
km (353.2 mi) long mainline portion of the proposed 42-inch O.D. natural gas pipeline is located
in multiple counties/parishes of Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. The project will consist of
approximately 341.7 km (212.3 mi) of new pipe
that is collocated with (i.e., adjacent to) existing
pipeline rights-of-way. The remaining 226.8 km
(140.9 mi) of the 42-inch O.D. pipeline will not
be collocated with an existing utility right-of-way
(i.e., will be greenfield corridor). The pipeline will
be located in the following counties/parishes: a)
Grayson, Fannin, Lamar, Delta, Hopkins, Franklin, Titus, Morris, and Cass Counties, Texas; b)

Bryan County, Oklahoma; and c) Caddo, Bossier,
Webster, Claiborne, Lincoln, Union, Ouachita,
Morehouse, Richland, and Madison Parishes,
Louisiana (Figure 1.1). In addition, a 17.8 mi
(28.6 km) long, 42-inch O.D. natural gas pipeline loop is planned for construction in portions
of Hinds, Copiah, and Simpson Counties, Mississippi.
The Gulf Crossing Project will commence
at a new interconnect with Sherman Express
Pipeline Partners, LLC at a point near Sherman,
Texas and proceed northeast to interconnect with
Enogex, Inc. near Bennington, Oklahoma. From
Bennington, the pipeline will proceed southeast to
an interconnect with Crosstex North Texas Pipeline, LP near Natural Gas Pipeline Company of
America’s (NGPL) Station 802 in Lamar County,
Texas. From this point, the pipeline will then continue southeast to an interconnect near Tallulah,
Louisiana (Figure 1.1) The project also will entail
the construction four compressor stations located
in Grayson and Paris Counties, Texas and Caddo
and Ouachita Parishes, Louisiana, as well as the
addition of compression units at a compressor
station in Simpson County, Mississippi. In addition, a total of seven meter and regulation stations
will be built within Grayson and Lamar Counties
(n=2), Texas, Bryan County (n=1), Oklahoma,
and four within Ouachita and Madison Parishes,
Louisiana. The Gulf Crossing Project will be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under Section 7(c) of the Natural
Gas Act (15 USC 717). As such, it is subject to
review under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (16 USC 470) (NHPA) and its’
implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).
This investigation was completed on behalf
of Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC by R.
Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc., between
January and June of 2007. This field effort was
designed to identify and to evaluate all cultural resources (archeological sites, isolated finds, historic
standing structures, historic cemeteries, and traditional cultural properties) situated within the Areas
of Potential Effects that may be impacted as a result
of this undertaking. The environmental survey corridor was either 91.5 m (300 ft; collocated) wide
or 106.7 m (350 ft; greenfield) wide for the entire

length of the project; this will accommodate any
additional temporary workspace needs or allow
for minor pipeline route adjustments without the
need for additional survey work. As part of this
current cultural resources investigation, a total of
approximately 211.8 km (131.6 mi; 95.6 percent)
of the proposed Gulf Crossing Project in Texas
and two compressor stations totaling 16.2 ha (40
ac) were surveyed for cultural resources. Approximately 39.8 km (24.7 mi) of additional survey
corridor, which was subsequently removed from
the project design, was also assessed for cultural
resources. Additional Phase I cultural resource investigations will be conducted for all remaining
unsurveyed portions of the Area of Potential Effects of the project. These surveys will include all
private access roads that may require upgrades,
the unsurveyed sections of the proposed mainline corridor, and any additional temporary work
spaces or additional above-ground facilities that
extend outside of the surveyed environmental
corridor. These additional surveys are anticipated to be completed by the end of 2007, with the
supplemental report sent to the Texas Historical
Commission and FERC by early 2008.
Project Background and Research Design
Construction of the proposed 42-inch O.D.
pipeline will require a 30.5 m (100 ft) wide construction right-of-way in uplands and a 22.9 m
(75 ft) wide construction right-of-way in wetlands. The construction right-of-way will be divided into a 18.3 m (60 ft) wide (10.7 m [35 ft]
wide in wetlands) working side and a 12.2 m (40
ft) wide spoil side. Following construction, a 18.3
m (60 ft) wide permanent easement will be retained. For the portion of the mainline paralleling
existing foreign and Gulf South pipelines, Gulf
Crossing’s new permanent right-of-way will abut
the adjacent existing right-of-way. The additional
12.2 m (40 ft) (4.6 m [15 ft] in wetlands) of temporary construction right-of-way will be located
on the opposite side from the existing pipeline
corridor.
The Phase I cultural resources survey and
archeological inventory of the proposed Gulf
Crossing Project was designed to identify, record,
and to assess all cultural resources located within

Chapter I: Introduction
the Area of Potential Effect associated with the
currently proposed undertaking. A multi-staged
approach was used to complete the investigation.
It consisted of cartographic, archival, and archeological review of data relevant to the project
area, as well as pedestrian survey and systematic
shovel testing along the accessible portions of the
proposed pipeline corridor. All cultural resources
identified during survey were examined to ascertain the nature, size, depth, integrity, age, and affiliation of the associated cultural deposits. The
investigation also included an assessment of all
standing structures 50 years in age or older that
were located within the limits of the proposed
pipeline corridor and the other examined project
items. The gathered information then was used to
assist in the subsequent assessment of a site as not
significant or as potentially significant applying
the National Register of Historic Places criteria for
evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]).

NATURAL SETTING

T

opography and Hydrology
Northeast Texas borders the mid-reaches
of the Red River, which extends from its
source in eastern New Mexico to its outlet at the
Mississippi River in Louisiana. Small tributary
streams within the basin flow in a northeasterly
direction to the main channel. Larger superimposed tributaries, such as the Sulphur River (including White Oak Creek) and Cypress Creek,
originate in the Blackland Prairie physiographic
region and flow east-southeast, joining the Red
River below the Great Bend. Much of the Gulf
Crossing Project corridor parallels the Sulphur
River basin, in a course that traverses exceedingly dissected upland terrain and broader, less
broken plateaus. These landforms are punctuated
by numerous minor watercourses and irrigation
canals.
From its entry into Cass County from Louisiana, the project corridor heads west-northwest
across upper Cypress Creek tributaries, then parallels the south side of White Oak Creek before
crossing it near its confluence with Ripley Creek.
The route crosses the Sulphur River approximately 10 km (6 mi) further on in Franklin County,
then veers directly northwest into Bryan County,
Oklahoma after crossing the Red River in Fannin
County. A small segment of the proposed pipeline
enters Grayson County from Oklahoma, after once
again crossing the Red River. The eastern half of
the corridor crosses heavily broken ridge-andravine landforms, but in general the terrain becomes less dissected west of the White Oak Creek
crossing. The land gradient on the Texas side of
both Red River crossings is relatively gentle, with
bluffs and terraces more pronounced of the north
side of the valley. Peak elevation in the project
area occurs in the vicinity of Brookston in Lamar
County at 183 m (600 ft) amsl, approximately 49
m (160 ft) above the Red River floodplain.

The larger Red River tributaries, such as the
Sulphur River and Cypress Creek, have welldeveloped meander patterns within relatively
wide floodplains. Landforms in these valley settings were clearly favored for human settlement
in the past, although basin size does not necessarily equate with a stable water supply (Thurmond 1990:16-17). Rather, groundwater supply
is excellent throughout much of northeast Texas
because of underlying sedimentary bedrock that
is conducive to the containment of aquifers. Discharge as springs occurs even in remote upland
areas, and documented spring-fed drainages are
numerous in the greater region; many archeological sites are found in close proximity to these
potable resources (Albert 1984; Ferring 2007:15;
Perttula 2004b:371; Thurmond 1990: Figure 4).
The Red River is a sinuous stream with a
wide and shallow channel that carries a large sediment load. Its banks are easily eroded, and the
low gradient contributes to a rapidly migrating
channel and multiple abandoned meander belts.
Landforms inclusive to each belt include natural
levees, crevasses (breaches in the levees), abandoned meander loops (or oxbow lakes) and point
bars. Backswamps form in low-lying areas of
floodbasins and may be occasionally flooded or
hold permanent water (Guccione 2004:65; Waters
1992:128-138). The valley floor in the project vicinity was reportedly subject to frequent flooding
prior to construction of the Lake Texoma reservoir (Albert 1984:43). Comparisons with General
Land Office maps from the mid to late nineteenth
century illustrate dramatic changes in the channel’s course over the past 150 years, both locally
and downriver (Albert 1984: Figure 16; Guccione
and Hays, forthcoming). These migrations have
affected (destroyed) any archeological resources
that were situated on now-eroded shores within
the floodplain and lower terraces.

Chapter II: Natural Setting
Geology and Soils
The project route spans the Blackland Prairie and Interior Coastal Plains physiographic
provinces as these units are defined in northeast
Texas (Ferring 2007:Figure 1). Counties in the
west portion of the corridor (Lamar, Fannin, and
Grayson) are within the Blackland Prairie unit,
and counties in the east portion (Cass, Titus,
Morris, Franklin, Hopkins, and Delta) are within
the Interior Coastal Plains unit. The division between these provinces largely reflects geology.
Upper Cretaceous chalks and marls (including
Marlbrook Marl, Gober Chalk, and Brownstone
Marl) comprise much of the bedrock in the western province, with the age of the formations being
increasingly greater toward the north. The oldest
Cretaceous complexes are situated at the two Red
River crossings and are represented by interbedded sandstones and shales of the Eagle Ford and
Woodbine formations. Later Tertiary rocks of the
Claiborne Group (Sparta Sand-Weches-Queen
City-Recklaw sequence) and the Midway Group
form the bedrock base in the eastern portion of
the corridor. These are composed of siltstones,
shales, sandstones, and coals laid down during
the lengthy regression of the ancient Gulf Coast
to its present position, which began nearly 60
million years ago. Near the project corridor, the
Upper Cretaceous / Tertiary contact occurs at the
confluence of Sulphur River and Brushy Creek in
Red River County (Barnes 1979, 1991). Distinct
vegetation zones broadly conform to the geological divide, with grassland communities dominant
in the drier west and the Pineywoods, characterized by oak-hickory-pine forest, occupying much
of the east. A belt of the Post Oak Savanna ecotone marks the transition between the two zones.
Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks are overlain
by Quaternary sediments of Pleistocene and Holocene age, which formed largely as floodplain
and terrace deposits of the ancient Red River
watershed (Barnes 1979, 1991; Huffman et al.
1978:41-44; Jacobs 1980). Remnants of five Quaternary terraces are identified in the northwest
portion of the project corridor as it approaches the
Red River in Lamar and Fannin Counties; those
mapped where the route re-enters Texas in Grayson County are undifferentiated (Barnes 1991).
The older, higher (T-2, T-3, T-4, and T-5) Pleis-

tocene terraces well predate human occupation of
the region, and thus cannot contain deeply buried
archeological sites, although they may occur on
their surfaces. Each of the upper terraces is composed of up to 9 m (30 ft) of interbedded gravel,
sand, silt, and clay. Sandy and silt loam soils commonly form on their surfaces and are considered
suitable to prehistoric farming technologies (Albert 1984:29). The Nebraskan (T-5) and Kansan
(T4) terraces have a patchy distribution in hilly,
dissected terrain, and tend to support grassland.
The Illinoian (T-3) and Wisconsinan (T-2) terraces cover larger expanses of rolling to level terrain
that lies parallel to the Red River channel, and are
currently rated excellent soils for growing cotton,
soybeans, and peanuts, and corn. The youngest
terrace (T-1) spans the Pleistocene-Holocene
transition, and its formation may have continued
until the Late Holocene, or approximately 2000
B.P.. This flat, poorly-drained terrace is adjacent
to the Red River, with a surface approximately
5 m (17 ft) above the floodplain. Undifferentiated Quaternary terraces are also mapped along
portions of smaller stream valleys in the project
corridor, including Bois D’Arc Creek in the Red
River basin, Sulphur River and White Oak Creek
in the Sulphur River basin, and Bee Creek and
Black Bayou in the Cypress Creek basin (Barnes
1979; Thurmond 1990:9).
Recent Holocene alluvium mantles the floodplains of the Red River and its tributaries. Studies
of deposits on the Red River valley floor indicate
that T-1 terraces representing less than 1000 years
of formation are up to 9 m (30 ft) thick and that
modern floodplain deposits are at least 5 m (16 ft)
thick (Frye and Leonard 1963). A high sedimentation rate on these recent landforms is corroborated by deep subsurface testing conducted in the
vicinity of the project area (Peter at al. 1991:6375). Poorly developed soils in these contexts
confirm the recent age, or perhaps conditions of
excessive saturation, of the deposits. In temporal
terms, T-1 and floodplain deposits hold the greatest potential for containing and preserving buried
archeological sites, yet the authors cited conclude
that any sites which may have evaded erosion are
likely too deeply buried for detection.
The Sulphur River and its tributary, White
Oak Creek, have produced alluvial belts in places

over 5 km (3 mi) wide. Unlike tested portions of
the Red River valley near the project area, the
lowest terraces have yielded a number of archeological sites (see Pullen et al. 1971; Trierweiler et
al 2002). Investigations of low-relief floodplain
surfaces are less promising. A series of middle
and late Holocene paleosols has been identified
in the Sulphur River floodplain, buried under
1.75 meters of recent alluvium; to date cultural
deposits have not been found in association with
these buried surfaces. Weakly developed soil profiles (A-C-2C horizons) characterize most of the
floodplain, and are indicative of recent age or the
effects of saturation, poor drainage, and erosion
caused by cultivation practices (Cliff and Hunt
1995:5-15). Significant for the present study, deep
testing was undertaken for the Southern Interconnect Pipeline at the same Sulphur River crossing
made by the currently proposed Gulf Crossing
Project pipeline. Five trenches laid perpendicular
to the north edge of the channel were excavated
to a depth of 5 m (16 ft); these resulted in the
recovery of deposits typically associated with
active floodplains, and lacked evidence of paleosols or cultural deposits (Peter, Hunt, and Cliff
1989). Deep testing complemented by resistivity
survey within the White Oak Creek Mitigation
Area yielded similar results, and the investigator concludes that while the floodplain, “has the
potential for buried, sealed stratified sites, these
sites may be few in number, difficult to find, and
buried to a considerable depth” (Cliff and Peter
1992:132). Finally, the sporadic presence of gravel lag deposits is noted in uplands of the region,
probable remnants of the Tertiary Rocky Mountain outwash known as the Ogallala Formation
(Banks 1990:56-57; Huffman et al. 1978:44).
Properties of soils contribute to an understanding of the parameters of site formation and
discovery in the project area. The Blackland Prairie physiographic province is characterized by
deep, clay-rich soils formed from fine-grained
Cretaceous marine sediments. The dominant
soil series is Houston Black Clay, which exhibits continual structural deformation caused by
the shrinkage and swelling of clay. Clay movement induces deep vertical cracking and the upward rotation of any cultural deposits that may
be contained within it, resulting in contextual dis-

turbance. Microfeatures consisting of ridges may
be recognized on the surface, and are known as
gilgai (Waters 1992:299). Dense clay soils were
certainly an impediment to prehistoric cultivation
technologies, and were probably avoided by ancient farmers (Cliff and Hunt 1995:9). Wetland,
or hydric, soil types are commonly associated
with floodplains throughout northeastern Texas.
These soils form under conditions of persistent
flooding, saturation, or ponding, long enough to
develop anaerobic features and inhibit the occupation of surfaces. Such soils are unstable and
usually show weak profile development (Federal
Register 1994, 2002; USDA 2006). Both hydric
and clay soils susceptible to gilgai movement are
of low potential for the creation or preservation of
archeological sites. Apart from floodplains, sandy
soils predominate throughout much of the Pineywoods and adjacent Post Oak Savanna, and are
hospitable to prolonged occupation and prehistoric farming methods, provided they are not excessively drained (Perttula and Nathan 1989:3841; Thurmond 1990:13). Sandy loam and loam
soils are prevalent in valley margin terraces of
the Sulphur and Cypress Creek basins where they
formed on ancient coastal sediments and within
the massive deposits of Quaternary alluvium that
blanket the Red River valley. Most prehistoric
sites in the White Oak Creek drainage are associated with sandy loam or loam soils found in elevated valley edge or slope settings well removed
from the marshy floodplain floor (Cliff 1994:200;
Cliff and Peter 1992:120). Land use over the past
century and a half has significantly impacted
the disposition of soils and vegetation (Peter at
al. 1991:4, 55). In particular, land clearance for
farming in upland areas, and the construction of
levees, stock ponds, irrigation features, and quarries along the Red River and its tributaries, has
resulted in erosion and destabilization of numerous surfaces in the region.
Lithic Resources
Local outcrops suitable for stone tool manufacture are not abundant in the Interior Coastal
Plains province. A heavy reliance on ancient alluvial gravel deposits for lithic sources is therefore
indicated in the region (Banks 1990:49, 55-57).
One exception is ferruginous, or ironized, sand8

Chapter II: Natural Setting
stone that occurs in the Dexter Member of the
Woodbine Formation (undifferentiated in Texas,
but well defined on the north side of the Red River [Huffman et al. 1978]). This rock resembles
hematite and was sometimes used by prehistoric
people to make large chopping tools.
Concretions of hematite or limonite reportedly co-occur with the ferruginous sandstone,
and these minerals are known to have been used
as pigments (Banks 1990:56). Huffman et al.
(1978:37) identify “tiny pellets of siderite or limonite” on surfaces of the Rainbow Clay that
forms the upper layer of the Dexter Member.
Both the Dexter and Lewisville formations yield
plentiful sandstone suitable for ground stone tool
production, as do the later, Tertiary, Reklaw and
Sparta formations of the Claiborne group. Also
notable are mineral pigments that were found in
Late Prehistoric Caddoan graves; these derive
from the Weches formation of the same Claiborne
group. Small quantities of petrified wood were
obtained in rocks of the Wilcox group (Thurmond
1990:12-13).
In contrast, alluvial deposits such as those
in Pleistocene terraces and gravel bars within
the Red River and Sulphur River basins contain
large clasts of knappable stone (Albert 1984:2223; Cliff and Hunt 1995:8). Frisco and Woodford
cherts, sourced to the Arbuckle Mountains and
possibly transported as outwash via the Washita
River, are among the materials identified in these
deposits (Albert 1984:73-74; Banks 1984:84-86).
The presence of Tertiary gravels in upland settings has been mentioned. The deposits are believed to be erosional remnants of the massive
Rocky Mountain pediment that are referred to in
the High Plains as the Ogallala Formation. Known
locally as Uvalde Gravels, they typically include
waterworn clasts of quartzite, quartz, limestone,
petrified wood, jasper, and various cherts. They
are observed on upland divides between the Red
and Sulphur Rivers, and the Sulphur River and
White Oak Creek (Banks 1990:56-57). As yet
unnamed upland lag gravels containing rocks
sourced to Oklahoma and Arkansas also have
been noted in uplands of the Sulphur River basin (Banks 1990:56-57; Cliff and Hunt 1995:8).
The exploitation of specialized resources such as
lithic raw materials may result in archeological

sites in upland areas otherwise classified as low
probability settings for human activity; however
predicting their precise location is not feasible as
the placement of these cobbles on the landscape
is effectively random.
Geomorphic Processes
As noted above, much of the proposed Gulf
Crossing Project pipeline route traverses uplands
that are broken by many catchment and minor
drainages. The variable resistance of underlying
bedrock to erosion defines the locations of drainages and elevated landforms within this terrain.
In general, upland soils may be characterized
as deep, gently to steeply sloping, well-drained
sandy to loamy soils (USDA 2006). The prominent feature affecting soil depth in this setting is
the hill slope, a geologically dynamic landform
that is modified by erosion and deposition, and
which may be further altered by weathering and
mass movement such as sliding and slumping.
At the head of drainages, a head slope has a concave form with arms converging downward to the
drainage. Side slopes bound the drainageway in a
linear pattern, and opposed side slopes descend
to the valley bottoms. Adjacent drainageways are
separated by interfluves, which form the summit of a hill. Freshwater springs are identified
along interfluvial divides at the heads of drainages within the Cypress Creek basin (Thurmond
1990:12-13).
Uvalde gravels, an important source of
workable stone, can occur as remnants on ridge
divides in the Sulphur and Red River basins.
These resources can make interfluves relatively
high probability settings for prehistoric archeological sites, although the integrity of remains on
eroded summits may be compromised. Below the
summit or upland flat, the crest slope forms the
upper margin of drainages, followed by the midslope. The midslope of a hill is most susceptible
to erosion, and archeological sites are least likely
to be contained here because of surface instability, colluvial soil creep and because steep angles
are not suitable for most human activities (Butzer
1982:58-59; Davidson 1985:44). The foot of the
hill is located below its midslope and is also unstable, but receives erosional sediments from
above that generally accumulate to form a col9

luvial fan. Cultural remains are not uncommonly
found buried under colluvial debris at these locations (Gerrard 1981:11; Waters 1992:232).
The toeslope exhibits a flattening gradient as it
descends to the drainage edge, and may accumulate colluvial material originating from upslope,
as well as alluvial sediments deposited from the
drainage channel. Because of their relative stability and potential for reburial, these surfaces may
conceal intact cultural deposits (Treirweiler et al.
2002).
Cultural resources are usually restricted to
surface or near-surface deposits in upland settings because high landforms of Pleistocene age
predate the arrival of humans and may also be
susceptible to erosion. Few geoarcheological investigations have been undertaken in upland contexts within the project corridor, although deep
testing at elevated sites within the Red River basin in Bryan County, Oklahoma revealed shallow
and deflated soil contexts (Peter at al. 1991:75).
Subsurface testing performed during the Monticello Surface Mine survey in Titus County was
used to assess the potential for buried sites on the
upland divide between White Oak Creek and the
Cypress Creek basin (Jones et al. 1993:517). A
number of archeological sites were found to be
disturbed by deforestation in the recent past and
by colluvial deposition resulting from the removal
of stabilizing vegetative cover. The investigators
nevertheless observed occasional accumulations
of sandy, apparently windblown, sediment capable of sealing intact cultural deposits (Jones et
al. 1993:20). Sites situated on valley rims or low
angle slopes are likewise susceptible to burial by
eolian sediments, and gentle, sandy slopes overlooking marshy floodplains may have been used
for cultivation by Native American horticulturalist populations (Cliff and Hunt 1995:10). Preservation factors, along with lower site densities
compared to stream valleys, present challenges to
the development to the development of predictive
models in upland settings. Theoretically, low-intensity occupation of less favored landscapes can,
however, yield the benefit of greater frequencies
of single component sites with more analytic potential than those occupied repeatedly over time
(Thurmond 1990:220). Prehistoric and historic
site preferences naturally differ widely, as mod-

ern agricultural and water extraction technologies in many ways have rendered upland settings
more favorable for historic occupants than valley
landscapes.
Valleys are formed during the entrenchment
of streams, and broadly include rim, slope, and
floor topographic settings. Rims are upland margins that overlook valley floors. Valley slope settings may consist of lower-elevation projections
of upland ridges, such as ridge benches, or accumulated deposits of colluvial or alluvial origin
such as talus cones, colluvial aprons, or alluvial
fans. Valley rims and slopes are susceptible to
similar physical processes as those described for
upland landscapes. Valley floors contain a complex range of ancient and active surfaces, and are
described in more detail below.
As noted above, the Red River has an active
dynamic, migrating channel that has produced a
series of meander belts, each with lateral and vertical accretion landforms created when the river
occupied a separate course. Up to six surviving
meander belts have been recognized within the
Red River floodplain (Guccione 2004:66; Guccione and Hays, forthcoming). Alluvial terraces
are relatively level, having former floodplain surfaces on either side of a valley that have since
been abandoned by downcutting action. Alluvial
terraces are separated from new floodplains by an
erosional scarp. The multiple, stepped Quaternary terraces are well defined in the Red River and
Sulphur River valleys.
The age of an alluvial terrace increases with
the elevation of the landform. Conventional numbering of terraces begins with the present floodplain (T-0), and proceeds sequentially with age
(T-1, T-2, and so forth) (Jacobs 1980:70; Waters
1992:149-151). A meandering stream environment may bury (thus preserve) or destroy the
archeological record contained within it. The
vertical accretion, or accumulation, of sediments
that form alluvial terraces and fill oxbow lakes,
natural levees, and backswamps may seal archeological deposits created during periods of channel stability. Lateral migration of the channel
also erodes these sediments along with cultural
resources contained within them. Until a channel is abandoned, the cutbank of a meandering
river continually erodes the natural levee and any

concealed evidence of human occupation. Lateral
migration of the channel results in the simultaneous aggradation of sediments on its point bar,
providing a suitable setting for the formation of
stratified sites, albeit possibly in secondary context (Collins 2004:106-107). Historic maps dating
between 1872 and 1958 show that the Red River
channel paralleling the project area was displaced
as much as a mile and a half from the 1872 course
(Albert 1984: Figure 16). This migration, and the
apparent depth and young age of floodplain and
T1 terrace deposits (see Geology and Soils), may
account for the paucity of cultural resources recorded on these landforms.

areas could be more easily converted to farm
or range land than forested parcels (Pettula and
Nathan 1989:41-42). These same grasses are the
dominant vegetation in the Blackland Prairie district to the west, where clay soils that formed atop
chalk and marl bedrock provide a poor matrix for
plant communities with larger root systems. In
contrast, the sandy loam soils in the east of the
region support a dense forest overstory similar to
that of the Post Oak Savanna, but with two pine
species, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), among the dominant
trees. In many areas, pine represents a subclimax
community requiring disturbance, such as fire,
to compete with native hardwood species (Thurmond 1990:14).
Crosscutting these biotic districts are floodplain type plant communities that occupy the Red
River valley and major drainages of the region.
These environments support a more mesic, mature forest, with hackberry (Celtis occidentalis),
slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), water oak (Quercus
nigra), overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), white oak
(Quercus alba), water hickory (Carya aquatica),
American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), cottonwood (Populus deltoids), willow (Salix nigra),
pecan (Carya illinoensis), and red maple (Acer
rubrum) among the more common trees. A variety of fruit-bearing plants are reported in floodplain and near-floodplain contexts within the
Cypress River basin, including wild blackberry,
elderberry, grape, wild blackberry, Chickasaw
plum, and wild strawberry (Thurmond 1990: Table 2). A list of trees recorded on the north side
of the Red River in southern Bryan County by
General Land Office surveyors in 1872 has been
compiled by Albert (1984:36-39, Table 7). Bottomland communities include many of the above
mentioned species, along with cottonwood, sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and willow. Pecan,
bois d’arc/Osage orange (Maclura pomifera),
cedar (probably Juniperus virginiana), mulberry
(Morus rubra), walnut (probably Juglans nigra),
pin oak (Quercus palustris), and white oak (probably Quercus alba) also were recorded.
Reconstructions of ancient vegetation communities, based largely on pollen records, indicate that the biotic districts of the region probably
achieved their modern character between 3000-

Flora and Fauna
The project corridor crosses three biotic /
physiographic districts that are recognized in
northeast Texas: the Blackland Prairie in the
west; the pine forests known as the Pineywoods
in the east; and a transitional zone supporting a
patchwork of oak-hickory woodland and prairie
known as the Post Oak Savanna, which intergrades with communities to the west and east
(Blair 1950). The Post Oak Savanna ecotone occupies a southwest-northeast trending belt which
extends deep into east-central Texas, and northeast across Oklahoma (where it is known as the
Osage Savanna district) and thence into Kansas
and Missouri. Locally, it has a patchy distribution across the upper reaches of the Sulphur River
basin. The district supports a mosaic of tall grass
prairie and broadleaf deciduous trees, which interdigitate throughout uplands of the area (Albert and Wyckoff 1984:22-26; Blair and Hubble
1938:432-435). Dominant trees include Post oak
(Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), and black hickory (Carya texana), with
an understory of smooth sumac (Rhus glabra),
coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus), mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and varieties of fruit-bearing
plums and grapes. Prairie complexes include big
bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), switch grass (Panicum virgatum),
and buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides). Grasslands in proximity to good timber were favored
by historic settlers of the region, because such

5000 years ago, following a warm and dry climate regime in which grassland components were
more extensive (Albert and Wyckoff 1984:38;
Collins and Bousman 1993:59). Significant fluctuations in precipitation, and probably grassland/
forest boundaries, are documented throughout
the Holocene, most recently during droughts that
occurred between the 1930s and 1950s (Perttula
2004b:371; Wyckoff 1984a:17-20). Over 40 percent of the land in Bryan County has recently
been recorded as cropland, 22 percent as pasture,
and 23 percent as forest (Huffman et al. 1978:10).
Although land clearance and fire control can ultimately favor the spread of immature pine and
scrubby forest, historic data point to a decrease
of mature hardwood forest in the greater project
region over the past century because of clearance for farming and timber harvesting activities (Albert 1984:36; Wyckoff 1984a:18). Thurmond (1990:14), for example, notes that most
virgin forest growth in the Cypress Creek basin
was quickly destroyed following Euro-American
settlement of the area, and that the 40 percent of
land currently considered forested is essentially
all secondary growth.
In its pre-modern state, the biotic districts of
the greater region provided an abundance of resources for early inhabitants, and the use of some
of these plants is documented both ethnographically and in the archeological record (Cliff and
Hunt 1995:11-12; Drass 1997: Table 3; Wyckoff
1984a: Table 1). Upland forests, for instance, produced a high volume of nuts, notably acorns and
hickory, while grasses yielded edible seeds and
grains and also could be used for thatch. Fruit,
roots, and shoots of sumac were also consumed.
Wetter bottomlands additionally provided the
fruits noted above, oily and high-protein nuts
(pecan, walnut), dye and cordage (cottonwood),
and construction poles (willow). The Osage orange supplied superb bow wood, and was likely
traded throughout the region in Late Prehistoric
times (Schambach 2000:8-10).
Because it supports forest and prairie biotic
regimes, the Osage Savanna district provided
habitat for a wide variety of animal species that
were hunted or collected by both prehistoric and
historic peoples (Albert and Wyckoff 1984: Tables 1.4-1.6; Thurmond 1990: Table 2; Wyckoff

1984a: Table 2). Larger herd mammals such as
bison (Bison bison), and antelope (Antilocapra
Americana) were once plentiful in grasslands of
the region, while white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), elk (Cervus canadensis), black
bears (Ursus americanus), red and gray wolves
(Canis rufus, Canis lupus), and the bobcat (Lynx
rufus) inhabited the forests or forest margins.
Most of these animals were hunted both for food
and pelts. Smaller prairie species included the
badger (Taxidea taxus), prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), and
ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), with opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), fox
squirrel (Sciurus niger), gray fox (Urocyon cinereroargentus), and numerous species of mouse
present in wooded habitats. Valley bottomlands
contained beaver (Castor canadensis), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), mink (Mustela vison), river otter (Lutra Canadensis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus).
Waterfowl such as mallard (Anas platyrhynchos),
Canada goose (Branta Canadensis), and snow
goose (Chen hyperborea) were present seasonally
during migrations, and other birds provided more
reliable game, such as the wild turkey (Meleagris
gallapavo), greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus
cupido), and bobwhite quail (Colinus virgianius).
A great variety of turtles, mussels, and fish also
were available in stream settings of the region.
Climate
Northeast Texas currently experiences a
subtropical climate that is characterized by short,
mild winters and long, hot summers (Cole and
Steers 1978; Hart 1974; Huffman et al. 1978).
Temperatures in January average 45 degrees F.,
and in August average 83 degrees F. with a mean
maximum exceeding 95 degrees F. The region is
classified as humid, with an average annual rainfall of 43 inches, most of which falls in April and
May. Average winter snowfall is less than three

frequent thunderstorm activity during the warmer
months. These storms are occasionally severe,
and can result in flooding and soil erosion. The

crops. Summer droughts are also not uncommon;
these could affect crop productivity and have
necessitated extensive field irrigation networks.
Possible effects of episodic drought on late prehistoric inhabitants of the region—in particular,
those producing corn—has also been noted (Albert 1984:29; Perttula and Nathan 1989:43-44),

and drought is invoked as the cause of community collapse among southerly Caddo groups of
northeast Texas in the 15th century A.D. (Perttula
and Rogers 2007:91-92). Broad climate trends in
the region throughout prehistory are highlighted

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian Period (ca. 11,500-8000
B.P.) represents the first documented human occupation on the North American continent. Despite its distance, the retreat of the Wisconsin
stade glaciers from the northern United States
affected the climate regime of the study region.
This effect, known as the Anathermal, resulted in
wetter and cooler climes than any since experienced (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:39). The Late
Pleistocene landscape, ranging from relatively
dense woodland in the eastern coastal reaches to
open savannah lands in the west, supported a diverse array of mammals, including now-extinct
megafauna that were hunted by early Paleo-Indian groups.
Signature stone artifacts that are diagnostic
of this time include fluted lanceolate projectile
points of the Clovis (ca. 11,500-10,900 B.P.) and
Folsom (ca. 10,900-10,200 B.P.) types, along with
unfluted variants known for both. While Clovistype sites occur throughout the North American
continent, the Folsom fluted spear point variant
appears to be limited geographically to the Plains
ecotone, with northeast Texas and northwest
Louisiana being situated at the southeast edge of
its distribution range (Justice 1987:17-29).
The Clovis complex stands as the oldest
known formal point technology that was adapted
to spear hafting (Frison 1991:289-298; Holliday
1997:177-182). Controversial artifact distribution
studies suggest that the people entering the New
World from eastern Asia did not carry this flutedpoint technology with them. If so, earlier population intrusions within the study region are possible, based on an assumption that these people
did not utilize a distinctive set of lithic tools (Anderson and Faught 1998:176; Waters and Stafford
2007). For example, Dillehay’s (2000:281-291)

uch of the archeologically-defined prehistory of northeast Texas is associated
with the geographical belt known as
the Trans-Mississippi South. It is a broad ecological region that represents the transition between the eastern Woodland and the Southern
Plains. From east to west, general ecotonal variations within this area range from the forests of
the Pineywoods Post Oak Savanna, and into the
Blackland Prairie. These relatively expansive categories, however, are made more complex by the
“eastern” subsistence base that the rich Red and
Sulphur River valleys were capable of supporting
at most times. The Red River, in particular, can
be perceived as a thoroughfare of cultural transmission, with Bruseth (1998:47) noting that the
cultural connections are not only east-west, but
span the river—and therefore state boundaries—
as well. From the Woodland Period forward, archeology along the Red River has usually been
interpreted through the eastern Caddo culture
sequence, although many acknowledge the existence of Plains elements in assemblages west of
the Kiamichi-Red River confluence in Oklahoma.
Given the breadth of its reach and the diversity of
researchers’ interpretations, no single chronology
can be applied consistently to the greater project
region.
The discussion that follows uses chronologies largely drawn from Bousman et al. (2004),
(1984), Bruseth (1998), Drass (1997), Perttula
(2004b), Schambach (2001), and Story et al.
(1990). It draws occasionally on evidence to the
east, west, and north of the greater project region.
From the earliest to most recent cultural eras, the
Native American chronological categories discussed are the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Woodland,
Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Periods (Table 3.1).

recently argued for a broader subsistence base
that included a wide range of large and small
mammals, fish, and reptiles (Blackmar 2001:7680; Bousman et al. 2004:75-82). Use-wear analysis of stone tools indicates that, unsurprisingly,
plants also were processed (Martin 2005:128).
The Cooperton [34KI26] site in western
Oklahoma potentially represents the earliest
known occupation site in the greater region, with
radiocarbon dates as early as 17,000 – 21,000
B.P., which would well precede Clovis occupations (Anderson 1975; Wyckoff and Czaplewski
1997). The tool assemblage reportedly includes
cobble hammerstones and a stone anvil, although
the cultural origin of the material remains in dispute (Hofman and Graham 1998:91). Accepted
Early Paleo-Indian sites of the Clovis complex
are generally rare in Texas; it is unknown whether this is because of sparse population density,
group movements that involve little recurrent occupation of landforms, poor site preservation, or
a combination of these factors (Meltzer and Bever 1995:62). Most of the excavated Clovis and
Folsom sites in the Texas and Oklahoma plains
have, to date, been limited to large mammal kill

work at Monte Verde in southern Chile supports
the peopling of North America prior to 12,500
B.P.. While a pre-11,500 B.P. human presence is
accepted by some archeologists, by definition the
tool assemblages of these earliest hunters must
evade clear characterization (Hofman and Graham 1998:87-93), making corroboration of these
claims difficult, to say the least.
In contrast, investigations focused slightly
to the west in the Plains region have yielded a
number of Clovis and Folsom spear points at kill
sites. These artifacts often were found in secure
context alongside the remains of mammoth and
the bones of an extinct form of bison (Bison antiquus). Such finds have resulted in Paleo-Indian
people often being simply categorized as nomadic hunters that followed migratory big game. Additional factors in favor of this analysis included
the sparse, ephemeral nature of these kill sites
and the sometimes long-distances involved from
known outcrops of the stone used in the tools left
behind (Hofman 1989a:31-33; Hofman and Graham 1998:116-118; Kelly and Todd 1988:239).
Discussions of Paleo-Indian lifeways that garner
evidence from other types of sites, however, have

locations. Some of the better documented sites
include Miami [41RB1], Lake Theo [41BI70],
Plainview [41HL1], Domebo [34CD50], Cooper
[34HP45], and Waugh [34HP42] (Sellards 1938,
Holliday 1997; Sellards 1946; Leonhardy and
Anderson 1966; Bement 1997; Hill and Hofman
1997).
Two well-documented occupations, potential campsites, are situated in Denton County to
the west of the project area. These sites, Lewisville [41DN72] and Aubrey [41DN479], are located on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Both
sites contain Clovis horizons with multiple hearth
features and a diverse faunal assemblage. The latter include the remains of megafauna and also an
array of small animal species, providing confirmatory evidence to the theory described above of
Paleo-Indian people using a diverse subsistence
base (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001; Martin 2005). The Forrest Murphey site [41MR62]
is currently one of the only other known PaleoIndian locations in the area. This was an interesting but poorly documented site in the Cypress
Creek basin, south of the project corridor. A Clovis point and Late Paleo-Indian artifacts were recovered by a collector in the early 1960s; a mastodon tooth was reportedly found in association
with the Clovis point on a high river terrace. The
site, however, was destroyed during construction
of a dam at Lake O’ the Pines, and was never excavated by professional archeologists (Thurmond
1990:174).
The period between 11,000 and 8000 B.P.
marks the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, during which a warmer and drier climate replaced the
previous regime. Pollen sequences derived from
two locations in southeast Oklahoma, Ferndale
Bog and Jenkins Reilly Slough, suggest an expansion of grassland along the prairie-woodland
margins accompanied by a reduction in oak and
other trees (Albert and Wyckoff 1984:38). Similar environmental shifts likely affected the project area in northeast Texas (Perttula 2004b:371).
Greater seasonal temperature extremes constricted the range and diversity of plant and animal
species, which by the end of the Paleo-Indian Period were essentially modern biota (Hofman et al.
1989:158-159; Kay 1998a:23-24).

The identification of Late Paleo-Indian site
assemblages (ca. 10,000-8000 B.P.) is characterized by unfluted lanceolate projectile points
/ knife forms that are collectively referred to as
Plano complex tools; these include Plainview,
Agate Basin, and Hell Gap point forms. Justice
(1987) extends the range of these types well to
the east of the project area, as have others (e.g.,
Cantley et al. 1984; Hillman 1990:206-207,
who attributed Plainview components to sites in
northern Louisiana). A recent study of site distributions, however, indicates that apart from Plainview points, these stone tool components are rare
in the eastern portion of Texas (Bousman et al.
2004:71-75). Further, those authors concur with
Story (1990:177) that the Plainview point “type”
has, due to a cumulative effect of poor definition
by researchers, now become a catch-all category
with very limited utility. They instead recommend
that late Paleo-Indian site distributions in eastern
Texas should focus on Dalton, San Patrice, and
Scottsbluff lanceolate tool types; for northeast
Texas distributions, Dalton point forms are considered to be particularly diagnostic evidence of
a Late Paleo-Indian occupation.
Scottsbluff spear points with straightstemmed bases have traditionally been categorized to the Cody complex, which is an archeological construct that focuses on Late Paleo-Indian bison-hunting activity sites in the Plains (e.g.,
Gettys 1984; Hofman and Graham 1998). A reinterpretation of the evidence have led Bousman
et al. (2004) to propose that the Texas specimens
may well derive from a woodland/prairie ecotone
adaptation. Blackmar (2001:78-80) reaching a
similar conclusion, notes that “Cody people appear to have been recurrent inhabitants of the
Woodlands,” and suggests that there may be two
adaptations—Plains and Woodland—for this
complex. Making these interpretations more difficult is the fact that Scottsbluff artifacts very frequently occur as surface finds or are known from
private collections, but are poorly documented in
properly excavated, stratified contexts in northeast Texas (Baugh et al. 2004:111).
Dalton and San Patrice artifact traditions
are firmly rooted in the forested Southeast,
with characteristics that intergrade sufficiently

Chapter III: Cultural Setting
for them to be considered related; thus Justice
(1987) includes San Patrice variants as part of
the Dalton complex or cluster. Signature Dalton
artifacts include spear points with concave bases
and stone adzes used for wood working. Sites are
well documented in Arkansas and Missouri, but
also bridge prairie environments of eastern Oklahoma and Kansas, as well as Texas (Ballenger
2001; Hofman 1996:75; Hofman and Graham
1998:115-116). Some consider the Dalton complex to have developed directly from the eastern
Clovis tradition (Story 1990:190). Dalton artifacts
have been recovered from the Forrest Murphey
site, mentioned above, as well as at the Culpepper
[41HP1], Womack [41LR1], Wells [41DN11],
and Wright Plantation [41RR7] sites, all of which
lie within the Red River basin of northeast Texas.
San Patrice variants were first identified at sites
in northwest Louisiana (Webb 1946) and subsequently recovered from southern Arkansas and
from within the Louisiana Red River valley at the
John Pearce site [16CD56], not far from the project area (Webb et al. 1971). The spear points have
concave bases, but are short-bladed and typically
fluted and side-notched. A tool known as the Albany scraper, which is notched for hafting, is another distinctive tool form that is indicative of a
San Patrice tool assemblage.
The use of local raw materials to manufacture stone tools is a criterion often used by archeologists to demarcate a temporal break from the
Paleo-Indian to Archaic Periods. The San Patrice
culture in northeastern Texas appears to exhibit
this transition in lifeways: namely, adaptation to
specific environmental regions and more intensive exploitation of local resources, suggesting a
reduction in territory size and mobility that becomes more pronounced in subsequent Archaic
times (Ballenger 1999). The range of prehistoric
bison at the prairie/woodland margins is not well
understood, but scholars have doubted the presence of large numbers of these animals in forest settings, including eastern Texas (Blackmar
2001:66; Bruseth and Perttula 1981:5). While a
heavy reliance on smaller, anatomically modern
bison is apparent at some Late Paleo-Indian sites
in the Plains region, most other sites scattered
throughout Texas show a broader level of animal
subsistence through the remains of fish, reptiles,

amphibians, birds, mussels, antelope, deer, and
numerous small mammals such as rabbits, prairie dogs, and squirrels. Though rarely preserved
in the archeological record, plant remains also
have been occasionally recovered that confirm
their use as subsistence foods (Bousman et al.
2004:82-83).
In summary, although well documented sites
are rare, small surface assemblages and isolated
finds of lanceolate projectile points nevertheless
demonstrate the presence of Paleo-Indian hunters
and foragers throughout northeast Texas, including the project area (Bousman et al. 2004: Figures
2.45-2.46; Meltzer and Bever 1995:58-59; Perttula 2004b:373). Widely dispersed artifacts are
usually noted on older, higher terraces and in upland settings adjacent to major drainages, which
illustrates the mobility of these groups but also
perhaps the inaccessibility of intact assemblages
on most surfaces in the large river valleys they
may have preferred (Perttula 2004b:373-374).
Thurmond (1990: Figure 7) includes 40 Paleo-Indian components in his inventory of the Cypress
Creek basin south of the project corridor. The
majority are Late Paleo-Indian occupations containing Dalton, Scottsbluff, and San Patrice tool
assemblages. Clovis and Folsom components are
identified at two sites, 16CD23 and 41CP27, located at the west and east ends of the drainage
basin, respectively.
Regionally, observation of Clovis points are
limited to isolated occurrences within the Red
River, Trinity River, and Sulphur River drainages,
with much of the distribution derived from private
collections (Meltzer and Bever 1995:58). The
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory files in
Austin indicate three Paleo-Indian manifestations
within the Sulphur River basin of Titus County.
Sites 41TT60 and 41TT79 represent surface finds
from the 1970s by Milton Bell, an archeologist
with the Texas State Department of Highways
and Transportation. A Folsom point was found at
the former, and a Dalton point at the latter. In both
instances the Paleo-Indian component was mixed
with later materials. Four lanceolate points were
retrieved by a private collector during construction of a pond, marked as Site 41TT642. One of
the artifacts, a Scottsbluff point, was indicative of
a Paleo-Indian occupation.

Chapter III: Cultural Setting
Archaic Period
The Early and Middle Archaic Periods (ca.
8000-4000 B.P.) overlap with the mid-continent
Altithermal climatic optimum, an intense warm
and dry climate episode that expanded grasslands
and reduced forested areas at the prairie margins.
It is believed by many researchers that the Altithermal change ultimately was a catalyst that precipitated changes in human settlement patterns within
the region. An eastern dispersal of Plains hunting
and gathering bands is one hypothesized response,
and may account for the greater numbers of Archaic sites recorded in eastern portions of Oklahoma
and Texas (Wyckoff and Brooks 1983:260-263;
Perttula 2004a: Figure 1.5).
Interpretations of Archaic adaptation strategies are usually linked to there being an increased
seasonal variability of resources but a decrease in
species diversity because of the xeric conditions.
These factors may have encouraged cyclical exploitation of resources, resulting in repeated occupations of some sites (Hofman et al. 1989:161163; Perttula 2004b:374-375) and the possible
accentuation of territorial divisions. An increased
number of identified Archaic sites, compared to the
Paleo-Indian Period, also suggest rising population
levels. Features such as rock-lined hearths, roasting pits, and fire-cracked rock middens become increasingly evident at Archaic occupations, particularly late in the period. These features and tools
such as hafted knives, axes, and grinding stones
suggest that plant processing became increasingly
important (Kay 1998b:192; Cliff 1994:25).
In wooded regions, a greater focus on riverine environments for subsistence is indicated, with
hardwood nuts figuring prominently in the Archaic
diet (Perttula 2004b:374). To the west, bison appear
to have been scarce until late in the Archaic, and
an emphasis on smaller animals, including mussels and fish, persists throughout the period in the
Central and Southern Plains (Hofman 1996:211;
Wyckoff 1992:179-183). Signature Archaic tool
assemblages include a great variety of stemmed
and (later) notched dart points adapted for atlatl,
or spear thrower, use. The greater diversity in tool
kits from Paleo-Indian times is believed to reflect
increasingly specialized adaptations to local food
resources. An evolutionary sequence of projectile
point forms for this long period in northeast Texas

prehistory was advanced by Johnson (1962) based
on his excavations of stratified levels at the Yarbrough Site [41VN6] in the Sabine River drainage
to the south of the project area. This typological
system was subsequently refined by Story (1990)
and Thurmond (1990).
There is little indication that Early Archaic
groups were limited to bounded territories, and
the subsistence pattern at this time is not easily
distinguished from the mobile foraging strategies
of Paleo-Indian groups. The most obvious differences are recurrent, seasonal occupations of base
camps for hunting and collecting edible plants that
are occasionally seen at sites with heavy, overlapping concentrations of lithic artifacts (Bruseth and
Perttula 1981:139-141; Thurmond 1990:41). Tools
associated with plant processing—such as nutting
stones, milling stones, and manos—occasionally
occur at this time, but commonly utilized plants
including acorns, hickory nuts, and walnuts could
be hulled and eaten without additional processing
or cooking (Larson 1980). Early Archaic culture
in northeast Texas also is difficult to characterize
because of a scarcity of published excavations.
Somewhat further afield, the Conly Site [16BI19]
in northwest Louisiana revealed a deeply buried,
dense midden dating between 7500 and 8000 B.P.,
along with pits filled with fire-cracked rock, possible post molds, and several human burials. Faunal and botanical remains indicate a mixed diet of
deer, fish, shellfish, and acorn and hickory nuts
(Girard 2001). One of the better known Plains sites
of this period is Gore Pit [34MC131] in southwest
Oklahoma, a repeated-use food processing camp
that contained at least 30 rock-lined hearths or ovens, some of which were probably used for baking plants and mussels (Kay 1998b:192; Hofman
1989a:54-55). Generally, however, sites on the
north side of the Red River, including Pumpkin
Creek [34LV49], Mahaffey [34CH1], and Hill
[34PU58] appear to be campsites of fairly short
duration (Wyckoff and Taylor 1971; Perino and
Bennett 1978; Rohrbaugh 1972). In northeast
Texas, the commonly identified Early Archaic dart
points tend to have straight or expanding stems,
and include Bulverde, Dawson, Kirk, Keithville,
Palmer, and Cossitot types.
While Archaic culture units are not formally defined in northeast Texas, tools assigned to

Chapter III: Cultural Setting
Middle Archaic complexes in adjacent regions
are sometimes recognized. One such grouping
includes sites containing artifacts associated with
the Carrollton focus of the Trinity aspect, an archeological complex first identified at a number
of sites within the Upper Trinity River basin of
north-central Texas. Distinctive dart points, axes,
net weights, and grinding implements are indicative of Carrollton focus assemblages (Crook and
Harris 1952; see also Martin 2005). Between the
Upper Trinity drainage and the project area is
a belt of the Post Oak Savanna ecotone, which
is the focus of Ross C. Fields’ chapter in Perttula’s (2004b) volume of Texas prehistory. One of
the few Middle Archaic components in this area
forms the lowest horizon at the Finley Fan site
[41HP159] on Cooper Lake in the upper reaches
of the Sulphur River. Fields (2004:349-350) describes the recovery of four burned rock features
and a small number of artifacts which probably
represent short-term residential occupations, a pattern which seems to characterize this biotic region
throughout the Archaic Period. The combined
evidence appears to be too meager to permit comparison with the Trinity aspect, although stratified
Carrollton horizons have been recorded well to the
east on the Oklahoma side of the Red River, parallel to the Gulf Crossing Project pipeline corridor
(Wyckoff 1984b:136). Another Middle Archaic
complex, Tom’s Brook, is interpreted through sites
having a riverine adaptation. Best documented in
western Arkansas, it also includes open campsites
that extend well into east Oklahoma and probably
northeast Texas as well (Schambach 2003). The
creation of these occupation sites has been linked
to slower and more stable stream flow during the
warmer climate, resulting in slackwater and shoal
habitats that sustained aquatic animals for long
periods (Smith 1991:51). Apart from projectile
points, assemblages include T-shaped drills, tool
blanks, grinding stones, and occasional bone tools
(Wyckoff 1984b:136-140). Finally, the Calf Creek
complex is a nomadic Middle Archaic culture with
a broad geographical distribution that is defined
almost solely by large, basally-notched projectile
points. Though it is known mainly through surface finds in northeast Texas, the culture is better
documented in the adjacent parts of Oklahoma
where larger tool caches and several stone outcrop

sources have been found. Broad similarities in tool
form suggest interregional mobility of Calf Creek
groups (Andrews 1999; Bartlett 1994; Wyckoff
et al. 1993). Straight or expanding-stemmed dart
points are also characteristic of Middle Archaic
assemblages in northeast Texas; apart from Calf
Creek, Carrollton, and Trinity forms, these can include dart types of the Morrill, Evans, Lone Oak,
and Johnson classes.
The Late Archaic (ca. 4000-2000 B.P.) is
marked by the onset of the Medithermal episode,
during which the climate cooled from the highs of
the previous optimum and forests on the prairie
margins again expanded westward. Experimentation with horticulture may have been underway in
the Midwest and Southeast, but little evidence has
emerged for the practice in northeast Texas or the
Central and Southern Plains (Perttula 2004b:376;
Hofman 1996:99; Kay 1998b:194-195). The density of Late Archaic occupations is greater compared to earlier sub-stages. In the Plains, some associate the return of bison with this trend (Hughes
1991), but sites in the eastern Plains margins and
woodlands continue to show an emphasis on deer
and a variety of small animals (Brooks and Drass
1984:26; Jenkins 1974). Population increases in
northeast Texas are indicated, but also notable is
an expansion into a greater range of environments,
including terraces and upland landforms near
large rivers, small tributaries, and springs. The site
distributions suggest that populations may have
become increasingly “tethered” to smaller territories and the resources available within them
(Cliff 1994:25; Perttula 2004b:374-376). Dart
points with contracting stems such as Gary and
Kent are considered broadly diagnostic of Late
Archaic occupations, but only in sites lacking a
ceramic component since both types also extend
into the later Early Woodland (or Ceramic) Period.
The expanding-stem Ensor point, in contrast, is at
present solely associated with Late Archaic site assemblages.
Relatively few well-stratified Late Archaic
components have been documented in excavations,
but among these sites are Yarbrough [41VN6] and
Herman Bellew [41RK222] in the Sabine River
drainage, and Unionville [41CS151] and Mockingbird [41TT550] in the Sulphur River drainage.
Most of these sites yielded burned rock features and

artifacts, and sometimes earthen pits; botanical and
faunal remains are not often preserved, although
wild plant foods were recovered at the Unionville
site (Cliff et al. 1996; Fields et al. 1993:70; Perttula 2004b:376). Similar types of assemblages have
been excavated on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River in north-central Texas (Prikryl 1990). Yarbrough
[41VN6] also contained a midden deposit, which
is indicative of long-term occupation. Three sites
on the Oklahoma side of the Lake Texoma area,
Boat Dock [34MA1], Buncombe Creek [34MA2],
and James [34BR11] also contain midden accumulations (Bell and Bastian 1958; Wyckoff 1964;
Ray 1960), though not the thick, material-rich deposits characteristic of the contemporaneous Wister culture unit in eastern Oklahoma (Galm 1984).
Similarities have been noted between the artifact
recoveries from these Oklahoma sites and those of
the Elam focus in north-central Texas, a Late Archaic successor to the Carrollton focus south of the
study area (Brooks and Drass 1984:25-26; Crook
and Harris 1952). Little can be found in the literature that relates Elam to points east along the Texas
side of the Red River, although Prikryl (1990:74)
has noted the difficulties in identifying Elam assemblages, as originally defined, at a number of
north-central Texas sites.
There is little to link the study region with the
complex mound building culture that originated
during the Middle Archaic in the Lower Mississippi Valley and fluoresced into the Poverty Point
culture in the Carroll Parishes of Louisiana during
the Late Archaic. Sites with multiple mounds in
northeast and southeast Louisiana characterize the
earlier sub-stage, and some research suggests that
a close relationship existed between the northeastern groups and what is termed the “Evans Point
Horizon” (Saunders 2003). Poverty Point, defined
by the type site of that name in East Carroll Parish
in the northeast corner of Louisiana, is best known
for its massive public architecture in the form of
earthworks and long distance trade, while still
maintaining a hunting and foraging economy. Its
riverine location was ideal for exploiting the flow
of trade goods from other regions, such as lithic
materials that have been sourced to long-distances
in other Midwestern and Southern states. A rich
and varied material culture included both stone
and ceramic vessels, clay figurines, atlatl weights,

plummets, gorgets, jasper beads, and pendants.
Seed processing implements, stone hoe blades,
nutting stones, and milling stones have been associated with harvesting and processing of wild
plants (Gibson 1974, 2000; Webb 1982). While
Poverty Point projectile point types have been recovered in northwest Louisiana, other markers of
the culture, including mounds, are rare or absent
in the region. Likewise, the later Archaic groups
in northeast Texas apparently lay outside of the
Poverty Point interaction sphere, based on artifacts
produced almost entirely from local stone as well
as the absence of the elaborate types of goods that
were possessed by their neighbors to the east.
Most of the extensive site inventories conducted in northeast Texas to date have been affected by the presence of intermixed artifact assemblages. Although numerous Archaic components
are recognized, relatively few of these occur on
the surface as discrete manifestations. Low artifact
densities also compound attempts at chronological
control, making it difficult for researchers to distinguish between Early, Middle and Late sub-stages
with certainty, or to venture functional classifications where features are absent. These problems
have been acknowledged during work in the Sulphur River basin, the Lake Fork Reservoir on the
Sabine River, along the Red River, and elsewhere
(Albert 1984:135; Bruseth and Perttula 1981:133;
Fields et al. 1993:70; Perttula and Nathan 1989:67;
Wyckoff and Brooks 1983:75-77).
Thurmond’s detailed study of previously recorded sites in the Cypress Creek drainage basin
is exceptional in assigning tripartite Archaic substage divisions based on diagnostic artifacts, although few single-component sites are identified.
Density and distribution patterns through time
show a steady increase in the number of sites from
the Early Archaic (with 51 components) to the
Late Archaic (with 123 components). In the earlier
periods, sites tend to be found on alluvial terraces
or upland landforms adjacent to major waterways,
whereas Late Archaic occupations also extend to
smaller drainages. In all periods, sites are most
densely clustered in the upper, western reaches of
the Cypress Creek basin (1990:8-10).
A total of 24 Archaic components occur within the Gulf Crossing Project corridor, the majority
of which are in Titus County on the White Oak

Creek branch of the Sulphur River. A single site,
41TT560, is assigned a Late Archaic date, and is at
least not obviously mixed with pre- or post-Archaic occupations. The remaining sites are unspecified
Archaic, although Gary points, sometimes accompanied by Darl and Yarbrough types, are noted at
several (41LR92, 41MX30, 41TT63, 41TT72, and
41TT790) and may indicate Late Archaic occupations. Only two sites (41FK77 and 41TT616) have
yielded evidence of burned rock features, and the
former is a multi-component manifestation. Most
of these Archaic sites occupy ridges in valley slope
settings, but valley floor and upland contexts are
also represented.

population also were interred there (Schambach
2001:43; Schilling 2002).
The adoption of “Plains Woodland” terminology in the Plains and along the prairie/savanna margins has its origins in eastern (particularly Ohio)
Hopewellian archeology; its application west of
the Missouri River reflects a tradition of associating developments in the Plains with eastern influences. Increasingly, however, scholars recognize
the significance of indigenous innovations during this time (Johnson and Johnson 1998). Apart
from the addition of arrow points, small amounts
of pottery, and the prevalence of plant processing
equipment in assemblages, adaptive strategies in
the Plains Woodland region, in the main, continue
from those of the preceding Archaic Period (Hofman and Brooks 1989:61). As well, the introduction of tropical cultigens such as maize may have
occurred at discrete times and places in the Plains
region, but research points to the greater role of
indigenous annuals in early agriculture (Adair
1996:104). Paleoenvironmental reconstructions
tend to favor a cooler and wetter climate in the first
millennium A.D., and the concomitant reduction of
pasture land may account for the scarcity of bison
remains at sites of the period (Brown 1998:169;
Dillehay 1974; Kay 1998a:28).
Fourche Maline is characterized as a conservative culture that occupied the eastern Woodlandsouthern Plains ecotone, known as the Trans-Mississippi South, for the duration of the Woodland
Period. First recognized in the Ouachita Mountains of southeast Oklahoma and southwest Arkansas, the culture area is now known to extend
across much of northwest Louisiana and northeast
Texas (Schambach 1998, 2001, 2002). In Oklahoma, Fourche Maline occupations directly succeed the Archaic Wister culture, and mounds are
frequently a palimpsest of both (Galm 1984). Single component sites are recognized in Arkansas,
with Schambach (2001:21) demonstrating considerable time depth to the Fourche Maline culture
(1000/500 B.C.-A.D. 800), including dates that
also span the Late Archaic and Plains Woodland
sequences. Material assemblages include plain
ceramic vessels, mostly flat-bottomed jars, with
Williams Plain (grog tempered) and Cooper Boneware (bone tempered, with interior slip) being

Woodland Period
The Woodland Period (ca. 2500-1000 B.P.
or 500 B.C.-A.D. 1000) is marked by changes in
the material culture, subsistence base, and possibly socio-political systems of prehistoric groups
throughout much of eastern North America (Anderson and Mainfort 2002; Vehik 1984:175-176).
The widespread use of ceramic vessels, invention
of the bow and arrow, incipient horticulture, and
sedentism in settlements are traditionally attributed
to this period, although each aspect did not occur
everywhere at the same time; in many areas of the
Southeast, they arrive quite late in the Woodland
sequence. Evidence for maize agriculture remains
almost non-existent in the Southeast throughout
the Woodland period. Normally preceded by the
cultivation of indigenous starchy and oily seed
plants such as goosefoot, sumpweed, maygrass,
and sunflower (Anderson and Mainfort 2002:8-9,
14), domesticated plants are absent altogether in
southern portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley
which shows that people continued to have easy
access to wild plants (Kidder 2002:70-71, 74). Despite the absence of a strong agricultural base, in
some areas, including the Adena/Hopewell culture
area and the Trans-Mississippi South, mound ceremonialism developed and was accompanied by
preferential burial practices, suggesting the emergence of social elites. Some argue that social stratification was less pronounced among the Lower
Mississippi Valley moundbuilders, however, as
evidence indicates that members of the general

most common. Double-bitted axes or hoes, possibly for the cultivation of starchy and oily seed
plants, are also typical artifacts. Botancial remains
are not yet documented at Fourche Maline, but as
Schambach points out, excavation methodologies
to recover the tiny seeds have not generally been
applied to the excavations (Schambach 2001:3840). Contracting-stemmed dart points of the Gary
type are the signature projectiles of the culture, but
are replaced late in the sequence by arrow points
for use with the bow and arrow. Fourche Maline
assemblages also can contain boatstones and clay
platform pipes.
Fourche Maline settlements generally are
small upland sites or small to medium sized villages that were situated in major river valley lowlands. Distinctive features are rich, black midden
mounds, which represent long-term accumulations of debris. These clearly indicate a degree
of permanence yet, interestingly, stone celts that
would be used to cut wood are absent from assemblages, and evidence for house construction does
not appear until very late in the culture sequence.
The middens frequently contain community burials with flexed or extended individuals in shallow
pits; grave goods are reportedly rare from these
contexts. Dome-shaped burial mounds of modest
size were also built, initially over cremated remains
and later in the period incorporating uncremated
remains within the construction. Prestige goods in
these burials suggest that Fourche Maline people
held a concept of certain honored dead similar to
the Hopewell core area. Although Fourche Maline
is widely accepted as an ancestral Caddo culture,
its burial mounds are considered unlikely to be the
sole inspiration of the complex Caddo ceremonial centers of Late Prehistoric times (Schambach
2002:110-112).
Woodland Period sites are not formally documented in the project corridor, but Fourche Maline manifestations occur in surrounding areas of
northeast Texas including along the Red, Sulphur,
and Cypress drainage basins, with the Sabine
River forming its approximate southern margin
(Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Fields 2004; Perttula
2004b; Perttula and Nathan 1989). Fourche Maline investigations on the Sulphur River have included the Snipes [41CP8] site along its eastern
lower reach, but are better represented at Cooper

Lake at its upper reaches, where the Tick [41DT6],
Spike [41DT16], Hurricane Hill [41HP106] and an
unnamed site [41HP137] have all been examined.
The Herman Bellew site [41RK222] in the middle Sabine also has been excavated, and several
components have been identified at the Bracheen
[X41RA20], Howle [X41WD19], and Osborn
[X41WD16] site on Lake Fork Reservoir within
the upper Sabine valley, directly south of Cooper
Lake.
Woodland sites occur in both upland and alluvial valley settings, and most contain the signature
middens, hearths or other rock features, earthen
pits, dart or arrow points, and variable amounts of
plain pottery. Fourche Maline burial mounds have
not been identified in northeast Texas, although the
Ralph McKinney mound site [16CD52] lies very
close to the border in Caddo Parish, northwest Louisiana. Formal established cemeteries with flexed,
bundle, and cremation burials are documented at
the Sulphur valley upland site of Hurricane Hill
and also at the Snipes site. The Tick and Spike
sites also yielded abundant faunal remains such as
deer, small mammals, turtles, mussels and, in the
case of Spike, a small amount of bison bone. Remains of hickory nuts, acorns, and vetch also were
recovered (Fields 2004:351-352). Site 41HP137,
in an upland setting near the Hurricane Hill site, is
of considerable interest because of an early Woodland component that contained what are believed
to be fragments of cultivated squash (McGregor
1996). Thurmond (1990: Figure 11) identifies
twenty-four Woodland components in the Cypress
Creek basin, most clustered in the middle and upper
reaches, but nearly all are classified as “limited use
areas” as opposed to settlements. The three sites
classified as settlements (41TT192, 41TT194, and
41HS27) are all partially or completely destroyed.
According to Bruseth (1998:53), only later
manifestations (ca. A.D. 1-900) of Fourche Maline cultural components are present in the middle
Red River Valley. The Mahaffey Site [34CH1] on
the Kiamichi River in Oklahoma is near the western terminus of known site distributions in that
state, and is attributed by Bruseth to the Middle
sub-period. A cemetery of forty-seven semi-flexed
and flexed individuals, interred with a few grave
goods, is a notable aspect of the manifestation.
Like the sites of Deaton [34PU82] and Burroughs

Chapter III: Cultural Setting
[34CH43] in the same drainage, the Mahaffey site
lacks evidence for permanent structures (Perino
and Bennett 1978; Wyckoff and Brooks 1983:91).
Schambach (2001:37), however, has questioned
whether sufficient stratigraphic integrity exists at
the site to permit accurate dating of the assemblage
and its burials. There appears to be consensus that
the Ray Site [41LR135], which lies opposite the
Mahaffey site on the Texas side of the Red River,
represents a very late or transitional Fourche Maline-Caddo, occupation. Excavations in 1991 and
1992 yielded evidence of permanent structures in
the form of numerous postholes, and a pit feature
containing numerous fragments of maize (Perttula
et al. 2001:197-213). Another transitional component containing maize is recognized at the George
C. Davis site in the Neches drainage at the southwest edge of the Fourche Maline distribution. Remains include cobs, stalk fragments and thousands
of cupules (Ford 1997).
Imports and copies of sophisticated decorated
ceramics that were produced by the Tchefuncte,
Marksville, and Coles Creek Woodland groups
of the Lower Mississippi Valley in Louisiana
are sometimes found on northeast Texas archeological sites (Schambach 2001:29-30; Perttula
2004b:376). Although some kind of contact—
direct or indirect—was therefore occurring with
these cultures, Perttula (2004b:377) characterizes
northeast Texas as sparsely settled during this time
and perhaps somewhat outside the sphere of “more
complexly organized local groups.” He maintains
that Woodland occupants of the study region were
“still primarily hunter-gatherers who lived in increasingly larger groups and resided for longer periods of time at certain sites.”

is an acknowledged ancestral culture, other broad
similarities are seen with assemblages from the
Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley to the east
and northeast. Civic and ceremonial mound complexes that administered satellite settlements, extensive trade networks, maize cultivation, and a
hierarchical social structure manifested through
unequal demonstrations of wealth objects in burials, are some of the shared cultural features with
the Mississippi cultures (Bruseth 1998; Perttula
and Bruseth 1998; Wyckoff and Hofman 1983).
Previous culture constructs for the Red River
basin and northeast Texas were devised to fit within the bipartite Gibson (early) and Fulton (late)
aspects of the Caddo Tradition, each with attendant specialized phases that were largely defined
by site-specific investigations (Bell and Baerreis
1951; Davis 1970; Krieger 1946). Multiple culture
units such as Sanders, Bryan, Nelson (in the Red
River) and Alto (in the Pineywoods ecotone) have
for the most part fallen out of use. The Sanders
phase has recently been applied by Bruseth (1998)
despite arguments that its type site is unique in
the region (Schambach 2000a, 2000b). A five-part
Caddo culture sequence (Caddo I-V) advanced by
Davis (1970:40-56) is now favored in the region,
and is interchangeable with the previous Formative
(ca. A.D. 800-1000), Early (ca. A.D. 1000-1200),
Middle (ca. A.D. 1200-1400), Late (ca. A.D. 14001680), and Historic (A.D. 1680-1860) Caddo Periods. The Late Caddo Period corresponds to the
Protohistoric Period, and is discussed separately
below.
In the Pineywoods physiographic province,
Formative through Middle Caddo Periods represent the culmination and fluorescence of a society largely manifested as farmsteads and hamlets.
These sparse settlements are interspersed with a
few large religious and civic mound centers such
as the sites at Hudnall-Pirtle [41RK4], George C.
Davis [41CE19], and Oak Hill Village [41RK214],
with over 40 structures documented at the latter
site (Newell and Krieger 2000; Perttula 1995;
Perttula and Rogers 2007). Sites of all types tend
to be located on well-drained soils within the major river valleys and the tributaries that fed them.
Smaller sites are well documented within the Cypress Creek and Sulphur River basins, including a
series of Early Caddo occupations found at Cooper

Late Prehistoric Period
The bulk of the project corridor lies directly
within the Late Prehistoric Caddo Tradition culture area (ca. 1400-600 B.P. or A.D. 800-1400),
yet extends far enough west that influences of contemporary Plains Village groups to the west and
north may also be considered. The Caddo Tradition is recognized as a fully sedentary society that
comprised a number of polities occupying the
Trans-Mississippi South ecotone, that is, southeast
Oklahoma, northeast Texas, northwest Louisiana,
and southwest Arkansas. While Fourche Maline

Lake which overlay Woodland Period components
(e.g., the Tick, Spike, and Hurricane Hill sites mentioned above). Caddo site assemblages typically
consist of refuse middens, hearths, pits, and postholes of rectangular and circular structures (Fields
2004:355; Perttula and Nathan 1989:22-23). Burials occur in household cemeteries associated with
small settlements and in mounds of some larger
complexes where grave goods attest to differential
social status.
The George C. Davis site on the Neches River is notable for its Formative and Early Caddo
village and mound complex, and was the subject
of sporadic excavations after 1939 (Newell and
Krieger 2000). The complex contains two ceremonial platform mounds and one meticulously layered burial mound that held a succession of shaft
burials, some richly accoutered with artifacts. By
contrast, non-mound burials on the site had few
to no offerings (Story 1998). The George C. Davis site is thought to have functioned as a regional
center for small hamlets until approximately A.D.
1200, when formal mortuary practices appear to
diminish. The Early through Middle Caddoan Oak
Hill Village site in the middle Sabine basin is interpreted by Perttula and Rogers (2007) as marking
the development of a different cultural landscape
within the Caddoan interaction sphere. Its earliest phase consists of a small cluster of houses, the
type of settlement that might be satellite to a larger
center such as George C. Davis or nearby HudnallPirtle. A larger community (estimated to be 74 to
95 people) evolved during its later phases, surrounding a central plaza with a (non-burial) mound
that covered a special-purpose building. A social
de-emphasis of elite ceremonialism has been posited, and the site is thought to be one of a “series
of new, related, but socially independent farming
communities across much of the Pineywoods; the
Oak Hill Village was a nexus for one of those communities” (Perttula and Rogers 2007:91). Stylistic
variations in ceramic assemblages of the region
are thought to represent these distinct local communities (Perttula and Rogers 2007: Figure 12).
Formative to Middle Caddoan material assemblages in northeast Texas include ceramic vessels in an array of utilitarian and special-use forms,
sometimes elaborately decorated with incised,
punctuated, engraved, and impressed designs and

colored clay slips. The wide variety of Formative
and Early Caddoan ceramic types include Holly
Fine Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro
Engraved, Davis Incised, Pennington PunctatedIncised, Coles Creek Incised, and Crockett Curvilinear Incised. In the Red River Valley, the engraved wares occur most often in burial contexts
(Bruseth 1998:55). Middle Caddoan ceramic types
include Canton Incised, Haley Engraved, Sanders
Engraved, and Maxey Noded Redware. Earspools,
figurines, beads, and pipes were also made of clay,
and objects fashioned from bone and shell are
found at some sites where preservation allowed,
including fishhooks, pins, awls, and a variety of
other tools. Lithic assemblages include small, wellcrafted arrow points, although dart points occur in
sufficient numbers to also indicate the concurrent
use of the atlatl spear thrower. (Newell and Krieger 2000:146-151, 216-217; Perttula 2004b:378393). Faunal and floral evidence suggests a mixed
diet within the earlier Caddoan communities, with
remains of deer, rabbits, turtles, and mussels being especially common, and fish, birds, and amphibians also represented. Continued dependence
on wild plant foods is apparent, including acorns,
pecans, sunflower, and a variety of other seeds.
Cultigens such as maize and squash, however,
are present in small quantities, although a strong
emphasis on maize cultivation is not evident until
after A.D. 1300 (Fields 2004:355-356; Newell and
Krieger 2000:182; Perttula 1995:337).
Though its archeology is often treated in tandem with that of the northeast Texas Pineywoods
region, the study over the years of Caddoan sites to
the north and south sides of the Red River Valley
has led to an independent archeological sequence.
Bruseth (1998), for example, upholds the use of
geographically defined culture units such as the
Sanders phase (which spans the Early and Middle
Caddo Periods) and the McCurtain phase (equivalent to the Late Caddo, or Protohistoric Period).
Clusters of sites are identified along southeastern
Oklahoma tributaries such as the Kiamichi and
Little Rivers, with a few noted in the Texas Sulphur River basin. The Formative Caddo Period remains poorly defined without sufficient information to characterize settlement patterns.
Two mortuary sites are known on the Texas
side of the Red River at Bentsen-Clark [41RR41]

Chapter III: Cultural Setting
and Holdeman [41RR11], neither of which is associated with mounds. The former site contained
shaft graves of a several high-status individuals
based on the types of grave goods recovered, while
the latter site held three cemeteries with fiftyeight burials and modest grave furniture (Bruseth
1998:55-58). A single mound complex at the A.C.
Mackin site in Lamar County [41LR36] is firmly
dated to this period, but like the Oak Hill Village
site, neither of the two mounds appears to have
functioned as burial areas. Modal settlement in the
Sanders phase is generally similar to that of northeast Texas, with farmsteads and small hamlets the
most common settlement types on tributaries, and
larger community mound centers such as the sites
at Harling [41FN1], Sanders [41LR2], Roitsch
[41RR16], and the later components at Holdeman
and A.C. Mackin being concentrated on the Red
River and always near well-drained soils that were
suitable for cultivation (Perttula et al. 2001:167168). The investigated mounds were not used for
elite burial, but in all cases were built over structures that had first been burned. Based on these
data, Bruseth (1998:63) proposes the development
of more numerous and independent, civic-oriented
polities within the Red River basin, similar to the
model proposed for the Pineywoods at this time.
The relationship of small settlements to the larger
centers remains poorly understood, in large part
because of a lack of chronometric dates from secure archeological contexts (Wyckoff and Brooks
1983:92-93; Rohn 1998). Sites of the McCurtain
phase are an exception to this rule as reliable radiocarbon dates have been obtained for this Late
Caddoan Period culture (Bruseth 1998; Wyckoff
1970:111-112).
One core area of the Plains Village Tradition
is located in the Washita River basin northwest of
the project area. It is represented by the successive Paoli (ca. A.D. 900-1250) and Washita (ca.
A.D. 1250-1450) Phases. These cultures appear to
emphasize maize horticulture some 300 years earlier than other Caddoan groups in northeast Texas.
Sedentism, noted through excavated features that
represent permanent structures, hamlets, and small
villages is also evident, with notably greater sized
villages in the later Washita phase (Drass 1997).
The village sites tended to favor major drainages
with floodplains suitable for planting, although a

mixed economy is still indicated through the identification of wild plant foods and a diet strongly
supplemented by hunting of large and small mammals, waterfowl, fish, and collection of mussels.
The prevalence of bison bone in faunal assemblages and in tool production suggests these animals
were once again numerous on the Plains (Dillehay
1974). Their return has been linked to a warming trend during this period that culminated in
drought conditions around A.D. 1200 (Hofman et
al. 1989:165). The long dry spell was likely a factor in riverine settlement locations, which in turn
may have fostered experimentation in horticulture
(Brooks 1989:90).
Excavations at the Paoli Phase Pruitt
[34MR12], Brewer [34ML3], and Currie [34GV22]
sites have produced remains of houses, numerous
storage or refuse pits, and hearths. Artifact assemblages include thick-walled cordmarked pottery
vessels with bases that are flattened or rounded
for cooking, an array of corner-notched and sidenotched arrow points, and bone tools used for plant
cultivation (Drass 1997:12-14, 161-163). Site
types and settlement patterns of the Washita River
phase are similar, but site densities are greater with
as many as twenty houses being documented at
some villages. Differences in artifact assemblages
include pottery treatment (with smoothed-surface
wares being prevalent) and an abundance of bison bone digging sticks and scapula hoes (Drass
1997:16, 163). Cemeteries often accompany the
village sites, and grave goods that include non-local pottery and shell ornaments suggest trade with
Caddoan groups to the east (Bell 1984a:311-312;
Drass 1998:430-432). Major Washita phase sites
include Arthur [34GV32], Braden [34GV1], and
Grant [34GV2] in Garvin County, all described by
Brooks (1987).
Traditionally identified as a sedentary, maizegrowing Plains Village culture in north-central
Texas, the Henrietta complex, or focus, is recently
described as a cultural “buffer zone” in which an
admixture of western and eastern (Caddoan) cultural traits are present (Martin 1994:188-195). In
his analysis of the Dillard Site [41CO174] on the
Red River, Martin (1994:189) proposes that this
transitional zone encompassed the middle portion
of the Red River valley, including a section of the
project corridor. Ultimately, Martin finds that sites

in this region share clear affinities with Plains cultures such as the Washita River phase to the north
in Oklahoma, and are likely descendant from local Archaic groups. This advances from an earlier
hypothesis of Bell [1961:55-56] that a relationship
existed between Henrietta and Washita River cultures, although he posited a later migration of Caddoan groups to account for the presence of these
artifacts.
The absence of ceremonial or burial mound
complexes, minimal differentiation in grave
goods, and the occurrence of cordmarked pottery
and Plains-style arrow point assemblages, certainly suggest western Plains influences in these communities’ social development. A greater representation of deer remains over bison is attributed to
the dissected valley landscape which is unsuitable
for herd grazing. Nevertheless, Caddoan trade and
Caddo-like objects such as marine shell ornaments,
pipes, pottery, and lithic materials also frequently
occur at these sites and shared ideas or trade may
also be manifested through apparent similarities
in house construction (Martin 1994:108-111, 188195). Assemblages notable for both Plains Village
and Caddo elements are similarly observed on the
Oklahoma side of the Red River at Haley’s Point
[34MA15] in Marshall County (Rohn 1998) and
the James [34BR11] and Marrs [34BR18] sites
in Bryan County (Wyckoff and Brooks 1983:79).
Wyckoff (1970:116) long ago observed that sites
of the (then) Bryan focus on Lake Texoma showed
more affinities with Plains cultures and could not
“be considered as integral to the Caddoan Tradition.” None of these sites contain mounds or the
quantity of material wealth associated with the
“core” Caddo area. Numerous mound sites (both
ceremonial and midden accumulations) are documented further east along the Red River, including
Sam Kaufman/Roitsch [X41RR1] of the McCurtain phase, Sanders [41LR2], and Harling-Morgan
[41FN1]. The latter mound, in Fannin County, is
the most westerly of these Caddo edifices.
Site records on file at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory indicate that 36 sites dating
to the Late Prehistoric or Caddo Period have been
documented near the Gulf Crossing Project pipeline corridor, and an additional three sites probably
fall within this temporal range. Apart from several

sites discovered during shovel testing and one excavated mound [Harling-Morgan, 41FN1]; all of
the resources are recorded as surface manifestations. Most (n=26) are located in the White Oak
Creek branch of the Sulphur River basin, with a
few being situated in other portions of the same
basin (n=8), four sites located in the Cypress Creek
basin, and one along the Red River. Apart from
Harling-Morgan, only one site is firmly assigned
to a sub-period, and it is a protohistoric cemetery
that is discussed in the following section. Three
other small sites may also date to the Late Caddo
Period while a single camp or hamlet at 41CS150
is tentatively assigned to the Early Caddo Period.
A variety of site types appear to be represented, including open campsites, farmsteads, hamlets,
villages, mounds, and a cemetery. Camp sites are
most common (n=26), but where assemblages
consist entirely of lithics and ceramic sherds, or
structural remains are not visible (which is most
of the time), it is often difficult for investigators to
distinguish between camps, farmsteads, or small
settlements, and this problem is usually acknowledged in the records. Given the classification and
chronological limitations, it is not yet possible to
examine settlement hierarchies in any detailed
way, although some sites provide more information than others. For instance, 41CS141, 41MX13,
41TT31, 41TT76, and 41TT83 all contain either
midden deposits with bone, shell, and artifacts, or
structural remains such as daub, that indicate more
continuing or permanent occupations. A cemetery
of unspecified Late Prehistoric date was reported
at 41TT64, but the burials have apparently been
repeatedly looted and effectively destroyed. Three
mound sites are documented, including a single
small construction at 41MX29 that is associated
with a few artifacts, and a series of three mounds at
the Dawson Lake Mounds site [41RR200], which
is also undated. The Sanders Phase Harling-Morgan mound, discussed earlier, was excavated by E.
Mott Davis in 1960, and subsequently destroyed by
agricultural development (Davis 1962a). Mounds
in the project area are exclusively situated in floodplain settings. Open camps/small settlements range
over a variety of landforms, including low terraces
or natural levees on valley floors, uplands, and,
most often, ridges and terraces of valley slopes.

Chapter III: Cultural Setting
Protohistoric Period
Definitions and chronologies vary widely,
but the Protohistoric Period in northeast Texas (ca.
700-300 B.P. or A.D. 1300-1700) overlaps with
the initial Spanish entrada of De Soto and Moscoso into east Texas from the Mississippi Valley
in 1542. It continues with the subsequent French
explorations of the region in the eighteenth century, and culminates in regular, sustained European contact in the following Historic Period. Many
scholars recognize, however, that indigenous cultures prior to the time of contact were undergoing significant changes worthy of distinction from
Late Prehistoric trends and the arrival of Europeans
(Brooks and Drass 1984:33; Davis 1970:52; Hofman 1989b:91; Perttula and Rogers 2007:91-91).
Relative to Late Prehistoric site densities, for instance, depopulation is indicated by smaller number of Plains sites that date to this period in central
and western Oklahoma, although coalescence into
fewer, larger settlements may be responsible for
the pattern (Baugh 1986; Drass 1997). Until its
demise, reorganization, more than depopulation,
appears to characterize the Protohistoric (or Late
Caddoan) Titus Phase of northeast Texas, which
is situated between the Sabine and Sulphur Rivers and which dated from ca. A.D. 1430 to 1680.
Perttula (1995, 2004b) proposes a continuation of
sociopolitical and economic trends outlined for the
Middle Caddo Period in the region. He believes it
extended too much of the Late Caddoan sphere of
influence and included the decreasing importance
of large mound ceremonial centers and a de-centralized social hierarchy in favor of autonomous,
egalitarian communities. One suggested impetus
for these changes is rooted in maize surpluses,
which encouraged self-sufficiency at the local
level and rendered elite control over production
obsolete. Expanding on Thurmond’s (1985, 1990)
observations, Perttula points to the identification
of distinct settlement subgroups within archeological regions that may reflect tribal integration or
coalescence (Perttula 1995:352; 2004b:396-398,
406-407). Because Titus phase settlements are
highly dispersed and frequently occur on minor
streams, they are characterized as rural communities (Pertulla 2004b:398). The fate of the Titus
communities is closely tied to the Spanish entrada,
for by A.D. 1550 large cemeteries serving multiple

communities appear within the Cypress Creek basin, and within 100 years of European contact the
region is largely abandoned. The effects of introduced epidemic disease such as smallpox, though
not expressly identified in skeletal pathology (Derrick and Wilson 2001), are strongly suspected.
Ethnographically documented Caddo groups at
this time include confederacies of the Hasinai in
east Texas to the south, and the Kadahadacho to
the northeast in the Great Bend area. It is possible
that Late Caddoan Titus Phase survivors were incorporated into these groups (Perttula 1998:8485).
The Late Caddo or Protohistoric Period also
is represented by sites of the McCurtain Phase (ca.
A.D. 1300-1700), which occur along both sides of
the Red River in southeast Oklahoma and northeast Texas. It is closely associated with the adjacent
Texarkana Phase, which is focused along the Great
Bend of southwest Arkansas and which extends
southwest into Texas, including a small portion
of the lower Sulphur River drainage (Schambach
1983). These cultures predate the Titus Phase by
approximately 100 years, and in their early horizons exhibit settlement patterns not unlike earlier
groups in northeast Texas; i.e., with modest farms
and hamlets forming satellites in the landscape to
larger mound centers on the Red River. Small Texarkana Phase localities on the Sulphur River such
as Knights Bluff site were probably outliers to centers such as at Hatchel Mound [41BW3]. Mounds
continue to be built early in the McCurtain phase,
albeit on a small scale. Relative to Sanders phase
site distributions, Bruseth (1998:60-61) notes a contraction of settlement toward the east. The smaller
settlements that were presumably integrated by the
larger ceremonial centers are more numerous on the
Oklahoma side of the Red River. At least initially,
people of both phases appear to have relied heavily on maize, maintained well-defined social hierarchies, and had broad ceramic repertoires, with
Nash Neck Banded, Emory Punctated-Incised,
Simms Engraved, and Avery Engraved among the
common decorated types recognized in excavated
assemblages (Pertulla et al. 2001:168, 182).
In his summary of the McCurtain Phase,
Bruseth (1998) interprets a more condensed settlement pattern than is evident in the Titus Phase,
likening it to the Téran-Soule model proposed by
27

R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

Chapter III: Cultural Setting
Schambach (1983) for the Great Bend region. This
model is based on a map drawn in 1691 by don Domingo Téran de los Rios of a Kadohadacho village,
which illustrates an extended settlement that was
composed of distinct compounds, each containing
one or two houses, and a single ceremonial mound
at the west end. One of the compounds housed the
Caddí, or tribal chief. The title is ethnographically
significant, because it is understood to describe a
leader of limited authority, who led by example
rather than force (Griffith 1954:64). The Téran de
los Rios map is thought to depict the Texarkana
Phase site of Hatchel Mound (Perttula and Nathan
1989:25). Mounds are not frequently built later in
the McCurtain phase (after A.D. 1500), and appear
instead to be supplanted by household cemeteries.
Bruseth (1998:60-64) thus associates “a decline in
social and political complexity” with this culture.
Periodic excavations at the Sam Kaufman/
Roitsch site in Red River County, Texas, have
yielded a substantial McCurtain component (Harris 1953; Skinner, Harris, and Anderson 1969;
Perttula et al. 2001). Investigations have focused
on the remains of two mounds and a surrounding
village, although Skinner, Harris, and Anderson
(1969:1) note that the mound complex appears to
include the west end of “an extended village area”
that can be seen through middens extending a mile
to the east. Recent work at one of the mounds revealed that it covered a subterranean tomb shaft in
its floor, a feature also found at other early McCurtain phase sites (see Wyckoff 1970:112). The other
mound is composed of layers of burned buildings,
and is interpreted as a destroyed temple platform.
Bruseth (1998:62) suggests that the McCurtain
Phase ended before A.D. 1700, in part because
ceramic assemblages usually associated with Historic Caddo occupations are rare, as are European
trade artifacts (though these are not absent; see
Skinner, Harris, and Anderson [1969:10]). In his
study of the middle Red River valley, Perttula et
al. (2001:168) attributes depopulation factors to
epidemic diseases introduced by Europeans, and
to raiding from the north by Osage tribesmen.
West of the McCurtain culture area, the
Wichita and affiliated tribes are recognized as the
principal inhabitants of north-central Texas and

south-central Oklahoma. Both practiced agriculture but also hunted extensively. It is possible that
this latter subsistence pattern was affected by intrusive trade regimes incurred by French regional desires for animal products (Bell 1984b:371;
Drass 1998:445-446; Rohrbaugh 1982:51-53).
The Longest Site [34JF1], located on the Red
River in Jefferson County, was a very large fortified village with houses, middens, burials, and
storage pits dated to the mid-1700s; it is thought
to possibly be the Taovayas stronghold that was
attacked by the Spanish in 1759 (Bell and Bastian
1967). Other evidence of signature European trade
goods is present at the Longest site and a few other
excavated Protohistoric sites in the Prairie-Plains.
Specifically the items recovered include metal tinklers, glass beads, gun parts, iron nails, iron kettle
fragments (used to make metal arrow points), and
metal ornaments (Bell 1984b: 370-377).
The Sam Kaufman/Roitsch mound site discussed above reportedly contained a minor component dated to the Historic Caddo Period with
similar materials (Skinner, Harris, and Anderson
1969:10), although later excavations of the area
indicated did not yield evidence dating to this time
(Perttula et al. 2001:183-186). The Womack Engraved ceramic type of Wichita manufacture, present at two sites in the Lake Fork Reservoir, also
does not convince Bruseth and Perttula (1981:6)
that the occupations are not residual Caddo. The
single site firmly assigned to the Protohistoric Period in the Gulf Crossing Project region is a Titus
phase cemetery [41TT643] that is situated in the
White Oak Creek drainage (TARL Site Form).
Three cemetery localities were recognized through
the landowner’s collection of 100 ceramic vessels
from thirty-four burials. Two of the areas reportedly yielded arrow points and Titus Phase ceramic
types, including Ripley Engraved and Taylor Engraved, as well as effigy bowls. The third cemetery
area contained later burials interred with items such
as copper tinklers, beads, metal arrow points, and
ceramic vessels identified as Womack Engraved.
The question remains, however, whether this and
similar artifact assemblages in the region represent
occupations from the Caddo or Wichita groups, or
even an admixture of both communities.

HISTORY

I

ntroduction
The currently proposed pipeline right-ofway consists of two segments that cross
through northeastern Texas. The westernmost
section of the proposed pipeline route extends for
approximately 6.4 km (4 mi) through northeastern Grayson County and northwesternmost Fannin County, crossing the Red River into Bryan
County, Oklahoma, about 1.4 km (0.9 mi) above
the junction of Choctaw Creek and the Red River. The eastern section of the proposed pipeline
route re-enters Fannin County, Texas, crossing
the Red River less than 1 km (0.6 mi) downriver
from its confluence with Bryan County, Oklahoma’s Blue River. From northeastern Fannin
County, the proposed pipeline follows a path that
traverses Lamar, Delta, and Hopkins Counties,
just skirting southwesternmost Red River County
before continuing southeastward through Franklin, Titus, Morris, and Cass Counties and ending
at the Texas/Louisiana state line. The proposed
Gulf Crossing does not enter Red River County
directly, however a now-abandoned route was
surveyed for cultural resources and did traverse
through several miles of that county (Appendix
I). The background information relating to Red
River County that is presented here is only relevant to that abandoned route.
En route to its terminus, the proposed pipeline route passes near numerous small towns
and communities; however, the study area has
remained primarily rural and sparsely populated
since earliest settlement. Historically, this region has been connected to activities along the
Red and Sulphur Rivers. This chapter presents
a general overview of the history of the project
counties from the historic settlement of the region
forward, with emphasis placed on the area that
encompasses the proposed pipeline corridor.

Exploration and Colonization
Spain was the first European nation to declare sovereignty over the Texas region. In 1519,
the governor of Jamaica sent Alonso Álvarez de
Pineda to find a passage linking the Gulf of Mexico with the Pacific Ocean. De Pineda sailed along
the Gulf Coast from Cape Florida to Mexico,
claiming possession of all associated territory for
the Spanish Crown. Other Spanish explorations
soon followed: Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and
his three fellow survivors of the ill-fated Pánfilo
de Narváez expedition (1528-1536); Francisco
Vásquez de Coronado (1540-1542); and Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado, who led the Hernando de
Soto expedition through eastern Texas (1542)
following the death of its leader in mid-1542.
Of these expeditions, only the de Soto/Moscoso
route brought the Spanish near the vicinity of the
proposed project corridor (Figure 4.1) (Chipman
1992:22-42; Clark 1939:4-9; Hudson 1994:7677, 94-98).
After participating in the Spanish conquest of
Central and South America, Hernando de Soto and
his men sought precious metals in “La Florida,”
which on contemporary Spanish maps encompassed most of the North American continent. In the
spring of 1539, the company of “over 600 soldiers,
twelve priests, two women, servants and slaves,
223 horses, numerous mules and war dogs, and
a herd of swine” sailed from Cuba to Tampa Bay
in present-day Florida (Gannon 1996:26). De Soto
then led his expedition across southeastern America, crossing the Mississippi River near the present
Tennessee/Mississippi state border and into northeastern Arkansas in mid-June 1541. The Spaniards
explored the Arkansas region for nearly a year before returning to the Mississippi River, probably in
the southeastern Arkansas vicinity, where de Soto
became ill with a fever and died on May 21, 1542.

Spanish Texas, 1519-1821 (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1992)” (Gournay 1995:6). Adapted text figure
depicts the general routes of sixteenth century Spanish explorers through Texas. It should be noted that these
routes are generalized and, consequently, inexact depictions, and they do not reflect the most recent studies.

Sources disagree on the location of the Red River
crossing – from northwestern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas, or from southeastern Oklahoma; however, the most recent studies place the
probable Moscoso route through several presentday counties of northeastern Texas, including the
project counties of Cass, Morris, Titus, Franklin,
and Red River (with county variations according to study, of course). One of the most recently
proposed reconstructions (Bruseth and Kenmotsu
1993) offers two alternate routes crossing the Red
River into Texas from southeastern Oklahoma. The
eastern path extends southward through Bowie and

Luis de Moscoso Alvarado took command of the
expedition survivors, and he led them westward
into eastern Texas in an unsuccessful overland
attempt to reach the settlements in New Spain
(present-day Mexico). The expedition, about half
its original size, eventually returned to the Mississippi River and traveled downriver, then across the
Gulf of Mexico to the Vera Cruz district, reaching
that destination on September 10, 1543 (Chipman
1992:39-41; Hudson 1994:75-99).
Various studies indicate that the Moscoso expedition probably passed through the current project vicinity during the summer and fall of 1542.

Cass Counties en route to the Sabine River, and
the western course traverses Red River and Titus
Counties toward the same Sabine crossing. Both of
these proposed routes cross the current project corridor (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993:199-218; Chipman 1992:31, 40; Hudson 1994:76-77, 95-98).
The rulers of the Spanish empire deemed the
de Soto/Moscoso expedition inconsequential. They
concluded that it merely demonstrated the absence
of gold and other treasures in the region. For the
Native Americans, however, the de Soto expedition brought severe consequences. The Spaniards
not only treated the indigenous people ruthlessly,
but they also introduced diseases to which they had
no immunity. According to one scholarly estimate,
disease reduced the Native American population
by 80 percent. This tragic phenomenon almost
certainly was a major factor in the decline of the
Caddo along the Red River through northeastern
Texas and southeastern Oklahoma. The Caddo had
inhabited this region for centuries prior to historic
contact. More specifically, the homeland of the Kadohadacho Confederacy, an alliance of four Caddoan groups, was situated in northeastern Texas
and southwestern Arkansas, primarily between the
Red River and the Sulphur River (inclusive of most
of the current project corridor). By the early nineteenth century, disease and hostile Native American
transient groups had forced the surviving Caddo to
abandon their once numerous Red River villages
and to consolidate with related groups in locations
removed from their traditional domain (Bruseth
and Kenmotsu 1993:218-219; Chipman 1992:17;
McLemore 1973:101-102; Texas State Historical
Association 2001-2006a).
Spain took no further action to strengthen her
claim to the Texas region, leaving the area undisturbed by Europeans for over 140 years. Next to
explore the locale was a French colonizing expedition under the leadership of Réné Robert Cavalier,
Sieur de la Salle, a follow-up to his triumphant
claim of the Mississippi River Basin for France in
1682. On February 20, 1685, a navigational error
brought the La Salle party to Matagorda Bay along
the Texas Gulf Coast, rather than to the mouth of
the Mississippi River. The colonization attempt
proved disastrous. Dissension, defections, supply
losses, sickness, malnutrition, Native American
troubles, and, finally, massacre conspired against

the French colonists, ending the colonization effort in late 1688 (Campbell 2003:41-45; Fehrenbach 1991:37-41; Weddle 2002).
Although a calamitous failure, the La Salle
colony proved to be of great significance to Texas history. The French settlement gave France a
claim to Texas, but it also rekindled Spanish interest in the region, giving rise to further exploration and occupation. In addition, the intent of
the La Salle expedition to establish a Louisiana
colony gave the United States reason to claim
a portion of Texas as part of the Louisiana Purchase (1803), initiating boundary disputes that
continued until settled by the Adams-Onís Treaty
in 1819 (Campbell 2003:45-46; Clark 1939:30;
Weddle 2002).
Both the Spanish and French continued
their explorations of present-day Texas; however,
most of these ventures were concentrated along
the Texas Gulf Coast. The project region also was
bypassed by the Franciscan missionary efforts
advanced by the Spanish colonial government
from the late seventeenth century through the
late eighteenth century. Still, by the early eighteenth century, significant trading activities were
in place between Europeans and the Caddo of
the northeastern Texas Red River country (Chipman 1992:17, 80-94, 105-109, 147-149; Wright
2002).
In 1719, the Company of the Indies, proprietor of the French Louisiana colony, granted
Bénard de La Harpe a concession within the Kadohadacho district, where he was instructed to expand French trade with the Spaniards and Native
Americans of the region. Learning that the Spanish
colonial government intended to establish a settlement within the same locale, La Harpe traveled up
the Red and Bear [Sulphur] Rivers to meet with the
Upper Nasoni chief and other Caddoan leaders. As
part of his concession, La Harpe built a stockaded
post along the south bank of the Red River in present-day Bowie County (probably the Roseborough
Lake site situated northwest of Texarkana), not far
from the south side home of the Nasoni chief, but
across the river from the main Upper Nasoni village
in present-day southwestern Arkansas. Although
garrisoned by a small detachment transferred from
Fort St. Jean Baptiste (Natchitoches, Louisiana),
Le Poste des Cadodaquious (also known as the
31

R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

Chapter IV: History
Nassonite Post and Fort Breton, among other name
variations) served principally as a trading station
and supply base. Its chief military significance was
as a deterrent to the northward expansion of the
Spanish. La Harpe was succeeded as commander
by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis in late 1719. A
number of French expeditions and trading ventures
were launched from or supplied by this post, and
some probably passed through the current project
vicinity (Britton 2001a; Carter 1995:15, 143-150,
373, 383; Johnson 2002).
Both the French and the Spanish colonial
governments claimed the northeastern Texas Red
River country through much of the eighteenth century. The boundary between French and Spanish
possessions long remained ill-defined, due either
to ignorance of the area geography or to a lackadaisical attitude toward this undeveloped region.
France claimed that the Louisiana colony extended westward to the Brazos and Trinity Rivers
(as far west as the Rio Grande, according to some
sources), while Spain declared that its Texas territory extended eastward into Louisiana to the Calcasieu River and the Arroyo Hondo, or Rio Hondo.
In fact, the capital of Spanish Texas from 1729 to
1773 was placed at Los Adaes, a Spanish presidio
and mission located less than 24 km (15 mi) west
of Fort St. Jean Baptiste (present-day Natchitoches), the easternmost settlement of the French Louisiana colony. Separated by the Rio Hondo, both
sites today are situated within Natchitoches Parish,
Louisiana (Carter 1995:114, 143-152; Fehrenbach
1991:118; McCorkle 2001).
The French continued to man Poste des Cadodaquious until soon after the Louisiana colony west of the
Mississippi River was ceded to Spain in 1762. The
post apparently continued to serve as a trading base
for several years following the cession. Although
northeastern Texas was under Spanish dominion
at this time, the colonial government continued to
employ the trade and diplomatic services of the
French, who for decades had maintained friendly
relationships with the Native Americans of the region. In 1769, The Spanish colonial governor appointed Frenchman Athanase de Mézières (former
son-in-law to St. Denis and brother-in-law to the
Duc d’Orleans) lieutenant governor of the Natchitoches District. A year later, Mézières traveled to

the Red River region of Texas to begin diplomatic
negotiations with the area Nations. As part of that
first expedition, he temporarily revived the Cadodaquious post as a Spanish garrison, San Luiz de
los Cadodachos; however, the attached population
generally remained the families of the French traders who had worked the region since the founding
of the post. With Caddo population losses due to
disease and Osage hostilities, the remaining French
settlers finally abandoned the post in 1788 (Britton
2001a; Carter 1995:163, 179-188, 213-214; Fehrenbach 1991:70-71).
Some sources suggest that another French
post was established ca. 1752 by trader François Hervey and a small military force. Named
Fort St. Louis de Carloretto (or Carloretta), this
post and attached settlement (which existed until about 1770) reportedly were located either in
northern Red River County or in the southeastern
corner of present-day Lamar County, interpretations vary (with the latter location placed generally southeast of the hamlet of Cunningham and in
the immediate vicinity of the current project corridor). The principal source for this information
appears to have been Texas historian Henderson
K. Yoakum, who in 1855 published an extensive
chronicle of Texas that covered the entire historic
period prior to U.S. annexation in 1846 (Clark
2004:vii-viii; Fort Tour Systems n.d.; Yoakum
1935:125-126). Most of the sources researched
for this project do not include this location, and
one current account (Britton 2001a) indicates that
Fort St. Louis de Carloretto simply is an “American” misidentification of the documented Poste
des Cadodaquious. Unquestionably, François
Hervey was a known trader in the Texas/Oklahoma Red River region; however, the record is
cloudy regarding his establishment of a trading
post and garrison in the area.
Early Nineteenth Century
As discussed previously in this chapter,
there are records of European explorers and traders passing through the Texas Red River country;
however, no permanent settlements were established there until the early nineteenth century.
Euro-American settlers apparently did not arrive
in the region encompassing the project counties

Chapter IV: History
until after the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. Prior
to that time, the area was occupied by Native
Americans, primarily the Caddo, a nation longassociated with northeastern Texas (Texas State
Historical Association 2001-2006a).
The early nineteenth century was a complicated and generally unsettled period for northeastern Texas, both physically and politically. Although the land comprising the present-day state
of Texas was not included within the Louisiana
Purchase of 1803, its eastern border was disputed
for years because of conflicting border claims. The
boundary between French and Spanish possessions
long had been ill-defined, due either to ignorance
of the area geography or to a lackadaisical attitude
toward this undeveloped region. France claimed
that the Louisiana colony extended westward to
the Brazos and Trinity Rivers (as far west as the
Rio Grande, according to some sources), while
Spain declared that its Texas territory extended
eastward into Louisiana to the Calcasieu River
and the Arroyo Hondo, or Rio Hondo. The United
States government accepted the French version of
the boundary while negotiating the Louisiana Purchase. The Spanish response was to strengthen its
garrison at Los Adaes (in present-day Natchitoches
Parish, Louisiana). Following the 1803 purchase,
the United States revised the western boundary
of the Louisiana Territory eastward to the Sabine
River, then took immediate steps to protect that
border and to encourage American settlement in
Louisiana. Spain, in the meantime, continued to
patrol the region eastward to Natchitoches (Chipman 1992:222-226; Clark 1939:69-73; Davis
1971:157-171; Fehrenbach 1991:118).
During these early years of the nineteenth century, various exploratory parties traveled through
the region, recording details of the Red River
country and the disputed Louisiana/Texas boundary. The general intent of these expeditions was
to explore the new western frontier of the United
States, as expanded by the Louisiana Territory.
The leaders of these expeditions included Dr. John
Sibley, who was commissioned in 1803 to report
his observations of the Red River and surrounding
region; surveyor Thomas Freeman and naturalist/
ethnographer Peter Custis, who commenced their
Red River Expedition in the spring of 1806 (an expedition considered second in importance only to

the 1804-1806 Lewis and Clark expedition along
the Missouri River); Zebulon Montgomery Pike,
who explored the territory along the Arkansas and
Red Rivers in 1806-1807; and Anthony Glass, who
led a trading expedition along the Red River July
1808 – May 1809. Pike bypassed the study area
in his unsuccessful quest to find the headwaters
of the Red River; however, Sibley explored the
Red River boundary of northeastern Texas past the
mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek (which enters the Red
River near the present-day Fannin/Lamar County
line) and at least as far west as the Wichita River.
Freeman and Custis attempted a similar route, but
they were intercepted by a Spanish military force
at present-day Spanish Bluff in Bowie County,
Texas, and ordered to return to U.S. territory.
Glass was more successful with his private trading
expedition from Natchitoches, Louisiana, to the
Wichita country of north-central Texas, making
favorable trade contacts with the Native American
groups met during the journey. These expeditions
helped open northeastern Texas to American trade,
and the documentation resulting from the explorations provided significant details of Native American folkways and the natural environment (Carter
1995:223-236; Chipman 1992:223-228; Flores
2001; Sibley 1806:60-67).
The various Red River expeditions encouraged the establishment of trading posts along the
Red River. Pecan Point and Jonesborough (sometimes spelled Jonesboro), located in northeastern
and northwestern Red River County, respectively,
reportedly were the first Anglo-American settlements established in northeastern Texas. First
settled ca. 1811-1815, these early communities
served as trading posts, population centers, and
Red River entrances into Texas. Eventually these
locations were lost to the ever-shifting Red River
course – Pecan Point largely destroyed and Jonesborough left “high and dry” about a mile south of
the river – but both were important places in the
advancement of American settlement in Texas
prior to statehood (Chipman 1992:239; Strickland 2001).
The Adams-Onís Treaty finally settled the
Texas/Louisiana border in 1819, with the transfer from Spain formalized in 1821. The established boundary followed the Sabine River from
the Gulf of Mexico to the 32nd parallel, and then
33

Chapter IV: History
it continued due north to the Red River. There
was considerable confusion, though, over the
points where the 32nd parallel intersected both
the Sabine River and the Red River, a situation
that resulted in the Arkansas Territorial Legislature claiming much of northeastern Texas as part
of Miller County, established on April 1, 1820.
The affected district included all or most of the
following present-day Texas counties – Bowie,
Red River, Lamar, Fannin, Hunt, Delta, Hopkins,
Franklin, Titus, Morris, and Cass – i.e., much
of the current study area. This quandary existed
for a quarter of a century, causing considerable
political disorder. Miller County residents found
themselves, fairly or not, governed both by the
Arkansas Territorial Legislature and by the various Texas governments – Spain, Mexico, and the
Texas Republic. Most county inhabitants actually
regarded themselves as Texians, and some became important figures in the struggle for Texas
independence. It wasn’t until Texas annexation
to the United States in 1845, though, that the
boundary configuration was resolved (Chipman
1992:239-240; Connor 2001; Thorndale and Dollarhide 1987:32-34, 326).
The early nineteenth century brought changes to the Native American populace of the project
region. As previously noted in this chapter, disease and hostile groups of transient Native Americans combined to force the indigenous Caddoan
groups to leave their traditional Red River domain
by the late eighteenth-early nineteenth century.
During the 1820s-1840s, migrating Native American groups briefly occupied the study area. These
transient Native Americans included the Shawnee,
Delaware, Kickapoo, Quapaw, Choctaw, Creek,
and associated groups. The influx of both AngloAmerican settlers and non-indigenous Native
Americans proved a volatile mix, resulting in hostilities and depredations throughout the region that
generally lasted until the 1830s-1840s, when most
of the Native American population abandoned the
area. This migration was due largely to the removal policy enacted in 1839 by Texas Republic President Mirabeau Bonaparte Lamar, whose
orders mandated Native American movement (if
not peaceful, then forced) to the Indian Territory
across the Red River in Oklahoma (Richardson et

al. 2001:138-140; Texas State Historical Association 2001-2006a).
Empresario Grants: Wavell and Cameron
Following political unrest and the resulting
series of revolts during the early nineteenth century, Spain granted independence to Mexico on
August 24, 1821. At that time, Texas was very
sparsely populated. In fact, out of the 6.2 million inhabitants of the Mexican territory, which
at that time extended from Oregon to Guatemala, Texas held only 2,500. Mexican authorities recognized the immediate need to populate
their northern provinces, realizing that settlements in Texas would improve defenses against
hostile Native Americans and would provide a
buffer zone against the expanding United States.
Anglo-American colonists of good character
were welcome, provided they pledged loyalty to
Mexico and to the Catholic Church; however, the
Mexican government particularly encouraged the
immigration of European Catholics and the migration of Mexican citizens to Texas. In order to
facilitate settlement, the empresario system was
established in Texas, whereby designated land
agents, or empresarios, entered into colonization
contracts with the Mexican government. First and
best known of these land contractors were Moses Austin and his son, Stephen F. Austin, whose
Austin Colony was organized during the early
1820s (Barker 2001; Davis 2002:19-24; Fehrenbach 1991:132-151).
The Mexican colonization laws were very
generous. Heads of families were entitled to one
sitio, or square league (4,428 ac [1,792 ha]), of
pasture land and one labor (177 ac [71.6 ha]) of
farming land; unmarried men received a lesser
amount. Land prices began at about $30.00 for
a league of grazing land, and this was payable,
initially tax-free, over a period of six years. Although there were survey, commissioner, clerk,
and empresario fees, a settler still paid only about
$150.00 for a league of land. In addition, immigrants who married Mexican women were granted augmented acreage. With this encouragement,
the Texas population increased to nearly 25,000
settlers by 1834 (Barker 2001; Davis 2002:23,
37; Texas General Land Office 2000).

Chapter IV: History
The territory encompassing much of the project region fell within two large land grants issued
to empresarios during the 1820s. Northeasternmost Texas was located within Wavell’s Colony,
which was established in 1826 by British soldier
of fortune Arthur Goodall Wavell, with Benjamin
Rush Milam acting as his agent. Adjoining the
western boundary of Wavell’s Colony was Cameron’s Grant (1828), the second Texas contract
conveyed to Scotland native and John Cameron;
his first contract was granted in 1827 in central
Texas (Figure 4.2) (McKeehan 2001a, 2002).

Table 4.1

Wavell’s Colony was situated generally between the Red River and the Sulphur Fork of the
Red River [Sulphur River], a region that encompassed all of present-day Bowie and Red River
Counties, most of Lamar County, and may have
spread into neighboring counties (Table 4.1).
The colony grant also extended into southwestern Arkansas. The efforts to recruit British and
American colonists to Wavell’s Colony were hindered by several factors, including the following:
Mexico objected to the introduction of slavery
into the region, the Great Raft (an enormous log

jam located downstream in northwestern Louisiana) obstructed travel along the Red River into
Texas, and the United States rightfully disputed
the colony extension into the Arkansas Territory. Ultimately, only about 140 families settled
in Wavell’s Colony, rather than the anticipated
400-500, and, with Milam’s death (1835), monetary losses, failed compensation petitions, and
other deterrents, Wavell finally gave up his Texas
claims in the mid-1850s to pursue other interests
(Cutrer 2001; Fehrenbach 1991:148; McKeehan
2001a, 2002).
The northern Cameron Grant was located
along the south bank of the Red River, and its territory covered a 20-league wide swathe between
Wavell’s Colony and the Texas Panhandle. This
contract previously was granted in 1827 to Reuben Ross; however, he was murdered by robbers
before he could establish his colony. Included in
the Red River frontage of Cameron’s Grant were
the present-day project counties of Grayson, most
of Fannin, and westernmost Lamar (Table 4.1:
project county development). The Cameron contract was extended, 1832-1835, in order to enable
the introduction of 200 families to the region;
however, his colonization efforts yielded to his
increased participation in revolutionary activities.
Cameron acquired land tracts elsewhere in Texas,
and he eventually moved to the Rio Grande Valley (Kemp 2001a; McKeehan 2001a, 2002; Texas
State Historical Association 2004).
An examination of the headright maps and
land grants of the project counties indicates that
only one land title was granted along the current
project corridor during the empresario period. This
was the Cameron Grant title to 4,428.4 ac (1,792.2
ha) conveyed to José Ramón Bedford on September 5, 1835 – a Red River frontage tract covering
land that straddled the present-day Fannin/Lamar
County line. Bedford was translator and secretary
of the Gonzales Ayuntamiento (governing body)
of 1833, and he apparently also served as a Spanish instructor for English-speaking arrivals to
Mexico. The documents attached to the Bedford
land grant indicate that the transaction proceedings began in 1830-1831 and continued through
1834-1835. According to Ayuntamiento records,
Bedford died in mid-1833; consequently, his Red
River land acquisition probably was completed for

the benefit of his heirs. According to one source,
though, “No titles … were ever issued in consequence of either [Cameron] contract” (Kemp
2001a). This statement apparently holds true for
the Bedford title, as evidenced by the fact that the
official Lamar County map depicts the Bedford
tract overlaid by later-established headrights and
that neither the Fannin County map nor its land
grant database include Bedford within county
bounds (McKeehan 2001b, 2006; Morriss et al.
2003; Texas General Land Office ca. 2006-2007;
Vines and Clark 2003).
The Republic of Texas
On May 9, 1824, a few years after Mexico
gained its independence from Spain in 1821, the
Mexican Congress merged the eastern provinces
of Coahuila and Texas into one political entity, the
State of Coahuila y Texas, with its capital established (inconveniently for the Texian colonists) in
the Mexican interior town of Saltillo (Figure 4.3).
As originally established, the state government
was organized with a single department, Bexar,
representing the province of Texas. In 1831, the
Department of Bexar was subdivided, with the
new Department of Nacogdoches covering the
eastern side of Texas. The departments were subdivided further in 1834; however, the immediate
project vicinity remained part of the Department
of Nacogdoches throughout this period (Figure 4.4). Each department was divided into local districts called municipalities. The proposed
project corridor was encompassed entirely by the
Nacogdoches Municipality until 1835, when the
Tenehaw Municipality was carved from northeasternmost Texas. On January 11, 1836, Texian
representatives of the municipalities changed the
name of Tenehaw to Shelby (Table 4.1: project
county development) (Elliott 2001; Genealogy
Inc. 2006; Stephens and Holmes 1989:21, 24;
Texas State Historical Association 2001a).
The distance between the principal Texian
settlements in central Texas and the Mexican government seats in Saltillo and Mexico City caused
considerable communication and political difficulties within the state. Through the years following the establishment of the State of Coahuila y
Texas, trouble brewed between the Mexican government and the Texian colonists over separate

statehood issues. In October-November 1835,
representatives of the existing municipalities met
at San Felipe de Austin to discuss the problems
created by the Mexican dictatorship. The assembly, commonly referred to as the Consultation,
declared Texas a separate state existing within the
nation of Mexico, but independently ruled by its
own General Council, which was referred to as
the Provisional Government, pending ratification
of a constitution (Barker and Pohl 2001; Gournay
1995:19-23; Stephens and Holmes 1989:21, 24).

Figure 4.5

Shortly following the March 2, 1836, declaration of independence from Mexico, the new
government of the Republic of Texas redesignated most of the Municipality of Nacogdoches
as Nacogdoches County. Adjoining Red River
County was created from the northeasternmost
section of the Nacogdoches Municipality and
the northern part of the Tenehaw/Shelby Municipality. Together, these two Republic-designated
counties encompassed all of the territory that
would become the current project counties (Fig-

County and was officially organized on February

(Genealogy Inc. 2006; Ludeman 2001).
Northeastern Texas was far removed from
the military actions of the Texas Revolution and
later border troubles; however, the locale was traversed by troops, traders, and travelers throughout
the Republic period. Jonesborough and Coffee’s
Station in present-day Red River and Grayson
Counties, respectively, were principal points of
entry from the Red River into the Texas interior
(Britton 2001b; Strickland 2001). Several military
and trading expeditions traveled through northeastern Texas during the Republic years. These
campaigns included General Thomas Jefferson

Native Americans during the Córdova Rebellion (1838-1839) and subsequent Cherokee War
(1839), related events involving hostilities toward

Although Red River County was established
as one of the original Republic counties, it was
not delineated formally until December 14, 1837,
when its “vaguely defined area” was divided into
Fannin and Red River Counties, occupying the
west and east sections of the district, respectively
(Harper 2006a). The name Red River obviously
was derived from the northern boundary of the
county. Fannin County, which initially included
part of the Republic County of Nacogdoches,
originally was to be called Independence County;
however, during legislative debates, the name
was changed to honor Colonel James Walker
Fannin, Jr., a “martyred hero of the Texas Revolution” who was executed in the Goliad Massacre
of March 27, 1836 (Pigott 2006). The only other
project county established during the Republic
years was Lamar County, which was created on

the new Texas Republic (Figure 4.6) (Benham
2001; Herring 2001; Texas State Historical Association 2001b). In 1839-1840, a Mexican trade
caravan traveled through the region while seeking a more direct trade route between Chihuahua,
Mexico, and the United States. The Chihuahua
Expedition was unsuccessful; however, the route
became known as the Chihuahua Trail (Figure
4.7) (Swift 2001). A few years later, the Snively
Expedition of 1843 assembled near Coffee’s Station and then marched westward along a portion
of the Chihuahua Trail in an attempt to retaliate
against Mexico for the “indignities” perpetrated
against Texians during previous expeditions (Carroll 2001). Hostilities apparently did not occur in
the vicinity of the current project corridor; however, traffic did extend through the study region.
Several of the early landholders along the
current project corridor served the Texian cause
during the revolutionary and Republic years.

These men or their heirs (if killed in battle) received donation or bounty land grants for their
military service (Table 4.2). James Heffelfinger
served with Captain William Becknell’s Red River County volunteer company in 1836 and 1838.
Guadalupe Garcia and John Sellers also served
with Republic troops between 1835 and 1845, as
did William Birdwell, Orlando James, and Asa
Rinehart [Rhinehart]. William S. Armstrong, William F. Savage, and Green B. Buckhannan [Buchanan] all lost their lives under Colonel James
Fannin’s command in 1836 – Armstrong with
Captain Amon B. King’s Auxiliary Volunteers at
Refugio Mission March 14-15, Savage with Captain Jack Shackelford’s Alabama Red Rovers at
Coleto Creek on March 19, and Buchanan with
Fannin’s Georgia Battalion at Goliad on March
27 – leaving their heirs to take up their northeastern Texas acreage (Maxey 2002, 2004; McKeehan 2003).

Antebellum Texas
On December 29, 1845, the U.S. Congress
accepted the state constitution for Texas, and the
official transfer of government was made on February 16, 1846, at a joint meeting of members of
both the former republic and the new state governing bodies. Shortly thereafter, the new Texas
State Legislature created a number of new counties, including four of the current project counties. Grayson County was carved from northeastern Fannin County on March 17, 1846, and
it was christened for Peter W. Grayson, who had
served as attorney general for the Texas Republic. To the southeast, Hopkins and Titus Counties
were named for area pioneers: the David Hopkins
family that settled in the district during the early
1840s, and Andrew Jackson Titus, a Red River
County planter who was part of the Texas statehood movement. Cass County, easternmost of
the project counties, honored U.S. Senator Lewis
Cass, a Michigan legislator who encouraged the
annexation of Texas to the United States (Table

In general, northeastern Texas developed
rapidly during the last decades of the antebellum
era, despite the effects of the Texas Revolution
and subsequent border conflicts. In 1850, the first
census year that Texas existed as a U.S. state, the
aggregate population of the counties encompassing the project corridor was 24,930, a number
that consisted of 19,194 whites, 8 free people of
color, and 5,728 slaves. A decade later, there were
46,067 whites, 15 free people of color, 6 Native
Americans, and 15,788 slaves in the combined
counties for a total of 61,876 inhabitants, nearly
two and a half times the 1850 tally (Table 4.3)
(Geostat 2004; Lowe and Campbell 1987:11-13,

Like most of settled Texas, the project region
was overwhelmingly agricultural in the years before the Civil War (Lowe and Campbell 1987:9,

the country is heavily timbered with oak,
walnut, ash, elm, and cedar. Cotton is the
staple (Fisher 1853:362).

The common elements noted in these entries –
drainage, topography, soil, and crops – emphasize the importance of agriculture in the district
during the antebellum period. In addition, a comparison of the farm and manufacturing establishment figures recorded in the census records of the
period indicates the general lack of industrial development in the project region prior to the Civil
War (Table 4.4).
On the eve of the Civil War, cotton was the
principal cash crop and corn the chief subsistence
crop cultivated in the project counties. Other regional crops included wheat and other grains,
Irish potatoes, and sweet potatoes. Beef cattle
were the predominant livestock raised in the district, although they were not the “cash crop” that
they became in the locale during the twentieth
century. Hogs, dairy cattle, and sheep also were
raised, primarily for home consumption (Lowe
and Campbell 1987:24-31; Silverthorne 1986:19;
Texas State Historical Association 2001-2006a).
The study area primarily was a district of
small subsistence farms, rather than large-scale
plantations; therefore, slavery held relatively less
importance there than in other areas of the state.
Although the number of slaves increased dramatically in the project counties between 1850 and
1860, particularly in Hopkins and Titus Counties,
they still represented only 25.5 percent of the aggregate population in 1860 (Figure 4.8). In ad-

dition, only 2,257, or approximately 4.9 percent,
of the recorded free residents of the combined
counties were slaveholders on the eve of the Civil
War, with the highest percentage residing in Cass
County, which recorded 354 slave owners among
its 4,936 free residents, only 7.2 percent (Geostat
2004; (Texas State Historical Association 20012006a).
No railroads were constructed through the
project counties prior to the Civil War, and the region continued to rely on the sparse road system
and the limited navigable rivers for transportation
through northeastern Texas. In 1858, the Butterfield Overland Mail (or Southern Overland Mail)
was established, connecting California settlers to
the eastern United States via northern Texas. The
eastern passenger and mail service began in St.
Louis, Missouri, and Memphis, Tennessee, with
the two routes meeting at Fort Smith, Arkansas,
to form a single route (nicknamed the Oxbow
Route) that dipped southwestward to San Diego
and then extended northwestward to San Francisco, a 4,506 km (2,800 mi) journey made within 25 days, with stagecoaches leaving the east
and west terminals twice weekly. The stage line
crossed the Red River at Colbert’s Ferry in Grayson County (north of present-day Denison) and
made a stop some 24.1 km (15 mi) to the southwest in Sherman, the Grayson County seat, which
became a mail distribution center for the northeastern Texas settlements in 1859 (Figure 4.9).
The Overland Mail route through Texas ended in
March 1861, when the U.S. Congress passed legislation that directed the Butterfield line to a more
centrally situated cross-country passage – a move
actuated by a combination of financial troubles,
Apache hostilities in the New Mexico Territory,
and impending Civil War in the United States (Essin 1985:200-211; Hague 1985:161-162; Mazzio
2003; Richardson 2001).
The Butterfield Overland Mail was one of the
best known mail routes through Texas; however,
on the eve of the Civil War, there were 31 stagecoach lines in operation throughout the state, primarily in more heavily populated eastern Texas.
Postal routes began via horseback in 1835, during
the Texas Revolution period, and stage lines were
established a few years later. Semi-weekly stage
routes apparently did not reach the project coun-

ties until the 1850s. The previously discussed
Overland Mail passed through Grayson County,
and two stage lines terminated at Clarksville, the
Red River County seat. Risher and Sawyer established a route between San Antonio, Dallas, and
Clarksville ca. 1858; and another stagecoach line
ran from Clarksville through Bonham to Waco.
Both of these routes probably crossed the currently proposed pipeline corridor – the latter in
Lamar County between Paris and Bonham, and
the Risher and Sawyer line somewhere along the
central part of the project corridor southwest of
Clarksville. The previously discussed Butterfield Overland Mail route passed through Grayson County at least 16.1 km (10 mi) west of the
western terminus of the current pipeline corridor;
however, its impact on the development of the
Sherman environs affected the growth of the surrounding region, as well (Essin 1985:210-211;
Stephens and Holmes 1989:38; Stever 2001).
The Civil War
Although much of northeastern Texas did
not rely on a plantation-driven economy, the majority of area citizens supported the secession issue. Among the project counties, only the westernmost – Grayson, Fannin, and Lamar Counties
– voted against the secession of Texas from the
Union in 1861, and, even then, most Unionist citizens in those counties transferred their loyalties
to the Confederacy after Civil War hostilities began. Sources indicate that no major military engagements were fought within the bounds of the
project counties; however, a number of military
companies were raised to support the Confederate cause outside of Texas, as well as on home
ground (Stephens and Holmes 1989:39-40; Texas
State Historical Association 2001-2006a; Wooster
2001).
Over 2,100 Texans joined the Union forces;
however, the vast majority of the state populace
supported the Confederacy (Wooster 2001). In
fact, within the current project corridor, Cass
County was rechristened Davis County in 1861,
after eponymous Michigan politician Lewis Cass
resigned his appointment as U.S. Secretary of
State (1857-1860) in a Unionist “boycott” of a
presidential decision. At the time Cass County
was created in 1846, Senator Cass (U.S. Senate,

1845-1856) was considered “a Northern man
with Southern principles” (Harper 2006b). His
resolute decision to endorse Union activities motivated the Texas State Legislature to change the
name of Cass County to Davis County, thereby
demonstrating Texan support of Jefferson Davis.
It wasn’t until 1871, during the Reconstruction
period, that Republican majority state legislators
restored the county name to Cass (Genealogy Inc.
2006; Harper 2006b; U.S. Congress ca. 2007).
A far more serious anti-Unionist incident
occurred in early October 1862, when 150 suspected Union sympathizers were “rounded up” in
Grayson and other north-central Texas counties,
and they were tried by a biased citizens’ court in
Gainesville, Cooke County (adjoining the western side of Grayson County). There were 26 men
condemned and hanged, and 14 lynched in what
became known as the Great Hanging at Gainesville. In addition, there were other violent events
leading up to, during, and following the Great
Hanging, including the execution of five alleged
Unionists in Sherman, the Grayson County seat
(Kumler 2006; McCaslin 2001; Wooster 2001).
An estimated 75,000 – 90,000 Texans were
mustered into military service during the war years
(Stephens and Hopkins 1989:40; Wooster 2001).
Concerned over the Union threat to the bordering
states of Missouri and Arkansas and convinced
that Confederate “success cannot be secured
without the assistance of Texas,” Governor Francis “Frank” R. Lubbock issued a statewide call to
arms in the summer of 1861 (U.S. Secretary of
War [OR], Series I, 1997:4:95). Numerous companies of troops were raised throughout the state
to support the Confederate war effort. According
to one historian, “The one great contribution of
Texas to the Southern cause was men” (Fehrenbach 1991:354). Residents of the project counties
enlisted in various Confederate units, including
Bourland’s Texas Cavalry, the 1st Texas Partisan
Rangers (a cavalry unit also known as the Texas Frontier Regiment), Maxey’s Lamar Rifles,
Howell’s Texas Battery, Daniel’s Lamar Artillery,
and several other military contingents. In addition, area men served in the 11th Texas Cavalry,
which, in early May 1861, seized the Federal
forts located across the Red River in Indian Terri-

tory (Brothers ca. 2002; Smith 1992:58-61; Texas
State Historical Association 2001-2006a).
During the last two years of the war, much of
the military activity throughout the project region
apparently was focused on tracking down deserters and renegades. By 1863, troop desertion
had become such a problem in north-central and
northeastern Texas that General Henry E. McCulloch, commander of the Northern Sub-District
(the Confederate military district covering that
region of Texas), complained that he didn’t have
the forces to flush out these men. In late October
1863, William Clarke Quantrill and his infamous
Missouri raiders were assigned to help McCulloch
in this task. Unfortunately, Quantrill and his band
(including “Bloody Bill” Anderson, Cole Younger, and Frank James [possibly 16-year-old Jesse
James, as well]) were fresh from their notorious
raid on Lawrence, Kansas (August 21, 1863) and
the Baxter Springs Massacre (October 6, 1863),
and they ultimately killed more deserters in Texas
than they captured (Fehrenbach 1991:365; Smith
1992:78-79, 110; 2001). General McCulloch,
who long had wished to be rid of Quantrill and
his guerillas, reported his alarm over the situation
in several reports, including the following statement:
Many robberies, thefts, and murders have been
committed in the country …, some of which
have been traced to Captain Quantrill’s company proper, and others to some of the men who
came here with him last fall ...; and I assure you
the Captain Quantrill command has been a terror
to the country and a curse to our land and cause
in this section, and I never have been able to
control them, because I have not had troops that
had the moral and physical courage to arrest and
disarm them, less than which never would have
done any good (OR 1997, Series I:34[3]:742).

McCulloch’s attempts to rein in Quantrill were
unsuccessful. In late March of 1864, Quantrill
escaped arrest for his crimes, and he and his men
crossed the Red River into the Indian Territory
(Smith 1992:110-111; 2001).
Much of the project region was situated
within Quantrill’s track, which swept through
the Red River counties and neighboring districts
that had become sanctuary to many deserters,

the conflict. Nevertheless, the social consequences of the war, such as the losses in lives and property and the collapsed southern economy, were
significant here as elsewhere. It was not until the
late nineteenth century that the regional economy
began to recover from the effects of the Civil War
(Campbell 1997:8).
Conflict and violence were rampant in the
project region during the Reconstruction years,
particularly in Grayson, Fannin, and Hopkins
Counties. Although some events were raciallycharged and politically-motivated, many incidents
apparently occurred due to sheer lawlessness. For
example, shortly following the end of Civil War
hostilities in Texas, a district court judge based in
Mount Pleasant, Titus County, sent a request to
the commander of the Union occupying force in
Shreveport for a military presence to be assigned
to Lamar County. On June 22, 1865, Judge B. W.
Gray wrote:

draft dodgers, and renegades (OR 1997, Series
I:26[2]:469-471; Smith 1992:62, 70-86). Grayson and Fannin Counties, in particular, experienced much of this activity. Quantrill had at least
two known camps in Grayson County – one on
Mineral Springs Creek and another at Kentucky
Town. The latter community was situated about
29 km (18 mi) southeast of Sherman and perhaps
19.3 km (12 mi) south of the currently proposed
pipeline route. Sources differ as to whether the
Mineral Springs Creek campsite was located 24
km [15 mi] northwest or northeast of Sherman.
The northeastern position would place the Quantrill camp very near the current project corridor;
however, no evidence has been found to verify
that location (Brothers 2000; Kumler 2001; Smith
2006).
Besides the Quantrill camps, there were
other Confederate posts and encampments situated within the project counties. These locations included Camps Brogden, Farmington, and
Reeves in Grayson County; Camp Benjamin in
Fannin County; Camps Jackson and Rusk in Lamar County (the latter now part Delta County);
and Camps Albert Sidney Johnston and Jefferson Davis in Red River County. In addition, the
Fannin County seat of Bonham served as headquarters for the Confederate Northern Military
Sub-District of Texas; and Sherman, Paris, and
Clarksville (governmental centers for Grayson,
Lamar, and Red River Counties, respectively) all
served as command points, as well. Taking advantage of the abundant beef and grain supplies
of the Red River border counties, both Bonham
and Paris also were designated Confederate quartermaster depots. None of these locations appear
to have been situated in the immediate vicinity of
the project corridor; however, transitory military
traffic certainly must have crossed the currently
proposed pipeline route at various times during
the Civil War years (Figure 4.10) (Brothers 2000;
OR 1997; Pigott 2006; Smith 1992:66-67; Wooster 2001).

… since the surrender a gang of lawless desperadoes are disregarding all social rights of the
people, capturing private property, endangering
the lives of the unoffending, and committing
every species of lawlessness. The outrages are
principally committed by persons who are only
temporarily sojourning in the country, aided by
persons and their co-workers who have held civil commissions under the authority of the Government (OR, Series I, 1997:48[2]:968)..

During this troubled postwar period, Federal
troops were sent into certain areas to restore order;
however, violence and intimidation continued for
several years, abetted by an active Ku Klux Klan
organization. Order generally was reinstated in the
region by the mid-1870s, a period marked by the
end of Congressional Reconstruction and the reestablishment of native home rule in 1870, and a
new state constitution in effect in 1876 (Campbell
1997:19-26, 225-232; Texas State Historical Association 2001-2006a).
The hostile incidents reported to officials during the Reconstruction period included numerous
threats, beatings, injuries, and killings of Unionists and freedmen within the project counties. In
Red River County, the volatile atmosphere forced
Freedmen’s Bureau agent Charles Franklin Rand
to flee for his life in August of 1868 (ironically,
Captain Rand was a former Federal Army officer

a district of lawless activity for many years despite
a Federal military presence that simply wasn’t
strong enough to control such events (Crouch
2001; Freedmen’s Bureau Online 2000; Harper
2006a; Maddox 1997; Patterson 2005).
Immigration to Texas increased during the
Reconstruction period. The majority of these settlers were Southerners who viewed Texas as a
land of opportunity – a place to begin again following the devastation of the Civil War in their
home states (Moneyhon 2004:163). During the
postbellum years, legislation was passed to create
new counties to accommodate the growing population. On July 29, 1870, Delta County was carved
from southern Lamar and northern Hopkins Counties. Named for its triangular configuration, Delta
County was created largely to ease the isolation

who later was awarded the U.S. Congressional
Medal of Honor for bravery in action during the
Civil War). To the west, the murder-ridden LeePeacock feud between the family and friends of
a former Confederate officer and local Unionists
(former friends, neighbors, and even some relatives) carried on from 1867 to mid-1871 in the
“Four Corners” area, the convergence of Grayson,
Fannin, Hunt, and Collin Counties. Other notorious acts were perpetrated by Cullen Montgomery
Baker, the “Swamp Fox of the Sulphur,” who, until his assassination in early 1869, frequently returned home to Cass County between violent forays with his gang through northeastern Texas and
southwestern Arkansas. In short, the Reconstruction chronicle, both official accounts and local
lore, indicates that the Red River region remained

concerns of those settlers who lived between the
bounding North and South Sulphur Rivers. Half
a decade later, in the spring of 1875, Titus County
was subdivided into three districts, with Franklin County organized from the western side and
Morris County from the eastern side of the parent
county. The demarcation legislation did not specifically designate the origin of these two new county
names; however, it is generally acknowledged that
Franklin was christened in honor of Benjamin
Cromwell Franklin and William Wright Morris,
both of whom were respected Texas judges and
legislators (Table 4.1: county development) (Genealogy Inc. 2006; Harper 2006c, 2006d; Hazlewood 2001; Kemp 2001b; McCroskey 2006a).
Because the immediate project region never
had relied on a plantation economy, agriculture
in the area recovered more quickly from the effects of the Civil War than it did in other parts of
the South. In 1870, the project counties recorded
an aggregate total of 6,065 farms, most of which
were under 50 ac (20.24 ha) in size, with the exception of Red River County, where the majority of farms measured 20 – 100 ac (8.09 – 40.47
ha) in size. Only two farms containing 1,000 ac
(404.7 ha) or more were reported in the study
area in that census year – one each in Hopkins
and Red River Counties. Within a decade, each of
the project counties included multiple large farms
or ranches of at least 1,000 ac (404.7 ha), but by

the turn of the century, that number had dropped
from a high of 170 in 1880, to 90 in 1900. The average acreage fell, as well – from 131.4 ac (53.18
ha) in 1880, to 77.1 ac (31.20 ha) in 1900 (Table
4.5) (Geostat 2004).
The tenant/sharecropper system did not gain
ground in northeastern Texas as quickly as it did
in other parts of the postbellum South. Within the
project counties, most farms remained owneroperated through 1890. In that census year, 56
percent of the aggregate 24,227 farms across the
study area were owner-cultivated; only Fannin
and Red River Counties reported an owner minority – 46 percent and 47 percent, respectively. By
the turn of the century, though, all of the project
counties but Hopkins, Franklin, Titus, and Cass
recorded more tenant/sharecropper farmers than
owners (Geostat 2004).
Cotton remained the primary cash crop of the
project region during the postbellum years. Other
crops included corn, wheat, oats, sorghum, and
various grains. Almost immediately after the end
of the Civil War, livestock values began catching
up to crop values in the project counties; however, cotton continued to dominate regional agriculture. Besides beef cattle, area livestock included
hogs, dairy cattle, sheep, poultry (chickens, guinea hens, turkeys), and smaller numbers of horses
and mules (Geostat 2004; Texas State Historical
Association 2001-2006a).

Chapter IV: History
An important element in the economic development of eastern Texas was the evolution of
the cattle drive. Despite the proximity of the border counties to steamer transport along the navigable rivers, trailing their herds inland was the
most practical method for ranchers to send their
cattle to market during the postbellum years. The
Shawnee Trail was the earliest-established of the
cattle trails; it extended northward from Brownsville through Dallas, then to the Red River, and on
through Oklahoma and Missouri. The principal
route used for cattle drives until the late 1860s,
the Shawnee Trail began as a Native American
pathway that later was followed by settlers entering Texas from Missouri and the Midwest. Over
the years it was known variously as the Texas
Road, the Preston Road, the Sedalia (Missouri)
Trail, and the Kansas Trail; however, Shawnee
Trail was the name used most commonly by cattlemen. By 1867, it was part of the trail system
that fed into the Chisholm Trail, the chief cattle
trail used between 1867 and 1884. Although the
project counties were not part of Texas “beef
country,” the cattle industry was tremendously
important to the Grayson County economy due
to the Red River crossing near Preston Bend, a
short distance northwest of present-day Denison
(Figure 4.11) (Fehrenbach 1991:552-568; Gard
1954:25-29, 76-79; 2001; Kumler 2006; Worcester 1980).
Although railroads had been promoted
through the Texas Red River region as early as the
1850s, no lines were completed through the project counties until the postbellum period. The first
railroad lines to be constructed through the study
area were the Houston and Texas Central Railway and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway
(known commonly as the Katy line), two northsouth lines that entered Grayson County in 1872.
They were followed almost immediately by the
Texas and Pacific Railway (later held in part by
the Missouri Pacific System), an east-west line
that traversed northeastern Texas ca. 1873-1876
(Figure 4.12). Other rail lines quickly followed,
bringing much-needed advances in interior transportation and providing connections to market
towns, both inside and outside of the state (Table
4.6) (Figure 4.13) (Texas State Historical Association 2001, 2001-2006a).

With the railroads came more settlers and
increased prosperity in the region. Sherman and
Paris, the county seats of Grayson and Lamar, respectively, became important railway centers by
the turn of the century (Hart 2004; Harvill 2001).
In addition, new communities evolved around the
rail stations, including Brookston and Howland
in southwestern Lamar County, Naples in northeastern Morris County, and Bivins in southeastern
Cass County – towns all located within 1.6 km (1
mi) of the current pipeline route. Brookston was
named for A. D. Brooks, owner of the townsite
acreage, and it served as the temporary terminus for the Texas and Pacific Railroad during the
construction delay caused by the financial Panic
of 1873. Howland originally was established as
Pleasant Grove (later Grove P.O.) in 1880, but
during the early 1890s, it shifted a short distance
to the west in anticipation of construction of the
Texas Midland Railroad. The local citizenry further demonstrated their enthusiasm for the new rail
line by rechristening their town for Edward Howland R. Green, son of Texas Midland owner Hetty
Green. Naples evolved from Belden, or Station
Belden, a depot built along the Texas and St. Louis Railroad in 1880. As the town grew into a significant shipping center, the post office requested
suggestions for a new name from area residents,
and, accordingly, Station Belden became Naples
in 1895. Prior to its development as a community,
Bivins was the location of two large sawmills that
were constructed ca. 1884 near Hoxie (or Hoxie’s), a station on the Texas and Pacific Railroad
that became known as Wayne P.O. in 1883. The
sawmill locality quickly became both a shipping
point and a popular local gathering spot. Consequently, the Wayne post office was moved closer
to the sawmills in 1889, and the community that
developed there was named in honor of sawmill
owners J. K. and Frank H. Bivins 1876 (Figures
4.12 and 4.13) (Harper 2001-2006; McCroskey
2002, 2006b).
he most significant railroad town to develop
within the project region probably was Denison
in northern Grayson County. Located a short distance south of the Red River, a few kilometers
northeast of Sherman (and about 11.3 - 12.9 km
[7 - 8 mi] northwest of the current project corridor, Denison was surveyed during the summer

Chapter IV: History
of 1872, and it was named for George Denison,
the vice-president of the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas Railway. The first “Katy” train pulled into
the new town on Christmas Eve 1872, and by
the time Denison was incorporated the following
summer, the flourishing rail town boasted over
3,000 residents. By the turn of the century, five
more rail lines made Denison a hub that, for a
time, eclipsed the Grayson County seat of Sherman in importance (Figure 4.13: Rand McNally
map 1883) (Hart 2004; Kumler 2006; Minor
2006).
Relatively steady population growth was recorded in all of the project counties during the
last decades of the nineteenth century, with an
aggregate increase of 78.5 percent between 1880
and 1900 (Table 4.7). This expansion was due
in large part to improved access to the area after
railroads were introduced in the region. Throughout the late nineteenth century, the regional populace maintained a significant white majority, as it
had during the antebellum decades; however, a
contrast may be observed between those counties
that formerly utilized more slave labor to cultivate
the land and those that traditionally relied on subsistence agriculture. For instance, on the eve of
the Civil War, Cass County recorded the highest
number of slaves among the project counties, with
3,475 recorded in 1860, i.e., 41.3 percent of the entire county population. Hopkins County reported
only 990 slaves in that census year – 12.8 percent
of its population. In 1870, Cass County (or Davis
County, as it was known at that time) recorded an
African American population of 3,379, or 38.1 percent of its inhabitants. Hopkins County, which had
fewer emancipated bondsmen living in the district
following the end of the Civil War, reported 1,620
African American residents in 1870 – a greater
number, but the same 12.8 percentage that existed
prior to the war. Although their overall populations
increased over the next three decades, the county
racial balances changed only slightly, with Cass
County and Hopkins County recording 8,908 (39
percent) and 3,808 (13.6 percent) African Americans, respectively, in 1900 (Geostat 2004; Texas
State Historical Association 2001-2006a).
Northeastern Texas generally prospered during the late nineteenth century – the expanding
railway network, population growth, and evolv-

ing settlements all contributed to the development of the region. Agriculture remained the
chief economic influence throughout the district,
and much of the industry that was established in
the project counties during the postbellum period
was related to that factor. Sherman, the Grayson
County seat, became a milling center, with five
flour mills and the largest grain elevator in the
region (i.e., north of Dallas) by 1876, and the
world’s largest cottonseed oil mill by 1891; while
Denison, to the northeast, boasted a large flour
mill, two cotton compresses (machinery to pack
and reduce the size of cotton bales for shipment),
and a slaughterhouse that could process 700 cattle
per day. Bonham, governmental center of Fannin
County, was home to gristmills, cotton gins, and
the Bonham Cotton Mill (established in 1900),
which later expanded to become the largest such
facility located west of the Mississippi River.
Cotton gins, feed mills, corn mills, flour mills,
and tanneries were scattered throughout the project region, and railroad towns became important,
at least locally, as market and shipping centers for
area farmers (Texas State Historical Association
2001-2006a, 2001-2006b).
As the nineteenth century drew to a close, the
timber industry became increasingly important to
the regional economy. Following the Civil War,
vast quantities of lumber were needed to repair
the wartime ravages throughout the South and to
supply the demands of Northern industry. Eastern
Texas contained vast expanses of old-growth pine
forests, hardwoods, and cypress stands, but until
the construction of railroads through the region
during the postbellum decades, there was no effective way to transport lumber to market from
the interior. Prior to that time, timbermen floated
cut logs down the rivers of the district to market
town sawmills, but the railroad enabled the development of interior sawmills, spawning a lumber boom that lasted into the 1920s. A number of
short lines were constructed to transport timber
from the interior lumber camps to the sawmill
and manufacturing towns; trunk lines then carried
shipments of shingles, doors, building materials,
furniture, and even railroad ties to markets along
the main railway lines. Short lines within the project region included the Sullivan-Stanford Lumber
Company narrow-gauge railroad, which connect58

Chapter IV: History
ed Naples (Morris County) to the timber country
between the Sulphur River and White Oak Creek,
and the Black Bayou Lumber Company tram line
(constructed later, ca. 1904), which carried timber from the cypress and pine stands along the
Texas/Louisiana border to the sawmill towns of
eastern Cass County. Associated industries developed throughout the region: sawmills, planing
mills, furniture and shingle factories, wagon and
railroad tie manufacturers, and other fabricators
of lumber products (Buenger 2001:42-44; Hammond 2006; Texas State Historical Association
2001-2006a, 2001-2006b).
The preceding paragraphs generally outline the improvements advanced by the expanding railroad network through the project region;
however, by facilitating transportation and commerce, the rail system also incidentally contributed to a darker chapter in the history of the study
area. During the 1880s, lynchings became more
commonplace in northeastern Texas. One regional historian (Buenger 2001) has speculated
that the burgeoning developments in postbellum
agriculture and industry, aided by the rapidly
growing railway system, attracted “outsider” African Americans with no families or established
relationships in newly prosperous towns such as
Paris (Lamar County) and Mount Pleasant (Titus
County). Prior to the mid-1880s, lynchings were
not uncommon in the region, but they were not
necessarily racially motivated. In fact, more often
than not, the violence was directed against whites
rather than the minority African American population. The nineteenth century lynchings peaked
in Texas during the mid-1890s, as did the savage
brutality applied in their executions. One particularly horrific event occurred in Paris in early 1893,
with the slow torture and burning of Henry Smith
by a law officer and his family before a crowd of
over 15,000. Again, the railroad played a part – a
commissioned Texas and Pacific coach brought
the arrested man to town, and passenger cars carried the masses who came to watch. Newspaper
accounts bemoaned the barbarism, but, at the
same time, noted the “good example” set. A few
days later, Governor James Hogg condemned the
atrocity of the Henry Smith lynching, and, while
no immediate action was taken, the wheels were
set in motion for the passing of the Texas anti-

lynching law in 1897, legislation that did not end
lynching activity, but at least contributed to its
decline (Buenger 2001:3-4, 19-26; Ross 2001).
Twentieth Century to the Present
After the turn of the century, agriculture
throughout the project region continued to focus
on cotton; however, within a few years, the boll
weevil presented a new and extremely serious
threat to the production of the fiber. Spreading
from Mexico through Texas between 1892 and
the 1920s, this destructive beetle decimated crops
throughout much of Texas cotton country, covering southeastern Texas by 1903 and reaching the
Red River by 1904. Agricultural reformers worked
hard to educate cotton farmers in preparation for
the oncoming infestation – information was dispensed regarding successful defense measures in
other areas and demonstration farms were established to experiment and improve farming techniques. Although the boll weevil caused considerable destruction to Texas cotton fields, the pest
also prompted long-needed changes in agriculture throughout the state (Buenger 2001:111-113;
Wagner 2001).
Despite the boll weevil infestation in the district, cotton remained the dominant crop in the
project region throughout the early twentieth century. Other important crops in the project counties
included corn, oats, and other grains; and small
farmers diversified with potatoes, truck vegetables, peaches and other orchard crops, strawberries, melons, and a smaller sugar cane crop for
syrup. Livestock also remained a significant part
of the agricultural economy of the area, particularly beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and poultry
(Texas State Historical Association 2001-2006a).
As noted previously, farm tenancy and
sharecropping were not major factors in the agricultural economy of the project counties during the late nineteenth century; however, by the
early twentieth century, those systems were entrenched firmly throughout northeastern Texas.
In 1890, tenants occupied fewer than half of the
farms within the study area; a decade later, owner-operated farms were in the minority. By 1910,
tenants operated 24,677 of the combined 41,243
farms in the ten project counties, i.e., nearly 60
percent of the aggregate number. The percentage

of tenancy increased in the ensuing decades, and
it reached its peak within the study area in 1930,
when the federal census recorded a combined total of 41,288 farms in the project counties, 27,737
of which, or 67.2 percent, were tenant-operated.
The Depression era brought a decline in tenancy
as “hard times, increasing mechanization, and opportunities for employment elsewhere” reduced
the numbers of sharecroppers and tenant farmers
in the regional labor force (Harper 2006a). By
mid-century, owner-operated farms once again
were in the majority throughout the project counties (Table 4.8) (Geostat 2004).
The increased dependence on tenancy in
the project region during the early decades of the
twentieth century contributed to a resurgence of
violence during that period. As sharecropping/tenancy practices expanded throughout the district,
particularly with the boost in cotton prices during
World War I, more African American sharecroppers moved into areas from which established
African American farmers and semi-skilled laborers migrated, seeking better opportunities. As
in the late nineteenth century, the white population became suspicious of new African American
arrivals with no established local ties (Buenger
2001:164-172; Haley 1993:30-31, 164). One area
historian has suggested the following theory:

Once again, the region became a lynching center.
During the four decades spanning 1883 – 1923,
whites in northeastern Texas lynched 46 African Americans, including at least 3 in Red River
County, 5 in Cass County, 7 in Hopkins County,
and 13 in Lamar County. There was considerably
more outrage and condemnation of these savage
events in the twentieth century than in the nineteenth century, and finally, after 1922, lynchings
declined in the region and, in fact, throughout the
state (Buenger 2001:165-166).
At least one more notable incident of violence occurred within the project region several
years later, during the Great Depression: the
Sherman Riot of 1930. White tenant farmers in
Grayson County had been hit hard by the economic decline, and there was increased hostility
toward African Americans throughout the area.
Accusations of the rape and mutilation of a farmer’s wife (later proved exaggerated) were made
against an African American farm hand. During
the trial, a mob stormed and fired the courthouse,
burning and blasting the building, which resulted
in a horrible death for the suspect. Rioting, fires,
threats, and considerable property damage followed, resulting in the declaration of martial law,
which was upheld by Texas Rangers and over 400
National Guardsmen. Although the situation was
quelled within a few weeks, the Sherman Riot initiated incidents of racial violence throughout the
state of Texas during the following year (Haley
1993:164-166; Hart 2004; Texas State Library &
Archives Commission 2005; Thompson 2004).
Although agriculture and farm tenancy dominated the economy of the project region during the

Lynching was a form of labor control in a scarce
labor market where blacks could easily move several counties over and find employment. This increase in economic opportunity caused blacks …
to resist what they perceived as unjust treatment.
Whites in turn grew increasingly determined not
only to maintain the labor pool, but to force blacks
to stay in their place (Buenger 2001:169).

early twentieth century, the timber industry also
had an impact of some consequence in the district.
In 1907, Texas ranked third among timber-producing states, with a cut of over 2.25 billion board
feet of lumber that year. The state timber industry
accelerated again during World War I, when the
demand increased for the construction of wooden
ships for freight transport; however, the virgin forests generally were depleted by the 1920s. During
the early years of the Depression, lumber production dropped to a low of 350 million board feet
statewide in 1932. Reforestation programs have
been instituted since that time, but the height of the
timbering era in many areas has passed (Maxwell
2001; Texas State Historical Association 20012006a).
Both the Great Depression and World War
II seriously affected the twentieth century development of the project region. Population fell,
timber work dwindled, and farm values declined
throughout the district as people left the rural
areas for the cities. Most of the project counties
experienced significant population declines during the twentieth century, particularly between
1950 and 1970. In fact, Fannin, Delta, and Franklin Counties all fell below their respective 1890
census totals in 1950; Lamar, Red River, and
Hopkins Counties followed that course a decade
later. Fannin, Lamar, and Titus Counties reached
their twentieth century lows in 1970, but it was
1980 before Delta County hit its greatest population slump. Within the study area, only Grayson
County maintained relatively steady population
growth during the twentieth century, recover-

ing fairly quickly from a Depression-era drop,
largely due to the construction of Denison Dam
and the development of the Lake Texoma reservoir ca. 1938-1944, the construction of Perrin Air
Force Base in 1941, and the discovery of oil in
the county ca. 1930 (Table 4.9) (Kumler 2006;
Texas State Historical Association 2001-2006a).
Although agriculture has remained a major
local force in the area throughout the twentieth
century, the economic and physical landscape of
the project region began to change with the discovery of oil and natural gas in the project counties ca. 1930-1936 (Figure 4.14). The petroleum
industry counteracted some of the deleterious effects of the Great Depression in those counties
where oil fields were discovered (specifically,
Grayson, Hopkins, Franklin, Titus, and Cass
Counties); however, it did not become the boom
industry that it became in other parts of Texas.
Still, as petroleum exploration and production
increased, so did related employment in the oil
fields and refineries. Petroleum exploration and
production continued after the initial boom, but
the field discoveries in the project counties did
not generate enough activity to notably change
the area economy (Kumler 2006; Harper 2001,
2006b, 2006c; Stephens and Holmes 1989:45).
Although early petroleum operations largely
bypassed Morris County, the district was home
to significant iron ore deposits. There was some
crude mining activity on a small scale prior to the
Civil War; however, it wasn’t until the outbreak
of World War II that exploitation of the county
mineral resources became profitable. An enor-

mous amount of iron was needed in support of the
war effort, and in 1943, the U.S. Defense Plant
Corporation constructed a blast furnace and related operations about 9.7 km (6 mi) south of the
Morris County seat of Daingerfield.(and 29 km
[18 mi], more or less, south of the current project corridor). In 1940, only 63 county inhabitants
worked in manufacturing; by 1947, there were
568. After the Lone Star Steel Company took
over operations in the late 1940s, the plant employed over 1,000 area residents and more than
triple that number during the 1950s as the facility
expanded. Consequently, Morris County remains
an industrial center to the present day, attracting
workers from neighboring counties as well as
its own populace (Connor 2006; Harper 2006b,
2006d).
Today, the project counties remain part of a
largely agricultural region. In 1987, there were
10,594 farms or ranches situated throughout the
10 project counties; by 2002, there were 12,629.
Most of the acreage was devoted to cropland;
however, significant land was designated as pasture. Despite its fall from prominence in the region, cotton remains a significant cash crop in Red
River, Grayson, Lamar, and Delta Counties, which
ranked 101st, 118th, 127th, and 129th, respectively, in Texas upland cotton production in 2005.
Other regional crops include hay, soybeans, nursery and turf crops, watermelons, berries, peanuts,
truck crops (vegetables), pecans and other orchard
crops, forage crops, and grain crops of wheat, corn,
and sorghum. Beef cattle and poultry (and related
processing facilities) dominate the livestock industry in most of the project counties; other important
regional livestock include dairy cattle, hogs, sheep,
and horses. Hopkins County, in fact, has been a
leading dairy producer since the late 1930s, and
in 1990, it ranked first in Texas dairy production,
with nearly 500 dairies yielding about 17 percent
of the total yield for the state (National Cotton
Council of America 2007; Texas State Historical
Association 2001-2006a; USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service 2004, 2006).
In addition to agribusiness, the timber industry has remained a significant economic factor in the project region, particularly in Fannin,
Red River, Franklin, Morris, and Cass Counties,
where wood products (lumber, paper, etc.) re-

main primary commodities. Manufacturing has
increased throughout the region during recent
decades, including the construction of plastics
plants in Franklin County and the expansion of
the Lone Star Steel facilities in Morris County.
Grayson County has become an important manufacturing, distribution, and trade center for the
Red River region – both Texas and Oklahoma –
due to the continued growth of the cities of Denison and Sherman (Texas State Historical Association 2001-2006a, 2001-2006b).
Historical Features Situated within the Current Project Corridor
A study of maps and records regarding the
geographic location of the current pipeline route
indicates that a number of historical features are
or may be situated within the bounds of the proposed project corridor, which extends 1.6 km (1
mi) beyond the center line. These features include
cemeteries, towns, railroads, roads, and ferry
crossings. Although a number of these locations
exist today, many have been abandoned, leaving
little or no trace of existence. An examination of
readily available research sources disclosed the
positions or general vicinities of several historical
features that do not appear on current topographic
maps. The following paragraphs and tables briefly discuss these findings.
There are numerous cemeteries scattered
throughout the current project corridor. Some
are associated with communities or churches, but
many are neglected private cemeteries that once
were located on family properties or farms. Some
landholders moved gravestones to the town cemeteries where their families relocated, leaving the
burials behind to become grazing land. Others
simply abandoned their small cemeteries when
they moved away from the area. Overgrowth,
disused property roads, and local population
losses all have conspired to transform these once
carefully-tended plots into forgotten places, some
with no surface traces remaining – only old-timers’ memories. Table 4.10 lists those cemeteries
determined to be situated within, or very near the
current project corridor. Research suggests that
there could be other unrecorded burial plots in
the vicinity; however, it is impossible to locate
them with the information at hand. Archeological

Chapter IV: History
investigations for the current project disclosed no
physical evidence of such unrecorded burials.
The deterioration and abandonment of local
cemeteries mirrors the decline of the communities situated within the study area. Many small
towns and communities are dispersed throughout
the current project corridor. These population
centers evolved diversely – as farming, church,
or school communities, as lumbering/sawmill
towns, as trade centers, and as railroad stops. The
evolution of the railway system and the modern
road network contributed to the growth of many
towns in northeastern Texas, but it also resulted
in the decline of many others. Improvements in
transportation facilitated the migration of residents and businesses from the small farming and
trade communities to larger towns and to rail-side
market and shipping centers. In many cases, only
the cemetery remains to mark the existence of
a once-thriving community. Table 4.11 records
towns and communities known to be, or once to
have been, located within the current project corridor.
The current project corridor is crossed by a
number of roads and railroads, several of which
have contributed to the historical development of
the region. In some instances, former ferry roads
have become field roads or were developed as
part of the modern road system. Undoubtedly,
many such roads probably crossed the study area
at various times during the evolution of the region; however, documentation is sparse regarding

these early byways. Most of the railroads crossing the current project corridor still exist within
consolidated rail networks; however, a few have
been abandoned. Table 4.12 lists those historical
transportation routes known to cross, or once to
have crossed, the current project corridor.
Summary
Historically cotton and cattle country, the
project region has remained largely dependent on
agriculture from earliest settlement to the present
day. Although there were a few large plantations
and ranches in the area, this sparsely populated district of northeastern Texas traditionally was worked
by small farmers and timbermen. Their modest
homes, corrals, and outbuildings probably would
not have survived the years; however, features and
artifacts associated with such complexes may have
become part of the archeological record. In addition, Confederate troop movements traversed the
project vicinity during the Civil War, and, while
no recorded military actions were found to have
occurred within the immediate project corridor,
the troops involved certainly may have passed
through and left material culture evidence within
the study area. Since that time, agriculture, timbering, petroleum exploitation, and road and railway
construction have modified the landscape of the
region, no doubt impacting the existence of any
significant historical sites within the limits of the
current study area.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

T

o address all potential impacts to known
archeological and historic properties prior to pipeline construction, a review was
undertaken of previously completed cultural resources investigations, previously recorded archeological sites, previously recorded historic
standing structures, and all cemeteries within 1.6
km (1 mi) of the Gulf Crossing Project corridor.
Most documents were compiled from archived
materials housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas, and the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas Database and the Texas Historic Sites
Atlas Database, both available electronically. The
search resulted in the identification of 29 cultural
resources investigations, most of which are Phase
I investigations and 112 archeological sites. Two
of the archeological sites are classified as historic standing structures, and four archeological
sites are classified as cemeteries. An additional
39 extant cemeteries are identified within 1.6 km
(1 mi) of the project corridor, three of which are
designated as Texas Historic Cemeteries. None
of the archeological sites or standing structures is
listed on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), and no national or state historic landmarks lie within the project corridor. Research
was somewhat limited by the fact that seven of
the cultural resources investigations are spatially
mapped in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
but corresponding report abstracts are absent
from the database. The literature review at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory office
failed to yield additional documentation related
to these surveys, accounting for the “unknown”
entries in the last rows of Table 5.1.

tigations shown in Table 5.1 are Phase I cultural
resource surveys undertaken to identify new, or
revisit previously recorded, archeological sites.
Cumulatively, these research projects have been
conducted over the last 56 years, with most having occurred within the past three decades. Deliberative survey efforts account for 96 (86 percent)
of the archeological sites identified within 1.6 km
(1 mi) of the proposed pipeline corridor. Three of
the projects (Peter et al. 1989; Perttula and Nathan
1988; Price and Moore 1990) focused on narrow,
linear coverage of two natural gas pipeline routes
(Southern Interconnect and Black Marlin) that are
contiguous with lengthy sections of the proposed
Gulf Crossing Project. Approximately 65 percent of the currently proposed pipeline route runs
parallel with the Southern Interconnect, and that
survey project alone documented 49 percent of
all archeological sites currently known within the
research corridor. The Black Marlin parallels approximately 25 percent of the currently proposed
pipeline route, with only 3.5 percent of corridor
sites recorded. The width of these corridors (75-ft
and 50-ft) is narrower than that proposed (300 to
350-ft), indicating the need for unbroken survey
coverage even where the routes overlap.
Smaller linear projects that bisect the research corridor were undertaken for rural utility
development (n=3), and investigations limited
to road segments were conducted for the Texas
State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (n=7). Remaining projects for which
information is available include two large area
surveys that lie partly within the research corridor, one for development of lignite mining (Jones
et al. 1993) and the other for reservoir construction (Stephenson 1950); and several smaller areal
surveys sponsored by the Army Corps of Engineers (n=5). Non-compliance, research-oriented
investigations are represented by only two projects (Mott 1962a and b; Suhm and Krieger 1954).

Seven projects listed in Table 5.1 represent both
linear and areal surveys that were conducted for
unknown purposes. Documentation of these investigations was not available at TARL, as noted
above.

n=1 [41FN1]

n=2 [41MX29, 41MX30]

Prehistoric sites occur most frequently in the
project corridor (n=83, 74.1 percent), with historic
(n=18, 16.1 percent) and mixed prehistoric/historic (n=10, 9.2 percent) resources also represented.
A single archeological site (41LR009) is not assigned to a time period.
A significant number of prehistoric manifestations are of unknown cultural affiliation (n=44),
which usually indicates that site assemblages are
limited to undiagnostic lithic artifacts. Among
sites where affiliation is ventured, Paleo-Indian
(n=3), Archaic (n=24), Caddo (n=23), and unspecified Late Prehistoric (n=13) components are
recognized in the project corridor. Paleo-Indian
and Archaic sites are usually expressed as lithic
scatters and may be classified as open campsites,
particularly where burned rock features are pres-

Previously Recorded Archeological Sites
The records search yielded documentation for
112 archeological sites within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of
the Gulf Crossing Project (Table 5.2). Sixteen of
these resources were recorded independently of the
projects discussed above. Most sites are recorded in
Titus County (n=46, 42.2 percent of the total), followed by the counties of Franklin (n=21, 19.2 percent), Cass (n=17, 12.8 percent), Lamar (n=13, 11.9
percent), Morris (n=7, 6.4 percent), Fannin (n=6,
5.5 percent), and Red River (n=2, 1.8 percent).

Chapter V: Previous Investigations
ent. Archaic tripartite divisions (Early, Middle and
Late) are rarely distinguished at sites in the project
corridor but are recognized regionally on the basis of projectile point styles and tool kits. Ground
stone tools and burned rock features become increasingly common in the Middle and Late Archaic periods (Thurmond 1990: Table 8; Jones et
al. 1993:41-43; Cliff and Hunt 1995:24-25). The
succeeding Woodland (i.e., Early Ceramic) period
is not formally identified in the corridor but is regionally associated with ceramics, houses, hamlets, and villages indicative of more permanent
occupations, as well as cemeteries and mounds
(Cliff and Hunt 1995:25; Perttula and Nathan
1989:20-21). Caddo (more generically, Late Prehistoric) site types recorded in the corridor include
individual farmsteads or houses, hamlets, villages,
mounds, a cemetery, a midden, and open campsites. As with Archaic period sites, Formative (or
Initial), Middle, and Late Caddo distinctions are
not frequently made, but elsewhere pottery types
are considered diagnostic (Thurmond 1990: Table
8). Changing demographic patterns may be indicated in the appearance of larger cemeteries and
villages in the Late Caddo period (Cliff and Hunt
1995:27; Perttula 2004b:396-407). Site 41TT643
within the corridor is identified as a Late Caddo
cemetery of the Titus phase.
Of the 27 sites representing or including
historic components, most are identified as farmsteads of late nineteenth and twentieth century
date, although an earlier pioneer establishment is
indicated at 41LR131. These sites usually contain artifacts such as ceramics (e.g., crockery and
whiteware), metal objects, and glass, and sometimes yield structural remains or materials such
as wood, brick, nails, and window glass indicating the former presence of buildings. Subsurface
features such as root cellars and wells are occasionally recorded. Where evidence of structures is
absent, sites may be identified as historic dumps.
Three historic cemeteries (41CS137, 41MX27, and
41MX32) are of nineteenth and twentieth century
date; site 41MX27 is an African-American family
burial plot and is the oldest (1868-1973) of these
resources. An historic standing structure, a farmhouse, is reported at 41LR130. A group of buildings designated 41CS192 at the town of O’Farrell
reportedly no longer exist (Young 1984).

Eligibility to the NRHP has yet to be determined for 68 (60.7 percent) of the archeological
sites documented in the project corridor (listed as
“not assessed” in Table 5.2). For reasons of poor
physical integrity and an inability to contribute
to future research questions, nineteen sites (17.0
percent) are considered by their investigators to be
not eligible for listing to the NRHP, applying the
criteria for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). Two
sites (41CS192 and 41FN001) are reportedly destroyed. One prehistoric site (41CS150) is considered eligible but has not been nominated to the
NRHP, and the remaining 22 sites (20.2 percent)
are considered to be potentially eligible for listing
to the NRHP.
Previously Recorded Cemeteries
In addition to the four archeological sites recorded as cemeteries that are mentioned above,
39 extant cemeteries occur within 1.6 km (1.0
mi) of the proposed project corridor (Table 5.3).
While the Texas Historic Site Atlas only formally lists three of these resources (LR-C001, LRC003, and TT-C001) as Texas Historic Cemeteries, most of those listed meet the criteria required
for Historic Cemetery status (Rules of the Texas
Historical Commission, Texas Government Code
Chapter 442), in that they are more than 50 years
old and appear to possess historical significance.
Landscape Distributions of Known Archeological Sites
The landform position (upland, valley slope,
or valley floor) of previously recorded sites within
the 1.6 km (1 mi) of the proposed pipeline corridor is summarized in Table 5.4, sorted by the
major drainage basin in which they lie. Upland
sites comprise 26.6 percent (n=29) of all cultural
resources within the sample, and the great majority of these occur within the Sulphur Creek basin
(including both the Sulphur River and White Oak
Creek drainages). This concentration owes much
to survey coverage bias, namely the focus of intensive archeological survey projects along large portions of White Oak Creek (Cliff and Beene 1990;
Cliff and Peter 1992; Perttula and Nathan 1989).
Low site density for all periods within the Cypress
Basin has been attributed to the low frequency and
intensity of investigations, and probably does not

accurately reflect archeological settlement patterns (Perttula 2004b:396). Reservoir projects,
with their focus on valley resources at risk of inundation, introduce a further bias affecting known
upland site distributions (Thurmond 1990:220,
Table 53). The number of historic components in
upland settings (n=21) does not greatly exceed that
of prehistoric components (n=15), yet the figures
represent 74 and 18.2 percent, respectively, of sites
within these classes. A tendency for historic sites
to occur in upland or upper valley settings likely
reflects cultural preference, in that prairie parcels
found in elevated areas could be more easily converted to farm or range land than lowland forests
(Perttula and Nathan 1989:43-44). Access to roads
and trails was also an important factor in selecting farmstead parcels (Jones et al. 1993:517-518),
as was a general aversion to swampy, mosquitoinfested bottomlands.
The small percentage of prehistoric sites previously recorded in upland settings of the project
corridor consist mostly of campsites of unknown
cultural affiliation. Findings elsewhere in northeast Texas suggest that the earliest occupations
(i.e., Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic) may be well
represented on Pleistocene terraces high above
major streams and are sometimes associated with
upland lithic resources (Cliff and Hunt 1995;
Perttula 2004b; Perttula and Nathan 1989). Sites
of these periods are also present on valley slope
landforms, such as ridge benches, but cannot occur on low Holocene terraces that postdate them
(Waters 1992:151). Sites of Middle and Late Archaic date are relatively abundant in interior upland areas, notably in the vicinity of springs and
lithic procurement sources (Perttula 2004b; Thurmond 1990: Table 53; Albert 1984). Woodland
sites are not represented in the project corridor,
but elsewhere appear to favor valley environments

(Thurmond 1990: Table 53). With their wide range
of more permanent edifices (e.g., houses, villages,
cemeteries, mounds) Caddo period communities
are highly visible in the archeological record, yet
also appear to have focused their activities in valley settings. Exceptions include an Early Caddo
mound (41WD16) and a Late Caddo cemetery
(41HS3) in uplands of the Cypress Basin; the latter site occupies an interfluvial divide (Thurmond
1990:17), an upland formation of high site potential (see Natural Setting).
Most previously recorded sites in the project
area are situated in valley settings (n=83, 74 percent), and as with upland resources, the majority
of these are recorded in the Sulphur River Basin
(see Table 5.4). Nearly two-thirds of the Sulphur
Basin sites are located within the White Oak Creek
drainage. As noted above, these distributions are
largely a function of survey frequency and intensity. Basin wide, sites are best represented on ridge
benches that protrude from valley slopes, followed
by alluvial landforms situated on valley floors.
Most of these manifestations are of prehistoric
date. Although Paleo-Indian lifeways probably
focused on resources within major river valleys,
most components of this period within northeast
Texas are represented by isolated finds of uncertain context (Perttula 2004b:373-374). Save occasional exposures of relict Pleistocene terraces
within valley floors, buried sites rarely occur. The
same is true for Early Archaic sites in stream valleys, which are generally very deeply buried in alluvial terraces. Middle and Late Archaic sites may
be visible in a variety of valley contexts, including
low terraces, upland projections of valley slopes,
and elevated floodplain features (Jones et al.
1993). Occupations are for the most part restricted
to major stream valleys in the earlier period, but
proliferate and expand into smaller drainages in

Perttula and Nathan 1989; Albert 1984). Caddo
village and hamlet sites, and associated cemeteries, occur in most settings until the 1600s, when
the introduction of infectious diseases by European immigrants decimated local populations (Perttula and Nathan 1989). Mound sites are present,
but are not as numerous as in other Caddo centers
to the north and south. Large community cemeteries that first appear during the Late Caddo Titus
phase may result from higher mortality rates with
European contact (Perttula 2004b:400). The area
appears to be largely abandoned by the mid-1600s,
and remains so until the arrival of European traders in the late 18th century. Historic Caddo villages
are known only within the Sulphur and Red Rivers
(Perttula and Nathan 1989). Anglo settlers and immigrant tribes including the Alabama, Cherokee,
Choctaw, Delaware, and Shawnee settled along
the Sulphur River in the 1800s. The application of
this data to the research design and field survey of
the current Phase I field investigation is presented
in the following chapter.

the latter: an indication of the ubiquity of Late Holocene alluvial surfaces within the region (Perttula
2004b). Sites of Woodland and Early, Middle, and
Late Caddoan periods can all be found on the full
range of valley landforms, including rims, slope
projections, alluvial terraces, and sandy floodplain
rises. Within the Red River valley, abandoned meander belts and natural levees are high potential
for the location of Late Prehistoric sites (Albert
1984; Davis 1962a, 1962b; Perttula 2004b).
Studies cited above indicate that site formation processes limit both the occurrence and visibility of Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic manifestations in the greater northeast Texas region.
Middle and Late Archaic sites are more visible, in
part because of abundant burned rock features at
these sites, but also because the Holocene surfaces
containing them are more accessible. A drop in the
frequency of Woodland period sites is unexplained
in the project corridor, but a few sites of this period
are documented elsewhere in the Cypress, Sulphur,
and Red River basins (Thurmond 1990: Table 53;

RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODOLOGIES

T

his chapter describes the research design
and field methodologies that were used
to complete the current Phase I cultural
resources survey and archeological inventory of
the proposed Gulf Crossing Project. It presents
the results of the Texas portion of the undertaking,
which crosses through portions of Grayson, Fannin, Lamar, Delta, Hopkins, Franklin, Titus, Morris, and Cass Counties. In addition, this chapter
describes the procedures utilized in conducting
the associated lithic and historic materials analysis. Finally, it provides the name and address of
the facility where the project notes and materials
will be curated.

The research goals were to identify and to
evaluate all known and unidentified cultural resources that are situated within the proposed Areas of Potential Effect (APE) and which could be
impacted adversely by the proposed undertaking. Cultural resources can include archeological
sites, cultural resources loci, standing structures,
cemeteries, and traditional cultural properties.
All work was performed in accordance with the
procedures outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended; the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974;
the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of
1979, as amended; and Title 36 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and 800, as appropriate. Additionally, this survey effort abided
by the standards set forth in Archeology and Historic Preservation: The Secretary of the Interior’s
Guidelines, and with guidelines contained within
the Texas Historical Commission’s Preserving
Our Heritage: A Statewide Plan for Texas. Information provided by the Council of Texas Archeologists, the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, the Antiquities Code of Texas, and the
Texas Historical Commission’s Rules of Practice
and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas
was also incorporated.

Research Design
The current Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory was designed
to obtain data pertaining to the nature and distribution of all cultural resources located within
the proposed project right-of-way, access roads
and ancillary facilities. Fieldwork for this investigation was comprehensive in nature; planning
took into account the results of archeological surveys previously completed within the immediate
project vicinity, as well as an assessment of the
probabilities for encountering cultural resources
within each survey item. Survey included onground inspection of all portions of each project
item; methodology included pedestrian survey
throughout the proposed Areas of Potential Effect
along with systematic shovel testing at landforms
with the potential for buried cultural deposits. A
research design that encompassed the original
pipeline design was presented to the staff of the
Texas Historical Commission for comment and
review prior to fieldwork being initiated. The
same investigation format was applied to all project changes that occurred after that submission,
for example, alterations to the pipeline route that
were made by field engineers.

Analysis of the Areas of Potential Effect
Prior to initiating the field survey, the potential for identifying intact archeological deposits
within the Areas of Potential Effect was assessed.
Traditionally, environmental factors such as elevation above the surrounding terrain, slope, accessibility to lithic resources, and proximity to
perennial water sources have been used to develop site predictive models. These models often are
used to stratify a particular project area into high,
moderate, and low probability areas for containing archeological sites. The use of such analytical
devices is seen as a means of maximizing the ef88

Chapter VI: Research Design and Field Methodologies
ficiency of a cultural resources survey. In theory,
this approach should result in the identification
and recordation of a greater number of archeological sites, since a more intensive sampling strategy is employed in those areas that exhibit the
highest probabilities for containing intact cultural
deposits.
The predictive model utilized to survey the
currently proposed pipeline route was designed
to provide complete and thorough coverage of all
accessible portions of the Areas of Potential Effect. While the project was divided into high and
low probability areas, this investigation included
pedestrian survey and systematic shovel testing
within all accessible and undisturbed landforms
along the entire length and width of the proposed
project route; only the shovel testing interval
varied between probability areas. Coverage of
the entire project route was adopted for a variety
of reasons. While models are useful in predicting archeological site locations, those field methodologies that greatly reduce coverage through
sampling, or that “write-off” areas considered to
have a low probability for containing archeological sites, risk underestimating the distribution of
archeological resources within a given area. Most
archeologists would agree that predictive models
encompassing the environmental variables outlined above would predict adequately the locations of fairly large camps, habitation sites, and
villages; however, they are less effective in predicting the locations of special use or resource
procurement sites. These sites often had restrictive uses; therefore, their distribution will be tied
to specific resources or to particular environmental niches. Thus, the distribution of such sites
cannot be predicted adequately using only the
previously discussed environmental variables.
As a result, field methodologies that fail to
examine large portions of a project area simply
because they do not possess the characteristics
outlined in a specific predictive model risk missing those sites that have the potential to provide
important information regarding task or resource
procurement activities. These smaller sites can
provide useful information regarding human adaptation to their overall environment; large tracts
or corridors should not be ignored simply because the environmental characteristics strongly

suggest that permanent occupation of an area was
restricted. Furthermore, sampling of low probability areas provides the opportunity for empirical confirmation of predictive models. Failure to
do so assures the success of such models only as
self-fulfilling prophecy. For the Gulf Crossing
Project, locations of previously identified cultural resources were, naturally, always examined
as locations with High archeological potential.
Within the remainder of the extensive corridor,
determination of the specific testing regime to be
employed was made by the field supervisor based
on the types of landforms and disturbances encountered. That determination took into account
the known physiographic aspects of the terrain
and the distribution of known sites within the region. These attributes were presented within the
scope of work document that was submitted to
the Texas Historical Commission, but also is repeated below.
Physiography, Geology, and Hydrology
The proposed project corridor is situated
within the Interior Coastal Plains and Blackland
Prairie physiographic provinces (Figure 1 in Ferring 2007). Counties at the eastern end of the
project area (Cass, Morris, Titus, Franklin) fall
within the Interior Coastal physiographic section, while the western portion (Lamar, Fannin,
and Grayson Counties) lies within the Blackland
Prairie physiographic section. The division between these physiographic provinces conforms to
the distribution of Tertiary-age shales, siltstones,
sandstones, and coals (Wilcox/Midway and Claiborne Groups) in the east, and fine-grained Upper
Cretaceous marl and chalk bedrock in the west
(Barnes 1979).
From east to west, the proposed pipeline
corridor traverses three major drainage basins
in Texas: Cypress Creek, Sulphur River (including White Oak Creek), and the Red River. Within
the project corridor, the contact between Tertiary
and Cretaceous rocks occurs in the Sulphur River
Basin of southwestern Red River County, near
the confluence of the Sulphur River and Brushy
Creek. Quaternary alluvium is concentrated along
stream valleys, with relict Pleistocene terraces preserved in only a few major streams in each basin:
the Red River and Bois D’Arc Creek in the Red

River Basin, Sulphur River and White Oak Creek
in the Sulphur River Basin, and Bee Creek / Johns
Creek and Bayou Creek in the Cypress Creek Basin (Albert 1984; Barnes 1979).
Bedrock outcrops of stone suitable for stone
tool manufacture are extremely rare within the Interior Gulf Coastal Plain, scarcity leading to heavy
reliance on ancient alluvial gravel deposits (Banks
1990:49). Knappable stone rarely occurs in the
Tertiary bedrock that underlies the Cypress Creek
Basin: cobbles of low-quality orthoquartzite are
present in Quaternary alluvial deposits and in outcrops of the Queen City Formation; silicified wood
and ferruginous pigments in the Wilcox Group;
sandstone suitable for ground stone tool manufacture in the Sparta and Reklaw Formations; and
green and brown pigments commonly found in
Caddoan graves in the Weches Formation (Thurmond 1990:12-13). The availability of knappable
stone increases within the Sulphur and Red River
basins. Pleistocene terraces and gravel bars within
the Red and Sulphur Basins contain large clasts of
knappable stone (Cliff and Hunt 1995:8). Tertiary
gravel deposits believed to be erosional remnants
of a vast pediment surface that once extended from
the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of Mexico, and
lithologically similar to the Ogallala Formation of
the High Plains, mantle the upland divide ridges between the Red and Sulphur Rivers, and the Sulphur
River and White Oak Creek (Banks 1990:56-57).
Unmapped deposits of upland lag gravels containing lithic materials from Oklahoma and Arkansas
also have been mapped within the uplands of the
Sulphur River basin (Banks 1990:56-57; Cliff and
Hunt 1995:8). In eastern Texas, gravel veneers on
upland surfaces are often referred to as the Uvalde
gravels, or Uvalde equivalents (Banks 1990:56).
The exploitation of specialized resources, such as
lithic raw materials, may result in archeological
sites in upland areas that otherwise might otherwise be classified as a low probability setting.

crete biotic zones (Perttula 2004a). Bottomland
communities along major drainages (Red, Sulphur, White Oak Creek) once contained diverse
hardwood forests with slackwater meander belts
rich in aquatic resources (Perttula 2004b:370371). Within the proposed corridor, there is a
zone of high archaeological site density associated with a relict meander belt south of Terry Lake
on the South Sulphur River floodplain.
Soils
The Blackland Prairie is well-known for deep
soils ultrarich in clay derived from fine-grained
Cretaceous marine sediments. Due to deformational processes associated with high clay content, site deposits formed in Houston Black Clay,
the prevalent soil series in the Blackland Prairie,
tend to be highly disturbed. Ultraclay soils exhibit extreme plasticity, deep, vertical cracking, and
a propensity to roll like a slowly boiling liquid, or
bread dough when it is kneaded. This movement
produces patterned ground microfeatures known
as gilgai (Collins 2004:108). Soils described as
gilgai clays signify potential for severe subsurface
disturbance capable of destroying the integrity
of archaeological sites. Dense clay soils are also
poorly suited to cultivation with a prehistoric toolkit, and were likely avoided by prehistoric maize
horticulturalists (Cliff and Hunt 1995:9). Wetland
(hydric) soils are common soil types associated
with northeastern Texas floodplains. Hydric soils
form under conditions of saturation, flooding, or
ponding long enough during the growing season
to develop redoximorphic features characteristic
of anaerobic conditions. Under natural conditions,
hydric soils are either saturated or inundated long
enough during the growing season to support the
growth and reproduction of hydrophitic vegetation (Federal Register 1994, 2002; USDA 2006).
Both clay soils susceptible to gilgai movement
and hydric soils have low potential for yielding
intact evidence of prehistoric occupation.
In contrast, sandy soils are well-suited to
prehistoric horticultural methods and technologies. Sandy loam and loam soils dominate in
the Sulphur and Cypress Creek Basins where
they formed on ancient coastal sediments, and
within the thick deposits of Quaternary alluvium
that blanket the Red River valley. Most prehis-

toric sites in the White Oak Creek drainage are

the drainage channel. The hill slope profile may
take on a number of geometric configurations,
depending upon the differences among its components (i.e., length, width, gradient, concavity
etc.). In addition, because the processes which affect hill slopes are controlled directly by gravity,
a steeper (high angle) slope will have a more rapidly changing appearance than one with a shallow
(low angle) gradient.
Geoarchaological investigations of the B-2
survey area in Titus County assessed the potential for buried sites on the upland divide between
White Oak Creek and the Cypress Creek Basin
(Jones et al. 1993:517). Sites in upland settings
are often assumed to exhibit reduced integrity
because of erosion and deflation. Many archaeological sites discovered in the B-2 uplands were
disturbed by either human activities associated
with deforestation or accelerated colluvial processes resulting from the removal of the protective vegetative cover (Jones et al. 1993:20).
However, under certain conditions, thick sandy
mantles (>100 cm) may bury archaeological sites
in upland settings (Jones et al. 1993:517). Sites
located on valley rims or low angle slopes also
may be susceptible to burial by eolian or colluvial sand deposits. In fact, sandy, low angle slopes
overlooking swampy floodplains have been postulated as ideal settings for the garden plots of
Native American horticulturalists (Cliff and Hunt
1995:10). The very nature of this dynamic environment, coupled with effects of local deforestation and subsequent erosion, complicates development of a reliable predictive model for upland
and valley edge settings (Jones et al. 1993:517).

Uplands
Much of the proposed project corridor lies
within dissected uplands characterized by ridge
and ravine topography. The variable resistance of
the structure and lithology of the underlying bedrock to erosional processes controls the locations
of drainages and ridges within this topography.
The hill slope is a geologically dynamic landform that occurs within upland ridge and ravine
topography. The hill slope forms through erosion,
deposition, or a combination of these processes,
and may be further altered by weathering, erosion, sedimentation, and mass movement. At the
head of drainages, a head slope has a concave
form with arms converging downward to the
drainage. Side slopes bound the drainageway in a
linear pattern, and opposed side slopes descend to
valley bottoms. Adjacent drainageways are separated by interfluves, which form the summit of a
hill slope profile. Within the Cypress Creek Basin, reliable freshwater springs are located along
the edges of interfluvial divides at the heads of
drainages (Thurmond 1990:12-13); Uvalde gravels mantle divide ridges in the Sulphur and Red
River Basins. These features make interfluves
high probability settings for prehistoric archaeological sites. Below the summit, the convex portion of the hill slope profile is known as the shoulder, followed by the back slope. The back slope
area of a hill slope is most susceptible to erosion,
chemical and mechanical weathering and transportation of material by mass movement. Cultural resources are least likely to be contained here
because the high slope angles are too great to permit settlement. The foot slope is located below
the back slope and forms a concave structure. The
foot slope is still subject to mass movement, but
receives erosional sediments from above, and a
colluvial fan may form here (Gerrard 1981:11).
The toe slope occurs next with a flattening gradient, descending gently to the drainage floor. The
toe slope may receive both erosional sediments
from the hill slope, and alluvial sediments from

Landscape Distribution of Previously Recorded
Archaeological Sites
Table 5.2 of the previous chapter summarized
the distribution of previously recorded sites located within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the proposed corridor
in relation to their landform position and drainage
basin. The majority of previously recorded sites in
the project area (n=95, 84.8 percent) are located
within the Sulphur River Basin. Nearly two-thirds
of the Sulphur Basin sites (n=60, 63.2 percent)
are located within the White Oak Creek drainage,
a major tributary of the Sulphur River. The high
frequency of sites along White Oak Creek appar91

ently corresponds to a cluster of intensive surveys that paralleled large sections of that drainage (Cliff 1994; Cliff et al. 1992; Cliff and Peter
1992; Perttula and Nathan 1989), complemented
by fieldwork by Milton Bell, an archaeologist
employed for many years by the Texas State Department of Highways and Transportation (Jones
et al. 1993:37). Most sites within the White Oak
Creek basin buffer zone (n=50, 79.4 percent) are
located on alluvial landforms situated on valley
floors (n=16, 27.1 percent), or on upland projections that protrude from valley slopes (n=32, 53.3
percent). Upland sites recorded within the project
buffer zone comprise 20.3 percent (n=12) of the
White Oak Creek sample, but were slightly more
common (n=38/131, 29.0 percent) in a large area
survey project located at the southern edge of the
basin (Jones et al. 1988:501). Route location has
a major impact on relative site density and landform preference data: unlike the Cypress Basin
where large stretches of dissected uplands are
traversed, the proposed corridor parallels major
valleys in the Sulphur Basin. In comparison, a
basin-wide study of archaeological site distributions in the Cypress Basin found that prehistoric
sites located on valley floors (floodplains, rises,
and alluvial terraces) and valley edges (upland
projections and slopes) account for 97.8 percent
(n=514 total) of chronologically classifiable components (Thurmond 1990:220).
Approximately 53 sites (47.3 percent) are
situated within 200 m (656 ft) of natural waterbodies (i.e., defined stream, bayou, lake, and rivers) (Table 6.1). Of the remainder, a total of 28
sites (25.0 percent) are positioned between 200
and 400 m (656 and 1312 ft) from the above waterbodies, while 31 sites (27.7 percent) are located
more than 400 m (1312 ft) away from water. The
utility of simple distance to water calculations as
a means of predicting site locations in northeastern Texas has been challenged by studies based
on intensive pedestrian survey of large area tracts
slated for coal-mining (Jones et al. 1993:497515; Thurmond 1990:16-17). Studies of site distributions recorded during large area surveys at
the Monticello surface coal mine in Titus County
demonstrate that site density is highly variable between drainage basins. Data tabulated during the
site records review for the present project tends

to support this observation. Due to lateral channel
migration, all sites located within the Red River
Basin (n=6) are now in excess of 400 m (1312
ft) from water (see below). Sites within the Cypress Basin and Sulphur River drainage are more
equitably distributed than sites in the White Oak
Creek drainage, which occur within 200 m (656
ft) of water more frequently than expected. Visual
inspection suggests these data are spatially conditioned by the parallel or perpendicular orientation of the proposed survey corridor relative to
the drainages located along the pipeline transect.
Areas of low archaeological site density
within the Cypress Basin of northeastern Texas
and northwestern Louisiana have been characterized as a function of survey frequency and intensity rather than as a reliable indication of prehistoric settlement patterns (Perttula 2004b:396;
Thurmond 1990:31). Most survey work within
that basin has been associated with reservoir projects, with the result that most sites are associated
with stream valleys (Thurmond 1990:220, Table
53). With the exception of a few large pipeline
survey projects, the same can be said for most of
northeastern Texas. Coupled with the Monticello
survey results and uneven survey coverage, distributional data compiled from the 1.6 km (1 mi)
buffer suggests that distance to water has little
analytical utility in the development of a sensitivity model for the proposed project corridor (Table
6.1).
Temporal Patterns of Prehistoric Site Distribution
Previous investigations provide qualitative
data regarding site locations within the project
corridor. Paleo-Indian sites and isolated findspots
are rare, but tend to be associated with Pleistocene
terraces (T-2, T-3) in major streams such as the
Red and Sulphur Rivers, or near upland outcrops
of lithic resources (Cliff and Hunt 1995; Perttula 2004; Perttula and Nathan 1989). In general,
these contexts reflect stable upland surfaces with
minimal erosion and deposition, and maximum
visibility. Paleo-Indian sites in buried context
are much less common. In a study of the Cypress
Creek Basin, Paleo-Indian sites and isolated finds
(n=40 total) occur most frequently on floodplain
rises and alluvial terraces on major valley floors,

or the surface of upland projections overlooking
valley floors (Thurmond 1990:Table 53).
Early Archaic sites, also rare, are found deeply buried in alluvial landforms in major stream
valleys, on upland projections and slopes (valley
edges), or interior uplands (Jones et al. 1993; Perttula 2004; Perttula and Nathan 1989; Thurmond
1990:Table 53).
Middle Archaic sites are found in major
stream valleys buried in alluvial landforms, on
the surfaces of alluvial terraces, upland projections and slopes (valley edges), or interior upland
surfaces (Jones et al. 1993; Perttula 2004; Perttula
and Nathan 1989; Thurmond 1990:Table 53). Middle Archaic sites occur less commonly in smaller
tributaries, at drainage headwaters, and near confluences (Perttula 2004). Burned rock features are
a common Middle Archaic site type.
Late Archaic sites are common in stream valleys of all sizes and in many uplands settings (Jones
et al. 1993). The high frequency of Late Archaic
and later components reflects the relative stability and ubiquity of Late Holocene surfaces within
the study area. In the Red River valley, Late Archaic sites are associated with floodplains, springs,
spring-fed drainages, ridges, and tributary valleys
of major streams (Albert 1984; Perttula 2004). In
the Sulphur Basin, Late Archaic sites are common
in buried alluvial contexts, and valley edges (upland projections and slopes) (Cliff and Hunt 1995
Perttula 2004; Perttula and Nathan 1989). In the

common on valley edges, followed by alluvial terraces and floodplain rises (Thurmond 1990:Table

houses, middens, and lithic procurement. Early
Ceramic occupations are poorly documented in
the Cypress Basin, but are most often found at
valley edges on upland projections and slopes,
and less often on floodplain rises or alluvial terraces (Thurmond 1990:Table 53). In the Sulphur
and Red River Basins, Early Ceramic sites are
found on alluvial terraces, sandy interfluves,
floodplains, and near springs (Albert 1984; Perttula and Nathan 1989; Perttula 2004).
Formative to Middle Caddoan site types include houses, pits, other features, cemeteries, burials, middens, mounds, villages, hamlets and farmsteads. Sites are most common in major valleys and
spring-fed minor tributaries on elevated landforms
(alluvial terraces, floodplain rises, natural levees,
upland valley projections and valley rims) in association with well-drained loamy soils (Perttula and
Nathan 1989; Perttula 2004). In the Red River valley, sites are associated with abandoned meander
belts on floodplains, natural levees, and alluvial
terraces (Davis 1962a, 1962b; Perttula 2004). In
the Sulphur Valley, Caddoan sites have been found
on upland valley rims, upland projections, T-1 terraces, and sandy floodplain rises (Cliff and Hunt
1995; Perttula and Nathan 1989; Perttula 2004).
Within Sulphur River tributaries, sites are found
less frequently in upper drainage sections relative
to middle and lower sections (Cliff 1994:209).
Early-Middle Caddoan sites in the Cypress Basin
occur equally in valley edge settings (upland projections and slopes), and valley floors (alluvial terraces, floodplain rises, and floodplains). One Early
Caddoan mound (41WD16) was found high in the
uplands of the western Cypress Basin (Thurmond
1990:17).
Late Caddoan sites include large villages,
small hamlets, large cemeteries, and small mounds.

Phase sites occur at valley edge settings (upland
projections and slopes), on alluvial terraces, and
floodplain rises, floodplains and in uplands (Thurmond 1990:Table 53). The largest Late Caddoan
cemetery (41HS3) identified within the Cypress
Creek Basin lies just below an interfluvial divide
high in the uplands (Thurmond 1990:17). Late
Caddoan sites are common in the Middle and Upper sections of White Oak Creek and the Sulphur
River (Perttula and Nathan 1989; Perttula 2004).
Late Caddoan sites in the Red River Basin are associated with meander belts and abandoned channel levees (Perttula and Nathan 1989; Perttula
2004).
The region was largely depopulated during
the 1600s following the introduction of infectious
diseases by European explorers. Historic Caddoan
villages are known only from the Red and Lower
Sulphur Rivers (Perttula and Nathan 1989). Immigrant tribes, including the Choctaw, Delaware,
Cherokee, Alabama, Quapaw, and Shawnee, settled along the Sulphur River in the 1800s; AngloAmericans soon followed.
Historic Euro-American settlement patterns
suggest the earliest settlements were concentrated
along major streams (Cliff and Hunt 1995), early
trails (traces) and roads (Jones et al. 1993:517518). Later settlements are located in uplands far
from swampy, mosquito-infested bottomlands. Of
the 28 historic archaeological sites recorded in the
proposed project corridor, 75 percent (n=21) are
located in upland settings.
Previous studies suggest geomorphic filtering processes limit the occurrence and visibility of
Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic sites in northeastern Texas. Middle and Late Archaic sites are much
more visible, in part due to the prevalence of hot
rock cooking features at sites of these time periods. A dramatic drop in the regional frequency of
Early Ceramic sites in the Cypress Basin relative
to earlier and later cultural complexes remained
unexplained. In contrast, contemporaneous Early
Ceramic site density within the Sulphur River Basin was reportedly quite high. Caddoan hamlets
and village sites proliferate until the introduction
of infectious diseases by Europeans decimates local populations. Small, family cemeteries are typically found in association with Caddoan habitation
sites. Mound sites occur, but are less common than

in other Caddoan centers to the south and north.
Large communal cemeteries that first appear during the Titus Phase apparently relate to increased
native mortality due to European contact (Perttula
2004:400). By the mid-1600s, the area is largely
abandoned, and remains so until the arrival of Anglo and Spanish traders in the 1790s, and immigrant tribes and settlers around 1800.
Sensitivity Model
As a result of in situ erosion, agricultural or
other modern developments (i.e., pipeline construction, coal-mining, oil field development)
within the study area, the entire record of human
occupation along the project corridor could easily
be disturbed or destroyed. Because archeological
deposits are often restricted to the surface or near
surface in these areas, even a shallow disturbance
of its surface will impact severely any archeological materials that may be present. All collocated
sections of the proposed pipeline corridor should
be scrutinized carefully for evidence of prior disturbance. In the Black Marlin, Liberty, and Southern Interconnect pipeline surveys, the corridor surveyed was generally only 15.2-22.9 m (50-75 ft) in
width.
Within the Cypress Basin, highly dissected
uplands comprise nearly all of the terrain traversed
by the proposed corridor. Some evidence suggests
single component sites might occur more frequently in upland settings, and that these sites have
more analytical potential than multicomponent
sites (Thurmond 1990:220). Intensive reoccupation of preferred landforms is the norm rather than
the exception, and diagnostic artifact frequencies
suggest that multi-component sites were utilized
more intensively over time (Thurmond 1990:236237). Unless such sites are well-stratified, they are
unlikely to be recommended for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Therefore, pedestrian surveys should avoid sampling biases that
favor valley-specific landforms and larger drainages. The analytical utility of the low site density and
high proportionate frequency of single-component
sites along minor watercourses and in upland areas
argues strongly in favor of careful examination of
such areas within the project corridor (Thurmond
1990:237). Given the potential for tight chronological resolution, even surface sites in these set94

ting have the potential to be recommended as eligible for the NRHP. The potential for sites buried
in eolian and dune sand deposits suggests the need
for placement of low intensity shovel tests in sandy areas despite conditions of good ground surface
visibility.
A series of valley-focused Sulphur Basin surveys identified several high probability settings,
including: 1) flat, upland edges or benches in close
proximity to what may have been at the time the
channel of the Sulphur River or White Oak Creek;
2) rises composed of eroded upland material, or
overbank levee features adjacent to what may
have been at the time the channel of the Sulphur
River or White Oak Creek; and 3) ridges adjacent
to and rises within the broad valleys of relatively
large tributary creeks of both the Sulphur River
and White Oak Creek (Cliff 1994:200). Within
these areas, there appears to have been a preference for sandy loam or loam soils over clay or clay
loam soils. Surveys of the upper reaches of several
major tributaries of the Sulphur / White Oak Creek
basin suggest sites are preferentially located close
to small permanent streams on moderately sloping
or level uplands overlooking the creeks as close
as possible to water without possibility of flooding. Sites that do occur within narrow floodplains
of tributary streams are situated on low, sandy
rises. Loams, silt loams, and sandy loams are the
preferred soil associations in these settings (Cliff
1994:206). Stream valleys within the Sulphur Basin, especially White Oak Creek and other streams
situated on Tertiary bedrock, probably represent
the best opportunity to locate buried archeological
sites within the project corridor. Intensive shovel
testing of sandy alluvial and colluvial landforms,
supplemented with augering and possibly backhoe trenching, is highly recommended. However,
subsurface investigations should be minimized in
areas dominated by ultraclay and/or hydric soils.
Surface archeological sites are common on
the surfaces of older Pleistocene-age alluvial terraces (T-2, T-3) and bedrock (Cretaceous) within
the Red River basin, but, unlike the Holocene-age
T1 terrace, the antiquity of the earlier landforms
precludes occurrence of buried cultural materials. These shallowly buried sites are often multicomponent and have little analytical value. A
major Caddoan mound (41FN1), now destroyed,

was located on a T-2 terrace surface within the
proposed corridor buffer. 41FN1 was the westernmost Caddoan mound recorded on the Red River
(Davis 1962a:487-489, 1962b:86). No associated
village was ever located. Sites on the T-1 terrace or
modern floodplain tend to be recent or historic, or
deeply buried. Sources of knappable stone in the
form of large cobbles are available eroding from
ancient terrace fills: such areas are often the focus
of intensive lithic procurement activities, yet without associated diagnostics, attributing these sites
to a cultural affiliation is likely to prove difficult, if
not impossible. High potential settings within the
project corridor in the Red River Basin are likely
to be associated with smaller tributary streams.
Subsurface investigations should be minimized in
areas dominated by ultraclay and hydric soils.
Overall, stream valleys offer the highest potential to locate sites in buried context. Buried sites
are expected to occur in floodplain rises, alluvial
terraces, natural levees, and low angle distal ridge
settings (foot and toe slopes). Uplands, especially
divide ridges, are high probability locations due to
the presence of key resources: freshwater springs in
the Cypress Creek Basin (Thurmond 1990:12-13),
and Uvalde gravels in the Red and Sulphur Basins
(Banks 1990:56-57; Hunt and Cliff 1995:8). Sites
in these settings are potentially significant because
they might yield important chronological information needed for studies of prehistoric settlement
patterns (Perttula 2004). Caddoan cemeteries and
mounds are also known from upland contexts, as
are most historic sites.
The lowest potential locations for sites are
expected at steep slopes, on marshy floodplains,
or active floodplains mantled in recent alluvium.
Areas dominated by clay soils noted for gilgai features should be ranked low in the sensitivity model. Hydric (wetland) soils also have low site potential and should be classified as low sensitivity,
although high site densities along sections of the
Sulphur River, White Oak Creek and tributaries
suggest elevated landforms associated with such
settings should be treated as high probability.
Ridge tops, upland valley rims, upland valley projections, ancient terrace surfaces, and stable
bedrock-controlled surfaces are likely to yield sites
in shallow or deflated context. However, eolian deposits might create conditions favorable to preser95

vation of single component sites of short temporal
duration. These contexts are therefore classified as
intermediate potential.

The vertical accretion of sediments that create alluvial terraces and fill backswamps and
abandoned channels preserves the archeological deposits within these environments. Within a
meandering river system, lateral migration of the
channel also erodes these sediments along with
any enclosed archeological deposits. Until the
abandonment of the river course or channel, the
cutbank of an actively meandering river system
continually erodes the adjacent natural levee and
enclosed archeological deposits. The same lateral
migration of the channel results in the sequential
deposition of sediments on its point bar, providing
an ideal environment for the formation of stratified
sites (Collins 2004:106-107).
A review of USGS 7.5-minute topographic
maps by geomorphologist Dr. Rolfe Mandel of
the Kansas Geological Survey identified sixteen
stream crossings with potential to yield buried archaeological deposits stored within alluvial landforms on valley floors that might require investigation by mechanical deep testing with backhoes or
augers (Table 6.2). Soil survey maps were checked
to identify and exclude crossings dominated by
hydric or ultraclay soils. This procedure resulted
in elimination of most crossings from further consideration.
The Red River floodplain and adjacent T-1 surface is a complex network of abandoned channels,
natural levees, point bar deposits, oxbow lakes,
and sand dunes. These features are characteristics
of a highly variable, sinuous, meandering river
with a wide, active channel belt. Prior deep test
investigations of the T-1 terrace at the Red River
in the general vicinity of the proposed project corridor (Peter et al. 1991) suggest that this landform
is up to 9 meters thick with a surface of less than
1000 years old, with modern floodplain sediments
(<500-700 years old) at least 5 meters thick (Peter
et al. 1991). Extensive backhoe trenching conducted in prior investigations suggests cultural materials buried within the T-1 terrace of the Red River
are either extremely spotty due to the dynamic nature of the floodplain environment, or very deeply
buried. Within the context of this project, the possibility of encountering buried cultural materials
within the floodplain or buried in the T-1 terrace
is quite low, and geoarcheological investigations
within the Red River valley are not recommended

Potential for Deeply Buried Cultural Deposits
Expanding upon the above discussion, it is apparent that deeply buried cultural materials are possibly located within alluvial deposits within the Area
of Potential Effect. Valleys are comprised of rim,
edge, and floor settings. Rims are upland surfaces
that overlook valley floors. Valley edges may be
lower-elevation projections of upland ridges, ridge
slopes, or elevated features of colluvial or alluvial
origin such as talus cones, colluvial aprons, or alluvial fans. Valley floors are composed of a complex
variety of relict or active geomorphic surfaces that
range in age from Late Pleistocene to Recent Holocene. Because almost every geomorphic surface
exhibits constructional landforms of fluvial origin,
they are considered to be the product of fluvial aggradation which sometimes was separated by periods of fluvial erosion caused by the entrenchment
of the Mississippi River and its tributaries.
The most common geomorphic surfaces found
within the river valleys of northeastern Texas are
meander belts, backswamps, and alluvial terraces.
A meander belt is a surface that consists of all the
area and constructional landforms created by the
meandering of a river while occupying a single
course. A meander belt consists of an assemblage
of related constructional landforms such as point
bars, natural levees, crevasses, abandoned meander loops, and abandoned river courses. A backswamp, also called a “flood basin,” is a geomorphic surface consisting of swamp, lakes, or combination of both lying between meander belts, other
geomorphic, or bedrock-controlled surfaces. The
backswamp consists of depositional environments
that range from infrequently flooded forested bottomlands to permanent swamps and lakes. An alluvial terrace is a relatively flat, relict floodplain
located on either side of the present valley floor
and floodplain, but at a slightly higher elevation.
Alluvial terraces are separated from adjacent geomorphic surfaces by a constructional or erosional
scarp. Multiple alluvial terraces and terrace remnants are common in larger valleys, and within the
project area are especially prominent within the
Red River valley.

eliminated from further consideration.
As indicated in Table 6.2, visual reconnaissance potentially followed by augering and/or
backhoe trenching was recommended to help locate and assess landforms with potential for buried archaeological deposits at several additional
locations, including the confluence of Village and
Plum Creeks in Morris County, selected areas of
White Oak Creek in Titus County, and Mallory
Creek in Lamar County. This reconnaissance was
performed by Dr. Rolfe Mandel in April, 2007.

at this time. However, visual reconnaissance was
recommended (see below).
Annual rainfall provides a constant water
flow within many streams in the Sulphur River
Basin. Rainwater tends to rapidly descend onto
floodplains, pooling in extensive sloughs and
marshes (Cliff and Hunt 1995:10). Two buried paleosols of Late Holocene age (ca. 3500 B.P. and
3000 B.P.) have been detected within the Sulphur
River floodplain in Cass County (Cliff and Hunt

tributary streams within the Sulphur Basin (Cliff

Chapter VI: Research Design and Field Methodologies
Standard Field Methodology
Following the background research summarized above, a Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory of the Areas of
Potential Effect was completed. The field effort
was designed to conform with the guidelines promulgated by the Texas Historical Commission, in
Austin, Texas, the Council of Texas Archeologists Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management Reports and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission’s Office of Energy Projects Guidelines for Reporting on Cultural Resources Investigations for Pipeline Projects (2002).
To facilitate recordation and control during
the survey process, the pipeline route was divided
into arbitrary survey segments. These segments
were defined by the amount of field study that was
conducted each day; it was also limited to contiguous sections where land owners had provided
survey permission. Before survey, each segment
was assigned a unique number and assessed in
terms of its likelihood to contain intact cultural
deposits based on the study of physiographic
data, aerial photographs and known site positions. Wherever possible, the exact geographical
position of the beginning, ending and PI changes
within the survey corridor were recorded using a
Trimble GPS recorder with sub-meter accuracy;
this data was only not recorded when affected by
adverse weather, satellite unavailability or heavy
vegetation that blocked the GPS signal.
Construction of the proposed 42-inch O.D.
pipeline will generally require a 30.5 m (100 ft)
wide construction right-of-way in uplands and a
22.9 m (75 ft) wide construction right-of-way in
wetlands (see Appendix V). The majority of the
proposed Gulf Crossing Project pipeline will parallel existing foreign and Gulf South pipeline. At
these sections, a 18.3 m (60 ft) wide permanent
easement will be retained and an additional 12.2
m (40 ft) of temporary construction right-of-way
will be located on the side opposite from the existing pipeline corridor; the temporary construction right-of-way will be limited to 4.6 m (15
ft) width within wetlands. For the portion of the
proposed pipeline that will not be adjacent to an
existing utility corridor, both the permanent and
temporary construction rights-of-way will re-

main the same size but will be situated to either
side of the proposed centerline. Although Gulf
Crossing only anticipates that a 30.5 m (100 ft)
wide construction right-of-way will be required,
the Phase I cultural resources survey examined
an environmental corridor that was 91.5 m (300
ft) to 106.7 m (350 ft) in width. The extra area
was surveyed to cover any unexpected additional
temporary workspaces that may be required during construction and to enable Gulf Crossing to
make minor changes in the configuration of the
proposed pipeline centerline.
Pedestrian Survey
The Phase I cultural resource inventory study
consisted of pedestrian surface reconnaissance
along the entire length and width of the environmental survey corridor and it was augmented by
a stratified, systematic, subsurface testing regime.
The use of standard survey transects was employed
to assure complete coverage of the proposed pipeline corridor and to control the delineation and recordation of cultural resources that were identified
during the survey. As noted in Chapter II and in the
above research design discussion, agricultural and
other modern developments can easily destroy archeological deposits across the upland and terrace
landscapes. These deposits are generally restricted
to the surface levels of the soil pedon; thus, even
a shallow disturbance will impact severely any
archeological materials that may be present. As a
result, in areas of disturbance such as agricultural
fields where ground surface visibility was greater
than 40 percent, fieldwork within the corridor was
limited to a pedestrian survey. This consisted of
four survey transects spaced 15 to 25 m (49.2 to
82 ft) apart across the proposed corridor (see Figures 6.1 and 6.2). The spacing between transects
was closed in to 10 to 15 m (32.8 to 49.2 ft) at locations where the field of vision was partially obscured, such as at raised corn rows in agricultural
fields. Existing cleared pipeline and transmission
line corridors that lay within or directly adjacent
to the proposed pipeline corridor were also limited
to pedestrian survey, given the occurrence of earlier Phase I investigations and the level of existing
ground disturbance within those areas by repeated
tree harvesting and ground clearing activities.

Shovel Test Placement within Collocated Corridor
The surveyed corridor measured 91.5 m
(300 ft) wide at segments where the proposed
Gulf Crossing Project pipeline was situated directly adjacent (or collocated) to an existing pipeline right-of-way. Shovel tests spaced 100 m (328
ft) apart were systematically excavated within this
corridor when ground surface visibility averaged
less than 40 percent and where the field supervisor believed low archeological site potential was
present. If extensive land disturbance was not
present, two parallel linear transects spaced 50 m
(164 ft) apart were used. The first transect, placed
directly on the proposed centerline, was located
21.3 m (70 ft) from an existing buried pipeline
(Figure 6.1). Shovel tests excavated along adjacent
transects were offset by half the interval to maximize coverage of the Area of Potential Effect.
If poor surface visibility was present but high
archeological site potential was perceived by the
field supervisor, shovel tests were excavated at 50
m (164 ft) intervals along each survey transect,
again offset to maximize survey coverage. As an
additional measure, the shovel testing interval was
further reduced to 25 m (82 ft) when surveying the
plotted position of a known cultural resource. The
reduced interval was initiated by the field crew
when approaching within 100 m (328 ft) of the site
and extended at least 100 m (328 ft) past its plotted
endpoint.
At locations where the proposed pipeline
crosses over to the opposite side of an existing
cleared right-of-way, the same transect configuration was used. At these crossovers, however, the
survey corridor encompassed both sides of the existing right-of-way and extended in length to the
degree necessary to provide full coverage of the
Area of Potential Effect.

percent surface visibility were assessed along
two parallel linear transects spaced 50 m (98.4
ft) apart, using the configuration shown in Figure 6.2. Shovel tests were spaced 100 m (328 ft)
apart on the individual transects and shovel tests
excavated along adjacent transects were offset to
maximize coverage of the Area of Potential Effect.
Sections determined to have High archeological
site potential within the greenfield corridor were
assessed using shovel tests excavated at 50 m (164
ft) intervals along each survey transect, offset to
maximize survey coverage. As above, when approaching within 100 m (328 ft) of the plotted position of a known cultural resource, the shovel testing interval was further reduced to 25 m (82 ft).
All shovel tests excavated during the Phase I
investigation measured at least 30 cm (11.8 in) in
diameter and were excavated to subsoil. In areas
where pre-Holocene sediments could not be established, shovel tests were excavated to a minimum
depth of 50 cmbs (19.7 inbs). All shovel test fill
was screened through 0.64 cm (0.25 in) hardware
cloth except in the event of extremely wet soils or
clay, which were hand-sifted, troweled, and examined visually for cultural material. Field crews
were instructed to excavate each shovel test in 10
cm (3.9 in) artificial levels within natural strata.
Munsell Soil Color Charts were used to record
soil color; soil texture and other identifiable characteristics also were recorded using standard soils
nomenclature. All shovel tests were backfilled
immediately upon completion of the archeological recordation process. Shovel tests generally
were not excavated in areas of greater than 40 percent ground surface visibility, in settings covered
by standing water, in areas of obvious disturbance,
or in areas of high angle slope (>20 percent).
Assessment of Ancillary Facilities
In addition to the proposed pipeline corridor, a number of ancillary project items will be
required to facilitate construction of the currently
proposed pipeline. These facilities include two
compressor stations, two meter and regulation
stations, three contractor warehouse sites, and
access roads. Each of these ancillary use areas
was, or will be in the near future, subjected to
a Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory; the access roads and contrac-

While most of the proposed Gulf Crossing
Project pipeline will be collocated with existing utility rights-of-way, some new right-of-way
will be needed for its construction. The surveyed

tor sites could not be surveyed due to a lack of
survey permission. Fieldwork generally followed
the same methods outlined above, Pedestrian
survey transects were spaced 15 to 25 m (49.2
to 82 ft) apart in areas where visibility exceeded
40 percent, and were spaced 50 m (164 ft) apart
in areas that required shovel testing. Shovel tests
were placed along survey transects at 50 m (164
ft) intervals in areas of high archeological potential and at 100 m (328 ft) intervals in locations
that demonstrate the presence of low archeological potential. If approaching within 100 m (328 ft)
of the plotted position of a known cultural resource,
the shovel testing interval was further reduced to
25 m (82 ft) along each transect.
Additional Phase I cultural resource investigations will be conducted for all remaining unsurveyed portions of the Area of Potential Effects of
the project. These surveys will include all private
access roads that may require upgrades and any
additional temporary work spaces or additional
above-ground facilities that extend outside of
the surveyed environmental corridor. These additional surveys are anticipated to be completed
by July 2007, with the supplemental report sent to
the Texas Historical Commission and FERC by
August 2007.
Access roads required for constructing the
proposed pipeline corridor will generally measure between 3 m (10 ft) and 7 m (23 ft) in width.
The survey corridor for access roads will measure 15.24 m (50 ft) in width. Within existing
non-public roadways, archeological survey will
consist of examining the length of each access
road along two survey transects (TR1 and TR2)
placed to either side of the access road centerline. Visual examination will encompass both the
road surface and the sidewall of the road. Shovel
tests will be generally attempted on substandard
roads characterized by poor surface visibility, i.e.,
where surface visibility drops below 30 percent,
or when the possibility of encountering intact
cultural deposits is likely. Shovel testing also
will be conducted at locations where the use of
an existing road will require realignment or an
expansion beyond its current boundary (e.g., on
sharp curves). In all instances, the survey method
employed, changes in vegetation and topography,
evidence of natural or artificial features, and lo-

cational information will be compiled on access
road recordation forms.
Investigation of Deeply Buried Cultural Deposits
The stream crossings identified in Table 6.2
were visually inspected for landforms suitable
for harboring buried cultural deposits. Deep test
methods will be used to evaluate the presence or
absence of buried paleosols or cultural materials
along the proposed pipeline centerline. The preliminary findings of the geoarcheological reconnaissance are presented in Appendix II; please
note that the figures incorporated into Appendix
II reflect earlier proposed mileposts. For comparative purposes, the two proposed geoarcheological survey areas now correspond to the following:
Choctaw Creek (MP 3.33 to 4.00) and Red River
(MP 41.55 to 44.85). At the time of this report,
follow-up fieldwork consisting of hydraulic coring across warranted alluvial settings has not been
conducted due to lack of access. It will be subject
to an addendum report upon completion of that
aspect of the investigations.
Site Recordation and Delineation
All cultural resources identified during survey
were examined to ascertain the nature, size, depth,
integrity, age, and affiliation of the cultural deposits. Delineation testing also was used to assess the
stratigraphic placement, density, and research potential of each site identified. The information was
gathered to assist in the subsequent assessment of
whether or not a site is considered not significant,
potentially significant, or significant applying the
National Register of Historic Places criteria for
evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). Archeological
recordation generally included a combination of
the following: (1) establishment of a site datum
for mapping purposes; (2) intensive surface reconnaissance of the site area; and (3) excavation
of shovel tests at 25 m (82 ft) intervals along rays
emanating from datum to delineate both the horizontal and vertical extent of the site and its configuration. Following the Texas Historical Commission 2002 survey guidelines, a minimum of six
tests were excavated within and surrounding the
site to determine site boundaries whenever ground
surface visibility was less than 40 percent.

Artifact distributions and the stratigraphic
positions of all artifacts were used to compile each
site description, as well as to support a clear and
concise statement regarding integrity and significance for each cultural resource identified. Finally,
Texas Archeological Site Data Forms were completed and submitted to the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin for all archeological sites identified during the Phase I cultural resources investigation.

and/or color photographs (35mm) were taken of
all built resources 50 years in age or older. Architectural data collected included building form,
building material(s), and decorative features.
Field notes also recorded the character of the
surrounding area, including vegetation present,
overall landscape, and the presence of man-made
obstructions. This information was provided to
architectural historians at R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates to assist them in determining
the National Register eligibility of each structure.

Architectural Field Methods
Survey crews were instructed to record all
standing structures encountered during the cultural resources survey and archeological inventory of
the proposed survey corridor. Since the proposed
undertaking has the potential to impact or destroy
historic properties, the purpose of this architectural recordation was to: (1) collect reconnaissancelevel architectural survey data for each building 50
years in age or older located within or immediately
adjacent to the proposed Areas of Potential Effect;
(2) apply the National Register criteria to each recorded resource to identify potential historic properties; and (3) apply the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation’s Criteria of Effect and Adverse
Effect to each historic property to anticipate the
potential effects of the undertaking.
The architectural survey encompassed the
91.4 m (300 ft) or 106.7 m (350 ft) wide survey
corridors. Since it was anticipated that potential
visual effects might extend beyond the physical
impact area, the Area of Potential Effect for this
aspect of the project was further refined by conditions identified in the field; the visual area under
examination may extend for an additional 50 m
(164 ft) depending upon land access and visibility. Architectural investigations were undertaken
in accordance with guidelines established in National Register Bulletin 24: Guidelines for Local Surveys: A Basis for Preservation Planning.
Where relevant, the information in National Register Bulletin 30: Guidelines for Evaluating and
Documenting Rural Historic Landscapes was also
applied to the investigation.
The architectural survey was accomplished
by inspecting each building encountered along
the proposed project right-of-way as well as in
other Areas of Potential Effect. Black and white

The Criteria of Effect and Adverse Effect (36
CFR 00.9b [1-5]) was employed to define potential
project effects. The Criteria of Effect states that:
00.9 (a)

An undertaking has an effect on a historic property when the undertaking
may alter characteristics of the property that may qualify the property for
inclusion in the National Register. For
the purpose of determining effect, alteration to features of a property’s location, setting, or use may be relevant
depending on a property’s significant
characteristics and should be considered.

Criteria of Adverse Effect states that:
00.9 (b)

An undertaking is considered to have
an adverse effect when the effect on
a historic property may diminish the
integrity of the property’s location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, or association. Adverse effects
on historic properties include, but are
not limited to:
(1)
(2)

(3)

(4)
(5)

Physical destruction, damage, or alteration of all or part of the property;
Isolation of the property from or alteration of the character of the properties
setting when that character contributes
to the property’s qualification for the
National Register;
Introduction of visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that are out of
character with the property or alter its
setting;
Neglect of a property resulting in its
deterioration or destruction; and,
Transfer, lease, or sale of the property.

Laboratory Analysis
Laboratory analysis of all recovered cultural
material followed established archeological protocols. All field specimen bag proveniences first
were cross-checked against the field notes and
the specimens inventoried for accuracy and completeness. Following this quality-control process,
all recovered material were washed by hand, airdried, sorted into basic material categories, and
then encoded into computerized site catalogs to
allow for further manipulation of the data. The nature and structure of the analyses was guided by
the goals of the project. The first requirement of
the research was to determine whether or not a cultural resources locus had the potential to meet the
legal definition of an historic property. Therefore,
particular care was taken to observe and record
chronologically sensitive attributes of historic artifacts, and to evaluate, for example, whether or not
the material is older than 50 years in age.
Beyond the determination of minimum age,
the artifact analysis consisted of making and recording a series of observations for each specimen. The observations were chosen to provide the
most significant and diagnostic information about
each artifact. At least four separate relational databases were used to store, organize, and manipulate
the data generated by the analytical process. These
databases were used to analyze the prehistoric
lithics, prehistoric ceramics, and historic artifacts
recovered during survey. An additional database
was used to analyze faunal remains. The use of the
different databases reflected the differences in the
analytical protocols required to study thoroughly
the different types of material. Non-diagnostic
artifact descriptions were summarized in tabular
form. Photographs and descriptions of chronologically or culturally diagnostic artifacts were taken
for inclusion in this report. Features or artifacts observed but not collected also were noted for inclusion in the report.

erally accepted classifications. The third and fourth
levels, type and subtype, described the temporally
and/or functionally diagnostic artifact attributes.
The identification of artifacts is generally aided by
consulting standard reference works (e.g., Coates
1990; Fike 1987; Florence 1990; Lockhart 2006;
Kovel and Kovel 1986; Markell et al. 1999; Miller et al. 2000; Toulouse 1969, 1971).
Prehistoric Lithic Analysis
The lithic analysis protocol used in this
project is a “technological” or “functional” one
designed to identify prehistoric reduction trajectories, lithic industries, and tool functions. The
protocol therefore focused on recording technological characteristics of the recovered lithic artifacts. The lithic artifact database was organized
by lithic material group, type, and subtype. The
first level described the raw material type of the
artifact (Banks 1990). Lithic materials were identified through recognized geological descriptions
and terminology; where possible this was confirmed through the use of type specimens from a
known source. Lithic raw materials were divided
into distinct categories based on four factors: texture, color, translucence, and the presence or absence of cobble cortex, which can be indicative of
secondary procurement. The second analysis level, type, was used to define the general class, e.g.,
unmodified flake, core, or preform, of lithic artifact, while the last level, subtype, was employed
to specify morphological attributes, e.g., primary
cortex, extensively reduced, or corner-notched.
Typological identifications for temporally and regionally diagnostic tools also were included in the
analysis; such identifications were made through
reference to established local and regional lithic
artifact typologies (Bousman et al. 2004; Collins
2004; Turner and Hester 1999).
Prehistoric Ceramic Analysis
The prehistoric ceramic taxonomy was organized by type, variety, surface decoration, aplastic
inclusions, and vessel portion. The database was
designed to allow the analyst to record established
ceramic types, as well as ceramic modes and attributes. The first level, type, represented the established named ceramic types according to local and
regional published sources (Perttula 1992, 2004b;

Historic/Modern Cultural Material Analysis
The analysis of the historic/modern cultural
material was organized by class, functional group,
type, and subtype. The first level, class, represented the material category, e.g., ceramic, glass, or
metal. The second level, functional group (e.g., architecture, kitchen, or personal) was based on gen105

Chapter VI: Research Design and Field Methodologies
Suhm and Jelks 1962; Thurmond 1990). The second level, variety, was used to identify, where possible, the named ceramic variety according to published typologies. The decoration entry described
the basic type of surface decoration present on
the sherd, e.g., plain, brushed, engraved, ridged,
or incised. The aplastic inclusion category listed
the principal temper types observed in the paste of
each sherd. Aplastic inclusion combinations (e.g.,
sand/grog) were used to denote only the nominal
presence of those inclusions, not the ordinal dominance of one aspect over the other. The vessel portion column listed the portion of the ceramic vessel
from which the sherd was derived. Possible values
in this field included, for example, body, rim, base,
neck/collar and so forth.

tory. These assessments were made in accordance
with the NRHP criteria for evaluation (36 CFR
60.4 [a-d]). This draft report was then written to
present the results of this investigation; it will be
submitted to the Texas Historical Commission
and FERC for review. Once editorial comments
are received from these agencies, they will be incorporated into the draft report and a final report
will be produced and submitted to the Texas Historical Commission.
Definition of Archeological Sites and Historic
Properties
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, requires
the lead federal agency with jurisdiction over a
federal, federally assisted, or federally licensed
action to consider impacts to historic properties
before undertaking that action. A historic property is defined as any pre-contact or historic district, archeological site, building, structure, or
object included in, or eligible for, inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Under this definition, other cultural resources may
be present within the APE but are not considered
historic properties if they do not meet the eligibility requirements for listing on the NRHP. The
NRHP also generally restricts historic properties
to being greater than 50 years of age, although
there are provisions for listing significant cultural
resources of more recent origin.
For the purpose of this document, identified
cultural resources are separated into two classes:
archeological sites and non-archeological site
loci. Very small amounts of historic and prehistoric debris are commonly scattered over the
landscape and found during a Phase I archeological survey. Generally speaking, the sole research
value that these loci provide is through the information imparted by their precise geographic and
environmental position. This data can be used by
future researchers to better model settlement or
site distribution patterns, but is effectively gathered in its entirety during the Phase I recordation
process. The lack of artifacts and/or the poor depositional integrity that is present at these locations
prevent them from meeting the National Register
of Historic Places eligibility criteria of evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). Areas of human activity

Faunal Material Analysis
The limited faunal material that was recovered during the investigation was examined using standard zooarcheological protocols. The
identification of faunal specimens was based on
the analyst comparing the recovered material to
a reference collection maintained by R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc. The analysis
also was aided by consulting standard reference
works. The selected samples were identified to
class, order, family, genus, or species. In general,
taxonomic classes can include Aves (birds), Mammalia (mammals), Osteichthyes (fish), Reptilia
(reptiles), Invertebra (invertebrates), and Indeterminate specimens. If specimens cannot be identified below class, fragments are classified into size
categories: large, large-medium, medium, medium-small, and small. Classification into size classes will be determined subjectively based on cortical thickness, amount of cancellous bone present,
and fragment curvature. Within each taxon, efforts
are made to determine element, portion, and side
of each specimen.
Cultural Resources Assessment and Reporting
Based in part on the field and laboratory data,
a recommendation of significance was offered for
all archeological sites, non-site cultural resource
loci and/or historic standing structures that were
identified during completion of the Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inven106

Determination of National Register Eligibility
of Identified Cultural Resources
The implementing regulation of Section
106 is 36 CFR Part 800. This regulation establishes a process of identifying cultural resources
that may be affected by the proposed undertaking, evaluating each in terms of their eligibility
for listing to the NRHP, assessing the effects on
those cultural resources determined to be historic
properties; and ensuring consultation for methods
to avoid, reduce, or mitigate any adverse effects
on NRHP-listed or -eligible properties. Adverse
effects include, but are not limited to, destruction
or alteration of all or part of a property; isolation
from or alteration of its surrounding environment; introduction of visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that are out of character with the
property or that alter its setting; transfer or sale
of a federally owned property without adequate
conditions or restrictions regarding preservation,
maintenance, or use; and neglect of a property resulting in its deterioration or destruction (36 CFR
800.5). The intent of Section 106 is for federal
agencies to take into account potential adverse effects on any historic properties situated within the
APE of the proposed undertaking; and to afford
the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
(ACHP) an opportunity to comment on the proposed action within a reasonable period. When
making eligibility recommendations on cultural
resources identified during the current undertaking, R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.
staff have taken into account both the federal and
state criteria of evaluation presented below.
To be designated a historic property, the site
must be listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The criteria
(36CFR 60.4 [a-d]) defined for Section for evaluating the significance of a site are as follows:

that are defined as archeological sites also may
not contain the level of significance required to
be designated a historic property under Section
106, but at least meet a defined minimum threshold where more rigorous evaluation procedures
are warranted.
The State of Texas does not have a specific
definition of what constitutes an archeological
site for Section 106 compliance efforts. Title
13, Part 2, Chapter 24 of the Texas Government
Code, does, however, provide guidance. Section
8 of that code defines a cultural resource as “a
site or place where there is physical evidence of
past human activities, such as structures, artifacts
or alterations of the natural environment, and
which is fifty or more years old” while Section
13 defines a site as “a cultural resource location
containing evidence of either a prehistoric and/
or historic occupation, or activity, building, or
structure, whether standing, in ruin, or vanished,
where the location itself maintains historical or
archeological value regardless of the value of any
existing structure.”
The difficulty from an interpretive standpoint
is in assessing what constitutes “historical or archeological value” when defining an archeological site. To ensure that Section 106 compliance is
met for federally funded or reviewed projects, a
low threshold is generally warranted. For the purpose of this document, we have assessed any cultural resource that returned more than five artifacts
from surface or subsurface locations as constituting a site. Alternately, a standing structure with
any number of artifacts found both in association
and in a subsurface context was also designated an
archaeological site. Finally, historic structures can
be important in and of themselves. Each identified
structure documented by R. Christopher Goodwin
& Associates was evaluated by an architectural
historian. Any structure found to be potentially
significant when applying the National Register
of Historic Places criteria is automatically raised
to archeological site status. All other cultural resources were classified as non-archaeological site
loci. A formal site inventory form or site update
form was submitted to the Texas Archeological
Research laboratory (TARL) for any location defined as an archeological site during the current
Phase I investigation.

Curation
After the final report has been accepted,
all cultural material not desired by landowners,
drawings, maps, photographs, and field notes will
be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. This institution is located at the University of Texas at Austin, J.J. Pickle Research
Campus, Bldg. 5, 10100 Burnet Road, Austin,
Texas 78758.

Further to the above, Title 13, Part 2, Chapter
24, Rule 26.8 of the Texas Government Code
provides additional criteria that are used by the
Texas Historical Commission in their evaluation
of archeological sites found within Texas. Specifically, these criteria are that:
1)

2)

3)
4)

5)

the site has the potential to contribute to a
better understanding of the prehistory and/
or history of Texas by the addition of new
and important information;
the site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or
preservation interests of the site;
the site possesses unique or rare attributes
concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
the study of the site offers the opportunity
to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific
knowledge;
the high likelihood that vandalism and relic
collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to
insure maximum legal protection, or alternatively further investigations are needed to
mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic
collecting when the site cannot be protected.

Identification of Cultural Resource Locations
Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 24, Rule 24.3 of
the Texas Government Code requires that certain
cultural resource data not be made available to
the general public. The intent of the legislation
is to protect archeological sites, and by extension
the state’s cultural history, from damage through
uncontrolled collections and excavations. The
cultural resources that the commission generally
considers to need this confidentiality are archeological sites, shipwrecks, and certain historic
structures and engineering features. The current
document adheres to this guideline and therefore
does not provide any information that could be
used to specifically locate a cultural resource.

CHAPTER VII

RESULTS OF THE FIELD INVESTIGATION

T

his chapter presents the results of the
Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory conducted for the
proposed Gulf Crossing Project pipeline corridor, associated alternate routes and appurtenant
facilities. From west to east, the counties crossed
in Texas by the proposed undertaking include
Grayson, Fannin, Lamar, Delta, Hopkins, Franklin, Titus, Morris, and Cass Counties (see Figure
1.1). Fieldwork for this project consisted of pedestrian survey, augmented by systematic shovel
testing of most landforms. As noted in Chapter V,
the great majority of the proposed Gulf Crossing
Project corridor is directly adjacent to existing
cleared pipeline rights-of-way, much of which
was surveyed for cultural resources during the
1988 to 1990 field investigations for the Southern
Interconnect and Black Marlin pipeline projects
(Perttula and Nathan 1988; Peter et al. 1989). The
stated survey corridor for those two projects generally varied in width from 15.2 to 22.9 m (50
to 75 ft), whereas the Gulf Crossing Project survey corridor was 91.5 or 106.7 m (300 or 350 ft)
wide.
In total, 211.8 km (131.6 mi) of the Texas
portion of the proposed pipeline route was surveyed for cultural resources, while 9.8 km (6.1
mi) of the corridor remains unassessed (Table
7.1); the unsurveyed lands will be inventoried
and reported after land access has been granted
to Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC. An additional 39.8 km (24.7 mi) of pipeline corridor
was surveyed during the course of the Phase I investigation (see Table 7.2 and Appendix I); this
additional corridor represents potential routes for
the pipeline that were subsequently abandoned in
favor of the preferred alignment. Construction of
the proposed Gulf Crossing Project also will require the use of above-ground facilities such as
compressor stations, contractor warehouse yards
and meter stations. The status of cultural resource

surveys for the appurtenant facilities is listed in
Table 7.3.
Each examined portion of the preferred route
alignment, pipeline alternative route and appurtenant facility was inspected for cultural material
and/or evidence of intact cultural deposits. As noted in Chapter VI, all shovel tests excavated during the Phase I investigation measured at least 30
cm (11.8 in) in diameter and were excavated into
subsoil. In areas where pre-Holocene sediments
could not be firmly established by visual means,
shovel tests were excavated to a minimum depth
of 50 cmbs (19.7 inbs) and the field crew was instructed, where feasible, to excavate at least two
levels (20 cm [7.9 in]) below the maximum level
of recovered artifacts. A total of 5,618 shovel
tests were excavated during the Phase I cultural
resource survey and archeological inventory. As
also noted in the preceding chapter, shovel tests
were not excavated in areas of extreme slope,
where surface visibility exceeded 40 percent, in
areas of extensive land disturbance, or in areas
covered by standing water such as lakes, rivers or
marshes.
A total of 41 new or previously recorded
cultural resources were assessed as a result of
the current Phase I cultural resources survey effort. These cultural resources consisted of seven
previously recorded archeological sites, 15 newly
identified archeological sites or historic standing
structures, 18 isolated finds or modern cultural
material scatters, and a single historic cemetery.
Of the above cultural resources, 12 archeological
sites, one historic structure, and 14 of the isolated
finds/modern refuse scatters are situated within the
preferred project corridor. The remaining 14 cultural resources now lie outside of the undertaking
footprint due to pipeline design changes (Table
7.4). These cultural resources are described below
in separate sections. First, the archeological sites
and historic structures that lie within the preferred

Grayson County Survey Results
The proposed 42-inch O.D. Gulf Crossing
pipeline will begin at the proposed Sherman Compressor Station in Grayson County at Milepost
(MP) 0.0 and then trend to the northeast. It enters
Fannin County at MP 3.7 for a very short section
near Choctaw Creek, and then continues northeast
into Bryan County, crossing the Red River at Milepost 4.1 (Appendix I). With one exception, the
entire proposed corridor within Grayson County
was examined for near-surface cultural resources,
with negative results. The survey exception was a
1.0 km (0.6 mi) section that straddles Grayson and
Fannin Counties, between MP 3.4 and 4.0. This
area was encompassed by high 3.7 m (12 ft) fencing that enclosed an Elk paddock. At the time of
the field survey the elks were in rut. This section
has been selected for geoarcheological assessment due to the soils that are present (Appendix
II). Based on the geomorphological evaluation,
near-surface cultural materials are not considered
likely. The section is scheduled for geoprobe testing after land owner permission is granted to Gulf
Crossing Pipeline Company LLC. The results of
this testing will be sent to the SHPO and FERC as
a supplemental report.
The single additional project area surveyed
in Grayson County included a region encompassing the proposed 8.1 ha (20 ac) Sherman Compressor Station (Appendix I). This facility will
also house the proposed Enterprise Meter Station
and a pig launcher within its footprint. No cultural resources were identified during shovel testing
and pedestrian survey of this area.

pipeline route are described, with each assessed
in terms of it recommended eligibility for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places, applying the NRHP criteria of eligibility (36 CFR 60.4
[a-d]). This section is followed by short descriptions of very low-density cultural material finds
within the preferred corridor that did not meet
the definition of an archeological site presented
in Chapter VI (isolated finds) and other material
scatters that were recorded in the field but later assessed as modern refuse deposits. A third section
describes the archeological sites, isolated finds and
historic structures that were identified during the
current survey but which now lie entirely outside
the project Area of Potential Effect due to later reroutes. Finally, a section is presented that briefly
describes previously recorded archeological sites
that are plotted on the Texas Site Atlas as lying
within or directly adjacent to the preferred project corridor, but which were not found during the
current investigation despite the efforts made to
re-identify them. These descriptions are provided
in the unlikely event that cultural materials are encountered at these locations during construction of
the pipeline and the Unanticipated Discovery Plan
is enacted.
Additional Phase I cultural resource investigations will be conducted for all unsurveyed
project items of the Gulf Crossing project prior
to its construction. These surveys will include all
private access roads that may require upgrades,
the unsurveyed sections of the proposed mainline corridor that are listed in Table 7.1, and any
additional temporary work spaces or additional
above-ground facilities that extend outside of the
surveyed environmental corridor. These additional surveys are anticipated to be completed in late
2007 and early 2008.

County at MP 3.7 and then immediately exits
Fannin County to enter Bryan County, Oklahoma.
The proposed pipeline re-enters Fannin County at
a second crossing of the Red River at MP 41.3,
then travels southeast and exits into Lamar County at MP 48.8 (Appendix I). The entire corridor
was surveyed for cultural resources within this
latter portion of Fannin County. As noted above,
the section between MP 3.4 and 4.0 will be undergoing geoprobe testing after land owner permission is granted to Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC. The results of the deep testing will be
submitted to the SHPO and FERC in a separate
supplemental report.
A total of two cultural resources were identified during the current Phase I investigation
within the preferred pipeline route; an additional
three cultural resources were identified during the
survey but now lie outside of the project area due
to changes in the project’s design. The two loci
within the preferred corridor consist of a previously recorded archeological site (41FN42) and
one newly identified archeological site (41FN82).
Typical soil profiles that were encountered at
these sites are shown in Table 7.5. Individual descriptions of the two examined sites are presented
below. Based on the Phase I investigation results,
the two sites are not believed to possess the qualities of significance required to be considered historic properties under Section 106 guidelines.

a slight ridge. The pedestrian survey and shovel
testing program associated with the current undertaking relocated the site within the proposed
Area of Potential Effect, although the recovery
was limited to a single artifact that was found in
one shovel test (Figure 7.1 and Table 7.6). The
ground surface within the area was generally
obscured as the field is presently used for cattle
pasture; the exception was a two-track road to the
south of the find where surface visibility was excellent.
The single artifact identified was a sherd
from an undecorated hard-paste porcelain cup.
This artifact could date from any time within the
historic/modern period. There was no evidence
of surface or subsurface features present within
the area. Based on the low numbers of artifacts
found and the previous use of the landform for
agricultural use, the site is not believed to retain
stratigraphic integrity or research value. The
current examination agrees with the original research findings that Site 41FN42 does not meet
the criteria of significance required for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places (36 CFR
60.4 [a-d]). No further archeological study is recommended for this location.
Site 41FN82 (Temp ID A020707A-01)

NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Site 41FN82 is a newly identified site that
was recorded within the environmental survey corridor associated with the proposed Gulf
Crossing Project (Appendix I, Figure 7.2). It is
situated on a slight rise on the alluvial floodplain,
near an ephemeral stream. The land is currently
cattle pasture but has been used for agricultural
purposes in the past. Although ground visibility
was relatively poor, all of the artifacts were iden-

tified within a 10 m (32.8 ft) diameter area during
the pedestrian survey; no subsurface cultural materials were located during shovel tests excavated
in the vicinity of the finds (Tables 7.7 and 7.8).
The cultural materials recovered from Site
41FN82 consisted mainly of aboriginal lithic artifacts (n=14) although some faunal elements
were also present (n=3). The aboriginal lithic artifacts included agate/chalcedony (n=2) and chert
(n=9) debitage, as well as chert (n=1) and quartz/
ite (n=1) fire-cracked rock. Also identified was a
quartzite cobble that exhibited evidence of heavy
utilization as a hammerstone (Figure 7.3b). None
of the lithic artifacts recovered from the ground
surface were temporally diagnostic. The few faunal remains that were observed consisted exclusively of bivalve (Bivalvia) shell fragments (n=3).
While it is considered likely given their proximity
that these shellfish fragments are evidence of food

remains associated with the prehistoric occupation, their surface provenience could potentially
result from later processes or modern disturbance.
Although Site 41FN82 displayed a moderate density of prehistoric artifacts and potential
faunal remains within a confined area, there is
no evidence that intact subsurface deposits exist
at the location. The site therefore does not contain significant research value as defined by the
NRHP criteria of eligibility (36 CFR 60.4 [d]).
No further archeological investigations are therefore recommended for Site 41FN82.

0.37 km (0.23 mi) of the 72.1 km (44.8 mi) long
environmental survey corridor that is situated in
Lamar County was assessed for cultural resources
during the current Phase I investigation. The three
remaining short sections listed in Table 7.1 will
be surveyed in the near future, after Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC has secured rights of
entry from the respective landowners.
A total of 12 cultural resources were identified
within Lamar County during the Phase I cultural
resources survey. These included two newly identified archeological sites and six isolated find spots
within the preferred pipeline corridor; the remaining cultural resources now lie outside of the project
area due to changes in the project’s design and are
described in a separate section, below. Typical soil
profiles that were encountered at the eight cultural
resource in the project area are presented in Table
7.9. Individual descriptions of each of the examined sites and loci is presented below. All eight
cultural resources are believed to not possess the
qualities of significance necessary for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places.
The single additional project area surveyed
in Lamar County included a region encompassing the proposed 8.1 ha (20 ac) Paris Compressor
Station (see Appendix I). This facility will also
house the proposed Crosstex Meter Station and a
pig launcher within its footprint. No cultural resources were identified during shovel testing and
pedestrian survey of this area.

Table 7.9

Site 41LR357 (Temp. ID A020607b-01)
Type: Historic structure and artifact scatter
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Site 41LR357 consists of a single Historic
Period standing structure that is associated with
a light scatter of historic artifacts (Figure 7.4). It
is a newly identified site that was recorded during shovel testing associated with the current undertaking. The site is situated within the alluvial
floodplain, on a level surface that is located well
away from any streams. The land is currently
cleared for residential use. Ground visibility was
poor, and the only artifacts recovered came from
a single shovel test located well away from the
structure.
The standing structure (Figure 7.5) is a vernacular-style double shotgun residence, built ca.
early twentieth century. The building appears to
be structurally sound, but it is in poor condition.
Rectangular in plan, the one-story wood frame
structure is abandoned with missing doors and
windows. The openings of the structure are partially boarded. The roof of the building is simple
hipped and sheathed with corrugated metal. The
exterior is clad with horizontal lapped wood siding
that, while damaged, appears to be largely intact.
A brick chimney is placed asymmetrically near
the peak of the roof, and it appears to be a modern
addition. The residence is raised on a wood block
foundation, and it may (or may not) have been
moved from another location. Recently, it appears

spite of extensive deterioration, the structure does
retain its historic feeling but it does not appear to
be architecturally distinguished, nor does it possess integrity of materials or workmanship.
Cultural artifacts recovered from Site
41LR357 were limited to a single fragment each
of metal and glass (Table 7.10). The glass specimen was from a clear bottle while the ferrous
metal fragment was not identifiable to a specific
category or function. Both artifacts were found
within the top 10 cm (3.9 in) of the ground surface
from the single positive shovel test excavated at
the site. It is likely that the artifacts are associated
with the structure, given their context, but they
are not temporally diagnostic on their own.
Based on an architectural review of the structure and an archeological examination of the recovered artifacts, Site 41LR357 does not possess
the attributes necessary for NRHP-listing. This assessment is based on the general lack of recovered
artifacts coupled with the type and poor condition
of the structure. In addition, research of the readily available background resources discloses no
connection of the structure to any significant historical event or person. Examined sources include
county tax assessment records, land grant records
held by the Archives & Records Division of the
Texas General Land Office, U.S. census records,
The Handbook of Texas Online (Texas State Historical Association), and various online articles
and documents available through the TXGenWeb
Project. No additional recordation of the structure
or archeological testing is recommended.

South Project corridor. The site, which currently
measures roughly 40 by 30 m (131.2 by 98.4 ft)
in area (Figure 7.6), is located partially within
a cultivated field and partially within a forested
area of the broad alluvial floodplain. The nearest
substantial water course is located more than 500
m (1640 ft) to the south. Ground visibility within
the site vicinity was generally poor due to grass
cover. The southern margin of the site could not
be fully evaluated as it extended outside of the
91.5 m (300 ft) survey corridor for which land
access was permitted by the land owner.
Cultural material recovered from Site
41LR358 (Table 7.11) consisted exclusively of
historic to modern era artifacts (n=18). By material type, these were sorted as brick (n=3), historic
ceramic (n=3), glass (n=4), ferrous metal (n=3),
and mortar/concrete (n=5). The historic ceramic
artifacts consisted of a single sherd of molded
yellow “Fiesta Ware” (1936-present; www.hlchina.com) and two sherds of undecorated ironstone
that were manufactured between 1842 and 1930
(Miller et al. 2000). Glass artifacts consisted
of various aqua-colored bottle/container glass
shards. One molded aqua glass artifact represented an early form of an electrical insulator (Figure
7.7a). Another artifact (Figure 7.7b) was recognized as coming from a large glass container and
had an Owens scar and an Illinois Glass Company
maker’s mark, which provides a production date
range for this artifact of 1916 to 1929 (Toulouse
1971:264-268). Ferrous metal artifacts consisted
of a cut nail (common ca. 1790-1890; Markell et
al. 1999), a wire nail (common ca. 1885-present;
Markell et al. 1999), and a threaded metal screw/
bolt. As a whole, the artifacts recovered from Site
41LR358 were suggestive of domestic debris dating to the early part of 20th century.
No intact structural remains were observed
in the vicinity of the artifact recoveries, which
ranged from 0 to 30 cm (0 - 11.8 in) below sur-

face. The possible remnants of an outdoor brick
hearth or fireplace were noted; this feature consisted of a pad and open semi-circle of brick near
the treeline. Several of the bricks are stamped
“Ferris” which indicates their manufacture by
the Ferris Brick Company. This manufacturer
was situated in the town of Ferris in Ellis County, Texas and was in operation from the turn of
the twentieth century (http://www.tsha.utexas.

area was observed by the presence of a well or
cistern near the brick feature. The lack of intact
structural remains and both the type and low frequency of historic artifacts within Site 41LR358
indicates that the portion of the site that is situated within the surveyed Gulf Crossing corridor
does not contain significant research value. On
this basis, the examined portion of the site site
has been assessed as not meeting the qualities of
significance necessary for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]).

Isolated Finds and Modern Refuse Piles Located within the Preferred Lamar County
Corridor
Six cultural resources identified within the
preferred pipeline corridor did not have sufficient
artifact density, age or depositional integrity to
be called archeological sites. These six loci do
not meet the criteria of significance for listing on
the National Register. Summaries of the artifacts
recovered from these locations are shown in Table 7.12. Three of the activity areas (designated
B020607A-01, B021107A-02 and B032507A01) were recorded in the field as historic artifact
scatters. After laboratory analysis these materials
were determined to be modern (less than 50 years
in age). They are included only in the event of
future reference to the curated field notes.

Isolated Find LR-66.25
Type: Prehistoric Period (Late Archaic to Middle
Woodland) isolated find
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Isolated Find LR-66.25 was identified during pedestrian survey of the Gulf Crossing Project
environmental survey corridor (Figure 7.8). The
locus, measuring no more than 20 m (65.6 ft) in
diameter, lies within a cleared plowed agricultural field on an alluvial plain, approximately 70 m
(230 ft) to the east of a small drainage. The single
artifact recovered from Isolated Find LR-66.25
was a prehistoric aboriginal lithic tool, identified as the base of a Gary type projectile point/
knife made of silicified sandstone (Figure 7.9b).
Although a wide range of contracting stemmed
points can be included within the Gary category
type, these points are generally assigned to the
Late Archaic to Middle Woodland Periods (Davies et al. 1997:397-398; Justice 1987:189-190).
Shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the
isolated find failed to locate any subsurface component to this locus. Through a lack of additional
artifact recoveries and the absence of intact site
deposits, Isolated Find LR-66.25 has been assessed as not possessing the requisite qualities
of significance, applying the National Register
of Historic Places criteria of evaluation (36 CFR

60.4 [a-d]). No additional archeological testing is
recommended for this isolated find.
Isolated Find LR-66.15
Type: Historic Period (19th to 20th century) isolated find
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Isolated Find LR-66.15 was identified during pedestrian survey within the proposed Gulf
Crossing Project survey corridor (Figure 7.10).
The locus, measuring no more than 20 m (65.6
ft) in diameter, lies within a cleared plowed agricultural field on the alluvial plain, away from any
natural water source. Only a single historic ceramic sherd artifact was observed and recovered
from Isolated Find LR-66.15. The type of sherd
was identified as being Albany slip stoneware,
which according to Miller et al. (2000) has a date
range of ca. 1805 to 1920.
Shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the
isolated sherd failed to identify any subsurface
component to this locus. Given this fact and the
lack of additional artifact recoveries, Isolated
Find LR-66.15 does not posses the qualities of
significance as defined by the National Register
of Historic Places criteria for evaluation (36 CFR
60.4 [a-d]). No additional testing is recommended.

Isolated Find A013007b-01
Type: Historic Periodl (19th century) isolated find
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Isolated Find A013007b-01 was identified
during subsurface testing of the proposed Gulf
Crossing pipeline corridor. It measures no more
than 30 m (98.4 ft) in extent based on the distribution of artifacts, which were limited to a single
positive shovel test (Figure 7.11). The locus was
situated in a fallow field that is being used as cattle pasture. A small drainage is located about 25
m (82 ft) to the north. Ground visibility was poor
due to dense grass cover.
The single artifact recovered from Isolated Find A013007b-01 was an annular yellow
ware ceramic sherd (Figure 7.9a). According to
Markell et al. (1999), annular yellow ware was
produced between ca. 1840 and 1900. Given the
lack of additional artifact recoveries within the

area, the locus likely represents a single refuse
disposal event.
Visual examination of the ground surface
and additional shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the positive find failed to locate any additional artifacts within this area. Based on the low
number of artifacts and the absence of intact site
features, Isolated Find A013007b-01 is assessed
as not possessing the qualities of significance
necessary for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No additional archeological testing is recommended.

was found on a level portion of the broad alluvial
floodplain, within a field that is currently used for
cattle pasture. No water courses are in close proximity to the location. It measures approximately
75 by 50 m (246.1 by 164 ft) in extent based on
the distribution of the observed cultural materials
(Figure 7.12).
The locus consists of the observation of a
small, recently collapsed structure made of tin
and wood and an associated scatter of modern refuse. The artifacts identified in the area included
brick, concrete and clear window and bottle glass.
Besides the collapsed structure, the only feature
is a small fire pit. Shovel tests excavated in the
vicinity of the surface finds failed to locate any
subsurface cultural materials.
After the site was recorded, the artifacts
were analyzed and discovered to represent modern types less than 50 years of age. Based on the

recent origin of the artifacts and the condition
of the structure, the site is interpreted as being
an abandoned temporary hunting camp. Given
its condition and recent origin, it does not meet
the minimum standards required to be considered a historic property under Section 106 guidelines. No additional testing at Modern Scatter

The locus measures 70 m by 55 m (230 by 180.5
ft) in extent based on the observed distribution of
cultural material (Figure 7.13).
Although the locus was recorded during the
field investigation, the artifacts observed during
the Phase I cultural resources survey were assessed as being temporally non-diagnostic or of
modern origin (less than 50 years of age). These
items included glass, whiteware and plastic, and
were not collected. No subsurface cultural materials were identified in shovel tests that were excavated within the locus, indicating that earlier
cultural remains are not present. Given its recent
origin, it does not meet the minimum standards
required to be considered a historic property under Section 106 guidelines. No additional testing
at Modern Scatter B021107a-02 is therefore required.

Modern Scatter B032507a-01
Type: Modern artifact scatter
NRHP Assessment: Ineligible
Modern Scatter B032507a-01 was identified during the systematic pedestrian survey conducted within the proposed Gulf Crossing pipeline corridor. The locus was found on top of a
slight hill that is situated within the broad alluvial
floodplain. A small ephemeral stream is situated
approximately 100 m (328 ft) to the north. The
locus measures roughly 23 m (75.4 ft) in diameter
based on the observed distribution of cultural materials (Figure 7.14).
As with the above two loci, although
B032507a-01 was recorded during the Phase I
field investigation, the artifacts and features observed during the assessment were found to be of
modern origin (less than 50 years of age). These
artifacts observed on the ground surface consisted

tural resources during the current Phase I investigation. A single (1.8 mi) section that is located
between MP 97.5 and MP 99.3 will be surveyed
after Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC has
secured rights of entry from the respective landowners.
A total of 10 cultural resources were identified within Franklin County during the Phase I
cultural resources survey. Six of these resources
are located within the preferred corridor, while
the remaining four sites outside of the project
area due to design changes . These latter four
sites are described in a separate section, below.
The cultural resources within the project area include three previously identified archeological
sites that were revisited during the current investigation (41FK88, 41FK90 and 41FK91), a newly
identified archeological sites (41FK124) and two
newly identified isolated find spots (B022507A01 and G032407A-01). Typical soil profiles that
were encountered at each cultural resource are
presented in Table 7.13. Individual descriptions
of each of the examined sites and loci is presented
below. Only Site 41FK88 has been assessed as
being potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, under Criterion
D. Avoidance or Phase II site evaluation testing is recommended for this site. The remaining
cultural resources do not appear to possess the
qualities of significance necessary for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places.

Delta / Hopkins / Red River Counties Survey
Results
The proposed Gulf Crossing pipeline corridor exits Lamar County at MP 93.8, crosses the
North Sulphur River and then traverses across
two very short sections of Delta and Hopkins
Counties before entering Franklin County. The
segment through Delta County is located between
MP 93.8 to MP 94.4 while the section that lies
within Hopkins County extends only from MP
94.4 to MP 94.5 (Appendix I). These two sections
were fully examined for cultural resources during
the current Phase I investigation, with negative
results. In addition, no known archeological sites
have been recorded in either Delta or Hopkins
Counties that are located in close proximity to the
Gulf Crossing Project corridor.

field personnel also examined a substantial route
alternate of the pipeline during the 2007 field effort. This alternate, which has subsequently been
abandoned by Gulf Crossing in favor of the current route alignment, extended east-southeast
from MP 92.0 through approximately 4 miles of
Red River County (Appendix I). No cultural resources were identified along the surveyed alternate route.

Site 41FK88 was initially recorded in 1988
during the Phase I cultural resources survey of
the Southern Interconnect Pipeline project (Peter

with an unknown prehistoric cultural affiliation,
the site measured 60 m by 68 m (197 by 223 ft)
in extent. All cultural materials were found from
a subsurface context, from depths of 0 to 50 cm
(0 to 19.7 in) below surface. In addition to an
unspecified number of lithic flakes, the researchers identified a possible subsurface soils lens or

13.8 in) below surface; the soil in this lens was
discolored and contained charcoal flecks. The site
was assessed as potentially eligible for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places. Avoidance or Phase II testing was the recommended
management option for this site.
The site, as measured during the current
field effort is 75 m by 45 m (246.1 by 147.6 ft),
and it is located on a ridge to the south side of
a creek (Figure 7.15). The upper portion of the
ground surface in the eastern portion of the site
has been disturbed through recent timber harvesting activities and the installation of a nearby oil
derrick. The western section of the site displays
less evidence of disturbance and is covered by
older deciduous trees (Figure 7.16). The northern
boundary of the site could not be determined as it
lies outside of the corridor for which survey permission had been granted by the land owner.
A total of 47 artifacts were recovered from
Site 41FK88; these included both prehistoric aboriginal lithics (n=44) and ceramic sherds (n=3).
The aboriginal lithic artifacts (Table 7.14) consisted of chert (n=33) and silicified sandstone (n=10)
debitage, as well as a single tested chert cobble.
The aboriginal ceramic artifacts (Table 7.15) included a single grog-tempered jar sherd that was
tentatively classified as Nash Neck Banded (Figure 7.17a), which is a utility ware of the early to
middle Caddo period (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks
1954:332). Other aboriginal ceramic sherds recovered from Site 41FK88 were classified as

grog-tempered, plain (n=1), and grog-tempered
with unidentifiable (UID) decoration (n=1).
Based on the type and numbers of artifacts
recovered, the site likely represents the remains
of a short-term prehistoric camp site dating from
the Early to Middle Caddo Period (ca. 1000-600
BP). The site exhibits a considerable degree of
ground surface disturbance that has obviously
impacted depositional integrity to some degree,
particularly in its eastern portion given the recovery of some ceramic and lithic artifacts from
the surface. However, while evidence of a buried
soil lens or feature was not found during the current investigation, it was noted during the 1988
site visit. The recovery of a moderate number of
lithic artifacts from this same depth (Levels 2-4)
suggests that intact subsurface cultural deposits
may potentially exist within portions of the site.
An intact single component site with features that
could be dated chronometrically could meet the
eligibility requirements for listing the site on the
National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D (the site may likely yield data of importance to prehistory).
The portion of Site 41FK88 that lies within
the environmental survey corridor for the Gulf
Crossing Pipeline Project may possess the qualities of significance as defined by the National Register of Historic Places criterion of evaluation (36
CFR 60.4 [d]). Phase II National Register evaluation of the site is recommended if Gulf Crossing
intends to utilize this area during construction of

avoidance was recommended.
The pedestrian survey and shovel testing
program associated with the current undertaking
relocated Site 41FK90 within the Gulf Crossing
Project survey corridor (Figure 7.18). The site, as
currently defined, measures 80 by 40 m (262.4 by
131.2 ft); however, the southern boundary of the
site could not be fully delineated as it lay outside
of the permitted environmental survey corridor.
The site lies within an active oil production area,
and the ground surface within the proposed Gulf
Crossing corridor has been heavily impacted
from disturbances associated with oil production.
No evidence of the pimple mounds observed in
1988 were observed within the 90.5 m (300 ft)
wide environmental survey corridor; however the
site was not investigated outside of the permitted

the proposed pipeline. Additional Phase I cultural
resources survey will be required should any reroutes be developed to avoid the site.

Site 41FK90 was first identified during a
Phase I investigation conducted for the proposed
Southern Interconnect pipeline project (Peter et
al. 1989; Perttula and Nathan 1988). It is situated on a slight ridge to the north of a creek in a
broad alluvial setting. The site was described as
a light scatter of prehistoric lithics and ceramics
that likely dated to the prehistoric Caddoan Period. The artifacts were solely collected from 0 to
40 cm (0 to 15.7 in) below surface and extended
over a 100 by 80 m (328 by 262.4 ft) area, including two nearby pimple mounds. The site was as-

area to the south, where these landforms appear
to lie based on the site form.
Investigations at Site 41FK90 resulted in the
recovery of only eight lithic artifacts (Table 7.16).
All were recovered from subsurface contexts. The
artifacts were sorted as agate/chalcedony (n=1),
chert (n=5), and silicified sandstone (n=2) debitage. Although these materials were indicative of
an aboriginal occupation of the site, they could
not be confirmed to be from the Caddoan Period,
as suggested by the earlier research conducted for
the Southern Interconnect Pipeline project.
Site 41FK90 was found during the current
investigation to be a low density subsurface scatter of prehistoric lithics within a highly disturbed
area. Based on the numbers of artifacts recovered,
the site likely represents a single short term occupation or lithic reduction activity area and the
artifacts have been dispersed by later land disturbance. The site either has been impacted severely
by recent disturbances associated with oil and timber harvesting activities or the forested intact cultural deposits that are described on the site form
are situated farther to the south, outside of the
surveyed corridor. Based on the low numbers of
artifacts and the level of ground disturbance, little
research potential exists within the assessed portion of Site 41FK90. The portion of the site that
lies within the surveyed corridor is not believed to
possess the qualities of significance necessary for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(36 CFR 60.4 [d]). Additional archeological study
within this portion of the site is not recommended.

1989; Perttula and Nathan 1988). It is situated on a
forested hilltop on a broad alluvial floodplain; the
nearest natural water sources is located more than
300 m (984 ft) away. The site was described as a
light scatter of prehistoric lithics. A disparity exists
in the form for this site. While one section of the
form states that artifacts were only recovered from
0 to 20 cm (0 to 7.9 in) below surface, elsewhere
form it reads that surface recoveries were made on
the east slope of the hill. The artifacts are reported
as extending over a 110 by 90 m (360.8 by 295.2
ft) area. The site was assessed as being potentially
eligible for listing to the National Register of Historic Places and site avoidance was recommended.
The pedestrian survey and shovel testing
program associated with the current undertaking
relocated Site 41FK90 within the Gulf Crossing
Project survey corridor (Figure 7.19). The site
measures 75 by 40 m (246 4 by 131.2 ft) in extent.
The assessed site location lies primarily within an
area of secondary regrowth from timber harvesting. Significant ground disturbance was evident,
with the surface finds described as having been
“plowed up” by land clearing activities.
Cultural materials recovered from Site
41FK91 consisted mainly of prehistoric aboriginal
lithic debitage (n=20) although a single prehistoric
ceramic artifact was also found (Tables 7.17 and
7.18). The lithic artifacts were all made of silicified sandstone. They included four tools, which
were identified as a biface preform (Figure 7.17b),
a unifacial multiple edge tool, and two expedient
edge-modified or utilized flakes. Non-tool lithic
artifacts consisted of debitage (n=12) and firecracked rock (n=3). The single aboriginal ceramic
artifact recovered was identified as an undecorated
grog-tempered ceramic sherd. Although the artifacts recovered from Site 41FK91 were indicative
of an prehistoric aboriginal occupation, they were
not diagnostic of any particular cultural period.

Site 41FK91 was found during the current
investigation to be a low density surface and
subsurface scatter of prehistoric lithics and ceramics within a highly disturbed area. Based on
the numbers of artifacts recovered, the site likely
represents a single short term occupation or lithic
reduction activity area. The artifacts observed at
the site have been dispersed by land disturbing
activities. While the data collected here remains
consistent with that reported during the 1988
Phase I study, we disagree with the previous assessment of the site as potential eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
The density of artifacts is quite low in comparison to the size of the site area and both studies
agree that the cultural deposits are shallow and
unlikely to contain intact subsurface features. In
addition, the current study found most of the site
area to have been substantially affected by timber
harvesting. For these reasons, it is our opinion
that Site 41FK91 does not possess the qualities of
significance necessary for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places (36 CFR 60.4 [d]). No
additional work is recommended.

site, which measures roughly 40 by 20 m (131.2
by 65.6 ft) in extent, is located within a densely
wooded area in close proximity to a pond (Figure
7.20). Ground visibility within the site vicinity
was poor due to ground cover.
A total of 15 artifacts was recovered during
Phase I investigations at Site 41FK124. These
consisted exclusively of prehistoric aboriginal
chert debitage (Table 7.19). These artifacts were
not diagnostic of a particular cultural or time period. All of the material was recovered from Stratum II, which underlay a very thin humic layer. ,
The artifacts were recovered from two positive
shovel test and from depths of 5 to 40 cm (2 to
15.7 in) below surface and were found in association with uncharred nut fragments. These nuts
were observed throughout the site locale on the
ground surface, indicating that the subsurface
cultural deposits have been disturbed, most likely
as a result of treefalls or animal burrows.
Site 41FK124 is a small prehistoric lithic
scatter that is situated in a densely wooded area.
The size of the site indicates that it represents
a single short term occupation, likely a hunting
camp or an area where tool resharpening was performed. Based on the presence of uncharred nuts
intermixed with the artifacts, it is believed that
some degree of land disturbance has occurred.
The low numbers of artifacts identified also indicate that the site does not have significant research value. It is our opinion that Site 41FK124

Two cultural resources identified within the
preferred pipeline corridor in Franklin County
did not have sufficient artifact density or depositional integrity to be called archeological sites.
These two loci do not meet the criteria of significance for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Summaries of the artifacts recovered
from these locations are shown in Table 7.20.
Brief descriptions and plan views of these loci are
presented below.

Type: Historic Period isolated find
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Isolated Find G032407A-01 was identified
during subsurface testing conducted within the
environmental survey corridor associated with
the proposed Gulf South Project. It was situated
near a creek and between two rises in the alluvial
floodplain. The locus was estimated to measure no
more than 20 m (65.6 ft) in diameter based on the
fact that the artifacts came from a single excavated
shovel test (Figure 7.22). Ground visibility within
the site vicinity was poor due to ground cover.
Only a single artifact was recovered from
Isolated Find G032407A-01, an undecorated
whiteware sherd. Whiteware is a common type
of ceramic material that has been in common use
from the 1890s to the present day (Miller et al.
2000). Based on the very low number and type of
artifact recoveries, the locus does not posses the
qualities of significance as defined by the National Register of Historic Places Criteria for Evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No additional testing of
Isolated Find B022507a-01 is recommended.

environmental survey corridor that is situated in
Titus County was assessed for cultural resources
during the current Phase I investigation. The four
remaining short sections listed in Table 7.1 will
be surveyed in the near future, after Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC has secured rights of
entry from the respective landowners.
A total of five cultural resources were
identified within Titus County during the Phase
I cultural resources survey. These included a
single previously recorded site (41TT564), two
newly identified archeological sites (41TT878
and 41TT879), and two newly identified nonarcheological site loci (A030907b-01 and
F032407a-01). Typical soil profiles that were
encountered at each cultural resource are presented in Table 7.21. Individual descriptions of
each of the examined sites and loci is presented
below. None of the assessed sites or loci are
believed to possess the qualities of significance
necessary for listing on the National Register of

of 0 to 35 cm (0 to 10.7 in) below surface. The
artifacts collected consisted only of lithic debris
in low numbers. This site was assessed as not
meeting the significance criteria for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41TT564 was re-identified during the
current investigation as a result of two positive
shovel located along Transect 2 within the proposed survey corridor. These tests were on the toe
slope of a large hill near a drainage (Figure 7.23).
The cultural material was recovered from Stratum II, levels 2 through 4 and the site was characterized as a low-density, subsurface lithic scatter.
Site 41TT564 was lineal in plan view, measuring
35 by 20 m (114.8 by 65.6 ft) in extent and oriented east-west.
Only 8 artifacts were recovered from Site
41TT564. These consisted exclusively of aboriginal lithic artifacts (Table 7.22), which were
classified as chert debitage (n=1), silicified sandstone debitage (n=6), and silicified sandstone
fire-cracked rock (n=1). These aboriginal artifacts were not temporally diagnostic of a particular cultural period.
As defined by the current Phase I survey results, Site 41TT564 consisted of a low number
of non-diagnostic, prehistoric lithics that were recovered from subsurface contexts. While the artifacts recovered from the site all originated from
subsurface contexts, they were confined to a small
area and were few in number. Consequently, the
research potential of the site is believed to be limited. Site 41TT564 has therefore been assessed as
not possessing the qualities of significance neces-

contained cultural materials.
A total of 11 artifacts were recovered from
the three positive tests. These artifacts were classified as prehistoric aboriginal ceramic sherds (n=9;
Table 7.23) and aboriginal lithics (n=2; Table
7.24). The two lithic artifacts found were a single
silicified sandstone flake and an expedient chert
tool, classified as an edge modified/utilized flake.

Site 41TT878 was recorded along a southwest facing, wooded terrace margin that overlooks a creek to the south; the triangular-shaped
site occupies almost the entire width of the proposed survey corridor (Figure 7.24). The site was
classified as a subsurface lithic and prehistoric
ceramic activity area, possibly associated with
the Late Prehistoric Caddo period. The site measures approximately 70 by 80 m (229.6 by 262.4
ft) in extent. All cultural materials were found
from a subsurface context, in both Strata I and

within the central portion of the Gulf Crossing
environmental survey corridor; it measures approximately 90 by 70 m (295.2 by 229.64 ft) in
extent and is roughly square in plan.
The site was classified as a subsurface lithic
reduction activity area. A total of 14 artifacts were
recovered during the assessment of Site 41TT879.
These consisted exclusively of aboriginal lithic
artifacts (Table 7.25). A total of two lithic tools
were identified, which were both classified as
edge modified/utilized flakes made of silicified
sandstone. These tools were not diagnostic of any
particular cultural period. The remaining aboriginal lithic artifacts were sorted as chert (n=2) and
silicified sandstone (n=11) debitage. The lithic
artifacts were recovered from six positive shovel
tests and were collected from Strata I and II, to a
depth of 40 cm (15.7 in) below surface.
Site 41TT879 is characterized as a low-density, subsurface scatter containing non-diagnostic,
prehistoric lithic artifacts. The portion of the site
within the survey corridor been cleared and leveled for pasture. Based on the above, the research
potential is considered limited for this site. Site

sidual (n=1). Although no sherds could be confidently assigned to an established type, the single
sherd classified as grog-tempered, incised (Figure
7.25a) resembled the types Dunkin Incised and
Kiam Incised, both of the earlier part of the Caddo period, while the remaining sherds in the collection also could represent Caddo period types.
Although all of the artifact recovered from
the site came from subsurface deposits, Site
41TT878 produced a very low density of cultural material. This would suggest a single short
term occupation, likely a temporary hunting
camp. The broad extent of the artifacts in relation to their low number is possibly an indication of unknown land disturbance factors. Based
on the frequency and types of artifacts identified,
the site displays poor research value and does not
possess the qualities of significance as defined by
the National Register of Historic Places Criteria
for Evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No additional
testing at Site 41TT878 is recommended.

Isolated Find F032407a-01
Type: Prehistoric Period isolated find
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Isolated Find F032407a-01 was identified
as a single prehistoric lithic that was recovered
during subsurface testing associated with the proposed Gulf Crossing Project survey corridor. It
was located on a gentle west facing side slope
within a cleared cow pasture; a small creek is located to the east. The locus measured 10 m (32.8
ft) in diameter and it was recorded along Transect
2 (Figure 7.28). The single artifact recovered
from Isolated Find F032407A-01 was identified
as an edge modified/utilized chert flake. This aboriginal lithic tool was not diagnostic to a particular cultural period. The lithic tool was recovered from the top 10 cm (3.9 in) of Stratum I;
additional shovel tests placed around the positive
find failed to locate any additional cultural materials. The lithic tool recovered from Isolated Find
F032407a-01 was not temporally diagnostic.
Extensive groundcover at the locus provided
poor surface visibility and the pasture had been
cleared and leveled previously. Given the low
artifact density, lack of temporally diagnostic
recoveries, and level of agricultural disturbance,
Isolated Find F032407a-01 does not posses the
qualities of significance as defined by the National Register of Historic Places criteria for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No additional testing is
recommended for Isolated Find F032407a-01.

Isolated Find A030907b-01
Type: Prehistoric Period isolated find
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Isolated Find A030907b-01 was identified
during systematic shovel testing within the proposed Gulf Crossing Project survey corridor. It
was located in a gently sloping pasture near the
toe slope of a large knoll (Figure 7.27). The locus
measures approximately 10 m (32.8 ft) in diameter and it was recorded along Transect 2. A total
of three artifacts were recovered from Isolated
Find A030907B-01, which consisted exclusively
of chert (n=2) and silicified sandstone (n=1) lithic
debitage. All three were recovered from Stratum
I, level 1; an additional seven delineation shovel
tests were placed around the locus and no further
cultural materials were noted. None of the lithics
recovered from Isolated Find A030907b-01 were
temporally diagnostic.
Surface exposure was poor at the locus due

Type: Prehistoric Period (Late Archaic) isolated
find
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Isolated Find Z031307a-01 was identified as
a single prehistoric lithic that was recovered from
a single excavated shovel test conducted within
the Gulf Crossing Pipeline environmental survey
corridor (Figure 7.29). It is situated on a broad,
north-facing ridge along the margins of a cleared
pasture. The locus is estimated to measure no
more than 10 m (32.8 ft) in diameter based on the
lack of any additional materials. The surrounding
area appears to have been disturbed by clearing
and leveling of the pasture.
The single artifact recovered from Isolated
Find Z031307a-01 consisted of the proximal portion of a projectile point/knife made of silicified
sandstone; this item was collected from Stratum II
(Figure 7.30). Although this artifact was not complete, a sufficient portion was available to classify it as a Yarbrough type point (Suhm, Kreiger,
and Jelks 1954:292-293). According to Davies et
al. (1997:405), the Yarbrough point type is generally considered to be a marker of the Late Archaic
period.
Given the presence of no additional artifact
recoveries and agricultural disturbance, Isolated
Find Z031307a-01 does not posses the qualities
of significance as defined by the National Register of Historic Places criteria for evaluation (36
CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No additional testing is recommended for the locus.

but 3.1 km (1.9 mi) of the 64.2 km (39.9 mi) long
environmental survey corridor that is situated in
Cass County was assessed for cultural resources
during the current Phase I investigation. The five
remaining short sections listed in Table 7.1 will
be surveyed in the near future, after Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC has secured rights of
entry from the respective landowners.
A total of seven cultural resources were identified within Cass County during the Phase I cultural resources survey. Five are located within the
preferred Gulf Crossing pipeline corridor, while
the remaining two are now situated outside of
the Area of Potential Effect due to changes in the
project design.. The five cultural resources in the
project area include one previously recorded archeological site (41CS137, a historic cemetery),
one newly identified structure (G032307B-01) and
three isolated find spots (designated F032307a01, F032607c-01 and Z031907b-01). Typical soil
profiles that were encountered at these cultural resources arepresented in Table 7.29. Individual descriptions of each of the examined sites and loci
are presented below. The historic cemetery (Site
41CS137) has not been assessed for its eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places; however, it is currently located outside of
the survey corridor associated with the proposed
Gulf Crossing Project. The remaining six cultural
resources do not possess the qualities of significance necessary for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

have no visible markers. All of the graves date
to the twentieth century, with the earliest marker
being for Mabel Boyd (1840-1927). The most recent grave marker is for O. B. Stephens (19161998), suggesting that the cemetery may still be
in use. The grounds of the cemetery have been
maintained.
Cemeteries are not automatically considered
historic properties under the National Register
of Historic Places criteria of evaluation. The historic research necessary to determine whether the
individuals interred at Cemetery LR-C049 have
the requisite level of local, state or national significance was not performed for the current undertaking. The edge of the cemetery fencing was
measured at 33 m (108 ft) from the proposed centerline; no impacts to the cemetery will occur if
Gulf Crossing limits construction to the standard
30.5 m (100 ft) wide construction corridor shown

posed Gulf Crossing Project (Figure 7.31). It is a
small private cemetery approximately 20 m by 20
m (65.6 ft) in size and it is square in plan view.
Based on the recent age of some headstones the
cemetery appears to still be in use by members of
the Boyd and related families. The outer boundaries of the cemetery are fenced and well-identified
(Figure 7.32). The closest edge of the cemetery
fenceline is 33 m (108.2 ft) to the proposed pipeline centerline. A house was visible southwest of
the cemetery; however, it was not examined due
to the presence of a dog on the property; it lies
outside of the survey corridor.
R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates field
personnel recorded all legible grave markers within the boundaries of the cemetery. There were a
total of three visible rows and eight graves which
could be accurately identified; an additional two
graves may be present based on depressions but

in Appendix V. To assure that the cemetery is not
inadvertently affected during construction , however, several safety precautions are recommended. First, it is recommended that Gulf Crossing
clearly mark the cemetery by placing high visibility safety fencing at least 3 m (10 ft) to the
northeast of the existing cemetery fence. The
safety fencing should extend the length of the existing cemetery boundary plus an additional 20 m
(65.6 ft) beyond each marked corner. Second, it is
recommended that Gulf Crossing have a monitor
present during construction of the pipeline within
this area to ensure that the cemetery is not adversely affected. This monitor must have the authority to halt construction in the unlikely event
that unrecorded human remains are encountered
at the location and the Unanticipated Discovery
and Emergency Procedures Plan needs to be enacted.

located within the Gulf Crossing environmental
survey corridor (Figure 7.33). Pedestrian survey
and shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the
structure failed to disclose any evidence of associated cultural materials. The structure is located
on a large knoll overlooking a creek to the south.
The structure is occupied, and its caretaker reports that the building was constructed ca. 1922
by the current owner’s family, who later moved
the structure from its original location farther
along the fronting road.
The residence is in excellent condition. Rectangular in plan, the large one-story wood frame
structure has a hipped roof with a gabled dormer.
The roof is sheathed with asphalt shingles and
extends over a generously sized porch across the
façade (Figure 7.34). A brick chimney protrudes
near the left top ridge of the roof, and it is a reconstruction. The exterior of the structure is clad
with wood siding, and all of the windows appear
to be double-hung wood windows. The majority
are single pane windows, but in the rear there are
several small three-over-one pane windows. The
residence is raised, and a brick chain wall is visible around the perimeter of the building. Substantial changes to the structure include a carport

the current owner has lived in the region since
the late nineteenth century and in the vicinity
of Locus G032307b-01 since at least 1910, the
readily available background research regarding
this builder/owner family does not connect the

Isolated Find F032607c-01
Type: Prehistoric Period isolated find
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Isolated Find F032607c-01 was identified
during pedestrian survey within the proposed
Gulf Crossing Project survey corridor. It occupies
a broad, flat terrace overlooking an ephemeral
drainage to the south and east (Figure 7.36). The
locus measures no more than 20 m (32.8 ft) in diameter and it was recorded along Transect I of the
survey corridor. A single aboriginal lithic artifact
was recovered from Isolated Find F032607C-01.
This artifact was identified as a piece of chert
debitage that was recovered from Stratum II. No
temporally diagnostic materials were identified as
the result of investigations at this cultural locus.
Surface exposure was poor at the locus due
to extensive groundcover; an additional four delineation shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of the isolated lithic recovery; these tests
failed to identify any further cultural materials.
Given this, and the lack of additional artifact recoveries, Isolated Find F032607c-01 does not

ridge at the headwaters of an ephemeral drainage.
The locus measured no more than 10 m (32.8 ft)
in diameter and it was recorded along the western
edge of a two-track trail that follows along the
ridge crest (Figure 7.35). Only a single historic
ceramic sherd was identified, recovered from
Stratum I of the sole positive shovel test. This
sherd was identified as being Albany slip stoneware, which has a production date range of ca.
1805 to 1920.
Additional delineation shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the isolated sherd failed to
identify any subsurface component to this locus.

pedestrian survey and shovel testing program associated with the current undertaking found both
prehistoric and historic artifacts within the area.
Despite pedestrian survey and shovel testing, artifacts were not found west of the existing pipeline
corridor during the current Gulf Crossing Phase I
investigation, where the Texas Site Atlas places
Site 41FN40. The artifacts recovered during the
current survey were limited to the east side of the
pipeline corridor. For that reason, its GPS plotted
position and the predominance of prehistoric materials, the newly recovered materials associated
with Site 41FN41.
As defined by the current Phase I investigation, Site 41FN41 is situated on a slight ridge
within the broad Red River floodplain; it is irregular in plan view but measures roughly 80 m by
80m (262.5 ft by 262.5 ft) in extent (Figure 7.38).
The nearest natural drainage is a small ephemeral
stream that is over 200 m (656 ft) away. All of
the artifacts identified during this Phase I survey
were found to the east of the currently proposed
alignment of the Gulf Crossing pipeline, within
the additional survey area shown in Appendix I.
The Phase I investigations at Site 41FN41
resulted in the recovery of 27 artifacts from the
surface and from four excavated shovel tests (Tables 7.32 to 7.34). The recoveries were classified
as aboriginal lithics (n=19), aboriginal ceramics (n=1), and historic/modern materials (n=7).
The aboriginal lithic artifacts included two lithic
tools: a quartzite hammerstone recovered from
the surface (Figure 7.3a) and an expedient unifa-

collected between 30 and 40 cm (11.8 to 15.8 in)
below surface. The remaining lithic artifacts were
sorted as agate/chalcedony (n=1), chert (n=14),
and silicified sandstone (n=2) debitage. The single aboriginal ceramic artifact consisted of an
undecorated grit/grog-tempered ceramic sherd.
None of the prehistoric artifacts recovered from
Site 41FN41 were temporally diagnostic and
were recovered in low numbers from the surface
to 40 cm (15.8 in) below surface.
The historic/modern materials recovered
from this locus consisted of both historic period ceramics (n=5) and glass (n=2). The historic
ceramics were sorted as plain ironstone (n=5),
which can be dated ca. 1842 to 1930 (2). The
glass artifacts consisted of colorless (n=1) and
manganese solarized (n=1) bottle glass shards.
Colorless glass generally post-dates 1870 (www.

blm.gov/historic_bottles/index.htm), while manga-

nese solarized glass has a production range of
ca. 1875 to 1920 (Lockhart 2006). No evidence
of a feature or structural remains was identified
within the area during the surface examination or
subsurface testing program.
While artifacts were recovered up to 40 cm
(15.8 in) below surface, the number of artifacts
identified within the area is low and the site is situated within a field that has received considerable
disturbance through agricultural plowing and use
as cattle pasture. These factors indicate that the
research potential of the site is limited. As a result, Site 41FN41 does not possess the qualities
of significance as defined by the National Register of Historic Places Criteria for Evaluation (36
CFR 60.4 [a-d]). In addition, all of the artifacts
identified during the survey lie east of the currently proposed Gulf Crossing pipeline alignment

Site 41FN83 is a new archeological site that
was identified during subsurface testing of an alternative Gulf Crossing pipeline route; the pipeline alignment was subsequently shifted to the
west and the site therefore no longer lies within
the Area of Potential Effect. The site currently
measures approximately 75 m (246 ft) in diameter and it is located on a slight rise within the

artifacts (n=33) are grouped as fragments of clear
melted glass that were recovered from a single
shovel test. With this exception, the site exhibits
relatively low artifact density. There is no evidence of structural remains or features present at
the site.
Based on the type of artifacts recovered, the
site likely represents the remains of a destroyed
domestic habitation or refuse event. Given the
close temporal overlap between the recovered artifacts and the number of friable items, the depth
of the recoveries is interpreted as resulting from
landform disturbance, likely plowing, rather than
being indicative of intact stratigraphy. In conjunction with the lack of structural remains at the site,
it is believed that the portion of Site 41FN83 that
lies within the assessed corridor does not possess
the required qualities of significance for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places (36
CFR 60.4 [d]). In addition, Site 41FN82 no lon-

1842 and 1930 (Miller et al. 2000). Glass artifacts included colorless (n=9), aqua (n=2), and
manganese solarized (n=2) bottle/container glass
shards. Of these, a total of 3 glass shards could
be classified as machine-made glass, which provides a date range of ca. 1903 to present (Miller
et al. 2000), while the manganese solarized glass
shards date ca. 1875 to 1920 (Lockhart 2006).
Additional glass artifacts included amorphous
melted glass fragments (n=38), small untyped
glass shards (n=4), and aqua-tinted window glass
fragments (n=3). Ferrous metal artifacts included
1 wire (common ca. 1885-present; Markell et al.
1999) and 4 untyped nail fragments, as well as 2
unidentified metal fragments.
All of the artifacts were recovered from
subsurface contexts, with the great majority (68
of 70; 97 percent) coming from less than 30 cm
(11.8 in) below surface. The greatest number of

hilltop that is approximately 100 m (328 ft) from
the nearest creek within the broad alluvial floodplain. A wetland is located 50 m (165 ft) to the
north of the site. Ground visibility was poor due
to forest and ground vegetation cover.
Artifacts recovered from Site 41FN84 (Table 7.36) consisted exclusively of historic/modern material (n=28). These were sorted by material type as brick (n=1), historic ceramic (n=1),
glass (n=19), and ferrous metal (n=7). The single
artifact that could be associated with a discrete
time range was a plain ironstone sherd, which
dates from ca. 1842-1930 (Miller et al. 2000).
Glass artifacts consisted of colorless (n=3), aqua

fragments (n=4). Of these, the manganese solarized glass provide a production date of ca. 1875
to 1920 (Lockhart 2006). Ferrous metal artifacts
were sorted as cut (n=1) (common ca. 17901890; Markell et al. 1999), wire (n=2) (common
ca. 1885-present; Markell et al. 1999), and untyped (n=2) nails, a crown type bottle cap (1892present; Miller et al. 2000), and an amorphous
metal fragment (n=1). All of the materials were
collected from two shovel tests at depths up to
20 cm (7.9 in) below surface. There was no visible evidence of structures or features within the
area.
Site 41FN84 most likely represents the
scattered remains of a destroyed early to midtwentieth century domestic residence. The few
artifacts recovered and the absence of any associ-

ated structural remains indicate that the historical context of the site has been impacted significantly. As a result, Site 41FN84 does not possess
the qualities of significance as defined by the
National Register of Historic Places criteria for
evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). In addition, the
site is located outside of the Gulf Crossing Area
of Potential Effect due to a route adjustment. No
additional testing of this site is recommended for
the undertaking.

glass. Of these, a total of 9 glass shards were identified as originating from machine-made bottles
or other containers, which provide a date range
of ca. 1903 to present (Miller et al. 2000). Other
glass artifacts included untyped amber (n=1) and
manganese solarized (n=1) glass shards, melted
glass fragments (n=2), and an aqua glass electrical insulator fragment. The single ferrous metal
artifact was classified as a single cut nail (common ca. 1790-1890; Markell et al. 1999).
The artifacts were limited to surface and
near-surface (under 10 cm [3.9 in] below surface) contexts. The great majority of specimens
(n=21, 75 percent) were fragments of various
glass items. No surface features such as structural
foundations were observed, although a nearby
well and the types of artifacts encountered at the
site suggest that a structure was once present. Site

of a destroyed nineteenth century domestic residence. The low density of the artifacts and the

Type: Historic Period (19th century) artifact scatter
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Site 41LR356 is new archeological site that
was identified during pedestrian survey and shovel testing of a now-abandoned route of the Gulf
Crossing pipeline corridor. The site measures
roughly 45 by 50 m (147.6 by 165 ft) in extent
and is irregular in plan (Figure 7.41). There is no
water source in close proximity except for an excavated well. The land is currently cattle pasture
but appears to have previously been cleared for
residential purposes. Ground visibility was relatively poor due to the current grass cover.
The cultural resources survey resulted in
the recovery of 28 historic/modern artifacts from
Site 41LR356 (Table 7.38). These materials were
typed as historic ceramic (n=6), glass (n=21), and
ferrous metal (n=1). The historic ceramics were
identified as plain ironstone (n=1) (ca. 1842-1930;
Miller et al. 2000), blue transfer printed porcelain
(n=1) (ca. 1760-present; Miller et al. 2000), and

of the cemetery are fenced and well-identified;
this will be adequate for avoidance during construction of the Gulf Crossing pipeline.
Although Cemetery LR-CO49 is located
outside of the Area of Potential Effect, R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates field personnel
recorded all legible grave markers within the
cemetery. There were a total of seven rows visible and sixteen graves which could be accurately
identified. The majority of the graves date the late
nineteenth century, with the earliest marker being
for Daniel M. Price (1801-1865). The most recent
grave marker is for Hardin William Long (18591936), indicating that the cemetery stopped being used shortly before World Word II. While the
grounds of the cemetery have been maintained,
recent vandalism has apparently occurred at the
site. A majority of the grave markers have been
moved from their original position, with many
being damaged during the process (Figures 7.43
and 7.44).

courses are in close proximity to the location. The
locus measures no more than 20 m (65.6 ft) in
diameter based on the lack of additional artifact
recoveries from the area (Figure 7.45).
The locus was characterized by the surface
recovery of a single shard of solarized manganese glass, which was accidentally lost during the
field recordation process (Table 7.39). Solarized
glass was predominantly manufactured between
1875 and 1920 (Lockhart 2006). Shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the surface find failed to
locate any additional cultural materials. The lack
of artifact recoveries indicates that little research

Site 41FK123 (Temp. ID PW032407a-01)
Type: Historic Period (19th to 20th century) artifact scatter
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Site 41FK123 is a new archeological site that
was identified during pedestrian survey of a nowabandoned proposed route of the Gulf Crossing
pipeline corridor. The site currently measures
roughly 80 by 40 m (262.4 by 13.2 ft) in extent
and it is irregular in plan (Figure 7.47). There is
no water source in close proximity. The land is
currently farm land and cattle pasture and has a
dirt road running through the southern portion.
The northern boundary of the site could not be
determined as it lies outside of the corridor for
which survey permission was granted.
Ground visibility was generally poor but the
artifacts were often easily observed due to their
large size. Only a sample of the available artifacts
were collected for analysis; all were of historic/
modern materials (n=159; Table 7.41). By material type these were sorted as brick (n=1), historic
ceramic (n=67), glass (n=79), cupreous metal
(n=1), ferrous metal (n=9), lead (n=1), and synthetic (n=1). The historic ceramic artifacts consisted of plain ironstone (n=2) (ca. 1842-1930;
Miller et al. 2000), plain soft-paste porcelain
(n=7) (common ca. 1850-present; Markell et al.

were various subtypes of stoneware, which were
classified as Albany slip (n=2) (ca. 1805-1920;

one or two room dwelling (Figure 7.53). Rectangular in plan and one story in height, it is clad
with weathered wood siding and has a tin roof that
extends over a narrow porch. A single window
opening (with a missing window) is visible on
the side gable exterior wall. Visibility was limited
at the time of recordation, but the profile of the
structure resembles temporary worker housing of
the early twentieth century, which was commonly
built by the lumber industry and moved from location to location as workers clear cut forests.
While the feature at Structure F032507a01 appears to be architecturally undistinguished
and may not possess integrity of location, at this
time not enough information exists to make an
eligibility recommendation. It is located outside
of the currently proposed environmental survey
corridor and therefore also outside the project’s
Area of Potential Effect. Should the alignment
change so that this resource would be affected
by construction, it is recommended that further
Phase I fieldwork be conducted at the structure to
determine its NRHP-eligibility.

Isolated Find G032207a-01
Type: Prehistoric Period isolated find
NRHP Assessment: Not Assessed (Outside Survey Corridor)
The current Phase I cultural resource survey identified Isolated Find G032207a-01 during pedestrian survey of the proposed Gulf South
Project corridor. The locus, which is estimated to
measure no more than 20 m (131.2 ft) in diameter, is located at the northern edge of the existing
cleared pipeline right-of-way (Figure 7.54). The
locus is on the north side of a hillside, south of
a creek. Shovel tests that were excavated in the
undisturbed wooded area that lies directly south
of the isolated recovery failed to identify any additional cultural material. The artifact was not
collected as it lay within the extant pipeline rightof-way. It consisted of a single unmodified flake.
No other artifacts were observed on the ground
surface.
The lack of artifacts recovered from a secure
context at Isolated Find G032207a-01 indicates
that little research potential exists at the area. For

this reason, the portion lying within the assessed
survey corridor does not posses the qualities of
significance as defined by the National Register
of Historic Places Criteria for Evaluation (36
CFR 60.4 [a-d]). This cultural resource also lies
outside of the currently defined Area of Potential
Effect due to a route change.and it thus will not
be adversely affected by the current undertaking. In the event that a route adjustment occurs to
the unassessed northern side of the extant pipeline corridor, additional Phase I cultural resource
fieldwork is recommended to fully assess any artifacts in the area.

area, the artifact was not collected and the location was not intensively surveyed. A GPS position of the cultural find was taken using a Trimble
unit and it has been plotted on USGS topographic
maps that are being provided under separate cover
to the Texas Historic Commission and the FERC.
Isolated Find G032207B-01 is located outside of the currently proposed environmental survey corridor and therefore also outside the Gulf
Crossing Project area. Full examination of the
locus was not possible and no evaluation of its
NRHP eligibility can currently be made. In the
event that a route adjustment occurs that places
the location in conflict with the proposed development, additional Phase I cultural resource fieldwork is recommended to fully assess the artifacts
that are present in the area.

Isolated Find G032207B-01
Type: Prehistoric Period Isolated Find
NRHP Assessment: Not Assessed (Outside Survey Corridor)
Isolated Find G032207B-01 was identified
during pedestrian survey of the proposed Gulf

ground exposures that were present in an area
adjacent to the existing cleared pipeline right-ofway in Franklin County. As landowner approval
had not been granted for an examination of the

end wall of the original structure. The structure
is abandoned and partially collapsed, with missing doors and windows. A combination of brick
piers and wood support the intact portions of the
structure.
Structure G032307A-01 has been substantially altered, and does not possess integrity of
materials, design or workmanship. Therefore, it
does not possess the qualities of significance as
defined by the National Register of Historic Places criteria for evaluation (36CFR 60.4 [a-d]). It
is also situated outside of the Area of Potential
Effects that is associated with the Gulf Crossing
project. No additional recordation of this structure is recommended.

Historic Structure G032307a-01
Type: Historic Period standing structure
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Structure G032307a-01 consists solely of
a one-story vernacular-style residence, built ca.
1930, and located to the north of the existing
cleared pipeline right-of-way (Figure 7.55). The
structure is located outside of the proposed Gulf
South Project area but could be clearly viewed
from the existing cleared right-of-way. The
structure is positioned on a large knoll overlooking an ephemeral stream to the south and east.
L-shaped in plan, the structure appears to be
in poor condition. Tar paper (which appears to
have been recently installed) is the primary cladding material on the one-story frame structure,
but plywood and particleboard can also be seen.
The original portion of the small structure is gabled, and what appears to be a side addition has
a shed roof. Both roofs are sheathed with an asphalt material. A chimney is present on the gable

resentative sample of the cultural materials that
were observed on the ground surface, 39 artifacts
in total (Table 7.43). All of the artifacts consisted exclusively of historic/modern materials. By
material class, these were sorted as brick (n=1),
historic ceramic (n=11), combination (n=1), glass
(n=24), and untyped metal (n=2). The single brick
artifact was a machine-made and partially glazed
brick with “ATLANTA/TEXAS” stamped on
one face. On the brick, both the “N” and the “S”
were stamped in reverse, which matches a brick
illustrated by Steinbomer (1982: Brick 360) from
the Atlanta Brick Company in Cass County, ca.
1915-1940. Historic ceramic artifacts consisted
of soft-paste porcelain (n=3), unglazed porcelain
bisque (n=1), stoneware (n=2), and whiteware
(n=5). Included in this sample were a whiteware
plate sherd with a late blue transfer printed floral
design (Figure 7.57b), a pink/rose colored “Fiesta
Ware” lid (Figure 7.57c), an unglazed porcelain
bisque female child figurine head (Figure 7.57d),
rim and lid portions of a stoneware butter churn
(Figure 7.58a-b), and a soft-paste porcelain bowl
sherd with blue transfer printed design (Figure
7.57a).

Site 41CS335 (Temp. ID E032307a-01)
Type: Historic Period (20th century) artifact scatter
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Site 41CS335 was first identified within a
recently logged, broad ridge during the current
Phase I investigation; extensive disturbance as a
result of the timber harvesting activities and access road construction provided excellent ground
surface visibility (Figure 7.56). The pedestrian
survey resulted in cultural material being recovered from an extensive surface area, but only a
single excavated shovel test contained artifacts.
In general, the site was characterized as a surface
and subsurface scatterof historic ceramics, glass,
brick, plastic and metal. No water courses are located in the close vicinity.
A very large number of artifacts were observed scattered within the site area, with several
areas of concentration also noted. Based on the
dirt piles present, these areas of artifact constgruction obviously result from heavy machinery
displacement during the timber harvesting process. The Phase I field study collected only a rep181

the wood frame structure is clad with horizontal
lapped siding that appears to be wood. Its roof
is side-gabled. A damaged brick chimney can be
seen in the center of the gable end wall of the
structure. The chimney is unusually tall and narrow, suggesting that the structure may have been
moved from another location, and the chimney reconstructed at a later date. The residence is raised
on a concrete block foundation. A collapsed log
outbuilding (Figure 7.60) built ca. 1900 or earlier,
is also on the property. Its roof appears to have
last been sheathed with metal, and a wood stove
and horse plow are visible among the debris.
While the residence and outbuilding at
Structure C031407a-01 appear to be lacking in
integrity of materials and design, as well as architecturally undistinguished, a full view of the
details of the bungalow-style residence was not
available as it was positioned outside of the survey corridor, where landowner permission had
not been granted. At this time, not enough information exists to make an eligibility recommendation. Currently the structures lie outside of the

Site 41LR124, a low-density surface scatter
of lithics and fire cracked rock, is recorded on the
Texas Site Atlas as lying within the southern portion of the preferred Gulf Crossing Pipeline corridor. However, based on observations made during
the current investigation the site is situated on a
small terrace, outside and to the south of the Gulf
Crossing environmental survey corridor. Initially
identified through pedestrian reconnaissance and
limited shovel testing (i.e. 3 shovel tests) in 1988,
the site measured 10 m (32.81 ft) x 80 m (262.47
ft). It was located in a pasture, approximately 400
m (1312.3 ft) from a creek, on a small terrace.
The area was overgrown with short grasses, and
secondary oak trees. Soils in the area consisted of
silty loam, with some ridge slope erosion noted.
Direct impacts to the site included clearing, and
previous cultivation. This site was classified as a
prehistoric site of unknown cultural affiliation.
Site 41LR124 consisted of a surface and subsurface artifact scatter. The depths of the cultural
deposits within the site were estimated to extend
from the surface to 25 cmbs. Although no artifacts were noted in the area, previous investigators suggested that the site might extend the full
area of the small terrace, located south and west

within the project’s Area of Potential Effect, it is
recommended that further research be conducted
to determine its National Register significance.
Previously Recorded Sites Not Identified by
the Current Investigation
The following section briefly presents information on archeological sites that are mapped on
the GIS Texas Site Atlas as lying within, or directly adjacent to, the preferred project corridor, but
which were not relocated during the current field
investigation. The re-identification of these sites
was a primary research objective of the current
Phase I undertaking, however, no evidence was
found that the sites discussed below are located
within the Gulf Crossing Area of Potential Effect.
These descriptions are provided in the unlikely
event that cultural materials are encountered at
these locations during construction and the Unanticipated Discovery Plan is enacted. The precise
locations of these resources are shown in Appendix I of the report copies on file at TARL and the
Texas Historical Commission. The information
used for the following discussion was provided
on each state site inventory form that was on file
at TARL.

of the identified site limits. This location, however, would still place the site outside the current
project right-of-way. Site 41LR124 was located
in an area of disturbance, and consequently it was
assessed as not significant according to the Criteria of eligibility (36 CFR 60.4 [d]) and additional
work was not recommended.
Site 41LR129 is plotted at the northern edge
of a now-abandoned route of the Gulf Crossing
Pipeline. The site, which measured it measured
50 m by 60 m (164 ft by 196.8 ft) was identified
on an elevated knoll approximately 150 m (492
ft) from Brushy Creek. The site is apparently
restricted to the crest of the knoll as no cultural
material was found outside the higher elevations.
The site was classified as a low-density, multiple
component surface and subsurface artifact scatter
of unknown cultural affiliation. The depths of the
recovered artifacts ranged from the surface to 30
cmbs. Two flakes and one nail were found within
the three positive shovel tests, while flakes, firecracked rock, whiteware, and earthenware sherds
were found on the surface of an adjacent road.
This road is used to access an existing transmission line that bisects the site. This site was assessed as being potentially significant according
to the criteria of eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d].
Site 41LR133 is plotted as being within the
northeastern edge of the preferred Gulf Crossing
pipeline corridor. The site, which measures 75 m
(246 ft) in extent, was identified within a plowed
agricultural field during a Phase Investigation
conducted in 1989 for the Texoma pipeline project. The field techniques used included pedestrian
survey and shovel testing. The site is situated on
a slight rise and was not near any natural water
course. The site was interpreted as being the remains of a nineteenth to twentieth century house
site based on the presence of a small brick scatter
surrounded by artifacts of glass, metal, brick and
ceramic sherds. The observed items also included
square nails, glass bottles, and possible metal stove
parts. A concentration of artifacts was noted east of
the existing pipeline right-of-way. Site 41LR133
was assessed as not being eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41RR199, named the J. W. Allison Site,
was first discovered in 1988 during a Phase I cul-

tural resources survey conducted for the Southern
Interconnect Pipeline project. Identified within a
flower field, the site measured 90 m (295.3 ft) by
40 m (131.2 ft) in size and is situated approximately 400 m (1312.3 ft) southwest of a large water source. Pedestrian survey augmented by the
excavation of two shovel tests led to the recovery
of fire-cracked rock, lithic debitage, and prehistoric ceramic sherds, all of which originated from
the surface of site; no subsurface deposits were
identified. The site has been classified as an open
campsite of an unknown affiliation, however the
recorder points out that the site area appears to
have been under cultivation for a long period,
suggesting a high degree of disturbance to any
cultural deposits. Although the site was assessed
as being not significant when applying National
Register of Historic Places criteria of eligibility
(36 CFR 60.4 [d]), the recorder recommended
additional subsurface testing to determine if intact cultural deposits exist below the plow zone.
The site is located to the south and outside of an
surveyed but abandoned corridor of the proposed
Gulf Crossing pipeline.
Site 41FK75 is plotted on the Texas Site
Atlas as being positioned inside the southern
portion of the preferred Gulf Crossing Project
corridor. First discovered in 1988 during the
Phase I cultural resources survey of the Southern Interconnect Pipeline Project, the site was
classified as a surface and subsurface scatter
of both prehistoric and historic artifacts. The
site, which measured 70 m (229.7 ft) by 140
m (459.3 ft), was located along a low trending
ridge within the drainage basin of a large river.
The site was positioned near an occupied house,
and observed vegetation included forbs, grasses,
and a Chinaberry tree. Cultural materials were
recovered from depths ranging from the surface
to 15 cmbs, and recovered artifacts included
brick fragments, square and round nails, earthenware, bone, whiteware, various glass shards,
fire-cracked rock, and lithic flakes. In addition,
two cultural features were recorded: a well
and a small depression that may represent the
remains of a root cellar. The recorder assessed
the site as potentially significant when applying
the National Register of Historic Places criteria
of eligibility (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]), and recom187

Pipeline project in 1988. Pedestrian survey augmented by systematic shovel testing revealed that
the site was located within a hardwood forest
along the north slope of an unnamed drainage.
The site had been exposed to a small amount of
erosional disturbance. Although 30 indeterminate lithic flakes were recovered from the site,
all artifacts originated from a single shovel test
at depths that varied from the surface to 38 cmbs
(15.0 inbs). Plotted within the northern edge of
the preferred Gulf Crossing Pipeline Corridor,
Site 41FK89 was assessed as potentially significant when applying National Register of Historic
Places criteria of eligibility (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d])
and avoidance was recommended.
Site 41TT557, the W. M. Armstrong Site, was
discovered during the Phase I cultural resources
survey of the Southern Interconnect Pipeline in
1988. Pedestrian survey augmented with systematic shovel testing determined the site extent to
measure 210 by 80 m (689.0 by 262.5 ft). Located on a sandy rise along a creek bank, the site occupied a cleared area consisting of grasses, forbs,
and sedge. Characterized as a possible prehistoric
open campsite of unknown cultural affiliation,
the recovered artifacts included an unspecified
amount of lithic debitage and fire-cracked rock
that was recovered from depths ranging from 0 to
50 cmbs (0 to 19.7 inbs). Assessed as potentially
significant applying the National Register of Historic Places criteria of eligibility (36 CFR 60.4
[d]), the site is plotted outside but immediately to
the south of the preferred Gulf Crossing Pipeline
corridor.
Site 41TT559, the Major Farris Site, is located outside but immediately north of the preferred
Gulf Crossing Pipeline corridor. It was identified
during the Phase I study of the Southern Interconnect Pipeline project. The multicomponent site
was identified along the crest and sides of a small
ridge. The site, which measured 100 by 80 m
(328.1 by 262.5 ft) in size, was situated immediately west of an unnamed drainage and observed
vegetation was limited to grasses and occasional
hardwood trees. Shovel testing and pedestrian
survey led to the recovery of both historic and
prehistoric period artifacts. The recovered prehistoric artifacts included four indeterminate lithic

mended avoidance if possible, or test excavations if avoidance was not feasible.
Site 41FK76, the W. A. Lewis #1 Site, is
plotted as being within the southern portion of the
preferred Gulf Crossing Project corridor. It was
first discovered during the pedestrian survey and
shovel testing of the Southern Interconnect Pipeline Project corridor, which occurred in 1988. The
site measured 150 m (492.1 ft) by 140 m (459.3
ft) and was classified as an open campsite and
lithic procurement location of an unknown cultural affiliation. Situated within a pasture along a
low ridge top, the site was identified in the vicinity of a dammed tributary of a large river. Artifacts were recovered from both surface and subsurface contexts, and included fire-cracked rock,
lithic debitage, and lithic cores. Site 41FK76 was
assessed by the recorder as being not significant
when applying the National Register of Historic
Places criteria of eligibility (36 CFR 60.4 [d]).
Site 41FK85, also referred to as the W. M.
Birdwell #1 Site, measured approximately 105 m
(344.5 ft) by 60 m (196.9 ft), and is plotted within
the northern portion of the preferred Gulf Crossing Pipeline. First discovered along a low ridge
top during the 1988 Phase I cultural resources
survey of the Southern Interconnect Pipeline,
the site is situated within the drainage basin of a
large river. Observed vegetation at the site area
included mixed hardwoods, grasses, and forbs,
and disturbance factors included erosion and vehicular traffic associated with a road located in
the middle of the site. Cultural material was recovered from Site 41FK85 at depths that ranged
from 0 to 57 cmbs and included three prehistoric ceramic sherds, one core, and an unspecified
number of lithic flakes. Based on the recovery of
the ceramics, the site was classified as a possible
Late Caddoan or Titus phase prehistoric open
campsite, with a cultural affiliation to the phases.
The recorder assessed Site 41FK85 as potentially
significant when applying the National Register
of Historic Places criteria of eligibility (36 CFR
60.4 [d]) and recommended avoidance.
Site 41FK89, the W. M. Birdwell #5 Site,
measured 40 m (131.2 ft) by 45 m (147.6 ft) and
was first discovered during the Phase I cultural
resources survey of the Southern Interconnect

flakes, while the collected historic artifacts consisted of three shards of solarized glass (ca. 1880
to 1920); additional historic building materials
(i.e., broken concrete blocks and a tin roof) were
observed but not collected. Site 41TT559 was assessed as being potentially significant when applying the National Register of Historic Places
criteria of eligibility (36 CFR 60.4 [d]). A combination of additional archival research and site
avoidance was recommended.
Site 41TT560 is plotted on the Texas Site Atlas as within the currently proposed Gulf Crossing Pipeline coridor. Identified during the 1988
Phase I cultural resources survey of the Southern
Interconnect Pipeline, the prehistoric period site is
located west of a creek and is covered by grasses
and mixed woods. Measuring 60 by 50 m (196.9
by 164.0 ft) in total extent, a pedestrian survey
coupled with the excavation of three shovel tests
led to the recovery of two core fragments, one
indeterminate lithic flake, and the base of a possible Late Archaic Period projectile point/knife;
the latter was found on the surface. Site 41TT560
was assessed as not significant when applying the
National Register of Historic Places criteria of
eligibility (36 CFR 60.4 [d]) and no further work
was recommended.
Site 41TT562, which measured 100 by 35 m
(328.1 by 114.8 ft) in total extent, was identified
outside but immediately south of the preferred
Gulf Crossing Pipeline corridor. Discovered in
1988 during the Phase I cultural resources inventory of the Southern Interconnect Pipeline, the site
was characterized as a low density subsurface scatter of prehistoric materials. Situated along a small
rise, the site occupies a broad floodplain adjacent
to a nearby water source. Vegetation at the site
consisted of grasses, scrub oak, and brushy weeds.
Prehistoric Period artifacts were recovered from 0
to 45 cm (0 to 17.7 in) below surface. A total of
three positive shovel tests resulted in the recovery
of 12 lithic flakes, one core fragment, one fragment
of fire-cracked rock, one ceramic sherd, and one
piece of baked clay; none of these materials were
temporally diagnostic, however. The remains of a
possible Late Caddoan occupation, Site 41TT562
was assessed as being potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places;
preservation of the site was recommended.

Site 41TT566, which measured 150 m (492.1
ft) in diameter is located outside but immediately
north of the preferred Gulf Crossing Pipeline corridor. It was first discovered in 1988, during the
Phase I cultural resources survey of the Southern
Interconnect Pipeline project. The site was identified on the crest of a small ridge top overlooking
the floodplain of a major creek. Vegetation observed at the site, which appeared to have experienced minor erosion, included grasses, pines,
and oaks. Pedestrian survey augmented by the
excavation of shovel tests led to the recovery of
prehistoric artifacts from both surface and subsurface contexts up to 20 cmbs (7.9 inbs). Recovered
artifacts, which included lithic flakes, cores, and
bone and grog tempered ceramics, suggest that
the site may date from the Early Ceramic to Late
Caddoan Periods. The site was assessed as potentially significant applying the National Register
of Historic Places criteria of eligibility (36 CFR
60.4 [d]) and preservation was recommended.
Site 41TT569 is located to the north of the
proposed Gulf Crossing pipeline corridor. It was
first discovered in 1988, during the Southern Interconnect Pipeline survey. The site area, which
measures 40 by 60 m (131.2 by 196.9 ft), was
observed to be covered with a mixture of grasses and oak trees. The site is in close proximity
to two creeks. Pedestrian survey, augmented by
shovel testing, led to the recovery of both prehistoric and historic period artifacts. The prehistoric
artifact assemblage included three flakes of petrified wood recovered from the ground surface,
while the historic artifact assemblage was limited
to one shard of snuff bottle glass, which was recovered from a depth of 0 to 10 cmbs (0 to 3.9
inbs). Classified as a site with both early twentieth century farmstead/homestead and indeterminate prehistoric period components, the site was
assessed as being not significant for when applying the National Register of Historic Places criteria of eligibility (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No further
work was recommended.
Site 41TT644, the E Piney Site, was recorded
in 1991 by the Texas Historical Commission. The
site, plotted as being within the northern edge of
the preferred Gulf Crossing Pipeline survey corridor, consists of prehistoric lithic and ceramic
artifacts that were recovered by the landowner on
189

the existing pipeline right-of-way. The site was
identified within a stand of secondary growth
hardwood trees. The recorder notes that little is
known about the site other than its location and
recommends that Site 41TT644 be assessed for
its National Register of Historic Places eligibility.
Additional recommendations included testing to
assess the level of damage to the site from pipeline construction and photodocumentation of the
materials recovered from the site.
Site 41CS135, which measured 40 m by 25
m (131.2 by 82 ft) in extent, is plotted on the Texas Site Atlas within the southern edge of the preferred Gulf Crossing Pipeline corridor. It was first
discovered in 1988, during the Phase I cultural
resources survey of the Southern Interconnect
Pipeline project. The site was identified as three
mounds located on a flat bench directly adjacent
to the east side of Highway 250. A circular feature
of hematite was interpreted as a filled-in well.
Vegetation observed at the site included pasture
grasses. Pedestrian survey augmented by the excavation of shovel tests led to the recovery of historic glass, whiteware and nails from the surface
and two shovel tests. No structural or foundation
remains were evident other than the mounds. Although no intact structural remains were present
and were interpreted as being dismantled, the researchers assessed the site as potentially eligible
for listing to the National Register of Historic
Places. Its avoidance during pipeline construction
was recommended.
Site 41CS140 also was discovered in 1988
during the Southern Interconnect Pipeline project
survey. The site, which just outside the northern
edge of the preferred Gulf Crossing Project cor-

ridor, was located on a broad ridge surrounded
by pine and oak forest and near an intermittent
creek. It includes a number of architectural features, such as a well and possible foundation.
Shovel testing and pedestrian survey led to the
recovery of late nineteenth to early twentieth
century artifacts from both surface and subsurface contexts. The artifacts recovered included
window and bottle glass shards, an unspecified
number of whiteware sherds, and one stoneware
sherd. The site measures approximately 60 by 90
m (196.9 by 295.3 ft) and is covered by a mixture
of grasses and weeds. Assessed as being potentially eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, avoidance and additional
archival research were recommended for Site
41CS140.
Site 41CS141, which lies outside but close
to the northern edge of the preferred Gulf Crossing Pipeline corridor, was identified as a result of
the Phase I inventory conducted for the Southern Interconnect Pipeline project. A possible
Late Caddoan Period campsite, it measured 55
by 70 m (180.5 by 230.0 ft) in extent and was
comprised of a subsurface scatter of lithic flakes,
burnt bone, daub, and one prehistoric ceramic
sherd. The site was identified along a ridge top,
approximately 1.8 to 2.4 m (6 to 8 ft) above the
floodplain of a creek. Vegetation observed at the
site included grasses, sweetgum, and pines. In addition, erosional disturbance and bioturbation was
noted. Site 41CS141 was assessed as potentially
significant when applying the National Register
of Historic Places criteria of evaluation (36 CFR
60.4 [a-d]), and preservation of the site was recommended.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

G

ulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC is
filing an application for a Certificate of
Public Convenience and Necessity with
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC), for authorization to construct and operate the Gulf Crossing Project. The project is a proposal to construct approximately 568.4 km (353.2
mi) of 42-inch outside diameter natural gas pipeline within the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and
Louisiana; approximately 221.6 km (137.7 mi) of
the pipeline is to be located in Texas. Between
January and June of 2007, a Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory was
completed for the proposed project in Grayson,
Fannin, Lamar, Delta, Hopkins, Franklin, Titus,
Morris, and Cass Counties, Texas. This Phase I
cultural resources survey and architectural inventory report is intended to provide relevant information to the Texas Historical Commission (State
Historic Preservation Office) and the FERC to
assist those agencies in conducting their Section
106 review of the undertaking.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, requires
the lead federal agency with jurisdiction over a
federal, federally-assisted, or federally-licensed
undertaking to consider impacts to historic properties before undertaking a project. A historic
property is defined as any prehistoric or historic
district, archeological site, building, structure, or
object included in, or eligible for, inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The
implementing regulation of Section 106, issued
by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), is 36 CFR Part 800. The regulation
establishes a process for identifying cultural resources that may be impacted by an undertaking
and evaluating the eligibility of these properties
for listing on the NRHP; assessing the effects of
an undertaking on cultural resources determined
to be historic properties; and consultation for

methods to avoid, reduce, or mitigate any adverse
effects to NRHP-listed or eligible properties. Adverse effects include, but are not limited to, destruction or alteration of all or part of a property;
isolation from or alteration of its surrounding
environment; introduction of visual, audible, or
atmospheric elements that are out of character
with the property or that alter its setting; transfer or sale of a federally owned property without adequate conditions or restrictions regarding
preservation, maintenance, or use; and neglect of
a property resulting in its deterioration or destruction (36 CFR 800.5).
The field effort was designed to identify and
to evaluate all cultural resources that were situated in lands that may be impacted as a result of
this undertaking, the project’s Area of Potential
Effects. While the anticipated construction corridor for the project is generally not expected to exceed 30.5 m (100 ft), the Phase I study examined
an environmental survey corridor of either 91.5
m (300 ft; collocated) or 106.7 m (350 ft; greenfield) width; this was intended to accommodate
any additional temporary workspace needs and
allow for minor pipeline route adjustments. Fieldwork consisted of pedestrian survey augmented
by systematic shovel testing; all accessible portions of the Areas of Potential Effect were examined for cultural resources. Approximately 211.8
km (131.6 mi) of the proposed pipeline route (96
percent) was surveyed for cultural resources, as
were the proposed Sherman and Paris Compressor Stations. The Enterprise and Crosstex meter
stations, along with other planned project facilities listed in Table 7.3, are scheduled either to be
built within the footprint of the two compressor
stations or within the limits of the surveyed environmental corridor. Currently, 9.8 km (6.1 mi)
of the corridor remains unassessed (Table 7.1);
the unsurveyed lands will be inventoried and reported after land access has been granted to Gulf

Crossing Pipeline Company LLC. An additional
39.8 km (24.7 mi) of abandoned pipeline route
alternatives also were surveyed during the course
of the Phase I investigation.
Additional Phase I survey cultural resource
survey and, where appropriate, geoarcheological
investigations, will be conducted for all remaining unsurveyed portions of the Area of Potential
Effects of the project. These surveys will include
approximately 9.8 km (6.1 mi) of the proposed
42-inch O.D. pipeline corridor, all private access
roads that may require upgrading, and any additional temporary work spaces or above-ground
facility locations that extend outside of the surveyed environmental corridor. These additional
surveys are anticipated to be completed by the
end of 2007 and a supplemental report submitted
to the Texas Historical Commission and FERC
by early 2008.

Where feasible, R. Christopher Goodwin
and Associates, Inc. has provided NRHP eligibility recommendations for the cultural resources
identified during the current investigations. These
recommendations, summarized in Table 8.2 from
the information presented in Chapter VII, have
assessed each cultural resource in relation to the
required qualities of significance as defined by
the National Register of Historic Places criteria
for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). Ten archeological sites within the preferred corridor have
been assessed as not meeting the eligibility requirements for listing in the National Register
and no further work is recommended at these
sites. These sites include 41FN42 and 41FN82
in Franklin County, 41LR357 and 41LR358 in
Lamar County, 41FK90, 41FK91 and 41FK124
in Franklin County, and 41TT564, 41TT878 and
41TT879 in Cass County. The full boundaries of
three of these sites (41LR358 in Lamar County
and 41TT878 and 41TT879 in Titus County)
could not be determined as land permission was
not granted beyond the defined survey corridor.
Additional Phase I cultural resources survey of
these three sites is recommended if project activities will extend outside of the surveyed corridor.
A single cultural resource identified during the
current investigation has been evaluated as being
potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places; it is Site 41FK88 in Franklin
County. Although the location displays evidence of
considerable ground disturbance, a previous Phase
I survey of the site identified a potentially intact
subsurface feature or soil lens, with materials suitable for radiocarbon dating. In addition, both the
current and previous Phase I investigations encountered artifacts potentially dating to the Early
to Middle Caddo Period at the same stratigraphic
level reported for the possible feature. An intact
single component site with features that could be
dated chronometrically could meet the eligibility
requirements for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. In our opinion, Site 41FK88 may
possess the qualities of significance as defined by
the National Register of Historic Places criterion
of evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [d]). Phase II evaluation of the site is therefore recommended if Gulf
Crossing Company intends to utilize this area during construction of the pipeline.

Results of Survey
The total area surveyed for cultural resources in the state of Texas was in the order of 2406
ha (5945 ac), including approximately 211.8 km
(131.6 mi) of the proposed pipeline route, 39.8 km
(24.7 mi) of abandoned pipeline route alternatives
and two compressor station sites measuring 16.2
ha (40 ac) in combined area. Approximately 96
percent of the proposed 42-inch pipeline right-ofway was examined for cultural resources during
the 2007 investigations. The sections remaining
to be surveyed are presented in Table 8.1, which
also shows the width of the environmental survey
corridor used during the Phase I investigation, in
the event that Gulf Crossing requests variances
for additional work space.
A total of 41 new or previously recorded cultural resources were assessed as a result of the
current Phase I cultural resources survey effort
(Table 8.2). These cultural resources consisted of
seven previously recorded archeological sites, 11
newly identified archeological sites, 22 non-site
cultural resource loci, and a single historic cemetery that has not been designated as an archeological site. Of the above cultural resources, 27 are situated within the surveyed environmental corridor,
while 14 now lie outside of the undertaking due to
subsequent changes to the design of the pipeline
route.

Chapter VIII: Summary and Recommendations
Site 41CS137 in Cass County and LR-C049
in Lamar County are both historic cemeteries
with clearly demarcated fenced boundaries. Cemeteries are not automatically considered historic
properties under the National Register of Historic Places criteria of evaluation. The historic
research necessary to determine whether the individuals interred at these cemeteries have the
requisite level of local, state or national significance was not needed for the current undertaking.
The cemetery at LR-C049 lies beyond the outer
edge of the surveyed environmental corridor that
was used during the field study. It therefore lies
outside of the current Gulf Crossing Project area
and will not be adversely affected by the pipeline
construction. The historic family cemetery at Site
41CS137 in Cass County lies within the 91.5 m
(300 ft) environmental survey corridor; however
it is more than 30.5 m (100 ft) from the proposed
Gulf Crossing centerline and therefore lies outside the Area of Potential Effect that is associated
with the construction corridor. To ensure that inadvertent damage does not occur to the site during construction, however, several safety precautions are recommended. First, it is recommended
that Gulf Crossing clearly mark the cemetery by
using high visibility safety fencing that is placed
at least 3 m (10 ft) to the northeast of the existing cemetery fence. The safety fencing should
extend the length of the existing cemetery boundary plus an additional 20 m (65.6 ft) beyond each
marked corner. Second, it is recommended that
Gulf Crossing have a monitor present during construction of the pipeline within this area to ensure
that the cemetery is not adversely affected. This
monitor must have the authority to halt construction in the unlikely event that unrecorded human
remains are encountered at the location and the
Unanticipated Discovery Plan needs to be enacted.
A single historic structure lies within the current route of the Gulf Crossing Pipeline project
in Cass County. Designated Structure G032307B01, it is a still-occupied residence that was built in
1922 according to a local informant. An architectural assessment of the structure indicates that the
building is not eligible for listing on the National
Register as it has lost its historic integrity through
recent additions and alterations. However, given

that it is an occupied structure, avoidance of this
building during construction is recommended.
All 14 of the isolated find spots that were
recorded within the preferred corridor, along with
nine cultural resources now located outside the
project area, have been assessed as not meeting
the required level of significance for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places (see Table
8.2). Further investigations at these cultural resources are not recommended . These 23 cultural
resources are generally characterized by historic
structures that do not retain several of the required
elements of integrity, or artifact scatters with low
artifact counts, limited or absent subsurface cultural deposits, and/or a lack of stratigraphic integrity within the assessed survey corridor.
Five cultural resources that now lie outside
of the project’s Area of Potential Effects were
not assessed for their National Register of Historic Places eligibility (Table 8.2)l. These cultural resources are Structure F032507a-01 and
Isolated Finds G032207a-01 and G032207b-01
in Franklin County, Structure C031407a-01 in
Cass County, Site 41CS137 in Cass County, and
cemetery LR-C049 in Lamar County. Structures
F032507a-01 in Franklin County and C031407a01 in Cass County consist of historic standing
structures that were observed outside the 91.5 m
(300 ft) wide environmental survey corridor used
for the Phase I survey. They therefore both lie
outside of the Gulf Crossing Project area and will
not be impacted during pipeline construction. As
landowner permission to allow a close examination of the structures was not granted, an accurate
evaluation of their National Register of Historic
Places significance could not be made. Additional
Phase I architectural recordation of these structures is recommended if future undertakings are
planned in the vicinity of these resources.
Isolated Finds G032207a-01 and G032207b01 also were located outside of the permitted environmental survey corridor for the current Phase
I study. They each consisted of a single prehistoric lithic artifact that were observed within ground
exposures in an area adjacent to the existing
cleared pipeline right-of-way in Franklin County.
As landowner approval had not been granted for
an examination of these areas, the artifacts were
not collected; however, GPS positions of the lo195

cations were taken using a Trimble. Their position has been plotted on USGS topographic maps
that are being provided under separate cover to
the Texas Historic Commission and the FERC.

Phase I archeological survey of these locations is
recommended if future undertakings are planned
for the area.

GEOARCHEOLOGICAL RESULTS

GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE OF THE PROPOSED
GULF CROSSING PIPELINE PROJECT AREA IN TEXAS
Rolfe D. Mandel, Ph.D.
Kansas Geological Survey

INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of the geoarchaeological reconnaissance of the proposed
Gulf Crossing Pipeline in the State of Texas. Gulf Crossing, LLC proposes to construct
an approximately 335-mile-long,42-inch- outside diameter natural gas liquids (NGL)
pipeline between Sherman, Texas and Delhi, Louisiana. Within Texas, the proposed
pipeline route is 137 miles long and extends from Grayson and Fannin Counties. The
route proceeds northeastward from Sherman, Texas across the Red River to Bennington,
Oklahoma before heading southeastward back across the Red River and into Texas. In
addition to Grayson and Fannin Counties, the route traverses portions of Lamar, Red
River, Franklin, Titus, Morris, and Cass counties (Figure 1). This route crosses three
major streams: the Red River, the Bois D'Arc River, and the Sulfur River. In addition, it
crosses 19 creeks (see Table 1).
Prior to the mid-1980s, most archeologists working in Texas and other areas of the
Southern Osage Plains relied on traditional methods of surface surveys to locate
prehistoric cultural deposits in stream valleys (Ferring 2000). These methods, such as
pedestrian surveys and shallow shovel testing, rarely detect buried cultural materials.
Bettis and Littke (1987:3) pointed out that inadequate subsurface sampling in stream
valleys has led to significant gaps in the record of known prehistoric cultural resources,
as well as erroneous conclusions about some aspects of regional cultural history. A
number of studies (e.g, Artz 1985; Mandel et al. 1991; Mandel 1992a, 1992b, 1994a,
1994b, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2006) demonstrated that stream valleys have
extensive surfaces that are geologically quite young, often post-dating 2000 B.P., and that
most of the existing record of prehistoric cultures is deeply buried. They emphasized the
need for deep subsurface testing and understanding the age and distribution of the
deposits composing the landforms in order to adequately evaluate the landscape for
cultural resources.
The primary objective of the geoarchaeological investigation of the Gulf Crossing
Pipeline project area was to identify localities that warrant deep subsurface testing. The
identification of these localities was based on a visual reconnaissance of the project area;
no subsurface exploration was conducted. The reconnaissance involved assessing
geomorphic settings, with emphasis on identifying Holocene and late Pleistocene
landform sediment assemblages, such as alluvial terraces and fans, that have high
potential for buried cultural deposits. Localities with such potential will be bypassed by
rerouting the proposed pipeline or targeted for deep subsurface testing. The specific
methods used in the geoarchaeological survey are described below.

1

METHODS
The geoarchaeological investigation began with an inspection of U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute
topographic maps showing the route of the proposed Gulf Crossing Pipeline. Segments of
the proposed route that traverse stream valleys with late Quaternary (Holocene and
terminal Pleistocene) terraces and/or alluvial fans were identified as localities with
potential for buried cultural deposits. All V-shaped valleys where significant sediment
storage probably has not occurred were eliminated in this process.
The next stage of the geoarchaeological investigation involved reconnaissance of stream
crossings remaining on the list after the inspection of the topographic maps (see Table 1).
Janice McLean, Project Manager, participated in this component of the investigation.
Each locality was visited in order to assess the landscape. At some bridge crossings,
natural exposures in stream banks provided opportunities to examine sedimentary
deposits. However, the reconnaissance of the proposed pipeline route was limited to a
windshield survey from public roads.
RESULTS OF THE GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE
Based on information gleaned from the geoarchaeological reconnaissance, 17 localities
were excluded from Phase I geoarchaeological testing (Table 2). Most of these localities
were eliminated because they are poorly drained. For example, wetlands were observed
along most of the proposed pipeline route that crosses the valley floor of White Oak
Creek (Figure 2). In the Sulfur River valley and many other localities, clay-rich hydric
soils span the valley floor (Figure 3). Wetlands and hydric soils occur due to a
combination of geologic and climatic conditions. Flat topography on floodplains
underlain by clay-rich alluvium minimizes runoff and infiltration, favoring the
development of broad areas of wet soils in moist-subhumid climatic zones such as
northeastern Texas. Although prehistoric people may have visited wetlands for hunting
and gathering, it is unlikely that they spent much time in such poorly drained settings.
Ephemeral camps associated with hunting and gathering activities rarely yield a rich
material record, and most of the archaeological sites are probably on the higher
geomorphic surfaces in the valley landscape.
Two localities – Bois D’Arc River valley and Mallory Creek valley – were excluded from
Phase I geoarchaeological testing because the valley fill is stratified nearly to the land
surface, and no buried soils were detected in cutbank exposures along the streams
(Figures 4 and 5). Based on these observations, the valley floors of both streams were
unstable and experienced rapid sedimentation. Hence, they were unfavorable for
prehistoric human occupation, especially compared to the adjacent uplands, and are
unlikely to yield buried cultural deposits.
Two localities – Choctaw Creek and the Red River – were identified as areas that require
subsurface exploration in order to assess the geologic potential for buried cultural
deposits (Table 3). These localities are described below.

2

Choctaw Creek
The Choctaw Creek Locality (Milepost 4.90 to 5.35) in Grayson and Fanning counties
spans a broad alluvial terrace of the Red River (Figure 6). Based on its position in the
valley landscape, the terrace probably is underlain by Holocene valley fill. Coring is
needed to determine whether buried Holocene and/or terminal Pleistocene soils are
present in the portion of the terrace fill that will be impacted by emplacement of the
proposed pipeline.
A minimum of two (2) cores is recommended for the Choctaw Creek Locality. However,
additional cores may be taken based observations during the coring. For example, it may
be necessary to trace potential cultural deposits (i.e., charcoal, burned earth, bone, etc.) or
a buried soil observed in one or more of the two cores.
Red River
The Red River Locality (Milepost 43.46-46.70) in Fannin County spans at least five
alluvial terraces comprising the valley floor (Figures 7, 8, and 9). Based on their position
in the valley landscape, most if not all of the terraces are underlain by Holocene valley
fill. Coring is needed to determine (1) the relative ages of the terrace fills, and (2)
whether buried Holocene and/or terminal Pleistocene soils are present in terrace fills that
will be impacted by emplacement of the proposed pipeline.
A minimum of five (5) cores is recommended for the Red River Locality. However,
additional cores may be taken based observations during the coring. For example, it may
be necessary to trace potential cultural deposits (i.e., charcoal, burned earth, bone, etc.) or
a buried soil observed in one or more of the two cores.

RECOMMENDED DEEP TESTING PROCEDURES
Coring with a Giddings hydraulic soil probe has proven to be an efficient and costeffective method for deep geoarchaeological testing without causing significant land
disturbance (e.g., Mandel 1993, 1997, 1999). This method is recommended for deep
testing in the Gulf Crossing Pipeline project area and is described below.
A four-wheel drive pickup truck will be used to transport the Giddings probe to the
coring localities. The probe is mounted on a small, single-axle trailer (Figure 10). At each
coring site, the back end of the trailer will be anchored to the ground. This requires
emplacement of two anchors with the rotating head of the soil probe. A 52 inch-long
barrel will be used to collect 2.5 inch-diameter cores to the depth of impact of the
proposed pipeline (Figure 11). The cores will be briefly described in the field before they
are wrapped in plastic and aluminum foil and placed in core boxes for transport to the
Kansas Geological Survey (KGS). The core holes will be completely filled with bentonite
prior to departure from the coring site.

3

At the KGS, the cores will be described using standard procedures and terminology
outlined by Soil Survey Staff (1993) and Birkeland (1999). Also, the cores will be
carefully inspected for potential cultural deposits, such as charcoal, burned earth, and
bone. If charcoal and/or bone are found in the cores, these materials will be collected for
AMS radiocarbon dating. In addition, bulk soil samples may be collected from buried
soils for radiocarbon dating.
If potential or actual cultural materials and/or Holocene-age buried soils are found in a
core, deep archaeological testing will be recommended for that coring locality.
Otherwise, no further action will be required.
