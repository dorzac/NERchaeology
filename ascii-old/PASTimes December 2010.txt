Updating Calf Creek
Dr. Don G. Wyckoff
Since 1995, when 2 volumes of Oklahoma data on the Calf Creek
Complex were published, archaeologists in Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma and Texas have continued to compile information on the
occurrences, ages, and environmental contexts associated with this
distinctive Middle Holocene hunter-gatherer adaptation. The
presentation to the Panhandle Archaeological Society will attempt to
summarize much of the new information and relate it to growing
evidence for a brief interlude of climatic amelioration on the
Southern Plains between 5500 and 4900 years ago.
Biography
On July 1, 1996, Dr. Don G. Wyckoff was hired as Associate
Curator of Archaeology for the Oklahoma Museum of Natural
History. He also holds the position of Associate Professor with the
Department of Anthropology, University of Oklahoma. Dr. Wyckoff
has a long career association with archaeological studies in
Oklahoma, including obtaining his B.A. and M.A. degrees in
anthropology at OU, serving as staff archaeologist for the Oklahoma
River Basin Survey Project from 1962 to 1968, and as State
Archeologist and Director of the Oklahoma Archeological Survey
from 1968 to 1996. During these years he conducted excavations at
over 50 prehistoric sites in various parts of the state with special
interests in the Caddoan archaeological tradition in both the
Arkansas and Red river basins of eastern Oklahoma, and ancient
hunter-gatherer camps in eastern Oklahoma. He received his Ph.D.
in 1980 from Washington State University where he specialized in
the Quaternary Studies Program. Since 1985 he has used that
knowledge to develop research on early Holocene-late Pleistocene
archaeological, paleontological, and geological sites eastern and
northwestern Oklahoma. His research findings are published in such
journals as Geoarchaeology, Current Research in the Pleistocene,
Southeastern Archaeology, Journal of American Archaeology, Plains
Anthropologist, and the Bulletin of the Oklahoma Anthropological
Society. He has long advocated positive working relationships with
avocational archaeologists and served many years as Bulletin Editor
of the Oklahoma Anthropological Society.

From Bascom to the Walls:
Kit Carson's 1864 Adobe Walls Campaign
On November 12, 1864, Colonel Kit Carson left Fort Bascom, New Mexico, with 335 soldiers and
seventy-five Ute and Jicarilla Apache scouts. They marched down the north side of the Canadian River
toward Adobe Walls-Bent's old trading post.
Early on the morning of November 25, the taunting calls of Indians reached them from across the
Canadian River, "Come over here." Carson's cavalry obliged as they laid chase down river, through the
Indian village, and on to Adobe Walls. Carson and a few troopers followed with two howitzers, which
saved their skins.
At the first firing of the howitzers, the Indians fled down river but soon returned with several hundred
additional Indians. By mid-afternoon, with ammunition running low and having separated from the supply
wagons the day before, the situation was bleak. Carson thought it prudent to move back up river, burn the
Kiowa village, and locate his supplies.
After setting the village afire, the troops marched west for about four miles and located their wagons on a
protected ridge. After a day's recuperation, the column marched back toward New Mexico arriving at Fort
Bascom on December 10.
Many authors have written about Carson as mountain man, adventurer with Fremont, soldier in the
Mexican War, government liaison at Indian peace councils, and leader in the Navajo and Apache
campaigns, but history books contain almost nothing on Carson's battle at Adobe Walls.
Alvin Lynn has filled that void. Beginning his research in the 1990s, he located and walked the 200-milelong wagon road from Fort Bascom to Adobe Walls and collected 1800 metal artifacts from 15 historic
camps including the burned Kiowa village. Alvin has written an account of this forgotten phase of Kit
Carson's adventures, soon to be published by Texas Tech University Press.

The Edward Bray Artifact Collection
In October 2010 Courson Archaeological Research was loaned the Edward Bray Collection for analysis and
documentation. The collection consists of 60 chipped stone projectile points or bifaces, a cache containing 79 items,
five metal arrowpoints likely dating to the post-1800 period, and four modern replica projectile points. These
artifacts were collected by Edward Bray from several ranches in northeastern New Mexico.
Diagnostic artifacts contained in the collection are dominated by Late Archaic and Early Ceramic period cornernotched dart (N=21) and arrowpoints (N=12) and Middle or Late Ceramic period Washita and Harrell arrowpoints
(N=16). Four triangular arrowpoints are characterized by multiple side notches and are generally referred to as
Huffaker points. A heavily reworked Harahey knife made of Alibates silicified dolomite is also represented. The
oldest artifact in the collection is a single Paleoindian projectile point, a reworked Allen point made of Tesesquite
quartzite. The remaining five chipped stone artifacts include four side-notched or unnotched projectile points likely
dating to the Middle Archaic period and a dart point preform. Raw materials represented in the collection include
Alibates (N=113), quartzite (N=13), obsidian (N=3), basalt (N=3), metal (N=5), and other identified materials
(N=11).
A cache of 79 artifacts found on a ranch near Folsom, New Mexico is
also contained in the collection. This assemblage of artifacts consists
entirely of flakes, except for one triangular biface produced from a flake.
All of the items in the cache are produced from Alibates, except for one
Tesesquite quartzite flake. Two-thirds of the cache represent flat, thinning
flakes produced by soft hammer reduction and the remaining one-third are
curved blades also produced by soft hammer reduction. The latter appear
to represent distal scraper preforms. No diagnostics are present and no
refits were identified. The total weight of the cache is 2203.7 g. The
average size of the artifacts contained in the cache is as follows: Length
58.6 mm, Width 37.6 mm, Thickness 10.7 mm, and Weight 27.9 g.

As noted above, five metal arrowpoints are represented in
the collection (see Table 1). These items are characterized
by long slender blades, rounded to angular shoulders, and
narrow parallel stems with serrated margins. The
thickness of each of these projectiles varies considerably
from the distal to proximal ends suggesting that they may
have been produced from some stock other than barrel or
keg strapping.

Four items in the collection appear to represent modern replicas. Three of these items are Folsom replicas likely
produced by Marvin McCormick (see http://www.ele.net/mccormick/mccormick.htm). These items lack basal
grinding and are unusually thick for true Folsom points (see Table 2). The remaining replica is an Eden-like point
produced from obsidian. This item also lacks basal grinding.

In all, the Edward Bray collection contains a good representative sample of projectile points typical for the
region during the late Holocene. The Bray cache provides a great deal of insight into caching behavior along
the northwestern boundary of the Southern High Plains. The collection is unusual in that it contains several
metal arrowpoints, an artifact type that is rarely found in most local collections. Lastly, the presence of
replica Folsom points, probably made Marvin McCormick, further documents the excellent craftsmanship of
this early flintknapper. The author wishes to thank the Edward Bray Family for their permission to document
this valuable collection.
