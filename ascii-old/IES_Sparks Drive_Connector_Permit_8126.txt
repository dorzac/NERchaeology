ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES)
for the Sparks Drive Connector Project, City of Cleburne, Johnson County, Texas. Per
the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, as the project will transpire on land
owned or controlled by the City of Cleburne, which is a political subdivision of the State
of Texas, the proposed project will require coordination with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) prior to construction. In addition, as the project will require a
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) permit from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), portions of the project within USACE jurisdiction will also be
subject to the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. All work conformed to 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800, and
13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations for implementing
Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources that could
be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for
their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologist Thomas Chapman on
03 August 2017, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8126. During the IES survey, no
cultural resources were encountered within the 19.1-acre Area of Potential Effects.
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All records will be temporarily curated
at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL). No further work is warranted. However, if any
archeological sites are encountered during construction, the operators should stop
construction activities, and immediately contact the project environment representative to
initiate coordination with the THC prior to resuming any construction activities.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002). This report presents a brief description of the project area or Area of
Potential Effects (APE), environmental setting, relevant cultural background, and methodology; followed
by the results of the investigations and recommendations. This report serves as the cultural resources
report to satisfy the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).

1.1: Introduction
Project Description
This scope of work has been developed by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES), which has
been contracted by Childress Engineers, on behalf of the City of Cleburne, to perform an intensive
cultural resources survey in advance of the proposed Sparks Drive connector located north of the
intersection of Weatherford Highway (State Highway [SH] 171) and Chisholm Trail Parkway in the City
of Cleburne, Johnson County, Texas. The APE is plotted on recent aerial photographs and the Joshua 7.5
Minute Series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangle sheet (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
Project History
On 12 May 2017, IES provided a desktop analysis to the Texas Historical Commission (THC) for the
Sparks Drive Connector Project. Through the desktop analysis, we identified that the limits of one
previously conducted archeological survey encompassed the vast majority of the proposed Sparks Drive
Connector project. The survey was conducted for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil
Conservation Service (SCS) in 1982 for West Fork Buffalo Creek Watershed Plan. For that reason, we
recommended that the proposed project be allowed to proceed without additional cultural investigations.
After the submittal of the desktop analysis to the THC, IES obtained the USDA SCS watershed plan
report and conducted coordination with the THC regarding this past survey. Through additional research
and coordination it was determined that the previously conducted survey did not likely cover the Sparks
Drive Connector APE, nor likely met present day archeological survey standards. In addition, IES
conducted a site visit with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Fort Worth District (USACE) to review
impacts to waters of the United States and to discuss the project with the USACE Regulatory
Archeologists. Through consultation with the USACE Regulatory Archeologist, it was determined that
the USACE would likely require a cultural resources survey to maintain compliance with Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and to authorize the needed Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act (CWA) Nationwide Permit (NWP). On 06 June 2017, the THC provided concurrence to the
provided desktop analysis stating that no historic properties will be affected by the proposed project.
However, on 13 June 2017, the USACE provided confirmation that the agency would still require a
cultural resources survey to complete their Section 106 review of the proposed project. Since the project
is sponsored by the City of Cleburne and would be subject to the ACT, an Antiquities Permit must be
obtained prior to conduct the requested survey.
Regulatory Framework
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
As the project will require a Section 404 of the CWA permit from the USACE, the project would be
subject to the provisions of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. The NHPA (54 U.S. Code [USC] 300101),
specifically Section 106 of the NHPA (54 USC 306108) requires the State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO), an official appointed in each State or territory, to administer and coordinate historic preservation
activities, and to review and comment on all actions licensed by the Federal government that will have an
effect on properties listed in the National Register of Historic Place (NRHP), or eligible for such listing.

Per 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800, the Federal agency responsible for overseeing the
action must make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural resources.
Antiquities Code of Texas
As the project will transpire on land owned or controlled by the City of Cleburne, which is a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, the proposed project will be subjected to the provisions of the ACT.
The ACT was passed in 1969 and requires that the SHPO, represented by the THC, staff review an action
that has the potential to disturb historic and archeological sites on public land. Actions that require review
under the ACT include any project that will have ground disturbing activities on land owned or controlled
by a political subdivision of the site and include easements on private property. However, if the activity
occurs inside a designated historic district, affects a recorded archeological site, or requires onsite
investigations the project will need to be reviewed by the THC regardless of project size.
Identification, evaluation, and documentation of archeological sites shall be completed in accordance with
the provisions of the Secretary of the Interiorâs Standards. Archeological investigations shall be
performed and documented at sufficient levels to satisfy the THC requirements for determining the
presence of archeologically significant properties within the APE in accordance with 13 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outlines the regulations for implementing the ACT. The goal of
the survey will be to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources that could be adversely affected by
proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for their potential eligibility for listing as a State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility for listing in the NRHP.

1.2: Area of Potential Effects
Direct APE
The APE encompasses approximately 19.1 acres. Current plans call for the construction of an undivided,
two-lane road that crosses West Buffalo Creek and connects Sparks Drive and Sparks Road. The
proposed connector road will measure approximately 2,037 feet (0.38 mile) in length and will require an
80-foot wide maintained right-of-way (ROW). The road will be elevated approximately 13 feet above the
existing floodplain grade and will require an approximate 210-foot long bridge to span West Buffalo
Creek. The fill for the bridge abutments will be graded in a 4:1 slope. Grading associated with the bridge
construction will extend between approximately 41 and 61 feet from the proposed paved surface.
The deepest subsurface impacts associated with the proposed project include support columns situated in
drilled shafts on either side of the creek that extend to bedrock in addition to rock rip-rap near each end of
the bridge. The proposed Sparks Drive connector road also includes a system of stormwater drains.
While the exact depth of subsurface impacts is unknown, investigations were conducted to the depth of
construction or culturally sterile deposits.
Indirect APE
As the project will require Federal permitting from the USACE, an assessment of the indirect effects will
be required within USACE jurisdiction to satisfy Section 106 requirements. The highest vertical elements
associated with the project will be the bridge needed to span West Buffalo Creek. To account for these
potential above ground elements, a 300-foot wide indirect effects APE will be considered surrounding the
direct APE within USACE jurisdictional areas.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1: Environmental Setting
Climate
Johnson County lies in the north-central part of the state of Texas. Annual rainfall precipitation is
approximately 32.27 inches. Approximately 60 percent of the rainfall occurs between April and
September. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year-round temperature with the
occasional exceedingly hot and cold periods. Thunderstorms occur approximately 50 days of the year and
mostly occurring in spring (Estaville and Earl 2008).
Topographic Setting
The USGS Joshua 7.5â Quadrangle map illustrates that the APE is located within a gently rolling
topographic setting that is sporadically dissected by named creeks and unnamed tributaries (see
Figure 1.2). West Buffalo Creek is the primary topographic feature within the APE and bisects the APE
into roughly equal halves. A narrow floodplain surrounds West Buffalo Creek and gives way to gently
rising topography. A single unnamed tributary is located on the west side of West Buffalo Creek, which
originates approximately 210 feet north of the APE. West Buffalo Creek flows in a general north to south
orientation across the APE and confluences with the Nolan River approximately nine miles south of the
APE. Downstream of the APE, West Buffalo Creek was impounded by the USDA SCS to create Lake
George Marti (also known as Marti Reservoir). At full capacity, the upper reaches of this lake would
extend north of the APE.
Geology and Soils
The APE is located within an environmental interface or ecotone, between the Eastern Cross Timbers and
Grand Prairie ecoregions. The Eastern Cross Timbers ecoregion is located between the Blackland
Prairies to the east and the Grand Prairie to the west. The ecoregion occurs on a narrow band of Upper
Cretaceous sandstone, the Woodbine Formation that supports oak dominated woodlands. The Grand
Prairie is a limestone-rich ecoregion located between the Eastern Cross Timbers and the Western Cross
Timbers. This transitional region between moist and dry climates typically contains rolling plains with
meandering streams. Before extensive settlement, the Grand Prairie was characterized by open plains
dominated by tall and short grasses. Forested areas were limited to draws and drainages along stream
banks and river valleys. Although a significant portion of the Grand Prairie has been converted to
cropland or improved pasture, the region supports some of the largest areas of native grass in Texas.
Soils within this region mostly consist of shallow, well drained, dark clay deposits (Griffith et al. 2007;
Texas A&M Forest Service 2017). Soils in this area are underlain by Grayson Marl and Main Street
Limestone, undivided (Kgm), which is comprised of gray marl and limestone dating to the Cretaceous
(Figure 2.1) (McGowen et al. 1987; USGS 2017).
As shown by the Soil Survey of Johnson County, Texas, there are five mapped soils within the APE
(Table 2.1) (Coburn 1985). Approximately 82.3 percent of the APE contains upland soils typical of the
Eastern Cross Timbers and Grand Prairie ecoregions. The remaining 17.7 percent of the APE contains
occasionally flooded soils near West Buffalo Creek. Soil data was viewed from the USDA Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Figure 2.2) (Web Soil Survey 2017).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1: Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) maintained by the THC identified that
there are no previously recorded archeological sites, National Register Historic Properties, historical
markers, or cemeteries located within the APE or within one mile (~1,600 meter [m]) of the APE
(TASA 2017). According to TASA records, one survey was previously conducted within the APE by the
USDA SCS in 1981. The TASA indicates the survey encompassed the vast majority of the APE.
However, based on agency coordination and conducted research, it was determined that this survey likely
did not adequately assess the current APE or meet todayâs survey standards. In addition, there are three
previously conducted cultural surveys located within one mile of the APE (Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1).

3.2: Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Johnson County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Dallas Sheet), the USGS topographic map, the
NRCS digital soil database for Johnson County, the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for
Johnson County, the National Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census
Enumeration District Maps for Johnson County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps,
and both past and current aerial photography.
Prehistoric Resource Potential
Data presented within the PALM for Johnson County indicated the vast majority of the APE featured a
moderate potential for containing shallow and deeply buried cultural materials within a reasonable
context. A high potential for shallow and deeply buried deposits was located along West Buffalo Creek.
The eastern terminus of the APE featured a low potential for containing shallow and deeply buried
cultural deposits.
In addition, through the site visit by IES and the USACE Regulatory Archeologist, it was determined that
there was low potential for deeply buried archeological deposits. As such, it was not anticipated that
backhoe trenching would be required for this project. However, if potential for these deposits was
observed during the survey, IES would conduct the necessary field investigations to assess for deeply
buried deposits.

Past disturbances within the APE were observed within historical aerial photography. Historical aerial
photography illustrates the APE was utilized as an agricultural field or pasture as early as 1953. In 1987,
the USDA SCS impounded Buffalo Creek approximately 0.84 mile south of the APE. Between 2001 and
2005, development began surrounding the APE with construction of the eastern segment of Sparks Drive,
industrial complexes, and oil/gas pad sites. Near the eastern terminus, a gas pipeline and sanitary sewer
pipeline were installed in a north/south orientation across the APE. Although modern development has
changed the landscape east and west of the APE, aerial photographs indicate that much of the APE near
Buffalo Creek has been largely undisturbed as early as 1953. As such, the majority of the APE contains a
reasonable context and features a moderate to high potential for containing prehistoric cultural materials.
Historic-Period Resource Potential
Historic-period resources within North-Central Texas are primarily related to farmsteads, houses, and
associated outbuildings and structures that date from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Typically,
these types of resources are located along old roadways, but can be located along railroads, creeks, and
open pastures. Although determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings and structures were
problematic, thorough and accurate maps depicting these features were widely available post-1918.
Historical maps indicate the APE was void of historic-period buildings and structures as early as 1894.
This was visually confirmed through historical aerial photography from 1953 and modern aerial
photograph interpretations. As such, the APE has a low potential for historic-period archeological and
architectural resources.

METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for the cultural resources survey of the Sparks Drive Connector project was
conducted on 03 August 2017. The methods and density of excavating shovel tests met the minimum
requirements for field operations stipulated by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for
Texas. Prior to field work, the IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records search to
determine what cultural resources have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile radius of the
APE. This information was detailed in Chapter 3. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological,
geological, soils data, as well as, historical and recent topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1: Survey Methods
The 100-percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The transect survey
was comprised of a multiple transect scheme, which was implemented across the APE. Transects were
spaced at 30 m intervals and orientated in a manner that provided the best coverage. Areas displaying
high levels of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of potential for intact archeological
deposits. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.

4.2: Shovel Testing
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to 60 centimeters (cm) or
the bottom of culturally sterile deposits, whichever was encountered first. Each shovel test measured
approximately 30 cm in diameter and was hand-excavated in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding
20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch hardware cloth to test for the presence of
buried cultural materials. All test units were recorded on maps and plotted using handheld global
positioning system (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of each shovel test on standardized
shovel test forms. According to the Archeological Survey Standards of Texas, for projects displaying
little to no disturbance, an APE between 11 and 100 acres required one shovel test per two acres. As
such, an APE of 19.1 acres required 10 shovel tests. However, the quantity of shovel tests varied based
on the amount of ground disturbance, exposed bedrock or culturally sterile soil, ground visibility, steep
slopes present within the APE, or if archeological site(s) are encountered. All positive shovel tests,
cultural features, and other site data was geospatially recorded using a Trimble Geo XT handheld GPS
unit.

4.3: Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation were included in the curation package. All field-generated documents were temporarily
curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and photographs were
organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

RESULTS
During the pedestrian survey, no cultural resources were encountered within the 19.1-acre APE. Shovel
test locations are illustrated in Figure 5.1. A photograph location map and photographs are located in
Appendix A.

5.1: Archeological Survey
Survey Observations
During background review, it was determined that ground-disturbing activities related to past land use,
transportation development, and utility development have transpired within the APE. Historical aerial
photography depicted the majority of the APE was used as an agricultural field or pasture field as early as
1953. Recent development saw the expansion of Sparks Drive and the installation of a gas pipeline and
sanitary sewer pipeline as early as 2005. Although modern development has changed the landscape east
and west of the APE, aerial photographs indicated that much of the APE near West Buffalo Creek has
been largely undisturbed as early as 1953.
During the survey, field investigations verified that the past land use and development within and
surrounding the APE have disturbed portions of the APE. The APE was located within a varied
environment that ranged from agricultural fields to a thinly wooded corridor situated along West Buffalo
Creek. The topography within the APE was primarily very gently sloping and the western and eastern
extent of the APE exhibited clear signs of modification from past transportation development.
Overall, approximately 30 percent of the APE was located within areas that are routinely mowed or
plowed. The western 615 feet of the APE incorporated portions of two agricultural fields, an overgrown
unpaved roadway, utility lines, and infrastructure associated with Sparks Road and Chisholm Trail
Parkway (Appendix A, Photographs 1 and 2). An additional dry drainage feature was observed north of
the unpaved road. The central approximate 0.3-mile portion of the APE was centered along West Buffalo
Creek. This portion of the APE featured thin woody vegetation intermixed with tall grasses that abutted
the creek (Appendix A, Photographs 3 through 6). Minimal ground disturbances observed within this
portion of the APE pertained to the 75-foot wide maintained easement serving the gas and sanitary sewer
pipelines and connector site constructed prior to 2005 (Appendix A, Photographs 7 and 8). The eastern
260 feet of the APE was comprised of Sparks Drive, unnamed roadways serving surrounding businesses,
a utility line, and maintained right-of-way (ROW) and utility easement (Appendix A, Photographs 9 and
10).
Although vegetation was thick along the banks of West Buffalo Creek (Appendix B, Photograph 4),
several cutbank exposures were assessed during the survey for evidence of buried cultural deposits and to
gauge the potential that cultural deposits could be deeply buried (Appendix B, Photograph 11). On
average, the cutbanks along West Buffalo Creek rose approximately 3 to 4 feet above the active channel.
No cultural deposits were observed within the West Buffalo Creek cutbank exposures, nor were any
deeply buried soils. For these reasons, it was determined that backhoe trenching would not be required to
assess for deeply buried cultural deposits.
Shovel Testing
During the pedestrian survey, 10 negative shovel tests were excavated throughout the APE (see Figure
5.1). Shovel Test TC1 was located within the lower potential extents of the APE and encountered a very
dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam with frequent gravel less than 0.5 cm in size. This overlaid a
very dark brown (10YR 2/2) clay loam with no inclusions. The large occurrence of gravel was likely a
result of runoff from the nearby overgrown unpaved roadway approximately 30 m to the south. The
remaining nine shovel tests were situated within the undisturbed central portion of the APE. These shovel
tests revealed clay loam that ranged from brown (10YR 4/2) along the margins of the central portion to
very dark brown (10YR 2/2) near West Buffalo Creek. Shovel tests were terminated between 40 and 60

cmbs due to observed disturbances and the presence of culturally sterile soil. Additionally, subsurface
exposures including animal burrows, disturbed patches, and the banks of West Buffalo Creek were
examined.

5.2: Indirect APE Assessment
To satisfy NHPA requirements, visual impacts were assessed. Historical maps and modern aerial
photographs indicated the indirect APE was void of historic-period resources. The indirect effects survey
verified the indirect APE was comprised of agricultural or open land and did not contain any historicperiod, non-archeological cultural resources.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey, 10 negative shovel tests were excavated within the 19.1-acre APE.
Although the background review identified that portions of the APE contained a moderate to high
potential for cultural resources, no cultural resources were encountered during the intensive pedestrian
survey.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the Sparks Drive Connector Project be permitted to
continue without the need for further cultural resource investigations. However, if any archeological
resources are encountered during construction, the operators should stop construction activities
immediately in those areas. The project environmental consultant should then be contacted to initiate
further consultation with the THC/SHPO prior to resuming construction activities.
