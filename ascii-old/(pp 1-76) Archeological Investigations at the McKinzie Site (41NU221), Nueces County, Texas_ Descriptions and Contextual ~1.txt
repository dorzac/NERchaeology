Archeological Investigations at the McKinzie Site
(41NU221), Nueces County, Texas: Description and
Contextual Interpretations
Robert A. Ricklis
ABSTRACT
This paper decribes excavations and findings at the McKinzie site near
Corpus Christi, Texas. Two discrete components were identified; the earlier
Archaic component, recognized as a thin shell midden containing a profusion of
shells of the brackish water clam Rangiaflexuosa, is dated to about 5000 B. P. and
is inferred to represent an estuarine bayshore adaption at that time. The later
component, assigned to the Late Prehistoric Rockport complex, produced evidence for a seasonal, mulfifunctional, and residential occupation during which
small groups carried out various subsistence activities, apparently in circular huts
that had central hearth complexes and, possibly, small storage pits. A model of
seasonally oscillating settlement and subsistence patterns is developed for the Late
Prehistoric stage in the area, providing an ecological context for the Rockport
complex component.

INTRODUCTION
The McKinzie site (41NU221) is a multicomponent site on the dissected
Pleistocene river terrace that overlooks the modern floodplain of the lower Nueces
River near Corpus Christi, Texas ~igure 1). Excavations were carded out at the site
during 1984 and 1985; this paper describes the results of that work and offers
interpretations relevant to questions of prehistoric chronology and cultural adaptations for the Texas Coastal Bend area.
Investigations at the McKinzie site revealed two discrete prehistoric components. The earlier and stratigraphically lower component is from a fairly early
period in the long-lived Archaic stage of the region. Data for the Archaic component
are limited, but an approximate chronological placement of this component can be
made. Additionally, certain inferences can be drawn regarding seasonality of
occupation and subsistence activities for both components. The later component is
assigned, on the basis of diagnostic ceramic and lithic artifacts, to the Rockport
complex, a Late Prehistoric adaptation to the central Texas coast involving a
hunting-fishing-gathering subsistence base (see Suhm et al. 1954, Campbell 1958c).
The Rockport complex was the more extensively investigated of the two components. The spatial relationships among various features and the distributions of
cultural debris are inferred to represent a culturally significant pattern, which,
coupled with information on seasonality and length of occupation, sheds light on the
nature of a single seasonal occupational episode assignable to the Rockport
complex.

Data from previous limited surveys and test excavations in Nueces and San
Patricio counties, suggest too that Rock~ort complex sites, as defined by fairly
consistent artifact assemblages containing Rockport ware pottery (see Suhm and
Jelks 1962:131-135), Perdiz and Fresno arrowpoints (ibid., Turner and Hester
1985) and small end scrapers, do not have ecological homogeneity as reflected in
(a) spatial and microenvironmental locations, (b) the predominant faunal remains,
or (c) the apparent intensity of occupation. This ecological heterogeneity will form
the inferential basis for a preliminary model of settlement and subsistence patterns
for the Late Prehistoric occupation of the Corpus Christi Bay/Nueces River area.
The model, which will posit a pattern of seasonal oscillation between large fallwinter camps of aggregate groups and smaller dispersed spring-summer encampments, will offer a cultural ecological context for the Late Prehistoric occupation at
McKinzie. The model is testable and may serve not only as one basis for additional
systematic research into the nature of aboriginal adaptation in the Coastal Bend area
but also as one step toward an integrated perspective on the prehistory of this part
of the western Gulf Coast.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT
The Texas Coastal Bend, part of the Gulf Coastal Plain ~enneman 1938),
consists geologically of sediments deposited by large Pleistocene river systems
during interglacial periods when sea levels approximated those of the present
(Brown et al. 1976:16). The topography is essentially flat, broken only by stream
channels, embayments, and dune formations. Because the sediments consist
primarily of fine-grained clay, the area today is devoid of any naturally occurring
lithic material larger than small pebbles.
The area is included in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province as defined by Blair
(1950), a region characterized on a large scale by mild winters, hot summers, and
a biotic matrix adapted to a xeric environment, but in which there are small-scale
variations in precipitation, net moisture, and associated biotic communities. There
is a trend toward increasingly xeric conditions from north to south along the central
part of the Gulf coast. The Corpus Christi Bay/Nueces River area is a zone of
transition, where annual rainfall averages about 85 cm (35 inches) to the north and
75 cm (30 inches) or less to the south. Vegetation cover north of this zone is
characterized by savanna grasslands, and south by higher incidence of various
thornbrush species and cacti (Brown et al. 1976; Jones 1983).
The shore of the mainland is characterized by bays, lagoons, and estuaries.
Several kilometers offshore is a long chain of barrier islands--sands deposited by
wave action since the establishment of modern sea level at about 2800 to 2500 B.P.
(Brown et al. 1976) ~igure 2).

In the Corpus Christi Bay/Nueces River area, major geological soil zones and
associated floral assemblages are recognizable. The three barrier islands--St.
Joseph, Mustang, and Padre islands--that separate Corpus Christi Bay from the
Gulf of Mexico are mostly treeless, covered with grassy vegetation, predominantly
spikerush, fimbry, glasswort, and sea purslane (Jones 1983:13,14, 54, 65).
The outermost 5 to 10 km of the mainland is the Ingleside strandplain, a sand
of Pleistocene origin. The characteristic Galveston-Mustang soil here supports
several kinds of oak and sweetbay, and an understory of beautyberry and yaupon.
Directly inland from the strandplain are the Pleistocene clays, the most
extensive geologic formation in the Coastal Bend, on which are developed extensive blackland soils. These soils are largely under cultivation, but before the latter
part of the last century the area was grassland savanna. Common floral species were
short grasses such as buffalo grass, the taller bluestem, scattered mesquite, and
prickly pear cactus (Jones 1983).
The extensive and dense stands of mesquite and other thornbrush that abound
in the area apparently are largely modern phenomena. Before the mid-nineteenth
century, savanna conditions predominated (Bogusch 1952, Jones 1983). Apparently the spread and dominance of thornbrush has resulted from both the cessation
of aboriginal burn-offs and the disturbance of the natural groundcover by cattle
grazing.
Before this invasion of thornbrush, trees were confined largely to river valleys
and patchy groves on higher ground within the savanna matrix. River floodplain
moisture supported various species, including ash, elm, box elder, willow, retama,
huisache, and cottonwood. The scattered upland groves included hackberry,
chittimwood, anaqua, live oak, and mesquite (Jones 1983:xvii).
Terrestrial faunal species in the area are those listed by Blair for the Tamaulipan
Biotic Province--61 species of mammals, notably whitetail deer, coyote, javelina,
bobcat, cottontail, jackrabbit, mouse, and rat. Thirty-six species of snake, 19 of
lizard, two of land turtle, three urodeles, and 19 anurans are also noted.
Bison were reported in early historic times along the coastal littoral, though it
is unclear how dense the herds were. Dillehay (1974) has postulated that bison herds
pushed southward into Texas three times during the Holocene,
between 10,000 to 6000 and 5000 B.C.
between 2500 B.C. and A.D. 500, and
between A.D. 1200 and A.D. 1300 to 1500.
No data could be found indicating the presence of bison in southern Texas
before the 1200/1300 episode, but ample evidence has come to light of bison in the
area after about A.D. 1300 in interior southern Texas (Black 1986, Hall et al. 1982,
Hester and Parker 1970, Hester 1977), and this is true to some degree of the same
period on the coast.
Fish abound in the bays and lagoons, notably redfish (red drum), trout, croaker,
gafftop and hardhead catfish, and black drum, which enter the shallower parts of
bays and tidal passes in large numbers to spawn, primarily during the winter months
(Simmons and Breuer 1962).
Shellfish are abundant in the bays from the north shore of Corpus Christi Bay

Ricklis ~ The McKinzie Site

northward. South of Corpus Christi Bay, shellfish decrease in abundance until at
Baffin Bay they are virtually absent, apparently due to the hypersalinity of coastal
waters resulting from the low volume of discharge of fresh water in the more xeric
conditions of deep South Texas (see Hester 1980a).
PALEOENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES
The scale and rapidity of environmental change along coastlines is accentuated
by processes of sea level change, erosion, and sedimentation, which have profound
effects on the localized primary productivity and dependent biotic communities
and, in turn, on the nature of human adaptations. Also, these geologic processes can
affect the quality of the archeological record so severely that sites (especially older
ones) representing important aspects of adaptive systems can be lost to investigation.
One fundamental process is the eustatic sea level rise during the Holocene. The
details of fluctuations in sea level rise have been interpreted differently (cf. Curray
1960, Nelson and Bray 1970, Frazier 1974), but there is general agreement on the
broader patterns in this process. Sea level began to rise rapidly at about 18,000 to
16,000 B.P. and fluctuated several times before about 1800 to 2500 B.P., when it
reached its present level (Brown et al. 1976:21). Between about 10,000 and 7500
B.P. a standstill was maintained, with sea level some 60 to 80 feet lower than at
present. At about 7500 B.P. the sea began to rise rapidly, so that by about 5000 to
4500 B.P. it was about 20 feet below the modem level. Between 5000 to 4500 and
2500 B.P., rise was gradual, with a level approximating modem sea level established by the latter date. With the stabilization of the coastline by the middle of the
third millenium B.P., wave action depositing offshore sediments resulted in the
formation of barrier islands. Except for some tidal passes, Corpus Christi Bay
became separated from the open Gulf, and continuous wave action in the bay
produced the present shoreline (Brown et al. 1976:21).
During the final stage of the Pleistocene, the valley of the lower Nueces River
was eroded into older Pleistocene fluvial deltaic deposits to such an extent that by
the beginning of the Holocene the valley was considerably deeper than at present.
With the rapid sea level rise beginning at 7500 B.P. the valley was innundated and,
about 4500 B.P., the lower Nueces valley was filled with estuarine waters at least
as far inland as a point just west of Calallen (Figure 1) where there are old wavereworked bars and berms (Brown et al. 1976:121). So during this time period a long
bay extended from the open Gulf inland to a point some 35 km west of the present
shoreline.
Unfortunately, there is no direct evidence regarding paleoclimatic change for
this area, and the general lack of good pollen preservation in South Texas
archeological contexts makes reconstruction of prehistoric floral communities and,
inferentially, climatic conditions, difficult at best. Recent research with plant
phytoliths, however, has demonstrated certain certain fluctuations in grass varieties
in the region during the Holocene (Robinson 1979), and such work may offer the
best possibilities for the reconstruction of paleoclimatic change.
Hester (1980b:35) has inferred a savanna parkland environment in South Texas

6

Texas ArcheologiealSociety

for the terminal Pleistocene, and floral and faunal remains recovered from an early
Holocene (about 7000 B.C.) hearth at Baker Cave in the lower Pecos area indicate
an essentially modern biotic assemblage (Hester 1980b: 139-142).
B ased on pollen evidence, Bryant and Holloway (1985) suggest a gradual trend
toward warmer and drier conditions during the Holocene for southwestern and
Central Texas. This generalization for the larger region is the best information
available at present for understanding the basic climatic trend in S outh Texas during
the Holocene.
THE SITE
The McKinzie site is on one of the many hilltops that are remnants of the
dissected Pleistocene terrace of the Nueces River and extend along the southern
edge of the present floodplain, from the head of Nueces Bay to near the west
boundary of Nueces County. The site is some 200 meters south of the present
channel of the Nueces River and 4 km upslream from the head of Nueces Bay. The
location offers a commanding view of the broad floodplain to the north and, under
prehistoric grassland conditions, also would have commanded a good view of the
surrounding uplands in other directions.
Shells of the brackish water clams, Rangia cuneata and Rangiaflexuosa, and
chert debitage are scattered over the entire hilltop, indicating that, at one time or
another, prehistoric human activity extended over every part of the rise.
Much of the site remains intact, but a significant amount of it has been damaged
(Figure 3). The roadcut of an unimproved dirt road crosses (roughly north-south)

the site at its eastern end, and a similar, though presently unused, north-south cut
crosses the approximate center of the site. An area of about 1 hectare (2 acres) of
the southeastern part of the site was severely disturbed by soil removal in February
1984. This activity exposed an extensive spread of Rangia flexuosa clamshell,
which, as will be indicated, was deposited during an Archaic occupation of the site.
According to Robert McKinzie (personal communication), the original
McKinzie family homestead was on the crest of the hilltop, near the easternmost end
of the site, from the nineteenth century to about 1930. Though this homestead is no
longer standing, evidence of its existence survives in the form of various metal,
glass, and ceramic artifacts of the period, especially in the roadcut at the east end of
the site. Though more thinly scattered, such items were noted on the surface near
the excavations, and a few fragments of clear bottle glass, some square and round
nails, and pieces of fence wire were recovered at depths of as much as 10 cm in the
excavations. A circular depression about 1 meter deep and 5 meters in diameter may
be the remains of a cistern said to have been associated with the McKinzie
homestead.
The several disturbances to the site have revealed a soil profile characterized
by an A horizon (roughly 50 cm thick) consisting of a dark brown sandy clay loam
and a tan sandy clay B horizon. This is typical of the Willacy complex, a neutralto-alkaline soil that characterizes the edge of the Pleistocene terrace on which the
site lies (Franki et al. 1960).
The vegetation cover on most of the site, and on the surrounding upland terrace,
is dominated by dense thornbrush of mesquite and hackberry and ground cover of
short grasses. Directly north of the site the floodplain is treeless, except for a narrow
zone along the river banks. Short grasses interspersed with barren sand patches
characterize the present floodplain.
Initial Reconnaissance and Testing
The first visit to the site was made in late May 1984, when the southeastern part,
which had been stripped largely of topsoil during the previous February, was still
exposed. Vegetation cover had not yet been reestablished due to drought conditions. Many Rangiaflexuosa shells and occasional chert flakes were on or close to
the recently exposed subsoil. In the northernmost edge of the exposed area, near the
crest of the hill, a bulldozer had cut through the original soil profile to reveal a dense
lens of Rangia flexuosa shell, some 10 to 15 cm thick, which seemed to be
concentrated particularly in the area later selected as excavation area B. Exposed
within this shell lens were several chert flakes, marine fish otoliths, and, in addition
to the profuse Rangiaflexuosa, a scattering of oyster shell fragments.
The dense thornbrush covering the crest of the hill made a thorough surface
survey impossible, but the general pattern of distribution of cultural debris was
obtained by careful examination of the ground surface along the various dirt
roadcuts. Scattered Late Prehistoric material--small sandy paste potsherds and
lithic debitage--was noted only where the roadcut cut across the crest of the hill.
Careful examination of the exposed areas on the hill to the south of the crest
produced no such material, suggesting that Late Prehistoric occupation was

8

Texas ArcheologicalSociety

restricted largely to a strip along the crest of the hill. In the areas of shallow
disturbance along the crest that produced Late Prehistoric material, most of the
visible shell debris was of the species Rangia cuneata. On the other hand, the dense
Rangia flexuosa lens, which was initially inferred to have originated during an
earlier Archaic occupation because of the apparent absence of pottery, contained no
cuneata.
So intial observations suggested that McKinzie was a multicomponent site with
(1) a preceramic Archaic component associated with a zone of Rangia flexuosa
midden, and (2) a Late Prehistoric component, the remains of which apparently
were in the upper part of the loam topsoil, primarily along the crest of the hill.
Although the Archaic component appeared to be associated with Rangiaflexuosa,
it seemed that the Late Prehistoric component was associated mainly with Rangia
cuneata, an inference later verified by excavation.
In order to test the validity of these inferences and to ascertain the degree to
which the components might be slratigraphically discrete, a 1-meter square test unit
was staked out near the crest of the hill within what would later be disignated
excavation area A. This unit was troweled in 10-cm arbitrary levels, and all soil was
put through a quarter-inch mesh screen.
Below about the top 2 cm of loose, windblown sandy soil containing grass
rootlets, four zones were defined in the test unit, numbered here from the top down.
Zone I (2-10 cm)
A dark brown sandy clay loam containing relatively abundant cultural material,
including 22 pieces of chert debitage, a sandstone milling stone fragment, and a
small sherd of sandy paste pottery with asphaltum coating the interior surface;
scattered bits of orange burned soil and gray-white ash, mostly between 7 and 10 cm,
also scattered Rangia shells and fragments, mostly Rangia cuneata. The small
sherd ofsandypastepottery suggested aLate Prehistoric occupation. Distinguished
from Zone II by soil differences and relatively abundant cultural material.
Zone I1 (10 to 37-40 cm)
Dark brown sandy clay loam containing scattered fragments and occasional
complete valves of Rangiaflexuosa and cuneata, occasional land snail shells, and
very little lithic debitage (eight pieces from level 2; four from level 3, and six from
level 4); has no ash and burned soil; a discrete, homogeneous stratum.

Zone Ill (37-40 and 50-55 cm)
Lying on the sterile tan B horizon Pleistocene clay was a profusion of Rangia
flexuosa (but noRangia cuneata), encountered throughout the unit between 37 and
40 cm and extending to the 50 to 55 cm depth--a 10-to-15-cm-thick shell midden
stratum Figure 5) from which forty-four pieces of chert debitage and a Catan dart
point were recovered; zone also had a scattering of oyster shells and marine fish
otoliths and relatively abundant lithic material; near base, dark loam soil became
mottled with clay particles, grading into the Zone IV clay below Gig. 4-6, 9, & 10).

THE EXCAVATIONS
Initial impressions from the excavation of the test unit (later integrated into the
mea A excavation as unit N2E0) suggested that this part of the McKinzie site had
a considerable potential to yield data. The narrow vertical disvibution of cukurai
material, ash, and btJ~ed soil in Zone I suggest~ a discrete Late Prehistoric
component, possibly representing no more than a single occupational episode.
(Figures 5-8).The dearth of infbrmation on in~asite patterning in the Coastal Bend
area has imposed severe liraitations on archeological interpretations of prehistoric
adaptations, and the possibility of obtaining such information f?om a Late Prehistoric com~nent was ar~ incentive to conduct further excavation at McKinzie. The
shallow depth of the Zone I deposit meant that exposure of Late Prehistoric features
and associated patterns of cnltrud debris distribution would be relatively easy.
Zone II appeared to have Iittle [~tential for data recovery, due to the dearth of
cultural material ~ere.
The potential of zone III, however, seemed to be sufficient to warrant further
work. The zone was vertically discrete and appeared to correspond to the lens of
dense Raw, gin f[cx~osa shell observed along the northern edge of the bulldozer
disturbance (Figures 9, 10, 11), suggesting a stratum of considerable horizontal
extent. If diagnostic material and a series of radiocarbon dates could be recovered
from Zone III, a step could be t~A(en toward filling the chronological void in the
amheotogical record, for the gzchaic in the Coastal Bend.

is extrapolated from undisturbed surfaces in nearby areas.

With these goals in mind, two areas were selected for further excavation
(Figure 3). From a datum stake designated NOE0 a magnetic north-south base line
was established with the aid a transit, and a contour map was prepared with a contour
interval of .333 meters. The datum point NOE0 was arbitrarily assigned the
elevation of 100.00 meters.
With the north-south base line as a guide, excavation areas A and B (Figure 3)
were staked out in a 1-meter grid. The ground surface at point NOE0 was the vertical
datum; the elevations of the existing ground surface were determined and recorded
for each 1-meter unit.
The general procedure followed during the excavation of areas A and B was to
remove soil in about 1-cm increments within 10-cm arbitrary levels. Vertical and
horizontal positions of all artifacts, including lithic debitage and bone fragments,
were recorded on unit/level data sheets. Because of the large quantities involved,
shell debris was identified by species, counted and recorded by unit level. All soil
was put through quarter-inch screens. The use of eighth-inch screen was considered
and rejected; the sandy clay loam, which tended to crumble into hard lumps when
dry and to be sticky when moist, would have caused considerable difficulty in using
such a fine mesh.
Thirty-three and a half 1-meter units were excavated in area A (Figure 12). Of
these, 26.5 were excavated to a depth of only 10 cm, i.e., to the base of the Late
Prehistoric Zone I deposit. Time allowed the excavation of three of the remaining
seven units through the base of Zone III to depths ranging between 45 and 55 cm.
These units included the original test unit, N2E0, and two adjacent units, N2W 1 and
N2E1. Four units were excavated to 15 cm as a test to confirm that Late Prehistoric
material was contained within the upper 10 cm of the deposit.
Excavation area B was established in an area where the Zone III Rangia

1984. The bulldozer had removed all or part of the natural soil overburden, allowing

ready access to the Zone III midden. Six units were excavated, again in 10-cm
arbitrary levels. Though a slight slope in the original surface upon which Zone Ill
lay was noted as excavation proceeded, horizontal unit levels were maintained
throughout the area. By using the profiles made of each unit wall in combination
with the recorded depths for all cultural material, it was possible to reconstruct
accurately a stratigraphic picture of Zone III and its contents.
It was assumed that the shell stratum in excavation area B corresponded to the
one encountered in the test area, area A (unit N2E0) (Figure 5). A north-south test
trench (Figure 6), 3 meters long by 70 cm wide, excavated between areas A and B
made it possible to evaluate the degree of stratigraphic continuity between the two
areas. Excavation here was with spades, though trowels were used to smooth out
the trench walls, and all soil was screened by 10-cm levels.
The progress of the excavations was recorded on 35 mm color slides and black
and white photographs. Upon completion, the excavations were backfilled and the
datum at point NOE0 was replaced with a stout steel pipe set in concrete for possible
future reference.

ARTIFACTS

Lithic
Dart Points (4 Specimens)
Four dart points were recovered from Zone III. A stemmed dart point oftheBell
type ~urner and Hester 1985:72) was recovered from excavation area B (Figure 13,
A).Both of the heavy barbs diagnostic of the type are broken off on this specimen.
The point has short, parallel, retouch flaking on both surfaces of both blade edges,
a common characteristic of Bell points (Elton Prewitt, personal communication).
Wide, shallow basal thinning flake scars extend to the medial section of the point.
The material is a fine-grained dark gray chert, and the workmanship is excellent.
Dimensions are length, 35 mm; maximum width (estimated with barbs present), 32
mm; thickness, 5.7 mm.
A small unstemmed dart point (Figure 13, B) recovered from the initial test unit
N2E0 conforms morphologically to the Catan type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:172,
Turner and Hester 1985:78). Edges have precise pressure flaking but no alternate
beveling. The material is fine-grained dark brown chert, and workmanship is
excellent. Dimensions are length, 31 mm; maximum width, 20 mm; maximum
thickness, 6.3 mm.
A small, triangular dart point (Fig. 13,C) with convex base and slightly convex
edges was recovered from excavation area B. This point does not conform well to
any established type, though it resembles most closely certain illustrated examples
of the Catan type (see Suhm and Jelks 1962, plate 88, C and D; Turner and Hester
1985, lower left specimen on page 78). Broad shallow basal flake scars extend to
the pointâs midsection. There is no alternate beveling of the blade edges. Dimensions are: length, 32 mm; maximum width, 22 mm; maximum thickness, 5.4 mm.

A triangular dart point with a medial break reworked into a gougelike edge
(Figure 13, D) was recovered from the surface of the exposed Zone III shell midden
40 cm east of excavation area B, unit $6E2. Though a surface find, the context is
certain, since the point was securely embedded in the compact Zone III matrix. The
point has broad basal thinning flake scars and marked alternate edge beveling,
conforming well to the Tortugas type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:249; Turner and Hester
1985:152). The material is a tan, moderately fine grained chert; the workmanship
is good. Dimensions are maximum width. 23.6 mm; maximum thickness, 7.3 mm.

Scrapers (2 Specimens)
A thick unifacial specimen of gray chert has flaked beveling on the end and on
one side ~igure 13, F). The edge angle ranges between 48Â° and 63Â°. Dimensions

are length, 39 mm; maximum width, 25 mm; maximum thickness, 17 mm. This
specimen was found on the exposed surface of the Rangiaflexuosa midden, so its
association with Zone III is open to question.
A fragment of a large flake with fine-flaked edge beveling was excavated from
unit $7E2 in area B. The material is light gray, medium-fine-grained chert. The
edge angle is 56Â°.
Probable Clear Fork Tool Fragment (1 Specimen)
This unifacial artifact (Figure 13, E) of moderately fine grained gray chert was
recovered from Zone III in the test trench. The inferred dorsal face has a slightly
convex flaked edge that is at a 56Â° angle to the unflaked ventral face. Minute flakes
along the inferred working edge indicate edge crushing resulting from usage.
Biface Fragment (1 Specimen)
This specimen is of moderately fine grained tan chert. It is roughly percussion
flaked and is possibly a preform fragment.
Utilized Flakes (10 Specimens)
Ten utilized flakes were recovered from the Zone III excavation (Figure 13, HJ). Three were found in area A, unit N2E0, one was found in the test trench, and the
remainder were scattered throughout the area B excavation. Four specimens have
use-wear along two edges, and one has concave use-worn edges (Figure 13, J).
Obsidian Flake (1 Specimen)
A single very small flake of gray-brown obsidian was recovered from unit
S7E1, excavation area B. This specimen is roughly circular and has a distinct bulb
of percussion. Diameter is 6-7 mm, and maximum thickness is 0.7 mm.
Chert Debitage (233 Specimens)
In all, 233 pieces of chert debitage were found in the Zone III excavations. No
patterning was seen in the distribution of this material. All specimens are slightly
to moderately patinated, as are all of the chert artifacts described above. One
hundred twenty-eight pieces are complete flakes; the sample comprises seven (5
percent) primary (cortex) flakes, 15 (12 percent) secondary (secondary cortex)
flakes, 47 (37 percent) tertiary (interior) flakes, and 59 (46 percent) biface-thinning
(lipped) flakes.
One hundred five specimens are either fragmentary flakes (i.e., proximal end
is missing) or amorphous chunks of shattered chert. Of the 95 flake fragments, eight
(8.5 percent) are primary, 16 (17 percent) are secondary, and 71 (74.5 percent) are
interior flakes.
The presence of the primary and secondary cortex flakes indicates that primary
reduction of chert cobbles was taking place on the site, despite the absense of lithic
resources in the vicinity. The source of the lithic material is not known, but a recent
paper by C. K. Chandler (1984) describes abundant chert cobbles along the banks
of the Nueces River some 20 km upstream from the site. This is the nearest known

source of workable chert.
The rather high proportion of biface thinning flakes in the Zone III sample
indicates some emphasis on bifacial tool production during this period of the siteâs
occupation.

Shell (2 Specimens)
A complete oyster shell valve (Figure 14, A) has an artificial perforation 4.6
mm in diameter near the umbo. The function of the artifact is unknown, but
Campbell (1958a) has suggested that perforated oyster shells may have served as
net weights.
A single fragment of oyster shell (Figure 14, B) is unique in that it appears to
have been modified to a rectangular shape.
Zone II
Lithic (47 Specimens)
The only lithic artifacts from Zone II are a few pieces of chert debitage
scattered, apparently at random, throughout the zone. Of the 47 pieces recovered,
31 are complete flakes, 2 (7 percent) of which are primary flakes, 6 (19 percent) are
secondary, 14 (45 percent) are tertiary, and 9 (29 percent) are biface-thinning flakes.

A fragment of conch shell adze (Figure 14, C), a commonly reported artifact
from the Archaic sites in the Coastal Bend area (e.g. Campbell 1947, 1952, Mokry
1980), was found in the test trench, level 2 (10-20 cm).

Zone I
Lithic
Arrowpoints (3 Specimens)
Two arrowpoints are identifiable as the Perdiz type. One specimen (Figure 15,
B), recovered from unit N6E2, excavation area A, is unifacially flaked, except for
the contracting bifacially flaked stem. The shoulders on this point are barbed,
though one barb is broken off. The blade edges are serrated. Material is fine-grained
brown chert. Maximum thickness is 1.8 mm.
The second Perdiz type arrowpoint (Figure 15, A) is a surface find from the
roadcut at the east end of the hilltop. Though not from the Zone I excavation, it
clearly comes from the Late Prehistoric, so it is described here. It is unifacially
worked except on the contracting stem, which is bifacially pressure flaked; the blade
edges are serrated. Material is light brown chert, moderately fine grained.
Dimensions are length, 31 mm; maximum width, 23 mm; maximum thickness, 3.2
mm.
A third specimen (Figure 15, C), recovered from unit N6E0, apparently is the
distal end of a unifacial arrowpoint with serrated blade edges. It is made from
moderately fine grained brown chert.

Bifacially Modified Chert (2 Specimens)
One of the two specimens of bifacially worked chert recovered from Zone I
(Figure 15, E) is the distal end of an alternately beveled tool, possibly a knife or a
dart point recovered from unit N5E2, excavation area A. The material is a rather
coarse-grained chertlike moderately patinated purple stone, unique to the site.
Maximum thickness of this fragment is 8 mm.
The second specimen, recovered from unit N5E4, excavation area A, is a
relatively large secondary cortex flake of moderately fine grained brown chert
(Figure 15, D) that has been bifacially edge flaked to produce a triangular form.
Absence of edge pressure flaking suggests an unfinished tool, possibly an arrowpoint preform. Dimensions are length 38 mm; maximum width, 28 mm; maximum
thickness, 6 mm.
End Scraper (1 Specimen)
A unifacial secondary cortex flake of reddish brown chert (Figure 15, F),
recovered from unit N2E3, excavation area A, has a beveled end created by a series
of fine pressure flake removals. The edge angle is 68Â°. Dimensions are length, 28
mm; maximum width, 29 mm; thickness, 6.7 mm.

Utilized Flakes (12 Specimens)
Twelve utilized flakes were recovered from zone I (Figure 15, K, L). Six
specimens are secondary cortex flakes and six are interior flakes. The material is
a moderately coarse to fine-grained chert. Ten are of various shades of brown, one
is light yellow-tan, and one is light gray. All are qtfite small; the largest is 35 by 28
mm.
Core (1 Specimen)
Only one core (Figure 15, M) was found in the Zone I excavation. The
specimen, from unit N5E4, is of reddish brown, moderately fine grained chert and
retains cortex on about five percent of its surface. Flakes have been struck from both
a flat, prepared platform and the lateral edge of the cobble. Dimensions are length,
45 mm; width, 50 mm; maximum thickness, 24 mm.
Quartzite Chip (1 Specimen)
A small chip of hard, fine-grained purple quartzite, recovered from unit N6E 1,
has minute pitting on its exterior surface. It is probably a chip from a hammerstone,
since cobbles of this material often served as hammerstones in southern Texas (e.g.
Hester and Hill 1972).
Debitage (596 Specimens)
Five hundred ninety-six flakes, flake fragments, and chert chunks were found
in Zone I. Because color variation within cobbles makes it impossible to determine
which cobble the flakes came from, it is difficult to determine how many cobbles
are represented by the Zone I debitage. A wide range of shades of brown
predominates in the sample, together with some reddish, light tan-yellow, and light
grays. The debitage was sorted by gross color and grain characteristics into 36
groups, which probably represent at least that many cobbles. Of the total sample of
596 specimens, 275 are flakes, 293 are flake fragments, and 28 are chunks. Most
flakes are quite small and, judging by the curvatures of primary flake exteriors,
cobbles were generally 10 cm or less in diameter. Flakes were sorted into primary
(23, or 8 percent), secondary ( 51, or 19 percent), tertiary (97, or 35 percent), and
biface-thinning (104, or 38 percent).

22

Texas Areheologieal Society

The 293 flake fragments were divided into primary (20, or 7 percent),
secondary (49, or 17 percent), and tertiary (224, or 76 percent).
These data clearly indicate that the Zone I occupants of the site were engaged
in all phases of lithic tool production, from initial cobble reduction to biface
manufacturing.

Milling Stone Fragments (2 Specimens)
Two specimens of modified sandstone, both of which have slight, relatively
smooth concavities on one surface, are identified as milling stone fragments. One
specimen was recovered from unit N2E0 in the Zone I excavation (Figure 16, B);
the other was in apparent association with a cluster of sandy paste potsherds on a
shallow dirt roadcut northwest of excavation area A (Figure 16, A).

Shell (2 Specimens)
Two edge fragments ofRangia cuneata valves (Figure 17, A and B) from Zone
I have serrated edges produced by flaking. These specimens presumably were used
as scraping or cutting tools.
Modified Bone (3 Specimens)
Due to their small size (Figure 17, C-E), the original forms from which these
small bone tool fragments came cannot be determined. Surface polish and minute
striations on all three indicate that they could be awl fragments. Interestingly, these
are the only fire-scorched bone fragments found, so it is possible that a firehardening technique was used in the production of bone tools.
Ceramic (197 Sherds)
In all, 197 sherds were recovered from Zone I. Except for a single bonetempered sherd, all are of sandy paste and conform well to the Rockport ware series
as defined by Suhm and Jelks (1962:131-135).
On the basis of color, paste, thickness, and surface treatment, the sherds have
been sorted into the nine groups described below.

from the Zone I excavation. Cross sections show contours of exteriors.

Group 1 (134 Sherds) (Figure 18, A and Figure 19, E)
The exteriors of these sherds are smoothed, and some have an asphaltum
coating or rather amorphous decoration; interiors are smoothed. The paste consists
of about 50 to 60 percent fine angular sand particles of fairly uniform size. Exteriors
are gray, grading to orange on a few sherds. Interiors are orange. Close to the
surface, cores have a fairly sharp gradient from the gray exteriors to the orange
interiors. The sherds range between 5 and 9 mm in thickness.
Eight sherds in this group are rim sherds. All have straight rim profiles and
slightly thickened lips. Rims are slightly flattened, with rounded interior and exterior lips. All have a narrow asphaltum band on the lip exterior (see Figure 18, A).
Since the sherds in Group 1 are a considerably homogeneous group they are
believed, with some confidence, to come from a single vessel. Curvatures of rim,

neck, and body sherds suggest an open-mouthed, somewhat straight-necked,
globular-based vessel with an oral diameter of about 25 cm. On the basis of
asphaltum lip decoration, this vessel can be assigned to the Rockport Black on Gray
type (Suhm and Jelks 1962: 133).
Group 2 (36 Sherds) (Figures 18, E and F, 19, C and D)
The exterior surfaces in this sherd group are smoothed. Nine sherds are scored
and have asphaltum-coated interiors, and 10 sherds have interiors smoothed with
asphaltum coating; the remaining sherds have plain and smoothed interiors. Except
for two rim sherds that have asphaltum banding on lip exteriors, the exteriors of the
sherds are without asphaltum. The paste consists of about 50 percent fine sand
particles of fairly uniform size. The sherds are uniformly tan throughout, though a
few are tinged with pink at the cores. Thickness of the sherds varies from 4 to 6 mm.

26

Texas Archeological Society

Both of the rim sherds in this group have straight profiles, rounded lips, and
narrow asphaltum banding on lip exteriors (see Figure 18, E and F).
In view of the fact that some sberd interiors have asphaltum coating and others
have none, Group 2 may represent two vessels.

Group 3 (18 Sherds)
The interiors and exteriors of sherds in this group are smoothed. Most sherds
have traces of asphaltum on their exteriors. The paste consists of about 50 percent
fine sand particles. Exteriors are light tan-gray, and interiors and cores are gray.
Thickness ranges between 5 and 7 mm. The homogeneity of the sherds in this group
suggests that they came from a single vessel.
Group 4 (3 Sherds) (Figure 18, C)
Sherds in this group are smoothed on both surfaces. One rim sherd has a narrow
band of asphaltum on the lip exterior. The paste consists of about 40 percent fine
sand particles. Sherd color is uniformly yellowish tan throughout. Thickness
ranges between 4.5 and 6.5 mm.
The single rim sherd in Group 4 (Figure 18, C) has a straight profile and a
rounded lip with a band of asphaltum on the exterior edge. On the basis of the
asphaltum lip banding, this sherd can be assigned to the Rockport Black on Gray
type.

Group 5 (3 Sherds) (Figure 18, D)
A thin exterior grayish white film on the sherds in this group may be a slip or
a floated surface; interiors are smoothed. Paste consists of about 40 to 50 percent
fine sand particles. The sherds are oxidized to an orange-pink color throughout.
Thickness ranges between 3.5 and 3.7 mm.
On the exterior of the single rim sherd in the group is what appears to be
smoothed-over scoring and a band of asphaltum at the lip (Figure 18, D). The
asphaltum banding places this sherd in the Rockport Black on Gray type. In cross
section the rim is nearly pointed and slightly everted.
The thickness, sherd curvatures, and homogeneity within the group indicate
that a single very small vessel is represented.
Group 6 (1 Sherd)
Both the exterior and interior surfaces of this sherd are smooth and
highly burnished. Paste consists of about 50 percent very fine sand particles. Color
is very light tan throughout. Thickness is 3.6 mm.
The attributes of this sherd are distinctly different from those in other groups,
indicating that it is from a separate vessel.
Group 7 (1 Sherd) (Figure 19, F)
The exterior of this sherd is smooth; the interior is smooth and slightly
burnished. On the exterior surface are thin, roughly parallel vertical lines of
asphaltum. Paste consists of about 50 percent fine sand particles. The interior and

Ricklis ~ The McKinzie Site

27

exterior surfaces are light tan; the core is gray. Thickness varies from 5 to 6 mm.
The curvature of this sherd indicates that it is part of the neck of a bottle. On
the basis of the asphaltum decoration, the sherd can be assigned to the Rockport
Black on Gray type.
Group 8 (1Sherd)
The exterior of this sherd is smoothed; the interior is smoothed and coated with
asphaltum. Paste consists of about 60 percent fine sand particles. The exterior is
orange; interior and core are gray. Thickness is 4.9 mm.
Group 9 (1 Sherd) (Figure 19,A)
The exterior of this sherd is smooth and slightly burnished; the interior is
roughly smoothed. Aplastics in the clay body consist of about 20 percent sand
particles of variable size and 20 percent crushed bone. The exterior grades from
orange to dull yellow-orange; the core and interior are gray. Thickness ranges
between 5 and 7.5 mm.
This is the only sherd in the Zone I sample that does not belong in the Rockport
series. The sherd most closely resembles, in paste, color, and surface treatment
bone-temperd pottery reported from the interior of southern Texas (c.f. Hester and
Hill 1975, 1977). This sherd clearly is from the base of a flat-bottomed vessel, a
form that is not known in the central Texas coast area, and only one example of
which is reported from the interior of southern Texas (Hester and Hill 1975).

Discussion
With the exception of the single sherd in Group 9, all sherds fall within therange
of variability of Rockport ware. Though most sherds are small, curvatures indicate
diverse vessel forms, including open-mouthed jars, narrow-necked or bottle forms,
and a very small, thin vessel (Group 5) that probably was more of a cup than a pot.
These vessel forms demonstrate the possibility of a variety of functions for the Zone
I ceramics. It is not demonstrable, but it is reasonable to infer that the open-mouthed,
fairly large jar (Group 1) was a cooking pot, and the narrow-necked forms served
as water containers.
FAUNAL REMAINS
Zone III
Bone
Unfortunately, Zone III was characterized by a complete absence of bone,
almost certainly the result of decay.
Shell
The density of shell debris in Zone III was considerable and supports the
identification of the deposit as a shell midden (Table 2).
The Rangia flexuosa count is based on whole valves and umbo fragments, so
halving it accurately reflects the number of clams represented in the excavated part
of the zone. The ether aquatic species counts, however, are based on fragments, so

the number of animals represented is somewhat less than the number in Table 2.
Clearly it can be concluded, however, that Rangia flexuosa was the significant
shellfish resource exploited by the Zone III occupants of the site and that oysters
played a very minor subsistence role.
The count of Rabdotus land snails is based on complete shells. Occasionally,
the smaller Polygyra and Helicina land snails were encountered, but these shells
were extremely fragile and disintegrated under the trowel. It is unclear whether the
Rabdotus snails were gathered for food, since the species is adapted to a terrestrial
habitat and the recovered specimens may represent natural deaths within the
population. This seems a reasonable conclusion, since these shells were not
particularly abundant in the midden. RecentRabdotus shells can be seen scattered
over the ground surface on, and in the vicinity of, the site.

Fish
Thirty-two marine fish otoliths were recovered from zone III (Table 3).

The season when marine fish died can be determined by microscopic examination of the cross sections of fish otoliths (see Casteel 1976, Smith 1983).
Although the method of determination of seasonality is essentially quite simple, it
can be complicated by two factors: (1) erratic growth patterns, possibly caused by
abnormal fluctuations in water temperatures, can obscure annual growth bands, (2)
the fish may have been too young at the time of death for the otoliths to have
accumulated a sufficient number of growth bands for a reliable estimation of the

width of the annuli.
So of the 32 otoliths recovered from Zone III, the season of death can be
determined with a reasonable degree of confidence for only 21 (Table 4).

Though the sample is not large, the distinct seasonal clustering of otoliths in the
late fall-winter period strongly suggests that occupation of Zone III was primarily
during that season.
Zone II
Bone
Bone in Zone II is limited to sporadic occurences of small, unidentifiable
splinters, mostly in the upper part of the zone, becoming increasingly scarce with
depth until they are entirely absent in the lowest part of the zone.
Shell
A scattering of land snails (Rabdotus, Polygyra, and Helicina) with no apparent
horizontal or vertical clustering was encountered.
Both Rangia flexuosa and Rangia cuneata were present, and though these
shells occurred sporadically and without the association of time-diagnostic artifacts, an interesting and probably significant pattern can be seen in the vertical
distribution of the twoRangia species. The percentages of Rangiaflexuosa relative
to Rangia cuneata decrease by 10-cm levels from 100 percent in Zone III to about
27 percent in zone I (Table 5).

extended slightly into Zone II.

From Table 5 it is clear that there is a shift in Zone II, where the species
percentages are intermediate between Zones I and III. The apparent discrepancy in
percentages per level between the test trench and unit N2E0 is due to the downsloping of the zones toward the south of the test trench (see profile, Figure 4) where the
arbitrary levels were horizontal. Percentages have not been calculated for level 1
in the test trench due to the small sample size. The percentages for unit N2E0, level
1, can be regarded as reliable, since the relative percentages for the two species in
the entire southern part of the area A, zone I (level 1) excavation (16 1-meter
squares) are virtually identical: flexuosa 27.3 percent; cuneata 72.7 percent. The
significance of these figures in a reconstruction of environmental change in the
lower Nueces estuary will be discussed below.
Zone I
Bone
Bone preservation in Zone I was good, presumably due to the recentness of the
occupation. In the list of fragments below, only one individual of each species is
definitely represented: nineteen bison (Bison bison) fragments (1 radius, 9 ribs, 9
long bones); two white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus); 22 carapace fragments
from an unidentified turtle; one radio-ulna fragment from an unidentified frog; 4
long bone splinters from an unidentified bird; and 51 small unidentified bone
fragments.
A tibia fragment of domestic pig, also recovered from Zone I, is in a markedly
better state of preservation than the other mammal bones and is presumed to come
from the historic occupation of the site.
Shell
The shells recovered from Zone I were Rangia cuneata (879 valves and
umbos), Rangiaflexuosa (456 valves and umbos), Oyster (Crassostrea virginica)
(45 fragments), and Sunray venus (Macrocallista) (2 fragments).
It is believed that the overall representation of Rangiaflexuosa in Zone I is
somewhat greater than its actual usage by the Zone I occupants implies. Much

Figure 20. Plan showing occurrences ofRangia cuneata v alves/umbos in Zone I, excavation
area A.

higher numbers of this species came from the northernmost units in the Area A
excavation than from elsewhere in the site. From examination of the area just to the
north of the excavation it was clear that at some time soil there had been disturbed
well into Zone III and that some of the Zone III soil had been redeposited onto the
original surface of Zone I during the historic occupation of the site. This was most
apparent in N7E4, where the top 5 to 7 cm produced more than 50 valves of Rangia
flexuosa, but no Rangia cuneata and no Late Prehistoric material. Beneath the 5to 7-cm level, however, the Zone I deposit was intact and produced the characteristic
association of sandy paste potsherds with unpatinated chert debitage.
Due to this bias in the quantities of Rangiaflexuosa, only the densities per
1-meter-square unit of Rangia cuneata are considered reliable. In general, the
highest densities ofRangia cuneata occur in a roughly U-shaped band in the area
A, Zone I excavation ~igure 20). The significance of this will be discussed below.
One hundred seventy-oneRabdotus and 67 smaller land snail shells (Polygyra
and Helicina) were recorded for Zone I. As in Zones II and IH, the significance of
these shells is problematical, though it can be stated again that no patterning or
clustering was observable in their distribution.
A sample of 77 complete Rangia cuneata valves was subjected to seasonality
analysis, using the method developed by Lawrence Aten (1981). The McKinzie
sample broke down into Atenâs analytical categories as follows: Early, 27 (35
percent); Middle, 17 (22 percent); Late, 5 (6 percent); Interrupted, 17 (22 percent);

32

Texas Archeological Society

Indeterminate, 11 (15 percent).
Aten has presented a series of two-week histograms based on patterns of
proportional representation of the above categories in modem Rangia samples from
the upper and central Texas coast. So ideally, for example, a site producing Rangia
cuneata and occupied in early April should yield a shell sample that, when broken
down into the Atenâs analytical categories, will conform to the two-week histogram
for the period between the end of March and the middle of April.
The McKinzie sample would fit best the period from the end of April to midMay (although this must be extrapolated from the two adjacent histograms in the
sequence because this interval is one for which Aten had no sample and, therefore,
no histogram. See Aten 1981:187), except for the fact that the interrupted category
is much too well represented. Atenâs samples show the representation of the
interrupted category to be 8 percent for end of April and 4 percent for end of May,
so to infer deposition of the McKinzie sample during that period would require that
the interrrupted category fall around 4 to 8 percent.
Clearly the Zone I sample indicates a spring occupation in the light of Atenâs
histograms. But at what time during the spring, and for how long, is not clear from
a glance at the histograms. Two possible explanations can be offered for the
discrepancy between the McKinzie sample and Atenâs histogram sequence: (1) The
sample shows an overrepresentation of interrupted shells due to admixture with
shells deposited during another occupation that was earlier in the year, or (2) the
sample represents a single occupational episode spanning more than the two-week
interval represented by each histogram.
As will be discussed below, there is a general spatial correspondence between
the distribution of Rangia cuneata and artifacts and features in Zone I. So the
Rangia cuneata shells recovered probably came from a single occupational episode.
Working on this assumption, the discrepancy between the McKinzie sample and
Atenâs histograms is most economically explained by postulating that the Zone I
occupation spanned a period of more than two weeks.
This postulate was tested by averaging the percentages of shells falling into the
respective analytical categories (Early, Middle Late, and Interrupted) in Atenâs
spring histograms (the middle of March to the end of May). Since the indeterminate
category is a more-or-less constant residual consisting of shells that could not be
placed in any other category, it was eliminated in order to simplify comparisons.
When the percentage figures for the six spring histograms were averaged, the results
compared very closely with the McKinzie sample (Table 6).
These figures strongly support the inference that the McKinzieRangia cuneata
sample indicates an occupational episode spanning all or the better part of the period
between the middle of March and the end of May. So apparently we are dealing here
with something approaching a full seasonal occupation. Since Atenâs histograms
cannot account for possible minor differences in samples due to location or seasonal
variation in any given year, attempts to make more precise estimates of the time of
occupation would be of little value. In any case, for the purposes of this report, the
inference of a single episode of occupation, the duration of which approximated the
spring season, is adequate.

Fish
Despite reasonably good preservation of bone in zone I, only two marine fish
otoliths were found--one hardhead catfish and one trout. They were found in the
northern part of the excavation and may come from the thinly redeposited Zone III
soil in that part of excavation area A.
FEATURES

Zone IlI
No cultural features were encountered in Zone HI.
Zone II
Feature 6-A
A single distinct feature found in Zone II was designated Feature 6-A. The
feature was in the western part of unit N5E0 in excavation area A, and, because of
mottling of ashy and burned soil caused by animal burrowing between the two
features, was first believed to be a downward extension of Feature 6, which was
clearly a hearth associated with Zone I. Horizontal exposure of the feature surface
and a cross section, however, demonstrated that Feature 6-A actually originated at
about 20 to 25 cm below the modern ground surface and extended to as much as 55
cm below ground surface.
The exposed surface of the feature was roughly semicircular, and the profile
was roughly U-shaped. Fill was predominantly orange burned loam soil mixed with
a great deal of gray-white ash that contained only a few minute flecks of charcoal.
A 5-gallon bucket of fill was water-screened through fine mesh window screening
in a search for minute carbonized organic matter, but there was none. In the fill were
72 whole and fragmentary Rangia shells and three pieces of chert debitage.
Zone I
Hearths
Feature 4
This feature, located in units N4E0 and N4E1, originated between 7 and 10 cm
below the modern ground surface. The hearth was oblong and merged with an

34

Texas Archeological Society

adjacent hearth, Feature 6, in unit N5E0 to the north. It measured 37 cm east-west
by about 100 cm north-south.
The fill of Feature 4 was predominantly reddish-orange burned loam with
scattered ash, but no charcoal. Excavation of the fill revealed a shallow basinlike
depression with a maximum depth of 16 cm.
Feature 5
This hearth originated at 7 to 9 cm below modern ground surface. It is elongated
and irregular, measuring 218 cm north-south by 92 cm east-west. The fill was
reddish orange burned soil mixed sporadically with brown ashy loam and graywhite ash. The fill contained no charcoal.
Removal of the fill revealed a shallow basin with a maximum depth of 11 cm.
A single fragment of a large mammal long bone, probably bison, was recovered
from the surface of the feature.
Feature 6
This hearth ~igure 21) originated at 8 to 10 cm below the modern ground
surface in units N5E0, N5E1, N6E0 and N6E1. In plan it was an irregular oval
measuring 155 by 107 cm. The fill consisted of sizeable patches of reddish-orange
loam soil, gray-white ash, and dark brown ashy loam.
In the fill were several matching fragments of bison radius and three chert
flakes, all in the southeastern part of the feature. A fill sample was fine waterscreened for possible carbonized plant remains, but the results were negative. The
screening did yield 11 minute chert flakes and a handful of very small Rangia
fragments. Except for an occasional minute fleck, no charcoal was associated with
this feature.

Feature 7
This hearth ~igure 22) was exposed at a depth of 9 to 10 cm in the northern part
of unit N6W2. Only the southern part was excavated, since the feature extended into
unexcavated unit N7W2. Its maximum observable dimension was 51 cm. The fill
was a patchy mixture of reddish-orange burned loam, gray-white ash, and ashy
brown loam, but no charcoal. The basin-shaped profile had a maximum depth of
23 cm.
Burned Loam Patches
In addition to these distinct hearths, three patches of reddish orange burned
loam were noted at 7 to 10 cm below ground surface. Two were located to the east
of Feature 5; the third was to the south of Feature 4 in unit N1E0 (designated Feature
2 in the field). Though these may be small, short-term hearths, their small size and
shallow (1-3 cm) depth suggest scatters of burned soil, perhaps displaced from
Features 4 and 5 during the Zone 1 occupation.
Ash Patches
Several patches of gray-white ash, not assigned feature numbers, were exposed

were encountered between 7 and 10 cm below ground surface and ranged between
2 and 4 cm in thickness. In two instances the ash patches were adjacent to hearths
(Features 6 and 7). As indicated in Figure 12, all, except for the patch next to Feature
7, were within 2 meters of Features 4, 5, and 6, andpresumably are scatter from those
hearths.

Pit
A small pit (Figure 23), designated Feature 8, was found in the southwestern
part of unit N7E2, when, as the unit floor was brushed down at the 10-cm level, a

first believed to be a rodent burrow, careful removal of the fill revealed a clearly
oval, 32-by-21-cm U-shaped pit, as much as 18 cm deep. The soft, ashy fill
contrasted markedly in texture with the compact loam matrix. No burned soil or
fire-staining, which would indicate in situ burning, were seen.
In the fill were a single sandy paste potsherd (sherd Group 1) three chert flakes,
and 23 small Rangia fragments.
Possible Pits
At the time of the excavation of the northern part of excavation area A, Zone
I, infrared photographs were made of the floors of the 1-meter units at the 10-cm
level. The photographs were taken from directly overhead by using a lift bucket,
so it was possible to make each one cover a single excavation unit. Four dark

circular spots that could not be seen from the ground were detected on the
photographs (Figure 12). These spots, all about 30-35 cm in diameter, were rather
evenly spaced in an arc around the hearths, Features 4, 5, and 6. It is interesting, and
probably significant, that the definable pit, Feature 8, is about the same size as the
spots, and its location fits into the arclike pattern. Apparently a series of small pits,
including the pit, Feature 8, was arranged around the hearth area delineated by
Features 4, 5, and 6.
It must be stated, however, that, after the locations of these possible pits were
plotted on the field map, it was not possible, despite meticulous brushing, scraping,
and probing, to find any trace of pits. During the excavation at the site, however,
it was noticed that the excavated sandy clay loam, when backfilled and exposed to
a few rains, returned to its original compact state.Therefore, pits that existed during
the Late Prehistoric occupation had been filled with loam (without the admixture of
the ash that permitted the recognition of Feature 8), it is possible that no evidence
of pits could be found by ordinary field techniques.

Possible Post Molds
Four possible small post molds (Figures 24, 25, and 12) were exposed at the 10cm level. These features could not be seen, but were felt as distinct soft spots during

brushing of exposed, dry unit floors. More than two dozen small soft spots were
recognized in this way, and all were carefully scooped out from the dried, hardened
loam matrix. A few were also cross-sectioned. All but four were clearly small
animal burrows, but the four possible post molds were circular in plan and bluntly
conical in cross section (Figure 25).
The fill of these post molds was sandy, with little clay content, and the texture
was easily distinguishable from that of the surrounding sandy clay loam. It is
possible that they were the filled-in impressions of small posts that had been
removed from the ground (Table 7).

Texas Archeological Society

Aten (1983a, Appendix 1) has reported considerable success in obtaining
reliable radiocarbon dates from Rangia cuneata shells on the Upper Gulf Coast of
Texas. Salvatore Valastro (personal communication), of the Radiocarbon Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin, states that Rangia flexuosa should
produce similar results.
Aten has suggested, on the basis of comparisons of dates obtained on charcoal
and on Rangia cuneata from the same archeological contexts, that dates obtained
fromRangia are generally slightly older than dates from charcoal (Aten 1983a:330341). In the Trinity River delta area on the Upper Texas Coast, Rangia cuneata
samples yield dates that are about 225 years earlier than those produced by charcoal.
Aten had postulated that the discrepancy is due to the absorption of carbon ions by
living clams and that the higher the levels of bicarbonate in the aquatic environment,
the greater the resultant discrepancy in radiocarbon dates. The amount of bicarbonate in turn correlates with the proximity of the estuary system where the clams lived
to the limestone formations of Central Texas. SoRangia samples from the mouth
of the Sabine River, for example, should produce dates very nearly the same as those
from charcoal in the same context, since the Sabine drainage is largely free of
dissolved carbonates from Central Texas limestone. In contrast, samples ofRangia
from the Lavaca River estuary are predicted to produce age determinations that are
some 800 to 1000 years too old, since much of the Lavaca drainage is in the Central
Texas limestone region.
Aten has summarized his correlations of the recorded bicarbonate counts (mg/
liter) in the waters of various Upper Coast estuaries and predicted age deviations of
shell samples as a logarithmic regression. The average bicarbonate count from test
locations in Nueces and Corpus Christibays for the mid- 1970s is 183 mg/liter (Lind
1980). Accordng to Atenâs regression model (Aten 1983a:340), this amount of
bicarbonate should produce a date on Rangia shell that is about 300 years too old.
Based on this prediction, the Rangia radiocarbon dates at McKinzie would indicate
a Zone III occupation at about 49~ B.P. However, it is probably unrealistic to be
so precise, since Atenâs regression model is, as he himself states (1983a:339),
preliminary. Furthermore, modern bicarbonate counts from Nueces and Corpus
Christi bays may be significantly different from those in the vicinity of the site
during the Zone III occupation due to differences in the bay environment over the
millenia. Bicarbonate counts are affected by the degree of interchange between
estuarine and sea waters; counts for estuary and bay waters become increasingly
uniform and, in the case of the Nueces/Corpus Christi Bay system, increasingly
lower from the heads of the bays toward the Gulf of Mexico (see Lind 1980). So
before the barrier islands were formed the bicarbonate count in the waters near the
McKinzie site probably was lower than at present. Only the recovery and testing
of paired charcoal/Rangia samples from the area will permit more accurate
assessment of the degree of age deviation possible in Rangia samples from the
charcoal norm.
The consistency of results in dating the Zone III samples and the general
reliability of Rangia suggests that the Zone III dates are reasonably reliable
approximations of the age of the occupations. Although it must be kept in mind that

Ricklis ~ The McKinzie Site

41

the dates may be too early, such deviation does not create serious interpretive
problems in the light of the roughly 5,000-year time frame involved.
Zone II
No samples were submitted for dating from Zone II, since, without associated
diagnostic artifacts, radiocarbon determinations would have been valueless for
cultural chronology.
Zone I
The tiny bits of charcoal that occurred sporadically in Zone I could have been
gathered for radiocarbon dating, but it was deemed that such dates would be
unreliable because of the strong possibility that, at their shallow depth, they had
been contaminated by charcoal of more recent origin and becauseRangia shell tends
to yield dates that are several centuries too early. Therefore no samples were
submitted from Zone I for radiocarbon dating. However, it can be inferred that the
Late Prehistoric occupation at McKinzie dates between about A.D. 1300/1400 and
the eighteenth century. Though to date no radiocarbon dates have been published
for the Late Prehistoric Rockport complex, the predominance ofPerdiz arrowpoints
in the Rockport assemblage (see Corbin 1974) suggests a post-A.D.-1300/1400
time, since this point type has been so dated in adjacent interior southern and southcentral Texas (see Prewitt 1985; Black 1986). The presence on Rockport sites of
European trade material and arrowpoints made from bottle glass (Campbell 1958b;
Corbin 1963, 1974) indicates that the Rockport complex persisted into the period
of European contact.
SITE-SPECIFIC INTERPRETATIONS
Zone III
On the basis of dart points and an average date of 5220+90 B.P. for the three
radiocarbon dates (Table 8), Zone III can be assigned to a fairly early period in the
Archaic stage. The radiocarbon dates are supported by the occurrence in Zone III
of a Bell dart point. Prewitt has estimated the time range for Bell points in Central
Texas as about 4100 to 3100 B.C. (Prewitt 1981, 1985). So the average of the
McKinzie Zone III dates appears to fit the Central Texas chronology suggested by
Prewitt.
The Tortugas point from Zone III is also probably at home within the time frame
suggested by the radiocarbon dates, since this point type has been estimated to date
to the Early and Middle Archaic in southern Texas (Turner and Hester 1985:152).
The presence of the small Catan and Catan-like points at about 5000 B.P.,
however, is at variance with the previously suggested time range for such points in
southern Texas. It has been suggested that the Catan point is a Late Archaic type
(see Hester 1980b:98; Tumer and Hester 1985:78), and Hester has postulated that
the type may represent the later end of a continuum involving progressive diminuition from the larger but morphologically similar Abasolo type.
Data from Nuevo Leon in northeastern Mexico, however, are not inconsistent
with a relatively early occurrence of Catan and Catan-like points and may have more

42

Texas Archeological Society

relevance for the southern Texas region than has been apparent. As indicated by a
series of radiocarbon dates, Catan and Catan-like points are found at the Cueva de
la Zona de Derrumbes site by about 3000 B.C. (Epstein 1972, 1980; McClurkan
1980:61). The type is also found in unit 32, alevel datedby uncorrected radiocarbon
determinations to between 3450 and 2450 B.C. (Nance 1980:43-44), at the La
Calsada site.
Although the McKinzie Zone III sample is small, the association of all four dart
points with the dated shell samples is excellent. Vertical displacement of materials
can be ruled out confidently since all of the nearly 13,000 Rangia specimens
recovered and identified as to species were Rangia flexuosa. Despite the
occurrence ofRangia cuneata at the base of Zone II, no specimens were found in
Zone III, indicating that there was no downward displacement of material. Too, all
chert debitage in Zone III had slight-to-moderate patination that was not characteristic of higher zones. The dart points were similarly patinated, suggesting undisturbed association with the Zone III debris.
On the basis of the Catan and Catan-like points in Zone III, dated to about 5000
B.P., and the well-established assignment of these points to a similar date in Nuevo
Leon, it appears that Catan points do not come only from a relatively late time period
in South Texas. The type may have a much longer time span than has been
previously thought or, alternatively, we may be dealing with two or more temporally
and/or culturally distinct types, which are, at least by current analytical standards,
morphologically indistinguishable. In either case, more information about the
chronological position(s) of the small, unstemmed, round-based dart point form in
southern Texas apparently is needed before the Catan type can be accepted as
chronologically diagnostic.

Environmental and Ecological Inferences
Both Rangia cuneata and Rangia flexuosa are brackish water clams, but
Rangiaflexuosa is known to prefer a higher salinity level than does Rangia cuneata
(Andrews 1977;220-221). Therefore the shift from 100 percent Rangiaflexuosa
in Zone III to a predominance ofRangia cuneata in Zone I suggests that a decrease
in salinity occurred in the estuarine waters near the site during the several millenia
between the occupations of the two zones. That this shift was gradual, reflecting
fundamental change in the estuary environment rather than relativly short term
oscillations in salinity levels, is suggested by the progressive shift in the proportional representation of the two species between successive 10-cm levels in the
excavations (Table 5). The percentages by level suggest that light and sporadic
occupations depositedRangia shell in the gradually accumulating loam soil of Zone
II, and that Rangia cuneata became increasingly well represented as aquatic
conditions became more suited to its requirements.
That such changes were not restricted to the area around the McKinzie site is
indicated by the following data from other sites along the southern margin of the
Nueces estuary.
1) The Means site (41NU184), several kilometers upstream from McKinzie,
can be described as a dense Rangiaflexuosa midden similar to McKinzie, Zone III.

RickIis n The McKinzie Site

43

All of the more-than-two-dozen projectile points recovered from the site, except for
a single Fresno arrowpoint, were Archaic dart points. There were no other Late
Prehistoric artifacts, such as potsherds. Excavations at this site revealed an apparent
aboriginal living surface that produced a crescentic post mold pattern in probable
association with a thin scatter of camp debris (Ricklis and Gunter 1986). Atthesame
level a cluster of Rangia flexuosa shells was uncovered. These shells were
submitted to the Radiocarbon Laboratory, Balcones Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin, and yielded a date of 5080+70 B.P. (Tx-5303-4390+70 B.P.
Callibration by dendrochronology, Klein 1984) (ibid.:25). So the profusion of
Rangia flexuosa at this site suggests an aquatic estuarine environment similar to and
at about the same time as that indicated at Zone III at McKinzie.
2) A shell stratum containing Rangia flexuosa exclusively was seen in an
exposed soil profile at the edge of an eroded wash at the Jackson Woods site
(42NU240), about 1 km upstream from McKinzie (R. Ricklis, field notes). The
stratum, 1 meter beneath the modem surface of a dark brown sandy clay-loam
topsoil, was about 10 cm thick. Eroding out of this stratum, together with several
chert flakes, was the medial section of a dart point, suggesting an Archaic
occupation. On the other hand, an exposed deposit of Late Prehistoric debris at this
site, which yielded chert flakes and Roc~rt ware pottery, had a scatter of Rangia
cuneata but no Rangia flexuosa.
3) At the Allison site (41NU185), halfa kilometer upstream from McKinzie,
test excavations yielded Late Prehistoric Rockport ware sherds in association with
Rangia cuneata (Carlson et al. 1983, Figures 15, 16).
So, though the data base ought to be expanded for greater certainty, Rangia
flexuosa deposits appear to correlate with relatively early occupations, whereas
Rangia cuneata is exclusively or predominantly in association with Late Prehistoric
material remains. The inference to be drawn from these data is that the changing
salinity in the Nueces estuary indicated by findings at the McKinzie excavation
happened throughout the area. This may appear to contradict the general paleoclimatic evidence that Texas (see Bryant and Halloway 1985) had increasingly dry
conditions during the Holocene, which would have resulted in progressively
reduced discharge of fresh water into coastal estuaries and a concomitant increase
in salinity levels. If the geological evidence is considered, however, a coherent
picture emerges that agrees with the archeological data. As already noted,
geological evidence indicates that by about 4500 B.P. the Nueces Valley was
inundated by Gulf waters at least as far inland as Calallen ~igure 1), about 8 km
west of the McKinzie site, creating a long embayment. At that time the high ground
on which the McKinzie site was situated would have been directly on the shore.
Since the present barrier islands had not formed, this embayment was susceptible
to tidal influence from the open Gulf, so general salinity levels would have be.en
high, decreasing toward more river-influenced areas near the head of the bay. With
the gradual formation of the barrier islands after about 2800 B.P. (Brown et al.
1976), the estuary would have become gradually less saline, until a habitat more
suited to the requirements ofRangia cuneata populations was established.
For these reasons it is postulated here that Zone III at McKinzie represents the

44

Texas Archeological Society

adaptation to an estuarine bayshore environment of aboriginal people by about 5000
B.P., with a varied subsistence base relying significantly on shellfish, primarily
Rangiaflexuosa clams, but also, to a minor extent, on oysters. The marine fish
otoliths in Zone III indicate that fall-winter fishing also played a role in their
subsistence economy. The importance of hunting is suggested by the fact that,
excluding debitage, dart points account for more than half of the lithic artifacts
recoverd. The complete absence of preserved bone in Zone III makes it impossible
to determine what species were hunted.
Zone II
Little can be said about Zone II. The sporadic and apparently random
occurrence of Rangia shell and occasional bits of unidentifiable bone suggests very
short term camping episodes that involved shellfish gathering and hunting activities. The sizeable and rather deep Feature 6-A, which had large amounts of ash and
burned soil, may have served as a roasting pit, but the absence of associated faunal
or floral remains makes further interpretation impossible.
Zone I
The artifact assemblage recovered from Zone I--Rockport ware pottery,
Perdiz arrowpoints, prismatic blades, and the small unifacial end scraper--is
characteristic of the Late Prehistoric Rockpert complex. These materials differ in
no significant way from those at many other sites in the Coastal Bend (cf. Campbell
1958b, Corbin 1963, Story 1968). Because of the controlled conditions of their
recovery, the findings from Zone I have the potential to reveal the nature of a single
Late Prehistoric occupation assignable to the Rockport complex.

Distributional Patterns
Though Zone I materials were found between 5 and 12 cm below the modern
ground surface, most specimens were found between 7 and 10 cm. All features-hearths, possible post molds, and the small pit--also came from the narrow range
of 7 to 10 cm. The contemporaneity of artifacts and features so implied is also
strongly supported by the horizontal distributions of features and debris.
Except for a dense cluster of debris in the northeastern part of the area A
excavation, most of the artifacts and bone fragments are clustered rather tightly
around the hearths, Features 4, 5, and 6 ffigure 12). In order to interpret this
distribution pattern, the densities of debris clusters in the excavated area were
examined. Three areas of debris clustering are suggested: (1) an area of moderate
density partially encircling the group of hearths, Features 4, 5, and 6, and contained
within a radius of about 1.5 to 2 meters to the northeast, east, and south of the hearths
where the average density of debris (sherds, chert debitage, and bone fragments)
is 27.I/square meter, (2) an area of high density in the northeastern part of the
excavation area where, except for very small splinters, there were no bone
fragments, and the density of sherds and debitage averages 48/square meter, and (3)
an area defined as all of the Zone I excavation outside of areas 1 and 2, where debris
is extremely sparse, averaging 5.3 specimens per square meter.

RickIis ~ The McKinzie Site

45

The presence of the moderately dense cluster around Features 4, 5, and 6
(Figure 26) is not believed to be fortuitous; it is probably debris accumulated during
daily activites around a central hearth complex. The location of the cluster to the
northeast, east, and south of the hearths is logical in the light of the fact that
prevailing winds during the spring, when the site was occupied, come from the eastsoutheast (Brown et al. 1976:29). Activities would have been concentrated on the
windward side of hearths.
In this light the area in the northeastern part of the excavation, which had
the highest density of debris, probably represents an episode of trash deposition.
The association of this debris with that around the hearths is certain, since the sherds
in both areas fall into the same groups--mostly Group 1--and all of the sherds in
Group 1 are from the same vessel.
This interpretation is further strengthened by the close correspondence in the
distribution of artifactual debris and Rangia cuneata fragments (Figures 20, 26).
The distribution pattern of Rangia (density per 1-meter unit) is a circle that
approximately duplicates, in both shape and location, the first of the artifactual
debris clusters described above. The 1-meter unit with the greatest density of
Rangia cuneata is also the unit with most sherds and debitage, a fact that further
supports the inference that the debris cluster in the northeast part of the excavation
is trash resulting from activites around the hearths.
Since the area around the hearths probably was a focal point of camp activity,
the area probably would have had a maintained surface, i.e., debris resulting from
various activities would have been deposited elsewhere. One area of deposition of
debris has been inferred; presumably there were others, since recovered potsherds
account for only small parts of the vessels from which they came. Also, the few
hundred pieces of chert debitage and the few bone fragments recovered probably
are only a fraction of the quantities of such debris that would be generated by an
occupation spanning all, or the better part, of a full season.
The inference that the debris that surrounds the hearths came from activities
that were performed inside a circular or semicircular structure is supported by
several findings:
1) Except for the cluster of relatively high density believed to result from trash
disposal, debris is distributed around the hearths in a circular pattern (Figure 26). It
will be noted that nearly all sherds, debitage, and bone fragments fall inside the
dashed circle, suggesting containment by a structure that minimized the natural
tendency for debris to be scattered by daily traffic.
2) Features 1,3,9,and 10 (Figure 26), possible post molds, are on or very near
the circle that marks the extent of debris around the hearths. Though every effort
was made during excavation to locate post molds, only these four seemed actually
to be post molds.
3) The small pit, Feature 8 (Figure 26), is just inside the circle. So, in
accordance with the postulation of structural containment, this feature represents a
pit located inside and near the wall of a structure. This placement of pits that served
as storage facilities in domiciles is well documented in a wide range of perhistoric
cultural contexts in North America.

4) The possible pits indicated by infrared photography form an alignment that
includes Feature 8 and closely follows the circular pattern (Figure 26). Also, the
consistent spacing of these possible pits and Feature 8 strongly suggests that the
spots visible in the photographs do indeed delineate a series of small pits just inside
a circular structural wall.
Taken together, these data strongly support the postulation of a circular or
semicircular hut about 5.5 meters in diameter with a central hearth complex. Such
a structure would be similar to the huts described for the historic aboriginal
inhabitants of the central Gulf Coast of Texas. Newcomb (1983:363) has described
the dwellings of the Karankawa as
constructed of a dozen or so slender willow poles approximately 18 feet long and
pointed at one or both ends. The sharpened ends were forced into the ground in a circle,
the upper ends interlaced and tied with thongs to form an oval framework over which
skins and woven rush mats were thrown. Often only the windward side was covered,
so it could as wellbe called a windbreak as ahut. The size of thehuts varied, butnormally
they were 10 or 12 feet in diameter and accommodated seven or eight people. They

could be dismantled quickly... Fires for cooking and for heat were built in the center of
the huts, the smoke easily finding its way out.

Functional Variability
Due to the temporary nature of the occupation and the apparent disposal of
debris outside the activity area on which the excavation was focused, the artifact
sample is small. Nevertheless, the material covers the range of daily activities
predictable for a seasonal multifunctional and residential occupation, as the
following list indicates.
1) Lithic tool production. The range of flake types covers all phases of tool
production, from primary cobble reduction to biface thinning. The most likely
source for lithic raw material is the gravel bed some 20 km up the Nueces River
(Chandler 1984). The presence of primary cortex flakes and the core indicates that
whole cobbles were brought to the site before initial reduction.
2) Plant processing. Two milling stone fragments (one from the Zone I
excavation) suggest that plants were being processed.
3) Storage. The one or more small pits that probably were inside a structure,
strongly suggests short-term storage, perhaps of gathered plants.
4) Various cutting and scraping tasks. The chert end scraper, twoRangia shell
scrapers, and several utilized flakes, all found in the debris cluster around the
hearths, indicate a variety of scraping and cutting activities.
5) Cooking. The dislribution of nearly all of the larger bone fragments and
sherds from what was probably a fairly large open-mouthed cooking pot (sherd
Group 1) around the hearths indicates that this area was a focal point for cooking and
eating.
Seasonality
As already discussed, analysis ofRangia cuneata valves indicates occupation
from about the middle of March through May. The close correspondence between
the distributions of Rangia cuneata shells and other debris, together with the

reasonably inferred association of these distributions with the features, strongly
suggests that the Zone I findings are the result of a single episode of occupation
during these months.
Ecological Considerations
The location of the McKinzie site is ecotonal, situated as it is between the
ecologically different zones of the Nueces estuary and the grassland prairie of the
higher ground to the south of the floodplain. Nevertheless, all indications are that
subsistence was oriented primarily to the terrestrial prairie environment. Relatively
little use seems to have been made of the aquatic food resources that must have been
available in the nearby estuary. In spite of reasonably good bone preservation in
Zone I, no fish bones were recovered, and, although it is recognized that fish bone
in general is susceptible to rapid decay, it would be reasonable to expect preservation of at least some vertebrae. Fish otoliths, on the other hand, resist decomposition
very well, yet only two otoliths were recovered from Zone I, and both may have been
redeposited from the disturbance that intruded into Zone III to the north of the
excavation. Meticulous examination of the surfaces on the site that produced Late
Prehistoric artifacts also failed to yield any signs of fish bones or otoliths. So it can
be stated with confidence that fishing was, at most, an insignificant subsistence
activity during the Late Prehistoric occupation of the site. It is possible that
procurement and consumption of fish was taking place at a fishing station away
from the site, which would account for the absence of fish remains, but this is only
a weak possibility because (1) the site itself is adjacent to the Nueces River, (2)
Rangia cuneata obviously were being gathered in the estuary and brought back to
the site for consumption, and (3) the excavated area was the focal point of various
daily activities and, as indicated by the mammal bone and inferred plant processing,
was an area to which food resources were brought to be processed and consumed.
Rangia clams in Zone I are in what can be described best as a scatter. The
excavation yielded I235 identifiable umbo fragments and whole valves, which
would account for half as many clams--not an impressive amount of food. Granting
that much of the Rangia debris generated by the occupation presumably was
deposited beyond the limits of the excavation, the scattering of Rangia seen in the
parts of the site that yielded Late Prehistoric material supports the inference that
Rangia was an occasional rather than a primary food resource.
The data indicate that the most significant subsistence pursuit was hunting. The
faunal remains indicate that small animals--turtles, birds, and frogs--were eaten,
but the greatest source of meat apparently was large game, specifically white-tailed
deer and bison. Though these two species are represented by only one individual
each, they account for several hundred pounds of meat, far more than the meat in
all other species in the faunal sample combined. The small number of bones in the
excavated area, though, suggests that (a) food was shared with people occupying
other parts of the site, (b) bones were left at kill sites or butchering areas, or (c) bones
were deposited in so-far-unexcavated trash areas.

Ricklis ~ The McKinzie Site

Synthesis
The points made above regarding the Zone I occupation can be synthesized as
follows. The cultural remains were left by a small group of people; perhaps the
group stayed at this location for all or for the better part of the spring season,
subsisting largely on hunted mammals, together with plants and small animals.
Plant processing may have been of some significance; the evidence at least suggests
that plant foods were being stored on a short-term basis for ongoing use. Despite
their proximity to estuarine resources, these people appear to have made little use
of aquatic species.
Daily activity was centered around a small hearth complex, probably in a
circular or semicircular shelter that was the focal point to which foods were brought,
processed, and eaten. Tools were made here and used in a variety of daily tasks. The
length of residence at this encampment, combined with the varied tasks performed
and the variety of resources procured and brought back to camp, indicate a
residential, multifunctional occupation. The people who abandoned the Zone I
remains followed a variety of subsistence pursuits and do not appear to have
concentrated their efforts on any single resource.
Parts of the site where disturbances have exposed Late Prehistoric deposits
apparently are similar to the excavated part of Zone I; light scatters of sandy paste
sherds, lithic debitage, Rangia shell, and occasional mammal bone are the rule.
Therefore, the kind of temporary focused activity area defined for the excavated
area probably characterized the Late Prehistoric occupation in other parts of the site.
Whether the unexcavated areas represent recurrent occupations at different times or
concurrent activities of other small groups within a single band cannot be determined from the available data.
How a seasonal occupation of the kind defined here might fit into the broader
pattern of settlement and subsistence in the Coastal Bend area during the Late
Prehistoric is examined below.
AN ECOLOGICAL MODEL OF LATE PREHISTO~C SETTLEMENT
AND SUBSISTENCE PATTERNS IN THE
CORPUS CHRISTI BAY AREA
Based on the data and analyses presented above, it is concluded that the Zone
I occupation at the McKinzie site was a seasonal residential and multifunctional
encampment in which subsistence was based primarily on the terrestrial grassland
environment. A study of settlement and subsistencepatterns for the Late Prehistoric
Rockport complex in the Corpus Christi Bay area establishes a cultural context for
the Zone I occupation. There are two basic questions: (1) is there any discemable
variability in the nature of Rockport complex sites that can be correlated with a
pattern of spatial distribution and, if so, (2) what implications might this have for
understanding the relationships among settlement pattern, subsistence strategy, and
social organization within the cultural system?
Examination of the existing information on 26 sites in the Corpus Christi area
(Figure 27) in the light of these questions raises further questions:
1) What are the relative densities of occupational debris on Rockport complex

50

Texas Archeological Society

z

Ricklis-- The McKinzie Site

51

sites, and, by inference, what was the intensity of occupation at each site?
2) What kinds of faunal remains predominate at each site?
3) Is there spatial patterning of sites with different densities of debris and
different kinds of faunal remains from which variation in settlement and subsistence
can be inferred?
From the data presented below, the following conclusions are suggested.
1) The most intensively occupied sites in the area, i.e., the sites with the highest
densities of cultural debris, are directly adjacent to the shores of bays and lagoons.
2) These intensively occupied sites are relatively few in number.
3) Marine faunal remains (fish and shellfish) are abundant in these shoreline
sites.
4) Sites with markedly lower densities of cultural debris are away from the
shorelines, along the streams feeding the Corpus Christi Bay system.
5) There are many more low-density sites than high-density shoreline sites.
6) The low-density sites yield relatively few marine faunal remains.
The Sites
Many of the more-than-350 sites in the area have yielded Late Prehistoric
materials, but useful information has come only from the sites described below.
Unless otherwise stated, the data are taken from site records on file at the Balcones
Research Center (TARL), The University of Texas at Austin.
For convenience and clarity, the sites have been divided into two groups, based
on the density of cultural debris. Group 1 sites, according to the files at TARL or
other sources (including the authorâs field observations), have yielded large quantities of cultural debris. Group 2 sites are sites for which the available information
indicates thin, low-density deposits. On these sites, artifactual finds are few, and
cultural debris in general (chert debitage, faunal remains) is thin and scattered. Sites
for which records were inconclusive on this point, and for which the quantities of
cultural remains could not be determined by field observations, were not considered, even though they were known to contain Late Prehistoric material. Therefore,
although there may be sites of intermediate density--neither very high nor clearly
low in the area, they are not included here because their density status could not
be determined.
Ideally, density of cultural debris should be quantified in terms of numbers of
artifacts and faunal specimens per unit volume of depositional matrix for each site.
This is possible in a few cases, but, since controlled excavations have not been made
at most sites, density must be evaluated by surface observation. Unless otherwise
stated, data have been obtained in this manner, but it is not as unreliable a procedure
as it might seem. Due to the semiarid climate, erosion has exposed significant parts
of many sites near streams and bays to such an extent that fairly useful observations
often can be made regarding the nature of cultural deposits. Clearly there is some
error inherent in this approach, but the differential distribution of high and low
density sites across the landscape that emerges from this inquiry indicates that we
are on the right track (Appendix Tables 3, 4).

52

Texas Archeological Society
Group 1 Sites

41NU1 (Webb Island Site)
This site was on an island (now destroyed) in Lagana Madre, very near the
mainland shore. The site has been known as a rich collecting ground for arrowpoints
since early in this century and has been referred to often as Arrowhead Island. The
site was tested in 1933 by A. T. Jackson, under the auspices of The University of
Texas. Jackson did not publish the results of his work, but the findings were
summarized by Campbell (1956). Jacksonâs notes, on file at TARL, are cursory but
indicate that much of the island was capped with a midden containing abundant
artifacts in association with conch (probably whelk) and oyster shell and abundant
fish bones. The site is described (Texas Archeological Research Laboratory files)
by a local collector as one of the densest kitchen middens in the area. Campbell
(1956), in his review of materials collected from the site, noted the presence of
mammal bone, including some specimens of what appeared to be bison bone.
The collection from the site, stored at TARL, includes several thousand sherds
of Rockport Plain and Rockport Black on Gray pottery, and in the lithic material
attributable to the Late Prehistoric are Perdiz (109), Bulbar Stemmed (13), Starr
(11), Fresno (10), Cliffton (5), Cameron (2), and McGloin (1) arrowpoints and 45
small unifacial end scrapers.
41NUll (Kirchmeyer Site)
This site is on a clay dune overlooking Oso Bay. Testing by T. R. Hester and
J. E. Corbin in 1969 revealed only a patchy distribution of concentrated debris (field
notes on file at TARL), but the site has yielded large quantities of surface-collected
Late Prehistoric artifacts that indicate fairly intensive use.
A sizeable collection from this site, housed at TARL, includes several thousand
sherds of Rockport Plain and Rock~rt Black on Gray pottery, 56 Perdiz, 28 Fresno,
8 Bulbar Stemmed, 7 Starr, 5 Guerrero, 4 Lozenge and 1 McGloin arrowpoint; and
18 small, unifacial end scrapers.
The testing by Hester and Corbin documented a rather wide range of faunal
remains, including marine species (whelk, oyster, sunray venus clam, and black
drum fish) as well as terrestrial mammals (deer, bison).
41NU219
This recently discovered site is adjacent to Laguna Madre at the north end of
Padre Island on the edge of Packery Channel, a tidal pass that probably connected
the Gulf of Mexico and Laguna Madre when the site was occupied. The site was
discovered during an archeological reconnaissance of the area by James E. Warren
(Texas Archeological Research Laboratory files).
Late Prehistoric cultural debris is found on the surface of the sandy soil for at
least 240 meters parallel to Packery Channel. A 1-meter test unit excavated under
Warrenâs direction yielded a large quantity of cultural debris, including several
hundred sherds of Rock~rt ware pottery, several hundred pieces of chert debitage,
a Perdiz arrowpoint, and abundant marine faunal material in the form of shell debris
and fish bones.
The author visited the site in the spring of 1985 and saw that the soil in the site

Ricklis ~ The McKinzie Site

53

area was markedly darker than that beyond the apparent limits of the site. Presumably this is the result of organic staining due to intensive aboriginal use of the
location.
41SP27
This site was on the top of the clay bluff overlooking the north shore of Corpus
Christi Bay. The site, now destroyed by recent residential expansion of the city of
Portland, was tested by Don Kindler, of Corpus Christi, shortly before its destruction (Kindler, personal communication). Kindler opened five 1-meter-square units
and found abundant Late Prehistoric material to a depth of at least 30 cm in an area
characterized by dense accumulations of oyster shell. Shell debris other than oyster
was notably scarce and consisted of only four whelk fragments and a single scallop
shell.
The author briefly examined the material recovered by Kindler and noted more
than 800 sherds of Rockport ware pottery, 448 pieces of chert debitage, 4 arrowpoints (3 Perdiz, 1 Fresno), 2 small unifacial end scrapers, several utilized flakes,
and 2 artificially perforated fish vertebrae that probably were beads.
Faunal remains collected by Kindler were 42 fragments of deer or deer-sized
bone, 6 turtle carapace fragments, and 15 rather large pieces of fish bone, including
2 black drum mandibles. The large size of the fish bones suggests that smaller bones
were present but not recovered.
41SPll (McGloin Bluff Site)
This site has been reported briefly by Corbin, who made surface examinations
there (Corbin 1963) and reported 3,381 sherds of Rockport ware pottery and several
stone artifacts. Among these artifacts are 18 arrowpoints (Perdiz, Bulbar Stemmed,
Starr, Young, and several untyped specimens), a small end scraper, 4 side scrapers
and a graver.
On visits in 1985, the author found an extensive site spread along the top of a
sand dune formation that parallels the Corpus Christi Bay shoreline for at least 400
meters. A borrow pit has intruded into the dune near the west end of the site, and
many potsherds were eroding out of the walls of this disturbance. Close examination of these walls, however, revealed no visible occupational midden, probably
because the dune had shifted since, and perhaps even during, the Late Prehistoric
occupation. On the other hand, recent erosion at the east end of the site has
revealed--buried under several feet of windblown, culturally sterile sand--a zone
at least 50 cm thick of dark-stained sand from which many artifacts have been
eroded and collected by LeAnne Weaver, of Corpus Christi (personal communication). The author examined this material briefly and noted, in addition to several
hundred sherds of Rockport ware, one Perdiz and one Start arrowpoint, a small
flaked drill, and many small flakes of chert.
The density of material at this site is difficult to evaluate with complete
confidence. Although artifacts, particularly potsherds, abound, much of the material seems to have been displaced by the shifting of the sand dune on which the site
is located. Faunal materials are scarce, but there is some bone, as well as many

54

Texas Archeological Society

fragments of poorly preserved whelk, oyster, scallop, and sunray venus shell. The
site is assigned to Group 1 on the basis of the abundance of artifacts recovered from
the surface.
41SP43/120
These sites, though assigned separate registration numbers, abut each other and
apparently are two parts of a continuous Late Prehistoric deposit along the sandy
loam bluff that borders Ingleside Cove, off Corpus Christi Bay. The exact extent
of these remains cannot be determined due to disturbances associated with modem
residential construction. The site is clearly extensive, however, as is indicated by
the sherds and other artifacts that are eroding out of several hundred meters of the
shoreline bluff. Site 41SP43 was tested by Dee Ann Story in 1967 (Story 1968).
Storyâs findings will not be reiterated here, except to emphasize that the excavations
revealed a Late Prehistoric Rock~ort complex component overlying earlier Archaic
material, and that characteristic Rockport material was associated with both
terrestrial mammal and large quantities of fish and shellfish remains (ibid.).
Some 100 meters south of 41SP43 is 41SP120, on a particularly intensively
occupied part of the Cove shoreline. This site was discovered in the fall of 1984 by
LeAnne Weaver and Skip Kennedy, of the Coastal Bend Archeological Society.
The site was first recognized as a discrete, densely packed shell midden directly
adjacent to the shoreline bluff. Testing revealed a seemingly fairly discrete, largely
nonshell midden area, some 15 meters south of the shell midden.
In order to determine the density, depth, and nature of the Late Prehistoric
remains at this site, a 1-meter test unit was excavated in the nonshell midden, under
the authorâs direction in December, 1985. Trowels were used, and control was in
arbitrary 5-cm levels. Due to time restrictions, this test unit was excavated only to
a depth of 55 cm. Late Prehistoric artifacts and a profusion of faunal remains, mostly
fish bone and small shell fragments, were found throughout the deposit 0~igure 28).
Except for a single Rockport Incised rim sherd (Suhm and Jelks 1962:134), all
of the 293 sherds from this test unit can be assigned to either the Rockport Plain or
Rockport Black on Gray types. Judging from the differences in thickness, color,
paste, and surface treatment, at least 20 vessels are represented.
Lithic artifacts consist of one Fresno arrowpoint and two narrow-stemmed
(probably Perdiz) arrowpoints with stems missing, together with a small end
scraper, two small bipointed chert drills, a trimmed prismatic blade, two utilized
flakes and 98 pieces of debitage.
Bone artifacts recovered are two tubular bird bone beads, an antler tine ground
to a point, and a modified deer ulna similar to others from south Texas referred to
as flaking tools (Corbin 1963:16, Hester 1980b: 120).
Shell artifacts consist of a perforated oyster shell and six edge-flaked sunray
venus clamshells.
More than 2,000 fragments of marine shell recovered represented, in order of
decreasing abundance, oyster, scallop, whelk, sunray venus, quahog, and crossbarred venus. Shell was far less abundant in this midden than in the nearby dense
shell midden mentioned above.

Figure 28. Test unit excavation in nonshell midden, 41SP120. Late Prehistoric materials
were found throughout this unit. Note scattering of shell debris.

Since all excavated soil was put through an 1/8-inch mesh in a water-screening
process, several thousand, mostly very small, fish bones were recovered. In
addition, 212 marine fish otoliths from black drum (23 %), croaker (28 percent), sea
trout (22 percent), redfish (19 percent), and catfish (8 percent) were collected.
Mammal remains were relatively few and comprised 31 fragments of deer and
deer-sized bone and 3 bovid bone fragemnts, presumably bison. Eleven fragments
of bird bone were found.
Microscopic examination of fish otolith cross sections for determination of
season of death showed that the annuli in only 79 of the 212 specimens were clear
enough to be useful indicators of seasonality. Many of the otoliths were too small
to have clear annual ring patterns, and it was found that croaker otoliths generally
did not have clear patterns (Table 9).

Since it is assumed that fish were caught as required during the siteâs occupancy, these data suggest a predominantly winter, or perhaps fall-winter occupation. Spring is very poorly represented. It is probably significant that drum enter
the shallowerparts of coastal bays in large numbers during the winter (Simmons and
Breuer 1962). The predictablepresenceoflargeaggregates ofblackdrum may have
been a major factor in the choice of this location. At the same time, the preponderance of winter death otoliths among the other species shows that these numbers indicate the season of occupation, rather than simply the seasonal abundance of drum.
It is significant that this seasonal representation persists throughout the
sampled deposit. Calculation of seasonality of the otoliths according to occurrence
by 10-cm depth increments produced the same results. Assuming that the deep,
dense deposit represents occupation over a considerable (though undefined) time
span, recurrent emphasis on winter or fall-winter occupation apparently continued
throughout that period.
Group 2 Sites
41NU33.
On the northeast bank of Oso Creek, about 9.5 km upstream from the head of
Oso Bay (Figure 27), scattered cultural debris includes small quantifies of pottery,
as well as Perdiz and Fresno arrowpoints (numbers not specified in files of TARL).
41NU36.
Near the crest of a clay dune on the west bank of Oso Creek (Figure 27). A small
intermittent stream flows just south of the site. During the summer and fall of 1980
a very thin scatter of cultural debris exposed by sheet erosion was seen. Scattered
burned clay nodules and scant marine shell debris (sunray venus and whelk) were
seen in an area about 20 meters in diameter. Twenty-three pieces of chert debitage,
four sherds of Rockport ware potter,/, and a reworked dart point were collected. It
is possible that this site has an Archaic component.
41NU37.
On the west bank of Oso Creek on a clay dune just south of 41NU36 (Figure
27). In 1980 and 1981, Late Prehistoric material was thinly scattered along the
eroded edge of the sandy loam topsoil capping the duneâs tan clay subsoil. This
material was found along a stretch of about 50 meters at the crest of the dune, where
it was clustered in two areas, each about 15 meters long. A similar scatter was
observed at the base of the dune, toward Oso Creek.
About five hours of meticulous surface collection resulted in the recovery of
107 small sherds of Rockport ware pottery, 2 Fresno arrowpoints, 1 small bipointed
chert drill, 1 small unifacial end scraper, 2 prismatic blades, 2 utilized flakes, 23
pieces of chert debitage, and 1 sandstone mano fragment.
During a survey by the Texas Archeological Survey ~atterson and Ford
1974:35), a Perdiz arrowpoint, a fractured mano fragment, and an unspecified
number of potsherds and chert flakes were found. Notes in files of TARL describe
this material as scanty.

Ricklis m The McKinzie Site

57

Faunal remains recovered from 41NU37 are five long bone fragments and one
rib fragment ofbovid bone (almost certainly bison,judging from the green fractures
and apparent association with Late Prehistoric material) and six pieces of deer bone.
Except for a few small fragments of sunray venus clamshell, no aquatic faunal
remains were noted.
41NU46.
On a clay dune on the east bank of Oso Creek (Figure 27), this site is primarily
a large Archaic midden. Late Prehistoric material is relatively sparse. According
to Jerry L. Bauman, of Corpus Christi, who has carefully documented a large
collection of Archaic material from the surface of eroded parts of the site, Late
Prehistoric material is found only sparsely and in only a small part of the east end
of the site (Jerry L.Bauman, personal communication). Over several years Bauman
recovered a few small sherds of Rockport ware pottery and Perdiz, Fresno, and S tarr
arrowpoints from this area.
41NU47.
Adjacent to the south bank of Oso Creek, about 4 km upstream from the head
of Oso Bay (Figure 27). Cultural material is sparse; the only diagnostic artifacts
reported are four sherds of Rockport ware. No information on faunal remains is
available.

41NU99.
In a cultivated field on the west bank of Oso Creek, about 11 km upstream from
the head of Oso Bay (Figure 27), reported by Patterson and Ford (1974:38). Surface
material was shallow and scattered. An unspecified number of chert flakes, one
sherd, and a fragmentary Perdiz arrowpoint were recovered. Faunal material
consisted of scattered unidentified marine shell and mammal bone fragments.
41NU105.
On the east bank of Oso Creek, about 7 km upstream from the head of Oso Bay
(Figure 27). The site was surveyed by Patterson, who describes debris as scattered
(Patterson and Ford 1974:40), consisting of chert debitage, two sherds, and a
scattering of marine shell and mammal bone.
41NU107.
On the north bank of Oso Creek some 3.5 km upstream from the head of Oso
Bay (Figure 27). The files at TARL indicate that cultural debris is sparse, consisting
of three sherds of Rockport ware pottery, a light scatter of mammal bone, chert
debitage, and unidentified marine shell.

41NU157.
On a low rise at the west end of a small, shallow pond called Tule Lake, 2 km
south of the present mouth of the Nueces River (Figure 27). In 1979, a thin scatter
of Rangia shell and chert debitage covered an area about 50 by 15 meters. In the

58

Texas Archeological Society

files of TARL, fragments of burned mammal bone and several sherds of Rockport
ware are recorded for this site.
41NU178.
On elevated ground next to a small intermittent stream that flows into the
Nueces River 10 km upstream from the head of Nueces Bay (Figure 27). As reported
in the files of TARL, artifacts consist of chert debitage, utilized flakes, a Perdiz
arrowpoint, and 20 sherds. Faunal remains consist of Rangia shell and a small
amount of oyster, whelk, sunray venus, and mammal bone (species not stated).
41NU179.
Reported in TARL files as a thinRangia shell accumulation on the same small
stream as 41NU178 (Figure 27). The recovery of dart points shows that the site has
an Archaic component, and a very light Late Prehistoric occupation is suggested by
the recovery of a single sherd and a possible Perdiz arrowpoint.

41NU185 (Allison Site).
On a hilltop adjacent to the Nueces floodplain, about 0.5 km upstream from the
McKinzie site, this site has been reported by Carlson, S teele, and Bruno (1983), who
describe tests carried out at the site by a crew from Texas A&M University.
Three 1-meter test squares were opened to depths of as much as 150 cm. Units
2 and 3, near the crest of the hill, yielded 39 small sherds of Rockport ware, mostly
within the upper 20 to 40 cm of the deposits. Also in the levels producing pottery
were 18 pieces of lithic debitage, a graver, and a biface fragment (Carlson, Steele,
and Bruno 1983 :Tables 2, 3, and 4). Rangia cuneata valves and fragments also were
scattered throughout these levels, and faunal materials from these levels consist of
the bones of a juvenile deer (believed to have been from a spring-summer kill), a
probably juvenile bison humerus shaft, and the left scapula of a cottontail. Also
recovered in one of these units was a drum fish otolith, though it is not specified
whether this was found in the pottery-bearing levels (Carlson, Steele, and Bruno
1983:63-67).
41NU193.
On the east bank of Oso Creek (Figure 27),this is a very low density scatter of
unidentified shell and burned clay nodules. Late Prehistoric artifacts are six Perdiz
arrowpoints, two Fresno arrowpoints, a small end scraper, and one sherd.
41NU221. (McKinzie Site)
All indications, already discussed in detail, are that the Late Prehistoric
occupation at the McKinzie site was light and temporary. Surface observations of
both the site and the excavations, revealed only thinly scattered Late Prehistoric
materials.

some 7 km upstream from the head of Nueces Bay (Figure 27), the site is in a
cultivated field and has been intensively surface-collected by Don Kindler, of
Corpus Christi (Kindler, personal communication). Most artifacts recovered are
Archaic forms. A very light Late Prehistoric occupation is indicated by two Perdiz
arrowpoints and three sherds of Rockport ware. While working at the McKinzie
site, the author visited this site briefly and noted a scatter of Rangia shell on the
surface of the plowed field. Most of the shell was Rangia flexuosa, probably
associated with the Archaic artifacts (see"Site-specific Interpretations," above). A
scatter ofRangia cuneata, however, may have been deposited by the Late Prehistoric occupants of the site. No other information on faunal remains is available.
41NU235
This site, discovered by the author during a surface reconnaissance in 1979, is
on a narrow elevated point between two old erosional cuts on the east bank of Oso
Creek (Figure 27). Extensive sheet erosion had exposed a scatter of burned clay
nodules and scanty lithic debitage in an area no more than 8 meters in diameter. Two
Fresno arrowpoints and a few small splinters of deer bone were found in this area.
41NU239
This site, now destroyed by sand-quarrying operations, was on the crest of a
hill overlooking the Nueces floodplain, near a small intermittent stream. In 1978,
shallow (10 to 15 cm deep) bulldozer blading had exposed a sparse but discrete
scatter of occupational debris about 10 meters in diameter. Careful examination of
the surface resulted in the recovery of two sherds of Rockport Plain pottery, a
fragmentary Perdiz arrowpoint, and 41 pieces of lithic debitage. A thin scatter of
Rangia shell was noted, and six small fragments of deer or deer-sized bone were
recovered.
41NU240 (Jackson Woods Site).
On a hill adjacent to the Nueces floodplain, 1 km upstream from the McKinzie
site. Patches of Rangia shell scatter can be seen in exposed areas over several acres
along the crest and north slope of the hill. At the crest of the hill, the convergence
of several shallow (10 cm deep) roadcuts has exposed what appears to be a discrete
scatter ofRangia cuneata shell some 25 meters long by about 8 to 10 meters wide.
Careful surface inspection of this part of the site in 1984 resulted in the recovery of
81 pieces of lithic debitage and 5 small Rockport Plain sherds from at least 3 vessels.
Besides Rangia cuneata, the only faunal remains noted were one bovid (bison?) rib
fragment and a splinter of bird bone. A careful search was made for fish remains,
but none were found.
A sample of 37 Rangia cuneata was gathered for seasonality analysis according
to the method developed by Aten (1981). The shells fell into the five analytical
categories (see discussion under "Faunal Remains, Zone Iâ3 as follows: interrupted
8 (22 percent), early 8 (22 percent), middle 12 (32 percent), late 4 (11 percent), and
indeterminate 5 (13 percent).
As with the McKinzie sample, these results do not fit well into any of the single

two-week growth histograms presented by Aten (see Aten 1981:187), suggesting
that the occupation at this site (which appears to be a discrete episode, judging by
the low density and spatial restriction of the debris) spanned several of the two -week
periods. The procedure described above of averaging the category percentages (less
the indeterminate category) for several two-week periods was applied, but with less
clear-cut results than were yielded by the McKinzie sample. The McKinzie sample
fell into category percentages for mid-March through end-May presented by Aten,
but the Jackson Woods category percentages did not conform closely with any of
the several averagings of two-week percentages. The closest fit that could be
obtained was with the average of the category percentages for the period from endMarch through end-June (Table 10).

These data indicate a spring-early summer occupation. Why the results do not
conform better to Atenâs percentages cannot be determined, though several explanations are possible: 1) The Jackson Woods sample may be biased by (a) the
presence of shells from more than one occupational episode or by (b) emphasis on
Rangia gathering during a particular period within an occupational episode; 2)
Unusual temperature patterns during the time of site occupation may have skewed
the growth ring patterns on theRangia shells, or 3) The sample may be too small for
a high degree of analytical accuracy.
41SP103.
A small site on the clay bluff that overlooks the north shore of Corpus Christi
Bay, close to a small stream that flows into the Bay. When the site was visited in
1979, it had already been partially lost to landward erosion of the bluff, and it was
recently destroyed by residential development. Examination of the naturally
created soil profile along the bluff indicated that Late Prehistoric material was
eroding out of a thin (2 to 5 cm) zone of soil 5 tol 0 cm below modern ground surface.
This occupational zone could be traced along the bluff for about 10 meters.
Material recovered during several visits to the site includes 103 sherds (mostly
very small) of Rockport pottery, 384 pieces of chert debitage, 2 Perdiz arrowpoints,
4 small unifacial end scrapers, and 3 utilized flakes.
Marine faunal material was surprisingly scarce (considering the siteâs shoreline location) and consisted of a few small fragments of whelk and oyster, as well
as a single stingray spine. Bone material includes three bovid (presumably bison)

long bone fragments, eighteen deer and deer-sized fragments, and five splinters of
bird long bone.
Discussion
The information from the sites described above (Appendix, Table 3) indicates
that intensively occupied locations are found only in marine shore environments:
All sites with large samples of artifacts and relatively deep midden deposits are on
bay or lagoon shores. The information also indicates that all sites away from the
shorelines in riverine environments have only scattered cultural material, a conclusion that agrees with an observation by Steele and Mokry (1985:305) on the
scattered nature of site deposits along Oso Creek. Artifacts are few from these
slightly inland sites; even the sites in Group 2 that have yielded more than a few Late
Prehistoric artifacts have done so only because of rather intensive surface inspection (such as 41NU37 and 41S P 103 ) or excavation involving more than very limited
testing, as at McKinzie. On the other hand, the very limited testings at Group 1 sites,
as at 41NU219, 41SP27, and 41SP120, have yielded hundreds of diagnostic Late
Prehistoric, mainly ceramic, artifacts.
The data surveyed here also indicate that Group 1 sites are few, and Group 2
sites are relatively numerous.
Intensively occupied shoreline sites, according to the available information,
tend to yield large quantities of marine faunal remains, however, there does appear
to be variability in the density and nature of such remains. It is apparent, for
example, that fish and shellfish remains are not as abundant at sites 41NU11 and
41SP11 as they are at41SP43/120, 41NU1, and 41NU219. At41SP11, this may be
a factor of the general dispersal of remains in a shifting sand dune, whereas 41NU11,
which yielded a patchy concentration of debris, probably was not occupied as
intensively as were the other sites in Group 1.
Nevertheless, as a group, these sites can be distinguished readily from Group
2 sites, on which neither artifacts nor marine and/or estuarine faunal remains are
abundant. Many of the sites have shellfish scatters, which probably reflect minor
contributions of molluscs to the diets of their occupants. Recent studies have
suggested that even large quantities of shellfish were only of supplementary
significance in hunter-gatherer diets (e.g. Bailey 1978; Parmalee and Klippe11974).
Bailey, for example, has estimated that more than 57,000 oysters would be required
to provide the caloric and protein equivalent of a single European red deer (Bailey
1978:39), and Aten has estimated that the 680 Rangia cuneata clams at site
41CH170 on the Upper Texas Coast represent sufficient food for only one or two
meals for a group of four to six adults (see discussion in Aten 1983b: 13-16).
Group 2 sites appear to yield few if any fish remains. Many of the sites have
yielded inadequate data on this point, but the Group 2 sites examined by the author
(41NU36, 41NU37, 41NU221,41NU239, 41NU240, and 41SP103) have yielded
few or no fish remains. Much the same can be said for the Allison site (41NU185),
where only a single fish otolith was reported from test units bearing Late Prehistoric
artifacts (Carlson et al. 1983).
Since all of the sites, except for a few from which no faunal information is

62

Texas Areheological Society

available, have yielded at least some mammal remains, it is apparent that land
species were hunted regardless of location or intensity of occupation. The poor
representation of aquatic species on Group 2 sites suggests, however, that, proportionately, terrestrial mammals were of considerably greater significance at these
sites than at the shoreline Group 1 sites. This is in accord with the conclusions
already stated for the McKinzie site, the only Group 2 site from which there is a
substantial body of excavated data.
So the differential distribution of intensively occupied shoreline sites as
opposed to much less intensively occupied riverine sites can be correlated with
differences in relative quantities of marine as opposed to land faunal remains. This
has significance for the generation of a model of settlement and subsistence patterns,
which is discussed from a cultural-ecological perspective below.

The Model
It should come as no surprise that shoreline locations in this study area have
yielded evidence of intensive aboriginal occupation. The shallow bays and lagoons
between the mainland and the barrier islands of Texas produce a variety offish and
shellfish that are obtained easily with the simple technology of the inhabitants of the
area.
We have seen, however, that Late Prehistoric sites in the area vary considerably
both in the intensity of occupation and in the kinds of faunal species present. A
correlated spatial pattem appears to be involved, with the relativity few intensively
occupied sites only on marine shorelines, and the many lightly occupied sites inland
along stream courses.
What significance does this distributional pattern have for Late Prehistoric
settlement and subsistence patterns? Emerging clearly is the fact that certain
shoreline locations were focal points of settlement and subsistence activities and
that inland locations saw less intensive, more dispersed occupation. This is
ecologically significant, since all of the Group 1 sites are along shallow marine
waters containing concentrated and predictable marine resources. These resources
were not evenly available to the inhabitants at their respective levels of technological development. Shellfish would have been obtainable only in shallow and
generally quiet waters. Fish could have been taken in large quantities with nets and
fish traps, but, again, only in the shallower parts of the bays and lagoons. So the
Group 1 sites were ideally located in relation to these limitations.
It has been postulated by various authors that hunter-gatherer settlement will
generally increase in both intensity and size with a corresponding increase in the
concentration and predictability of food resources in a heterogeneous resource
mosaic (Butzer 1982:230-43, Hassan 1981:180, Jochim 1981:148-63). This point
has been discussed at some length, specifically for hunter-gatherer adaptation in
highly productive coastal environments. The high level of concentration and
predictability of marine resources at favorable locations is suggested to have been
conducive to a corresponding focus and intensity of human settlement ~earlman
1980, Yesner 1980, Rowley-Conwy 1983), and, for this reason, population aggregations such as Group 1 sites may have occurred at optimal coastal locations. This

RicklisD The McKinzie Site

63

may be viewed as both an opportunistic response and as a necessary precondition
for the successful extraction of large quantities of small-sized species.
The Group 1 sites are, then, ecologically predictable. The socio-cultural
implications here offer a potentially fruitful line of inquiry. If Group 1 sites do in
fact represent population aggregations, they probably were focal points for social
interaction beyond the minimal band level (The term minimum band is used here
to refer to the smallest population group thought to have been necessary for the
effective functioning of a hunter-gather adaptive system; see Hassan 1981:180-186,
Lee and DeVore 1968, Wobst 1974:170). A systemic linkage among subsistence,
settlement, and social organization strategies is likely. As favorable resource
availability enables minimal band groups to coalesce periodically into larger
groups, the opportunities for exchange of information, establishment and maintenanceofmating networks, and the performance of rituals and ceremonies that affirm
social and ideological ties beyond the minimal band level are both possible and
necessary (Wobst 1974, Hassan 1981:180-186).
Therefore it is postulated here that, within the Late Prehistoric settlement
patterns, Group 1 sites were base camps that served as focal points for relatively
large group aggregates and concomitant socio-cultural elaboration beyond the
minimal band level. However, although there can be no doubt that these locations
saw relatively intensive occupation, there are no archeological data available for
relatively large resident populations, so they simply could have seen more frequent
use by small bands than did locations less rich in resources. However, some
ethnohistorical and human biological evidences support the inference of population
aggregates.
Newcomb (1983:364) has suggested sizeable group aggregates, perhaps as
many as 350 to 500 people, among the early historic Karankawans of the region,
based on extrapolations from accounts of contemporary observers who reported
large groups of warriors. The 1720 account of the French navigator Jean Beranger
describes a shoreline encampment of some 500 people near Aransas Pass on the
northern edge of this study area (Beranger 1983). This observation, made during
the fall season, also refers to circular huts used (apparently by the same group) for
storage of fish, which suggests that large quantities of fish were caught and stored
for the support of a sizable population.
Research completed recently by Jackson, Boone, and Henneberg (1986)
suggested population aggregation during the Late Archaic. Sixty-eight skeletons
from a large cemetery site on Oso Bay (41NU2, excavated by A. T. Jackson for The
University of Texas in the 1930s) were studied. At least 24 percent of the individuals
suffered from what may have been endemic treponematosis, a disease that is likely
to be transmitted to such a high percentage of the population only under circumstances of at least part-time population aggregation. So the large groups postulated
here for the Late Prehistoric probably were already in the area during the Late
Archaic.
If Group 1 sites are seen to represent base camps with population aggregates
made possible by concentrated and predictable resources, how can we view the role
of the more numerous Group 2 sites? Two possible functions are suggested.

64

Texas Archeological Society

First, they may be short term, function specific sites that were locations for the
procurement of specific resources not readily available in the shoreline base camps.
Aggregate populations might easily exhaust important terrestrial resources (such as
deer, for example) if, as is indicated by substantial accumulations of debris, these
locations were occupied over considerable periods of time. Group 2 sites would
have served as intermediate procurement stations between the resources of the
interior and the consumer populations in the shoreline base camps that were more
or less permanent residences for relatively large groups, from which specialized
task groups made repeated forays. Smith (n.d.) has postulated such a permanent
base camp function for the large Late Prehistoric component at site 41KL13 on
Baffin Bay. The evidence at 41KL13, however, may preclude an interpretation of
year-round permanence, since black drum otoliths comprise the "overwhelming
majority" of fish otoliths collected, and, of the drum otoliths, 70 percent are from
winter fish kills and only 2 percent from summer kills (see Smith 1983:499).
A second interpretation of Group 2 sites--the one favored here--is that these
sites were not task-specific in function, but rather were the residences of small
groups that periodically spread out from base camps that were only recurrently
occupied in a seasonally oscillating settlement and subsistence strategy. The data
from the McKinzie site have strongly suggested this kind of occupation--a
residential, multifunctional seasonal camp. In this perspective, Group 2 sites were
the encampments of small groups who practiced a range of subsistence pursuits.
So both shoreline base camps and smaller seasonal camps were focal points for
the exploitation of different segments of the adaptive niche. The abundance of
marine resources, augmented by the influx into shallow bay/lagoon waters of large
quantities of drum fish, allowed the coalescence of significant band aggregates
during the fall-winter season. With the scattering of concentrations of drum
populations in the spring, the least risk response of the inhabitants of the area was
population dispersal. Although some groups may have remained at the temporarily
less productive shoreline locations, other groups moved into the riverine zones,
presumably attracted by game and plant resources.
At this writing, we have data on seasonality from only three sites in the Corpus
Christi Bay area. Clearly, much more information of this kind is needed, but it is
perhaps significant that the data we have are complementary rather than contradictory. Seasonality analysis offish otoliths indicates that at the Group 1 site 41SP120
the heaviest occupation apparently was during the fall-winter period. This is in
accord with the response postulated here to particularly abundant winter fish
resources. On the other hand, the analyses of theRangia cuneata samples from the
McKinzie and Jackson Woods sites (Group 2 sites) indicate spring and spring and
early summer occupations respectively--just the times of the year most poorly
represented by the otoliths from 41SP120. So the data, although limited, suggest
a seasonal cycle involving winter or fall-winter marine-oriented base camps and
spring-summer dispersal into smaller groups.
A relevant observation was made by Cabeza de Vaca. Though it pertains to his
Capoques and Han groups, who probably lived to the north of this study area around
the western end of Galveston Island (Newcomb 1983:361), the seasonal subsistence

Ricklis ~ The McKinzie Site

65

strategy is similar to the strategy suggested here.
From October through February every year, which is the season these Indians live on the
Island, they subsist on the roots I have mentioned, which the women get from under the
water in November and December. Only in these two months, too, do they take fish in
the cane weirs. When the fish is consumed, the roots furnish the staple. At the end of
February, the islanders go to other parts to seek sustenance, for the root is beginning to
grow and is not edible [Covey 1983:61].
Though Cabeza de Vaca seems to have been particularly impressed with the
importance of the roots, the mention of weirs suggests that fish were being taken in
sufficiently large quantities to be a significant factor in supporting a fall-winter
shoreline occupation.
It can be pointed out here, incidentally, that a comparison of the seasonal
breakdowns, presented above, of the fish otolith analyses from 41SP120 with those
from the Zone III Archaic component at McKinzie, which dates to about 5000 B.P.,
shows that they have virtually identical patterns of seasonality. So it is possible that
the McKinzie Zone III occupation falls into a long-lived pattern of fall-winter
emphasis on bayshore resource exploitation that had been established by the midHolocene, a possibility that fits in with Corbinâs suggestion (1976) of continuity in
adaptive patterns from the Archaic through the Late Prehistoric. Future research
might well focus on the question of continuity in adaptive patterns in the region from
the mid-Holocene to and through the Late Prehistoric [see Prewitt and Paine, herein
Editor].
Two groups of sites have been suggested here, but it is likely that there is in the
archeological record a third group that represents short term procurement camps the
temporal and spatial patterns of resource availability. The model posits a hierarchy
of archeological sites falling into two and, predictably, three groupings, each
reflecting differences in intensity of occupation, group size, and resource procurement. It is suggested that whereas the overall adaptation that characterized the
Rockport complex was strongly oriented toward marine resources, settlement and
subsistence activities oscillated seasonally between intensive use of shoreline zones
and a more dispersed pattern of exploitation of terrestrial resources.
that served specific functions. These will be difficult to recognize in the field, since
cultural debris is likely to be extremely sparse. Such sites, if found, would comprise
debris from short term hunting and/or plant-gathering activities by small groups
within the catchments of Group 1 and Group 2 sites. It is entirely possible that some
of the sites considered here Group 2 are in fact such function-specific sites, but
without excavation it would be very difficult to make such a distinction.
In summary, the model (Figure 29) proposed here is an ecological one, with
settlement pattern inextricably linked to subsistence strategy and the temporal and
Testing the Model
The following lines of research should be undertaken as tests of the proposed
model:
1. Quantification of site densities. Most of the site data reported here come
from surface observations, so controlled testing should be undertaken to quantify
the densities of artifacts and faunal remains per unit volume of deposit. Such a

procedure would either put the present hypothesis on a firm footing or indicate the
need for revision of the model.
2. Determination of site seasonality. An oscillating pattern of seasonal settlement is postulated here on the basis of data from three sites; expansion of this small
data base would help in evaluating these inferences. A surge in research in recent
years has opened several lines of inquiry for determination ofseasonality, involving
the remains of fish (Casteel 1976, Monks 1981), shellfish (Aten 1981, Quitmeyer
et al. 1985), and mammals (Monks 1981). The use of as many seasonal indicators
as possible from a given site would insure the determination of the season(s) of
actual occupation and not simply the seasonal availability of specific kinds of
resources.

Ricklis ~ The McKinzie Site

3. Definition of intrasite pattems. At present the McKinzie site data provide
the only details of spatial patterns in a Late Prehistoric site in the study area. In order
to evaluate the postulation of both large base camps and camps occupied by small
groups, data are needed on spatial arrangements at other sites in the area.
Taken together, this model and the procedures suggested for testing it can serve
as a basis for a systematic approach to the Late Prehistoric stage in the cenlxal part
of the Texas coast. With expansion of the data base, the model would be either
strengthened or revised in accordance with the new data. Ultimately, these
procedures will make it possible to pursue a productive line of inquiry into the
interrelationships among patterns of settlement, economy, and social organization
in an adaptation by hunter-gatherers to a resource-rich coastal environment.
