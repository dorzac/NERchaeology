ABSTRACT
A preliminary araheologiaal survey of two prospeative
lignite strip mining areas in Robertson County, Texas, was
aarried out by the Texas Araheologiaal Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, for Phillips Coal Company.
Approximately 12 peraent of the ?5,000 aare projeat area was
seleated as a random, predictive sample designed to loaate
cultural resouraes.
Pedestrian survey of the seleated
transeats yielded sixty-four aboriginal sites, forty in
the Calvert Prospect and twenty-four in the _Cole Creek
Prospeat.
Virtually all the sites were loaated in lowland
areas near the major drainages.
Although only eleven sites
yielded time-diagnostia artifaats, the time span of the
oaaupation whiah these suggest inaludes the Paleoindian,
Middle and Late Arahaia and Late Prehistoria periods.
Reaommendations for further survey and testing of the
prospeat areas are presented.

INTRODUCTION
During the period from June through August, 1978, the
Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at Austin,
conducted a preliminary assessment of the cultural resources
of two lignite prospects in northern Robertson County, Texas,
for Phillips Coal Company. The Calvert Prospect encompasses
an area of approximately 30,000 acres west and northwest of
the town of Calvert; the Cole Creek Prospect is a narrow
47,000 acre strip of land extending from the Brazos River
south of Calvert northeast to the Navasota River northeast
of the hamlet of Bald Prairie (Fig. 1).
An archival and literature search and an intensive field
survey of randomly selected transects were implemented as
part of an environmental assessment of both prospects. This
study was designed to provide the sponsoring agency, Phillips
Coal Company, with a planning guide for the development of
future mining operations. The specific goals of the study,
as outlined at its inception, were:
l} to conduct a comprehensive search of records and
literature to precisely locate and evaluate the present
condition of any known prehistoric or historic cultural
resources within the project areas;
2} to conduct an intensive field survey designed to
obtain a random sample of each major ecological and

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

physiographic zone from which predictions of probable locations of historic and prehistoric sites could be made;
3) to evaluate the significance of the discovered
resources in terms of their scientific contributions to the
understanding and interpretation of the cultures represented;
and
4) to develop a series of recommendations for further
research in the Calvert and Cole Creek prospects; specifically, for the implementation of an intensive field survey.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Robertson County is included in Fenneman's (1938: 108109) West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province and is
marked by gently rolling hills and ridges which rarely
exceed 500 feet in elevation. There is greater relief
toward the Navasota River, but the landforms of both survey
areas are essentially the same; hills broken by occasional
ridgelines and by the floodplains of the Brazos and Navasota
rivers and their tributaries (Figs. 2, 3).
CLIMATE
Robertson County lies on the western margin of the
East Texas climatic region. Average annual rainfall is
36-38 inches, and average annual temperature is 66-69° F.
The area is currently characterized by precipitation maxima
in May and December and the minimum in August, producing
a summer drought pattern. However, fluctuations of up to
20 percent from the normal precipitation occur so frequently
that such variation may be considered normal (Carr 1967: 4-8,
10, 19).
GEOLOGY
Geologically, the area is considered a part of the Gulf
Coast Tertiary province and is underlain by formations of
the Wilcox Group which are comprised of Eocene sediments of
fluvial origin (Henry 1976: 8). Surface sediments and outcrops in the survey areas include Holocene alluviums of the
river systems; Pleistocene terrace deposits on the mainstem
Brazos and Navasota; and the Simsboro and Calvert Bluff
formations (Wilcox Group), the Recklaw Formation and the
Carrizo Sand, all of Eocene age. The Simsboro Formation
is a source of a potential aboriginal resource, kaolinitic

clays. which outcrop at several localities in northern
Robertson County (Fisher 1965: 37).
HYDROLOGY
The sands of the Wilcox Group and the overlying Carrizo
Sand constitute a major aquifer which discharges through
seeps and springs in the survey area, resulting in at least
some streams which are generally effluent throughout the
year.
The Calvert and Cole Creek prospects lie between the
Brazos and Navasota rivers. The Calvert Prospect and the
western edge of the Cole Creek area are drained by the
Brazos and its tributaries, the Little Brazos River and
Mud and Walnut creeks. The bulk of the Cole Creek Prospect
is within the drainage basin of the Navasota River and the
tributary Bear, Duck, Mulberry, Mineral and Steele creeks.
SOILS
In the floodplains of the Brazos and Navasota rivers,
the soils are Holocene alluvium derived from the Black
Land Prairies to the north and west. In the upland areas,
the soils are derived from the older sedimentary sequences.
According to the General Soil Map, Robertson County, the
predominant terrace and upland soils are the Axtell-Tabor
and Wilson-Burleson series. with fine clayey to fine sandy
loam surfaces.
Calvert Prospect
The lowland soils, which make up almost half of the
Calvert Prospect, are the acidic Nahatche-Thenas clay to
fine sand loams along Walnut Creek, and the calcareous
clay and silty clay loam Ships-Weswood series in the
bottomlands of the Brazos River. These soils, which previously supported mixed hardwood forests, have been under
intensive cultivation for the last one hundred years. As
a result, aboriginal and early historic sites in these
floodplain croplands are readily observable, but have been
heavily disturbed by deep plowing.
Cole Creek Prospect
By far the predominant soil series in the Cole Creek
Prospect are the Demona-Padina loamy sands and the AxtellTabor fine sandy loams, both of which are upland soils.
More localized are the Ships-Weswood bottomland soils
along the Brazos River, the Nahatche-Thenas acidic creek

soils along the Little Brazos River and Mud, Duck and Mineral
creeks, and the Kaufman-Gladewater series of clayey river
soils along Steele Creek and the Navasota River. Although
the upland soils are used for agricultural purposes in parts
of the prospect, they are better suited for pasture, and
are frequently planted in non-native grasses such as coastal
Bermuda and lovegrass. In certain parts of the Cole Creek
Prospect, detrimental agricultural practices such as overgrazing have resulted in deflation of hilltop sediments and
in extensive gullying. While other-factors are certainly
involved, these erosional phenomena may well have contributed to the much lower site frequencies observed there
compared to the Calvert Prospect.
FLORA AND FAUNA
Botanically, the prospects fall within the Post Oak
Savannah of the East Texas Timberlands, a zone transitional
between the Blackland Prairies to the west and the Pine
Belt of East Texas Timberlands to the east.
Grasses include the little bluestem, Indian
grass, switch grass, purpletop, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, and species of
·Uniola. The overstory is postoak (Queraus
stellata) and blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandiaa), with a few varieties of
other hardwoods, such as gum hickory,
cypress, elm, ash, maple, and cottonwood.
Brush and weedy species also are common.
(Fisher 1965: 11).
In addition, a number of other species were observed during
the survey which would have been of importance to aboriginal
hunters and gatherers. These include native walnut and
pecan (particularly abundant in the Navasota bottoms), bois
d 1 arc or Osage Orange, extensive stands of yaupon which
serve as forage for deer, and cattail (Typha sp.), the
leaves of which can be used for mats and basketry and the
tuberous roots of which are edible. Occasional, and in
some places extensive, cedar brakes served as a source of
building materials for European settlers who preferentially
selected this wood for pilings and log structures.
Both prospects fall within Blair's (1950: 100-102)
Texan Biotic Province which, from a faunal standpoint,
represents the transition from eastern woodland to western
prairie fauna. Some forty-nine species of mammals, as
well as a number of species of birds, reptiles and amphibians, currently inhabit the Texan Province. Many of these

Variation in Ground Cover

Land use and type of vegetation cover have the
greatest influence in determining surface visibility,
and hence, site recognition. Manmade and natural
ground disturbances including plowed fields and
animal burrows provide excellent surface visibility,
and often expose site refuse. The type and density
or lushness of vegetative cover can also be critical
in obscuring ground surface visibility. This plate
illustrates typical ground cover in the Calvert and
Cole Creek prospects.

animals could have been utilized by aboriginal peoples for
food, furs and other raw material. The fish, turtles,
rabbits, squirrels and white-tailed deer which are still
plentiful in the area would have been of primary importance.
The flora and fauna of this part of Cent~al Texas have,
of course, undergone modification. Bryant's'c (1969: 104130) pollen analyses of Boriak, Hershop and South Soefje
bogs indicate that there was a cooler, wetter climate during
the Pleistocene late Full-Glacial, when a deciduous open
woodland, including spruce and maple, covered Central Texas.
By the end of the Pleistocene, this climate and vegetative
pattern had begun to change:
What is instead revealed is a fossil record
showing a gradual, yet continual, trend
towards a more xeric climate. The fossil
pollen record also implies that the present
widespread area of post oak savanna vegetation in central Texas (Gould 1975) was
probably more or less established in its
present form and distribution by 3,000
years ago (Bryant and Sha fer 1977: 18}.
This gradual post-Pleistocene change is reflected in the
Jaunal record by the extinction of some large Pleistocene
animals, and the loss of smaller forms currently found in
cooler climates (Lundelius 1967). By the end of the Pleistocene, the faunal inventory of Central Texas was essentially
modern, with the exception of the armadillo and javelina,
which entered the region within the last few centuries
(Lundelius 1967: 313). Published faunal records from sites
in Central Texas reflect the modern fauna except at the
Levi Site which dates from about 10,000 B.P. (Alexander
1963: 513). At Levi, extinct Pleistocene forms were present,
but apparently did not form the basis of the inhabitant's
economy. At later sites, the fauna represented is essentially modern (Johnson 1962: 75).
In summary, the flora and fauna of Central Texas underwent a gradual transition in post-Pleistocene times, probably in response to the trend towards a warmer and drier
climate, and reached their modern composition by at least
3,000 B.P. Fluctuations have certainly occurred, and have
been documented by correlation with changes in the bison
range in Texas from 10,000 B.C. to historic times (Dillehay
1974). While the presence or absence of this large game
animal would certainly have influenced the economies of
local aboriginal groups, a basic subsistence hunting and
gathering strategy dependent upon the modern flora and
fauna has existed in Central Texas for the past 10,000
years.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The history of organized archeological research in
Robertson County, prior to the present survey, is brief.
Only fifteen prehistoric sites had been recorded in the
county; fourteen of these were located in 1974, during
surveys conducted by the Texas Archeological Survey for
the Upper Navasota Reservoir (Prewitt 1974) and the Twin
Oak Project (Prewitt and Grombacher 1974). All of these
sites are in the extreme northeastern corner of the county
in the drainage of the Navasota River. The same surveys
located an additional sixty-two sites in adjacent Leon and
Limestone counties.
Earlier investigations in Central Texas were concentrated to the north of the project area, along the Brazos
River in Hill and Mclennan counties, and to the west, on
and around the Edwards Plateau in Coryell, Bell, Williamson,
Travis, Burnet, San Saba, Llano and Gillespie counties
(Suhm 1958: 89-103; Johnson 1967: 18-22). From these
studies a relative chronology, based on the Paleoindian/
Archaic/Late Prehistoric/Hi~toric stage framework, is
gradually becoming refined.
THE PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The Paleoindian period began prior to 10,000 B.P. and
continued to approximately 8,000 B.P. It has typically
been defined by the exploitation of Pleistocene mega-fauna
and is considered to con~lude with the post-Pleistocene
extinction of these animals.
The projectile points generally associated with this
stage (Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff, Plainview, Meserve, San
Patrice, Angostura) are typical surface finds in Central
Texas, but in situ discoveries from the Paleoindian period
have been limited to a few sites such as Levi Rockshelter
(Alexander 1963), the Loeve Site (Eddy 1973; Prewitt n.d.),
Tombstone Bluff (Prewitt 1974, n.d.) and 41BX52 (Henderson
n.d.). In order to find sites with Paleoindian material
in direct association with extinct Pleistocene fauna, it
is necessary to examine evidence from other parts of Texas
(Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Johnson 1974). The absence of
direct evidence of the Pleistocene species at many Paleoindian sites has led some researchers (Alexander 1963;
Shafer 1977; Bryant and Shafer 1977) to suggest that the
subsistence pattern in Central Texas was not based strictly
upon the exploitation of mega-fauna, but upon a more generalized assemblage of large and small game, and plants.

16

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

Individual diagnostic artifacts which appear to represent a Paleoindian industry have frequently been found at
sites which otherwise suggest an Archaic affiliation. These
isolated finds could represent a limited use of older forms
by transitional or early Archaic people. They might also
indicate the temporary presence of Paleoindians entering
Central Texas from the southern Plains, perhaps in pursuit
of the bison which, as Dillehay (1974) has indicated, were
present in Central Texas between 12,000 and 7,000 B.P.
THE ARCHAIC PERIOD
The best documented period in Central Texas prehistory
is the Archaic, during which semisedentary people maintained
a subsistence economy based primarily on deer, small game
and wild plant foods (Johnson 1967: 75-76). Agriculture
and ceramics appeared during the very late, transitional
part of the Archaic, if at all.
The Archaic inhabitants of Central Texas had a wide
variety of food items and habitats available to them. It
appears likely that they followed a seasonal round within
a limited territory, returning to the same habitation sites
through the years. Johnson (1967) has suggested that the
profusion of artifact types in the Central Texas Archaic,
and the lack of artifact continuity over time, may be the
result of their use for different economic functions in a
multifarious environment.
The Archaic in Central Texas has been divided into
two cultural units, the Central Texas Archaic and the La
Harpe Aspect. The latter includes sites from the Brazos
River eastward into western Louisiana and northward to the
plains of central Oklahoma. Johnson (1962: 143-144) describes the La Harpe Aspect as a culture, or group of related
cultures, which experienced a uniform historic development
throughout the Archaic period. Important or diagnostic
factors in that development included an early phase of
expanding stem dart points followed by a change to contracting stems, and the still later appearance of plainware ceramics. The La Harpe Aspect is thus considered to
terminate with the introduction of the bow and arrow and
the development of decorated pottery.
Prewitt (1975) and Prewitt and Grombacher (1974) have
assigned sites along the Navasota River to the La Harpe
Aspect. It appears, at least from the surficial evidence,
that the Archaic sites recorded during the course of the
present survey are also more closely affiliated with the
La Harpe Aspect than with the Central Texas Archaic.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

17

THE LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
The transition from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric
period is defined on the basis of changes in subsistence
patterns and material culture. The introduction of the bow
and arrow, indicated by the recovery of small arrow type
projectile points, is a diagnostic attribute of this period.
Other technological innovations of the Late Prehistoric,
such as the manufacture of decorated ceramics and the development of agriculture, are not as widely recognized in
Central Texas as in other parts of the general region.
The Late Prehistoric Central Texas Aspect has been
subdivided into two foci, the Austin and the Toyah, which
are defined on the basis of stratigraphically distinct artifact types (Kelley 1947a, 1947b; Jelks 1962). The Austin
Focus (aa. A.O. 500-1,000) was probably an indigenous
development from the Central Texas Archaic. The same
hunting-gathering subsistence economy persisted, but technological advances such as ceramics and the bow and arrow
indicate a different pattern of resource utilization and
procurement. By this period, the population of Central
Texas was in direct trade contact with the Caddo, a sedentary agricultural people to the east, as well as with
pueblo groups to the southwest. Large sedentary villages
in the Brazos River valley indicate at least partial reliance on agriculture which did not persist into historic
times. Jelks (1962: 92-93) suggests that these sedentary
villages resulted when people of the Central Texas Aspect
were in the process of changing to, or at least experimenting with, an agriculturally based subsistence strategy,
perhaps as a result of Caddoan influence. For some reason
the experiment was abandoned, and the older hunting and
gathering pattern was reinstated. Upon further investigation, sites in the Brazos-Little Brazos floodplains may be
found to represent sedentary village occupations.
It has been suggested that sites of the Toyah Focus
(A.O. 1200 to 1650) may represent late prehistoric/early
historic occupations of the Jumano or Tonkawa Indians
(Kelley 1947a: 121; Suhm 1958: 84). Although both groups
were in the project area in historic times, their association with the Toyah Focus archeological remains has yet to
be satisfactorily demonstrated.
THE HISTORIC PERIOD
The final stage in Central Texas is the Historic,
during which indigenous populations seem to be severely
under-represented in the archeological record. No aboriginal historic groups have been identified in the project

18

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

area even though a number of aboriginal groups, including
the Tonkawa, Jumano, Wichita, Lipan Apache and Comanche,
were present during the period of European contact and
settlement (See Part II: Historic Resources).
The Tonkawa were a semi-nomadic marginal Plains group
who inhabited the grasslands of Central Texas. Although
they are assumed to have been an indigenous culture, their
unclarified relationship to late archeological remains
represents a serious gap in the archeological understanding
of the area.
Spanish and French documents of the late seventeenth and
early eighteenth centuries report that the Jumano carried on
extensive trading activities with both the Trans-Pecos groups to
the west, and the Caddo in East Texas. The Jumano were apparently absorbed by the southern Apache early in the Historic
period (Kelley 1955; Suhm 1958: 66), and have not been recognized archeologically.
In the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Wichita
peoples including the Waco, Kichai and Tawakoni were pressured
into Central Texas from the central Plains. The Stansbury Site
in Hill County probably represents the remains of a Tawakoni
village (Suhm 1958: 66-67), but no other archeological
remains are known to represent these tribes. Two other
Plains groups, the Comanche and the Lipan Apache, raided
into Central Texas from at least the early 1700 1 s, but no
archeological evidence of their presence has been found.
By 1859, all Caddo and Wichita speaking peoples in
Central and fast Texas had been removed to reservations
near Anadarko, Oklahoma (Johnson 1962: 148). The Tonkawa
were similarly removed in 1889, eliminating all indigenous
groups in Central Texas. Only occasional Comanche or
Apache raiding parties invaded the area after this date.
The paucity of identified archeological remains representing these groups is a major data deficiency which should
be addressed in subsequent work.
THE DESIGN OF THE SURVEY
ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to the inception of the field survey, a thorough
search of published literature was conducted to gain familiarity with the archeological and environmental backgrounds
of the prospects. The files of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin,
were examined to determine the extent of previous archeological investigation in Robertson County and the nature

THE DESIGN OF THE SURVEY

19

and precise location of any previously recorded sites.
Fifteen aboriginal sites had been formally reported; three
of these, 41RT13, RT14 and RT15, are within the boundaries
of the Cole Creek Prospect near the Navasota River. The
records of the Texas Historical Commission listed no sites
nominated to, or approved for, inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places.
THE SAMPLING DESIGN
A sampling design was devised in response to a request
from the sponsor for a stratified, randomly-derived 15
percent sample of the two prospects based on acreage estimates of 20,000 in the Calvert Prospect and 30,000 in Cole
Creek. Stratification by topographic zone was based on
the ratio of uplands to lowlands within each project area.
Using the 350-foot contour as the approximate line of
demarcation, the Calvert Prospect is 47 percent upland and
53 percent lowland, and the Cole Creek Prospect 90 percent
upland and 10 percent lowland.
Random transects were selected as the most efficient
method of acquiring a representative sample of sites located
in diverse micro-environmental zones. In addition, the
survey of long corridors would increase the potential for
investigation of promising site localities outside the
transect boundaries.
A Cartesian (single quadrant) grid was established
over each prospect with the X axis parallel to its longest
dimension. To facilitate selection of transect locations
in the long, narrow Cole Creek Prospect (Fig. 1), the X
axis was divided into 100 m. intervals and the Y axis into
1 m. intervals. The X and Y coordinates of the midpoint
of the transect were selected by random number generation.
The transects were then extended from this midpoint on a
northeast, southwest diagonal which 1) cross-cut the drainages, thus more effectively sampling the micro-environmental
zones, and 2) generally paralleled the prevailing orientation of existing landmarks such as fen~elines, powerlines
and roads to aid the field crew in locating and following
the corridors. The latter proved to be unnecessary because
the low altitude, high resolution, large format aerial
photographs supplied by Phillips provided much more accurate locational detail.
Calvert Prospect
A 15 percent sample of the 20,000 acres originally
estimated for the Calvert Prospect would require eighty-one

20

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

100xl500 m. or sixty-one 100x2000 m. transects. To preserve
the randomness of the sample, the coordinates of 110 transect midpoints were generateq, allowing a 5 percent margin
of alternate locations in the event that land access was
denied. Subsequent alterations to the prospect boundaries
eliminated nine of these transects which were on unleased
land.
After inception of the field work, it became apparent
that the actual acreage of both prospects exceeded the
estimates by 50 percent. As computed from grid coordinates,
the Calvert Prospect contains approximately 30,845 acres.
To accomodate this discrepancy, all randomly generated
100xl500 m. transects were surveyed, achieving a 12. 1 percent (3,743.5 acres) sample.
Cole Creek Prospect
Based on the original estimate of the size of the Cole
Creek Prospect as 30,000 acres, a 15 percent sample would
be accomplished by the survey of 121 100xl500 m. or ninetyone 100x2000 m. transects. To insure the 5 percent margin
of alternate locations, 162 tran~ect midpoints were selected.
The acreage of the Cole Creek Prospect, as derived from
property ownership maps, is 47,266 acres. Landowner denial
of entry precluded access to 37 transects; the remaining 125
were extended to 100x2000 m. and were surveyed for 13. l
percent coverage (6, 177.4 acres) of the total prospect area.
In total, 9,920 acres were surveyed for an overall 12.7
percent coverage. Subsequent to the completion of the
field survey, a computer map (Laboratory of Computer Graphics
and Spatial Analysis 1975) was generated to graphically
illustrate the sampled areas of the prospects and the locations of all archeological material. One option of this
computerized mapping is the statistical assessment, through
the nearest neighbor method, of the spatial distribution of
data points. This "point distribution coefficient" implies
randomness in the range 0.91 to 1.25. An evaluation of the
coordinates of the transects in the Calvert Prospect produces a coeffient of 0.98, a completely random distribution.
The Cole Creek Prospect, where rights to access were more
restricted, maintains a 1,22 coefficient, still within the
bounds of randomness.

THE FIELD SURVEY
In preparation for the field survey, the prospect
boundaries, the locations of all previously recorded sites
and the locations of all randomly generated transects were
plotted on USGS 7.5 topographic maps. This information
1

THE DESIGN QF THE SURVEY

21

was then transferred to a clear plastic overlay for use on
large aerial mosaics of the prospects provided by Phillips.
These photographs provided an immediate reference to terrain,
current vegetation and accessibility, and greatly facilitated
daily field operations. For field use, transect .locations
were transferred to individual 9"x9" photographs by means of
clear plastic sheets taped to the aerials. These individual
photographs were to prove invaluable in precisely locating
and accurately following transects in the field.
Permission was sought from individual landowners prior
to entry. Denial of access was not a problem in the Calvert
Prospect, but it did prevent several substantial tracts
from being surveyed in the Cole Creek Prospect.
The field survey was initiated on June l, 1978, under
the supervision of Carolyn Good. The field crew consisted
of Molly B. Godwin, Jean Landrum and Richard Wilshusen.
Each of the random transects was surveyed on foot by
at least two crew members walking a zigzag pattern approximately 50 m. apart. Promising site localities visible from
the transects, such as prominences or rises along streams,
were generally investigated and any sites found in these
areas were recorded. The small aerial photographs and USGS
topographic maps were used for locational purposes and to
record site locations.
A transect journal was maintained to provide a synopsis
of each transect. Information recorded in this journal
generally includes: property ownership, date surveyed and
by whom, a description of topography, soils, vegetation,
and current land use, the location and description of any
aboriginal or historic sites observed, and a sketch map for
locational reference. A photographic record of the different types of terrain, vegetative cover, ground visibility
and site localities was kept (Figs. 4 and 5).
Standard University of Texas site survey forms were
completed for each aboriginal site encountered. Information
recorded includes: a general site description, cultural
affiliation (if determined), a descriptive and specific
site location listing latitude, longitude and USGS topographic map reference, a sketch map, the areal extent and
depth of fill if known, artifacts observed or collected,
date of recording and by whom, and land ownership. Small
collections of time-diagnostic artifacts and lithic debitage were made from most of the sites. Minimal testing was
conducted on sites which showed promise of subsurface
cultural remains. All documentation and materials are on
file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The
University of Texas at Austin.
An attempt was made to contact avocational archeologi sts for information about the sources of their collections.

22

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

rhe few who could be located stated that the most prom1s1ng
areas were some distance north of the project area on the
Brazos River, at what are apparently large and rather late
sites on the river terrace. Landowners who infrequently
found materials on their property would occasionally make
them available for study. The largest collection examined
belongs to Bobby Bell, an employee of the Camp Cooley Ranch,
who obtained artifacts from sites near the Navasota River
on Camp Cooley.
RESULTS OF THE SURVEY
Sixty-one aboriginal sites were located during the
field survey, and three previously identified sites were
re-examined (Fig. 6). Of the sixty-one newly recorded
sites, forty lie within the Calvert Prospect (Table I) and
only two of those were not recorded as a direct result of
transect survey. Thus, the 3,743.5 acre random sample in
the Calvert Prospect yielded thirty-eight archeological
sites.
Twenty-four sites are now known to exist within the
Cole Creek Prospect (Table II). Four were located with
the assistance of local informants, and are outside the
transect boundaries. The three previously recorded sites,
41RT13, RT14 and RT15, were coincidentally intercepted by
random transects; these sites were relocated and re-evaluated.
Thus, a total of twenty sites lie within the limits of the
6,177.4 acre random sample of the Cole Creek Prospect.
Fifty-eight sites were recorded during transect survey.
This figure includes archeological remains located during
travel to and from specific transects and those found in
promising localities which were also e~afuined in the process
of the transect survey. Therefore, the actual area surveyed
is greater than the 12.7 percent sample calculated from
the transect areas alone.
Superficially, the site density in the Calvert Prospect
would appear to be significantly higher than that in Cole
Creek. However, this impression is somewhat deceptive.
Most of the archeological sites found in both prospects
are in areas considered by this study as lowlands. Fiftythree percent of the Calvert Prospect is composed of lowlands, while only ten percent of the Cole Creek area may
be so considered. Thus, when only the archeologically
sensitive portion of each prospect is considered, the apparent trend is reversed. The lowlands of Cole Creek, with
one site recorded for each thirty acres, exhibits a higher
site density than the Calvert Prospect, with one site for
each fifty-two acres.

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

In retrospect, it is clear that an arbitrary elevation
too general a criteria by which to stratify the two
prospects. In the future, such a stratification system
must be based on a far more detailed understanding of the
environmental divisions of an area. The type of environmental studies conducted in conjunction with this cultural
resource assessment should provide the level of background
required.
Only eleven of the sixty-four sites yielded lithic
or ceramic time-diagnostic artifacts. While it would be
spurious to establish a relative age for a particular site
on the basis of one or two diagnostic artifacts, general
comments concerning the overall chronology of the area can
be made.
The time span indicated by the collected artifacts extends
from Paleoindian, represented by the surface find of a basal
element of a possible Plainview point (Fig. 9f), to the
Late Prehistoric. Artifacts indicative of the Middle to
Late Archaic, such as Yarbrough~ Bulverde~ Wells and Dawson
dart points, and the Late Prehistoric, such as plain ceramics, Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points, and Friday and
Covington knives, are the most numerous.
No historic
aboriginal remains were found during the survey.
The paucity of both very early and very late materials
merits some discussion in view of the fact that aboriginal
peoples were certainly present in Central Texas throughout
the entire time span previously discussed. Sites representing Paleoindian-Early Archaic occupation may either
be deeply buried in the river valleys along old channels,
or be in upland areas where erosion has obscured or destroyed their remains. If buried, no method of surficial
survey would have succeeded in identifying these resources.
Late Pleistocene paleontological materials have eroded from
the banks of the Brazos River in several locations, one of
which is in the Calvert Prospect. Paleoindian remains
contemporaneous with these Pleistocene fauna may similarly
be found in deeply buried sediments. If located during
subsequent testing, coring or mining operations, Paleoindian
or Early Archaic remains should be recognized as extremely
important archeological materials which should not be
destroyed.
The lack of recognizable archeological materials of
early Historic age may be due to the possible disturbance
of lowland sites, and the presumed ephemeral nature of
upland camp sites. Historic aboriginal villages are known
to have existed in the Brazos River Valley north of the
survey area (see Part II), and are presumed to have occurred
along the Brazos River in the survey area. This is, unfortunately, an area which has been under intensive

cultivation for at least 100 years. Of the sites found
in the Brazos River Valley during the current survey, at
least one, 41RT19, yielded points of a late style, but no
historic trade materials. Further testing of this site
and other similar terrace sites may produce historic material such as glass trade beads. The camps of late historic
Indians, such as the Comanche and Lipan Apache who reportedly raided into Central Texas in the early 1700's, might
consist of little more than a small hearth, minor lithic
remains, and discarded or lost items of European manufacture.
Presumably, these camps would have been used for very brief
periods of time, resulting in minor accumulations of cultural remains. Hence, even slight disturbance or erosion
might prove sufficient to obliterate these sites.
The majority of the time-diagnostic artifacts recovered
indicate that most of the sites located during the survey
represent Middle to Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations. The majority of these sites, 81 percent, are small
(less than 500 square meters in areal extent, see Tables III), areas of light lithic scatter, typically lacking diagnostic artifacts, and generally found above the tributaries
of the Brazos River on sandy rises or low ridges. These
sites may represent camps, or perhaps special use areas.
The definition of site types can be accomplished only after
test excavations have revealed the features, faunal material
or artifacts whose presence may not be indicated by surficial remains.
Approximately 15 percent of the remaining sites range
from 500 to 1000 square meters in areal extent, with two
very large sites, 41RT30 and RT53, covering 1500 and 1800
square meters respectively. These larger sites are located
both along rises of the Brazos and Navasota river tributaries
or mainstems, and in the river valleys proper. Most of the
diagnostic artifacts, and the bulk of the other lithic
materials, were retrieved from these sites. The presence
of burned or fire-cracked rock, burned bone, and mussel
shell at many of these sites indicate that they were at
least semi-permanent habitation sites.
The sites located during the survey tend to concentrate
along the tributaries of the Brazos River, specifically the
Walnut Creek tributary system {Walnut, South Walnut and
Bee Branch creek), Mud Creek and the Little Brazos River.
The Walnut Creek drainage system contains twenty-one sites,
or about 33 percent of the total located during the survey.
In contrast is the overwhelming paucity of sites in the
rolling upland divide between the Brazos and Navasota
rivers. Even along well-established spring-fed creeks
like Mineral Creek, few sites are found any distance from
the major river drainages. The extremely low density of

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS

31

sites on the uplands between the two rivers may reflect the
severe erosion of many upland areas formerly used for agriculture, and the resulting obliteration of archeological
remains. However, this paucity of prehistoric remains is
corroborated by the findings of other archeological surveys
conducted in similar upland environments near the present
project area (Skelton and Freeman 1979; Wooldridge 1979;
Turpin and Kluge 1980).
The location of sites along tributaries close to the
mainstem rivers would have allowed tne inhabitants easy
access to the major ecosystems of the area: the mainstem
river, the smaller tributary valleys, and the uplands. The
variety of plants and animals and other natural resources
available for exploitation would thus be increased, especially when seasonal variation is considered. Sites along
these tributaries would also have been more protected and
in less danger of flooding than those in the mainstem river
valleys.
ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS
The following descriptions include only the potentially
diagnostic archeological material collected in the course of
the Calvert and Cole Creek prospect surveys. Typological
identifications, unless otherwise noted, are based on the
Handbook of Texas Archeology: Type Descriptions by Suhm and
Jelks (1962). All measurements are in centimeters; L ~
length, W = width, T = thickness, * = incomplete measurement.
CERAMIC ARTIFACTS
Four ceramic artifacts were recovered from three sites
during the survey. Although all four are undecorated, they
vary in tempering material and firing. Because of the small
number of sherds collected and the lack of distinguishing
characteristics, no attempt has been made to assign them to
type. However, plain ceramics such as those described below
are typically found only in transitional Archaic or Late
Prehistoric sites.
Calvert Prospect Ceramics

One small body sherd was collected from the surface of
this site on the Little Brazos River. It was produced by
coiling, has smooth interior and exterior surfaces, and is

32

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

0.7 cm. thick. The interior color is buff, the exterior
a light red or rust color which is assumed to be the result
of firing rather than intentional coloring or slipping. The
paste is coarse, as is the temper, which consists of quartz
and hematite sand grains and crushed bone, some of which
is burned. The sherd is partially oxydized, with the interior core dark and the exterior light.
Cole Creek Prospect Ceramics
41RT13
Two sherds were collected at this large site on the
Navasota River. One was a surface find, while the other
was recovered from washed matrix in Test Pit A, about 37
cm. below ground surface. Both are 0.6 cm. thick body
sherds produced by coiling, and both have smooth, brown
interior and exterior surfaces. The two sherds differ in
temper and firing. The surface sherd has a coarse paste
with quartz sand temper and a dark core. The sherd from
Test Pit A has a finer paste, fewer sand inclusions, and
a dark core, but appears to be more highly fired than the
surface find.
41RT70
One sherd, a basal fragment 1 cm. thick, was found on
the surface of this site. The sherd has smooth interior
and exterior surfaces which are buff in color. The exterior
has a patch of gray fire clouding. The paste is coarse
and the temper consists of quartz sand and grog. The sherd
crumbles easily, indicating a low firing temperature, and
has a dark core.
LITHIC ARTIFACTS
The lithic artifacts collected during the survey include
dart and arrow points, scrapers, knives, a gouge, choppers,
cores, hammerstones, and uni facially and bifacially worked
tools of indeterminate function. Debitage from tool manufacture included primary, secondary and tertiary flakes,
and cores, and constitutes the most abundant culturally
produced items in the survey area. Except where noted, all
artifacts appear to have been manufactured from locally
available materials, including cherts and quartzite available as river cobbles in the beds of most of the drainages
or from gravel outcrops along the Brazos River in Milam
County. While slabs of petrified wood were found in some
sites, only a few flakes and no tools were made of this
locally abundant material.

In general, the collection of diagnostic artifacts
which resulted from the survey was meager. These objects
have, however, provided the only means of relatively dating
the sites on which they were found.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Robert~on County is poorly known archeologically, and
yet is an area of potential interest from which significant
information about the aboriginal peoples of Central Texas
can be derived. This geographical area, between the Brazos
and the Navasota rivers, was probably influenced through
time by cultures from the west along the Edwards Plateau,
from the east in the Pine Belt of East Texas, and, more
recently, by Plains cultures from the north. The influx
or influence of these various groups has resulted in a
collage of archeological remains which is yet to •be clearly
understood.
The current study successfully identified the frequency
and characteristics of surficial archeological remains
within the sample of the Calvert and Cole Creek prospects.
Future research should be oriented towards acquiring more
specific information relevant to determining a regional
chronology and settlement pattern through time by intensive
survey and test excavations. Once mining plans have been
finalized, a phased investigation is proposed. Those areas
selected as priority mining tracts should be intensively
surveyed, the results of this survey evaluated and a sample
of sites selected for further testing using criteria relevant to the central problems of chronology and settlement
patterns.
While it is suggested that a sample of different sites
be tested, specific recommendations listed below are biased
toward what appear to be occupation sites which may have
been used repeatedly. This type of site is considered to
be the most useful for establishing a relative chronology
as a framework for the placement of more limited or functionally specific sites. If a temporal sequence can be
established at these larger sites, a sample of smaller sites
can be selected to address questions concerning site function.
As a result of the present survey, the prospects may be
viewed in terms of high, moderate and low site density.
Areas of low site density are restricted to rolling or

RECOMMENDATIONS

47

high terrain away from the major river and tributary valleys
and include the area immediately west of Calvert and much
of the midsection of the Cole Creek Prospect. Moderate site
density is found in the floodplains of the river valleys;
site density is the highest along the breaks above the
floodplains and well-developed tributary systems like Walnut
Creek. General recommendations for the future survey and
testing of these areas are presented.
In areas of low site density, intensive survey should
emphasize locations which seem well suited for site placement, such as high prominences or the confluences of minor
creeks, which were not included in this random sample.
Since erosion is severe in these upland areas, it is
doubtful that subsurface probing would greatly enhance site
recognition except in areas of dense vegetative cover. Although it appears that most of the sites in the low density
areas consist entirely of surface remains, testing of a
sample of these sites should be undertaken to establish
their characteristics in terms of regional synthesis. Site
41RT64 (see Table II), in the Cole Creek Prospect, is an
example of this type of site which merits limited testing.
The moderate site density in the mainstem river valleys
may be the result of several factors: natural erosion,
agricultural disturbance or burial of sites by alluviation.
Intensive survey in these areas should be accompanied by
nonrandom testing for buried sites in high probability areas.
Specific sites recorded by the current survey in moderate
site density areas which are recommended for further testing
are 41RT17 and RT19, both of which lie within the Calvert
Prospect.
41RT17 - Located east of the Little Brazos River and
south of Black Bridge Road, this site extends along a low
ridgeline or series of hills overlooking the Little Brazos
River. Surface collecting yielded lithic debitage, an
unidentifiable projectile point, a ceramic sherd, burned
bone and mussel shell. Testing revealed a buried soil
horizon also bearing cultural debris. Further testing of
this site should be undertaken.
41RT19 - Located east of the Brazos River and south
of Black Bridge Road, this site produced an abundance of
lithic debitage, burned bone, burned rock, hammerstones,
and several small, very late, projectile points. From surface indications, this site has a Late Prehistoric occupation
and may represent a village-type habitation. As such, testing
for structural remains, presence of early historic trade
goods, and the utilization of agricultural products should
be conducted. If this site is a late village, it would be
one of the few in Central Texas ~o be investigated.
Areas of high site density also contained the largest

48

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

and potentially the deepest sites located during this survey.
Therefore, these areas may be the most useful in establishing
a regional chronology. Subsequent to intensive survey and
subsurface probing for buried material, a representative
sample of sites should be selected for test excavations. One
site in the Cole Creek Prospect, 41RT13, is recommended for
additional testing. Two sites in the Calvert Prospect, both
located in the Walnut Creek system, the most archeologically
sensitive area in either prospect, merit further excavation 41RT30 and RT53.
.
41RT13 - during this initial survey an erosional gully
was profiled and a one square meter test pit was excavated
at this site on the Navasota River. Testing and surface
collecting yielded ceramics, burned bone, burned rock,
mussel shell, charred seeds, several projectile points and
lithic debitage. The areal extent of the site is 800 square
meters and the depth of cultural deposits exceeds 76 cm.
This site may represent a Late or Transitional Archaic village.
Because of the preservation of faunal material, the site could
produce significant information about plant and animal exploitation.
41RT30 - Located north of Calvert and east of Highway 6
on the south bank of Walnut Creek, this site overlooks the
valley of the Little Brazos River. Little can be determined
about the age of the site from the surface collection, but its
size and location indicate a possible long term occupation site.
41RT53 - This site is located on a distinct bluff overlooking the floodplain of the Little Brazos River, west of
the intersection of Highways 6 and 2159. Like 41RT30, this
site is quite large and occupies a commanding position.
Surface artifacts indicate a Late Prehistoric, possibly
Central Texas Aspect, occupation.
In summary, major problems which should be addressed in
future work include establishing a firm chronology for the
area and determining site functions and distribution through
time. Sufficient information is not available at this time
to make statements concerning National Register of Historic
Places elegibility of specific sites. Upon further survey
and testing, some sites may warrant National Register consideration. All areas to be affected by mining and related
construction should be intensively surveyed prior to disturbance. The specific recommendations offered in this report
should be reviewed in the context of the results of an
intensive survey and a representative sample of the sites
should be selected for further testing. It is hoped that
this report provides a framework for these more specific
investigations.

A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF THE HISTORIC RESOURCES

Martha Doty Freeman

This page intentionally left blank.

ABSTRACT
During June and July of J978, a prelimina~y survey of
historic sites was conducted for the Phillips Coal Company
on Zand included within the Calvert and Cole Creek prospects
of Robertson County, Texas.
One hundPed and one historic
sites of various types, ranging from cemeteries to individual
houses to entire towns were recorded or otherwise noted in
the two prospect areas.
Of this total number, perhaps 30.
percent of the sites were considered deserving of further
work in varying degrees of intensity, from limited testing
to complete recording.
While only a small proportion of all existing sites in
the prospect areas is thought to have been located, it can
be assumed that the range of site types which may be located
in future surveys has been identified in this initial survey.
Such sites may date from earliest seventeenth-century Tonkawa
and Wichita occupation to evidences of Spanish expeditions
which ventured north of the Camino Real.
Other periods of
important historic activity occurred during the era of
earliest Anglo settlements and the establishment of
Robertson's Colony, and the decade during which large
numbers of planters from the Deep South acquired Zand along
the Brazos River.
An examination of the two prospects
indicates that most of the readily identifiable archeological
sites and standing structures date from the post-~850 period
when Robertson was one of Texas' most prosperous agricultural counties.

INTRODUCTION
The Brazos River is one of the Southwest's great waterways. Snaking southeastward from a stark stretch of New
Mexico, it runs for something more than 800 miles to the
Gulf of Mexico. It is a variable river -- gypsum-salty on
the High Plains, it becomes a Southern watercourse somewhere
near Central and Coastal Texas. It is also a powerful river
-- having formed the borders of numerous Texas counties, its
slowly rolling waters have also molded many of the historic
events which played themselves out adjacent to its banks.
In Robertson County, floods created extraordinarily fertile
plains which attracted Spanish explorers and Anglo settlers,
and as early as 1826, Dr. Felix Robertson wrote that 11 the
climate and soil seems to be ccngenial to most of the productions of the southern and middle states of our union.
Sugar cane I have no doubt, will grow well in the southern
part of the [Robertson Colony] grant, and cotton will grow
in full perfection in every part of it. 11 In another

58

HISTORIC RESOURCES

portion of his report, Robertson remarked on factors which
had made the area attractive to wandering bands of Wichita
and Tonkawa Indians as we.11: "The great variety of soil
and exposure afford ample sustenance,· both summer and
winter, fQr the vast herds of .buffAloes, deer, wild horses,
and cows which are to be found in every part of the country"
( Mc Le a n l 9 7 5 : 6 0 3., 6 0 4 ) •

If much of the history of .Robertson County was influenced
by the great rive~ which formed its western boundary, that
same history was recorded largely because of the human
traffic which followed the famous camino, or road, to the
south. Blazed by Domingo Teran de los Rios, first Spanish
governor of the Province of Texas, the Old San Antonio Road,
or Camino Real, dated from around 1691 and carried much of
the significant Spanish and Mexican traffic from San Antonio
to many points in East Texas for 150 years. Forts and
settlements such as Tenoxtitlan and Bucareli grew up along
the route, and as various explorers passed along it they
recorded the existence of Indian tribes and of early Anglo
settlers in the area between the road and the Falls of the
Brazos to the north.
The history Qf the project area until the first quarter
of the nineteenth century was largely that of Indian activity
and Spanish exploration. After 1825, much of the area's
history was intimately bound up with the vagaries of
Robertson's Colony and the settlement of hundreds of Anglo
families on grants of land between the Brazos and Navasota
rivers. In 1822, the Texas Association was formed in
Tennessee for the purpose of obtaining a large land grant
from the new Mexican government, .and although almost a
decade of conflict prohibited organized settlement in the
present bounds of Robertson County, by 1830 the first
Robertson colonists had arrived. By 1840, they had taken
up grants of varying sizes between the Brazos and Navasota,
and despite the constant threat of Indian attack from villages located to the north, Anglo settlers had made a modest
start at farming and establishing permanent communities.
Jesse Webb built a home on the Little Brazos west of
present-day Calvert. The Harvey Family settled into a
log home to the north, and to the east, migrants established
the communities of Little Mississippi, Mount Vernon, and
Old Franklin.
The history of the project area up to 1850, then, was
that of a rural territory which contained a few small towns
and widely-scattered, loosely-organized settlements. While
the agricultural potential of the Brazos River bottoms had
been recognized, no large-scale efforts had been made to
develop them, and as a result, settlement was fairly evenly,
if sparsely, scattered between the lowland areas on the west
and the less fertile uplands east of present-day Calvert.

INTRODUCTION

59

1850 was a watershed year which saw the beginnings of
cataclysmic change for the entire county. Southern planters.
bringing with them technical know-how and slave labor.
arrived in Robertson County and recognized the potential
of land along the Brazos River. They purchased large tracts
from descendants of original grantees and put together plantations of thousands of acres, most of which remain in the
hands of their descendants today. Many of the historic
sites recorded within the project area date from this period
of tremendous agricultural development and involve the histories of such families as the Burnitts, Calverts, Townsends,
and Hannas, all of whom built large plantation homes.
The plantation and slave culture which flourished and
then came to an abrupt end at the close of the Civil War was
a relatively short-lived phenomenon. but it was undoubtedly
the one institution which had the greatest impact on the
development of Robertson County. Personal prosperity
spread county-wide as the cotton economy boomed, and entrepreneurs recognized the potential wealth that could be
theirs with the construction of railroads such as the
Houston and Texas Central and the International and Great
Northern.
Railroad construction was accompanied, in turn, by town
building, and as a result the last quarter of the nineteenth
century saw a simultaneous depopulation of rural areas not
accessible by railroad and a repopulation of new towns
located on railroad routes. As Calvert, Hearne, and
Franklin grew. small communities within the project area
declined. until towns such as Owensville, Mount Vernon,
and Little Mississippi all but disappeared.
Because of a disparity in natural wealth, the eastern
portion of Robertson County-has never been the location of
large or closely-spaced settlements. As a result, historical
remains east of present-day Calvert appear to be more widely
dispersed than those between Calvert and the Brazos River.
On the other hand. historic sites within both areas are of
approximately equivalent age, with most recorded sites
dating from the latter half of the nineteenth century.
SPANISH EXPLORATION. 1691-1778
The land that eventually became Robertson County was
bounded on the south by one of the most famous roads in
Coahuila and Texas. Laid out along a route approximately
followed by Domingo Teran in 1691, the Old San Antonio
Road. or Camino Real, left San Antonio, headed northeast,
crossed the Colorado, Brazos, and Navasota rivers, passed
through the Spanish settlement of Pilar de Bucareli, and

60

HISTORIC RESOURCES

continued on to Nacogdoches. As the most direct link
between San Antonio and Nacogdoches, it was heavily used
throughout the eighteenth century, especially after 1720
when the Spanish became committed to the reoccupation1 of
East Texas following the French attack on Los Adaes.
The task of Spanish reoc.cupation had fallen to the
Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo and it was his expedition
of 1720-1721 which first passed through a portion of the
territory now encompassed within the project area. His
group set out at the end of 1720, crossed the Rio Grande
on March 23, 1721, and followed Teran s Camino Real to
San Antonio. At that point, on May 13, Aguayo decided to
diverge from Teran s route, and heading north he struck
the Brazos near present-day Waco. He then turned east and
south, following the Brazos River until he intercepted the
Old San Antonio Road.
Such a route would have led Aguayo through the entire
length of Robertson County, and scholars of his route have
speculated that he probably traveled to about the center
of the county, covering ground that was alternately
1

1

"flowery plains, then broken and plain ground,
and finally woodland and vine-covered country.
For the next three days the route lay east and
northeast -- the purpose of this detour most
probably beirig to seek higher ground . . . .
The last part of the march lay in boggy wooded
land, with the ground covered with flint stones
which wounded and poisoned the cattle" (Buckley
1911: 40).
By the end of July, Aguayo•s party ended up at what
Buckley speculates was probably present-day Big Cedar· Creek
near its juncture with the Navasnta. The next few days
were accupied with bridging the Navasota in the vicinity
of the Camino Real crossing (Buckley 1911: 40-41).
Aguayo•s was the only expedition to actually traverse
the project area. But other Spanish explorers skirted it
and left reports in which they speculated about its appearance and the Indians who inhabited it. In 1716, for~example,
the expedition of Diego Ramon passed through Rancheria
Grande, a conglomeration of tribes from many parts of
southern and central Texas located north of Little River

1

The various routes of the Camino Real, as well as the
controversy surrounding the identity of the person who actually "laid out" the road, are covered by Eleanor Claire
Buckley (1911: 34-35n).

and two to three leagues west of the Brazos near presentday Cameron (Bolton 1970: 142-144). In 1772, Pedro de
Rivera y Villalon traveled through the general area on
an inspection tour, and gave the Navasota its present name.
Ortiz Parrilla led an expedition of 500 men from San Antonio
in 1759 to conquer a Tonkawa village on the north side of
the Brazos near the future Robertson's Colony; and eight
years later, Pierre Marie Francois de Pag~s made a trip
from Nacogdoches to San Antonio, passing on the southern
boundary of the future Robertson's Colony and publishing
his observations in Travels around the World . . . (Mclean
1974: xxix-xxx).
Perhaps the most extensive reporting on the perimeters
of Robertson County was accomplished by Athanase de Mezieres,
who between 1772 and 1779 made a series of trips to contact
various Indian tribes near the Trinity and Brazos rivers.
In 1771, he had been ordered to extend a trade system to the
Wichita Confederacy, or Nations of the North, and to investigate
English traders rumored. to be among them. In order to expand
the system, he left Natchitoches in March of 1772, crossed the
Sabine, Angelina, and Neches rivers, and entered a Kichai village
near the Trinity River. From this location, he continued on to
the Yscani and Tawakoni tribes, to the Tonkawa further west,
and from there to a Tawakoni village on the right bank of the
Brazos River near present-day Waco (Bolton 1914 I: 96-97, 101,
109-110).
Six years later, De Mezi~res traveled to the Spanish
settlement of Bucareli, located approximately where the Camino
Real crossed the Trinity River. He then proceeded eighteen
leagues north to a Kichai village, fifteen leagues west to a
Tonkawa settlement, and sixteen leagues farther westward to the
Tawakoni village which he had visited six years before. A
·
subsequent trip, made in 1779, followed approximately the same
route (Bolton 1914 I: 113-114, 116-120).
INDIAN TRIBES IN THE PROSPECT AREAS
-- SOME HISTORIC ACCOUNTS
Although the Aguayo Expedition of 1721 was the only
one to actually pass through the center of Robertson County,
the expeditions of Diego Ramon, Rivera y Villalon, Ortiz
Parrilla, Francois de Pages, and De Mezieres are useful to
assess because~their reports of various Indian tribes located
on the perimeters of the project area may suggest something
of the identities of tribes who lived within or passed
through it. An examination of documentary accounts reveals
that a number of tribes were described -- Yojuane, Deadose,

villages subsequently visited by the Nicacio Sanches
Expedition of August 17-September 22, 1830. The Camino
de las Hueoos which led from the Waco village on the Brazos
to San Felipe de Austin probably passed through the
present-day Calvert Prospect.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Mayeye, Ervipiame. Waco, Kichai. and Tawakoni -- all of
which were members of, or later affiliated with, the Tonkawa
and Wichita groups.
Tonkawa
Although some authors have suggested that certain
Tonkawan subgroups may have been encountered by the expeditions of Cabeza de Vaca and De Soto (Sjoberg 1953: 281),
it is more likely that the historic record for the Tonkawa
Indians began with the account of Francisco de Jesus Maria,
who in 1691 included them with the Yojuane (Jones 1969: 65;
Sjoberg 1953: 282). In general, however, their identification as Tonkawa, per se, remained a clouded issue until well
into the eighteenth century, for when they were first
encountered by Europeans the Tonkawa were not a single
tribe but rather a conglomeration of linguistically-related
tribes. Groups which comprised the Tonkawa proper at that
time included the Mayeye, Yojuane, and eventually, some
Ervipiame, who merged with other Tonkawan groups at the end
of the eighteenth century.
Scattered accounts of various Tonkawa bands appeared
throughout the opening years of the eighteenth century.
Espinosa met the Yojuane near the Colorado River in 1709,
and in 1718-1719 the Alarcon Expedition encountered the
Sana, Emet, Toho, Mayeye, and possibly the Yojuane west of
the Brazos River (Sjoberg 1953: 282). Their range was
further extended by Du Rivage who, as a member of Benard
de la Harpe's expedition, recorded the presence of Tonkawa
on the Red River in 1719. Such a sighting, however, may
give a false sense of the extent of the Tonkawa range, for
as Jones has noted, their nomadic life more frequently led
them along a broad belt from the San Antonio Road on the
southwest to the Neches on the northeast, extending about
125 miles on either side of the Camino Real between San
Antonio and Nacogdoches (Jones 1969: 66}.
In 1745, chiefs of some Tonkawa groups -- the Mayeye
and Yojuane -- requested that the Spanish found missions
within their territory. As a result of this request,
Mission San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas was established
on the San Gabriel River. The cooperation and friendship
which the mission represented was all too short-lived,
however, and the inhabitants eventually dispersed. In
1758, they joined the Comanche in an attack on the Lipan
Apache mission on the San Saba River near the present-day
town of Menard.
By the last quarter of the eighteenth century, the
Tonkawa were still living between the middle reaches of
the Trinity and Colorado rivers (Sjoberg 1953: 282). At

that time, they included an estimated 300 warriors of
various Tonkawa bands who had formed a confederacy as a
result of the considerable pressure exerted by wars with
Comanche Indians on the west, Wichita on the north, and
Europeans in Central Texas (Hasskarl 1962: 221). Until
the period of burgeoning Anglo activity in the 1830's and
1840 1 s, their range remained essentially stable.
European accounts and an examination of Tonkawa artifacts by various scholars support a broad conclusion that
the Tonkawa were a Plains Indian group (Jones 1969: 77-78).
Although scholars are uncertain about the Tonkawas' prehistoric affiliations, there is no support for the conclusion that their archeological associations were with an
area south of Central Texas (Newcomb 1961: 134).
A number of writers, including Mayhall (1939) 2 , Hasskarl
(1962), and Jones (1969), have outlined the distinguishing
characteristics of the Tonkawa .. In general, they were
described as vagabonds, De Mezi~res noting in 1772 that
they were '"a people without fixed homes, of undeveloped
language, and disposed to thievery'" (Jones 1969: 66).
While they were known to hunt deer, rabbits, squirrels, turkeys,
prairie chickens, skunks, rats, raccoons, opposums, and
snakes, and to catch fresh water clams, turtles, and fish
(Hasskarl 1962: 218), buffalo was the most important animal
to them. As De Mezi~res pointed out in 1780, the Tonkawa
ate buffalo flesh, used brains to soften skins, horns
for spoons and drinking vessels, shoulder bones for digging
and clearing the land, tendons for making thread and bow
strings, hoofs for arrow glue, manes for ropes and girths,
wool for garters, belts, and ornaments, and skins for
harnesses, lassos, shields, tents, shirts, leggings, shoes
and blankets (Jones 1969: 66).
Collecting of plant foods ranked next in importance to
hunting for the Tonkawa who gathered a number of herbs,
edible roots, and wild fruits. Agriculture was less widely
relied upon, but there is at least one report of an effort
to cultivate land at the headwaters of the Brazos {Sjoberg
1953: 286-287). As might be expected, reports of the
practice of horticulture increased following the Tonkawas'

mission experience on the San Gabriel in the mid-eighteenth
century and the gradual disappearance of buffalo herds
during the nineteenth century.
Shelter consisted of bison hide tipis and, after the
buffalo herds were reduced in number, of brush lodges
described by Gatschet as being constructed of cane or willow
sticks. The Jodges were flat on top, open on two sides,
and covered with brushwood, blankets, and skins on top and
on the closed sides (Hasskarl 1962: 218; Mayhall 1939: 451452).
According to Hasskarl, the clan was the basic unit of
Tonkawa social structure. All clans were matrilineal, and
marriage within clans was GOnsidered incestuous. A number
of clans frequently comprised a band, which was led by a
chief who· Was selected by a council of mature men (1962:
219).
The Tonkawa shared several physical characteristics with
other Texas tribes. Both men and women practiced tattooing
and painting, and the men wore ornaments of bone, shell
and feathers on their ears, neck, and hair. They wore
long breechclouts, moccasins and leggings, and shirts and
robes in colder weather, while women wore shirts and
moccasins (Hasskarl 1962: 217).
One trait -- cannibalism -- tended to differentiate the
Tonkawa. While some nineteenth-century writers recounted
instances of what they believed to be the practice of cannibalism to satisfy physical hunger, most authors believe the
practice was closely associated with ceremonial activities
{Sjoberg 1953: 295-296; Hasskarl 1962: 218). Cannibalism
was reported as early as 1719 by Du Rivage. However, most
reports were made during the first half of the nineteenth
century when victims included such traditional enemies as
the Waco, Karankawa, Seminole, Shawnee, Kiowa, Kichai, and
Comanche (Sjoberg 1953: 295).
Wichita
The area around the Brazos River, which was home for
the Tonkawa was also the location of numerous Wichita
Indians. Originally natives of the Canadian and upper Red
rivers, the Wichita had moved southward around 1700, eventually inhabiting territory between the Brazos and Trinity
rivers (Bolton 1914 I: 23).
Most scholars agree that the Wichita Confederacy was
comprised of four subtribes which belonged to the Caddoan
linguistic stock: the Wichita proper, Waco, Tawakoni, and
Kichai (Douglas 1932: n.p.; Newcomb 1961: 250). While
cultural differences may once have distinguished each of

- - - - - - - - -

INDIAN TRIBES

67

these subgroups, such differences eventually disappeared
as the tribes became reduced in numbers, emigrated, and
were harassed by other Indians.
When first encountered by European observers, the
Wichita were living on the upper waters of the Red River
of Louisiana where the French met them in 1701. During the
same period, they invaded Texas, but their movements centered around the upper Trinity and on the Canadian River,
where Benard de la Harpe met them in 1719 (Hodge 1959 I: 682;
Wedel 1971: 43-44).
Between 1719 and the mid-eighteenth century, there
were few reports of the whereabouts of the Wichita, but
in general they seem to have been moving southward. As
a result, many of the expeditions which reported on the
Tonkawa tribes also reported on the Wichita. In 1772, De
Mezieres mentioned a Kichai village near the Trinity and
on the right bank of the Brazos near present-day Waco
(Bolton 1914 I: 96). Subsequent contacts included those by
De Mezieres in 1778 and 1779 when he was sent by Ripperda
on another mission to the Wichita and Tonkawa and encountered a Kichai village eighteen leagues north of Bucareli,
and two Tawakoni villages near present-day Waco (Bolton
1914 I: 113-114, 116-120). Their main village remained
near present-day Palestine (Hodge 1959 I: 683).
Descriptions of eighteenth-century Wichita social
organization, dwellings, economy, clothing, and personal
adornment are as comprehensive as thGse for the Tonkawa.
Like the Tonkawa, the Wichita built two different types of
shelter. One was a Plains hide tipi that was used during
buffalo hunts. The second was a beehive-shaped grass lodge,
occupied by several families, and measuring as much as
twelve to fifteen feet high and fifteen to thirty feet
across. Inside there was a central fire pit and platforms
for sleeping and storage which ran around the walls. Villages sometimes comprised as many as seventy to eighty such
houses (Douglas 1932: n.p.).
The Wichita relied heavily on buffalo meat, but unlike
the Tonkawa, they also cultivated large amounts of vegetables such as corn, squash, melons, beans, peas, and
pumpkins (Douglas 1932: n.p.; Johnson and Jelks 1958: 412;
Witte 1938: 237). They also gathered wild fruits, nuts,
berries, and seeds.
Clothing consisted of a breech cloth and moccasins
for the men and a knee-length skirt and moccasin leggings
for the women. Personal adornment was also practiced, men
sometimes wearing metal pendants which hung from holes
pierced through the ear lobe. Tattooing occurred frequently,
men marking themselves around the eyes and mouth, on the
backs of the hands, along the arms, and across the chest.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

68

Women were marked on the nose, mouth, and jaw, around the
neck, down the arms, and around the breasts (Douglas 1932:
n.p.).
Wichita and Tonkawa remained traditional enemies, but
until they were both placed on the Brazos River Reservation
in the 1850's, they shared much of the same range in Central
Texas. Pressures from Anglo-American settlers in the
region of Roqertson County after 1820 brought retaliatory
raids from Wichita and Tonkawa alike, as both tribes were
forced from territory which they had inhabited for 125
years and more.
ROBERTSON COUNTY, 1800-1850
Although difficulties between native Indian groups and
Anglo-American settlers did not peak until the 1830's and
1840's, hints of troublous times were apparent as early as
1800 when Americans first began to cast covetous glances
at Mexico's fertile territory. Twenty-one years later,
with Mexico's independence from Spain, the floodgates of
immigration opened, and from 1821 to 1830 the area that was
to become Robertson County received increasing numbers of
settlers from the States. Some came independently, sufficiently attracted by the area to brave threats of Wichita
and Tonkawa attack. The majority came as members of Robertson1 s Colony, an endeavor which was to be the primary colonizing force in Robertson County until the 1840's. 3
Earliest nineteenth-century reports on the project
area and its Indian inhabitants came from Zebulon Montgomery
Pike who described the Tonkawa he encountered on the Colorado
River, and made a map several years later which showed the
Brazos River and his travels along the Old San Antonio Road.
In 1809, another visitor, Sam Davenport, remarked that the
Tonkawa ranged between the Brazos and San Marcos above and
below the Camino Real, where they hunted deer and buffalo.
Subsequent reports on the area included those of James
Gaines, a leader of the Gutifrrez-Magee Expedition who
sent Captain Dick McFarland up the Brazos River to enlist
the ·aid of the Waco and Tawakoni Indians in helping AngloAmericans and Mexicans in their fight against the Spanish

Robertson's Colony, initiated by the Texas Association of Nashville, Tennessee, came into official existence

in San Antonio; and James Long, who in 1819 sent a Captain
Johnson to establish a trading post at the Falls of the
Brazos (Jones 1969: 66-67; Mclean 1974: xxxv, xl-xli).
The Mexican revolution of 1821 represented a turning
point, not only in Mexico's relationship to Spain, but in
her relationship to the United States as well. For the
first time, land became available for large-scale settlement
by foreign colonists, and Anglo-Americans acting as Mexican
citizens began inhabiting the area between the Colorado and
Brazos rivers. A new era emerged after 1821, and within
ten years, the non-Indian population increased from about
4,000 to about 20,000 inhabitants (Mayhall 1939: 57).
Some early settlement near the Brazos and north of
the Camino Real was unofficial. W. B. De Wees reported in
1822, for example, that he had camped at a point where the
Old San Antonio Road crossed the Brazos two miles above
the mouth of the Little Brazos. There, he had encountered
two families -- the Garretts and Hibbingses -- who were
engaged in erecting cabins in a settlement which consisted
of seven families. De Wees described the land to the north
and along the Brazos as very rich and fertile with good
timber, wild cattle, bears and peccary, a vast quantity of
bee trees, and wild rye which grew plentifully in the bottoms.
Buffalo hunting was a favorite activity, and De Wees and
his friends frequently went out for two or three weeks at
a time, traveling as far north as they dared without encountering Waco Indians (De Wees 1858: 23-27).
The small settlement which De Wees described was probably an informal attempt at colonization which may or may
not have been sanctioned by the Mexican government. Only
four-and-one-half months before his report on the Brazos,
however, a group of entrepreneurs in Kentucky and Tennessee
had taken formal steps to petition the Mexican government
for permission for a group of settlers to establish residence
in parts of Mexico contiguous to the United States. The
group which drafted the Memorial became known as the Texas
Association, and included seventy members (Mclean 1974:
xli-xlii).4
Perhaps if they had known the frustrations and hardships that were to delay their attempts to settle what is

now Robertson County, the Association members would never
have embarked on their odyssey to Mexico, changes in Association representatives, and petitions to the Mexican
government. Initially, three commissioners -- the bestknown of whom was Robert Leftwich -- were appointed to
carry the Association's Memorial to Mexico, and by the end
of April 1822, they had placed their petition for a land
grant before the Mexican Congress. According to their
revised terms of June 2, land requested included territory
between the Navasota and Brazos rivers and situated northwest of the Brazos between it and the range of mountains
dividing the waters of the Brazos and the Colorado. The
southern boundary was the Old San Antonio Road; the northern
boundary was the "road of the Comanches." The Association
obligated itself to effect the immigration of 100 or more
families within nine months, 200 or more within eighteen
months; and up to 500 families within three years.
In July 1822, two of the three commissioners left
Mexico City after Iturbide was crowned emperor, secure in
the thought that the Association's grant would soon be
awarded. Leftwich stayed behind to pick up the expected
contract, which eventually would have to conform to the
terms of the first Mexican colonization law inviting Roman
Catholic immigrants to settle in Texas, providing for the
employment of empresarios to introduce families in units of
200, and defining the various measurements of land.
In the meantime, however, events were not standing still
on the Brazos. In the winter of 1823, six families from
Kentucky had settled at the mouth of the Little River on
land the Nashville Company had petitioned to receive.
Others built temporary shelters at the future site of the
community of Nashville. The same year, Sterling Clack
Robertson visited the area for the first time and declared
it suitable for colonization. By 1824-1826, more than
thirty squatters lived in crude huts on the land requested
by the Association and inspected by Robertson (Baker 1970: 46).
Incredibly enough, more than three years passed after
he received the initial petition in Nashville before Leftwich,
as an individual and in his own name, received a contract to
establish a colony in Texas. He agreed to introduce 800
families in an area which included all of the Phillips survey: beginning on the west bank of the Navasota at the
crossing of the Upper Road from Bexar to Nacogdoches, the
boundaries ran west with the road to the dividing line between
the Brazos and Colorado rivers, thence along this ridge of
hills northwest to strike the Comanche Trace leading to
Nacogdoches, thence with the Trace to the Navasota and down
its meanders to the place of beginning, delimiting an area
of eight million acres.

1800-1850

71

In order to cover his expenses in Mexico, Leftwich
sold the contract to the Texas Association, which then chose
Dr. Felix Robertson as the next commissioner to superintend
the settlement of the grant. With Robertson's appointment,
events seemed at least to move ahead. By early 1826, his
party had reached the confluence of the Brazos and Little
rivers, and during February and March surveyors laid out
leagues for the Colony. By May 1826, the group had located
almost fifty leagues for about thirty-three different people,
and by a great stroke of luck had enc-0untered no Indians
even though Stephen F. Austin's reports to Mexican officials
in San Antonio mentioned past and impending Indian raids in
the area.
Perhaps Felix Robertson's worst problem lay in his relations with a somewhat mysterious settler named Early who had
squatted on land which Sterling C. Robertson wanted for himself and which later became part of the Samuel Bangs Survey
(Fig. 11 ). Early is significant because he is the first
settler known to have built a house within the Calvert Prospect.
His residence was used as a landmark in subsequent surveys
(Bangs 1835; Grafton 1855), and was located in the southern
Bangs sitio on the east side of the Little Brazos River.
Although he must have mo~ed on eventually, all early efforts
to remove him were in vain, as John P. Coles discovered in
1826 when he had to write Austin that Early intended to hold
onto his land "despite everything."
Early must have been a brave soul indeed, for Austin's
correspondence refers frequently to Indian hostilities in
the Upper Colony area. Austin had attempted to convince his
Cherokee allies to join colonists south of the Old San Antonio
Road in attacking the Waco and Tawakoni villages on the Brazos
and at the head of the Navasota, and the subsequent, unsuccessful expeditionary forces even went so far as to meet where the
Old San Antonio Road crossed the Brazos. From that point,
they headed north on the east bank of the Little Brazos,
probably passing near Early's house, and continued to the
Tawakoni village which was deserted.
Felix Robertson's letters of 1826 help one realize why
Early may have found the area west of present-day Calvert
attractive despite the threat of Indian attack. With a burst
of prophetic insight, Robertson noted that the country along
the Brazos seemed peculiarly fitted for the production of
cotton, which if well put in and attended to would yield
3,000 pounds per acre. Much of the land elsewhere in the
Colony was post-oak wood (Robertson was probably referring
here to the areas east of present-day Calvert), but there
was a much greater proportion of rich river and creek lowlands
on the Brazos than in any other country he had ever seen.

Finally, as grazing land, it was perhaps surpassed by none.
"The great variety of soil and exposure afford ample sustenance, both summer and winter, for the vast herds of
buffaloes, deer, wild horses, and cows which are to be
found in every part of the country. 11
Had he so chosen, Early would not have had much difficulty in holding onto his squatter's rights, for after
1826 relations between Mexico and settlers from the United
States had deteriorated so badly that they were at a point
of open rupture. The Republic of Fredonia had been declared
in Nacogdoches on December 16, 1826, and although the rebellion by Anglo settlers was over within a month, the new
agent for the Association, Benjamin Foster, reported that
there was not a white man left in Leftwich's Grant by the
end of 1826.
Apparently discouraged by conditions on the Brazos,
Foster returned to Nashville and was replaced as company
agent by Hosea H. League who reached Texas in April of 1827
with families he intended to settle in the Upper Colony.
Represented by Stephen F. Austin in Saltillo, he was granted
a contract on October 15, 1827, and gained official recognition as the new empresario. Even this productive step
in the Association's efforts to establish a colony was stymied,
however, for on April 6, 1830, the Mexican Congress formulated
a law which prohibited further immigration from the United
States.
Relations between Mexico and the Anglo settlers, and
between the settlers and the native Indian groups, were poor.
Those between Mexico and the Tonkawa-Wichita groups also
deteriorated. By 1830, Mexico had become concerned about
increasingly hostile Indian actions originating up the Brazos
from Austin's and League's colonies, and in that year,
Francisco Ruiz was appointed commandant of an expedition to
the Brazos to ·establish a permanent detachment on the river
so that settlers in the vicinity would have some protection
from the Indians. By July 13, 1830, an expedition of Mexican
soldiers had reached the banks of the Brazos, and by late
summer, Ruiz had found a permanent site for a post which he
elected to call Tenoxtitlan.
Although Tenoxtitlan was located south of the present
survey area, the troops who gathered there made a number of
expeditions against the Tawakoni. One left the fort and headed
north up the west bank of the Brazos to Sand Creek on August
29, 1830. On August 30, they reached Pa1s Creek and from
there traveled north towards El Salta, or the Falls of the
Brazos, where they found abandoned Tawakoni villages.
The diaries of two members of the expedition provide
excellent descriptions of the villages of Indian tribes that
had been raiding settlements in the project area. Nicacio

1800-1850

Sanches, who gave the order to burn one village, noted that
it was comprised of forty-four large houses, sixty-two
brush arbors with their corresponding log coverings, fiftynine large towers, and five forts well terrepleined with
logs and dirt. Gaspar Flores, who also kept a record of
the expedition, describes this village as comprised of
forty-four cone-shaped houses about twenty-two feet high
and thirty-nine feet wide, fifty-nine little conical houses,
each one supported by four cedar posts, sixty-two brush
arbors, and five forts for defense. Attempts by the troops
to gather corn in the fields around the village were futile
because the crop had already been harvested. But the men
were able to supply themselves with many squashes and
watermelons. Flores also noted that the party came upon
two abandoned villages, the first containing fourteen houses
and the second, forty.
While Ruiz worked to make the territory north of the Old
San Antonio Road safe for settlement, the attempts of the
Nashville Association to introduce colonists to the area
were on the verge of fruition. By June 4, 1830, Sterling
C. Robertson, last and finally successful empresario, had
entered a partnership with Alexander Thomson of Giles County,
Tennessee, to bring about 100 families to settle in the
Nashville Colony under authority of the Nashville Company.
By September 1830, he and nine other men were well on their
way to settle in Leftwich's Grant, and shortly after he
reached San Felipe de Austin where Hosea League issued a
power-of-attorney making Robertson his agent and, for all
intents and purposes, empresario of the Colony.
Although records concerning the number of families
Robertson actually introduced to Robertson County are inexact, he was responsible for the presence of at least several hundred landowners by the time of the Texas Revolution
(Baker 1970: 30). The pattern of their settlement was wellestablished within a few short years: upon arriving in the
Colony, colonists traveled first to the Falls of the Brazos
where Robertson's agent took their applications. Then,
accompanying Colony surveyors, they traveled south again
to locate their future home sites.
Farming, like settlement in the project area, occurred
on a small scale at first. Although the settlers came to
Robertson's Colony from cotton-growing areas, they were not
equipped for the enterprise. River bottoms were largely
uncleared forests where settlers feared yellow fever. Subsequently, farming tended to be on a small scale, with
residents spending most of their time clearing land, growing
corn, raising cattle and hogs, and keeping a sharp eye out
for Indians.

76

HISTORIC RESOURCES

If natural conditions and Indian raids between the
Brazos and Navasota tended to delay rapid settlement in
Robertson's Colony, the issue of clouded land titles may
also have contributed to the settlers' hesitancy to take
up new land. Despite the fact that the land requested by
Robertson clearly lay between the two rivers, the Mexican
government established a policy after 1830 of issuing its
own grants to Mexican citizens. Two of these grants -those given to J. M. Bangs and Maria de la Concepcion
Marquez -- covered land now within the Calvert and Cole
Creek prospects. The Bangs two sitios conflicted directly
with eight other grants subsequently issued by Robertson.
Bangs, best known as an early Texas printer, had petitioned for a grant from the Mexican government. 5 Citing
his extensive service as printer for the government, Bangs
requested two leagues on the Brazos River. Officials were
aware that such a grant would include lands contracted for
by the Nashville Company and advised Bangs to apply to the
current Company agent, Hosea H. League in San Felipe de
Austin. Bangs followed this advice and subsequently received
·permission from League to taKe possession of the land anywhere he chose to do so within the limits of the Colony
(Texas. General Land Office [aa. 1830]).
Because land near the Brazos River was so fertile,
conflicts with the Bangs claim were not long in arising.
The issues involved took much longer to resolve, however,
and for years after the awarding of the initial grant, lawsuits were heard in Austin as descendants of later grantees
attempted to obtain clear title from Bangs' heirs.
The cases of later claimants may have been considerably
strengthened because they, not Bangs, chose to live on their
grants. Perhaps the earliest and best-known group to obtain
land west of present-day Calvert was the Webb family, comprised of Jesse and Susan Webb and their twelve children.
Webb received his land in 1834, and four sons -- Joseph,
John, Andrew, and Thomas -- received grants in 1834 and 1835.
By 1837 they had developed large amounts of Brazos River
land, bu4 in time, remnants of the family moved east to the
uplJnds where they continued to farm.
While it still stood west of Calvert, the Jesse Webb
Home was a well-known stopping place for visitors, not unlike
the Early Home nearby. Z. N. Morrell, Tennesseean and
preacher, rode across Robertson County in December of 1835

on his way to the Falls of the Brazos where he was to meet
David Crockett on Christmas Day for a bear hunt. Crossing
the Navasota River ( 11 an ugly stream -- land on the river
all subject to overflow; must be very sickly . . . timber
consisted principally of hackberry, elm, oak, and some wild
china"}, Morrell hastened on to Jesse Webb's near the Little
Brazos where dinner consisted principally of bear bacon,
turnip greens, and fresh buffalo, and conversation of
stories about Indians in the vicinity. Game abounded and
wild rye stood over knee high in the Brazos River bottom.
But even these attractions must have seemed less desirable
as the Webbs could farm only when one party stood guard while
another ploughed (Morrell 1966: 39-41, 46).
Between Webb's and the Falls of the Brazos, Morrell saw
indications of Indian activity everywhere. Fields, perhaps
cultivated by the likes of the Fishers or Litson Purdy,
stood deserted, and Morrell speculated that the Mexicans
"were evidently encouraging all the wild tribes to exterminate
the colonists" {Morrell 1966: 42).
Attacks on the settlements below the Falls and within the
vicinity of the survey area were common, and Morrell himself
was near the area when one of the most tragic occurred. In
November of 1836, on the road from the Wheelock area to the
Falls of the Brazos, Morrell and his party were threatened
by approximately 150 Indians. Later, they encountered a group
of soldiers who reported that the Harveys, a family living
north of present-day Calvert, had been massacred {Morrell
1966: 51-52). The Harvey log home was located just north of
the present Calvert Prospect boundary, and all of the family
members were killed except for a daughter and a slave. In
1840, the daughter was located and sent to an uncle, James
Talbot, who moved to Robertson County. Talbot purchased the
former Harvey land and, on property within the Calvert
Prospect, built a home which burned only recently.
Dther Indian attacks occurred throughout the 1830's
J. M. Tidwell was killed in 1838 -- but even so, settlers
continued to come to the Colony, take up land grants, and
establish communities. One of the first was Franklin, which
started about 1835 on the headwaters of Mud Creek as a
community of surveyors (Baker 1970: 74}. On December 14,
1837, Robertson County was created out of Bexar, Milam, and
Nacogdoches counties, and shortly after, Franklin was chosen
as the county seat. First settlers were Edward McMillan,
a San Jacinto veteran, and William Love, who, in January of
1836, built a log house in the area (Baker 1970: 75).
Two other communities sprang up in or near the survey
area shortly after Franklin was founded. One was Mount
Vernon, a settled area as early as 1840, and the other was
Little Mississippi, a town whose only immediately visible

78

HISTORIC RESOURCES

remnant today is the cemetery which lies within the Cole
Creek Prospect. Both communities were founded by settlers
from Mississippi whom the panic of the 1830's drove from
their native state to more western areas. In central
·Robertson County they established small farms. Depopulation
of the two towns and the surrounding areas occurred only
after railroads were built in other parts of the county and
larger, more tmportant towns were established.
If the decade of the 1830's was one of beginning, of
the initiation of small farms and communities despite the
ever-constant threat of Indian attack, the 1840's represented
something of a transitional period. Although Indian-White
relations remained poor, raids and counterattacks occurred
less frequently. Perhaps more importantly, indications of
Robertson County's future agricultural wealth were present.
While small farms remained the norm, some new settlers such
as John Barton brought slaves with them as well as a deep
interest in the cultivation of cotton and a recognition of
the potential of the Brazos River area. The prosperity of
the 1850's was only a step away.
BOOM DAYS IN THE CALVERT AND COLE CREEK PROSPECTS
Although much agricultural development occurred in the
western portion of Robertson County with its immense cotton
plantations, all parts of the county experienced some increase
in prosperity during the latter half of the nineteenth century.
New towns were platted in both the Cole Creek and Calvert
prospects, and waves of Southern migration which occurred
after 1850 meant an increase in population and the development of previously untouched areas throughout the county.
The most noticeable changes in Robertson County occurred
in the area west of present-day Calvert. Prior to 1850,
this region was sparsely settled and only infrequently
planted in cotton. Soon after that date, however, planters
from the Deep South who had followed the Old San Antonio
Ro&d became attracted to the Brazos River. They brought
with them slaves, a knowledge of cotton growing, farm implements, seeds, and tools needed for plantation operation.
Between 1850 and 1855, the number of slaves in Robertson
County increased dramatically from 264 to 1 ,269. Equally
startlingly, the county's population grew more than fivefold, compared to a three-fold increase for the state as a
whole (Baker 1970: 129, 464).
It would be pointless to enumerate all of the plantations
which developed west of Calvert after 1850. However, a

BOOM DAYS

79

number of them -- those belonging to the Bartons, Hannas,
Townsends, Garretts, Burnitts, and Calverts -- were particularly outstanding in terms of the size and scope of their
operations. Today the remains of their plantation houses
are still visible. Similar large holdings and important
sites in the Cole Creek Prospect include the Talbot House
north of Calvert, the McMillan holdings near Owensville,
the Orviss Ranch east of Calvert, and the enormous Cole
Ranch along the Navasota River.
One of the southernmost plantations belonged to Conway
Oldham Barto~ whose home was situated between the two
prospect areas, but much of whose land lay within the Cole
Creek Prospect. Like many other planters along the Brazos,
Barton was a Southerner whose trek to Texas took many years.
He was born in Pendleton District, South Carolina, on
August 20, 1805, and married twenty-two years later in
Montgomery County, Alabama. In 1835, Barton moved west
again and by the mid-1840's he had reached Caddo Parish,
Louisiana. The family arrived in Robertson County in 1852,
{Parker 1955: 128-129) taking up land which Barton had purchased
from George W. Hill of Navarro County on September 17, 1852.
The 1,440 acres which were involved in the transaction were
part of· the John A. Hill Headright and were located on the
Brazos River (Robertson County Deeds L: 32) 6 or 7 miles
from Calvert.
In time, Barton found the Brazos bottom an unhealthy
place to live. Subsequently, he bought property on the
higher, Milam County, side of the river and built a house
near Port Sullivan. He continued to ·acquire land in
Robertson County so that by the time his estate was probated
in 1871, he owned more than 2,000 acres which were described
as Brazos bottom and uplands of post oak and musquite [sic]
prairie (Robertson County Deed Record 18: 153-167).
Barton's neighbors and relatives to the north were the
William Purnell Townsends whose plantation lands and home
were situated within the present-day Calvert Prospect.
Townsend, a native of Mississippi and participant in the
Mexican War (Parker 1955: 202-203), made his first purchase
of Brazos River land in 1854 when he was still a resident of
Loundes County, Mississippi. On May 9, he bought 677.5 acres
of the George M. G. Grafton Headright claim from William,
Nathaniel B., Joseph, John, and George Harding, beginning
at the east bank of the Brazos on the corner of a league
granted to Jesse Webb (Robertson County Deeds L: 633-634).
The purchase was ill-advised since it was part of the Bangs
Survey, and Townsend spent seven years obtaining a clear
title to the property (Robertson County Transcribed Deed
Record M: 576).
Undjscouraged, he continued to purchase
adjoining tracts throughout the 1850's and 1860's. He

HISTORIC RESOURCES

80

bought a piece of land on which William C. and Mary E.
Keesee resided (Robertson County Transaribed Deed Record
M: 584); 198.l acres on the Little Brazos from a neighbor,
James L. Hanna (Robertson County Deed Record N: 182-183};
and land in the new town of Sterling (Robertson County
Deed Record O: 12-13).
In time, Townsend moved from his plantation home, located east of the Little Brazos and north of Wildcat Road,
and leased his property. The instrument by which he leased
the plantation in January 1874 clearly delineates the land
and many of the improvements which Townsend had made to it.
He specifically rented out the land and improvements, reserving to his own use "the Carriage house, a ten foot square
Corn Crib situated West of and adjoining the Smoke House and
the Cabin now occupied by the said S. S. Townsend . . . . 11
An additional rental consideration made on December l, 1874,
mentioned the existence of a corn crib measuring twenty by
thirty-two feet, a gin house, seed room, and cotton press.
In addition, should there be an epidemic making it advisable
for Townsend to leave Calvert, the renters agreed that he
could return to the plantation and "hold and occupy the two
East rooms of the dwelling house, on said premises . . . . 11
(Robertson County Deed Reaord W: 564-565).
Townsend s wife died on November 25, 1873, and he mortgaged his interest in their 443 acres of community property
and in his own 677.Sacres (minus the 200-acre homestead) to
J. S. Mclendon & Co. Following his own daath in 1882, the
property was offered at public sale and Mclendon & Co.
obtained it. Subsequently, the Company sold the land to
Scott Field, and to J. T. Garrett who owned a plantation to
the north and later sold out to Field. Field also obtained
the interest of his brother, Harry, who had married one of
Townsend s daughters (Robertson County Deed Record 36: 442445; Parker 1955: 146-147). Today, part of what was once
the Townsend Plantation is still owned by the Field family.
One of the larger plantations in the Calvert Prospect
adjoined Townsend s land on the south and was owned by James
S. Hanna. In time, Hanna lost most of his property to the
Adove Brothers, but at the height of his prosperity he owned
more than 1 ,800 acres along the Big and Little Brazos rivers
in the Grafton Headright Survey, held a one-half interest in
the Robert Calvert Plantation, and owned about 1 ,000 acres
on the west bank of the Brazos.
Hanna appeared to have moved to Robertson County in
the mid-1850 1 s because his first purchases of land occurred
in early 1855 when he bought a total of four pieces of
property in the Grafton League (Robertson County Deeds L:
628-629, 761-762; Transcribed Deed Record M: 59-60, 126).

By early 1860 he had blocked up all of his plantation lands
near Townsend and began to expand his interests north of·
Black Bridge Road to Robert Calvert's old plantation which
he purchased with T. M. Williams from Gustave Ranger on
February 13, 1872 (Robertson County Deed Record V: 212215). The $13,750.74 amount to which he indebted himself
for the purchase of the plantation may have been too great
a financial burden, however, and as one informant noted,
the Hannas were not good business people. Hanna still owned
all of the Grafton property at the time of his death.
the heirs among whom it was divided sold much of the land
to Bertrand and Jacque Adove (Robertson County Deed Record
6: 31-34), and today what was once the large Hanna Plantation
is owned by a descendant of Jacque Adove and by the Peters
family, descendants of one of Hanna's daughters (Robertson
County Deed Record 9: 318-319; Deed Record 10: 410-411).
Although little information was found about Hanna's
life, legal records reveal that he was an enterprising and
innovative entrepreneur. With Thomas M. Williams he deeded
to the Calvert Bridge Company three acres on which the cnmpany
built a bridge across the Brazos. The location was approximately 600 yards upriver from the Calvert Brick Quarter, and
the road which ran to the bridge was near the north line of
William Burnitt's plantation (Robertson County Deed Record
Y: 355-356). On his own plantation he experimented with
Chinese labor {Robertson County Deed Record W: 707-708),
and after he ceased to farm, he leased 600 acres by means
of a document which mentioned a number of houses between
the Little and Big Brazos rivers, as well as "one double
house on the east branch of little Brazos" (Robertson County
Deed Record V: 53-54).
Although it is clear from another document that in 1874
Hanna was living between the Big and Little Brazos (Robertson
County Deed Record W: 799-800), it is tempting to identify
the "double house on the east branch of little Brazos" as
the original Hanna House. During the 1978 survey, an early
site was located east of Peters Slough, a stream which could
be identified as a branch of the Little Brazos, and its
location has been roughly equated with 200 acres identified
as the homestead tract in a partition of the real estate of
Martha A. E. Hanna (Robertson County Deed Record 5: 240-244).
Another prosperous planter, the remains of whose house
are still visible east of the Little Brazos, was J. Tom
Garrett, a native of Alabama who came to Texas and married
a daughter of Robert Calvert. His land began on the north
side of the Townsend Plantation and went north to Black
Bridge Road. From east to west, it extended from the Calvert
town limits to the Big Brazos River (Hucks 1978; Parker 1955:

82

HISTORIC RESOURCES

150). Today, most of the Garrett Plantation is part of the
Weinacht Ranch, and cattle herds have replaced the oncelarge cotton fields. Foundations.of the Garrett house
are still visible, as are those of various outbuildings
and roads which led from the plantation into Calvert.
Other s~rvivors of the long-gone Garrett Plantation
are descendants of J. T. and Pauline Garrett who married
neighbors and. fellow planters. One daughter, Mary, became
the wife of John H. Drennan, a merchant in Sterling and
Calvert; a second daughter, Lucy, married Scott Field who
obtained most of what had been the Townsend Plantation to
the south.
A smaller, but important plantation to the northwest
of the Garrett Farms was owned by William Burnitt. A native
of the area around Decatur, Alabama, Burnitt was one of the
first permanent residents of the area west of present-day
Calvert when he moved there in 1853. He settled on land
which had been originally granted to Jose M. Bangs and
obtained clear title to it in 1850 when he paid Bangs•
heirs $326.80 (Robertson County Transcribed Deed Record M:
578). The land adjoined that of Robert Calvert on the north
and was part of the John B. Webb Survey.
In 1857, Burnitt bought about 653.6 acres known as the
Bottom Tract which had been part of the Jesse J. Webb estate
(Robertson County Deed Record M: 325-326). This acreage
remained the core of Burnitt s property until his death
when it was partitioned among his wife, Lucy W., and children, Pike, Seth, and William 0. (Robertson County Deed
Record 73: 179-181). The other outstanding item in his
estate was the Little Brazos Bridge which he had built and
owned with C. P. Salter, and which his executors sold to
the county (Robertson County Deed Record 4: 10).
The most important individual holding west of Calvert,
not only because of its size, but also because of the individual
associated with it, was the Calvert Plantation. At the
height of its operations it included thousands of acres
of fertile Brazos River land which has been described as
11
the best equipped [plantation] in the county 11 (Parker
1955: 137).
One of the biggest land owners in Robertson County,
Robert Calvert was also one of the first planters to come
to the Brazos River. He was born on February 9, 1802, in
Wartrace, Tennessee, and grew up in Bibb County, Alabama.
He married Mary Keesee and lived for a time in Arkansas
where he served as a county judge (Parker 1955: 137). In
1850 he came to Robertson County, and by the time the 1850
tax rolls had been assembled, Calvert had purchased 500
acres in the John Smyth Grant on the Brazos River. He
owned eleven Negroes, twenty-five cattle, and nine horses,
1

BOOM DAYS

83

and had embarked on the enterprise which was to make him
one of Robertson County's most successful planters.
Calvert's acquisition of land, most of it in the Webb
Survey and thus also within the disputed Bangs Survey, was
rapid. In 1852 he bought about 1,307 acres of land from
the Webbs and 320 acres from Catherine Gary. In 1853, he
bought another 320 acres between the Big and Little Brazos,
and the following year, 163.5 acres from Joseph Webb. Land
purchases outside the Webb leagues included one-quarter
league on the water of the Little· Brazos and Walnut Creek
(Robertson County Deeds L: 72-73, 235-236, 402, 521; Transcribed Deed Record M: 90, 117-118).
Calvert also took an active interest in two other
western Robertson County developments. At various times,
he owned lots in the nearby town of Sterling and was a
partner in the Sterling firm of Davis, Calvert, and Hanna
(Robertson County Probate File No. 3). In 1860, the same
three partners contracted with the Houston and Texas Central
Railway Company to grade miles 100 to 125 of the railroad
bed and to furnish crossties and culverts (Robertson County
Deed Record N: 211).
Although work on the railroad ceased
because of the Civil War, the grade was ready for track
laying when construction began again during Reconstruction
{Parker 1955: 137).
Calvert's importance and stature on a county-wide scale
was reflected in his election to the Texas Legislature
between 1853 and 1860. In addition, he was a ruling elder
in the Presbyterian Church for thirty years and his family
was instrumental in the deeding and laying out of the
Sterling Cemetery and Cumberland Presbyterian Church.
Before his death, Calvert sold much of his land to the
firm of Ranger & Co. (Robertson County Deed Record O: 104106). But the inventory of his estate reveals enormous
wealth, nonetheless. Included in his holdings were 1 ,896
acres in the Joseph Webb League, 350 acres in the Jesse
Webb Grant, 150 acres in the Samuel Kinney Grant, lots in
Houston on the south side of Buffalo Bayou, and interest
in a house and lot in Marlin, Texas, and the lodge room in
the upper story of the store of Calvert and Garrett in
Sterling. Appurtenances to the real estate reveal the
extent of Calvert's prosperous plantation and the degree
to which the business must have been self-sufficient.
There were the usual mules and horses.
In addition, the
estate included 200 to 300 head of sheep, 500 head of cattle,
and 200 head of stock hogs. Industry on the plantation was
evidenced by the presence of a sawmill and fixtures. Crops
grown included cotton and corn (Robertson County Probate
File No.

3).

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Some of the once-enormous Calvert Plantation is still
owned and operated by heirs of Robert Calvert. Other
associations with the man abound throughout the western
part of the county from the house site where he lived, to
the town site and cemetery of Sterling where he is buried,
and the nearby town of Calvert which was named for him.
One of the last plantations in the Calvert Prospect
was the Talbot Farm, situated north of Calvert in the less
fertile upland area east of the Brazos River bottoms. Owned
by James Talbot, the plantation or farm actually got its
start when the Harvey Family moved to the area and built
a log home in the mid-1830's. Three family members were
massacred shortly afterward and a daughter taken into
captivity. Eventually, she was recovered by her uncle,
James Talbot of Pike County, Alabama, who moved to Robertson
County in 1853 and purchased the land the Harveys had owned.
He built a house in the Calvert Prospect only a short distance from the Harvey log home and established a plantation
which his son, Romanus Talbot, continued to manage. Remains of the Talbot Home, described by an informant as a
raised cottage, are still clearly visible, the structure
having burned little more than a decade ago.
The Townsend, Hanna, Garrett, Burnitt, Calvert, and
Talbot plantations were among the most important in the
Calvert Prospect area. In most cases, the remains or
sites of the plantation homes which were associated with
them are easily identifiable, for land ownership in the
Calvert Prospect has been a conservative matter; many large
landholdings have remained in the possession of descendants
Of the original owners since the 1850 s.
Land ownership and the identification of house sites
in the Cole Creek Prospect is an entirely different matter.
With a few exceptions, individual holdings, although dating
from a period equivalent to those in the Calvert Prospect,
were much smaller. Furthermore, land was bought and sold
with greater frequency, thus making the location of the
house sites more difficult to accomplish and once located,
more difficult to identify with any one family.
The cataloguing of the bulk of historic sites within
the Cole Creek Prospect is a monumental task which would
require a thorough surveying of the prospect area. A number
of located holdings and sites are worth mentioning, however. 6

The Orviss, Love, McMillan, and Cole holdings are
discussed not because they are typical of the Cole Creek
Prospect, but because their size and the fact they have
remained in the possession of one family over an extended
period made them more feasible research subjects.

Immediately east of Calvert is a large land holding
which has remained a contiguous piece of property since
December 1834. On that date, George Robertson, as a member
of the Nashville Colony, received from the Mexican government a league situated on Walnut Creek about six miles
from the Brazos River. There is no indication that he
ever lived on the property, for barely two months later
he deeded it to James Dunn, Sr., who in 1850 deeded it to
his son, James Dunn, Jr. (Robertson County Deed Record U:
521-522; Deed Record 59: 462).
The first known occupant of the property was Davis
Orviss, who purchased one-half interest in the 2,200 acres
in 1873 from Thomas M. and M. E. Johnstone, the latter
being one of the two surviving heirs of James Dunn, Jr.
Orviss then began to operate the property as a ranch, and
ten years later succeeded in buying the other one-half
interest from Johnstone as well (Robertson County Deed
Record W: 353; Deed Record 72: 217).
Unlike much of the rest of eastern Robertson County
land, the Orviss tract remained intact through almost onehalf dozen transactions (Robertson County Deed Record 59:
462; Deed Record 6?: 136; Deed Record 774: 187-188). In
addition, its function has remained constant, and today it
is use~ for cattle raising just as it was when it was owned
by the Orviss Family.
Two other land holdings in the Cole Creek Prospect date
from the same period as the Robertson League, and a further
search for the location of sites associated with them may
reveal the house remains of two of Robertson County's
earliest and most important settlers. One is that of
David H. Love, who was granted eight-and-one-third labors
on the east side of the Brazos north of the San Antonio
Road in 1845 (Robertson County Transcribed Deed Record M:
95-96), and who subsequently gave part of the land for the
town of Owensville, third county seat. The second is that
of Ann McMillan whose 1838 grant was located on Walnut Creek
next to David Love's land (Robertson County Deed Record 56:
313), and whose house may have been situated within the
northern boundaries of the Cole Creek Prospect.
A study of one last land holding in the Cole Creek
Prospect reveals why sites in other portions of the prospect
area may be difficult to identify. Like most other grants,
the Maria de la Concepcion Marquez Grant was a single large
piece of land given to one individual. Within twenty-five
years of the granting, however, the original eleven leagues
had been subdivided by speculators into dozens of smaller
holdings owned by individuals, some of whom lived on their
land, and some of whom only held it for speculation. Its
reassembling into one large ranch was a process which took

HISTORIC RESOURCES

86

almost 100 years and involved the purchasing of literally
scores of small individual holdings.
The Marquez Grant was one of roughly one-half dozen
which were made by the Mexican government in Robertson
County. Comprised of eleven leagues, the land was given in
1833 to Maria de la Concepcion Marquez, wife of Eduardo de
Turneau de Linieres, both of Mexico City. In a grant which
took as one of its landmarks "el camino nuevo de los Indios
Qu1chais [Kichaes], 11 Marquez assumed ownership of a tremendous amount of land which began about twenty-miles north
of W~eelock and stretched along the west side of the
Navasota River (Texas. General Land Office: various dates b).
It is doubtful that Marquez ever intended to use the
land for anything other than speculative purposes, for on
August 10, 1836, her attorney, Maximilian Chabert, was in
New York City. His purpose was to sell Marquez's land, and
to this end he appointed James Treat of New York City the
attorney for Marquez and empowered him to sell the grant
(Robertson County Deed Record J: 40-41).
On August 25, 1836, Treat was successful in carrying
out Marquez's wishes when he sold her eleven leagues to
James Fortune, a part-time resident of Texas. Fortune
retained the property for nine years, after which he sold
it to James Morgan of New Washington, Texas, who, in turn,
sold it to Alexander H. Dana of New York City on November 22,
1848 (Robertson County Deeds T: 45-46; Transcribed Deed
Record D: 358; Deed Record P: 18-20).
At this point, the ownership and distribution of the
lands within the Marquez Grant became more and more complicated. Apparently hoping to turn a quick profit himself,
Dana appointed David Ayres of Galveston as his attorney and
directed him to manage the Marquez Grant. Ayres was also
acting as agent for a group called the Navasota [sic]
Association 1 whose members, Marcena Munson, Samuel Swartwout,
and Mrs. Maris Mead of New York City, and David Ayres of
Texas, had obtained a beneficial interest in the Grant
(Robertson County Deed Record J: 1-3, 115-121, 164-165).
By 1855, the Association members agreed to divide the grant
among themselves, each party receiving certain sections
and releasing all claims to the other sections (Robertson
County Deeds L: 727-728).
7

The Navasota Association is mentioned nowhere in
standard reference texts and never filed incorporation
records with the State of Texas. Its further investigation
would make an interesting, if only academic, pursuit.

BOOM DAYS

87

Ayres had surveyed the grant in 1852, dividing it into
a multitude of 640-acre tracts. On the map which resulted
from his work, he also drew in land owned by a number of
individuals, among whom were William E. Bedford, John 0.
Thompson, James Thompson, John Wood, James Striker, M. Graves,
0. W. Brattin, M. C. Henderson, G. W. Folley, D. L. Wood,
S. Peany (?), H. 0. Langford, W. Shicker, W. R. Graves,
and two individuals named Perkins and Owens. It is impossible
at this point to determine from the plat whether any of
these individuals were living on their property in 1852,
although the existence of streams named for them, such as
"John Thompson's Spring Branch," "Bedford's Branch," and
"Folley's Branch" strongly suggest that possibility
(Robertson County Deeds L: 732).
Although some writers have noted that the portion of
Robertson County located within the Cole Creek Prospect
was all but devoid of settlement throughout the mid-nineteenth
century, it seems unlikely that at least those more desirable
parts of the Marquez Grant -- along Duck Creek, for example
-- were not taken up, particularly by immigrants who came
to the area after the Civil War. Certainly, by the l870's
significant portions of the area must have been the location
of small farms and homesteads.
One post-Civil War immigrant, Robert Cole, made a practice of buying up such farms and homesteads. Described by
a relative as an "unregenerate Rebel" (Taylor 1978), Cole
settled in the northeastern portion of Robertson County and
established a prosperous, thriving, farming and ranching
business.
Cole was a native of Mississippi who served in the Civil
War in the Virginia Campaign. Following the War, he had
aspirations of joining other Confederates in Mexico but
got no further than Calvert. In 1872, he married Margaret
Graham whose father had served in the Texas Revolution and
who was raised by the Henderson Family. A relative noted
that he was the adventurer and she the saver, a combination
of personal traits which resulted in their purchasing literally dozens of pieces of land. Among their accumulations
were a one-third interest in 320 acres on Duck Creek in 1874,
114 acres on Duck Creek in 1881, 50 acres near the Blatherwick Survey and one-third interest in 200 acres of the John
Reed League in 1885, 100 acres in the Reed League in 1886,
more land on Duck Creek in 1894 and 1899, and 80 acres in
the Marquez Grant in 1902 (Robertson County Deed Record Z:
242; Deed Record 11: 223; Deed Record 13: 356; Deed Record
14: 404, 447; Deed Record 16: 461; Deed Record 2?: 606-608;
Deed Record 40: 150, 566; Deed Record 41: 352-354).
The
list of the Coles' acquisitions could go on, but the sum
total of their years of purchases was a sizeable piece of

88

HISTORIC RESOURCES

property along the Navasota River and Duck Creek, and south
of Bald Prairie.
Interviews with relatives and descendants of the Robert
Coles resulted in the identification of a number of sites in
the Cole Creek Prospect area, and of families who might be
associated with such sites (Cole 1978). One of the older
sites connected with the Cole Family itself was the first
Cole House, located east of present-day Highway 2096 and
south of the residence of a neighbor, Tommy Johnson. About
ten years later, the family moved to another-home which they
occupied until its destruction around 1938-1939. Located
on land presently owned by Miller B. Martin, this second
Cole home was a large log dogtrot with shed rooms in back
and a fireplace on the east side. A commissary was located
about 150 yards east of the house.
By the time the second generation of the Cole Family had
acquired most of their land, they owned extensive holdings
along the Navasota River and west and southwest along Duck
and Mineral creeks. Much of the land was in contiguous
pieces, but some 600-odd acres were located where North
Mineral and Mineral creeks came together. This parcel was
separate from the rest of the ranch and had once been the
county farm. During Cole ownership, there were three to
four houses located in the area along North Mineral Creek.
There were a number of individuals who built houses or
owned land near Cole property. The Brown Place was located
near the intersection of Steele Creek and the Navasota River.
Nearby, on the Navasota, a man named Hancock ran a sawmill
from about 1936 to 1938.. And west,southwest of the Brown
tKJuse was property owned by the Hagers at one time and
subsequently by the Coles.
Three more land owners were situated to the southwest,
west, and northwest of Hager. To the southwest was the
Perkins Place; west was the Joe Boring Place, just southeast
of the present Bert Wheeler headquarters; and northwest was
the land owned by Corbett Elledge.
In the vicinity of the present-day Wheeler Home was
land owned by an individual named Duval, and the land nearby
was called the Sand Hills. The Vanderford Place may have
been directly north; west was the Coal Branch Schoolhouse.
Between Highway 2096 and the eastern project boundary
was Hopkin Head Pasture, while west, along Duck Creek and
Highway 2096 was another series of isolated sites. A descendant recalls that there was a burial south of Duck Creek
on the west side of Highway 2096. Directly south of the
burial was a Negro cemetery where members of the Richards
Family were interred adjacent to a Negro church. Further
south still, was the Gilmore Home Place. East, across

BOOM DAYS

89

Highway 2096, was land owned by the Brown Family, and southeast, near the project boundary, was the Richardson Place,
in operation by the 1930's and partly owned by an individual
named Cecil Reagan.
The south line of the Cole Ranch lay near the Brown
and Gilmore home places on land now owned by the Walter
Mischer Ranches. Thus, land to the south and west of the
main Cole Ranch was owned by other interests such as the
George Phillips Family which operated in a large area west
of Highway 2096. The Puckett Fami·ly owned approximately
l ,500 acres west of Mineral Creek, acquired from an individual
named Horton and subdivided about ten years ago into small
farms.
Finally, the Coles had some Black neighbors. One was
an individual named Robertson who lived on North Mineral
Creek. Another was Dave Richards (also spelled Ritchard),
an ex-slave to whom, in 1904, the governor of Texas granted
160 acres near the south line of the Cole Ranch (Robertson
County Deed Record 48: 271). A number of Black families also
owned small holdings between Mineral Creek (the Puckett
property) and Owensville.
While they lived west of the Navasota, the Cole Family
raised cattle and hogs extensively. Some of the farming
was done by tenants who lived on the property. The Coles
themselves ran hogs in the river and creek bottoms and
drove their cattle to Kosse for rail shipment. They figured about one cow for every twenty acres on land that was
mostly fenced and considerably more open and free from
undergrowth than it is today. Hands could run cattle through
the area easily, unhampered by the yaupon that has grown up
in more recent years.
By and large, the Cole Family was self-sufficient.
Robert Cole supposedly had a cotton gin on a small branch
south of the second, log Cole Home. The family ran a steam
sawmill and a sugar mill on Duck Creek, the latter processing
the large amounts of ribbon cane grown on the ranch. As a
result of these various industries, trips for household
necessities were made to Calvert only twice a year.
The Coles enjoyed general prosperity through World War
I when they invested heavily in cattle. However, after the
War the market collapsed (Taylor 1978) and with the Depressio~ family fortunes declined considerably.
Much land was
sold to a Dr. Riley of Battle Creek, Michigan, who gave it
to the Jehovah's Witnesses. Bert Wheeler later purchased
it. Some land along the Navasota River was sold to Roger
Benchley of Marquez. The northeastern part of the ranch,
about 570 acres near Rough Bear Lake, was sold to John Henry
Whatley in the l930's.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Approximately 4,000 acres of land along Duck Creek
was sold in 1938 to the Dr. Hooper Ranch Company of Conroe,
Texas. Eventually, after a series of transactions, the
property ended up in the ownership of Miller B. Martin and
Walter Mischer, Mischer owning the southern portion of the
acreage which is actually within the Cole Creek Project
area.
Because of the fact that vast amounts of land were owned
by the Cole Family, there were few other residents in the
northeastern part of the survey area. Virtually no one lived
along the Navasota itself, or between the Cole property and
land east of Owensville. As a result, population centers
were in the vicinity of Bald Prairie and west near Boone
and Grant prairies.
TOWNS IN THE PROSPECT AREAS:
STERLING, TIDWELL PRAIRIE, AND OWENSVILLE
Farms and plantations and the house sites associated
with them represent one kind of historical resource. Another
important resource is in the form of complete town sites,
and the Cole Creek and Calvert prospects contain four such
sites, the three most important being Sterling, Tidwell
Prairie, and Owensville. Two of these sites -- Sterling and
Owensville -- are especially important because they were
among the first formal communities in the county. They
were commercial centers, and one -- 8 Owensville -- was the
county seat prior to the Civil War.
Sterling, located on the east side of the Little Brazos
on land now owned by the Gibson Family, was one of the
earliest commercial headquarters for the plantation families
located along the Brazos River. It was named for Sterling
C. Robertson, and by the 1850's had three saloons, a blacksmith shop, two livery stables, a post office, two churches,
a Masonic Lodge, and several general stores. The 1860
United States census lists seventy-eight households in the
vicinity of the town; some of the more outstanding residents
were Robert Calvert, William Townsend, J. D. Herndon, the
Webbs, Charles P. Salter, and Joseph A. Foster.
Some individuals actually lived and worked in Sterling,
following such occupations as carpentry, cabinet making,

is taken from Galloway 1975: 8-11, 16-23.

EARLY TOWNS

91

sewing, merchandising, wagon making, grocery selling, and
blacksmithing. J. S. Mclendon operated the largest store
in town, while John H. Drennan, who arrived in 1858, purchased a lot and storehouse in Sterling some eight years
later. It was situated between a white storehouse formerly
occupied by Robert Calvert and J. T. Garrett and the storehouse of Kelly, Handy and Company (Robertson County Deed
Record 0: 99).
Another famous Sterling business was a store owned by
Jared Steele. The building was a generai meeting place
where Joe Foster and A. H. Allen joined with Steele to
practice the musical numbers they played for local dances
and celebrations. Steele's business was in operation until
the 1870's when he died and was buried beside his wife in
the Sterling Cemetery.
At its height, Sterling was the most prominent freight
station north of the Old San Antonio Road, center for a
cotton trade that saw thousands of bales shipped from the
great Brazos River plantations. It was the focal point for
the business and social life of surrounding planters and
cattlemen, and the location of dances and camp meetings.
The Masonic Lodge drew on members from around the area and
was one of the first such organizations in Robertson County,
Sterling thrived during the 1850's and 1860's and the
townspeople hoped that approaching railroads would insure
the permanence of the village. But the location of rail
lines two miles east of Sterling and the building of Calvert
sealed its doom. As at the coastal town of Texana, community leaders moved not only their families to Calvert, but
homes and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church as well.
Sterling's decline was irreversible and permanent by the
1870's.
A second important Robertson County town met a fate
similar to Sterling's. Located in the geographical center
of the county, Owensville had the distinction of being the
third county seat and site of the oldest and largest cemetery in Robertson County.
Owensville began in 1854 when Judge Samuel B. Killough,
responding to demands to move the county seat to a more
convenient location than Wheelock, instructed commissioners
to obtain a donation of land for the purpose of platting a
new headquarters. Land belonging to David Love was chosen,
and Love generously offered the necessary acreage to the
commissioners. Located in a largely uninhabited part of
the county, the future site of Owensville was about four
miles north of present-day Franklin and about eight miles
east of Sterling.
By November 1855, A. L. Brigance had been awarded the
contract to build the county's third courthouse, a structure

92

HISTORIC RESOURCES

that was to be a wooden building two stories high and
forty feet square, resting on four oak blocks to a side
with a row of blocks down the center. Stairs were to be
located on the outside of the building.
Almost one year later, on October 15, 1856, a jail
was completed and accepted. Originally located on land
belonging to the Maris Family, the structure was built by
James Grant and Alexander Calvert. As contracted for, it
measured fourteen by eighteen feet, had an iron door entrance, and a second story measuring eight by ten feet,
nailed down with forty penny spikes (Fig. 13).
Within a year of the opening of the courthouse, Owensville' s first residents moved to the new town. These
included Harrison Owen, for whom the town had been named;
Ann McMillan, who owned a grant of land near Owensville;
and the families of 0. M. Addison, Alexander Calvert,
Robert Crawford, C. D. Little, J. S. Parish, and J. T.
Young, to name but a few.
Various professions were soon represented as well.
J. T. Perkins and his wife operated a general mercantile
store, as did the family of Sheriff M. L. Clay. Among the
six physicians in practice at one time or another were Dr.
Belvedere Brooks, a native of Tennessee, and Dr. J. M. Moore.
Within a short time, Owensville had become not only
the legal center of Robertson County, but the educational
center as well. Two schools flourished; the one bestremembered is the Owensville Academy which had twenty-four
students by 1858 and so qualified as the largest school in
the county. A former student described the Academy as a
frame building of four large rooms where four teachers taught
writing, spelling, reading, arithmetic, geography, history,
grammar, music, and Latin. The school's fame was such that
some families moved in from outlying communities such as
Mount Vernon so that their children could attend (St. Clair
1931: 168-169).
Owensville remained a hub of countywide activity through
the Civil War period when companies were raised by William
P. Townsend, K. Smith, N. P. Richardson, and S. B. Killough.
However, the end of the War and the beginning of Reconstruction signaled the beginning of the end for Owensville, as
a hatred of the carpetbagger-scalawag regime there turned
the county's residents against procedures emanating from
the county seat. The extension of the Houston and Texas
Central Railway line to Calvert in 1868 further deteriorated
Owensville's former prestige and it was bypassed by the
important commercial enterprises of the post-Civil War period.
Owensville, like Sterling, soon lost its population and its
buildings. It ceased to function as the county seat in 1870.

EARLY TOWNS

93

With the failure of Owensville, some residents bought
land in the north-central part of the county in what became
known as Tidwell Prairie. Named for an early resident of
Robertson County who was killed by Indians in 1838,
Tidwell Prairie came to be populated by members of the
Rushing, Hailey, Weaver, Stevenson, and Rehberg families.
Some of the earliest settlement in the vicinity occurred
in the early 1870 1 s and 1880's when Anthony Weaver purchased a number of tracts in the Trudoe League (Robertson
County Deed Record N: 806; Deed Record W: 566; Deed Record
8: 244-246, 484-485; Deed Record 9: 16-17).
By 1880, the
community of which Weaver was a part had a school, church,
grist mill, cotton gin, and store.
The farming families who comprised Tidwell Prairie
formed a loosely organized community which worked, played,
and worshipped together. They were cattlemen and farmers
whose main crops were cotton and corn. On the whole, they
were independent, self-reliant individuals who developed a
strong sense of loyalty to their community and neighbors
(Baker 1970: 436-439; Weaver 1978).
If the construction of a railroad resulted in the
depopulation of Sterling and Owensville, the Depression
and a changing economy had a similar effect on Tidwell
Prairie. In time, cotton ceased to be the main crop and
while some families managed a successful conversion to
ranching, others were unable to make the change. Neighbors
moved to nearby towns such as Bremond and only a few families
were left on Tidwell Prairie by the 1970 1 s.
CHANGING TIMES: THE POST-CIVIL WAR PERIOD
The history of Calvert and Cole Creek prospects after
1865, like the fifteen years before, was comprised of several
decades of great change and general prosperity. The effects
of the Civil War on Robertson County were disastrous. Railroad construction which had been initiated prior to the Civil
War was halted, and the Confederacy's steady drain on men and
supplies left the county a depressed area. Disorder spread,
schools closed, and farms were neglected. By 1866, the economic
condition was at its lowest point.
Although Reconstruction dealt Robertson County a hard
blew (as it did all cotton-dependent economies), the population
did recover as railroads made their way across the county. In
addition, various minerals were discovered and exploited, and
cotton, one of the valley's greatest resources, continued to
contribute to a boom economy until it was replaced in large
part by other crops and by cattle.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Impetus for recovery came in the form of railroads,
and by 1867 the general population learned that the Houston
and Texas Central Railway Company had resumed construction
in Central Texas. Tracks were extended into Robertson
County in 1868 and in the same year plans were afoot to
plat a new town, Calvert. City lots were laid out and
the town soon attracted new inhabitants from the Brazos
bottoms, the declining towns of Sterling, Owensville, and
Little Mississippi, as well as the countryside between
Calvert and the Navasota River.
There is no doubt that railroad building had the greatest effect in the late nineteenth century on settlement
within the prospect areas. However, the discovery and
exploitation of a natural resource -- coal -- within the
Calvert Prospect also stimulated economic growth in the
western part of the county.
Edwin Dumble has noted that the presence of immense beds
of coal in the banks of the Big and Little Brazos was described as early as 1840 by Dr. Francis Moore, Jr. However,
development of the resources occurred only in the late
nineteenth century when ready railroad transportation
existed in the form of the main line through Calvert and
feeder lines west to the Brazos.
Calvert Bluff, where brown coal could be seen in seams
aggregating eighteen feet in a deposit extending almost a
mile up and down the Brazos, was only one of eight main
locations where lignite was being mined. Businesses such
as the Texas Coal Company, Swift and Company, and Southwestern Fuel and Manufacturing Company operated at Calvert
Bluff and on Beck's Prairie on the north side of the John
Fisher Headright where there was a sixty-foot shaft. By
1892, about 300 tons of coal had been mined from a surface
opening on the Little Brazos while other deposits of brown
coal overlaid by .red sandstone were believed to occur in
the Owensville neighborhood (Dumble 1892: 19, 20, 174-175;
Mccrary 1978).
Coal was only one resource which contributed to Robertson County's general condition of prosperity. Another
resource was cotton which continued to be the mainstay
not only of the great plantations west of Calvert, but
of the more rural, small farms between Calvert and the
Navasota River. However, with the Depression and the
initiation of various governmental controls, cotton cultivation received a severe economic blow. Those who could
change to ranching did, and small farms which once grew
cotton were combined into ranches. Central Robertson
County had experienced yet one more change in economy and
patterns of land ownership.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

99

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The radical shifts in population and economy which have
occurred in central Robertson County over the last 200 years
have all but obliterated much of the historical resource
which once existed in the two prospect areas. Formerly
the location of plantation homes, complete towns, and early
homesteaders 1 cabins, the territory in the project survey
now gives little indication in the -form of standing structures of the rich resource it once contained. Towns and
houses have disappeared, and now cemeteries such as those
at Owensville are frequently the only indication of the
large populations which once inhabited parts of a now sparsely
settled countryside.
On the basis of a very limited survey, and dealing only
with the period from the l820 1 s, it is possible to discern
two broad settlement patterns within the Calvert and Cole
Creek prospects. Both prospects were settled at about the
same time by members of Robertson's Colony, and earliest
sites such as those around Mud Creek and along the Little
Brazos should be fairly similar up to the 1850's. However,
certain qualities soon began to distinguish the eastern from
the western part of the county, and after 1850, the western
area, between Calvert and the Brazos River, was the more
prosperous. Settled and developed by wealthy planters, sites
within this portion of both the Calvert and Cole Creek
prospects which date after 1850 should reflect a Deep South,
cotton culture economy.
About the same period, the eastern portion of the two
prospects was largely inhabited by less prosperous, Upper
South farmers. Landholdings were smaller than those near
the Brazos, and the economy was more of a subsistence type,
even though some of the same crops, such as cotton, were
raised in both locations. House sites in both prospects
commonly were situated on rises and in higher elevations
where residences were positioned to avoid flooding and to
take advantage of prevailing breezes.
A preliminary survey of an area the size of the Calvert
and Cole Creek prospects can only hope to outline trends,
delineate settlement patterns, and suggest further work that
needs to be done in the course of a more comprehensive survey.
An assessment of recorded and unrecorded sites, as listed
in Tables III through VII, and illustrated in Figure 15.
reveals that some work is of strictly archeological nature,
while other sites demand an architectural treatment by a
qualified professional. Following is a list of specific
sites which deserve mitigation, as well as an enumeration

100

Figure 14 ·'

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Jericho Church

Presently located on land owned by the Anderson
Family, Jericho Church and its associated cemetery probably date from the 1850's. It began as a White church,
used by the nearby Talbot and other families, such as
the Briggs. More recently, it was used by the Black
community.
Measuring about forty feet in length and twenty-eight
feet in width, the church is a braced-frame structure that
rests on massive red sandstone footings approximately
three feet square and three courses high. The perimeter
beam is a hand-adzed piece of lumber measuring eleven by
eleven inches. Intermediate beams are logs which are
mortised into the perimeter beam. Some alterations appear
to have been made to Jericho Church: a steeple on the front
has been removed and the front door may once have been
twice as wide as it is today (Freeman 1978).

102

HISTORIC RESOURCES

of areas that need further surveying and in-depth assessment. It should not be assumed that the current list of
significant sites and structures is complete since it is
based on a very small sample of the two survey areas.
However, the list, together with the sites described in
the tables, can be assumed to be typical of the range of
sites which might be encountered and recorded in the course
of a more thorough surve~.
Sites which are basically archeological in nature,
where no standing structures still exist, but·which should
be tested to determine their potential for yielding information, include:
l. Owensville Townsite, location of the third seat of
Robertson County. Together with Sterling, Owensville was
the economic, political, and educational center for the
county from the 1850 1 s through the Civil War period. The
site has received a Texas Historical Marker from the Texas
Historical Commission.
2. Sterling Townsite, economic center for eastern
Robertson County prior to the Civil War and religious and
social gathering place for most Brazos River planters. It
was the predecessor to modern-day Calvert, the construction
of which resulted in the demise of Sterling. Several buildings, such as the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, were moved
to Calvert from Sterling.
3. Early Home, located on the Little Brazos River,
could perhaps be found by a careful use of records from the
Spanish Archives in the General Land Office coupled with
archeological surveying. Dating from the mid-1820 1 s, this
house represents the earliest-known permanent Anglo structure
in the Calvert Prospect, and may be the earliest in Robertson
County.
4. Webb Home, located on the Little Brazos, could also
possibly be found by using early land records. The house
dates from the mid-1830 s and appears to have been an important meeting place for settlers and travelers north of
the Old San Antonio Road. It is described at length in
Morrell 1 s Flowers and Fruits in the Wilderness.
1

5. Ann McMillan Home, probably situated northwest of
the Owensville Townsite, was one of the earliest settlements
in eastern Robertson County. Heirs still own some of the
McMillan land and might be able to assist in locating the
house site.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

103

6. Old house sites in the Cole Creek Prospect have
been only summarily surveyed, both in the field and in the
archives. Although parts of the prospect are known to
have been settled in the 1830's and 1840's, no sites dating
from that period have been found. The entire area, especially the territory adjacent to Mud Creek and South Walnut
Creek and in the vicinity of such early settlements as
Mount Vernon and Little Mississippi, needs to be 1 more
thoroughly searched for early house sites. In addition,
all historic sites already located- but not recorded by the
archeological field crew in the Cole Creek Prospect should
be visited by an historical archeologist. Finally, the
assistance of Dr. Malcolm Mclean, author of the multi-volumed
study of Robertson's Colony, should be enlisted in locating
the sites of houses which might have been built by members
of the Colony.
7. The Calvert Brick Quarter, mentioned in Robertson
County Deed Record Y: 355-356, was located south of Black
Bridge. While it may prove difficult, if not impossible,
to find, the Quarter might prove to be an interesting nineteenth-century industrial site.
8. A cemetery on the William Burnitt Plantation is
mentioned in Deed Record N: 465, of Robertson County. It
is unclear whether or not the cemetery was ever used, but
state laws and the Texas Antiquities Code require that all
such sites be protected. One cemetery, at Sterling, has
received a Texas Historical Marker from the Texas Historical
Commission.
9. A number of other cemeteries and single graves
exist in both the Calvert and Cole Creek prospects. These
appear in Tables III to VII and must be dealt with according
to provisions outlined in Bryant and Parmalee 1976.
10. A number of plantation house sites dating from the
1850's are significant either because they are in such excellent condition or because they are associated with significant figures in Texas history. The Talbot House site is in a
virtually undisturbed state. The Calvert House site was
the home of one of Robertson County's wealthiest planters,
the man for whom the town of Calvert was named. The Townsend
House site was the home of a wealthy planter who raised a
militia company at Owensville in 1861 and fought in the Civil
War. An acquaintance who visited Townsend on his plantation
after the War was the famous Confederate general, Jubal
Early. All of these sites, especially the Calvert site with
its attendant slaves' quarters and other outbuildings, should

104

HISTORIC RESOURCES

be tested by an historical archeologist.
11. Slaves' quarters are associated with all the preCivil War plantations and should be tested where identified.
Only one such site, on the Calvert Plantation, has been
located to date.
12. Further work n~eds to be done towards identifying
historic Indian sites in the Calvert and Cole Creek prospects.
While no sites were located in the 1978 survey which could
be positively identified as Tonkawa or Wichita in affiliation, the presence of these groups in the survey area has
been documented in the historical accounts.
Sites which are architectural in nature, where standing
structures still exist, and which should be recorded according to Historic American Buildings Survey specifications
include:
1. Jericho Church (Fig. 14) is a structure probably
dating from the l850's, or possibly earlier, and thought to
have been constructed for the Talbot and neighboring fami1 ies. At a later time it was used by the Black community.
The church is in excellent condition.
2. Owensville Jail (Fig. 12b) is a log structure built
in 1856 and now owned by the Robertson County Historical
Commission whose members intend to restore it. The original
location of the jail also lies within the Cole Creek Prospect area. Archeological investigations of the site could
produce information which might be used in the structure's
restoration.

1

3. All log structures within the two survey areas
should be assessed. While Terry Jordan's survey of log
buildings in Texas included an examination of Robertson
County, the study is clearly inadequate since only the Cavitt
House in Wheelock is mentioned. Remaining structures, such
as the set of fine single and double log cribs east of
Tidwell Prairie (Fig. 13} should be recorded and the records
submitted to the Log Cabin Register, North Texas State
University, Denton, Texas.
During the mid to late nineteenth century, Robertson
County was one of Texas' most prosperous areas, second only,
perhaps, to Harrison County. Today its prosperity is
demonstrated in the Victorian architectural masterpieces
still standing in Calvert. However, the earlier nineteenthcentury predecessors to those structures still exist in
