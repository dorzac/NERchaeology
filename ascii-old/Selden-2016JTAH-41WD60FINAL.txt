3D Scan Data for Caddo Ceramic Vessels from
41WD60 in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Collections
Robert Z. Selden Jr.1, 2 *
Abstract
In February of 2015, 19 Caddo burial vessels in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Collections were scanned (3D)
using a ZScanner 700CX running VXElements 4.1 via the scanner direct control function in Geomagic Design X
2015.2.0. These data will be used in a research design aimed at the 3D geometric morphometric analysis of
Caddo burial vessels. Post-processing of these data occurred in Geomagic Design X, and quality control for
missing data leveraged both Geomagic Design X and Geomagic Verify. In addition to the 3D morphometrics
study, these data can augment a wide variety of digital humanities and archaeological projects.

Southern Methodist University (SMU) at the request of the
Wood County Historical Society and Director Mr. Eddie
Spacek [1]. Some of the fragmented vessels were reconstructed by Mr. Robbie Spacek prior to donating the collection
of vessels to the Governor Hogg Shrine Museum [1]. The
vessel collection, along with the sherds, points and human
remains [1] then made their way from Wood County, to the
Governor Hogg Shrine Museum, then to the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department.

1. Overview
The Lake Quitman Burial Site (41WD60) vessels were excavated by Ned Woodall and another unknown student from

Figure 1. Location of the Lake Quitman Burial Site
(41WD60) in the Southern Caddo Area.

The collection includes 19 whole or reconstructed Caddo
vessels [1]. Of those, 15 are carinated bowls, and four are
jars [1]. Fourteen of the carinated bowls are Ripley Engraved

vessels of two different sizes [1, Figure 3a-e]; the other has an
inverted rim, and resembles Womack Engraved [1]. The occurrence of pendant triangle motifs in these vessels points toward
a potential late Titus Phase component (ca. A.D. 1600+) at
the site [1].
A preliminary synthesis of vessel form and type can be
accomplished through generating a network extrapolated from
qualitative attributes reported elsewhere [1], where the various nodes are scaled proportional to the number of samples
associated with each (Figure 3). While additional networkbased analyses are currently underway, this graph illustrates
the contributions of the various Caddo vessel forms and types
present at 41WD60.

(even those not intact or reconstructed [1]) were used to
generate this graph.

to articulate with the Titus Phase of the Late Caddo period (ca.
A.D. 1450-1680) in East Texas [1].

2. Methods
1.1 Context
Aside from the site location, there is no contextual information
available for the vessels recovered from 41WD60. Of the
recovered vessels, many (14) are Ripley Engraved carinated
bowls, and one is a Womack Engraved inverted rim bowl;
both are suggestive of a Titus Phase mortuary assemblage [1].
1.2 Spatial Coverage
Wood County, Texas
1.3 Temporal Coverage
There are a total of three radiocarbon dates available for
41WD60 that have been previously reported [1] and were
recalibrated [2] (Figure 4) using IntCal13. The site is thought

All data were collected with a Creaform GoSCAN50 running
VXElements 4.0 via the scanner direct control function in
Geomagic Design X 2015.2.0. Upon completion of scanning
each vessel, the texture (color) layer was removed pursuant to
guidance by the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma that no texture
data be made publicly accessible without the express written
permission of the Tribe. The uniform color scans were saved
as an ASCII.ply prior to post-processing [3, 4].
2.1 Steps
To align each scan, a reference vector (revolving axis) was
inserted, followed by a reference point at the confluence of
the vector and the mesh (using a projection) at the central
base. Region groups were then used to define the basal plane.

3D Scan Data for Caddo Ceramic Vessels from 41WD60 in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Collections — 3/5

All three elements (vector, point and plane) of reference geometry were then utilized for an interactive alignment, with
the reference plane as the moving plane, the reference vector
as the moving vector, and the reference point as the moving
point (Figure 5). Alignment has proven to be an important
factor in downstream analyses, particularly when making the
transition from Design X and Control to SolidWorks or other
CAD-based platform [5, 6].

Figure 5. Aligned 3D mesh of TPWD 41WD60 1976.31.4
illustrating the reference geometry (reference vector, points
and planes) used in the geometric morphometric analysis.

Post-processing of each 3D mesh began with the healing wizard function in Design X, which corrects problematic
issues with non-manifold poly-vertices, folded poly-faces,
dangling poly-faces, small clusters, small poly-faces, nonmanifold poly-faces, crossing poly-faces, and small tunnels.
While the settings for each of these can be customized, the default settings were used in this instance. Once post-processing
was complete, all meshes were decimated by 50 percent prior
to saving each as an ASCII.ply. Decimation of the mesh
decreases file size while increasing ease of use on standard
computers.
A digital photograph of each vessel was collected with
a Sony RX1R camera, then saved as a .jpeg, which appears
alongside each 3D mesh. Since dissemination of the texture
file for the 3D mesh is prohibited by the Caddo Nation of
Oklahoma, the digital photography provides a color proxy.
2.2 3D Cardboard Puzzles
In addition to the 3D models, two 3D cardboard puzzles were
created (for TPWD 41WD60 1976.31.11 and TPWD 41WD60
1976.31.16) [7]. These cardboard puzzles were generated
using Autodesk 123D Make 1.6.0 [8], and the plans for the
cardboard puzzles accompanied the uploads to Zenodo. Those
plans can be downloaded, cut, glued to cardboard, then cut
out to create a tangible model of a Caddo vessel (Figure 6).
These files were uploaded to Zenodo in .pdf format, and are
compatible with most laser cutters where they can be cut out
using variety of mediums in addition to cardboard.

4. Reuse Potential
Those data from this project have long-term and wide-ranging
reuse potential, of which many applications may not yet have
been contemplated. While the primary purpose of this endeavor was to document the vessels in advance of a 3D geometric morphometrics study [28, 29, 30], two of these have
since been modeled as 3D puzzles that can be cut out using
materials that are easily acquired by most (i.e., a cardboard
box).
These data have significant reuse potential in the digital
humanities where they can augment more qualitative studies
of decorative designs and motifs. They also hold promise for
clarifying questions of vessel shape and form that can be addressed in analyses of rotational symmetry and 3D geometric
morphometrics.
