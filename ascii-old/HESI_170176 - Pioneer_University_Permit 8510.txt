MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 1 August 2018, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of a segment of Plains All American Pipeline, LP’s (Plains)
proposed Pioneer University 7-14H Connection pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located in
northwestern Martin County, Texas (Project Area). The development of the pipeline ROW will
be privately funded and will not require any federal permitting or coordination. However, a 1.0mile (1.6-kilometer [km])-long segment of the proposed ROW is located on property owned by
the University of Texas (UT). As UT is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the
portion of the undertaking on UT land falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the
cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of Plains in compliance with the ACT.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the
Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit number 8510.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 2.0 miles (3.2 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1
meters [m]) wide, with a total area of approximately 7.3 acres. However, the Project Area (i.e.,
the segment of the proposed ROW that crosses UT land) measures only 1.0 miles (1.6 km) long
by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 3.6 acres.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 17
excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Pioneer University 7-14H Connection Project across UT Land will have no adverse
effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as
SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Plains be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT.
All records produced during the investigations have been curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and
Conditions and the Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of a segment
of Plains All American Pipeline, LP’s (Plains) proposed Pioneer University 7-14H Connection
pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located in northwestern Martin County, Texas (Project Area)
(Figures 1-1 through 1-3). The development of the pipeline ROW will be privately funded and
will not require any federal permitting or coordination. However, a 1.0-mile (1.6-kilometer [km])long segment of the proposed ROW is located on property owned by the University of Texas
(UT). As UT is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the portion of the
undertaking on UT land falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At
the request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of Plains in
compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological
sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the
potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs).
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 2.0 miles (3.2 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1
meters [m]) wide, with a total area of approximately 7.3 acres. However, the Project Area (i.e.,
the segment of the proposed ROW that crosses UT land) measures only 1.0 miles (1.6 km) long
by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 3.6 acres.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s principal investigator,
while Jacob Lyons and Jared Wiersema (Horizon field technicians) conducted the field
investigations. The cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit number 8510.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 1 August 2018. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing along the length of the Project Area.

16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the
Project Area totals 1.0 miles (1.6 km) in length, a minimum of 16 shovel tests were necessary
within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS
by excavating a total of 17 shovel tests across the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 17
excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Pioneer University 7-14H Connection Project across UT land will have no adverse
effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as
SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Plains be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that
any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed pipeline ROW,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC and UT should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

Plains’ proposed Pioneer University 7-14H Connection Project is located in northwestern
Martin County, approximately 11.5 miles (18.5 km) southwest of Patricia, Texas. It can be
found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Scharbauer Ranch, Texas, topographic
quadrangle map (see Figure 1-2). Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 2.0 miles (3.2
km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 7.3 acres. However, the
Project Area (i.e., the segment of the proposed ROW that crosses UT Land) measures only 1.0
miles (1.6 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 3.6 acres.
Representative images of the Project Area at the time of the cultural resources survey are
presented in Figures 2-1 and 2-2.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in northwestern Martin County in far West Texas. It is
situated within an area of gently undulating desert hills just south of Mustang Draw (see Figure
1-2). The proposed ROW initiates at an existing compressor facility at its western end and
extends northeasterly to another existing facility at its eastern end. Roughly the western half of
the proposed ROW is situated on UT land (see Figure 1-2 and 1-3). Elevations within the
Project Area range between 2900.0 and 2910.0 feet (883.9 and 887.0 m) above mean sea level.
Hydrologically, the proposed ROW is situated within the Upper Colorado River basin. It is
drained to the north via overland sheet flow in Mustang Draw. Mustang Draw flows westerly,
joining Beals Creek near Big Spring. Beals Creek flows southeasterly, eventually joining the
Colorado River almost 80.0 miles (128.8 km) southeast of the Project Area.

2.3

CLIMATE

Martin County has a cool-temperate, dry steppe climate. Winters are mild, with an
average temperature of 46.2 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an
average temperature exceeding 90.0°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 14.0
inches (35.6 centimeters [cm]), with most of it falling between May and October (NRCS 1974).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is situated within Blair’s Kansan biotic province that takes in the
Panhandle and the red plains to the east of the escarpment of the high plains. The plants and
animals are mostly grassland species, but some Austroriparian species extend along wooded
stream valleys into the eastern part of the province (Blair 1950). The proposed ROW is located
along the southern edge of the Llano Estacado ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). The Llano
Estacado ecoregion was historically a shortgrass prairie supporting large herds of buffalo.
Common plants species on these prairies included buffalograss, blue and sideoats grama, silver
bluestem, mesquite, yucca, prickly pear, and juniper (Griffith et al. 2007). In addition to
supporting vast bison herds, this ecosystem also included prairie dogs, black-footed ferrets,
burrowing owls, coyotes, pronghorn antelope, gray wolves, and a variety of deer. Playa basins
scattered across this region also attracted migratory waterfowl such as the sandhill crane
(Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: the Paleoindian (pre-8500
B.P.), the Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and the Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic
period is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), the Middle Archaic (6000
BP to 3500 B.P.), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 B.P.)

The Paleoindian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early Paleoindian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 B.P.)

Like the Paleoindian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies
in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.

HJN 170176 AR 02

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries, as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC (1250 TO 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of ceramics and the bow
and arrow in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and other
small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic, sites
continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the majority of
Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked population
increase is highly evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas)
online database indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area (THC 2018). Similarly, a
review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) Nation Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google
Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the
review perimeter (NPS 2018). No documented cultural resources, including any listed on the
NRHP or formally designated as SALs, are located within or immediately adjacent to the
boundaries of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources
surveys have been undertaken within the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric campsite.
This site, 41MT11, is located approximately 2.6 miles (4.2 km) northwest of the Project Area.

4.2

MAP REVIEW

A review of aerial imagery indicates that the area has been used primarily for oil and gas
extraction the in latter quarter of the 20th century. However, aerial imagery dating to 1965 and
1970 indicated that the Project Area traverses a large rectangular area (Figure 4-1). Based on
its size, it is presumed to have been a fenced area or large cattle corral. No fence or structure
is mapped at this location on the 1968 topographic quadrangle map, and the feature does not
appear to have been formally used or maintained in any available aerial imagery after 1970.

4.3

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are
often found in proximity to playa lake beds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the
Project Area on terraces adjacent to Mustang Draw, it was Horizon’s opinion, prior to the field
efforts, that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible standing structures in immediate
proximity to the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map and Google Earth
imagery suggested a decreased potential for historic-era standing structures within the
boundaries of the Project Area. However, the presence of the rectangular enclosure on the late
20th century aerial imagery suggested a moderate to high potential for possible historic-era
cultural deposits associated with cattle ranching in the area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the Project Area on 1 August 2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and
subsurface shovel testing along the length of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a
minimum 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide.
As the Project Area totals 1.0 mile (1.6 km) in length, a minimum of 16 shovel tests were
necessary within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 17 shovel tests across the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site forms were
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated
site forms were completed and filed at the TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD
83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 5-1. Shovel test data are presented in
Appendix A.
All records produced during the investigations have been curated at TARL in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and the Texas Administrative Code Title
13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

On 1 August 2018, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of a
segment of Plains’ proposed Pioneer University 7-14H Connection Project located in
northwestern Martin County, Texas. The development of the pipeline ROW will be privately
funded and will not require any federal permitting or coordination. However, a 1.0-mile (1.6km)-long segment of the proposed ROW is located on property owned by UT. As UT is
considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the portion of the undertaking on UT land
falls under the regulations of the ACT. At the request of Whitenton, Horizon conducted the
cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of Plains in compliance with the ACT.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the
Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as SALs. The cultural
resources survey was conducted under TAC permit number 8510.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 2.0 miles (3.2 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m)
wide, with a total area of approximately 7.3 acres. However, the Project Area (i.e., the segment
of the proposed ROW that crosses UT land) measures only 1.0 miles (1.6 km) long by 30.0 feet
(9.1 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 3.6 acres.
The cultural resources survey consisted of intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing along the length of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the Project Area
totals 1.0 miles (1.6 km) in length, a minimum of 16 shovel tests were necessary within the
Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 17 shovel tests across the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 17
excavated shovel tests. As for the possible corral feature noted on the 1970 aerial imagery of
the location (see Figure 4-1), no evidence of a formal corral or other ranching feature was noted
within the Project Area. Given its overall size on the imagery as well as the fact that modern
pipeline and roadway ROWs extend along its borders, it is assumed that the rectangular area
was likely just a large fenced area/property boundary rather than a formal ranching feature.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Pioneer University 7-14H Connection Project across UT land will have no adverse
effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as
SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Plains be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that
any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed pipeline ROW,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC and UT should be notified of the discovery.
