During December 7–13, 2009 Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of the Texas Department
of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Corpus Christi District, conducted an intensive archeological survey of
approximately 24,816 feet of State Highway (SH) 286 from SH 358 to one mile south of Farm-to-Market
(FM) 43 in the City of Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas (CSJs: 0326-01-051 and 0326-01-052). The
survey was conducted prior to the proposed widening of SH 286. The survey was the second phase of
archeological investigations conducted by B&A for the proposed project. The initial phase of B&A’s
investigations occurred in November 2008 and consisted of archival research concerning an unmarked,
unidentified late nineteenth century to early twentieth century adult female burial (41NU254) discovered
in 1988 within the SH 286 right-of-way (ROW) south of Oso Creek. The burial was discovered in 1988
during a non-TxDOT utilities construction project. The first phase of work also included an archeological
background review to assess the potential for prehistoric archeological sites within the project area.
Because of ambiguities in the 1988 documentation of site 41NU254 concerning the exact location of the
burial, inconclusive results from the 2008 archival research, and the results of the 2008 archeological
background review, B&A conducted an intensive archeological survey with track-hoe scraping to
determine if any other historic graves were in the SH 286 ROW south of Oso Creek. Because of a high
density of buried utilities in southeast quadrant of the creek crossing, subsurface investigations were
limited in that area. In addition to track-hoe scraping, B&A conducted backhoe trenching to determine the
presence/absence of previously unknown deeply buried archeological deposits. The second phase of
investigations discovered no traces of additional historic burials or previously unknown prehistoric
resources within the project area but did discover three mid- to late-twentieth century historical
archeological sites (41NU334, 41NU335, and 41NU336).
Given a lack of intact structures and intact buried components, as well as no apparent association with
events or individuals of historical significance, it is the opinion of B&A that sites 41NU334, 41NU335,
and 41NU336 are not eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (as per
eligibility criteria set forth in National Park Service regulations 36 CFR 60.4) or for formal designation as
a State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) (as per criteria established in Chapter 26.8 of the Antiquities
Code of Texas).
Based on the above data, B&A recommends that the proposed project should be allowed to proceed as
planned without additional investigations, except in the southeast quadrant of the SH 286 crossing at Oso
Creek in an area extending from the creek to 300 feet south of the creek. Although track-hoe scraping in
the southeast quadrant discovered no evidence of additional historical graves, the high density of buried
utilities limited subsurface testing. Because of these conditions, in conjunction with the fact that
41NU254 was discovered within a utility trench in the southeast quadrant of the creek crossing, B&A also
recommends that all subsurface utility relocations or reconstructions in the southeast quadrant from Oso
Creek to 300 feet south of the creek should be monitored to ensure no additional historical graves are
present. No artifacts were collected and curation was unnecessary.

PROJECT TITLE: Intensive Archeological Survey of SH 286 from SH 358 to One Mile South of
FM 43 in the City of Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: During December 7–13, 2009 Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the
request of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Corpus Christi District, conducted an
intensive archeological survey of approximately 24,816 feet of State Highway (SH) 286 from SH 358 to
one mile south of Farm-to-Market (FM) 43 in the City of Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas (CSJs:
0326-01-051 and 0326-01-052). The survey was conducted prior to the proposed widening of SH 286.
The survey was the second phase of archeological investigations conducted by B&A for the proposed
project. The initial phase of B&A’s investigations occurred in November 2008 and consisted of archival
research concerning an unmarked, unidentified late nineteenth century to early twentieth century adult
female burial (41NU254) discovered in 1988 within the SH 286 right-of-way (ROW) south of Oso Creek.
The burial was discovered in 1988 during a non-TxDOT utilities construction project. The first phase of
work also included an archeological background review to assess the potential for prehistoric
archeological sites within the project area.
Because of ambiguities in the 1988 documentation of site 41NU254 concerning the exact location of the
burial, inconclusive results from the 2008 archival research, and the results of the 2008 archeological
background review, B&A conducted an intensive archeological survey with track-hoe scraping to
determine if any other historic graves were in the SH 286 ROW south of Oso Creek. Because of a high
density of buried utilities in southeast quadrant of the creek crossing, subsurface investigations were
limited in that area. In addition to track-hoe scraping, B&A conducted backhoe trenching to determine the
presence/absence of previously unknown deeply buried archeological deposits. The second phase of
investigations discovered no traces of additional historic burials or previously unknown prehistoric
resources within the project area but did discover three mid- to late-twentieth century historical
archeological sites (41NU334, 41NU335, and 41NU336).
Site 41NU334 encompasses the remnants of a mid- to late-twentieth century propane service company
that closed approximately 30 years ago. Given a lack of integrity from previous surface and subsurface
disturbances and the removal/demolition of the buildings and infrastructure related to the former propane
company, B&A recommends that site 41NU334 is not eligible for inclusion to the National register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or for formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation and, as such, the
proposed construction there should be allowed to proceed as planned without further investigations
because the proposed construction should not affect any SALs or archeological historic properties
pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1).
Site 41NU335 consists of a former 1950s house site. Given that the 1950s-era house was demolished and
removed more than 30 years ago, lack of evidence for an associated intact subsurface component, and the
poor structural integrity of associated sub-features that do not exhibit any unusual construction
techniques, B&A recommends that site 41NU335 is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for formal
SAL designation and, as such, the proposed construction there should be allowed to proceed as planned

there without further investigations because the proposed construction should not affect any SALs or
archeological historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1).
Site 41NU336 consists of a hydraulic automotive lift and associated concrete pad. Given a lack of
integrity from previous surface and subsurface disturbances and the removal/demolition of the buildings
and infrastructure of the former gas station and automotive garage, B&A recommends that site 41NU336
is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation and, as such, the proposed
construction should not affect any SALs or archeological historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR
800.4(d)(1).
Based on the above data, B&A recommends that the proposed project should be allowed to proceed as
planned without additional investigations except in the southeast quadrant of the SH 286 crossing at Oso
Creek from the southern end of the SH 286 bridge to 300 feet south of the bridge. Although track-hoe
scraping in the southeast quadrant discovered no evidence of additional historical graves, the high density
of buried utilities at this location limited subsurface testing. Blanton & Associates, Inc. also recommends
that all subsurface utility relocations or reconstructions required for the planned expansion of SH 286 in
the southeast quadrant of the creek crossing, from the southern end of the SH 286 bridge to 300 feet south
of the bridge, should be monitored by archeologists to ensure no additional historical graves are present in
areas where track-hoe scraping was not viable.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is on the south side of the City of Corpus Christi, Nueces
County, Texas. The study area is mapped on the Oso Creek NW, TX (2797-423) USGS 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 256.4 acres.
DATE OF WORK: December 7–13, 2009.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. was assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 5166
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: 41NU334, 41NU335, and 41NU336
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: 41NU254
COMMENTS: Based on poor integrity, a lack of unusual building or construction techniques, no
associated buried artifacts, and no apparent association with an event or individual of historical
significance, B&A recommends that sites 41NU334, 41NU335, and 41NU336 are not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP (36 CFR 60.4) or for formal designation as a SAL (as per criteria established in
Chapter 26.8 of the Antiquities Code of Texas) and the proposed construction there should be allowed to
proceed as planned without additional investigations.

During December 7–13, 2009 Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of the Texas Department
of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Corpus Christi District, conducted an intensive archeological survey of
approximately 24,816 feet of State Highway (SH) 286 from SH 358 to one mile south of Farm-to-Market
(FM) 43 in the City of Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas (CSJs: 0326-01-051 and 0326-01-052)
(Figures 1 and 2). The survey was conducted prior to the proposed widening of SH 286. The survey was
the second phase of archeological investigations conducted by B&A for the proposed project. All work
was conducted under TxDOT Contract No. 57-7XXSD001.
The initial phase of B&A’s investigations occurred in November 2008 and consisted of archival research
concerning an unmarked, unidentified late nineteenth century to early twentieth century adult female
burial (41NU254) discovered in 1988 within the SH 286 right-of-way (ROW) south of Oso Creek. The
burial was discovered in 1988 during a non-TxDOT utilities construction project. The first phase of work
also included an archeological background review to assess the potential for prehistoric archeological
sites within the project area.
Because of ambiguities in the 1988 documentation of site 41NU254 concerning the exact location of the
burial, inconclusive results from the 2008 archival research, and the results of the 2008 archeological
background review, B&A conducted an intensive archeological survey with track-hoe scraping to
determine if any other historic graves were in the SH 286 ROW south of Oso Creek. Because of a high
density of buried utilities in southeast quadrant of the creek crossing, subsurface investigations were
limited in that area. In addition to track-hoe scraping, B&A conducted backhoe trenching to determine the
presence/absence of previously unknown deeply buried archeological deposits.

The planned expansion of SH 286 would occur within existing ROW and involve widening SH 286 from
a two-lane roadway to a six-lane highway with two 2-lane frontage roads from SH 358 to one mile south
of FM 43 (CSJs: 0326-01-051 and 0326-01-052). The existing SH 286 ROW from SH 358 to 1,000 feet
north of Oso Creek and from 1,000 feet south of Oso Creek to the southern project terminus is 400 feet
wide. However, from 1,000 feet north of Oso Creek to 1,000 feet south of the creek, the existing ROW
expands to 450 feet wide (Figure 3). The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) is therefore
approximately 24,816 feet long, a maximum of 450 feet wide, and approximately 256.4 acres in size.
Vertical impacts would extend an estimated maximum depth of 30 feet for overpass columns and an
estimated maximum depth of four feet for roadway construction. The vertical depths of construction
impacts represent an estimated worse case scenario and are based on existing design plans.
Because the proposed construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and
administered by TxDOT, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now
subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation requires that any political
subdivision of the State of Texas must identify potential State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) through
survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs. Furthermore, as the
project would utilize funds from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the project is also subject

to the provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Investigations were conducted
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (FA-PA)
among the FHWA, TxDOT, the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer (TXSHPO), the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and TxDOT Regarding the Implementation of Transportation
Undertakings (PA-TU), Stipulation VII, 43 TAC 2.24 (j) (3), and the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources discovered within the
project area, evaluate their eligibility for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
for formal SAL designation and, if significant resources were discovered, make recommendations for
future archeological management options such as avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

The project location consists of nearly level to slightly depressed coastal prairie underlain by the ancient
Pleistocene Beaumont Formation. The Beaumont Formation consists mostly of stream channel, point bar,
levee, and backswamp deposits of clay, silt, sand, and gravel (Barnes 1975). In some parts of the APE, the
formation is mostly clay and mud with low permeability, a high water-holding capacity, and includes
interdistributary muds, abandoned channel-fill muds, and overbank muds. As the Beaumont Formation
predates known human occupation of the region, these deposits have a low potential for containing buried
intact archeological resources. In contrast, Oso Creek contains recent (Holocene) alluvium consisting of
clay, sand, silt, and gravel deposits found in point bars, levees, and terrace deposits along the Nueces
River and other drainages in the area (Barnes 1975). Regionally, Holocene alluvium has consistently been
shown to have a good potential for containing intact buried archeological deposits.
SOI L S
There are four soils in the APE: Victoria clay (0 to 1 percent slopes), Victoria clay (1 to 3 percent slopes),
Gullied land, saline, and Tidal flats (Francki et al. 1992). The vast majority (ca. 95 percent or greater) of
the APE consists of Victoria clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes. This soil is described as “blackland” and
developed in situ from calcareous clays under a cover of prairie grasses. The soil’s surface layer is heavy
dark gray clay that can extend to a depth of 36 inches below ground surface and overlies dense gray to
pale brown clay subsoil to a depth of 65 inches or more below ground surface. This soil has little potential
to contain intact buried archeological deposits. Included in the APE is a small area of Victoria clay, 1 to 3
percent slopes, on a gentle slope on the north side of Oso Creek. Victoria clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes is as
described above (Francki et al. 1992:17–18).
Immediately adjacent to the north and south banks of Oso Creek is Gullied land, saline, which consists of
steep, heavily eroded and gullied areas along streams that are comprised of numerous mixed soils.
Surface soil remains as isolated ‘islands” amongst gullies where frequently exposed subsoil can be
observed. Surface soil is dark gray clay overlying gray salty and crumbly clay (Francki et al. 1992:12).
The channel of Oso Creek consists of Tidal flats composed of sand, shell, and clay that are flooded during
high tide but exposed at low tide (Francki et al. 1992:16–17).
F L OR A
The vegetation of the study area is relatively diverse Tamaulipan thornshrub on the drier uplands and
slopes that merge into riparian woodlands in the ravine. Dominant canopy species include Texas
sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), anaqua (Ehretia anacua), and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Other
species observed in this habitat patch include lotebush (Zizyphus obtusifolia), Texas torchwood (Amyris
texana), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), winged elm (U. alata), colima (Zanthoxylum fagara), southwest
myrtle croton (Bernardia myricifolia), allthorn (Koeberlinia spinosa), and retama (Parkinsonia aculata).
Common herbaceous species in the project area include guineagrass (Urochloa maxima), buffelgrass
(Pennisetum ciliare), common bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), common lantana (Lantana camara),
three-awn grass (Aristida sp.), King Ranch bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum), and Texas gramagrass
(Bouteloua rigidiseta).

Nueces County is in the Coastal Prairies Region of Texas and is generally flat. Early non-Indian
settlement was under Spanish rule; however, by the 1820s, skirmishes with the native groups forced
Spanish settlers to relocate to the Rio Grande Valley (Long 2008b). Until the mid-nineteenth century,
Nueces County was disputed territory between the Republic and Mexico.
By about 1850, the year the first Federal Census was taken for the county, there were approximately 689
residents within Nueces County. While the population was small, there were settlements developing
within the county including Oso, a short-lived community, and Corpus Christi, both within the project
area. Yellow Fever outbreaks during the nineteenth century kept the population down and settlers away.
Economically, the region relied on ranching, and farming remained largely subsistence (Long 2008b).
Oso, believed to be located along the northern bank of Oso Creek near the project area had 29 residents in
1850, a school, and some farms. Although no information could verify this, it appears something
happened within the county on the eve of the Civil War, as the community of Oso ceased to exist. No
records in the 1860 Federal Census were found, and it appears the residents began selling off their land
during this period, although the community name continues to appear until 1870. No other information
about Oso could be found.
During the Civil War, Corpus Christi served as a shipping point for cotton to England. Although union
blockades were able to stop ships, overland routes remained open throughout the war. After the war,
Nueces County residents experienced a period of lawlessness related to cattle rustling and economic
hardship because there were no nearby markets to obtain and trade goods. This changed by the end of the
century and beginning of the twentieth century.
As a regional hub, Corpus Christi sought ways to improve shipping. During the last quarter of the
nineteenth century, attempts were made to deepen the main sea channel (Long 2008a). This, along with
the arrival of the railroad to town, guaranteed Corpus Christi’s position as a local hub. By 1885, it had a
population of 4,200, three banks, a customhouse, railroad-related businesses, factories, and several
churches (Long 2008a).
This growth continued, but the greatest developments occurred between 1906 and 1914 when the local
banks grew ten-fold. The city of Corpus became a prime tourist destination and, with money coming from
this economic venture, the city was able to improve infrastructure with paved roads, sewer lines, and
install a modern water treatment plant (Long 2008a). Oil and gas was discovered in the county during the
1920s, and within a few years, several oil and gas production facilities were established countywide.
During this period, cash crop farming developed and cotton production dominated the county.
By the 1930s, Nueces County was among the leading counties for cotton production. Although cotton was
the primary crop, farmers grew vegetables and relied on mechanized farming and by World War II,
Nueces County farmers were some of the most mechanized farmers in the state. Many owned tractors,
cotton pickers, and other machinery that greatly facilitated agricultural production in the county. Their
farms reflected the change in technology and had machine sheds, and other outbuildings used to store
cotton pickers and harvesters, thereby replacing smaller, animal units. The years between the Great

Depression and World War II were difficult for county residents. Deflated cotton prices, boll weevil
destruction, and loss of rural jobs forced many county residents into the cities to look for work. Between
the 1930s and 1950s, the number of farms within the county fell by 600.
Although the county underwent difficulties, the period between the 1930s and 40s was when rural roads
and highways underwent significant transportation improvements. The portion of SH 286 currently under
consideration, along with other major roads and highways, were paved, giving farms better access to
markets. It was during this period that rural farms in the county either upgraded their main houses or built
entirely new ones. Using popular styles of the period, influenced by improved methods of transportation
and communication, many in the rural sector quickly adopted Craftsman-style houses for their ease of
construction and smaller, more utilitarian floor plans, which were believed to aid in a healthier
environment compared to the more cluttered plans of the Victorian era. Typical rural Craftsman-style
houses in South Texas generally utilized a front-gable plan, although side and cross-gables were readily
available. Often, homes were frame construction, possibly from East Texas lumber mills and based on the
relatively simple use of materials, it appears many may were brought in on the rails and hauled to their
site. The Craftsman-style house seems to have remained a popular choice in the region until the eve of
World War II.
Long recognized as a strategic military position, Nueces County has been home to a variety of forts and
other military bases. During World War II, a Naval Air Station was established. Associated with it was
Cabaniss Airfield, located near the project area. Originally constructed in 1941, it served as one of three
satellite hubs for Corpus Christi Naval Air Station. During World War II, it had 10 outlying landing
fields, and was still active eight years later. Like other military defense bases constructed nationwide, the
buildings were standardized 700 and 800 series. Most of the buildings constructed at these facilities were
frame and tended to be temporary, lasting only five to seven years (Michael Baker Jr, Inc. 2008: 20). By
1951, Cabaniss had four paved runways, three hangars, a control tower, and numerous buildings.
Sometime between 1951 and 1964 it closed, but reopened later as a satellite airfield for Navy use. By
1975, the majority of buildings were gone. Thirty years later, four runways were still there and at least
two hangars are still extant. It appears the majority of land where other military buildings once stood is
occupied by the Corpus Christi Independent School District (Freeman 2008).
By the 1960s, Corpus Christi had recovered from the effects of the Depression and was moving forward
economically. The population doubled between 1941 and 1952 to over 100,000 (Corpus). With such a
large population influx and a strong military presence, adequate housing needed to be constructed. After
World War II, many returning GIs sought to purchase their own house and yard utilizing federal
assistance through the GI bill. The result was the construction of millions of pre-fabricated houses
nationwide that utilized simplified Colonial or other Revival style details with a small floor plan of
approximately 850 square feet. These homes were often located in subdivisions with other similar houses.
The result was entire neighborhoods consisting of various Ranch-style houses or Minimal Traditional
houses nationwide that lacked unique, individual architectural details and characteristics. The increased
population also allowed for the growth of the Corpus Christi Ship Channel when a series of deeper
channels was also cut, making Corpus Christi harbor one of the busiest in the state.

watching, fishing, and camping. Corpus Christi continues to grow and develop, and attracts tourists to the
region while providing diverse activities based on its unique cultural heritage and blending.

An initial review of records available at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and
records available on the Texas Historical Commission’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA)
indicates that there are a number of previously recorded archeological sites and previous project areas
within a 1,000-meter search radius of the existing 400-foot wide SH 286 ROW.
The earliest documented archeological investigations within the 1,000-meter search radius were
undertaken in 1972 by local avocational archeologists. Approximately 1,200 meters northwest of the SH
286/SH 357 intersection and 45 meters south of Frio Street near Los Encinos School is 41NU159, the
remains of a prehistoric open camp with a surface scatter of chert debitage, burned clay balls/lumps, and
marine shell (TASA). On the north bank of Oso Creek roughly 900 meters northwest of the north end of
the SH 286 bridge at Oso Creek is site 41NU214. The site occupies the edge of a clay dune and, at the
time of its documentation, exhibited a thin surface scatter of chert debitage and burned clay balls/lumps
(TASA).
During archeological survey investigations along Oso Creek in 1973, archeologists discovered prehistoric
and historic site 41NU97 approximately 800 meters west of the southern end of the SH 286 bridge at Oso
Creek. The site, as described in 1973, consisted of a surface scatter of chert debitage, snail and oyster
shell, historic debris, and human skeletal remains. Unfortunately, the historic artifacts were not described
and it was undetermined if the human remains were prehistoric or historic (TASA). The presence of
human remains on this site within a relatively close proximity to 41NU254 suggests the upper terrace
south of Oso Creek (and possibly north) was a popular locale for burials, be they prehistoric, as based on
previous investigations along Oso Creek or historic.
Approximately 1,100 meters southwest of the SH 286/SH 357 interchange, the United States Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE) Galveston District conducted an archeological survey in 1985 for a proposed
borrow pit within the City of Corpus Christi Greenwood Road City Sanitary Landfill. Investigations
resulted in the discovery of prehistoric camp site 41NU230, a widely distributed and thin surface scatter
of chipped-stone tool fragments, chert debitage, baked clay lumps, and shell and bone fragments. The site
was heavily disturbed by previous agricultural plowing and landfill activities and no cultural features
were identified. The site was not recommended as NRHP eligible and no additional work was
recommended (TASA).
Following the 1985 USACE survey above, the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
(SDHPT) conducted a survey in 1986 for the proposed expansion of SH 286 from SH 358 to just south of
FM 43. The planned corridor was parallel to and roughly 1,000 feet west of the existing SH 286. No
previously unrecorded sites were discovered during investigations, though the western edge of the
proposed extension corridor traversed 41NU230. No trace of the site was discovered and no additional
work was recommended (SDHPT 1986).
In 1988, an historic human burial (site 41NU254) was unexpectedly exposed during the excavation of a
pipeline trench (Smith 1988). The burial was located within the eastern margins of the SH 286 ROW
approximately 100 meters southeast of the southern end of the bridge spanning Oso Creek. Subsequent

archival research in 1988, which included examinations of records in the Nueces County Attorney’s
Office and a plat survey with the Nueces County Surveyor, discovered no records indicating a formally
dedicated private or public cemetery had been established in the area (Smith 1988). Despite the apparent
lack of any records concerning a cemetery in that location, a local informant interviewed by Mr. Smith
recalled seeing in 1928 a number of wood crosses in the vicinity of the burial just east of SH 286. The
informant stated that by the 1940s all of the crosses were gone, having deteriorated with age. Reinterment of the burial occurred at Rose Hill Memorial Park in Corpus Christi on 4 August 1988 (Smith
1988).
In the northeast quadrant of the SH 286 crossing of Oso Creek is Cabaniss Naval Auxiliary Landing
Field. In 1993 the USACE, on behalf of the United States Air force, completed an 852-acre archeological
survey of the field that resulted in the recording of five prehistoric sites, 41NU270 through 41NU274
(Gunn and Lilly 1994). Of those sites, 41NU272 is located approximately 700 meters northeast of where
SH 286 crosses Oso Creek. This site was described as a 15-meter by 15-meter lithic scatter. Previous
horizontal and vertical disturbances had impacted the site, but a phase of backhoe trenching was
recommended to prospect for deeply buried intact deposits. The remaining prehistoric camp sites recorded
on the air base are more than 1,000 meters from the current study area (Gunn and Lilly 1994).
In 2001 an archeological survey was conducted on behalf of the City of Corpus Christi. That project
consisted of a survey of 9.1 miles of a proposed 14-mile long water transmission line (Southside Water
Transmission Main). The water line easement crossed SH 286 from northwest to southeast approximately
200 meters south of Oso Creek. Investigations discovered no archeological resources (Turpin 2001).
In 2008 B&A conducted a thorough archive review in local and state repositories in Corpus Christi and
Austin in response to an unmarked, unidentified adult female burial (41NU254) dating from the late
nineteenth to early twentieth century that was discovered within the SH 286 ROW during a 1988 nonTxDOT utilities construction project (Smith 1988). The review of archival data was inconclusive. None of
the consulted resources referred to a formally dedicated public or family cemetery in or adjacent to the
study area. Based on the results of the background review, B&A recommended the below:
1) The existing SH 286 ROW from SH 358 to 1,000 feet north of Oso Creek and from 1,000 feet
south of Oso Creek to the southern project terminus should be subjected to an intensive
pedestrian archeological survey with judgmental shovel testing,
2) An area extending from the south bank of Oso Creek to 300 feet south of the creek on the east
side of the roadway and within a 100-foot wide swath inside the existing ROW west of the
roadway from the south bank of Oso Creek to 300 feet south of the creek should be scraped
(while monitored by professional archeologists) with a track-hoe to determine if there are other
historic graves within or adjacent to the existing SH 286 ROW. If scraping does not identify other
grave shafts, then a systematic ground penetrating radar or a magnetometer survey could
potentially locate subsurface anomalies and disturbances that represent additional graves), and

feet south of the creek to prospect for intact buried prehistoric material following scraping and/or
remote sensing investigations.

Blanton & Associates, Inc. conducted an intensive archeological survey of the APE with surface and
subsurface investigations to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of Texas
Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council of
Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian inspection
of the ground surface within the proposed impact area. Where possible, cutbank profiles along Oso Creek
were inspected for the presence of buried archeological deposits. Subsurface investigations included
track-hoe scraping, backhoe trenching, and judgmental shovel testing as appropriate based on field
conditions. All investigations were thoroughly photo-documented with digital cameras.
Given previous surface and subsurface impacts from utilities, agricultural activities, and roadway
construction, as well as the presence of upland clays that developed in situ in the APE from SH 358 to
1,000 feet north of Oso Creek and from 1,000 feet south of Oso Creek to the southern project terminus,
subsurface investigations in this part of the APE consisted of judgmental shovel testing. All shovel tests
were 30 to 40 in size and excavated with a spade in arbitrary 20-centimeter levels until 100 centimeters
below ground surface was reached or until soil characteristics or bedrock prohibited deeper excavation.
All removed soil was screened through 0.25-inch wire mesh to ensure artifact recovery and all shovel-test
locations were plotted with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver. Additional shovel
testing was conducted on all archeological sites discovered during the survey to determine the
presence/absence of a buried site component and to delineate site boundaries. Because of the previous
removal of the burial (41NU254) from the APE at Oso Creek, as well the presence of Holocene alluvium
along Oso Creek that could contain buried archeological material, the APE from 1,000 feet north of Oso
Creek to 1,000 feet south of Oso Creek and site 41NU254 was subjected to mechanical subsurface
investigations.
Track-hoe scraping was conducted from the south bank of Oso Creek to 300 feet south of the creek on the
east side of the roadway and within a 100-foot wide swath inside the existing ROW west of the roadway
from the south bank of Oso Creek to 300 feet south of the creek was scraped (while monitored by
professional archeologists) with a track-hoe. Scrape areas were initially prepared by removing all
vegetation. Scraping was accomplished in arbitrary 10-centimeter levels to maintain a level clean floor
across the scrape areas. Scraping proceeded to various depths depending upon soil characteristics (e.g.,
multiple banded flood deposits overlying clay subsoil near the creek or homogenous dense upland clays).
The location of scrape areas was primarily influenced by the reported location of 41NU254, as well as
existing buried utilities, the roadway and bridge fill sections, saturated ground conditions, the presence of
fill for erosion and flood control.
In scrape areas near Oso Creek, it was necessary for scraping to extend deeper than in the adjacent
uplands to examine the older homogenously colored and textured clay subsoil beneath the multiple
banded flood deposits. Scraping extended until the archeologists were confident that intact homogenous
subsoil was encountered (e.g., there were no soil color and textural changes indicative of disturbance such
as a grave shaft or pit outline). When the archeologists were confident that intact subsoil was encountered,
INTENSIVE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF SH 286 FROM SH 358 TO ONE MILE SOUTH OF FM 43,
NUECES COUNTY, TEXAS

13

the scraping continued in arbitrary 20-centimeter levels to ensure that no unusually deep burials were
present and to eliminate the necessity of remote sensing.
Backhoe trenching was conducted from 1,000 feet north of Oso creek to 1,000 feet south of Oso creek
within the existing SH 286 ROW to prospect for intact buried prehistoric material following scraping.
Backhoe trenches were approximately five meters (16.4 feet) long, one meter (3.3 feet) wide, and 1.5
meters (4.9 feet) deep. Archeologists cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts,
features, and/or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units in each trench were recorded on a
B&A geologic profile form and photographed and all trench locations were plotted with GPS.
Site documentation involved the recording of the horizontal and vertical extent of all archeological sites
discovered within the APE. All recorded sites were evaluated with respect to their eligibility for inclusion
to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (as per eligibility criteria set forth in National Park
Service regulations 36 CFR 60.4.) or for formal designation as a SAL (as per criteria established in
Chapter 26.8 of the Antiquities Code of Texas). Sites were recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data
Form and then submitted electronically to TARL via the TEXSITE recording system. Site data included a
description of the site’s environment, cultural materials noted within the APE and observations on the
continuance of any site that extends outside of the APE and on to private property.

R E SUL T S OF I NV E ST I G A T I ONS
Intensive survey efforts in the APE utilizing track-hoe scraping, backhoe trenching, and judgmental
shovel testing discovered no evidence of additional historic burials associated with previously recorded
site 41NU254 or previously unknown prehistoric resources. Investigations indicated that the surface and
subsurface throughout the APE (Figures 4.1 through 4.13) has experienced disturbances from prior land
use, surface and subsurface utilities, the placement of fill for erosion/flood control, and extensive previous
agricultural plowing. As Figure 4.4 indicates, the SH 286 ROW at Oso Creek includes a high density of
subsurface utilities along the margins of the eastern ROW boundary. Individual utilities within the
corridor include a large fiber optic cable, a water line, and a high-pressure gas pipeline (Figure 5 and
Figure 6). The presence of these utilities eliminated the majority of the eastern edge of the ROW as
viable subsurface testing locations. Although subsurface testing discovered no previously unknown
archeological resources, survey efforts discovered three historic archeological sites (41NU334 through
41NU336). The following discusses first the results of subsurface investigations and concludes with a
description of sites 41NU334 through 41NU336.
SUB SUR F A C E I NV E ST I G A T I ONS
As Appendix A indicates, archeologists excavated a total of 29 shovel tests (STs) throughout the project
area (see Figures 4.1 through 4.13). Because upland clay occupies the majority of the APE from SH 358
to 1,000 feet north of Oso Creek and from 1,000 feet south of Oso Creek to the southern project terminus,
as well as previous impacts to the existing SH 286 ROW from extensive agricultural plowing, existing
subsurface utilities, and roadway construction, shovel testing occurred primarily on sites 41NU334
through 41NU336 (see Site Descriptions below). Except for STs 6, 7, 9, 21, and 22 on the north and south
banks of Oso Creek, which exhibited banded alluvial stratigraphy, shovel testing consistently revealed
dense upland clay that developed in situ with little to no potential to contain intact buried archeological
deposits (see Appendix A).
Track-Hoe Scraping
Efforts to determine the presence or absence of additional historic human burials (associated with site
41NU254) from the south bank of Oso Creek to 300 feet south of the creek on the east side of the existing
ROW and within a 100-foot wide swath inside the existing ROW west of the roadway from the south
bank of Oso Creek to 300 feet south of the creek involved controlled scraping in six Scrape Areas (SAs).
Three SAs (nos. 3, 4, and 6) were completed in the eastern edge of the ROW, while SAs 1, 2, and 5 were
completed west of SH 286 (see Figure 4.4). Where track-hoe scraping was possible within the existing
SH 286 ROW, investigations discovered no evidence of additional historic burials or other buried
archeological material.
Scrape Area 1
Scrape Area 1 was completed in the southwest quadrant of the SH 286 crossing of Oso Creek (see
Figure 4.4) and measured 19 meters north-south by 22 meters east-west. Scraping proceeded and exposed
no evidence of grave shafts or any other historic or prehistoric cultural material. Stratigraphy exposed

(Figure 7). From top to bottom, the zones consisted of silt clay loam (0 to 14 centimeters), loose sand (14
to 37 centimeters), firm sand (37 to 60 centimeters), silt clay (60 to 68 centimeters), sandy clay loam (68
to 106 centimeters), sandy clay (106 to 156 centimeters), silt clay (156 to 171 centimeters), and clay (171
to 180 centimeters) (Appendix B). The clear breaks between stratigraphic zones ensured that any
disturbances from potential grave pits would be readily identifiable. As no such disturbances were
observed, archeologists terminated efforts in SA 1.

Scrape Area 2
Scrape Area 2 was completed in the southwest quadrant of the SH 286 crossing of Oso Creek (see
Figure 4.4) and measured 17 meters north-south by 17 meters east-west. A large berm of clay fill and
construction debris (e.g., concrete rebar and miscellaneous metal) berm occurs about 10 meters north of

this area. The berm continues west beyond the western ROW boundary for an unknown distance. This
berm is 10 meters wide and is elevated five to 10 meters above the adjacent ground surface. Scraping
proceeded to a depth of 130 centimeters below ground surface and exposed no evidence of grave shafts or
any other historic or prehistoric cultural material. Stratigraphy exposed during the scraping consisted of
two zones of dense clay from 0 to 130 centimeters below ground surface. Zone I extended from 0 to 65
centimeters below ground surface and consisted of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist and dense silt clay
with a diffuse and smooth lower boundary overlying Zone II, which was sticky and very dense yellowishbrown (10YR 5/4) silt clay to a depth of 130 centimeters. The clear stratigraphic break between Zones I
and II ensured that any disturbances from potential grave pits would be readily identifiable. As no such
disturbances were observed, archeologists terminated efforts in SA 2.
Scrape Area 3
Scrape Area 2 was completed in the southeast quadrant of the SH 286 crossing of Oso Creek (see
Figure 4.4) and measured 19 meters north-south by 11.5 meters east-west. Scraping proceeded to a depth
of 130 centimeters below ground surface and exposed no evidence of grave shafts or any other historic or
prehistoric cultural material.
Stratigraphy exposed during the scraping consisted of four zones of dense clay from 0 to 150 centimeters
below ground surface (see Appendix B). From 0 to 36 centimeters below ground surface, Zone I
consisted of clay fill containing modern brick fragments, lumber, asphalt, and road base gravel with an
abrupt and smooth lower boundary and no artifacts. Zone II extended from 36 to 92 centimeters and
consisted of a zone of alternating sandy clay loam and clay bands, and contained no artifacts. The moist
and friable sandy clay loams were light gray (10YR 7/2), typically five centimeters thick, and exhibited
abrupt and smooth lower boundaries. The darker very firm clay bands were dark grayish brown (10YR
4/2), typically three centimeters thick, and exhibited abrupt and smooth boundaries. These multiple thin
zones represent repeated flood deposits (sand) and subsequent settling of clay from backwater deposits.
Zone III extended from 92 to 130 centimeters below ground surface and consisted of dark gray (10YR
4/1) sticky and dense silt clay that contained one-centimeter micro-bands of fine sand that may represent
low velocity flooding episodes. The zone has a diffuse and smooth lower boundary. Zone IV extended
from 130 to 150 centimeters and consisted of moist and very firm gray (10YR 5/1) silt clay with abundant
calcium carbonate masses and flecking. The textural and hue breaks between Zones II and III and Zones
III and IV ensured that any disturbances from potential grave pits would be readily identifiable. As no
such disturbances were observed, archeologists terminated efforts in SA 3.
Scrape Area 4
Scrape Area 4 was completed in the southeast quadrant of the SH 286 crossing of Oso Creek (see
Figure 4.4) and measured 10.0 meters north-south by six meters east-west. Scraping proceeded to a depth
of 90 centimeters below ground surface and exposed no evidence of grave shafts or any other historic or
prehistoric cultural material. Stratigraphy exposed during the scraping consisted of two zones of dense
clay from 0 to 90 centimeters below ground surface. Zone I extended from 0 to 45 centimeters below
ground surface and consisted of sticky and firm very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt clay with a clear
and smooth lower boundary. Zone II consisted of very sticky and very dense brownish-yellow (10YR 6/6)

clay containing common calcium carbonate nodules to a depth of 90 centimeters. The clear stratigraphic
break between Zones I and II ensured that any disturbances from potential grave pits would be readily
identifiable. As no such disturbances were observed, archeologists terminated efforts in SA 4.
Scrape Area 5
Scrape Area 5 was completed in the southwest quadrant of the SH 286 crossing of Oso Creek (see
Figure 4.4) and measured eight meters north-south by eight meters east-west (Figure 8). Scraping
proceeded to a depth of 100 centimeters below ground surface and exposed no evidence of grave shafts or
any other historic or prehistoric cultural material. Stratigraphy exposed during the scraping consisted of
two zones of dense clay. Zone I extended from 0 to 65 centimeters below ground surface and consisted of
sticky and firm black (10YR 2/1) clay with a diffuse and smooth lower boundary. Zone II extended from
65 to 100 centimeters below ground surface and consisted of very sticky and very dense grayish-brown
(10YR 5/2) clay containing common calcium carbonate filaments to a depth of 90 centimeters. The clear
stratigraphic break between Zones I and II ensured that any disturbances from potential grave pits would
be readily identifiable. As no such disturbances were observed, archeologists terminated efforts in SA 5.

Scrape Area 6
Scrape Area 6 was completed in the southeast quadrant of the SH 286 crossing of Oso Creek (see
Figure 4.4) and measured 10.0 meters north-south by eight meters east-west. Scraping proceeded to a
depth of 100 centimeters below ground surface and exposed no evidence of grave shafts or any other
historic or prehistoric cultural material. Stratigraphy exposed during the scraping consisted of three zones
of dense clay. Zone I extended from 0 to 53 centimeters below ground surface and consisted of wet very
dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay containing asphalt and road base gravels with a diffuse and smooth lower
boundary. Zone II extended from 53 to 83 centimeters below ground surface and consisted of very sticky
and very dense grayish-brown (10YR 5/2) clay containing common calcium carbonate filaments and
exhibiting a diffuse and smooth lower boundary. The clear stratigraphic break between strata ensured that
any disturbances from potential grave pits would be readily identifiable. As no such disturbances were
observed, archeologists terminated efforts in SA 6.
Backhoe Trenching
Due to the high density of existing buried utilities and the results from track-hoe scraping, backhoe
trenching at Oso Creek was limited to the northwest quadrant of the SH 286 crossing, where two trenches
were excavated (Appendix C and see Figures 4.4 and 4.5). The excavation of Backhoe Trench (BHT) 1
extended to a maximum depth of 170 centimeters and exhibited four strata (I through IV) of dark to very
dark hued upland clay that developed in place from ancient marine sediments (From top to bottom, the
strata transition from a very dark grayish-brown clay plow zone in Zone I before grading to very dark
grayish-brown clay subsoil in Zone II, gray (10YR 7/2) clay in Zone III, and finally to light reddishbrown basal clay mottled with white (2.5Y 8/1) calcium carbonate masses in Zone IV. No artifacts or
evidence of historic graves or prehistoric features were identified and excavations were halted (see
Appendix C).
Backhoe Trench 2 was excavated approximately 50 meters south of BHT 1 (see Figure 4.4). Excavations
extended to a maximum depth of 110 centimeters below ground surface and contained three strata (nos. I
through IV) of dark to very dark hued upland clay that developed in place from ancient marine sediments.

the site is primarily buffelgrass with scattered mesquite and Chinese tallow.
Surface investigations indicated that the site has experienced disturbances from activities at the propane
service company, and the demolition and/or removal of its previously buildings, as evidenced in scraped
areas. Subsurface investigations included the excavation of seven STs (23 through 29) (see Appendix A).

centimeters below ground surface. Other than the modern debris, shovel testing revealed no additional
buried cultural materials (see Appendix C). Although no subsurface component was discovered, the site
of four features (Features 1 through 4).
Feature 1
Feature 1 is a large cylindrical metal tank and two crushed shell aggregate and concrete (“shellcrete”)
bulk tank support piers (Figure 10 and see Figure 9). Individual piers measured approximately four feet
long, three feet high, and one foot thick. Each support has a curved upper surface in which the metal tank
would have been cradled. At the time of recording, the metal tank was empty and had fallen off one of the
supports. This feature covers an area approximately two by three meters in size and is oriented north to
south.

Feature 2
Feature 2 consists of three curved pre-cast concrete support piers for horizontal aboveground bulk
propane storage tanks. The piers are aligned on a north-south axis, with each pier approximately seven
feet tall, ten feet wide, and one foot thick (Figure 11 and see Figure 9).

Feature 3
Feature 3 is one large motor mount consisting of three individual rectangular concrete blocks with two
threaded mounting bolts (Figure 12 and see Figure 9). The individual blocks are equally spaced roughly
six feet apart and occur within a chain-link fenced enclosure. The individual concrete blocks are
approximately four feet long, one foot wide, and about one foot tall. Based on the chain-link fence topped
with several strands of barbed wire, it is presumed that the enclosure contained valuable machinery, such
as large volume pumps.
Feature 4
Feature 4 consists of a large rectangular block made of concrete with crushed oyster shell aggregate
(“shellcrete”) (see Figure 9). The block was likely part of a previous tank support. Feature 4 measures
approximately seven feet long, two feet wide, and two feet thick.
Based on discussions with local resident D. Galloway (2009 personal communication), who owns the
property east and west of SH 286 on the south side of Oso Creek, as well as discussions with TxDOT
personnel from the Corpus Christi District, site 41NU334 encompasses the remnants of a mid- to late

cannot provide any new or important historical information, and no additional investigations are
recommended.

(Figure 13). The site measures 225 feet north-south by 150 feet east-west. Soils on the site are dense
upland clays that developed in situ. Vegetation consists of dense buffelgrass, mesquite, willow,
hackberry, and miscellaneous scrubby and woody plants.
Artifacts observed on the site included asbestos tile fragments, asphalt roof shingle fragments, window
glass shards, clear bottle glass fragments, several glass Coke bottles from the 1960s or 1970s, and
miscellaneous plastic and rusted metal fragments. Subsurface investigations involved the excavation of
six STs (11 and 16 through 20) (see Figure 13). Only ST 11 contained any buried cultural material,
which consisted of one asbestos tile fragment, one fragment of blue plastic and two asphalt shingle
fragments dispersed from 0 to 20 centimeters below ground surface) (see Appendix A). In addition to the
structural debris, the site contains four associated features (Features 1 through 4).

Feature 1

Feature 1 consists of a north-south trending segment of a concrete walkway that may have led into what
had been the houses’ backyard or side yard. The walkway remnant is partially buried under about five
centimeters of loamy, humic zone and measures approximately 33 inches wide and 75 inches long. No
associated artifacts were discovered adjacent to the walkway or buried within the overlying soil.
Feature 2
Feature 2 is a dilapidated corral-like enclosure constructed of milled lumber with galvanized wire nails,
sheet metal, and segments of chain link fence on the north edge of the site. The feature is approximately
20 by 30 feet in size (Figure 14 and see Figure 13). The feature appears haphazardly constructed and a
plastic PVC pipe extends into the center of the feature and may have supplied water to a trough, although
it does not extend below ground.

Figure 14. Feature 2 on 41NU335

Feature 3
Feature 3 is in the northwest part of the site and consists of a circular reinforced concrete water tank
approximately 98 inches in diameter and 30 inches tall (see Figure 13).

Feature 4
Feature 4 encompasses three separate but related segments of a wire mesh/chain link fence. The core of
the feature is a metal fence post with an attached metal gate. Remnants of the fence extend away to the
south and northwest of the gate and post: approximately 30 feet south of the gate is a metal post from the
same fence line, while there is a corner post from the fence about 45 feet further to the southwest (see
Figure 13). Presumably the fence enclosed the yard around the former house.
Discussions with the landowner (Mr. V. Simcik of Corpus Christi) indicated that the former house
belonged to his aunt and uncle (Mr. and Mrs. Amel Elzner) and was built in the 1950s. The Mr. and Mrs.
Elzner lived there for 15 to 20 years until severe flooding forced them to abandon the house, at which
time they moved to Corpus Christi where Mr. Elzner died in the 1970s. Eventually, the house completely
collapsed and was washed away in floods and/or removed. The property was originally purchased in the
early twentieth century by Mr. Simcik’s grandparents, who farmed the area and whose two-story house
was approximately 150 yards north and up slope of the Elzner house. Mr. Simcik stated that his
grandparents’ two-story house was relocated around 1980 prior to the proposed expansion of
SH 286/Cross Town Expressway Project (V. Simcik 2009, personal communication).
Given the level of previous disturbances from the demolition and removal of buildings and infrastructure
associated with the former house site, the lack of an intact subsurface component, and soil and geologic
conditions that are not conducive to the preservation of intact archeological deposits, it is the opinion of
B&A that 41NU336 cannot provide any new or important historical information and no additional
investigations are recommended.
Site 41NU336
Site 41NU336 consists of a hydraulic automotive lift and associated concrete pad in the northwest
quadrant of the SH 286/FM 43 intersection approximately 350 feet north of FM 43 in a disturbed
construction staging area containing stockpiles of old asphalt, gravel, and concrete chunks (Figure 15).
The lift is about three feet tall and one-foot in diameter, while the associated concrete pad measures 30
feet north-south by 45 feet east-west (Figure 16). Presumably the lift has an associated subsurface vault
with a hydraulic tank. The lift has a machine tag stamped with 1947, although only recent debris was
observed in and around the site.
Subsurface investigations included the excavation of seven STs (23 through 29) (see Appendix A).
Shovel testing extended a maximum depth of 55 centimeters below ground surface in the dense upland
clays and revealed only road construction debris (e.g., asphalt, and oyster shell and gravel road base
aggregate) and miscellaneous modern plastic and glass fragments mixed from 0 to 20 centimeters below
ground surface. Other than the modern debris, shovel testing revealed no additional buried cultural
materials (see Appendix A).
During discussions with local resident D. Galloway (2009, personal communication) about the propane
company that had previously occupied the area where 41NU334 was recorded, it was indicated that there

had been a gas station/automotive garage on the north side of FM 43 in the northwest corner of the
SH 286/FM 43 intersection, which readily explains the presence of the automotive lift.
Given the level of previous disturbances from the demolition and removal of buildings and infrastructure
associated with the gas station/automotive garage, as well as the lack of an intact subsurface component,
and soil and geologic conditions that are not conducive to the preservation of intact archeological
deposits, it is the opinion of B&A that 41NU336 cannot provide any new or important information and,
therefore, no additional investigations are recommended.

SUM M A R Y A ND R E C OM M E NDA T I ONS
Intensive archeological survey efforts with track-hoe scraping and backhoe trenching in the SH 286 ROW
at Oso Creek discovered no evidence of additional historic burials associated with previously recorded
site 41NU254 or any previously unidentified prehistoric resources. Investigations revealed that the
majority of the SH 286 APE has experienced previous surface and subsurface disturbances from utilities,
erosion, flood/erosion control efforts utilizing the placement of clay fill, extensive agricultural plowing,
and roadway construction. Additional impacts include the previous demolition and removal of structures
and infrastructure with associated businesses previously located in the northwest and southwest quadrants
of the SH 286/FM 43 intersection. However, survey efforts did result in the discovery of mid- to latetwentieth century historical sites 41NU334, 41NU335, and 41NU336.
Given a lack of integrity from previous surface and subsurface disturbances and the removal/demolition
of the buildings and infrastructure related to the former propane company, B&A recommends that site
41NU334 is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation and, as such, the
proposed construction there should be allowed to proceed as planned without further investigations
because the proposed construction should not affect any SALs or archeological historic properties
pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1).
Given that the 1950s-era house was demolished and removed more than 30 years ago, the lack of
evidence for an associated intact subsurface component, and the poor structural integrity of associated
sub-features that do not exhibit any unusual construction techniques, B&A recommends that site
41NU335 is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation and, as such, the
proposed construction there should be allowed to proceed as planned there without further investigations
because the proposed construction should not affect any SALs or archeological historic properties
pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1).
Given a lack of integrity from previous surface and subsurface disturbances and the removal/demolition
of the buildings and infrastructure of the former gas station and automotive garage, B&A recommends
that site 41NU336 is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation and, as such,
the proposed construction should not affect any SALs or archeological historic properties pursuant to 36
CFR 800.4(d)(1).
Based on the above data, B&A recommends that the proposed project should be allowed to proceed as
planned without additional investigations, except in the southeast quadrant of the SH 286 crossing at Oso
Creek from the southern end of the SH 286 bridge to 300 feet south of the bridge. Although track-hoe
scraping in the southeast quadrant discovered no evidence of additional historical graves, the high density
of buried utilities there limited subsurface testing. Given those conditions, in conjunction with the fact
that 41NU254 was discovered in a utility trench in that quadrant of the creek crossing, B&A also
recommends that all subsurface utility relocations or reconstructions required for the planned expansion
of SH 286 in the southeast quadrant of the creek crossing, from the southern end of the SH 286 bridge to
300 feet south of the bridge, should be monitored by archeologists to ensure no additional historical
graves are present in areas where track-hoe scraping was not viable.

If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional easements or work space for the proposed construction,
then additional archeological investigations would be necessary in those areas. In the event that
previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area
of discovery would cease, and TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental
discovery procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA-TU and MOU.
