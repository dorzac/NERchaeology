ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the location of the site of a proposed dredge decant line
and drop structure in northern Calhoun County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) on April 30, 2003 and May 22, 2003 under United States
Army Corps of Engineers (COE) permit number 14045(6) with William E. Moore the
Principal Investigator. The site of the project area is a level coastal plain adjacent to a high
bluff overlooking Cox Bay to the south. No evidence of a prehistoric site was found within
the construction corridor of the dredge decant line or within the bluff face. It is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. Copies of this report
are on file at the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division; BVRA; the Texas
Archeological Research Library (TARL), and Alcoa World Alumina LLC Point Comfort
Operations in Port Lavaca, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
Alcoa World Alumina LLC has submitted plans for the construction of an alternate
dredge decant line and drop structure in northern Calhoun County, Texas to the United
States Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District for approval (Figure 1). The line will
consist of 18 inch high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe where it leaves two dredge
disposal areas and change to 20 inch pipe at the discharge area. This line will be placed
on the surface of the ground for a distance of 2500 feet and a width of 20 feet. The path of
this line is in an old sendero that has grown up in weeds and grass. Originally, it was
planned that the line would connect with two dredge disposal areas and transport the
decanted liquid south across the landscape to a drop structure designed to empty the
decanted liquid into the bay. At this time Alcoa is considering an alternative to the drop
structure. Instead of constructing a drop structure that will disturb the shoreline, matting
may be placed at the bluff edge to prevent erosion that would be caused by the flow of
water from the dredge decant line over the bluff edge into Cox Bay. No subsurface
disturbance of the bluff edge will occur as a result of the alternate plan.
Tiffany Terneny requested a Phase I cultural resources a professional archaeologist
conduct a cultural resources survey. In order to satisfy this requirement, Alcoa World
Alumina LLC retained BVRA to perform this service. The initial survey was carried out on
April 30, 2003 under COE permit 14045(6), and the subsurface investigation, as requested
by the COE) was performed on May 22, 2003 under the same permit. The area
investigated is depicted on the Point Comfort topographic quadrangle (Figure 2). The map
number is 2896-314, and it is dated 1995.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located in that region referred to by Hester et al. (1989:3) as the
South Texas Plains that extends from the Rio Grande to the Gulf of Mexico. The region
lies completely within the Tamaulipan Biotic Province as defined by Blair (1950). Annual
rainfall for Calhoun County averages 37.10 inches. The climate is mild with a mean
average temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit that results in a growing season of 292
days. Among the crops that have been important to the county in the past are cotton, corn,
grain, sorghums, flax, rice, and a wide variety of fruit and truck. The livestock industry
produces beef and dairy cattle, hogs, and poultry. Fish and shrimp from coastal waters
form a major part of the economy as well.
Thorny brush is the main vegetation encountered throughout the Tamaulipan Biotic
Province of Texas. The line of brush is less common as one travels from the coast
westward and available moisture declines. Blair (1950:103) lists certain species of plants
that account for the bulk of the brush vegetation in the area. The most important are
mesquite, various species of Acacia and Mimosa, granjeno, lignum vitae, cenizo, white
brush, prickly pear, tasajillo, and Castela.
The entire project area is located within one soil type, Midland clay loam (Mb). The
project area is depicted on Sheet 11 in the soil survey of Calhoun County (Mowery and
Bower 1978), and the following description is taken from this volume (Mowery and Bower
1978:20). This soil is typically found in slightly depressed uplands. A representative profile
consists of a surface layer of clay loam about 9 inches thick. The upper part is gray, and
the lower part is dark gray. The subsoil extends to a depth of 57 inches. Midland soils are
poorly drained and have a high available water capacity.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Calhoun County is located in the Central Coastal Plain as defined in a statistical
overview of Texas by Biesaart et al. (1988:76). In 1985 when the statistical overview was
published, 1067 sites (5.28% of the state) were recorded in the entire region. Only three of
the thirteen regions reported fewer sites or had a lower percentage statewide. In terms of
county statistics, Calhoun County was tied with Karnes County for eighth in the region with
48 recorded archaeological sites (Biesaart et al. 1985:90). Approximately half the sites in
the county (n=25) are listed as Late Prehistoric, while the remaining sites (n=17) are listed
as Archaic. In all, 41 of the known sites are described as disturbed by erosion, and 46
sites have been surface collected. Additional work in the county has resulted in an
increase of recorded sites. The number of recorded sites as of this investigation is 94
(TARL site files).
There is no evidence that the current project area has been investigated by
professional archaeologists. A "pilot" field survey on Cox Bay was performed by the
Environmental Planning Division of the General Land Office (Fritz 1972). This report was
not available at the time of this study; therefore, the level of work and number of sites
recorded (if any) is not known.
Major efforts have been undertaken in other areas such as Matagorda Bay to the
east. Investigations near the bay are discussed in detail by Fritz (1975) in a survey of the
archaeological and historical resources of Matagorda Bay. The nearest recorded site to
the current project area is a massive shell midden (41CL12) located on Cox Point over 1.2
kilometer to the southeast. Avocational archaeologist Cecil A. Calhoun recorded this site in
1968. He is referred to by Fritz (1975:14) as the most knowledgeable amateur in the area.
Mr. Calhoun (1970) independently prepared a list of 70 known archaeological sites in the
county for the Texas Highway Department. Site 41CL12 dates from the Middle Archaic to
possibly the Historic Period based on pottery types (Calhoun 1962) and the presence of a
clay pipe and fragments of metal. In 1970, when Calhoun prepared his list of sites for the
Texas Highway Department the site had undergone disturbance through water erosion as
part of the bluff had fallen into the bay.
In addition to the overview by Fritz (1975), other sources are recommended for
those interested in more information regarding the prehistory and history of Calhoun
County. These are a bibliography of the Southern Coastal Corridor (Bailey 1987) and a
volume discussing the archaeology and paleogeography of the Lower Guadalupe
River/San Antonio Bay Region (Weinstein 1992).

METHODS
Prior to conducting the field survey, a records check at TARL was conducted in
order to identify any previously recorded archaeological sites that might be affected by the
proposed construction. The Project Archaeologist discussed the field methods to be
employed with Tiffany T. Terneny and project representative Larry Onken.
The field investigation consisted of a 100% pedestrian survey designed to identify
the presence of cultural materials within the project area. During the planning stages of
this project, BVRA was informed that the dredge decant line would be buried to a
maximum depth of 36 inches. During the survey, however, the field crew was told that the
line would be placed on the surface. A bulldozer was utilized to clear the weeds and grass
that covered an old sendero created. The field crew then walked this sendero in both
directions looking for surface evidence of an archaeological site. The soil was observed to
be a black clay loam. Since no subsurface construction is planned for the dredge decant
line, shovel testing was not necessary. At the edge of the bluff, the crew cleaned the
surface of the eroded bluff face in order to better view the exposed profile for evidence of a
prehistoric site. Since no cultural materials were observed it was assumed that no site is
present or erosion has destroyed any evidence of a site that may have been present in this
area. Evidence of recent erosion is depicted in Figure 3. Therefore, backhoe trenching
was not considered necessary.
Acting on a request from the Corps of Engineers, the crew returned to the site area
on May 22, 2003 and excavated a trench at the bluff edge using a trackhoe (Figure 4).
This trench was 6 feet wide and 16 feet long at the top of the bluff. It was dug to a depth of
21 feet through black clay loam and red/yellow mottled clay. Excavation was terminated
when the trench reached the elevation of the shoreline. The purpose of this trench was to
expose a profile of the bluff. The crew examined the excavated soil for the presence of
features or other evidence of previous occupation in prehistoric times. The soil had to be
inspected by hand and visually as it was removed by the trackhoe, as it was too dense to
pass through a screen. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the profile and plan of the trackhoe
trench.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
According to the records check at TARL, no previously recorded sites are present
within the boundaries of the project area. In fact, there are no known archaeological sites
within 1.2 kilometer of the area to be investigated. Additionally, no sites in Calhoun County
are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark.
The field investigation did not locate evidence of a prehistoric site along the top of the bluff
overlooking Cox Bay where the dredge decant line is to be constructed. The erosion along
the bluff is active as evidenced by the change in the 15 foot contour line on the latest two
versions of the topographic map Point Comfort. In the 22 years between the 1952 version
(photorevised 1973) and the version used in this report (dated 1995), the 15 foot contour
line has receded at least 2000 feet. The mud flat below the bluff edge, as depicted on the
1995 version of the topographic map, is now much greater in size as a result of this
erosion.
At the time of this investigation a number of large, dead mesquite trees were
observed in the waters of Cox Bay at least 100 feet from the existing bluff edge (Figure 5).
It is known that the shoreline in the project area has receded approximately 20 feet in the
last 5-10 years. This statement was made by Larry Onken, a contractor to Alcoa and
former employee who has worked in the area since 1965. In an effort to prevent this
rampant erosion from damaging their plant, Alcoa has installed bulkhead along the
shoreline.
If any prehistoric sites existed on the bluff or shoreline in the past they have been
destroyed due to erosion, and any evidence of these sites is now under the waters of the
bay. The site of the proposed construction is viewed by BVRA as a low probability area for
the presence of significant archaeological sites.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No site is present in the project area. It is, therefore, recommended that Alcoa
World Alumina LLC be allowed to proceed with construction as planned. Should evidence
of a site be encountered during construction, work must cease in the area of the find until
the THC can assess the situation.
