Management Summary:
In February 2015, BURY Inc., (Client) contracted with Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc. (RKEI) to perform
a cultural resources survey of approximately 0.6-acres for the proposed expansion of Neenah Avenue
and associated detention pond in Austin, Williamson County, Texas. The project area is owned by the
City of Austin. Since the project area is currently owned by a political subdivision of the state, the
project falls under the Antiquities Code of Texas as administered by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC). The Code requires archaeological investigations prior to any ground disturbing activities that
occur in association with construction activities on property owned by a political subdivision of the
state.
Previous archaeological investigations within the vicinity of the Area of Potential Effect (APE) have
identified significant archaeological deposits near the study area. The purpose of the current survey was
to determine whether any of these deposits extend within the boundaries of the APE and would be
impacted by the planned road expansion. The project was carried out on June 1 and 8, 2015 under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7285. Dr. Steve A. Tomka served as Principal Investigator. Kristi Nichols
served as the Project Archaeologist.
Eight shovel tests were excavated within the APE. Surface visibility averaged 70% throughout the APE.
No buried or surface-exposed historic or prehistoric materials were encountered during the survey. The
previously recorded sites in the vicinity of the APE do not extend into the current project area. No
cultural material was collected over the course of the project. All project-related documents are
permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. The RKEI Project Archaeologist
concludes that no significant cultural deposits will be impacted by the proposed projects. Given the lack
of significant cultural deposits within the project APE, RKEI recommends that the project may proceed
as planned.

Chapter 1: Introduction and Area of Potential Effect
Raba Kistner Environmental (RKEI) was contracted by BURY Inc., (Client) to perform an intensive
cultural resources survey of approximately 0.6-miles for the proposed expansion of Neenah Avenue
Right-of-Way (ROW) and associated retention pond in Austin, Williamson County, Texas. Since the
project area is currently owned by a political subdivision of the state, the project falls under the
Antiquities Code of Texas as administered by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The archaeological
survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7170. Dr. Steve A. Tomka served as the
Principal Investigator and Kristi Nichols served as the Project Archaeologist.

The Area of Potential Effect
The Area-of-Potential Effects (APE) is located in Austin, Williamson County, Texas. The survey
encompasses approximately 0.6-acres along Neenah Avenue. The project area runs roughly west-east
and is bounded by W. Parmer Lane to the west, a residential subdivision to the south and a school and
church to the north (Figure 1-1). The current APE is located on the Jollyville (3097-234) USGS 7.5 Minute
Quadrangle Map (Figure 1-2). The APE begins 0.3 miles to the east of W. Parmer Lane and extends
approximately 0.6-miles along Neenah Avenue until its eastern terminus.
The City of Austin has proposed the widening of a 0.6-mile portion of Neenah Avenue and the
construction of a new, and enlargement of an existing, water quality detention pond found in the
project vicinity. The proposed plans call for the expansion of the ROW primarily along the southern side
of the roadway. Here, the ROW will be widened by 100 feet to accommodate another lane of traffic.
Along the north side of the existing roadway, the ROW will be widened only 30 feet to accommodate
improvements to the existing sidewalk. This narrow stretch of new ROW stretching along the northern
edge of the road has been heavily impacted during the original construction of the roadway. Therefore,
this portion of the new ROW was inspected only in the vicinity of the site which is known to exist north
of the road near its eastern terminus. Neenah Avenue is located approximately 1000-1500 feet north of
Davis Spring Branch, a small seasonal creek, in southwest Williamson County. The anticipated vertical
depth of impacts will range from 24-inches in most areas to six-feet below surface in localized areas to
be impacted by possible culvert replacements and/or water quality pond expansion.

Chapter 2: Environmental Setting
Project Area Setting
The project area is located in the south-central Texas geographic region. The region is bordered by the
Edwards Plateau to the north, the Rio Grande River to the south, the Gulf of Mexico coastline to the
east, and the Lower Pecos region to the west (Norwine 1995:138). A gently rolling landscape with
seasonal drainages dominates the landscape. Elevations across the project area range from
approximately 720 ft above mean sea level (amsl) near the northern end of the proposed project area,
to approximately 690 ft amsl at the APEâs southern end. Neenah Avenue is located approximately 1,0001,500 feet north of Davis Spring Branch, a small seasonal creek, in southwest Williamson County. Plum
Creek is the only drainage that flows directly through the APE.

Soils
The APE crosses both the Austin-Castephen-Houston Black Series and the Heiden-Houston Black Series.
The Austin-Castephen-Houston Black Series exhibits shallow to deep, gently- to moderately-sloping soils
over chalk or marly clay on Blackland Prairie uplands. The Heiden-Houston Black Series exhibits deep,
gently sloping to sloping soils over clay and shale; on uplands of Blackland Prairie (USDA 1982). This area
is dominated by three distinct soils: Houston Black clay, Branyon clay and Lewisville silty clay. The
Houston Black clay has 1 to 3 percent slopes and is composed of clay from 0-80 inches. Branyon clay has
0 to 1 percent slopes and is composed of clay from 0-80 inches. Lewisville silty clay has 1 to 3 percent
slopes and is composed of silty clay from 0-61 inches (USDA 1982).

Flora and Fauna
The project area is located near the intersection of the Balconian and Taumaulipan biotic provinces
(Blair 1950). Due to this location, there is a large number of both flora and fauna resources that
exemplifies the Austroiparian, Taumaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian and Texan biotic provinces.
There are three major geographic regions nearby the project area: the Edwards Plateau, the Blackland
Prairie, and the South Texas Plains. Trees, plants and grasses in this region include cedar (Juniperus
ashei), live oak (Quercus fusiformis), Texas mountain laurel (Sophora secundiflora), mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa), prickly pear (Optunia sp.), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), cat claw (Smilax bona-nox),
mustang grape (Vitis mustangensis), sotol (Dasylirion texanum), and Spanish dagger (Yucca sp.).
4

The fauna that inhabit the South Central Texas region includes at least 95 bird and 29 mammal species.
The area also contains a wide array of reptiles, fish and amphibians. Mammal species that were noted
along the ROW include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virgininana), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus audubonii), feral hog, domestic and
feral cat, and squirrel.

South Texas Climate
The climate in south-central Texas is humid subtropical with hot and humid summers. From May
through September, hot weather dominates with the cool season beginning around the first of
November and extending through March. Winters are typically short and mild with little precipitation.
Austin averages only 33 inches of rain per year (SRCC 2015; based on monthly averages from 1980 to
2010). Monthly temperature averages range between 52Â°F in January to 85Â°F in August.

Chapter 3: Culture Chronology and Previous Archaeology
Culture Chronology
The cultural history of South Central Texas spans approximately 11,500 years. Archaeologists have
divided the occupation of the region into four principal periods and several sub-periods: Paleoindian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. The periods are characterized by changes in climatic conditions,
distinct vegetation types and structure, and concomitant adaptive changes by human populations in
hunting and gathering technologies and strategies, general material culture, and at the tail end of the
cultural sequence, the arrival of non-indigenous populations. The standard summaries of the culture
chronologies of Central Texas accepted by many of the regional archaeologists were produced by Collins
(1995) and Prewitt (1981).

Below is a brief summary of the cultural sequence that has been

reconstructed by archaeologists for the south-central part of the State.
Paleoindian Period
The oldest cultural materials found in the region date to the Paleoindian Period. The period spans
roughly from 11,500-8800 B.P. (Collins 1995, 2004). The Aubrey site in Denton County has one of the
earliest occupations, with radiocarbon assays dating to between 11,542 Â± 11 B.P. (Before Present) and
11,590 Â± 93 B.P. (Bousman et al. 2004:48). Paleoclimatic proxy measures suggest that a cooler climate
with increased precipitation was predominant during the Late Pleistocene (Mauldin and Nickels 2001;
Toomey et al. 1993), the later portion of the period.
Initial reconstructions of Paleoindian adaptations typically viewed these hunter-gatherers as traversing
extreme distances in pursuit of now extinct mega-fauna such as mammoth and mastodon. While these
Paleoindians populations did exploit the Late Pleistocene mega-fauna when it was accessible, a number
of faunal assemblages from an increasingly larger number of sites indicate that the Paleoindian diet was
more varied and consisted of a wide range of resources, including small game and plants. The Lewisville
(Winkler 1982) and the Aubrey sites (Ferring 2001) produced faunal assemblages that represented a
wide range of taxa, including large, medium, and small species. Information on the consumption of
plant resources during the Paleoindian period is lacking. Bousman et al. (2004) reported that the late
Paleoindian component at the Wilson-Leonard site reflected the exploitation of riparian, forest and
grassland species. Analysis of Paleoindian skeletal remains indicates that the diets of the Paleoindian
and later Archaic hunter-gatherers may have been similar (Bousman et al. 2004; Powell and Steele
1994).
6

The early portion of the Paleoindian Period was characterized by the appearance of Clovis and Folsom
fluted projectile points that were used for hunting mega-fauna. Typical projectile points produced at
sites with occupations dating to the later portion of the Paleoindian period included the Plainview,
Dalton, Angostura, Golandrina, Meserve, and Scottsbluff types.

Meltzer and Bever (1995) have

identified 406 Clovis sites in Texas. One of the earliest, 41RB1, yielded radiocarbon assays that put the
maximum age for the Paleoindian component at 11,415 Â± 125 B.P. (Bousman et al. 2004:47).
Sites in Bexar County that contain Paleoindian components include St. Maryâs Hall (Hester 1978, 1990),
Pavo Real (Collins et al. 2003), the Richard Beene site (Thoms et al. 1996; Thoms and Mandel 2006) and
41BX1396 (Tomka 2012).

St. Maryâs Hall, 41BX229, was first encountered in 1972 during the

construction of a house just outside the schoolâs property. The Pavo Real site, 41BX52, is located along
Leon Creek in northwest Bexar County.

The site was first documented in 1970 and has been

investigated several times over the past 40 years (Collins et al. 2003). The Richard Beene site, 41BX831,
is located along the Medina River in southern Bexar County (Thoms et al. 1996). Site 41BX1396 is
located in Brackenridge Park in San Antonio, Texas, and was encountered during installations for lighting
in 2010. Dating of organic samples indicated that occupation at the site occurred as early as 10,49010,230 B.P.
Archaic Period
The Archaic Period dates between ca. 8800 to 1200 B.P. It is divided into three subperiods: Early,
Middle, and Late. During the Archaic, mobility strategies may have shifted to more frequent short
distance movements that allowed the exploitation of seasonal resource patches. The intermittent
presence of bison in parts of Texas, combined with changes is climatic conditions and the primary
productivity of the plant resources may have contributed to shifts in subsistence strategies and
associated technological repertoire. When bison was not present in the region, hunting strategies
focused on medium to small game along with continued foraging for plant resources. When bison was
available, hunter-gatherers targeted the larger-bodied prey on a regular basis.
Early Archaic
Collins (1995) suggests that the Early Archaic spans from 8800 to 6000 B.P. Projectile point styles
characteristic of the Early Archaic include Angostura, Early Split Stem, Martindale, and Uvalde (Collins
1995). The Early Archaic climate was drier than the Paleoindian Period and witnessed a return to

7

grasslands (Bousman 1998). Mega-fauna of the Paleoindian period could not survive the new climate
and ecosystems, therefore eventually dying out. Early Archaic exploitation of medium to small fauna
intensified.
The Wilson-Leonard excavation produced a wealth of cultural materials representative of a lengthy
period in regional prehistory. The projectile point assemblages from the site indicate that the lanceolate
Paleoindian point forms continue from the Paleoindian into the Early Archaic (Angostura). However,
relatively quickly during the Early Archaic, they are replaced by corner- and basally-notched and
shouldered forms (Early Triangular, Andice, Bell) that quickly become the dominant points tipping the
atlatl-thrown darts. In addition, the uses of small to medium hearths similar to the previous period were
noted too. The appearance of earth ovens suggests another shift in subsistence strategies. The earth
ovens encountered at the Wilson-Leonard site were used to cook wild hyacinth along with aquatic and
terrestrial resources (Collins et al. 1998). Analyses of Early Archaic human remains encountered in Kerr
County (Bement 1991) reveal diets low in carbohydrates in comparison to the Early Archaic populations
found in the Lower Pecos region.
Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic subperiod spans from 6000 to 4000 B.P. (Collins 1995; Weir 1976). Archaeological
data indicates that there appeared to be a population increase during this time. The climate was
gradually drying leading to the onset of a long drought period. Changes to the demographics and
cultural characteristics were likely in response to the warmer and more arid conditions. Projectile point
styles characteristic of this subperiod include Bell, Andice, Calf Creek, Taylor, Nolan, and Travis.
Subsistence during the Middle Archaic saw a greater reliance on nuts and other resources found in
riverine settings (Black 1989). The increased utilization of burned rock middens during the Middle
Archaic represented the greater role of plant resources in hunter-gatherer diets (Black 1989; Johnson
and Goode 1994). This trend suggests a broadening of the diet base resulting perhaps from a decrease
in availability of higher-ranked prey species, and in particular bison, during the period. Little is known
about burial practices during the Middle Archaic. An excavation in an Uvalde County sinkhole (41UV4)
contained 25-50 individuals (Johnson and Goode 1994:28).
Late Archaic
The Late Archaic spans from 4000 to 1200 B.P. (Collins 2004). It is represented by the Bulverde,

8

Pedernales, Kinney, Lange, Marshall, Williams, Marcos, Montell, Castroville, Ensor, Frio, Fairland and
Darl projectile points. The early part of the Late Archaic exhibited fluctuations in the temperature and
rainfall. There appears to have been an increase in population at this time (Nickels et al. 1998).
Some researchers believe that the use of burned rock middens decreased during the Late Archaic. The
peak in middens dating to the Late Archaic suggests, however, a contrary pattern, that is, the increased
reliance on hot rock-based plant processing during the period (Black and Creel 1997; Mauldin et al.
2003). Johnson and Goode (1994) discuss the role of burned rock middens in relation to acorn
processing.
Human remains from burials related to the Late Archaic in Central and South Texas suggest the region
saw an increase in population. This increase may have prompted the establishment of territorial
boundaries which resulted in boundary disputes (Story 1985). Human remains dating to this sub-period
have been encountered near the Edwardâs Plateau.
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric Period begins ca. 1200 B.P. (Collins 1995; Collins 2004), and appears to continue
until the beginning of the Protohistoric Period (ca. A.D. 1700). The term Late Prehistoric is used in
Central and South Texas to designate the time following the end of the Archaic Period. A series of traits
characterizes the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric Period. The main technological changes
were the shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery. The Late Prehistoric Period is
divided into two phases: the Austin and the Toyah.
At the beginning of this period, environmental conditions were deemed to be warm and dry. Moister
conditions appear after 1000 B.P. (Mauldin and Nickels 2001). Subsistence practices appeared similar to
the Late Archaic. Projectile points associated with the Austin Phase include the Scallorn and Edwards
types. The Toyah Phase is characterized by the prominence of the Perdiz point (Collins 1995).
Most researchers concur that the early portion of the Late Prehistoric period saw a decrease in
population density (Black 1989:32). Radiocarbon dates from some sites have indicated that the middens
were utilized during the Late Prehistoric. Some archaeologists suggest that the peak of midden use was
after A.D. 1 and into the Late Prehistoric (Black and Creel 1997:273). Radiocarbon dates from Camp
Bowie middens provide evidence that supports Black and Creelâs arguments that burned rock middens
were a primarily Late Prehistoric occurrence (Mauldin et al. 2003).
9

Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. This shift is characterized by
the introduction of blade technology, the first ceramics in Central Texas (bone-tempered plainwares),
the appearance of Perdiz arrow points, and alternately beveled bifaces (Black 1989:32; Huebner
1991:346). Prewitt (1981) suggests this technology originated in north-central Texas. Patterson (1988),
however, notes that the Perdiz point was first seen in southeast Texas by about 1350 B.P., and was
introduced to west Texas some 600 to 700 years later.
Early ceramics in Central Texas (ca. A.D. 1250 to 1300) are associated with the Toyah Phase of the Late
Prehistoric and are referred to as Leon Plain ware. The Leon Plain ceramic types are undecorated, bonetempered bowls, jars, and ollas with oxidized, burnished and floated exterior surfaces (Ricklis 1995).
There is notable variation within the type (Black 1986; Johnson 1994; Kalter et al. 2005). This variation
can be attributed to differences in manufacturing techniques and cultural affiliation. Analysis of
residues on ceramic sherds suggests that vessels were used to process bison bone grease/fat, mesquite
bean/bison bone grease and deer/bison bone grease (Quigg et al. 1993).
The return of bison to South and Central Texas during the Late Prehistoric resulted from a drier climate
in the plains located to the north of Texas and increased grasses in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak
Savannah in north-central Texas (Huebner 1991). The increased grasses in the two biotas formed the
âbison corridorâ along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau and into the South Texas Plain (Huebner
1991:354-355). Rock shelter sites, such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and
Classen Rock Shelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967), suggest a shift in settlement
strategies (Skinner 1981). Burials encountered that date to this period often reveal evidence of conflict
(Black 1989:32).
Historic Period
Spanish occupation in the Austin region was ephemeral throughout the Colonial Period. The first
account of the Spaniards utilizing the area was in 1730, at the time the three College of QuerÃ©taro
missions from East Texas relocated to escape the hostile frontier. The three missions, Nuestra Padre
San Francisco de los Tejas, Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n de los Ainais, and San JosÃ© de los
Nazonis, were removed to the Barton Springs area of Austin prior to settling in San Antonio (Habig
1990). While some of the missions were temporarily moved to Barton Springs, following their relocation
to the San Antonio River, Spanish presence was limited to infrequent expeditions that passed through
the region.
10

Moses Austin was given permission by the Spanish government to settle 300 families in the Brazos and
Colorado River valleys. The plans were delayed by his death in 1821. Mexicoâs independence from
Spain also hindered the settlement. Mosesâ son, Stephen F. Austin was able to take over the efforts and
arranged for a group of colonists to sail from New Orleans to the Brazos River (Weber 1982). Many of
the colonists that were part of the original Austin Colony settled in east Texas. Settlement began with
the establishment of a small village of Waterloo circa 1837, which would be renamed Austin to serve as
the Capital of Texas.
Waterloo was established on the banks of the Colorado River, near the present-day Congress Avenue
Bridge (Hazlewood 2015). The first resident was Jacob Harrell, who built a tent on the banks of the river
for his family. Harrell was a hunter who had come to the area in 1835. Mirabeau Lamar visited with
Harrell sometime in 1837 or 1838 to inspect the area as a possible location of the Capital of Texas.
Lamar liked what he saw and sent a surveyor to lay out a town in 1838. During the time that Harrell
erected a tent and the commission appointed by President Lamar arrived in 1839, Harrell had
constructed a split-level stockade. Four additional families had settled near the stockade by the time
the commission arrived. The commission named the site Waterloo. Congress later agreed for the
location to become the Capital, and designated that the city would be called Austin. Approximately
7,735-acres were relinquished by Harrell and the four other families for the Capital (Hazlewood 2015).
The current APE is located approximately 20 miles north of Austin, Texas. The earliest settlement in the
vicinity was Jollyville, a town established in 1866 by John Grey Jolly (Odintz 2015). The town remained
fairly small for the first several decades. It wasnât until the late 1940s that Jollyville exceeded 100
residents (Odintz 2015). The population jumped to 15,000 in the 1990s, due to the construction of new
subdivisions and business.

Previous Archaeology
Multiple archaeological surveys have been conducted in the vicinity of the project area. Pedestrian
surveys surrounding the APE date back to at least 1984. One of these surveys was carried out for the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This survey covered the western end of the current project
area, but since it was completed thirty years ago, under significantly different guidelines than those of
today, a re-survey of the project area was warranted (Figure 3-1). Eight archaeological sites lie within a
one-kilometer radius of the APE: 41WM559, 41WM560, 41WM561, 41WM562, 41WM566, 41WM713,
11

41WM935, and 41WM1221. The boundaries of two of these sites, 41WM560 and 41WM561, may
expand into the proposed project area (Figure 3-2).

In March 1984, Prewitt and Associates conducted a survey for the Environmental Protection Agency
(THC 2015) and recorded Site 41WM559. The current APE appears to cross-cut the eastern and western
portions of the current APE. A diffused lithic scatter that lacked temporally diagnostic artifacts was
identified on site during the initial visit. Prewitt and Associates returned to the site in 1986, focusing on
the southwest corner of the site where a lithic concentration was encountered a. The concentration
included chert cobbles, chunks, cores, debitage, and bifaces (THC 2015). In 1991, TxDOT archaeologists
revisited the site to prepare for the construction of a subdivision and a nearby water treatment facility.
Again, chert cobbles and debitage were encountered (THC 2015).

A visit to 41WM559 in 2000 by SWCA, Inc. encountered Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric projectile points
as well as bifaces, unifaces, scrapers, cores, debitage, burned clay, and burned rock. Metate fragments
were noted on the surface and in shovel tests. The site was determined to be eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places and formal designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) in 2000
(THC 2015. SWCA estimated that the entire site was approximately 127 acres, and was separated into
three sections.

Site 41WM560 was recorded by Prewitt and Associates Inc., during their 1984 survey (THC 2015). The
site is located just to the north of the current project ROW in the eastern portion of the APE, under the
Holy Family Catholic School. The site was recorded as an unknown temporal affiliation prehistoric lithic
scatter that contained debitage, tested cobbles, a chopper, and a mano. The site was determined to not
be eligible for listing on the NRHP or for formal designation as a SAL due to the scarcity of artifacts and
the lack of diagnostic material.

The 1984 survey conducted by Prewitt and Associates also resulted in the documentation of Site
41WM561. The site is located to the south of the current APE, and Altona Way currently passes through
the site boundary. 41WM561 was a prehistoric lithic scatter and workshop containing cores, debitage,
and one early-reduction stager biface. The site was determined to not be eligible for listing on the NRHP
or formal designation as a SAL due to the paucity of artifacts and the lack of diagnostic materials (THC
2015).

In 2005, ACI carried out a linear survey 0.7-kilometers to the west of the project area (Ralph and Nash
2005). No new archaeological sites were encountered during this survey. In 2009, Horizon
14

Environmental carried out a survey of 181 acres approximately 0.6 km to the east of the project area
(Owens 2009). Two archaeology sites were recorded during the survey, only one of which, 41WM1221,
is within a 1-km radius of the APE.

Chapter 4: Methods of Investigation
Field Methods
The project area consists of a 0.6 mile-long proposed new ROW along Neenah Avenue located in Austin,
Williamson County, Texas. The proposed project will result in the widening of Neenah Avenue along
both the northern and southern margins and the potential increase in the size of the retention pond
that is found near its southeastern terminus. As part of the intensive pedestrian survey of the APE, RKEI
utilized a combination of surface reconnaissance, and shovel testing to search for shallowly buried
archaeological deposits. No backhoe trenching was proposed due to the fact that previous surveys
mention only shallow soils in the APE and a sloping terrain where sheet-wash tends to remove and
redeposit soils and artifacts rather than being conducive to in-situ burial of artifacts.

Shovel Testing
The archaeological survey consisted of a pedestrian survey of 100 percent of the project APE. The
pedestrian survey was accompanied by shovel testing at intervals along the ROW. All shovel tests were
approximately 30 cm in diameter and, unless prevented by obstacles or buried features, extended to a
depth of 60 centimeters below surface (cmbs). Each shovel test was excavated in 10-cm increments. All
soil from each level was screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Any encountered artifacts recovered
were to be labeled with appropriate provenience information for laboratory processing and analysis. A
shovel test form was completed for each excavated shovel test. Data collected from the shovel test
included the final excavation depth, a tally of all materials encountered from each 10-cm level, and a
brief soil description (texture, consistency, Munsell color, inclusions). The location was recorded using a
Garmin, hand-held, GPS unit. Shovel test locations were sketched onto a current aerial photograph of
the APE as a backup to the GPS information. Any additional observation considered pertinent was
included as comments on the standard shovel test excavation form.

Laboratory Methods
All project related documentation produced during the survey was prepared in accordance with federal
regulation 36 CFR Part 79, and THC requirements for State Held-in-Trust collections. Field notes, field
forms, photographs, and field drawings were placed into labeled archival folders and converted into
electronic files. Digital photographs were printed on acid-free paper, labeled with archivally appropriate
materials, and were placed in archival-quality plastic sleeves when needed. All field forms were
16

completed with pencil. Ink-jet produced maps and illustrations were placed in archival quality plastic
page protectors to prevent against accidental smearing due to moisture. A copy of the report and all
digital materials were saved onto a CD and stored with field notes and documents. All project-related
documentation will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

Chapter 5: Results of Investigation
On June 1 and 8, 2015, RKEI staff performed a pedestrian survey of the 0.6 mile Neenah Avenue ROW in
Austin, Texas. The survey consisted of the visual inspection of the ground surface for cultural materials
and shovel testing at locations thought to be undisturbed by recent construction and to have more than
a couple of inches of topsoil. Eight shovel tests were placed along the project ROW; six (STs 1-6) were
excavated along the southern margin of Neenah Road and two (ST7 and ST 8) were positioned within a
fenced area surrounding a water retention pond (Figure 5-1).

Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
The northern margin of the Neenah Avenue ROW has been severely impacted by the installation utilities
(Figure 5-2; water line and electrical conduits). In addition, a concrete sidewalk is located along the
entire length of the ROW and the sidewalk extends within six-inches of the edge of the ROW. Therefore,
it was decided that shovel testing along this portion of the ROW would encounter primary disturbed
soils and therefore, no STs were excavated.

Figure 5-2. Utility installations along northern edge of Neenah Avenue. Also note sidewalk and drainage
ditch that runs along the outer edge of the APE.
The ROW along the southern margin of the APE also contained a sidewalk. The western portion of the
APE contained no areas within the ROW where a shovel test could be excavated in undisturbed soils.
Property fences in the area extended nearly to the edge of the sidewalk (Figure 5-3) and a gas line was
installed between the fence line and the sidewalk along portions of the ROW that were wider.

20

Figure 5-3. Edge of ROW near western end of the APE. Note the proximity of the property fences to
sidewalk.
The project ROW is wider along the eastern half of its southern margin and therefore it provided more
opportunities to examine the ROW for the presence of cultural deposits. In addition, surface visibility
ranged from 60 to 80 percent throughout the area. A series of drainages and a water retention pond
are located along the southern ROW in the eastern portion of the APE. But even here, however,
drainage improvements have impacted portions of the APE. For instance, several drainage culverts
constructed of concrete and cut limestone blocks are present in this stretch of the APE (Figure 5-4) and
the driveway to the water detention pond its banks are lined with a thick layer of limestone to reduce
the chances of significant erosion (Figure 5-5).

21

Eight shovel tests were excavated within the eastern 2/3rds of the southern margin of the project area.
Six of these (STs 1-6) were excavated near the sidewalk that ran along the edge of the street. Here, the
distance between property boundaries and the sidewalk ranged from 8-12 feet. The remaining two
units (ST 7 and ST 8) were dug on the margins of a detention pond that may be enlarged if design
requirements necessitate such actions.

Four of the six shovel tests reached the designated 60

centimeters below surface (cmbs). The remaining two were located near Solera Drive and Altera Way,
and were excavated to 30 and 20 cmbs, respectively. Bedrock prevented their excavation to the
intended terminal depth.
Shovel Tests 1 through 3 were the three most easterly units excavated during the project. A layer of
silty clay formed the uppermost deposit across the eastern terminus of the project (7.5YR4/6). This
layer extends to 40 cmbs in ST 1 before the soil changes to dark gray (7.5YR4/1) compact and blocky
clay. A layer of chert cobbles was present in Level 5 (40-50 cmbs) near the bottom of the level but none
of the pieces were culturally modified. (Figure 5-6). Between 50 and 60 cmbs, the soil remained dark
brown clay, but the density of chert fragments decreased. Shovel Test 1 produced no cultural material.

Figure 5-6. Shovel Test 1, note construction fill at top of ST.
23

Shovel Tests 2 and 3 were placed approximately 15 meters east and west of Shovel Test 1. ST 2 was
excavated to a terminal depth of 50 cmbs, where large tree roots were encountered from former trees
that grew in the area. Shovel Tests 2 and 3 were excavated to 60 cmbs. The soils encountered in these
two units consisted of silty clay (7.5 YR 4/6) in the upper 10 centimeters followed by dark gray to black
clay (10YR5/6 through the reminder of the units. The same layer of natural chert cobbles was noted
near the bottom of Level 5 (40-50 cmbs) in both units.

Neither of the two units produce cultural

materials.
Shovel Test 4 was excavated to the east of the water retention pond (Figure 5-1). It was excavated to a
terminal depth of 60 cm below surface. The upper silty clay layer capped a layer of dark brown clay.
This clay contained chert gravels and cobbles.

None exhibited cultural modifications upon field

examination. The dark brown clay transitioned to black clay in Level 5 (40-50 cmbs), and continued to
the base of the unit. No cultural material was encountered during the excavation of Shovel Test 4.
Shovel Test 5 was located between Solara Drive and Altona Way. The area has been landscaped with
trees, grasses, and shrubs. Each tree base was surrounded by a ring of mulch. The unit was excavated
to a terminal depth of 30 cmbs. At approximately 13 cmbs, caliche road base was encountered. The
matrix consisted of about 60 percent gravel with a light tan soil. Excavation of Shovel Test 5 continued
to 30 cmbs, at which point the road base was so compact that it could not be penetrated (Figure 5-7).
No cultural material was encountered in Shovel Test 5.

24

Figure 5-7. Road base in Shovel Test 5.
Shovel Test 6 was placed in the landscaped area between Altona Way and Olive Hill Drive. Dense St.
Augustine grass was present on the surface. The upper 10 cm consisted of dark brown clay loam with
many roots. At 13 cmbs, bedrock was exposed in the northern portion of the shovel test. Excavation of
the shovel test continued to 21 cmbs, where bedrock was present throughout the unit (Figure 5-8).
Shovel Test 6 was terminated at 21 cmbs, and no cultural material was encountered.

25

Access to the water detention pond was obtained to allow for the investigation of the area. The surface
reconnaissance of the general vicinity of the pond identified no cultural materials that would have been
disturbed during the grading of the surface to create the depression. It was also noted during the
reconnaissance that the interior of the pond exhibited both concrete drainage culverts (Figure 5-9) and
a layer of limestone cobbles that likely was added to reduce the potential for erosion if and when the
pond was to overflow (Figure 5-10).

Figure 5-9. Interior of water detention pond, note concrete culvert outlet.

Figure 5-10. Interior of water detention pond, note rocks lining edge of pond.
26

Excavation of the shovel tests in the water detention pond enclosure focused on the southern edges
where the ground surface was more easily accessible. Shovel Test 7 encountered chert cobbles and
gravels from 15 to 30 cmbs. Bedrock was encountered at 45 cm below the surface (Figure 5-12).

Figure 5-11. Bedrock encountered in Shovel Test 7.
Shovel Test 8 was located to the west of the concrete drain leading into the pond. Soil stratigraphy was
similar to Shovel Test 7. Chert cobbles and gravels were encountered between 5 and 25 cm below the
surface. Bedrock was encountered at 40 cmbs. Neither of the shovel tests excavated within the water
detention pond enclosure produced cultural material.

Chapter 6: Summary and Recommendations
In June of 2015, RKEI conducted a pedestrian survey of a 0.6 mile segment of Neenah Avenue in Austin,
Williamson County, Texas. The survey was conducted in preparation for the proposed widening of
Neenah Avenue. The project area had been previously impacted by the installation of utility and water
lines, as well as the construction of concrete sidewalks along both sides of the street. The northern
ROW of Neenah Avenue was disturbed by the sidewalk and utilities and there was only a narrow strip of
ground adjacent to the utility easements where shovel testing would have been feasible. Given the
limited available space, and the likelihood that it was also disturbed by construction, no shovel tests
were excavated along this portion of the APE. In contrast, eight shovel tests were excavated along the
southern portion of the APE, positioned primarily along the eastern half of the ROW, where the
likelihood of encountering undisturbed cultural deposits was greater due to the wider easement.
The shovel tests encountered both colluvial deposits and intact soils in the eastern portion of the APE.
Bedrock was encountered in the two shovel tests (STs 7 and 8) that were excavated within the water
detention pond. Much of the surface of the detention pond was lined with limestone cobbles in an
effort to reduce potential erosion in case of heavy rain events. Along the western portion of the APE,
disturbances resulting from sidewalk construction, utilities and culvert installation, as well as the
narrowness of the easement prevented the excavation of shovel test units.
No cultural material was encountered within the vicinity of the previously recorded sites. The lack of
cultural material indicates that sites 41WM559 and 41WM560 do not extend into the current APE. No
new sites were encountered during the course of the survey.
Much of the ROW within the APE was highly disturbed by the installation of multiple utility, gas, water,
sewer, and telecommunication lines. The lack of cultural features or any surface exposed and buried
cultural materials, combined with the extensive disturbances within the APE, indicates that there are no
undisturbed significant cultural deposits that will be impacted by the proposed projects. Therefore, RKEI
recommends that no further investigations are needed at this time, and the planned improvements can
proceed as scheduled. If cultural materials are encountered during the construction and disturbance
activities, work should cease in the immediate area and the proper authorities notified.
additional changes be made to the project area, further work may be required.
