ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a 47 acre tract on the Texas A&M University campus in
Brazos County, Texas was conducted in February of 1996 by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas under the supervision of William E. Moore. The
area was investigated using the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing.
No prehistoric site or significant historic remains were found within the project area. It is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. The final report and
field notes will be provided to the Office of Facilities Planning and Construction, The
Texas A&M University System, and the Department of Antiquities Protection, Texas
Historical Commission. Copies of these documents are also on file at Brazos Valley
Research Associates for the interested researcher. A copy of the final report will also
be given to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates was retained by the Facilities Planning and
Construction Department, Planning Division, of The Texas A&M University System
(TAMUS) to conduct a cultural resources survey for the proposed West Campus Street
Improvement (TAMUS Project Number 1-2777) and Athletic Facilities
Renovation/Addition - Phase II projects (TAMUS Project Number 1-2784) on the
university campus in central Brazos County (Figure 1).
The project area consists of 47 acres and is bordered on all sides by TAMUS
property (Figure 2). No federal regulatory agency is involved in this project which will be
reviewed at the State level by the Department of Antiquities Protection (DAP), Texas
Historical Commission (THC). Since this project is being supported by state funds and
is located on land controlled by Texas A&M University, an Antiquities Permit from DAP
was required and permit number 1651 was awarded to this project. The project number
assigned by BVRA is 96-01. The project area is depicted on the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) topographical map, Wellborn dated 1916 and photorevised
1980 (Figure 3).
The nearest water source is White Creek. The main channel of this drainage
crosses the western corner of the project area and a small tributary or recent gully
parallels the northwestern boundary (Figure 2). The close proximity of the project area
to this creek makes it a likely location for a prehistoric or historic site. In fact, two
prehistoric sites (41BZ124 and 41BZ125) are located on this drainage just to the south
of the current project area. These sites were recorded during a recent survey of the
Bush Presidential Library Center site that is adjacent and to the southwest of the current
project area (Figure 2).
Wetlands delineation and an assessment of endangered plants and animals is
part of this investigation. Biologist, Steiner Charles Kierce, performed these tasks.
Although his work is independent of the archaeological survey and his reports will be
submitted as separate documents, the biological and archeological manuscripts will be
maintained as one file and be available to other researchers.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
The field survey was supplemented by a check of records housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas and an examination of
archaeological site reports, county histories, and other manuscripts. The records at
TARL were checked for a listing of known sites in the project area. In addition, all
previous investigations in Brazos County were identified. All background research was
done by the Principal Investigator. The area was examined in the field by means of a
pedestrian survey with William E. Moore acting as Principal Investigator. The field
survey was performed by Michael R. Bradle who was the Project Archeologist and
Floyd Kent under the direct supervision of the Principal Investigator. The entire tract
was walked by the field crew and Principal Investigator. Surface visibility was estimated
to be between 0-25%.
In terms of prehistoric site location, White Creek and its small tributary or gully
are the areas of highest probability. Therefore, shovel tests were concentrated along
this drainage and the small tributary or gully of this drainage, randomly across the
project area, and in areas where historic materials were observed. All excavated fill
was screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth and data obtained from shovel testing
were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I). In all 22 shovel tests were dug and
each test was backfilled. Shovel tests were dug to clay. They averaged 30 centimeters
in diameter and varied in depth from clay at the surface to 51 centimeters below the
existing ground surface. In addition, 25 shovel probes were dug throughout the project
area. These probes helped identify areas for formal shovel tests, were not screened,
and are not included on the shovel test log. When exposure was favorable, the creek
bank was examined for cultural materials. Basic soil descriptions were taken from Soil
Conservation Service (SCS) soil surveys published for the area obtained at the local
SCS office (Mowery et al. 1958). This office is now referred to as the United States
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. Field notes were
taken by the Project Archaeologist and the Principal Investigator. A computer
generated map of the project area was provided by The Texas A&M University System,
Department of Facilities Planning and Construction.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). This
physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acid sandy loams or
sands. The climate is subhumid to humid and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for the county is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees and a July maximum temperature of 95 degrees
combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:180). The
altitude varies from 200-400 feet. The project area is located on a tract of land that is
bisected in part by White Creek and a tributary or 5-gully. Elevations vary from 300 feet
along the lower creek terraces to 330 feet on the higher terraces away from this
drainage. According to the soil survey for Brazos County published in 1958 (Mowery et
al. 1958:Sheet 31), two soil types are found within the project area. They are Tabor fine
sandy loam (Ta), 1 to 3 percent slopes and Lufkin fine sandy loam (Lc), 0 to 1 percent
slopes.
The soils of the Tabor series are of moderate to low productivity and occur on
gently sloping uplands in most parts of the county. Soils in this series were developed
from alkaline to slightly acid sandy clay. The native vegetation consists of a scrubby
hardwood forest and an understory of shrubs and vines and a thin stand of bunch grass
(Mowery et al. 1958:13). In the project area this soil is found along White Creek and its
tributary.
The Lufkin series consists of moderately fertile, crusty claypan soils that occur on
nearly level to sloping upland soils throughout most of the county and are the most
extensive soils in the area. These soils were developed from alkaline to weakly
calcareous clay and sandy clay. Sandy mounds occur in many areas but seldom
occupy 10 percent of the total area. These mounds range from 1 to 3 feet in height and
from 20 to 60 feet in diameter. Native vegetation is post oak-savannah woodland with a
thin undergrowth of coarse bunchgrass (Mowery et al. 1958:8). In the project area
these soils are found in the uplands.
Although the soils in Brazos County are being reevaluated, the field survey
appeared to confirm the soils in the project area are at least similar to the Tabor fine
sandy loam and Lufkin fine sandy loam as described above.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been
recorded in the project area. There was also no indication that any part of the 47 acre
tract had been surveyed by professional archaeologists. Several archaeological
studies, however, have been conducted along White Creek in recent years (see
discussion in Previous Investigations) above. Aerial photography present in the Soil
Survey of Brazos County, Texas taken in the 1950s (Mowery et al. 1958:Sheet 31)
depicts a tract that is partly wooded and crossed by several roads or trails. Personal
communication with Dan H. Kennedy, P.E. of Facilities, Planning and Construction
(TAMUS) revealed that the project area has been owned by the University since the late
1800s. During this time it has been utilized for various agricultural activities such as
farming and grazing; these activities extending at times to the bank of the creek.
No prehistoric sites were found in the project area. The soils were shallow with
the deepest shovel test encountering clay at only 51 centimeters. The majority of the 22
shovel tests contained only 20-30 centimeters of sandy loam above clay with an
average of 26 centimeters of sandy loam above clay. It is, therefore, assumed that this
segment of White Creek was not a desirable location for prehistoric settlement.
Evidence of recent historic activities and disturbance was present over the entire
47 acre tract and included manhole covers, underground electric wires, pipeline routes,
and a brick concentration in the southwest corner of the project area on the east side of
White Creek (Figure 2). This feature consists of a depression in the ground with some
intact brick walls. The bricks in this concentration are not new and may be as old as 50
years. The area was shovel tested and no historic artifacts were recovered. It seems
likely that this brick feature may be related to some of the various agricultural activities
that have taken place on this tract prior to this study. Because of its disturbed condition
and absence of associated historic artifacts, the exact function of this feature may never
be known. This feature does not warrant official designation to State Archeological
Landmark (SAL) status and is not considered eligible for listing on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP).
The easternmost portion of the project area has been severely impacted by
dredging, bulldozing, and other forms of mechanical alteration. A large spoil pile stands
in marked contrast to the lower surrounding areas. It appears that the ditch along the
road has continually been dredged in order to maintain adequate drainage for run-off.
Evidence of disturbance was also observed when small pockets of clay interspersed
with the silty sand deposits were found during shovel testing. The upland area has been
used for various forms of agriculture by the previous owner and later by the university.
Given the shallow nature of the topsoil, the entire upland area away from the creek has
been significantly disturbed.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is the opinion of Brazos Valley Research Associates that there are no
significant cultural resource sites present in the 47 acre project area. Overall, the tract
is very disturbed and any site present would most certainly lack in situ deposits. As a
result of this investigation, it is recommended that Texas A&M University be allowed to
proceed with construction as planned. It is always possible that cultural materials are
missed during any cultural resources survey. Should additional areas containing
prehistoric or historic artifacts not discussed in this report be discovered during
construction, the Department of Antiquities Protection must be notified immediately and
work stopped until the situation can be evaluated.
