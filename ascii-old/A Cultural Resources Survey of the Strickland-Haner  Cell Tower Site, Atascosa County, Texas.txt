Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint and access right-of-way of
the proposed TX-19109 Strickland-Haner Cellular Tower site in south-central Atascosa County,
Texas. The Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA;
47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an
undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent review of this archaeological
report was provided by the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeology Division. The total area
to be impacted is 10,000 square feet (<0.23 acres), in addition to a 30-foot wide Access/Utility
Easement.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on January 14, 2015. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

Introduction
AARCHER, Inc. is
the consulting firm
employed to acquire
clearance for the
erection of the TX19109 StricklandHan er C e l l u l ar
Tower to be
constructed in
south-central
Atascosa County,
Texas (Figures 13), and hereinafter
occasionally

A A R C H E R
contracted with
Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological
Investigations
(TAAI) to conduct
an archaeological
investigation of the
proposed tower site. Figure 1. Location of the Project Area and Atascosa County.
Although no public funding was involved in the proposed development of the property, the
Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR
Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking.
In January 2015, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or within
one mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area.
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area.

Modern Environmental Setting
Climate and Vegetation
Atascosa County is located in south-central Texas mid-way between the Gulf of Mexico to the
east, and the Rio Grande to the west (see Figure 1). The generally flat to rolling terrain ranges
in elevation from about 150-700 feet above mean sea level. Clayey and loamy soils support the
growth of small predominately mesquite trees, and thorny scrub brush with assorted cacti,
chaparrel, and grassy understory. With its semi-arid environment, the county is generally frostfree from mid-February through early December, allowing for a 290-day growing season. The
average annual rainfall is about 24 inches. However, rainfall amounts vary significantly from
year to year, and the high evapotranspiration effects in the area effectively offset any beneficial
surplus of annual rainfall. This is another reason irrigation systems are so necessary, and
commonly found in use today throughout the area. Summers are indeed hot and dry, with
temperatures consistently hovering above 980F, although humidity is generally low compared
to environments closer to the Gulf Coast. Overall, the area’s climate can be classified as
subtropical steppe (Leffler 1996; Peterson 1996).
Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande are the major southeasterly trending rivers draining the
South Texas region. A subtle divide through the county causes numerous intermittent creeks to
flow south into the Nueces River, and others to drain toward the north, and into the Frio River.
Many drainages intermittently flow into both rivers during infrequent seasonal periods of
abundant rainfall. Although there are many springs in Atascosa County, very few are active due
primarily to the dip of the substrate shales which carry these subterranean seeps to the south and
east. Ancient springs that may have existed in the area at one time have likely succumbed to
overgrazing and irrigation pumping during modern times (Brune 1981). During our investigation
of the project area in January 2015, we observed no flowing or standing water.
Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation area as defined by
Gould (1975), and the regional flora of South Texas has been classified as being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic province extending out from northeast Mexico (Figures 4 and 5). This is the
only part of Texas where some vegetation exhibits growth throughout the year (Blair 1950; Map
2015). Thorny brush is the dominant vegetation today, but this is a relatively recent occurrence,
with a mix of woody and grassland species providing a savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989; Hester 1980; Inglis 1964). The original vegetation was an open
grassland mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and ash were common along perennial
streams. Due in part to overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the invasion of woody species has
changed the vegetation into “Texas brush country” dominated by mesquite, acacia, spiny

whitebrush,

others (Diamond
et al. 1987:203221). On sandy

leptocaulis), and
species of Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country exhibits some of the greatest mammalian species
diversity in the state. Sixty-one species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards, and several species
of turtles, salamanders, and frogs are present in the region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50
species of fish have been identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment
of south Texas is as
varied as the landscape,
and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record
contains significant gaps
primarily due to the
scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and welldated deposits (Stahle
and Cleaveland
1995:51). To date, the
best record of
paleoenviron-mental
reconstruction in South
Texas has been
accomplished by
Robinson (1982) from
analysis of phytoliths
f r o m
t h r e e
archaeological sites in
Live Oak County.
Overall, the data there
along with data from
Figure 5. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.
other sites in Texas
suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or late-glacial period, marked a transition from a
cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with
intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the
5

present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The Strickland-Haner project lies within the South Texas Archaeological region as defined by
Hester (1980, 1995, 2004; Figure 6). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is
problematic, due to the compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of
stratified sites excavated within the region. Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of
information that exists for south Texas and as such offers only a “general framework” for
prehistoric periods particular to the region (Figure 6). All dates are given as approximate years
before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of
Clovis-type points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no
camp sites or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
6

Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting
was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as
deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked
rock cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic
groups were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are
thinly distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including
most of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low
during the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
“few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization
of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla,
as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased
population, based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125,
128). On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as
prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit.
Weir (1976) believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began
to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the
intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers
believe burned rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976).
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological
sites in south Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic
(Dillehay 1974). Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a
movement toward less mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating
to the south Texas Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between
ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
7

Transitional Archaic (2250 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of
the Late Archaic is frequently
referred to as the Terminal
Archaic or Transitional
Archaic. Turner et al. (2011)
ci t e d a t a pl aci ng t he
Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although
Hester may lump current data
into a Late Archaic period, he
cautions that more evidence
will likely result in what may
be termed as a “Terminal
Archaic” period during the
latter part of the Late Archaic
in south Texas. This Terminal
Archaic period is represented
by diagnostics such as Ensor,
Frio, and Matamoras points
which appear to overlap the
Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods (Hester
1995:442). Weir (1976)
believes this marked a
transition period to localized
area sites, a disappearance of
burned rock middens and bison,
and a reappearance of highly
mobile hunters and gatherers.
Others (Black and McGraw
1985; Peter 1982; Skelton
1977) argue that in some
locations burned rock middens
did not disappear and sites were
more intensely occupied during
the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420
B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is
commonly used to designate
the period following the Late

Figure 6. South Texas cultural chronology.
8

Archaic in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the
period between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits
mark the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift
to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South
Texas Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a
nonstandard manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the
ones that best suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core
reduction and the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology
is a continent-wide phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah
assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
9

period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans
were rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.
Atascosa County Prehistory and History
Because of its modern political association, the prehistory and history of Atascosa County share
the same affinities with most of South Texas. That is, diagnostic dart and arrow points found
within the county suggest that the area has been occupied over the past 11,000 years (Atlas 2015;
Peterson 1996). Historical accounts indicate that Coahuiltecan-speaking Native Americans
inhabited the land in the 16th and 17th centuries, followed by the arrival of Comanche and Lipan
Apache groups.
By the 1750s, large ranches were established in the area by ranchers encroaching from northern
Mexico. Although the Lower Presidio “Royal Road, or Camino Real” passed through the area,
no permanent structures are known to exist prior to about the 1840s, when Anglo settlers began
to occupy the area. By 1856, the area was still sparsely populated, but sufficiently so that
10

Atascosa County was cut out of Bexar County. Through the 1850s, Indian depredations and poor
roads kept the local population limited, and at bay.
Following the Civil War, the area thrived on ranching and cattle production. This enticed not
only Mexicans from south of the border, but also an influx of Germans and Englishmen. In 1881,
an extension of the Great Northern Railway provided for a railhead at Lytle. Farm production
also increased accordingly, with corn and cotton being the main cash crops. However, ranching
rhas been the staple in Atascosa County over the past 150 years, and is only being surpassed in
more recent years by the production of oil and gas (Peterson 1996).

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review

The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.
Prehistoric Site Potential
Without written or oral accounts before the 1700s, it is difficult or impossible to truly say what
bands or tribes were within the modern political boundaries of Atascosa County before then.
Only cultural affiliations can be assigned to those groups, equating their technologies and
apparent lifestyles to the successive Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods.
Archaeologists have documented an assundry of prehistoric archaeological sites, including large
open campsites that are most commonly located along stream or river terraces with numerous
campfires, where a wide variety of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and butchered
animal remains are found. Where gravels outcrop, either along eroded streambeds, or on higher
terrain where more ancient gravels are sometimes exposed in isolated pockets, one can expect
11

stone chipping stations, or prehistoric quarries.
Historic Site Potential
The earliest historic accounts of Native Americans in south Texas and perhaps the Atascosa
County area, are those of Cabeza de Vaca. In the 1500s, Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
traversed parts of southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling
among the hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Covey 1961). His account of
his experiences in 1533–34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether
themselves to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter, and summer,
occasionally sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many
groups would live near each other in the semiarid environs of south Texas to harvest prickly pear
pads and other succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–37).
By the 1540s and 1550s, Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico with
thousands of cattle, and using Native Americans as slave labor. This encroachment by the
Spanish forced groups from northern Mexico to flee into south Texas. In the 1700s and 1800s,
there are documented accounts of Spanish entradas passing through the area, but none have been
noted to establish any sort of permanent bases in present-day Atascosa County (Chipman 1992).
It was not until about 1865, that the surrounding frontier hinterlands that are now politically
known as Mc Mullen county were considered safe enough for white settlers to begin establishing
smaller ranches and farmlands without complete annihilation by the many roving bands of angry
Comanche raiders from the north, as well as other displaced Native American groups (Leffler
1996). In sum, there may be rare and isolated occurrences of early ranching activities along the
Dilworth Lateral, but the expectations of encountering any archaeological site of significance
from the 1500s through the mid-1900s along the line were minimal.
Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within each of the two counties, the results simply provide the data that is available.
In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon
the types of cultural resource surveys, and the areas of those surveys. That said, the data that is
available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the areas of south Texas that the surveys
represent. Most of south Texas has never been subjected to formal cultural resource surveys, so
it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is very poorly understood.
Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at least some aspect of what
the region looks like from an archaeological perspective.
A review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the TX-19109 Strickland-Haner Cellular Tower site
had not been subjected to a cultural resources survey, nor were there any recorded archaeological
sites within one mile. The only known professional cultural resources survey within one mile
was along a pipeline for EOG Resources, and reported by archaeologists with Goshawk
Environmental Consultants in 2013 (see Figure 3).

12

As of January 14, 2015 archaeologists had documented 237 archaeological sites within the
modern political boundary of Atascosa County. Evidence of ancient hearths, along with
diagnostic projectile points indicate that 131 of these sites had been used as open campsites from
as early as the Paleoindian period, and through as late as the Late Prehistoric periods (see Figure
3). In addition, 95 of the 225 sites consisted of simply lithic scatters, where pieces of chipped
stone represent the technology used to fashion stone tools through time. Three sites were
emphasized for their abundance of lithic raw material, and where Native Americans exploited
gravel outcrops for making stone tools. Burned rock middens are rare in south Texas, but they
were documented on three archaeological sites in Atascosa County. Of particular note was the
discovery of a single prehistoric human burial found along a county roadway, but where
additional burials have been reported on private property nearby. Finally, historic archaeological
sites that have been documented within the county include: (a) ranches with the remains of
chimneys, cisterns, and corrals, (b) numerous historic artifact trash scatters, (c) a limestone an
earthen dam, (d) a rock church with an adjoining cemetery dating to 1869, (e) a Masonic Lodge
and school in use from 1876-1934, and (f) a cross in a large oak tree on the old San Antonio to
Laredo Road (Atlas 2015).

Soils

As shown in Figure 7, the TX-19109 Strickland-Haner Tower will impact saline Monteola clay,
commonly found on gently sloping uplands in this area of Atascosa County. Monteola clays
formed in thick clay and shaly clay.
A typical soil pedon of Monteola series clay loam from 0-6 inches below the surface consists of
dark gray clay that is very hard, friable, moderately alkaline, and exhibits highly fragmented snail
shells. From 6-21 inches is dark brown clay that is extremely hard with slickensides, and
fragmented snail shell fragments. In this zone it is calcareous and moderately alkaline.
From 21 to 30 inches below the surface one would expect to see dark gray, extremely hard clay
that is calcareous and moderately alkaline. Clay in this zone also exhibits distinct slickensides,
few snail shell fragments, and fine calcium carbonate concretions. From about 30-48 inches
below the surface is grayish brown clay, mottled with dark gray clay. These are extremely hard,
calcareous, and moderately alkaline, with slickensides and soft bodies of calcium carbonates.
Roughly from 48-59 inches below the surface, this zone is pale brown clay with dark gray clay
mottling. It is extremely hard, with intersecting slickensides on ped faces, common soft bodies
of calcium carbonate up to one inch across, and is calcareous and moderately alkaline.
From approximately 59-80 inches below the surface should be pale yellow shaly clay that
exhibits few brownish clay pockets, as well as coarse whitish pockets. It is a rocklike structure

13

parting to fine and medium blocks with few gypsum crystals. This lower zone is also calcareous
and moderately alkaline (Dittmar and Stevens 1980: Websoil Survey Online 2015).

Project Goals and Methods

Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.

14

The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
Prior to the
archaeological
survey, the area
to be impacted
had been clearly
delineated with
survey stakes
(see
for
example, Figure
8 ) .

S u r v e y
Standards, a systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the delineated tract was conducted.
Soils matrices from six shovel tests (see Figure 9) were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh.
In accordance with a designed research plan, all redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests
were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test.
Excavation of the shovel tests were terminated at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs). The
results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms, are on file at Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, and are available upon request.

Survey Project Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations

The proposed TX19109 Strickland-Haner Cell Tower site and access/utility right-of-way was
subjected to a pedestrian survey by two archaeologists on January 14, 2015, and six shovel tests
were excavated. The access/utility right-of-way was covered with a thick layer of bonded caliche
and gravel within a newly constructed entryway for an oil and gas lease road. Otherwise, surface
visibility within the tower footprint area ranged from 80 to 100-percent. Our surface examination
revealed a predominantly mechanically disturbed surface due to blading and land clearing, but
now overgrown with secondary low mesquite brush and trees, and assorted thorny understory.
The results of shovel testing revealed general disturbance in the upper 10-20 cm. Otherwise
shovel testing revealed hard to extremely hard dark grayish brown clay with soft caliche masses
increasing by volume with depth, typical of the Monteola clay series profile.

16

No evidence of cultural material was observed either on the surface or in any of the six shovel
tests excavated. Accordingly, TAAI recommends that construction of the TX19109 StricklandHaner Cell Tower be allowed to proceed as planned, with no further archaeological
investigations. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any undiscovered cultural
resources were encountered during development of the properties, such finds should be examined
and evaluated by an the Texas Historical Commission and Tierras Antiguas, or by any
professional archaeological consultant.
