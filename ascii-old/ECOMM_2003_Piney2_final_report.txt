A cultural resource inventory was conducted on 411 acres at Lake Sam Rayburn in Angelina County, Texas, and
Steinhagen Lake in Jasper County, Texas. Timber harvesting has been proposed within the two parcels. Fieldwork
was conducted from June 5 through June 9, 2003 and consisted of a 100% pedestrian survey accompanied by 370
manually excavated shovel tests. Two archeological sites and one historic cemetery were documented.
Site 41AG28 is a previously recorded prehistoric archeological site at Lake Sam Rayburn. The site has been completely
destroyed by wave erosion and has no potential for further research. It is recommended as not eligible for inclusion on
the NRHP. No further management of the site is warranted.
Site 41AG185 is a historic cemetery at Lake Sam Rayburn, known as the “Bud” Boykin Cemetery or Gilliland-Boykin
Cemetery. The cemetery is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP, but it is actively maintained and will be completely
avoided by the proposed undertaking.
Site 41JP154 at Steinhagen Lake has both prehistoric and historic period components and may have further research
potential. It is unknown whether this site may be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP and it should be avoided and
protected from adverse impacts.

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on two separate tracts of land, totaling 411 acres at Lake Sam
Rayburn in Angelina County, Texas, and Steinhagen Lake in Jasper County, Texas. Work was
conducted at the request of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District
(USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting within the selected parcels and, in
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), an
archeological inventory was undertaken to ensure that any cultural resource sites located on the
parcels would be considered in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork was conducted between June 5 and June 9, 2003. Fieldwork included a
100% pedestrian survey accompanied by intensive and systematic shovel testing. Three hundred
and seventy shovel tests were manually excavated, resulting in a density of 0.9 shovel tests per
acre. Two archeological sites were documented, including one previously recorded site and one
newly discovered site. In addition, one historic cemetery was documented.
Site 41AG28 is a previously recorded prehistoric archeological site at Lake Sam Rayburn. The
site has been completely destroyed by wave erosion and has no potential for further research. It
is recommended as not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
and no further management of the site is warranted.
Site 41AG185 is a historic period cemetery at Lake Sam Rayburn and is known as the “Bud”
Boykin Cemetery or Gilliland-Boykin Cemetery. Historic cemeteries are not normally eligible
for inclusion on the NRHP. The cemetery is managed and maintained by the county and by a
cemetery association. The proposed undertaking will completely avoid this cemetery.
Site 41JP154 is a multi-component archeological site at Steinhagen Lake. It has both prehistoric
and historic period components in good context and may have potential for further archeological
and historic research. On the basis of the limited inventory tactics used here it is unknown
whether or not this site may be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. This site should be avoided
and protected from adverse impacts. If it cannot be avoided, it should be further investigated to
clearly assess its research potential and NRHP eligibility.

Cultural Resource Inventory of Selected Areas at Lake Sam Rayburn and Town Bluff Dam/Steinhagen Lake, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of an inventory of cultural resources conducted on 411 acres at
Lake Sam Rayburn in Angelina County and at Town Bluff Dam/Steinhagen Lake in Jasper
County, Texas. The inventory was conducted on behalf of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE proposes to harvest timber within the
affected area, and in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA), this inventory was undertaken to ensure that any cultural resource sites located on the
parcels would be taken into consideration while planning and conducting the undertaking.
1.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED UNDERTAKING
The USACE is responsible for managing certain federally-owned lands in East Texas in
association with lakes, reservoirs and navigable waterways. These management responsibilities
include 17,461 acres at Lake Sam Rayburn and 7,943 acres at Steinhagen Lake (acreages are
outside conservation pools). Much of this acreage is forested by mature pine and pine-hardwood
stands. In conjunction with the existing management plans for the several reservoirs and in
accordance with accepted silviculture methodologies, the USACE has planned certain
management areas for selective timber thinning. Commercial thinning removes marketable trees
in uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through single tree selection. Removal of crop trees often
disturbs the ground surface but extensive subsurface disturbance is not common.
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account, and in compliance with Section 106 of the
NHPA of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89-665 et seq.), a survey was authorized by the
USACE to identify any archeological sites, buildings, structures, or other resources that may be
eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All inventories were
conducted on lands owned by the Federal Government and managed by the USACE.
1.2 LOCATION
The project area is comprised of two individual parcels, one at Lake Sam Rayburn in Angelina
County and one at Steinhagen Lake in Jasper County (Figure 1-1).
Lake Sam Rayburn
Lake Sam Rayburn is located on the Angelina River approximately 15 miles north of Jasper,
Texas. Authorized by Congress in 1955 for the purposes of flood control, hydroelectric power
generation, and conservation of water for municipalities, industry, agriculture, and recreation,
construction of the reservoir was begun by the USACE in 1956 and impoundment began in 1965.
Initially known as McGee Bend Reservoir, the lake was renamed in honor of Speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives Sam Rayburn (USACE 2002b). The lake is the largest body of water
within the boundaries of the State of Texas. At conservation pool level (164.4 ft above mean sea
level) the lake has approximately 750 miles of shoreline (USACE 2002b). Approximately
17,461 acres of fee lands are managed by the USACE. One tract totaling 235 acres is currently
planned for timber thinning.

The inventory parcel, designated
Cassells-Boykin Park, is located in
Angelina County on the south shore
of Lake Sam Rayburn, about 6 miles
(9.5 km) northeast of the community
of Zavalla, 24 miles (39 km)
southeast of Lufkin (Figure 1-2).
Totaling 235 acres, this parcel
follows the shoreline around a small
peninsula. The parcel is located
northwest of Highway 147 and
measures about 1.6 km (1.0 mile) by
about 1.9 km (1.2 miles) along its
maximum dimensions. It is located
on the Cassells-Boykin Park USGS
7.5’
topographic
quadrangle.
Elevation ranges from lake level to
about 220 ft above sea level.

Figure 1-2 Inventory Area at Lake Sam Rayburn.

Steinhagen Lake
Lake B.A. Steinhagen is situated on the Neches River about 17 km southwest of Jasper in Tyler
and Jasper Counties. Impounded by the Town Bluff Dam, the lake is about 8 miles long and 4
miles wide. Martin Dies Jr. State Park and Sandy Creek Park are on its banks. Construction was
started in March 1947, deliberate impoundment began April 1951, and the dam was completed in
June 1953. The dam is operated by the USACE (USACE 2002c).
The inventory parcel, designated Spring Creek West, is
located in Jasper County on the east side of Town Bluff
Dam and north of Highway 190, immediately northeast
of Martin Dies Jr. State Park (Figure 1-3). The tract is
located on the Pace Hill USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangle. Totaling 176 acres, this tract is irregularly
shaped but maximum dimensions are about 1.9 km (1.2
miles) along an east-west axis by about 1.2 km (0.7
miles) north-south. The parcel is flat and elevation
ranges from 85 to 95 ft above sea level. Several shallow
creeks cross the area in the southwestern portion of the
parcel, nearest the lake, where the terrain is swampy.
1.3 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Figure 1-3 Inventory Area at
Town Bluff Dam/Steinhagen Lake.

The project is located in the Piney Woods region of
deep East Texas. Forested areas in the region included
secondary growth and mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. Pine stands observed during the
field survey were typically comprised of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf (Pinus echinata), and

longleaf (Pinus palustris) pines. Hardwood trees were predominantly various oaks, including
water oak (Quercus nigra), southern red oak (Quercus falcate), and white oak (Quercus alba).
Other representative hardwoods present in the area include American sycamore (Platanus
occidentalis), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and Dahoon holly (Ilex cassine). Within the
Spring Creek Area, low lying swampy areas included water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), bald
cypress (Taxodium spp.), and dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor) vegetation communities.
Wildlife common to the area included whitetail deer, red fox, bobcat, tree squirrels, raccoons and
opossums, armadillo, nutria, otters, and mink. Lake Sam Rayburn is home to a variety of turtles,
frogs and snakes, including the water moccasin (cottonmouth) and the copperhead. The
American alligator is also found here. Bird species include the endangered red-cockaded
woodpecker, as well as bald eagles, osprey, bobwhite and mourning dove, white pelicans,
common loons, herons, and egrets. Fish species include largemouth bass, flathead catfish,
channel catfish, white and black crappie, white bass, and bluegill and other sunfish (USACE
2002b).

2.0 PREVIOUS RESEARCH
The history and prehistory of East Texas have been investigated by many previous historical and
archeological investigations. These include small investigations conducted by the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT), on rural developments by the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), and various projects for utilities and mineral interests. Of these small
projects, the surveys crossing lowland areas have generally recorded higher site densities than
the upland surveys. Larger investigations have been focused on reservoirs (Perttula et al. 1998)
and on the Big Thicket National Preserve (Shafer et al. 1975; Brown et al. 1999). Large
investigations in the region generally show that both prehistoric and historic sites were found
adjacent to the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges. In general,
areas around stream confluences and on small rises within floodplains had a good to excellent
chance of containing prehistoric cultural resources, while historic resources can be in more
diverse conditions, including areas away from water.
2.1 PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES
A map and file search was conducted online of the archives of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) and in person on June 26, 2003; a map and file search was subsequently
conducted at the Texas Historical Commission (THC). No part of the current project area has
been previously intensively inventoried for historic properties. In 1994 a 31-acre shoreline
parcel on the western shore at Cassells-Boykin Park was inventoried by Horizon Environmental
(Nichols 1995). No historic properties were located in this parcel. The boundary for the current
inventory was established with respect to the 1994 inventory to avoid duplication of efforts (see
Appendix B, Figure B-1)
Only one previously recorded archeological site is located within the boundaries of the two
survey parcels. This site, designated 41AG28, is located within the Cassells-Boykin inventory
parcel. However, at least 22 sites are known within a one-mile radius of this parcel. The
majority of these were recorded on behalf of the USACE on lands associated with Sam Rayburn
Reservoir, but some date to 1948, prior to reservoir construction. Few of the sites have
investigations other than shovel testing, and most have sketchy or incomplete site records. None
have been recommended as eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Sites typically appear to be
prehistoric campsites with deposits of lithic debitage and ceramics, located predominantly on
knolls, ridgetops, and (post-reservoir) peninsulas. Ceramics were predominantly sandy paste but
include some bone tempered and grog tempered as well. Lithics typically were flakes of
silicified wood with some jasper. A few fragments of bone have been recorded, but none of the
sites are recorded as containing human burials.
No sites had been previously recorded within the Spring Creek West parcel. Four sites were
previously recorded in the general vicinity, including two on the Spring Creek East parcel
immediately to the east of the current inventory area (see Trierweiler, Bonine, and Galan 2002
for a description of the Spring Creek East parcel). All of the sites appear to contain shallow
deposits of prehistoric sand-tempered ceramics and manufacturing flakes of silicified wood.
None have been recommended as eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.

2.2 CULTURAL HISTORY FRAMEWORK
Humans have lived in East Texas counties for at least 11,000 years. The currently accepted
framework of culture history is outlined by Perttula (1993) in a planning document for East
Texas. This region identifies populations ranging from the Paleo-Indian (prior to 7000 B.C.) to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-100 B.C.) to Late Cultures (A.D. 100-1700) (Story 1990).
These time periods are based on changes in environment, technology, and/or population that
required cultural adaptations to meet varying circumstances.
The Paleo-Indian Period
The earliest known time of human occupation in North America is called the Paleo-Indian
Period. The archeological evidence suggests that during this time the earliest residents of eastern
Texas were highly nomadic hunters and gatherers. Populations were small and dispersed and
exploited a variety of wild food resources (Story 1990; Bryant and Shafer 1977:19-20). The
economy was based on a lithic technology. Large leaf-shaped projectile points, such as the
widespread Folsom and Clovis, are diagnostic of this time period and suggest that mega-fauna
such as extinct bison were key resources.
Paleo-Indian sites are rare and often consist of isolated finds of diagnostic artifacts. Artifacts
recovered in the region suggest that early occupations were principally distributed on tertiary
deposits in the valleys of major stream basins (Perttula 1995). These finds were typically
lanceolate projectile points with ground, concave bases and longitudinal fluting. Toward the end
of the Paleo-Indian Period, point styles gradually changed to more stemmed and barbed varieties.
A small number of archeological sites dating to this earliest time period are known to occur in
the region. As a consequence of this scarcity, these inherently valuable archeological sites are
usually considered to be significant cultural resources.
The Archaic Period
Near the end of the Paleo-Indian Period, global climate began to change slowly, becoming
gradually warmer and drier (Story 1990). In response, plant and animal populations also
changed and the human populations in East Texas began to exploit a wider variety of food
resources. Large game was no longer the primary focus of subsistence. Changes in technology
included a more diverse suite of lithic tools, increased use of grinding stones and the
development of basketry. Pottery is absent. This adaptation is known as the Archaic Period and
has been dated in East Texas as occurring between about 7000 and 100 years B.C. During this
period, hunter-gatherers retained a hunting-gathering subsistence economy but also developed
more regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990).
The Archaic Period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late divisions. Each of these
subdivisions has characteristic types of artifacts, especially projectile points, which suggest
differences in economy and possibly regional affiliations. The Early Archaic is viewed as
transitional from Paleo-Indian to Archaic (Duffield 1963) with technology and population as
driving forces, requiring a greater reliance on the inferior, local East Texas lithic resources and a

Page 6

greater emphasis on territoriality. The Middle Archaic subsistence strategies remained
dependent on a hunting and gathering economy with a greater reliance on native plants
(Thurmond 1990). The Late Archaic period occupations remained dependent on seasonal
variations in food sources and probably moved whenever a food source became scarce or
unavailable. Later Archaic site distributions show a shift from major streams to minor streams
and natural springs (Perttula and Skiles 1986:48-53). This greater number and distribution of
Late Archaic sites in East Texas suggests the successful adaptation to the environment lasting
until the development of pottery (around 500-100 B.C.) and/or until the development of the bow
and arrow.
Archaic Period archeological sites are not quite as rare as are Paleo-Indian sites, but their data
potential can be significant, especially if they are undisturbed. As a consequence, a high
proportion of Archaic Period sites are considered to be significant cultural resources.
Late Cultures
Following the Archaic Period, Late Cultures continued the foraging-gathering subsistence
strategy but also developed new technologies, especially acquiring game with the bow and arrow
and preparing and storing food using ceramic vessels. In the inland southeastern area of Texas,
this population is commonly referred to as the Mossy Grove culture (Story 1990). Although
better identified in the Galveston Bay or Lake Livingston areas, several sites as far north as the
Neches River in Angelina County have characteristics of this culture. The Mossy Grove culture
is generally distinguished by Goose Creek Plain ceramics, a plain sandy paste ware, as described
by Aten (1983). It is thought that most Mossy Grove groups were hunters and gatherers and
practiced little or no agriculture. Most are believed to have practiced a seasonal-round
subsistence pattern with no permanent settlement. Although the Mossy Grove culture continued
until historic times in the Galveston Bay and Lake Livingston areas, it, along with other
Woodland cultures, was replaced by the Caddoan culture in the project vicinity at approximately
A.D. 900 (Story 1990).
The Caddoan culture (A.D. 900-1700) was an indigenous development strongly influenced by
the Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Wyckoff 1971; Story 1990:323).
Caddo subsistence and social organization differ markedly from earlier periods. Horticulture and
then agriculture supplemented hunting and gathering. Larger aggregates of people became
sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas. Cemeteries were found in
association with large ceremonial mounds.
A stratified social structure developed,
corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962; 1975). Extensive
commercial networks were also established. Larger settlements were mainly distributed on
elevated landforms adjacent to major streams, while smaller farmsteads were found along minor
tributaries and spring-fed branches. Hamlets and farmsteads were the most common type of
Caddoan settlement, although larger communities occurred in association with mound centers.
The Caddo tradition lasted until European domination of the area.
Although the Late Cultures flourished in East Texas for only about 15% of the length of human
occupation (i.e., about 1,800 years), sites dating to this period are most common. Of the
thousands of prehistoric archeological sites recorded in this region, nearly 60% date to this

period (Biesaart, Roberson and Spotts 1985:86-90). Although far more common than Archaic
sites, preservation of buried materials is often better, and the data potential of these sites can be
significant, especially if they are undisturbed.
Historic Period
The Historic Period (1700-present) not only describes the history behind the current cultural
setting of the area but also marks a transition from the native populations to the European
immigrants’ establishment of farms, towns, and counties. With the arrival of European settlers,
Historic Indian populations were introduced to immigrants from other tribes and eventual
disposition to Indian Territory outside of Texas. As the indigenous groups were exposed to
Europeans, trade items such as glass beads, metal points, buttons, and gun parts made their way
into the archeological record. Unfortunately, contact with the Europeans also brought new
diseases, which severely reduced the populations of the Caddoan Confederacy villages.
Remnants of these once-numerous people now reside in Oklahoma and Louisiana (USACE
2002b).
The inhabitants of East Texas were first contacted by Europeans between 1528 and 1533 by the
Spanish Explorer, Cabeza de Vaca. This initial foray is believed to have encountered the
Caddoan Adai somewhere between Nacogdoches, Texas and Nachitoches, Louisiana. It was
followed by the explorer Moscoso on his return journey through Texas in 1542 (Long 2002).
His report of crossing the Angelina River mentions several distinct Caddoan groups including
the Ayish, Nondacoa, Nasoni, Nacacahoz, and Naquisca. The Spaniards reported that the local
people actively cultivated fields of maize, which they supplemented with gardens of beans,
squash, and other vegetables, as well as hunting and fishing. Trotlining was a common fishing
technique. Surplus maize was often traded with neighboring people (USACE 2002b). Later on,
French traders were traveling through the area and established connections with the native
inhabitants in the 1690s (McCroskey 2002). This prompted the Spanish to pay more attention to
the region, and in 1691 Domingo Terán de los Ríos cut a path that would eventually become the
Old San Antonio Road. However, settlement of the area by the Spanish did not begin until 1716
and 1717, when Domingo Ramón and Father Antonio Margil de Jesús founded Mission Nuestra
Señora de los Dolores de los Ais near modern San Augustine, Mission Nuestra Señora de la
Purísma Concepción de los Hainai near modern Douglass, Mission San José de los Nazonis near
modern Cushing, and Mission Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de los Nacogdoches in modern
Nacogdoches (Burke 1971; Mason 1974). Presidio Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los Tejas
was also established at the time. Most of the area was abandoned in 1719 due to fighting with
the French, but the Spanish returned in 1720. Soon after two trails linked the area to the rest of
Spanish Texas: the Old San Antonio Road, or Camino Real, connected the San Antonio area to
Nacogdoches, and the Liberty-Nacogdoches Road headed south from Nacogdoches to El
Orcoquisac near the mouth of the Trinity River. Missions Purísma Concepción and San José de
los Nazonis were eventually moved to the San Antonio area in 1730 and 1731, but the other
missions and presidio remained in the area until the cession of the Louisiana territory to Spain in
1763 negated the necessity of their continued presence that far east. The missions and presidio
were abandoned in 1773.

The area around the future Lake Sam Rayburn was re-inhabited by Antonio Gil Ibarvo and his
fellow settlers in 1779, at the location of the previously abandoned mission in the Nacogdoches
area. Areas to the southeast of Nacogdoches along the Angelina River, called the Ayish Bayou
District, were also settled by the Spanish in the late eighteenth century. Shortly after
Nacogdoches’ founding, Ibarvo built a building called the “Old Stone Fort” for business and
administration, and the settlement became a center for illegal trade between Spanish, French, and
Americans (Long 2002; McDonald 1981). Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
Nacogdoches was the central location of politics in East Texas. The town was sacked by Joaquín
de Arredondo around 1812 for housing supporters of Augustus Magee and Bernardo Guitiérrez,
and it became the stage for a battle in 1832 that helped instigate the Texas Revolution, as well as
the center of the Córdova uprising 1838 (McDonald 1980).
San Augustine, the only other densely inhabited area during this time period, also participated
heavily in political activities and conflicts (Crocket 1932). Although the region was constantly
contested in the 1820s and 1830s, Anglo-American settlers continued to come, and set up farms
in what would become Nacogdoches, Angelina, San Augustine, Tyler, and Jasper Counties.
Bevil’s Settlement, later called Jasper, was founded in 1824 by John Bevil and became the
county seat of Jasper County in 1844 (Smith 1979). The first ferry and port town in the area,
Town Bluff, was settled on the Neches River in 1833 as part of the Lorenzo de Zavala’s colony
(Biesele 2002a). Woodville was established in 1846 when Tyler became a county, and quickly
established itself as the county seat (Biesele 2002b).
By 1844, after the Regulator-Moderator War in the east, most of the area had seen the last of
openly violent conflict (McCroskey 2002). However, a new conflict was brewing that eventually
erupted into Civil War. The region was settled mostly by Southerners who carried the slave-run
plantation culture with them, but unlike their neighbors to the north, much of the environment
was not conducive to cotton production, so many who remained in the area were poor farmers
with few or no slaves, relying on subsistence agriculture, corn, and hogs, as well as some
tobacco, rice, and cattle. Steamboats ferried corn, cotton, and other products down the Angelina
and other navigable rivers to markets in the east, and many towns derived their income from port
fees. As a result, the reaction of the region’s inhabitants to secession was mixed. The Mexican
population in Nacogdoches did not approve of secession, but the area eventually voted to support
the cause (Long 2002). Angelina County was one of the few counties in the state to reject
secession altogether (Boon 1937). The other counties to the south and east stuck to their
Southern roots and supported the action, sometimes by an overwhelming margin. Once the Civil
War began however, all the inhabitants of the region supported the Confederate Army, supplying
troops and some iron goods. San Augustine was occupied by Confederate troops to guard
against invasion, but no battles were fought in the area.
Nacogdoches, Woodville, and Jasper were occupied by Union troops during Reconstruction, and
some KKK-like organizations were formed to force African-American activists out of the area,
but these organizations dissolved soon after they were created. The region suffered
economically after the Civil War, and it did not begin to recover until the railroads were built in
the 1880s. All but San Augustine County had railroads built by the end of the nineteenth
century, and this mode of transportation enabled lumbering to be developed in full force. Towns
such as Colmesneil, Rockland, Browndell, Zavalla, and Broaddus started up around new

sawmills, and existing towns began to harvest nearby timber for a new source of income (Biesele
2002c; 2002d; St. Clair and St. Clair 1982; Odintz 2002; Wooster 2002).
At first, lumber was transported along wooden rails to nearby rivers where it would be floated
down to a coastal lumber company (Johnson and Gerland 1996:48). This form of transportation
was called trams or tramways, as they were temporary, narrow-gauge railroads solely used for
the transportation of logs. As the economic value of trams was realized and the value of the pine
forests increased, animal-powered trams were slowly replaced with steam-powered ones, and
railways became longer to link several lumber towns and logging camps together (Johnson and
Gerland 1996:49).
The Houston, East and West Texas Railway was the first railway in the Piney Woods, which
consisted of a narrow-gauge rail from Houston to Shreveport (Maxwell and Baker 1983:35;
Maxwell 1963). Soon, several railroads began servicing the region, including the Gulf,
Beaumont, and Kansas City Railroad built in 1895 from Bronson to Beaumont; the Orange and
Northwestern Railroad from Orange to Buna and Newton; and the Burr’s Ferry, Browndell, and
Chester Railroad (an 11 mile tram rail) from Rockland to Aldridge to the Angelina River. The
Yellow Bluff Tram Company built a railway from Yellow Bluff (on the Neches) to Cairo
Springs and north to Magnolia Springs and Buna (Block 1995:86). The first Yellow Bluff iron
track was laid in 1877 and the steam locomotive arrived the following spring (Johnson and
Gerland 1996:49). With the exception of the Houston, East and West Texas Railway, these first
railroads were built primarily to tap into uninhabited virgin forest and not to transport people or
other goods. However, “trunk lines” were soon built to link major towns and provide rail
transportation to a wider population. By 1900 lumber companies frequently moved their rails
from location to location linking remote logging camps to these more permanent trunk lines
(Johnson and Gerland 1996:56). These trunk lines also provided more convenient access to the
interior, and inland sawmills were built all along the railways, competing with the long
established coastal sawmills. By 1905, Texas was the leader in the nation of railroad mileage,
and more than 1,300 sawmills were in operation in East Texas by 1910 (Johnson and Gerland
1996:48).
Unfortunately, poor timber renewal practices and the Depression caused timber sales to plummet
in the 1930s, and several small towns were deserted. In most areas livestock raising began to
replace what little cotton production was present, and modest oil extraction was developed to
support the economy in Nacogdoches and Jasper Counties. However, the primary economy
remained agricultural, and the people maintained a steady rural lifestyle. Timber harvesting was
revived during and after WWII, but not to the extent of previous years. Other areas began
planting sugar cane, raising poultry, and manufacturing tung (to make lacquer). Lake Sam
Rayburn and Steinhagen Lake were completed in the 1950s and 1960s, and tourism helped to
revive the regional economy.

3.0 FIELD METHODS
The field inventory was conducted from June 5 through June 9, 2003 by four field personnel,
including the Principal Investigator, who was in the field for 100% of the time. Methods and
tactics complied with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements that had been contractually
stipulated by the USACE (2002a:10-44).
3.1 SURVEY TACTICS
For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared showing proposed transect lines at 30 m intervals
on the topographic map. Each field archeologist was given a copy of the topographic map and
was assigned a transect line, and field archeologists marked the locations of shovel tests on these
field maps. In most cases, transect lines were designated with an alphabetical prefix and
individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered. For example, shovel test C-7
was the seventh test along the third transect. In places, each surveyor followed his/her own
transect, but most often two surveyors would “leapfrog” along one transect, each digging
alternating shovel tests. This tactic allowed each transect to be visually inspected twice. GPS
readings were taken at selected shovel tests to verify transect locations.
Where possible, tests were selectively placed on landforms such as ridge lines, knolls, and
promontories. Where shovel tests could not be dug due to standing water, erosion, or steep
slopes, these locations were individually recorded on the shovel testing log.
All tests were dug to the bottom of the Holocene deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cm below
ground surface if no argillic deposits were present. Tests were dug in natural stratigraphic levels
not exceeding 20 cm in thickness and all excavated material was screened through ¼-inch mesh.
Tests were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type, Munsell color, and cultural
material present. Both round and square shovel test were used, depending on the type of shovel
used and the preference of the field archeologist. Round holes were 30 to 35 cm in diameter and
square holes were 30 to 35 cm on a side. The two shapes excavated nearly comparable volumes,
given the inherent margin of error for the tactic. All shovel tests were backfilled.
On each archeological site a permanent site datum was established using an iron rod capped with
an aluminum cap. Caps were stamped with “ECOM 03” and with a temporary site number. Site
boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify zones of
zero or low artifact presence. Based on the distribution of negative shovel tests, site boundaries
were prominently marked with pink-glo flagging tape. Sites were photographed, sketch mapped,
and recorded using State of Texas site forms.
All excavated artifacts were recovered, processed in EComm’s Austin laboratory and will be
returned to the U.S. Government, along with notes and records, upon completion of analysis.
3.2 DENSITY OF SHOVEL TESTING
The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum, one shovel
test was to be excavated per two acres (equivalent to 0.5 tests per acre). Using this rate of

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 11

Cultural Resource Inventory of Selected Areas at Lake Sam Rayburn and Town Bluff Dam/Steinhagen Lake, Texas

coverage, a total of 206 shovel tests was the minimum required to survey the 411 acres (411
acres times 0.5 test per acre). Because a greater testing density had increased chances of
encountering small sites, the spacing of tests along transects was decreased to the extent
allowable under the work plan, resulting in a greater number of total tests. As a result, 370 shovel
tests were placed along transects. Of this number, 20 tests could not be dug due to swampy
conditions or steep slopes, resulting in 350 excavated tests or 144 tests more than the required
minimum. Cassells-Boykin Park received 231 tests of which 227 were successfully excavated.
This calculates to be slightly less than one test per acre. Spring Creek West received 139 tests of
which 123 successfully excavated. This calculates to be one test per 1.4 acres. Net coverage for
the project as a whole averaged 0.9 tests per acre (Table 3-1); this is the equivalent of one test
every 67 by 67 m grid square.

4.0 RESULTS
4.1 LAKE SAM RAYBURN
The Cassells-Boykin Park parcel at Lake Sam Rayburn
Lake totaled 235 acres and was 100% surveyed using
231 shovel tests for a net density of just under one
shovel test per acre. No new sites were discovered,
but one previously known site was found and was rerecorded, and one historic cemetery was documented.
No historic structures were present.

The shovel testing program documented that soils in
the Cassells-Boykin Park area are almost uniformly
shallow. The majority of tests (62%) encountered an
argillic horizon above 20 cm and only 14 of the 231
tests (6%) were deeper than 40 cm. In only three tests
was clay not encountered above 70 cm (see Table 4-1).
Two tests (S3, S5) were not dug because of steep slope and another two tests (E4, F6) could not
be dug due to water saturation of the ground surface. Typical soil profiles on the east side of the
peninsula was 20 to 40 cm of strong brown sandy loam over dark red to reddish-brown clay. On
the eastern side of the peninsula, soil profiles were occasionally deeper, generally showing
strong brown to dark yellowish brown sandy loam over yellowish red to dark yellowish brown
clay. The three deepest tests (AD6, AE7, AF5) were all on the eastern side of the peninsula.
With the exception of some scattered recent debris such as shotgun shells and recent glass
shards, all shovel tests in the Cassells-Boykin Park area were negative.
Site 41AG28
Known as “Chief Popher’s site,” this site is located at the northwestern tip of the CassellsBoykin parcel, on a narrow peninsula of land that extends some 70 m out into Lake Sam
Rayburn. Before lake inundation, this landform was originally a ridge top, but now it is merely a
spit of land 2 to 5 m wide and only 1 to 2 m above water level. A narrow band of exposed and
eroded shoreline surrounds the site (Figure 4-1).
The site was first recorded by Robert L. Stephenson on March 17, 1948 during the Smithsonian
Institution-National Park Service river basin surveys, as is evidenced by a basic sketch map and
some field notes. The site was later re-recorded by Carey Weber on July 12, 1980, and some
updated information was provided in the site file at that time. However, the site is also known in
local legend. As reported by the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel, Chief Popher was a Native
American who was hanged “by a lynch mob for the murder of a white man” (Bowman 2003).
He apparently convinced the mob that he should take the place of his son, who was initially
accused of the murder and would have hung if Chief Popher had not stepped in. He was
believed to have been buried somewhere “along an Angelina County creek which bears his
name” (Bowman 2003). Popher’s Creek is located directly north of Cassells-Boykin Park. It

arises about 6.5 km (4 mi) northwest of the community of Zavalla and flows approximately 14
km (8.7 m) in an easterly direction. It currently empties into Lake Sam Rayburn, but prior to
impoundment the creek emptied into the Angelina River just north of its junction with the
Attoyac River. Site 41AG28 is located approximately 100 to 200 m southeast of the (now
inundated) creek bed.

Page 14

Cultural Resource Inventory of Selected Areas at Lake Sam Rayburn and Town Bluff Dam/Steinhagen Lake, Texas

The association of site 41AG28 with the legend is uncertain. How and when the site became
known as Chief Popher’s site is not recorded in the site file, but the location is consistent with
the legend. Unfortunately, the description of the site on file is vague and the site map, sketched
in 1948, is ambiguous at best. Nonetheless, the location on record placed the site on the narrow
peninsula northwest of the Cassells-Boykin public campground. A USGS benchmark dated
1958 but with no elevation is located on the main shore of the Cassells-Boykin parcel,
immediately east of the narrow spit.
This narrow peninsula has today been
completely destroyed by wave erosion,
and the argillic horizon is exposed over
the entire surface of the spit (Figure 4-2).
As a result, shovel testing of this location
was neither possible nor necessary.
However, a small number of prehistoric
ceramic sherds and lithic flakes were
noted on this eroded surface, occurring as
lag deposits resting on the argillic
horizon.
None of these artifacts is
considered to be in context, but they were
collected as the only remaining site data.
Fifteen sherds were collected, including
three rims and 12 body sherds. Sherds
ranged from 2.0 cm to 6.0 cm in size with
most being about 2.5 cm to 3.0 cm in size.
Thickness ranged from 5 mm to 11 mm,
with a mode at 6 mm. The thickest sherd
is also the only incised sherd. Seven
sherds were decorated; three were
brushed, one was incised, and three had
red slips. Eleven of the sherds (73%)
were grog tempered, three had bone
temper, and one had sand temper. Firing

oxidization and reduction had reduced
cores and oxidized surfaces on 10 sherds,
followed by two completely reduced sherds, and two more with reduced interiors and oxidized
exteriors. One sherd was completely oxidized. Grog temper is typically considered a Caddo
temper starting around 1000 A.D. and suggests that this site is a single component Caddo
occupation.
No lithics were observed on the eroded ground surface, but several small bone fragments were
collected. The largest of these is 3 cm long by about 1.5 cm wide with a thickness of about 4
mm. All fragments appear to be from the same skeletal element, probably a long bone, and all
appear to be from a small mammal or bird. None appear human and none are otherwise
identifiable. In addition, a very small (14 mm by 5 mm) fragment of flat, tabular, cuprous metal

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 15

Cultural Resource Inventory of Selected Areas at Lake Sam Rayburn and Town Bluff Dam/Steinhagen Lake, Texas

was collected from the eroded ground surface. It is not known whether this fragment is related to
the historic Native American site or if it is recent debris.
The diversity of ceramics that remain, coupled with the local legend, suggest that originally the
site may have had significant deposits. However, today the site has no remaining integrity and
has no potential for further research. No further management of this locality is warranted.
Gilliland-Boykin Cemetery (41AG185)
This historic cemetery is located at the end of unpaved County Road (CR) 395, which branches
off from CR 3123 near Cassells-Boykin Park. The cemetery has had several names, including
J.T. “Bud” Boykin Cemetery, Gilliland Cemetery, Cassell-Boykin Cemetery, and the GillilandBoykin Cemetery (Figure 4-3). The cemetery is fenced by a sturdy and new looking, four-foot
chain link fence on all four sides. The fenced area is squarish in shape, measuring 31 m on the
north face, 27 m on the south face, and 26
m each on the east and west faces, and
encloses an area of about 0.2 acres
(Figure 4-4). The area within the fence
appears to have been maintained within
the last 3 to 4 years.
Based on records compiled by a local
genealogical society (Medford and
Wilkins 1982), 27 people are interred
within the fenced boundary (Table 4-2).
At the time of the field inventory only 17
headstones were upright and legible.
Several additional gravestones laid flat on
the ground and/or were weathered to
illegibility.
The headstones were
primarily made of marble, limestone, or
sandstone, with the adults having obeliskshaped stones and the children having
smaller flatter tablets (see Figure 4-3).
The cemetery appears to have been a
family plot, with close relatives interred
together in the same area. The 27 graves
share only seven surnames. These
include: Boykin (8); Gilliland (7); Jones
Figure 4-3 Gilliland-Boykin Cemetery.
(6); Colwell (2); Renfro (2); Dearmond
(1); and Sayers (1). The earliest interment
was in 1869 (Devilla Boykin, aged 2
months) and the last interment was that of J.T “Bud” Boykin, aged 66 years, in 1934. More than
half of the burials date between 1880 and 1910 (Table 4-3). Apparently, the land was owned by
Bud Boykin before it became USACE property (Thompson 2003a).

Figure 4-4 Sketch Map of Site 41AG185, the Gilliland-Boykin Cemetery.

A second cemetery is also named the Boykin Cemetery and is located about 8 miles (12.9 km) to
the southeast off of CR 345. That cemetery is larger, contains a greater number and variety of
surnames, and is more recently used, with interments as recent as the year 2000 (Thompson
2003b).
As the Boykin-Gilliland Cemetery was a small family plot, it was possible to establish some of
the relationships between the interred. Although not all of the familial relationships have been
established through this brief study, one family tree was reconstructed that included 18 of the 27
people interred at this cemetery (Figure 4-5).
Samuel Gilliland was the son of one of the first Anglo families that settled in the region in the
1830s, a move sponsored by the Spanish-Mexican government. His headstone declares him a
“Citizen of the Republic of Texas 1836-1846.” Samuel married Alley Caldwell and moved into

Martha A. Ivy Gilliland was born in 1844 and grew up
to marry Simon W. Boykin (b. 1838). She was the
first postmaster of Popher, a small river community
located 21.5 miles southeast of Homer near the town
of Ora. It is likely that the town was named after
Chief Popher. The exact location of the town is
unknown, as most of it was submerged by Sam
Rayburn Reservoir, but it was likely very nearby as
Pophers Creek was located at the time only 850 m
northwest of the cemetery location (it has since been
widened by the reservoir). Martha was postmaster from 1890 until her death in 1894 (Bowman
1976:178). She and Simon had several children, many of whom did not live through childhood.

One of their children, Devilla, died
at 2 months and was the first to be
interred at the cemetery. Four
more children, one named Sam
and the others with unknown
names, died at an early age and
were buried there. Simon Boykin
died in 1890 and both he and
Martha are buried at the Boykin
Gilliland Cemetery. It is likely
that J.T. “Bud” Boykin was also a
child of Simon and Martha, but he
lived to be 66 before he was buried
with his parents and siblings.
A son of Samuel and Alley
Gilliland, named James L.
Gilliland, was born in 1840 at the
Gilliland homestead about two
miles east of Zavalla. He grew up
to become a farmer and stock
rancher and married Sarah M.

Families.
Porter. In 1887, James served as a
member of the Texas legislature
representing the district then composed of Angelina and Nacogdoches Counties (Bowman
1976:272). He and Sarah had three children to be interred at the Boykin Gilliland Cemetery:
Samuel P. Gilliland, born in 1874 and lived to be 6 years old, J.B. Gilliland, born in 1877 and
lived to be 26 years old, and Mattie D. Gilliland, born in 1887 and only lived 18 months. James
Gilliland died in 1918 and Sarah Gilliland died in 1898. Both were interred at the cemetery.
Samuel and Alley had another child, Mary K. Gilliland, who married Thomas Scott Sayers.
While they were not buried in the Boykin Gilliland Cemetery, their daughter, Allie D. Sayers,
was interred there. It is also likely that Louisa Sayers, who is buried at the cemetery, was an
infant child of Thomas and Mary Sayers who died at 17 months. Allie D. Sayers married John
Renfro, but died at 21 from complications of the birth of their child, Charley Byron Renfro. The
child only lived one month, and both he and his mother were buried at the Gilliland-Boykin
Cemetery.
The relationship between the Gilliland, Boykin, Sayers, and Renfro families and the other people
interred at the Gilliland-Boykin Cemetery is unclear. Only one of the interred persons lived to
be of any significant age, F.M. Jones (72 years), while others only lived to become young adults
or of childbearing age, including Samuel B. Dearmond (26 years), Mrs. Ida Colwell (22 years),
Allie M. Jones (18 years), and Wiley M. Jones (16 years). The remaining people died in early
childhood, including Winnie Colwell (5 years), Leon Jones (13 months), and Annie Jones (1 day).
Ann C. Jones died at an undetermined age, but was likely an infant based on the size and shape
of the headstone.

The mortality schedule at the Gilliland-Boykin Cemetery reflects the hardships of a frontier area
in the mid to late nineteenth century. Age at death is strongly bimodal. Nearly half of the
burials are those of children under age 10 and a

Cemeteries are normally excluded from consideration
for inclusion on the NRHP. However, the cemetery is
actively managed and maintained by San Augustine
County and by a cemetery association, and its care
and upkeep are ongoing. Accordingly, the proposed
timber thinning undertaking will avoid this cemetery
as a best management practice. The cemetery is well
marked and is surrounded by a modern chain link
fence in good repair, and total avoidance is feasible.

4.2 TOWN BLUFF DAM/LAKE STEINHAGEN
The Spring Creek West parcel at Town Bluff
Dam/Steinhagen Lake totaled 176 acres and was
100% surveyed using 139 shovel tests for a net
density of 0.8 tests per acre. One previously
unknown site was found and recorded. No historic
structures were present.

Soils profiles in the Spring Creek West area were
somewhat deeper than in the Cassells-Boykin Park
area, with more than half (52%) deeper than 30 cm
(Table 4-5). However, only 13 of the tests (9%)
encountered clay below 50 cm and only a single test
was dug deeper than 80 cm without encountering
clay. Sixteen tests could not be dug because of
swampy conditions; these were generally in the
southern and eastern portions of the parcel, nearest
Spring Creek. The typical soil profile was 30-50 cm of brown to yellowish brown sandy loam
over red or sometimes yellowish-brown clay.
Site 41JP154
This previously unknown site consists of historic features on top of shallowly buried prehistoric
lithics and ceramics. It is located on the first terrace of the Kelly Branch flood plain, a tributary
to the Neches River at an elevation of 88 ft amsl. The aluminum site marker was labeled with
field number “ECOMM 03-08.” As indicated by positive shovel tests, the site measures about
80 m by 40 m and has an area of about 0.75 acre (Figure 4-6). Nineteen shovel tests were used

Page 20

to define this site; ten of these were positive and contained artifacts to 50 cm below the current
ground surface. With the exception of ST 1 which was placed in a feature context (see below) all
shovel tests encountered clay at depths ranging from 28 cm (ST 12) to 52 cm (ST 16) below the
surface. Of the 18 non-feature tests, the average depth of the clay horizon was 40.2 cm; eleven
tests (61%) were shallower and seven tests (39%) were deeper than this mean.
Feature 1 is a circular mound measuring approximately 7 m in diameter and 1.5 m high (Figure
4-7). The top of the feature shows a slight depression. The soil of the mound is extremely dark,
almost black, and abundant small chunks of charcoal are visible in the matrix. A shovel test (ST
1) placed on top of the mound encountered a black, extremely loose matrix containing mostly
charcoal and little sand and was easily excavated to 90 cm. No artifacts were present. One 60
cm wide profile was exposed on the eastern portion of the mound. Seven shovel tests were
placed in a radial pattern 5 to 10 m in diameter away from the mound. The nearest three of these
recovered subsurface prehistoric material from 20 to 40 cm below the surface.
Feature 1 is clearly a historic locus of intensive wood burning, coincidentally overlying a buried
prehistoric component. Several interpretations of the historic feature are possible. Features of
this size, shape and description have been shown to be turpentine (pine-tar) manufacturing kilns
(Ippolito 2003). However, such kilns must have a shallow trench around the perimeter in order to

collect the pine-tar residue from the heated logs. No such trench or peripheral surface depression
was observed in association with this feature, and this interpretation is considered unlikely. A
second possibility is that the feature was a charcoal manufacturing station. Charcoal was a fuel
source for the historic logging tram engines used historically in east Texas. However, the high
relief and relative integrity of the feature suggests that the abundant charcoal may not have been
completely removed from the feature after burning. A third possibility is that the feature may
simply be a burn-pile for slash and that the charcoal was an unwanted byproduct (Ippolito 2003).
The shovel test excavated in Feature 1 did not encounter any pieces of charcoal larger than 2 cm
(0.8 inch), thus supporting the speculation that the feature did not contain large logs suitable for
the manufacture of recoverable charcoal. Whether the feature was in fact a charcoal kiln or
merely a slash pile could be further examined by obtaining charcoal samples and determining
whether hardwood or softwood was used (Ippolito 2003). Here, the null hypothesis assumes that
the feature was a kiln for the manufacture of charcoal.
Charcoal is carbonized wood that contains less than 5% moisture and is easy to ignite. It burns
more cleanly and evenly, and is 7.5 times more efficient than raw wood. It is also easier to carry
than wood, and that is one reason why charcoal is usually made for transport and sale, rather than
local use (Wood et al. 1980). Generally, small-scale production of charcoal was made in
earthmound kilns, like the one at 41JP154, but large-scale production in stationary kilns is also
common in industrial areas from the turn of the century to the present day (Emrich 1985).
Earthmound kilns typically range from 2 to 15 m in diameter and 1.5 to 11 m high (Figure 4-8).
Several air inlets are installed at the base to draw off the moisture and gas, and the first logs are
laid in a cross-cut pattern to let air in from the bottom. The remaining logs are stacked on top.
Gaps between the logs are filled in with smaller logs, and a layer of leaves or straw is laid on top
of the mound. Sandy or loamy soil is packed in around the entire mound about 20 to 25 cm
thick. Once ignited, an operator must tend the mound, opening and closing vents as necessary, to
achieve the desired result. The burning and cooling time may take several days to complete
(Emrich 1985:27-33).
It is not certain whether Feature 1 was a charcoal kiln or a slash burn pile. The soil profile
exposed on the eastern margin of the mound suggests several episodes of construction and reuse
(Figure 4-9). If the feature is a kiln, the final attempt at charcoal manufacturing may not have

achieved the desired result, suggested by the fact that the mound was not dug out and the
charcoal retrieved. Only small chunks of charcoal were visible in the mound; it is possible that
too much air was let into the kiln during firing and reduced the wood to small pieces of charcoal
and ash.
About 50 m to the northwest of Feature 1 is a second mound, designated Feature 2. This mound
is more subtle in appearance. It is larger and irregularly shaped, measuring 7 m by 13 m, and is
much lower in profile, measuring perhaps 20 cm high. A shovel test placed on this mound (ST
11) was positive, recovering flakes, sherds, and a projectile point between 20 cm and 40 cm
below the surface. Four additional shovel tests in the area of Feature 2 also recovered subsurface
prehistoric artifacts. A line of four shovel tests placed between Feature 2 and Feature 1
recovered additional subsurface material from two of the tests, tentatively connecting the two

loci. The shovel test directly on top of the Feature 2 mound (ST 11) recorded a strong brown
(7.5YR 4/6) clay loam to 50 cm below the surface, at which depth a yellow-red clay was
encountered. This profile is identical to those observed in the two tests immediately to the north
(ST 9, 14) which were dug to 50 cm and 40 cm respectively. The tests to the southeast (ST 10,
13, 15) are 10 to 17 cm shallower than this and show a brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam over a red
(2.5YR 5/8) clay. Feature 2 is considered to be the focus of the prehistoric component. The lack
of a distinct profile on the mound suggests that it may be a natural topographic rise that was
prehistorically selected as a temporary campsite.
Immediately southwest of Feature 2 was a narrow and linear
clearing. This area was between 4 m and 7 m wide and
appeared to continue in a straight line indefinitely to the
northwest and southeast. The ground surface was artificially
flattened and appeared to be a trail or road bed. A shovel
test placed adjacent to this alignment (ST 17) recovered an
iron railroad spike in the upper 20 cm. The spike was 1 cm
by 1 cm square in cross-section and measured approximately
14 cm (5.5 inches) in length (Figure 4-10). In the vicinity of
this test and at other locations along the linear alignment
were lengths of woven iron cable. Feature 3 is interpreted as
a historic temporary tram bed. Such trams are known to
have been constructed to service the local timber industry
and were not part of a permanent railroad system (Block
1995; Maxwell 1963; Maxwell and Baker 1983; Johnson
and Gerland 1996).
Three narrow-gauge railroad lines have been known to pass
through this area, including the Texas and New Orleans
Railroad (to be incorporated into Southern Pacific) running
north-south from Warren, Hillister, Woodville, Doucette,
Colmesneil, Rockland, and Sulphur Springs; the Gulf,
Beaumont and Kansas City Railroad (later to become the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, which was merged
with the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad) running
north-south from Roganville, Jasper, and Browndell; and
finally the Burr’s Ferry, Browndell and Chester Railway that
Figure 4-10 Railroad Spike.
ran east-west from Rockland to the lumber camps of
Aldridge and Turpentine. This tram bed does not match the
known locations of previous lumbering railroads, which are at least 12 miles from the project
location. It is more likely that this rail bed was a temporary tram that ran from a remote
lumbering camp to the Neches River, only 2 to 3 miles away, where the logs were then floated
downriver to a lumber mill.
Based on proximity, the charcoal manufacturing mound (Feature 1) and the railroad bed (Feature
3) are most probably functionally related.

A total of eight ceramic sherds were recovered from the site, including five body sherds and
three rim sherds. Ceramic tempering materials were diverse and included three grog tempered
sherds, three sand tempered and two with both grog and sand. All eight sherds had smoothed
surfaces, and two were decorated with brushing on the exterior. Both of the brushed sherds were
grog tempered. Size ranged from 2 to 5 cm and thickness ranged from 4 to 6 mm. Firing
correlated with temper. The three sand tempered sherds were all oxidized on the exterior and
reduced on the interior, while the three grog tempered sherds had oxidized cores and reduced
interior and exterior surfaces.
The projectile point recovered from Feature 2 (Figure 4-11) has a broken
tip, but measured 2.4 cm long by 2.0 cm across the shoulders by 4 mm
thick. It has wide, barbed shoulders with a parallel stem. Although
broken, it has a hint of recurved lateral edges and resembles an Alba point
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:264; Turner and Hester 1993:200). Alba Points are
accepted as dating to the Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800-1200). The 19 lithic
flakes recovered from the site are mostly very small tertiary (thinning)
flakes of silicified wood or jasper. The largest flake measures only 3.6 cm
long by 1.8 cm wide. Two small broken pebbles are also present.

Figure 4-11
Alba Point.

On the basis of the recovered ceramics and the Alba point, the prehistoric component of site
41JP154 may be interpreted as a multi-component site with separate Early Ceramic and Caddo
occupations Alternatively, based on its geographic location, the site may represent a single
occupation that shares traits of both cultures. Sand tempered ceramics have a wide distribution
but are considered part of an earlier tradition that expanded into Angelina County from the Gulf
Coast Goose Creek tradition beginning around 200 B.C. Grog temper is typically considered a
Caddo temper starting around 1000 A.D. Based on the tightly restricted vertical distribution of
artifacts coupled with the natural mound landform, the prehistoric component may possibly
retain good spatial integrity. In addition, the presence of both ceramics as well as lithics suggests
that there may be a broader diversity of artifacts present. However, the limited data returns
provided by the shovel testing tactics do not allow at this time a clear assessment of site research
value. As a result, it is unknown whether or not the prehistoric component of the site may or
may not be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Further investigation is warranted to resolve this
issue.
The historic component of site 41JP154 also merits further investigation. Although abandoned
railroad beds related to the timbering industry are common throughout the region, the association
of this feature with the less common charcoal manufacturing mound presents the potential of a
more integrated picture of the early timbering industry. Further research into this historic
context as well as further field investigation should be conducted to fully assess the NRHP
eligibility of the historic component.
Until such time as the NRHP eligibility of the site can be clearly ascertained, it should be
avoided and protected from adverse impacts.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS
5.1 SUMMARY OF RESULTS
This cultural resources inventory inspected two separate parcels in East Texas. The CassellsBoykin Park parcel at Lake Sam Rayburn in Angelina County contained 235 acres and the
Spring Creek West parcel at Town Bluff/Steinhagen Lake in Jasper County contained 176 acres.
The total area surveyed consisted of 411 acres.
Field methods included pedestrian survey accompanied by excavation of 370 shovel tests.
Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon or to
80 cm below the surface. Density of shovel tests was contractually a minimum of 0.5 tests per
acre, but empirically achieved 1.0 shovel tests per acre at Cassells-Boykin Park and 0.8 tests per
acre at Spring Creek West. Overall testing density for the project as a whole was 0.9 tests per
acre; this is approximately equivalent to one test every 67 by 67 m grid square.
Excluding recent debris such as shotgun shells and glass shards from broken beer bottles,
cultural material was found in only 11 of the 370 shovel tests (3%). This included historic
material in one test and prehistoric artifacts in ten tests.
The survey documented two archeological sites and one historic cemetery. No historic buildings
or structures were present. One of the archeological sites was previously documented and the
second was a newly discovered site.
5.2 RECOMMENDATIONS
The eligibility of any given archeological site for inclusion on the NRHP is determined by
evaluating the site’s significance. This is determined by assessing its potential to contribute
meaningfully to future scientific research. Research potential is measured by comparing the
types of data that are known - or are suspected - to exist at the site, together with their context
and integrity, against a set of research questions that have been previously recognized for similar
sites in the region.
Chief Popher’s Site (41AG28) has been completely destroyed by wave erosion and has no
potential for further research. The site is recommended as not eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP. No further management is warranted for this site.
The Gilliland-Boykin Cemetery (41AG185) is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. It is
actively managed and maintained by the county and by a cemetery association. The proposed
timbering undertaking will be designed and conducted to completely avoid this cemetery.
Site 41JP154 has buried prehistoric artifacts in good context and also has historic features related
to the early timbering industry of East Texas. The site may have potential for further research but
not enough is known about the site at this time to permit a thorough evaluation of NRHP
eligibility. As a result, the site should be treated as if it were eligible and should be avoided and
protected from adverse impacts. If it cannot be avoided or protected, then it should be further
investigated to clearly determine NRHP eligibility.

PREHISTORIC CERAMIC ANALYSIS
Victor Galan
Introduction
The ceramic analysis focused on describing sherd attributes, vessel manufacture, and decorative
techniques. The data collected from the sherds along with comments about unique
characteristics are presented in Table A-1. As the sample size is small and being collected from
shovel tests, the interpretation is broad. A total of 23 sherds were examined and described from
two sites. The analysis of sherds from 41AG28 included 15 specimens while 41JP154 included
eight specimens. Sherds smaller than 20 mm in size were not analyzed. In general, the ceramic
description and analysis found the decorations and sherd thickness suggest utilitarian use.
Temper suggests 41AG28 may be a single component Caddo occupation while 41JP154 may be
a multi-component site with Early Ceramic and Caddo occupations.
Definitions
Sherd attributes included collection data on vessel part, sherd size, and sherd thickness. Vessel
parts are described as base, rim, and body. Base sherds were identified by a flat and generally
thicker cross section from the underside of the vessel. Rim sherds included the lip of the vessel.
No rims were large enough to make an estimate of vessel size. Body sherds comprised the
surface of the vessel between the rim and base sherds. Sherd size was determined by placing the
sherd in the center of a scale of concentric rings with a 5 mm separation. Size was determined as
the ring closest to the edge of the sherd. Thickness was measured with calipers as the maximum
perpendicular distance between the interior and exterior surfaces of the sherd by pinching the
thickest portion of the sherd between parallel edges of the calipers.
Vessel manufacture included examining temper and firing techniques. For this analysis, temper
was bone, grog, sand, or grog/sand. Temper was observed using a reflective light microscope set
at 25x magnification. Bone temper was identified by several white angular inclusions in the
vessel paste. Grog was identified by several fine angular inclusions of fired clay. Sand temper
was identified by an abundance of quartz grains. When described alone, sand temper sherds
show the cross section of the sherd with a sandpaper texture. The sandpaper texture often
continued on the interior and exterior surfaces of the sherd. Combined with grog temper, the
amount of quartz sand particles is less but still far greater than the typical grog sherd. Firing was
described using Teltser’s (1994:530-543) article of oxidization patterns in sherd cross-sections.
Decoration techniques included decoration type, location, and surface treatment. Decoration
type included brushed, red slip, and plain categories for this analysis. No decorative elements
were distinctive enough to relate to a specific type. Without decorative elements only
descriptive and manufacture data can be obtained from plain sherds. As stated in Suhm and
Jelks (1962:19), several varieties of vessels were only decorated around the rim leaving a large
portion of the vessel undecorated. Decoration location was on the exterior of the sherd (convex
side), the interior of the sherd (concave side), or both sites. Surface treatments were described as
smooth or burnished with smoothed surfaces being created while the vessel was wet or leather

Sample Descriptions
Site 41JP154. A total of eight ceramic sherds were analyzed (Table A-1). Of the total, 63%
(n=5) were described as body sherds and 37% (n=3) were rim sherds. Only two of the sherds
were decorated with brushing on the exterior. Both of the brushed sherds were grog tempered.
The remaining six plain sherds included three sand tempered, two grog/sand tempered, and one
grog tempered. All eight sherds had smoothed surfaces. Size ranged from 20 to 50 mm with the
mode size of 20 mm (n=4). Sherd thickness ranged from 4 to 6 mm with the mode thickness of 5
mm (n=5). Firing oxidization and reduction was split with three sherds oxidized on the exterior
and reduced on the interior and three sherds with a thin layer of oxidization on both surfaces but
a reduced core. The remaining two sherds include one with a thin layer of reduction on both
surfaces and a oxidized core and one sherd with a reduced exterior and core but an oxidized

interior. Therefore, the firing environment for half of the sherds was mostly reduced and the
other half was partially oxidized. Firing does correlate with temper in this sample. The three
sand tempered sherds were all oxidized on the exterior and reduced on the interior while the
three grog tempered sherds had oxidized cores and reduced interior and exterior surfaces.
Site 41AG28.
The site 41AG28 ceramic sherd sample included 15 specimens (Table A-1).
Only 20% (n=3) of the sherds are rim fragments; the remaining 80% (n=12) are body sherds.
Decorative elements were found on 47% (n=7) which included three brushed, one incised, and
three with red slip. Brushing and incising was on the exterior surfaces only. Red slip was badly
eroded off of all three specimens; it was found on the interior of one sherd and on both interior
and exterior surfaces on the remaining two sherds. Surface treatment was smoothed on all but
two sherds with burnishing. The two burnished sherds were also decorated with red slip.
Temper included three bone, one sand, and 11 grog. Sherd size ranged from 20 to 60 mm with
the most common size between 25 mm (n=4) and 30 mm (n=5) with only one smaller (20 mm)
and the remaining five sherds between 40 mm and 60 mm in size. Thickness follows a similar
trend with a range from 5 mm to 11 mm. The mode thickness is 6 mm at five sherds followed
closely by sherds 5 mm and 8 mm with four specimens each. The thickest sherd is also the only
incised sherd. Firing oxidization and reduction had reduced cores and oxidized surfaces 67%
(n=10) followed by completely reduced sherds (n=2) and reduced interior with oxidized exteriors
(n=2). The last sherd was completely oxidized.
Results
The analysis of the ceramic collections from 41AG28 and 41JP154 found evidence of general
site use and gross time range. On both sites, the decorated sherds are predominantly brushed
with instances of red slip and incising on 41AG28. Brushed wares are typically utilitarian while
red slipped wares are considered special purpose vessels and Caddoan in origin. The one incised
sherd is from a thicker vessel and most likely represents a utilitarian purpose. Sherd temper from
this sample indicates 41AG28 may be a single component Caddo occupation while 41JP154 may
be a multi-component site with Early Ceramic and Caddo occupations or, based on the location,
may be used by a population near the temporal and spatial boundary of both cultures. Sand
tempered ceramics have a wide distribution but are considered part of an earlier tradition that
expanded into Angelina County from the Gulf Coast Goose Creek tradition around 200 B.C.
Grog temper is typically considered a Caddo temper starting around 1000 A.D. The exploration
of the geographical and time boundary expressed on 41JP154 by the sand tempered and grog
tempered ceramics should be considered in the recommendations for further study of the site.
