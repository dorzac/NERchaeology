ABSTRACT
An intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed Byron
Nelson High School development tract which consists of approximately
80 acres was conducted by AR Consultants, Inc. during early June of
2007. The survey was conducted for Corgan Associates, Inc. which is
doing the environmental permitting for the Northwest Independent School
District (NWISD). Since the NWISD is a political entity of Texas, Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 4552 was issued by the Archeology Division
of the Texas Historical Commission for the survey. The study area is
located north of Marshall Creek Road and east of Lakeview Lane in
Trophy Club in Denton County, Texas.
A records research did not reveal any historic or prehistoric cultural
resources in the study area and none were found during the survey or
uncovered in 27 shovel tests. Based on the field investigation, it is AR
Consultant’s recommendation that no further cultural resource
investigations are warranted on this property. The Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission should be advised if buried cultural
resources are uncovered during construction, and, if found, construction
should cease immediately in that area until discussions with the Texas
Historical Commission have been concluded.

INTRODUCTION
Northwest Independent School District intends to construct a new high school (Byron
Nelson High School) in Trophy Club, Texas. The proposed development tract consists of
approximately 80 acres and is located west of and adjacent to Lakeview Road and north
of and adjacent to Marshall Creek Road in Denton County, Texas (Figure 1). After a
project review, the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission requested
an archaeological survey of the approximately 80 acre tract in a letter dated May 22,
2007. As a result, an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed
development tract was conducted by AR Consultants, Inc. during the early part of June
2007. The archaeological survey was conducted to determine if cultural materials were
present, to make recommendations about their significance and determine how they
would be impacted by construction. The survey was done for Gorgan Associates, Inc.
which is doing the environmental permitting for the Northwest Independent School
District.
Since the proposed development tract overlooks and is adjacent to Denton Creek,
relevant federal legislation may include Section 404 Permit for the Clean Water Act that
is administered by the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Other
relevant legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended
(PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291),
Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment”
and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800),
Appendix C. In addition, the Texas Antiquities Code is applicable since the Northwest
Independent School District is a political entity of the State of Texas and Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 5442 was issued by the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission for the survey.
The following report contains a brief description of the natural environment, the culture
history and then a review of previous investigations in the area. This is followed by the
research design and methodology. The description of the archaeologically surveyed
corridor constitutes the major part of this report. Recommendations are contained in the
final chapter. A list of references cited concludes the report. This report was written in
accordance with the guidelines for short reports adopted by the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists
(N.D.).

NATURAL SETTING
Denton County is located in North Central Texas. It is bisected by the sandy soil of the
Eastern Cross Timbers. The western portion of the county is covered by the black soil of
the Fort Worth Prairie, in which the study area lies, and the eastern part consists of the
rich, black soil of the Blackland Prairie. The county is drained by the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River and several major creeks (Odom 2003).
The underlying geology of the study area is mapped as the Upper Cretaceous-aged Eagle
Ford Formation which consists of shale which is overlain by Quaternary fluvatile terrace
deposits (Bureau of Economic Geology 1967). The soil association in which the study
area lies is the Ponder-Lindale which consists of nearly level to gently sloping upland
loams (Ford and Pauls 1980:Sheet 34). Specific soils within the study area consist of
undulating Aledo association, hilly Arents, Branyon clay with 0 to 1 percent slopes,
Mingo clay loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes, Sanger clay with 1 to 3 and 3 to 5 percent
slopes and Somervell gravelly loam with 1 to 5 percent slopes (Ford and Pauls
1980:Sheet 45).
The upland surface has been cleared of most trees and supports Bermuda and other
grasses that have been invaded by mesquites. The edge of the upland and the valley
support numerous young and old trees including bois d’arc, American elm, cedar elm,
hackberry, honey locust along with various weeds and masses of greenbriars. According
to various authors, including Lynott (1979), the prairie once supported a cover of tall
grasses and was inhabited by now absent herbivores including bison and antelope.
Certainly, deer inhabited the floodplain forests, but this environment is not present in the
survey area.
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring and Yates
(1997), Humphrey and Ferring (1994), and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations
based on different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on
Ferring’s investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating
periods of rapid alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier
conditions, Ferring has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr B.P. to the present]
was a wet period with moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000 to 1000
yr B.P. [A.D. 1 to 1000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol was
established on the stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and its
tributaries. This interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope
analysis. Brown (1998) offers a differing interpretation based on isotopic analyses of
mussel shells from a prehistoric site (41DL270) on Denton Creek. He concludes that the
period from 1500 to 2500 yr B.P. was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after the
environment was warmer and drier, but he points out that this interpretation may only be
applicable for the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

CULTURE HISTORY
The history and prehistory of Denton County are summarized in several reports prepared
by the University of North Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990; Ferring and Yates 1998).
Prehistoric Native American settlement in Denton County began at least 10,000 years ago
as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points (Crook and Harris 1957)
at the Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001). Moreover, artifact
collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff and other Paleo-Indian
points from the surface of sites in the region. The presence of exotic, i.e., non-local, lithic
resources indicates that these early people traveled through a territory where higher
quality lithics were available or the people were involved in a system of raw material
trading. These early people hunted now-extinct large game, but probably also foraged off
the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000 to 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700-800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the counties but particularly along
the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods.
Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts found
on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making and using exotic cherts
for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics for
chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and
Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or
ridges that overlook the Elm Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have been
recorded in upland areas throughout the county. These sites appear to be Archaic in age,
but none have been thoroughly studied.
About A.D. 700 to 800, a major change is found in the artifacts and settlement patterning
of the prehistoric sites. This is attributed to the drying up of the smaller tributaries.
During this period, which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East
Texas appears as trade material along with the indigenous Nocona Plain pottery. It has
been suggested that farming may have been practiced. Arrowheads appear about this
same time and apparently the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tool kit.
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the north-central Texas area based on an absence of sites with trade
goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish or English traders (Skinner
1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and attempts to
factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational archaeologists
who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region (Peter, Cliff and Green
1996:2). There is very little evidence of historic era Native American occupation
anywhere in the region although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the
early 1800's.
The history of human’s presence in North Central Texas continues with the first written
accounts by the French and Spanish explorers. There is tantalizing evidence to the south
in Dallas County of possible visits by Spanish explorers. Current research, however,

seems to indicate that Anglo settlers were the first non-Indians to visit the survey area.
Established European settlement in Denton County began before the mid-1800's with the
establishment of the Peter's Colony after Texas independence. These early settlers were
farmers who selected bottomland along the Elm Fork of the Trinity. The town of Little
Elm was established with a post office in 1845 (Bridges 1978). Commercial farming was
not important until after the Civil War, and the early settlers were essentially selfsufficient. Besides the plants and animals they grew, wild animals and plants were
commonly consumed. Denton became the county seat in 1856. By 1875, cotton, corn, and
wheat were the main cash crops. Up to half of these crops were grown by tenant farmers
who either paid rent to the land owner for their house, tools, and seed or by tenants who
gave the landowner a third of the grain and a quarter of the cotton or other cash crops. By
the turn of the century, all of the major communities had been established and some had
passed away.
Previous Investigations
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007) no sites have been recorded in
the study area. Historic maps, including the 1918 Soil Map of Denton County (Carter and
Beck 1918) and the R. King Harris’ map (1936) were also reviewed. No historic
farmsteads were shown on the maps.
AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2002) conducted an intensive pedestrian survey
of approximately 13.5 acres slightly southwest and about 900 m west of the study area.
No cultural materials older than 50 years were found on the ground surface or in 20
shovel tests.
Denton Creek’s floodplain was investigated by AR Consultants, Inc. northwest of the
study area along US 377. A base of dart point was the only significant artifact found
during the survey and in 28 shovel tests which were supplemented with augering to an
average depth of approximately 80 cm. The floodplain was again surveyed (Todd 2005a)
further northwest and no cultural materials were seen on the ground surface or uncovered
in 17 shovel tests which were excavated to an average of about 110 cm below the ground
surface.
AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2005b) investigated 8 existing well pad sites along Denton
Creek and near Trophy Club. One of the well pad sites is located adjacent to the study
area. No cultural materials were found.
A pipeline route was investigated along Marshall Branch and adjacent to Trophy Country
Club golf course in Trophy Club. No cultural materials older than 50 years were found on
the ground surface or in 6 shovel tests which excavated to an average depth of
approximately 100 cm below the ground surface.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

Research Design
The purpose of the research design below is to insure that fieldwork will contribute to
better understanding of prehistoric and historic settlement in Denton County. The first
hypothesis is that prehistoric sites possibly are present because the development tract is
on a ridge overlooking Denton Creek which is a source of perennial water.
The second hypothesis is that historic sites also might be present because the
development tract is adjacent to a roadway.
Methodology
In order to address these questions, the field personnel, with the aid of appropriate project
system design maps, USGS maps and soil information for Denton County, conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the study area. Due to the odd-shape of the
study area, it was surveyed in various manners, but the most common was north-south
oriented transects spaced approximately 30 m apart. Notes on the vegetation, soil and
other relevant information were taken as were photographs.
The ground surface was carefully inspected especially in areas where visibility was less
than thirty percent. Shovel tests were excavated on a judgmental basis as recommended
by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) in the Fort Worth Prairie upland setting.
However, shovel tests were excavated approximately 100 m apart along the ridge
overlooking the creek. Shovel tests were excavated to approximately 35 cm below the
ground surface in the degrading environment. Shovel tests were not dug in mechanically
disturbed areas or where the ground visibility was greater than thirty percent. The clay
which could not be screened was manually inspected for cultural resources as well as the
pit walls.
Backhoe trenching was not done due to the upland setting where any cultural materials
would deflate onto the ground surface after erosion.

RESULTS
This chapter is broken into various portions. The first portion is a description of the
survey area which is followed by a discussion of the survey. Conclusions end the chapter.
Shovel tests are described generally in the text but specific information is provided in
Table 1 at the end of the chapter. Shovel test locations are shown on Figure 4.
The survey area
The survey area consists of gently sloping to nearly level terrain until the edge of the
ridge that overlooks Denton Creek is reached. Here the slope is quite steep. Understory
vegetation includes grape vine, johnson grass, grama grasses, thistle, Indian paint brush,
daisies, wild squash, hog brush and prickly pear. American elm, winged elm and
hackberry trees are present but mesquite is the dominant tree in the study area. Typical
vegetation is shown in Figure 2. Ground visibility ranged from less than 10 to 100
percent. Eye-height visibility ranged from 20 to 60 meters.
Abundant limestone and dirt two-track roads (Figure 3) were present throughout the
study area allowing for excellent ground visibility. Limestone roads were more abundant
in the eastern portion of the study area than the western part. A channel that is
approximately 20 m wide and 3 m deep is present along the eastern boundary and shown
in Figure 4. The photograph illustrates how close the limestone bedrock is to the ground
surface.

The Survey
Survey began in the southeast corner and went north and paralleled the eastern, northern
and western boundaries. No shovel tests were excavated for the first approximately 450
m due to the ground visibility being greater than 60 percent and limestone bedrock
outcropping onto the surface.
Shovel tests 1 through 7 were placed along the southwestern ridge edge. Shovel tests
(hereafter ST) 1 and 3 uncovered 37 and 40 cm of clay, respectively while ST 2
encountered 35 cm of sandy loam. Shovel test 4 uncovered 10 cm of sandy loam
overlying sandy clay subsoil that extended to 35 cm below the ground surface. Limestone
bedrock was encountered at 15 and 23 cm below the ground surface in STs 5 and 7,
respectively, and were overlain by clay. Thirty-five cm of clayey sand was uncovered in
ST 6. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface despite
the good ground visibility or uncovered in 7 shovel tests.
Shovel tests 8 and 9 were placed along the northeastern ridge line. Fifteen cm of sandy
loam overlaid limestone bedrock in ST 8 and 38 cm of clay was encountered in ST 9. No
shovel tests were excavated for approximately 120 m northeast of ST 9 due to the
excellent ground visibility because of the two-track roads along the edge as shown in
Figure 3. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface and
the shovel tests were culturally sterile.
The archaeologists then crossed a small intermittent tributary and investigated the finger
that forms the northern portion of the study area. Shovel tests 10 through 15 were
excavated in this portion of the study area. No shovel tests were excavated within the
northeast portion of the northern portion because it had been mined in the past. Shovel
test 10 uncovered 35 cm of sandy loam while ST 11 encountered 37 cm of clay. Eighteen
cm of clay overlaid limestone bedrock in ST 12. Shovel test 13 and14 encountered 38 and
36 cm, respectively, of clay while ST 15 uncovered 36 cm of sandy clay. All of the
shovel tests were culturally sterile and no cultural materials older than 50 years were seen
on the ground surface.
The archaeologists then returned to where they had departed and again began to survey to
the northwest. Shovel tests 16 through 19 were placed along this portion of the survey
area. Shovel tests 16 and 17 encountered 40 and 35 cm of sandy clay below the ground
surface, respectively. However, ST 18 uncovered 29 cm of clay overlying bedrock
limestone. Twenty cm of sandy loam overlaid sandy clay subsoil in ST 19. The shovel
test was terminated at 35 cm below the ground surface. No cultural materials older than
50 years were seen on the ground surface or uncovered in shovel tests 16 through 19.
The surveyors then returned to the southeast corner and began north-south transects.
Shovel tests 20 through 27 were excavated during this portion of the survey. Shovel tests
were concentrated on the slight knoll. All of the shovel tests encountered culturally sterile
clay ranging from 35 to 40 cm below the ground surface. However, two potential historic

sites (built between 1936 and 1960) and one built between 1960 and 1973 were in this
portion of the survey area.

The only remnants of a structure found belonged to the concrete residence built between
1960 and 1973. It had been bulldozed (Figure 5) and there was an associated trash scatter
consisting of mattresses, toys, and plastic. Also, a fenced enclosure was about 20 m west
of the structure. The fenced area is approximately 60 feet north-south and 90 feet eastwest. Two metallic troughs were enclosed by the fence.

Conclusions
No cultural materials older than 50 years were found during the intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the study area or uncovered in 27 shovel tests. The absence of
prehistoric sites may be that they were along Denton Creek where sand was present along
the northern portion of the study area and, therefore, had been destroyed due to mining
activities. Historic sites had been present at one time, but the only structural remnants
belonged to a residence built between 1960 and 1973. The historic sites probably were
removed for farming practices and mesquite trees have invaded the area.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if cultural materials older than
50 years were present within the development tract. None were. Based upon the results of
the archaeological survey, AR Consultants recommends that further cultural resource
investigations and unwarranted and recommends to the Archeology Division that
construction of the Byron Nelson High School be allowed to begin. Also, we recommend
that if buried cultural materials older than fifty years are encountered, work should stop
in that area immediately and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be contacted. Work should not continue until discussions with the
Texas Historical Commission have been completed.
