MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Walker Partners, on
behalf of the Schertz-Seguin Local Government Corporation (SSLGC), to conduct a cultural
resources inventory survey and assessment for the proposed SSLGC Water System
Improvements Project in Guadalupe County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would involve
the construction of an approximately 28.5-kilometer- (17.7-mile-) long, 91.4-centimeter- (36.0inch-) diameter water supply pipeline; a water treatment plant, nine water well pads, and
approximately 8.1 kilometers (5.0 miles) of water gathering lines. The proposed water supply
pipeline would extend roughly from Schertz to Seguin, and the water well field, inclusive of the
proposed water plant, well pads, and gathering lines, would be located approximately
22.5 kilometers (14.0 miles) southeast of Seguin near Leesville. The linear rights-of-way (ROW)
of the proposed water supply pipeline and water well gathering lines are assumed to measure no
more than 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width, inclusive of permanent and temporary easements,
workspaces, and construction access roads. For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the
project area was considered to cover a maximum area of 129.7 hectares (320.6 acres), including
the approximately 28.5-kilometer- (17.7-mile-) long water supply pipeline (86.8 hectares
[214.5 acres]), the water treatment plant (8.8 hectares [21.8 acres]), the nine water well pads
(1.0 hectare [2.6 acres] each, for a total of 9.0 hectares [23.4 acres]), and 8.1 kilometers
(5.0 miles) of water gathering lines (24.6 hectares [60.9 acres]).
The proposed project is being sponsored by SSLGC, a political subdivision within the state
of Texas; as such, the proposed undertaking falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At this time, no federal permits or agency
involvement have been identified for the project. As the project consists of a publicly sponsored
undertaking with the potential to impact cultural resources, a cultural resources inventory and
assessment of the project area were required.
Between January and October 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana N. Smith, with
the assistance of archeological technicians Jacob Lyons, Stephanie Mueller, Jared Wiersema
and under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
cultural resources survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that may be impacted
by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the project area on foot and
thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources.

Management Summary

In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear project areas
measuring up to 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width; as such, 283 shovel tests would be required
within the 28.5-kilometer- (17.7-mile-) long water supply pipeline ROW, and 80 shovel tests would
be required within the 8.1 kilometers (5.0 miles) of water gathering line ROWs. In addition, for
block-area projects, the TSMASS require a minimum of two shovel tests per 0.4 hectare (1.0 acre)
for survey areas measuring between 0.8 and 4.0 hectares (2.0 and 10.0 acres) in size (i.e., the
water well pads) and one shovel test per 0.8 hectare (2.0 acres) for survey areas measuring
between 4.0 and 40.5 hectares (10.0 and 100.0 acres) in size (i.e., the water treatment plant site).
As such, five shovel tests would be required within each of the proposed 1.0-hectare (2.6-acre)
water well pads (for a total of 40 shovel tests among the nine proposed water well pad sites), and
12 shovel tests would be required within the proposed 9.0-hectare (23.4-acre) water treatment
plant location. A total of 415 shovel tests would be required for the project as a whole. Horizon
excavated a total of 310 shovel tests within the proposed water supply line ROW and 167 shovel
tests within the proposed water well field project area, for a total of 477 shovel tests, thereby
exceeding the TSMASS for a project area of this size and length.
The majority of the proposed water supply pipeline ROW parallels the utility easement of
an existing SSLGC water line. The proposed water supply pipeline ROW traverses mostly planted
and fallow fields as well as cattle pastures. Visibility of the modern ground surface ranged from
high in agricultural fields (100%) to relatively low in pastures and vegetated areas (<30%). The
pedestrian survey with shovel testing within the proposed water supply pipeline ROW typically
revealed shallow deposits of clay or clay loam overlying clay at depths ranging from 20.0 to
30.0 centimeters (7.9 to 11.8 inches) below surface.
The proposed water well field project area, which is composed of the water treatment
plant, nine water well pads, and water gathering lines, is situated in an area that ranges from
relatively flat, open pastureland to lightly wooded areas. Visibility of the modern ground surface
remained low in most areas due to dense grasses. The pedestrian survey with shovel testing
within the proposed water well field typically revealed moderately deep deposits of sandy and
clayey loam extending to depths of 30.0 to 70.0 centimeters (11.8 to 27.6 inches) overlying sandy
clay, though a few shovel contained loamy sediments to depths of 100.0 centimeters
(39.4 inches) or more below surface.
Six newly recorded archeological sites—41GU191, 41GU192, 41GU193, 41GU194,
41GU195, and 41GU197—and one previously recorded archeological site—41GU67—were
documented within the proposed water supply pipeline ROW during the survey. In addition, one
newly recorded archeological site—41GU196—was documented within the proposed water well
field project area on the proposed water treatment plant site. Sites 41GU67, 41GU192, 41GU193,
41GU194, and 41GU195 consist of scatters of aboriginal lithic debris in plowed fields that
generally appear to represent lithic raw material procurement areas (i.e., “quarries”). Site
41GU191 consists of a scatter of late 19th to mid-20th century domestic debris in a plowed field.
Site 41GU196 consists of a historic-age oil tank originally constructed ca. 1940-1945 that was
subsequently moved to its current location and modified for use as an agricultural storage

building. Site 41GU197 consists of a mid-20th-century barn and a dump of mixed mid-20thcentury and modern glass bottles and aluminum cans.
All eight archeological sites recorded during the survey are recommended as ineligible for
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas based on
the poor condition of the sites and their low potential to contribute meaningfully to an
understanding of the historic and/or prehistoric past. No further investigations are warranted on
these sites in connection with the proposed undertaking.
In addition, one cemetery—an unnamed cemetery in Haeckerville—is located partially
within the 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide cultural resources survey corridor, though the cemetery
does not extend within the proposed construction area associated with the current project. As
currently designed, the proposed pipeline centerline would pass 12.2 meters (40.0 feet) to the
southeast of the southeastern cemetery boundary, and the engineer is considering moving the
pipeline another 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) southeast to the other side of Town Creek. As such, a
buffer exceeding the required 7.6-meter (25.0-foot) buffer separates the proposed water supply
pipeline centerline from the fence that marks the southeastern cemetery boundary. The nearest
cluster of headstones is located another 7.6 meters (25.0 feet) northwest of the southeastern
cemetery fenceline, and a second cluster of headstones is present in the northern corner of the
cemetery. The cemetery appears to be relatively modern, which suggests that there is low
potential for unmarked burials. As such, the current project design would avoid any impacts to
the cemetery.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no
historic properties affected,” and no further archeological work is recommended in connection
with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are
protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or
burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) should be notified immediately.

Proposed Water System Improvements Project, Guadalupe County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Walker Partners, on
behalf of the Schertz-Seguin Local Government Corporation (SSLGC), to conduct a cultural
resources inventory survey and assessment for the proposed SSLGC Water System
Improvements Project in Guadalupe County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would involve
the construction of an approximately 28.5-kilometer- (17.7-mile-) long, 91.4-centimeter- (36.0inch-) diameter water supply pipeline; a water treatment plant, nine water well pads, and
approximately 8.1 kilometers (5.0 miles) of water gathering lines (Figures 1-1 to 1-5). The
proposed water supply pipeline would extend roughly from Schertz to Seguin, and the water well
field, inclusive of the proposed water plant, well pads, and gathering lines, would be located
approximately 22.5 kilometers (14.0 miles) southeast of Seguin near Leesville. The linear rightsof-way (ROW) of the proposed water supply pipeline and water well gathering lines was assumed
to measure no more than 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width, inclusive of permanent and temporary
easements, workspaces, and construction access roads. For purposes of the cultural resources
survey, the project area was considered to cover a maximum area of 129.7 hectares
(320.6 acres), including the approximately 28.5-kilometer- (17.7-mile-) long water supply pipeline
(86.8 hectares [214.5 acres]), the water treatment plant (8.8 hectares [21.8 acres]), the nine water
well pads (1.0 hectare [2.6 acres] each, for a total of 9.0 hectares [23.4 acres]), and 8.1 kilometers
(5.0 miles) of water gathering lines (24.6 hectares [60.9 acres]).
The proposed project is being sponsored by SSLGC, a political subdivision within the state
of Texas; as such, the proposed undertaking falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At this time, no federal permits or agency
involvement have been identified for the project. As the project includes a publicly sponsored
undertaking with the potential to impact cultural resources, a cultural resources inventory and
assessment of the project area was required.
Between January and October 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana N. Smith, with
the assistance of archeological technicians Jacob Lyons, Stephanie Mueller, Jared Wiersema
and under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed
undertaking. The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the project area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area traverses a mosaic of rolling uplands and narrow stream channels within
the Blackland Prairie and Interior Coastal Plains physiographic provinces. The Blackland Prairie
is a narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf
Coastal Plain to the east. This area consists of low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band
along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern
Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and
poor drainage; water often ponds after rainstorms, and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The
Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that arcs
across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone
bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked
by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the
entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology,
soil, vegetation, and animal life.
The Texas Coastal Plain, which extends as far north as the Ouachita uplift in southern
Oklahoma and westward to the Balcones Escarpment, consists of seaward-dipping bodies of
sedimentary rock, most of which are of terrigenous clastic origin, that reflect the gradual infilling
of the basin from its margins (Abbott 2001). This region is underlain by rocks and unconsolidated
sediments that are quite young in a geological sense, ranging from modern to Miocene in age.
These consist predominantly of a series of fluviodeltaic bodies arranged in an offlapped
sequence, with interdigitated and capping eolian, littoral, and estuarine facies making up a
relatively minor component of the lithology. Major bounding disconformities between these
formations are usually interpreted to represent depositional hiatuses that occurred during periods
of sea level low stand. The oldest rocks in this fill are of Late Cretaceous age. As a result of the
geometry of basin filling, successively younger rock units crop out in subparallel bands from the
basin margin toward the modern coastline.
Hydrologically, the project area is situated within the Guadalupe River watershed. The
Guadalupe River flows generally southeastwards across the Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal
Plain, discharging into the Gulf of Mexico at San Antonio Bay.

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

The proposed water well field project area traverses a series of rolling uplands situated
between Sandies Creek to the north and Clear Fork Creek to the south. A few unnamed
tributaries of these larger stream systems cross the project area, though these stream channels
are ephemeral, shallowly incised, and appear to have intermittent flows. Drainage within the
proposed water well field project area is to the north and south toward these two stream systems.
The proposed water supply pipeline ROW traverses a similar series of rolling uplands.
The western portion of the ROW is located north of Cibolo Creek, and a segment of the ROW
parallels the northern bank of Cibolo Creek for a short distance. This area constitutes the high
bank of the creek and the proposed ROW does not cross Cibolo Creek. From west to east, the
proposed water supply pipeline ROW crosses Town Creek twice (once near Haeckerville and
once between Haeckerville and Marion), an unnamed tributary of Santa Clara Creek southwest
of Marion, Santa Clara Creek proper east of Marion, several unnamed tributaries of Youngs Creek
between Marion and McQueeney, two unnamed tributaries of the Guadalupe River, and Deadman
Creek and two of its unnamed tributaries south of Interstate Highway (IH) 10. Drainage within the
proposed water supply pipeline project area is predominantly to the east toward the Guadalupe
River, with the exception of the western end of the proposed ROW, which drains southward
toward Cibolo Creek.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the proposed water well field project area is underlain by the Eocene-age
Queen City Sand Formation (Eoc), which is composed of sandstone and fine- to medium-grained
quartz that form massive to finely laminated bedding planes (Fisher 1983). Geomorphologically,
the proposed water well field project area is situated on sandy upland soils that formed in situ
from underlying sandstone bedrock (Figure 2-1; Table 2-1) (NRCS 2017). No Holocene-age
alluvial sediments are mapped within this portion of the overall project area.
The proposed water supply pipeline ROW is underlain by the Pleistocene-age Leona
Formation (Qle), which is composed of fine, calcareous silt grading down into coarse gravel
(Fisher 1983). Geomorphologically, the proposed water supply pipeline ROW traverses a mosaic
of upland and valley soils (Figures 2-2 to 2-4; Table 2-2) (NRCS 2017). Upland soils generally
consist of clayey residuum weathered in situ from calcareous mudstone bedrock. Bottomland
soils consist of calcareous clayey and loamy alluvium of Pleistocene to Holocene age.
In Central Texas, aboriginal archeological sites are commonly located adjacent to rivers
and streams as well as in upland environments. The portions of the project area that are situated
on upland ridges and paleoterraces possess low to moderate potential for aboriginal cultural
resources. The antiquity of these landforms suggests that any aboriginal cultural resources
present within the project area would be expected to occur on the modern ground surface or in
relatively shallowly buried subsurface contexts. The portions of the project area that are located
on Pleistocene-age alluvial deposits have moderate to high potential for aboriginal cultural
resources due to their proximity to natural water bodies; however, the antiquity of these floodplain

have moderate to high potential for aboriginal cultural resources both on the modern ground
surface and in subsurface contexts.
Historic-age resources may be found in virtually any physiographic environment but are
most common in urban settings and in rural areas suitable for agriculture. The proposed water
supply pipeline project area is located in predominantly rural areas in the vicinity of the
communities of Schertz and Seguin, while the proposed water well field project area is located in
a more remote rural setting. The lack of visible structures within or immediately adjacent to the
project area on historical topographic maps and aerial photographs tends to suggest that the
project area possesses low potential to contain historic-age architectural archeological resources,
though the presence of potential historic-age structures nearby suggests at least moderate
potential for historic-age archeological resources.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was considerably
cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was more heavily
forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late
Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying
trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by

HJN 160237 AR

17

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period,
the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable. The deciduous forests
had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming
trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there
appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to
5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental
conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
The modern climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild
winters. The climate is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of
Mexico, but it is modified by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate
throughout spring, summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide
a continental climate characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
In winter, the average temperature is 52 degrees Fahrenheit (°F); however, during winter
the temperature tends to fluctuate greatly as air masses move in and out of the area. These air
masses can produce light rain and drizzle, and conditions can become cloudy. Spring is relatively
dry, with some thunderstorms and cool spells. Summer temperatures are high, with the daily
maximum temperature often reaching or exceeding 90°F. Fall is warm, dry, and pleasant, with
increasing cold spells.
The average precipitation within the region is 83.8 centimeters (33.0 inches). The majority
of this precipitation occurs as rain that falls between April and September. The growing season
is approximately 265 days long.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair
1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces
and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943). Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. Rainfall in the Texan
province is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite (1948) as a
C2 (moist subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and
hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this soil
type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas include
the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies.
Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County and a series of peat and bog marshes
distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.

Proposed Water System Improvements Project, Guadalupe County, Texas

The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert pocket gopher
(Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse
(Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail rabbit
(Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), white-footed
mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Sylvilagus californicus), ground squirrel
(Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana), hispid pocket mouse
(Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus),
and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the Austroriparian province—
eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—occur in the Texan. Sixteen
species of lizards, including seven grassland and nine forest species, are also found, including
green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates), common ground
skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis [grassland species]), and
collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard (Sceloporus olivaceous), Texas horned
lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink (Eumeces obsoletus [forest species]).
Only five species of urodele fauna are known from this area, including small-mouthed salamander
(Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), and eastern lesser siren (Siren
intermedia), and the Texan province acts as a barrier to urodele distribution between the endemic
Balconian province fauna to the west and the Austroriparian fauna to the east. Anuran fauna is
composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed species, including eastern
spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad
(Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita),
gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea), North American bullfrog (Rana
catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrow-mouthed toad (Microhyla
carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the Texan into the Austroriparian
province include pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s chorus frog (Pseudacris
streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile and amphibian species
common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis sexlineata), rat snake
(Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough green snake
(Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback rattlesnake
(Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water snake (Nerodia
rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis). Common bird species include northern
bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida
macroura), killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo
jamaicensis), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon), and mockingbird
(Mimus polyglottos). Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric
and early historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al.
1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic
hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of
North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian
bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and
settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central
Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There
is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is
divided into two periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These

HJN 160237 AR

21

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points
(i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which
is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and
Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most markedly,
burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the Late
Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In addition,
the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute evidence
of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially accounts for the
lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases: the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed

22

Proposed Water System Improvements Project, Guadalupe County, Texas

South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay. However,
European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The first half of
the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as the first
effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social systems.
This process is clearly discernible at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data suggest population
declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation on the part of the
Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement of Texas began in
the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished.
In the central Texas region, including Guadalupe and Bexar counties, Indian tribes in the
area included the Karankawas, Tonkawas, Comanches, and Lipan Apaches.1 Hostilities with
Indians who camped along the Guadalupe River in the mid-1830s caused many of the early
settlers to retreat from their land to Gonzales until more protection could be provided. After the
Texas Revolution, the Tonkawas and the Lipan Apaches were friendly toward settlers and often
traded with them, but the threat of raids by the Comanches remained until the 1843 council at
Bird’s Fort. After the Mexican War in 1848, federal troops established a line of forts extending
from Fort Worth to Eagle Pass, effectively moving the frontier and the Indians well to the northwest
of Guadalupe County. The last Indian raid into the area was made by the Kickapoos in 1855.
The Spanish were probably the first Europeans to explore central Texas. Some sources suggest
that Álvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca came through this part of central Texas in 1534, but others
indicate that his route was farther south. Guadalupe County takes its name from the Guadalupe
River, which Alonso de Leon named in 1689 in honor of the Lady of Guadalupe depicted on his
standard. The Spanish government made one of the first land grants in the Guadalupe County
area to José de la Baume in 1806 for land in the Capote Hills. He had to confirm his claim with
the new government after Mexico won its independence from Spain and did not receive clear title
until 1832. Between 1827 and 1835, 22 families came to the area as part of DeWitt's colony, and
14 received grants directly from the Mexican government. Most of the settlers during this early
period came from the southern US. Many had land in the eastern part of the region along what
came to be called Nash, Darst, and Mill creeks. These early settlers scarcely had time to form
even the beginnings of communities before the combination of Indian raids and the Runaway
Scrape forced them to retreat to Gonzales.
After the Texas Revolution, the new government sent volunteer troops to protect people
in remote areas. Those settlers who had left because of the Indians and the Mexican army
returned, and others joined them. Much of the land given to Texas veterans for their service
during the revolution was located in what became Guadalupe County. A company of Texas
Rangers commanded by Capt. John Coffee Hays set up camp at Walnut Springs near the
Guadalupe River. In 1838, a group of former Texas Rangers and other settlers founded the
community of Walnut Springs on the northeast bank of the Guadalupe; its name was changed to
Seguin in 1839 to honor Juan N. Seguin. The presence of troops encouraged many incoming
families to stay near Seguin until the area became more secure. As a result, Seguin developed
earlier and more rapidly than other communities in the future county and became the region’s

center of social and economic life. It was the natural choice for county seat when Guadalupe
County was formed. The Republic of Texas organized Guadalupe County as a judicial county in
1842, but discontinued it later that year when the Texas Supreme Court declared judicial counties
to be unconstitutional. In March 1846, after the annexation of Texas to the US, the legislature
established the present county from parts of Bexar and Gonzales counties. Guadalupe County
had an area of 862 square miles in 1846 but lost land in 1858 and 1874, when Blanco and Wilson
counties were organized.
Early communities in Guadalupe County had little formal structure. They began as river
crossings, mills, churches, or schools that served widely scattered populations. Because of its
nearness to Gonzales, the Sycamore community between Nash and Darst creeks was one of the
first rural areas to be settled. German immigrants settled in northern and western parts of the
county in the mid-1840s as a result of the colonization efforts by Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels
at New Braunfels. Schumannsville and Clear Springs were established primarily by Germans.
By the late 1840s and early 1850s, other settlers had established themselves along York, Mill,
Elm, and Santa Clara creeks. The population of the county grew rapidly. The 1850 census
reported a total of 1,171 white residents; by 1860, that number had risen to 3,689. Many who
immigrated from other southern states brought slaves. The slave population rose from 335 in
1850 to 1,748 in 1860. Most of the slaveholders were small farmers. Of the 202 slaveholders in
the county, 20% owned only one slave, 28% owned two to four, 23% owned five to nine, and 27%
owned between 10 and 40. Only three slave owners had more than 40 slaves. For those families
who did not live in Seguin proper, the primary occupations were stock raising and farming. The
1860 census reported 395 farms in the county. The amount of improved acreage increased
dramatically between 1850 and 1860, rising from 4,433 to 42,115. There were significant
increases in harvests and livestock as well. Cotton production rose from 182 bales in 1850 to
3,424 bales in 1860 and corn from 80,330 bushels to 376,425. The number of cattle increased
from nearly 11,000 head to over 67,000, horses from just over 1,200 to nearly 13,000, hogs from
4,400 to 18,500, and sheep from 2,100 to nearly 7,600. Wool production rose from 4,281 pounds
to 43,672 pounds. On maps of the county, Seguin resembled the center of a bicycle wheel, with
roads leading out in all directions like spokes. It was a major market place as well as a shipping
point for the rest of the county. When a stage line began operating between New Braunfels and
Gonzales in 1847, Seguin was a popular stop. Several Guadalupe County residents found the
shipping business to be a profitable venture, although some became involved in the Cart War in
1854 and 1855. Stock raisers in the county began organizing cattle drives to California and New
Orleans in the 1850s. As a whole, the county did very well economically before the Civil War.
Between 1850 and 1860, the value of area farms and livestock increased nearly 600%.
The people who settled the county placed great value on education. Residents of Seguin
worked to establish Guadalupe College in 1848 and organized the Guadalupe High School
Association in 1849. When the association had financial difficulties in the 1850s, the women of
the area held a craft sale and supper to raise money, and the men held a fair. Often churches in
Seguin ran private schools, such as the Montgomery Institute. The Lutheran Church operated
Seguin's public schools in the 1880s and established Texas Lutheran College at Seguin in 1912.
Nearly every community in Guadalupe County either had its own school or was near a community
that did. Schools such as Live Oak, Elm Creek, Tiemann, Cibolo Valley, and Geronimo provided

24

Proposed Water System Improvements Project, Guadalupe County, Texas

the basic educational structure of the county until the district system was established in 1901.
The Methodists supposedly established the first church in the county at Seguin in 1841. Services
were held at the county courthouse until the church building was completed in 1849. By 1853,
Seguin had Baptist, Presbyterian, and Episcopal congregations, in addition to Methodist. The
Lutheran Church was organized in 1869. Catholics in the area occasionally received sacraments
from a visiting bishop, but more frequently traveled to San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio.
Most communities in outlying areas had a small church of some sort that doubled as a
schoolhouse and served as the center of social life for those people who could not go all the way
to Seguin. When cars came into general use, many of the small churches closed, and their
congregations began attending services in Seguin.
Guadalupe County was staunchly Democratic before the Civil War. When the Seguin
Mercury, the county’s first newspaper, began publication in 1853, residents took great interest in
state and national affairs. There was enough difference of opinion to encourage the publication
of a second newspaper, the Seguin Journal, in 1856. The 1857 gubernatorial campaign provided
lively copy; the Journal supported Sam Houston and French Smith for governor and lieutenant
governor, and the Mercury supported the states’ rights candidates Hardin R. Runnels and Francis
R. Lubbock. The Mercury changed its name to the Southern Confederacy in February 1861, and
the Journal became the Union Democrat. Support for the Confederacy proved to be the majority
opinion, however. John Ireland and William P. Hardeman, 2 secessionists, represented the
county at the Secession Convention held in Austin on January 28, 1861, and voters in Guadalupe
County approved the secession ordinance by a 314 to 22 margin. In the spring of 1861, Nathaniel
Benton organized the first Guadalupe County company to fight for the Confederacy. The men
trained at Camp Clark before going to Virginia as Company D of the Fourth Regiment of Texas
Volunteers of Hood’s Texas Brigade. Benton, who was unable go to Virginia with Company D,
later organized a volunteer cavalry company, which became Company B of the Thirty-second
Texas Cavalry Regiment under Peter Cavanaugh Woods. In the fall of 1861, John Ireland
recruited a group that became Company K of the Eighth Texas Regiment, which served along the
Texas coast and in Louisiana. The Guadalupe Rebels, an independent military company that
was organized in July 1861, trained at Camp Beauregard near the site of present McQueeney,
but later dispersed to merge with other troops. A group known as the Guadalupe Rangers, a
volunteer cavalry company organized in September 1861 by John Preston White, became part of
the Twenty-fifth Brigade of the Texas Militia. During the war, one of the major shipping routes to
Mexico crossed the Guadalupe River near Seguin, giving Guadalupe County access to markets
in spite of the Union blockade of Confederate ports, but manufactured goods, sugar, coffee,
medicines, and cash remained in short supply. Because most men of military age had enlisted in
the Confederate Army by the end of 1861, women, children, old men, and slaves were left to keep
up family farms. Many acres lay idle for lack of enough people to work them.
Although the end of the war was welcome, many people had no desire to have their local
government “reconstructed.” Residents of Guadalupe County chose John Ireland as delegate to
the state constitutional convention that met in Austin on February 7, 1866, and elected Nathaniel
Benton chief justice in July 1866. Although these men received amnesty and were acceptable
officeholders according to the presidential reconstruction plan, they and most of the other new
county officials were removed from their offices in November 1867. In spite of threatened violence

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

and bitter feelings on the part of residents, however, Guadalupe saw little of the bitter strife that
many other counties experienced during this period. A Freedmen’s Bureau office opened in
Seguin in 1866 and supervised work contracts between former slaves and area farmers until
1868. Some blacks stayed in Seguin; others became sharecroppers or tenant farmers; still others
settled in the southeastern part of the county. The communities of Capote and Sweet Home were
established by former slaves. As a percentage of the total population, the number of blacks in
the county steadily declined, falling from a high of 34% in 1870 to 6% in 1980. In real numbers,
the black population, which numbered 2,534 in 1870, peaked at 5,681 in 1910 and fell to 3,155
by 1980.
The county voted Democratic in presidential elections from the end of Reconstruction until
1892. By the turn of the century, bitter feelings had receded, perhaps tempered by those people
who had arrived after the Civil War. In 1896, the county voted Republican, preferring William
McKinley to William Jennings Bryan, and contrary to the usual voting trends in the state.
Democratic presidential candidates carried the county only five times between 1896 and 1992—
Woodrow Wilson in 1912, Al Smith in 1928, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 and 1936, and Lyndon
B. Johnson in 1964.
Guadalupe County suffered a severe economic decline immediately following the Civil
War and throughout the Reconstruction period. In 1866, residents experienced a 69% loss in
taxable property. About 35% of the lost property was in slaves; the rest came from declines in
total farm acreage, farm value, and livestock value, each of which had fallen nearly 50% by the
time of the 1870 census. The county received a much-needed economic boost in the mid-1870s
when construction of the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio Railway began. The railroad
reached Seguin in 1876 and was completed to San Antonio in 1877, giving residents of
Guadalupe County easier access to markets. The towns of Kingsbury, Marion, McQueeney,
Cibolo, and Schertz grew up along the railroad. Area farmers could sell livestock for good prices
without the risks involved in extended cattle drives. Many farmers imported fencing supplies and
heavy ginning machinery. Cotton became a major crop after the county recovered from the Civil
War and Reconstruction. In 1880, farmers planted over 16,000 acres in cotton, 12% of the
county’s improved acreage; by 1900, cotton covered more than 100,000 acres, 59% of the
improved land. Production peaked in 1900 at 38,960 bales. As farmers continued to devote more
land to cotton, the soil became depleted, resulting in fewer bales per acre. By 1930, 118,300
acres yielded only 8,266 bales. The low yields, combined with the onset of the Great Depression,
encouraged farmers to plant more corn or to devote more of their resources to livestock. The
poultry industry, which had been growing steadily since the 1880s, took a sizable jump, from
171,000 in 1920 to 268,000 in 1930. Tenant farming and sharecropping, which had accounted
for the operation of 25% of the county’s farms in 1880, increased steadily, peaking at 64% in
1930. The depression forced some people, many of them tenants, to leave the county; farms lost
nearly 50% of their value between 1930 and 1940. The population of the county fell by nearly
10% during this period. The tenant system declined as the economy improved in the 1940s. By
1950, only about a quarter of the farms were run by tenants; that figure had declined to 6% by
1982.

Between 1870 and 1910, the number of immigrants coming to Guadalupe County rose
dramatically. People arrived from Russia, Poland, England, Wales, Ireland, France, Austria, and
Switzerland. The greatest increase, however, was in arrivals from Mexico. In 1870, there were
130 native Mexicans, less than 2% of the county’s total population; by 1910, there were 2,863,
representing 11.5% of the population. Some of the new immigrants were able to buy land of their
own. Others worked on cotton farms as laborers, sharecroppers, or tenants, partially filling the
gap in the work force caused by the abolition of slavery. The German-Americans were the
dominant influence in the shaping of the county’s cultural identity. By the 1880s, more than 40%
of the population was of German descent. The immigration rate from 1870 to 1900 was such that
native Germans consistently represented about 10% of the population. As World War I began in
Europe in 1914, many German-Americans in the county were sympathetic to the German cause.
When the US entered the war three years later, the atmosphere became very emotionally
charged. Things German were often viewed with suspicion and tended to be suppressed. The
end of the war soothed strained relationships as well as relieving the worries of soldiers’ families.
The Guadalupe River was developed in the late 1920s and early 1930s as a source of
hydroelectric power. A series of privately owned dams channeled water through generating
plants, providing electricity for the surrounding area. Lakes Dunlap and McQueeney, as well as
several smaller lakes, were formed by the dams and have become popular recreational sites. Oil
was discovered by H.H. Weinert in eastern Guadalupe County in the early 1920s (in the Darst
Creek oilfield), and although the new industry in no way rivaled agriculture in its importance to the
county’s economy, it did provide some diversity. The Luling, Dunlap, Darst, and La Vernia fields
were still active in the 1980s. In 1982, wells in the county produced 1,693,730 barrels of crude
oil and 976,823 cubic feet of gas. Although no war supply contracts or facility projects were
assigned to Guadalupe County in the 1940s, the area did take part in the economic prosperity
generated by World War II. Manufacturing establishments in the county more than doubled the
number of their employees between 1940 and 1947. The per capita wage doubled as well. The
county’s proximity to San Antonio encouraged many residents to commute. In agriculture,
emphasis continued to shift from cotton to grains and livestock as a part of the war effort.
In the 1980s, as much as 80% of the land in Guadalupe County was used for farming and
ranching. Among the primary crops were sorghum, hay, oats, wheat, and corn; watermelon and
peaches were also popular, and the county’s pecan production was sixth in the state. Over 70%
of the county’s agricultural receipts in 1982 came from livestock and livestock products, mainly
cattle, hogs, poultry, and milk. Although agriculture continued to be an important aspect of the
economy, farm receipts represented only 12% of the county’s annual income in 1985.
Professional and related services, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade involved nearly
60% of the work force in 1982. Mineral resources, including ceramic clay, industrial sand, oil,
gas, and lignite coal, gave residents the opportunity to diversify their interests. In recent years,
many people have moved to Guadalupe County from San Antonio, choosing to live in Guadalupe
County and work in Bexar. In 1982, 46% of the work force was employed outside the county.
Between 1960 and 1980, the population of Guadalupe County rose nearly 40%, from 29,017 to
46,708; in 1990 the population was 64,873.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon performed background archival research on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) for information on previously recorded cultural
resources sites and historic properties as well as previous cultural resources investigations
conducted in the vicinity of the proposed project area. Based on this archival research, no
previously recorded sites or cemeteries are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the
proposed water well field project area (Figure 4-1). Twenty known archeological sites and six
cemeteries are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the proposed water supply
pipeline ROW (Figures 4-2 to 4-3; Table 4-1) (THC 2017).
One of the 20 previously recorded archeological sites located in the vicinity of the
proposed water supply pipeline ROW, one known archeological site—41GU67—is located within
the project area. Site 41GU67 was originally recorded in July 2001 as an Early Archaic to Late
Prehistoric lithic procurement area with multiple projectile point styles represented as well as
scrapers, hammer stones, flakes, cores, and tested chert cobbles. The THC determined the site
to be ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation
as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
In addition, one cemetery—an unnamed cemetery in Haeckerville—is located partially
within the 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide cultural resources survey corridor, though the cemetery
does not extend within the proposed construction area associated with the current project. As
currently designed, the proposed pipeline centerline would pass 12.2 meters (40.0 feet) to the
southeast of the southeastern cemetery boundary, and the engineer is considering moving the
pipeline another 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) southeast to the other side of Town Creek. As such, a
buffer exceeding the required 7.6-meter (25.0-foot) buffer separates the proposed water supply
pipeline centerline from the fence that marks the southeastern cemetery boundary. The nearest
cluster of headstones is located another 7.6 meters (25.0 feet) northwest of the southeastern
cemetery fenceline, and a second cluster of headstones is present in the northern corner of the
cemetery. The cemetery appears to be relatively modern, which suggests that there is low
potential for unmarked burials. As such, the current project design would avoid any impacts to
the cemetery.
One prior linear cultural resources survey crossed the proposed water well field project
area at two locations, including one of the proposed gathering line ROWs and the northeastern

corner of the proposed water treatment plant site. However, the vast majority of the proposed
water well field project area has not been previously surveyed.
Several prior linear cultural resources surveys cross the western portion of the proposed
water supply pipeline ROW between Schertz and Marion, and the easternmost 2.6 kilometers (1.6
miles) of the proposed ROW is located adjacent to and partially within a prior linear survey corridor
associated with an earlier water supply pipeline constructed by the SSLGC in 2000 (Turpin 2000).
Large portions of the current water supply pipeline are co-located with this existing water supply
pipeline, though the TASA only shows the prior archeological survey overlapping with the
easternmost portion of the current project area. According to the THC’s TASA, the majority of the
proposed water supply pipeline ROW has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

Between January and October 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana N. Smith, with
the assistance of archeological technicians Jacob Lyons, Stephanie Mueller, Jared Wiersema
and under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
cultural resources survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that may be impacted
by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the project area on foot and
thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. The proposed water well field project area, which is composed of the water treatment
plant, nine water well pads, and water gathering lines, is situated in an area that ranges from
relatively flat, open pastureland to lightly wooded areas. Visibility of the modern ground surface
remained low in most areas due to dense grasses (Figures 5-1 to 5-4). The majority of the
proposed water supply pipeline ROW parallels the utility easement of an existing SSLGC water
line. The proposed water supply pipeline ROW traverses mostly planted and fallow fields as well
as cattle pastures. Visibility of the modern ground surface ranged from high in agricultural fields
(100%) to relatively low in pastures and vegetated areas (<30%) (Figures 5-5 to 5-12).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear project areas
measuring up to 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width; as such, 283 shovel tests would be required
within the 28.5-kilometer- (17.7-mile-) long water supply pipeline ROW, and 80 shovel tests would
be required within the 8.1 kilometers (5.0 miles) of water gathering line ROWs. In addition, for
block-area projects, the TSMASS require a minimum of two shovel tests per 0.4 hectare (1.0 acre)
for survey areas measuring between 0.8 and 4.0 hectares (2.0 and 10.0 acres) in size (i.e., the
water well pads) and one shovel test per 0.8 hectare (2.0 acres) for survey areas measuring
between 4.0 and 40.5 hectares (10.0 and 100.0 acres) in size (i.e., the water treatment plant site).
As such, five shovel tests would be required within each of the proposed 1.0-hectare (2.6-acre)
water well pads (for a total of 40 shovel tests among the nine proposed water well pad sites), and
12 shovel tests would be required within the proposed 9.0-hectare (23.4-acre) water treatment
plant location. A total of 415 shovel tests would be required for the project as a whole. Horizon
excavated a total of 310 shovel tests within the proposed water supply line ROW and 167 shovel
tests within the proposed water well field project area, for a total of 477 shovel tests, thereby
exceeding the TSMASS for a project area of this size and length. Specific shovel test data are
summarized in tabular format in Appendix A, and shovel test location maps are presented in
Appendix B.

Chapter 5.0: Survey Methodology

The pedestrian survey with shovel testing within the proposed water supply pipeline ROW
typically revealed shallow deposits of clay or clay loam overlying clay at depths ranging from
20.0 to 30.0 centimeters (7.9 to 11.8 inches) below surface. The pedestrian survey with shovel
testing within the proposed water well field typically revealed moderately deep deposits of sandy
and clayey loam extending to depths of 30.0 to 70.0 centimeters (11.8 to 27.6 inches) overlying
sandy clay, though a few shovel contained loamy sediments to depths of 100.0 centimeters
(39.4 inches) or more below surface.
In general, shovel tests measured approximately 30.0 centimeters (11.8 inches) in
diameter, and all sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter (mm) (0.25-in) hardware cloth.
The UTM coordinates of all shovel tests were determined using hand-held Garmin ForeTrex
global positioning system (GPS) devices based on North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log
was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources. Diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No cultural resources were collected during the survey.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Six newly recorded archeological sites—41GU191, 41GU192, 41GU193, 41GU194,
41GU195, and 41GU197—and one previously recorded archeological site—41GU67—were
documented within the proposed water supply pipeline ROW during the survey. In addition, one
newly recorded archeological site—41GU196—was documented within the proposed water well
field project area on the proposed water treatment plant site (Figures 6-1 and 6-2). Sites 41GU67,
41GU192, 41GU193, 41GU194, and 41GU195 consist of scatters of aboriginal lithic debris in
plowed fields that generally appear to represent lithic raw material procurement areas (i.e.,
“quarries”). Site 41GU191 consists of a scatter of late 19th to mid-20th century domestic debris
in a plowed field. Site 41GU196 consists of a historic-age oil tank originally constructed ca. 19401945 that was subsequently moved to its current location and modified for use as an agricultural
storage building. Site 41GU197 consists of a mid-20th-century barn and a dump of mixed mid20th-century and modern glass bottles and aluminum cans. Each site is described individually
below.
In addition, one cemetery—an unnamed cemetery in Haeckerville—is located partially
within the 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide cultural resources survey corridor, though the cemetery
does not extend within the proposed construction area associated with the current project. As
currently designed, the proposed pipeline centerline would pass 12.2 meters (40.0 feet) to the
southeast of the southeastern cemetery boundary, and the engineer is considering moving the
pipeline another 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) southeast to the other side of Town Creek. As such, a
buffer exceeding the required 7.6-meter (25.0-foot) buffer separates the proposed water supply
pipeline centerline from the fence that marks the southeastern cemetery boundary. The nearest
cluster of headstones is located another 7.6 meters (25.0 feet) northwest of the southeastern
cemetery fenceline, and a second cluster of headstones is present in the northern corner of the
cemetery. The cemetery appears to be relatively modern, which suggests that there is low
potential for unmarked burials. As such, the current project design would avoid any impacts to
the cemetery.

SITE 41GU67
General Description

Site 41GU67 was originally recorded in July 2001 during a cultural resources survey for a
prior water supply pipeline conducted for the SSLGC (Turpin 2001). The site was recorded as a

surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts, including dart points, scrapers, hammerstones, flakes,
cores, and tested cobbles. Temporally diagnostic artifacts associated with the site at that time
included Pederrnales, Bulverde, Martindale, Marcos, Scallorn, and Darl projectile points as well
as a Clear Fork gouge, which are generally indicative of Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric
occupations. Many of the temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed in a private collection
owned by Mr. Alton Dreyer. Shovel testing conducted on the site revealed that the site had been
heavily disturbed by plowing, and relic hunting by private collectors had selectively removed many
temporally diagnostic artifacts from the site. Natural chert-bearing gravels were ubiquitous on the
site, suggesting that it probably served as a lithic raw material procurement site (i.e., “quarry”).
Based on the extent of prior disturbances and the relatively low research potential of the remaining
archeological deposits, the THC determined the site to be ineligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
Horizon’s archeologists revisited site 41GU67 during the current survey. Based on the
results of Horizon’s investigations, site 41GU67 consists of a moderate-density surficial and
shallow subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic tools and debris on the crest and east-facing slopes
of a prominent upland formation (Figure 6-3; also see Figure 6-2). The site overlooks an
unnamed tributary of Youngs Creek, which flows northeastward to the east of the documented
site area. Cultural materials observed on the site include bifaces, tested chert cobbles, and
secondary and tertiary flakes. Approximately the western half of the site is situated within a
planted corn field, and the eastern half is located in an open cattle pasture covered with short
grasses (Figure 6-4). Natural chert-bearing gravels are abundant on the site, confirming the likely
use of the site as a lithic raw material procurement locality (i.e., “quarry”) in the prehistoric past
(Figure 6-5). Elevations on the site range from approximately 176.8 to 194.2 meters (580.0 to
637.0 feet) amsl, sloping down to the east toward the unnamed tributary of Youngs Creek.
Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural resources observed on the modern ground surface and in
subsurface shovel tests, site 41GU67 measures approximately 550.0 meters (1,804.0 feet) east
to west by 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) north to south within the current project area. When the site
was originally recorded in 2001, the dimensions of the site were delineated as measuring
approximately 350.0 by 350.0 meters (1,148.0 by 1,148.0 feet), though the site is mapped only
as a single point, or centroid, on the THC’s TASA. As such, it would appear that the original site
recorders investigated areas of the site located beyond their linear survey corridor. Horizon did
not pursue the site boundaries beyond the current project’s 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide survey
corridor, though it would appear based on the original investigations that the site extends farther
to the north and south beyond the current project area’s boundaries.
Cultural materials on site 41GU67 are largely constrained to the modern ground surface,
though two of the eight shovel tests excavated on the site revealed subsurface cultural materials
extending to depths of 10.0 to 15.0 centimeters (3.9 to 5.9 inches) below surface. As the western
half of the site consists of a plowed field, it is probable that other cultural resources have been
incorporated into the active plowzone, though there is no meaningful subsurface context to the
archeological deposits on the site.

Observed Cultural Features
No intact cultural features or cultural materials indicative of cultural features, such as
burned rocks or heated or burned chert, were observed on site 41GU67.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GU67 include bifaces, tested chert cobbles, and
secondary and tertiary flakes (Figure 6-6). Natural chert-bearing gravels are abundant on the
site, confirming the likely use of the site as a lithic raw material procurement locality (i.e., “quarry”)
in the prehistoric past. No temporally diagnostic cultural materials were observed during
Horizon’s investigations. Similarly, the original site recorders noted that the site had been heavily
“picked over” by artifact collectors when the site was initially recorded in 2001. However, the
original recorders had the opportunity to examine an artifact collection in the possession of Mr.
Alton Dreyers that contained artifacts diagnostic of the Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods,
including Pedernales, Bulverde, Martindale, Marcos, Scallorn, and Darl projectile points as well
as a Clear Fork gouge. No burned rocks, heated or burned chert, or preserved floral or faunal
remains were observed on the site during either the original or current investigations.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GU67 consists of a moderate-density surface and shallow subsurface scatter of
aboriginal lithic debris located on the crest and east-facing slopes of a hill that overlooks an
unnamed tributary of Youngs Creek to the east. The western half of the site is currently an active

corn field, and the eastern half is a grassy cattle pasture. Cultural materials observed on site
41GU67 include bifaces, tested chert cobbles, and secondary and tertiary flakes. Natural chertbearing gravels are abundant on the site, confirming the likely se of the site as a lithic raw material
procurement locality (i.e., “quarry”) in the prehistoric past. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were
observed on the site, though projectile points and other tools indicative of prehistoric occupations
ranging from the Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods were observed in a collection of artifacts
in the possession of a local artifact collector when the site was initially recorded in 2001.
The largely surficial archeological deposits on site 41GU67 have been heavily disturbed
by plowing and construction of an existing SSLGC water supply pipeline that parallels the current
proposed pipeline ROW. In addition, the site has apparently been scoured by artifact collectors
over the years, which has resulted in the bulk of the temporally diagnostic artifacts being removed
from the site and placed in private collections. No cultural features or intact archeological deposits
were observed within the portion of the site located within the current project area during Horizon’s
investigations. Based on the extent of prior disturbances and the low research potential, site
41GU67 was determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and/or for designation as an
SAL based on the original investigations conducted on the site in 2001. Horizon’s investigations
have confirmed the poor condition of the site. While the site appears to extend outside the
boundaries of the current project area to the north and south, Horizon recommends that the
portion of the site within the current project area is noncontributing to the overall eligibility of the
site for designation as an SAL. No further investigations are recommended on site 41GU67 in
connection with the proposed undertaking.

6.2

SITE 41GU191
General Description

Site 41GU191 consists of a moderate-density, surface and shallow subsurface scatter of
historic-age domestic debris situated on an upland landform or paleoterrace overlooking Town
Creek to the south (Figure 6-7; also sees Figure 6-2). Cultural materials observed on the site
include glass shards (aqua, violet, blue, brown, black, and clear), whiteware ceramic sherds,
several brick fragments, a horseshoe, a barrel hoop, a square nail, and various pieces of metal
scrap. No architectural features or other cultural features were observed. The site is located on
a parcel of land (Property ID 61885) bounded by Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 78 on the north and
by Town Creek on the south. The site is located toward the “back,” or southern, side of the parcel,
and no roads or driveways provide access to this location. The site is located in an open field
covered with tall grasses and scattered mesquite trees, prickly pear cacti, and pencil cholla cacti
(Figure 6-8). Overall, ground surface visibility ranged between 0 and 15%. Elevations across
this small site are relatively flat, averaging approximately 192.7 meters (632.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural resources observed on the modern ground surface and in
subsurface shovel tests, site 41GU191 measures approximately 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) east to
west by 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) north to south.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

Figure 6-8. Overview of Site 41GU191 (Facing West)

Cultural materials on site 41GU191 are constrained largely to the modern ground surface,
though one of the six shovel tests excavated on the site contained two clear glass shards at
depths of 0.0 to 10.0 centimeters (0.0 to 3.9 inches) below surface. It is probable that other
cultural resources have been incorporated within shallow subsurface sediments by historical
agricultural practices, but there is no meaningful subsurface context to the archeological deposits
on the site.
Observed Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on site 41GU191. However, the presence of structural
remnants such as brick fragments, window glass shards, and a square nail suggests that a
structure may have been present here at one time.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GU191 site include aqua, clear, amber, blue, violet,
and black glass shards; whiteware ceramic sherds (some of which are decorated); one heavily
oxidized square nail; one iron horseshoe; one iron stove handle; one metal barrel ring; one
complete machine-made clear glass bottle; one embossed amber glass bottle fragment; window
glass fragments; red brick fragments; and unidentified pieces of metal scrap (Figures 6-9 to 610). A few of the observed artifacts, including the amethyst glass shards and the single square

nail, potentially date as early as the late 19th century, though most of the cultural materials are
only broadly diagnostic of the late 19th to mid-20th centuries.
Historical Research
The property on which site 41GU191 is situated (Property ID 61885) was owned by Eddie
Wagner prior to conveyance of the property to Fred Wagner in 2010 (GAD 2017). No other
property transfers are on record in the Guadalupe Appraisal District’s online database. While it
is unknown if the Wagner family owned the property within the late 19th- to mid-20th-century
timeframe suggested by the cultural remains on the site, the Wagner family is not known to be of
historical significance within Guadalupe County (TSHA 2017).
A review of historical aerial imagery extending back to at least 1955 (the earliest aerial
photograph examined) and US Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps extending back to
1927 (the earliest topographic map examined) indicate that no structures have been present at
the location of site 41GU191 since at least the early or mid-20th century (NETR 2017). The parcel
(Property ID 61885) on which site 41GU191 is located is bounded on the north by FM 78 on the
north and by Town Creek on the south. The site is located toward the “back,” or southern, side
of the parcel, and no roads or driveways provide access to this location. A small farmstead is
present on this parcel off the southern side of FM 78 approximately 0.5 kilometer (0.3 mile)
northeast of the site that is visible on historic-age aerial photographs extending back to 1955 and
on USGS topographic maps extending back to 1961, and it is possible that the debris scatter
observed on site 41GU191 is associated with this farm.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GU191 consists of a moderate-density, surface and shallow subsurface scatter of
historic-age domestic debris situated on an upland landform or paleoterrace overlooking Town
Creek to the south. Cultural materials observed on the site include glass shards (aqua, violet,
blue, brown, black, and clear), whiteware ceramic sherds, several brick fragments, a horseshoe,
a barrel hoop, a square nail, and various pieces of metal scrap. A few of the observed artifacts,
including the amethyst glass shards and the single square nail, potentially date as early as the
late 19th century, though most of the cultural materials are only broadly diagnostic of the late
19th to mid-20th centuries. No architectural features or other cultural features were observed.
The presence of structural remnants such as brick fragments, window glass shards, and a square
nail suggests that a structure may have been present here at one time, though no structures are
visible at this location on historic aerial images or topographic maps extending back to at least
the early or mid-20th century.
The site is located on a parcel of land (Property ID 61885) bounded by FM 78 on the north
and by Town Creek on the south. The site is located toward the “back,” or southern, side of the
parcel, and no roads or driveways provide access to this location. The site may be associated
with a historic-age farmstead located on the same parcel approximately 0.5 kilometer (0.3 mile)
to the northeast owned by the Wagner family. As the farmstead proper is located well beyond
the boundaries of the project area, it was not investigated during the survey, and it is unknown if
the farm is currently occupied or in use. Site 41GU191 may simply represent a dump of historic-

age farming debris, the location of a former agricultural outbuilding, or possibly even an original
house that was moved or demolished prior to the mid-20th century, by which time is it apparent
that the primary farmstead on this parcel was located farther to the northeast. However, the lack
of any evidence of a well or cistern would tend to argue against this being the location of a
residential structure or a primary farmstead, suggesting instead that an agricultural outbuilding,
such as a small stable or storage building, was sited here.
Site 41GU191 has been heavily disturbed from the intentional demolition of whatever
structure may once have been situated at this location, by historical agricultural practices, and by
construction of an overhead transmission line and existing water supply pipeline that pass eastto-west along the northern boundary of the investigated site area. Overall, the largely surficial
archeological deposits on site 41GU191 lack integrity, the site is in poor condition, and the site
possesses minimal research value. The only property owners on record do not appear to be of
any particular historical note. While the site may extend somewhat outside the boundaries of the
current project area to the north and south, the artifact scatter seems to be fairly limited in size,
and the site is likely not much larger than the area documented within the project area. Horizon
recommends that the portion of the site within the current project area is noncontributing to the
overall eligibility of the site for designation as an SAL. No further investigations are recommended
on site 41GU191 in connection with the proposed undertaking.

6.3

SITE 41GU192
General Description

Site 41GU192 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts
situated on a gently sloping upland formation or paleoterrace west of an unnamed tributary of
Santa Clara Creek, which flows southward approximately 0.6 kilometer (0.4 mile) east of the site
(Figure 6-11; also see Figure 6-2). Cultural materials observed on the site include approximately
10 tested chert cobbles, one core, five primary flakes, and 10 burned limestone rocks. Natural
chert cobbles are abundant on the site and in the surrounding area, suggesting that the site likely
functioned as a lithic raw material procurement locality (i.e., “quarry”). The site is situated within
a plowed agricultural field, and vegetation was largely absent, affording 100% visibility of the
modern ground surface (Figure 6-12). Elevations on the site range from approximately 194.8 to
195.7 meters (639.0 to 642.0 feet) amsl, sloping down gradually to the east toward the unnamed
tributary of Santa Clara Creek.
Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural resources observed on the modern ground surface, site
41GU192 measures approximately 150.0 meters (492.0 feet) east to west by 30.5 meters
(100.0 feet) north to south within the current project area. Site boundaries were only delineated
within the linear proposed water supply pipeline ROW, and the site may extend farther to the north
and south outside the project area.

Cultural materials on site 41GU192 appear to be constrained to the modern ground
surface. No cultural materials were observed in any of the six shovel tests excavated on the site,
though it is likely that some artifacts have been incorporated within the active plowzone.
Observed Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the site. However, the presence of a few scattered
burned rocks suggests that burned rock features, such as hearths, may have been present on
the site at one time.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on the site include approximately 10 tested chert cobbles, one
core, five primary flakes, and 10 burned rocks (Figure 6-13). No temporally diagnostic cultural
materials or evidence of preserved floral or faunal remains were observed.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GU192 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts within
a plowed field situated to the west of an unnamed tributary of Santa Clara Creek. Cultural
materials observed on the site include tested chert cobbles, a core, several primary flakes and
scattered burned rocks. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed, and the site can only
be dated to an undetermined prehistoric timeframe. No cultural features were observed, though

may have been present at one time. Natural chert cobbles are abundant on the site and in the
surrounding area, suggesting that the site likely functioned as a lithic raw material procurement
locality (i.e., “quarry”).
Site 41GU192 has been heavily disturbed by plowing and erosion, and cultural materials
on the site appear to be entirely surficial. In addition, an overhead transmission line and a

SITE 41GU193
General Description

Site 41GU193 consists of a small, low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts
on a gently sloping upland landform or paleoterrace south of an unnamed tributary of Santa Clara
Creek, which flows southward approximately 0.2 kilometer (0.1 mile) west of the site (Figure 614; also see Figure 6-2). Cultural materials observed on the site include one biface, two flakes,

and several tested chert cobbles. Natural chert cobbles are abundant on the site and in the
surrounding area, suggesting that the site likely functioned as a lithic raw material procurement
locality (i.e., “quarry”). The site is situated within a plowed agricultural field, and vegetation
consists of short, scattered grasses and the remnants of a harvested corn crop (Figure 6-15).
Ground surface visibility was high, ranging between 70% and 100%. Elevations on the site range
from approximately 193.0 to 193.6 meters (633.0 to 635.0 feet) amsl, sloping down slightly to the
west toward the unnamed tributary of Santa Clara Creek.
Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural resources observed on the modern ground surface, site
41GU193 measures approximately 70.0 meters (229.6 feet) northeast to southwest by
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) northwest to southeast within the current project area. Site boundaries
were only delineated within the linear proposed water supply pipeline ROW, and the site may
extend farther to the north and south outside the project area. However, given the small size of
the site and the sparseness of cultural materials, it is unlikely that the site extends far beyond the
boundaries of the project area.
Cultural materials on site 41GU193 appear to be constrained to the modern ground
surface. No cultural materials were observed in any of the six shovel tests excavated on the site,
though it is likely that some artifacts have been incorporated within the active plowzone.

deriving from possible hearth features, were observed on site 41GU193.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on the site include one chert biface, one chert secondary
flake, one chert tertiary flake, and several tested chert cobbles (Figure 6-16). No temporally

Site 41GU193 has been heavily disturbed by plowing and erosion, and cultural materials
on the site appear to be entirely surficial. In addition, a subsurface water pipeline passes
northeast to southwest along the northwestern boundary of the documented site area.

SITE 41GU194
General Description

Site 41GU194 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts on the
crest and south-facing slopes of an upland ridge that overlooks an unnamed, intermittent tributary
of the Guadalupe River to the south (Figure 6-17; also see Figure 6-2). Cultural materials
observed on the site include a core, several secondary and tertiary flakes, and several tested
chert cobbles. Natural chert cobbles are abundant on the site and in the surrounding area,
suggesting that the site likely functioned as a lithic raw material procurement locality (i.e., “quarry”)
(Figure 6-18). The site is situated within a fallow agricultural field, and vegetation consists of
scattered grasses and weeds as well as remnants of a harvested corn crop (Figure 6-19). Ground
surface visibility was high, ranging between 70% and 100%. Elevations on the site range from
approximately 181.4 to 192.1 meters (595.0 to 630.0 feet) amsl, sloping down moderately
strongly to the south toward the unnamed tributary of Santa Clara Creek.
Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural resources observed on the modern ground surface, site
41GU194 measures approximately 200.0 meters (656.0 feet) northwest to southeast by
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) northeast to southwest within the current project area. Site boundaries
were delineated only within the linear proposed water supply pipeline ROW, and the site may
extend farther to the northeast and southwest outside the current project area.
Cultural materials on site 41GU194 appear to be constrained to the modern ground
surface. No cultural materials were observed in any of the six shovel tests excavated on the site,
though it is likely that some artifacts have been incorporated within the active plowzone.
Observed Cultural Features
No intact cultural features or indirect evidence of cultural features, such as burned rocks
from possible hearth features, were observed on site 41GU194.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on the site include one chert core, five secondary flakes, three
tertiary flakes, and several tested chert cobbles (Figure 6-20). No temporally diagnostic artifacts
or evidence of preserved floral or faunal remains was observed on the site.

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GU194 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts on the
crest and south-facing slopes of an upland ridge that overlooks an unnamed, intermittent tributary
of the Guadalupe River to the south. Cultural materials observed on the site include a core,
several secondary and tertiary flakes, and several tested cobbles. No temporally diagnostic
cultural materials, evidence of cultural features, or preserved floral or faunal remains were
observed. Natural chert cobbles are abundant on the site and in the surrounding area, suggesting
that the site likely functioned as a lithic raw material procurement locality (i.e., “quarry”).
Site 41GU194 appears to have been heavily disturbed by plowing and ongoing erosion,
and cultural materials on the site appear to be largely or entirely surficial. In addition, an overhead
transmission line and a subsurface water line pass northwest to southeast along the northeastern
boundary of the documented site area. Archeological deposits on site 41GU194 are in poor
condition and possess minimal research potential. While the site may extend outside the
boundaries of the current project area to the northeast and southwest, Horizon recommends that
the portion of the site within the current project area is noncontributing to the overall eligibility of
the site for designation as an SAL. No further investigations are recommended on site 41GU194
in connection with the proposed undertaking.

SITE 41GU195
General Description

Site 41GU195 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts on the
crest and north-facing slopes of an upland ridge that overlooks an unnamed, intermittent tributary
of the Guadalupe River to the north (Figure 6-21; also see Figure 6-2). Cultural materials
observed on the site include a core, a crude biface, several flakes, and several tested chert
cobbles. Two small dart point fragments were also observed, including one barbed, expandingstem point reminiscent of various Late Archaic styles (such as Ensor or Edgewood) and one small,
bifurcated-stem, lanceolate point reminiscent of a Late PaleoIndian style (such as Plainview or
Meserve). Natural chert cobbles are abundant on the site and in the surrounding area, suggesting
that the site likely functioned as a lithic raw material procurement locality (i.e., “quarry”) (Figure 622). The northwestern portion of the site was situated within a planted corn field at the time of
the survey, while the rest of the site was characterized by a fallow agricultural field covered with
dense, short grasses and weeds (Figure 6-23). Ground surface visibility ranged between 20%
and 100%. Elevations on the site range from approximately 180.2 to 192.4 meters (591.0 to
628.0 feet) amsl, sloping down moderately strongly to the north toward the unnamed tributary of
Santa Clara Creek.
Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural resources observed on the modern ground surface, site
41GU195 measures approximately 310.0 meters (1,016.8 feet) northwest to southeast by
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) northeast to southwest within the current project area. Site boundaries
were delineated only within the linear proposed water supply pipeline ROW, and the site may
extend farther to the northeast and southwest outside the current project area.
Cultural materials on site 41GU195 appear to be constrained to the modern ground
surface. No cultural materials were observed in any of the six shovel tests excavated on the site,
though it is likely that some artifacts have been incorporated within the active plowzone.
Observed Cultural Features
No intact cultural features or indirect evidence of cultural features, such as burned rocks
from possible hearth features, were observed on site 41GU195.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GU195 include a core, a crude biface, several
flakes, and several tested chert cobbles (Figure 6-24). Two small dart point fragments were also
observed (Figure 6-25). While neither specimen is clearly associated with known projectile point
types, certain characteristics allow them to be broadly aligned with known time periods. One
specimen consists of a small, barbed, corner-notched, expanding-stem point reminiscent of
various Late Archaic styles (such as Ensor or Edgewood) (see Figure 6-25, right). This point was
manufactured from a mottled white and medium gray, medium-grained chert that does not appear
to have been heat-treated. The other specimen is a small, bifurcated-stem, lanceolate point. A

single small flake has been removed from both facets of the concave base of the point. While
these basal-thinning flake scars are not sufficiently pronounced to clearly identify them as fluting
flakes, the overall morphology of the point is broadly reminiscent of Late PaleoIndian styles (such
as Plainview or Meserve) (see Figure 6-25, left). This point was manufactured from a fine-grained
brown chert. The tool evinces numerous heat spalling scars and appears to have been burned.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GU195 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts on the
crest and north-facing slopes of an upland ridge that overlooks an unnamed, intermittent tributary
of the Guadalupe River to the north. Cultural materials observed on the site include a core, a

6.7

SITE 41GU196
General Description

Site 41GU196 consists of a single mid- to late 20th-century structural feature situated in
an upland grassy cattle pasture or fallow agricultural field at the northern end of an ephemeral
field road that provides access to the location from County Road (CR) 432 (a.k.a. Cowey Road)
to the south (Figure 6-26; also see Figure 6-1). This structure is located in the northeastern corner
of the proposed water treatment plant site and represents the only cultural resource documented
during the survey of the proposed water well field portion of the overall project area. The structure
consists of a 250-barrel, metal oil tank that has been modified for use as an agricultural storage
building (Figures 6-27 to 6-28). No other cultural materials are present on the site. The site is
situated at an elevation of 162.2 meters (532.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
Site 41GU196 consists only of a single cultural feature, a repurposed 250-barrel oil tank.
The site boundaries were arbitrarily drawn to encompass a somewhat larger area measuring
approximately 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) north to south by 25.0 meters (82.0 feet) east to west.

However, as no associated scatter of cultural materials or other cultural features were observed,
the site actually consists only of the single historic-age feature.
Six shovel tests were excavated in the area surrounding the historic-age structure, none
of which yielded any evidence of subsurface archeological deposits.
Observed Cultural Features
The site consists of a single cultural feature. This feature is a bolted, 250-barrel oil tank
that has been modified for agricultural storage purposes. Based on the bolts holding it together,
it was originally built in the mid-20th century (ca. 1940 -1945). The tank is 2.4 meters (8.0 feet)
tall, 4.9 meters (16.0 feet) in diameter, and 15.2 meters (50.0 feet) in circumference. The metal
side sheets, or staves, are 2.4 meters (8.0 feet) tall by 1.5 meters (5.0 feet) wide, and a 250-barrel
tank would be composed of 10 of these staves. The pie-shaped deck pieces came into general
use in the 1940s and are still the standard today. In a 250-barrel tank, there are 10 of these pieshaped decking plates that measure 1.5 meters (5.0 feet) in width at the outer edge and 0.3 meter
(1.0 foot) in width at the small end in the center. The decking pieces measure approximately
2.1 meters (7.0 feet) in length. The small end fits on a central ring that measures roughly
0.6 meter (2.0 feet) in diameter. Concrete has been poured inside of the tank on site 41GU196,
presumably to create a sealed floor, thereby covering up the original steel floor.
Within the past several decades, a host of these tanks have been taken out of oil field
service and moved to farms across the region, where they have been repurposed for storage
purposes. The tank was probably originally built ca. 1940-1945 based on the bolts used, moved
to its current location in recent decades after being taken out of oilfield service, and modified for
use for agricultural storage purposes. An access door has been cut into the side of the structure
that would not have been an original element of its construction.
The 1987 USGS map displays a windmill icon at the location of the repurposed oil tank,
so it is likely that the tank had been retired from oilfield service and moved to its current location
by that time. Earlier maps and aerial photographs do not depict anything at this location, and it is
unknown exactly when the structure was moved to its current location. The structure is in poor
condition and does not appear to be currently in use.
Observed Cultural Materials
No cultural materials were observed on the modern ground surface or in subsurface
contexts in any of the shovel tests excavated on the site.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GU196 consists of a single mid- to late 20th-century structural feature situated in
an upland grassy cattle pasture or fallow agricultural field. The structure consists of a 250-barrel,
metal oil tank that has been modified for agricultural storage. The tank was probably originally
built ca. 1940-1945, moved to its current location in recent decades after being taken out of oilfield
service, and modified for agricultural storage purposes. The 1987 USGS topographic map shows
a windmill at the approximate location of this structure, so it probably has been present at this

location since at least 1987, though there currently is no evidence of a windmill or other
superstructure that may have been mounted on or attached to the structure. Earlier maps and
aerial photographs do not depict anything at this location, so it likely was moved to its current
location in the late 20th century. There is no associated scatter of historic-age artifacts or other
cultural features surrounding the structure, and the structure does not currently appear to be in
use.
While site 41GU196 is broadly indicative of 20th-century farming and ranching practices,
the structure is in poor condition. The structure is an example of a prefabricated metal oil tank
that does not possess any architectural characteristics that warrant an evaluation of historical
significance. Site 41GU196 lacks archeological deposits and has minimal research potential.
Horizon recommends that site 41GU196 is ineligible for designation as an SAL. No further
investigations are recommended on site 41GU196 in connection with the proposed undertaking.

6.8

SITE 41GU197
General Description

Site 41GU197 represents a portion of the remnants of a mid-20th-century farmstead
located adjacent to the northern (high) bank of Cibolo Creek (Figure 6-29; also see Figure 6-2).
The farmstead appears to have been abandoned for some time, but historically likely would have
been accessed via a private road extending southwestward along the property boundary from
FM 78 to the northeast. Extant cultural features on the site include a large, two-story, wood-frame
barn clad in corrugated sheet metal; a concrete livestock watering trough; a small, wood-frame
workshop or chicken coop; two small, collapsing wooden sheds; and a poured concrete slab that
probably represents the former location of a small house, though the house has been demolished
or moved. Two dumps of mixed historic-age and modern glass bottles and aluminum cans are
present in small erosional gullies that drain southwestward toward Cibolo Creek. Of the extant
features on the site, only the large, two-story barn and one of the can and bottle dumps are located
within the current survey area. The concrete livestock watering trough is located southwest of
the project area, and the remaining features are located about 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) northeast
of the project area; as such, the latter features were only cursorily examined during the survey.
The investigated portion of site 41GU197 is situated on a clayey alluvial terrace on the northern
bank of Cibolo Creek within a densely overgrown forested area that lines the creek bank.
Elevations within the investigated portion of the site are relatively flat, ranging only from
approximately 214.6 to 215.2 meters (704.0 to 706.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and historic-age debris, site 41GU197 measures
approximately 75.0 meters (246.0 feet) northwest to southeast by 30.5 meters (100.0 feet)
northeast to southwest within the current project area. Of the extant cultural features observed
on the site, only a large, two-story, wood frame barn and one of the two dumps of mixed historicage glass bottles and aluminum cans fall within the boundaries of the survey area, as mentioned
above. A concrete livestock water trough is present a few meters southwest of the southwestern
survey area boundary. The remaining features, including a small, wood-frame workshop or

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

chicken coop; two small, collapsing wooden sheds; and a small concrete slab that probably
represents the former location of the primary residential structure, are located in an overgrown
wooded area approximately 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) northeast of the survey area. However, no
attempt was made to delineate site boundaries beyond the current project area. The large barn
that falls within the boundaries of the survey area appears to have been a remote outbuilding and
was not part of the main farmstead complex to the northeast.
Aside from the remains of several cultural features, cultural materials on site 41GU197
are limited to two dumps of glass bottles and aluminum cans present in erosional gullies. A
general surface scatter of cultural materials was not observed, though visibility of the modern
ground surface was generally poor due to the dense vegetation. Seven shovel tests were
excavated on the site, none which contained any cultural materials in subsurface contexts.
Observed Cultural Features
One cultural feature associated with site 41GU197 is present within the current project
area. This feature is a large, two-story, wood frame barn clad in corrugated metal siding
(Figures 6-30 to 6-35). The metal roof extends past the walls on wooden frames, forming simple
overhanging eves. The barn rests on a pier-and-beam foundation, and the southern portion of
the barn extends past the first-floor footprint, forming an overhanging bay supported by wooden
beams. The interior floor of the overhanging section of the second floor has collapsed. Much of
the wooden frame appears to be relatively recent, and the barn would appear to have been
constructed no earlier than the mid-century. The barn is roughly square in floorplan, measuring
approximately 9.1 meters (30.0 feet) square. The barn is in a partial state of collapse and is listing
strongly to one side.
The remaining features, including a concrete livestock watering trough; a small, woodframe workshop or chicken coop; two small, collapsing wooden sheds; and a poured concrete
slab that probably represents the former location of a small house (though the house has been
demolished or moved) are located outside the boundaries of the survey corridor and were only
briefly examined.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials on site 41GU197 are limited to two dumps of glass bottles and aluminum
cans present in erosional gullies. One of these two dumps falls within the boundaries of the
project area and is located approximately 10.0 meters (32.8 feet) east of the barn (Figures 6-36
to 6-37). The majority of cultural materials in these dumps appears to be essentially modern,
though a few machine-made glass jars potentially date as early as the mid-20th century.
Historical Research
The property on which site 41GU196 is situated (Property ID 60587) extends from FM 78
on the northeast to Cibolo Creek on the southeast (GCAD 2017). There are no improvements
listed on the parcel. The property appears to have passed through the hands of several holding
companies within the past several decades, though the owners of the parcel at the time of the
likely mid-20th century occupation are not listed.

The large, two-story barn is visible on historical aerial photographs from 1955 onwards,
though earlier images were not available (NETR 2017). The barn is visible on historical USGS
topographic maps from 1961 onwards, though it is not visible on the 1927 map. The main
farmstead, indicated by the structures that fall outside of the current project area to the northeast,
are clearly visible on historical aerial photographs dating to 1955 and 1975, and it would appear
that the farm was still in use at that time. By 1985, historic aerial photographs show that the main
farmstead complex to the northeast and the surrounding fields were beginning to become
overgrown, a pattern that intensifies on subsequent images; as such, it would appear that the
farmstead was abandoned between 1975 and 1985.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GU197 represents a portion of the remnants of a mid-20th-century farmstead
located adjacent to the northern (high) bank of Cibolo Creek. The farmstead appears to have
been occupied in the mid- to late 20th century, and it appears to have been abandoned between
1975 and 1985. Extant cultural features on the site include a large, two-story, wood-frame barn
clad in corrugated sheet metal; a concrete livestock watering trough; a small, wood-frame
workshop or chicken coop; two small, collapsing wooden sheds; and a poured concrete slab that
probably represents the former location of a small house, though the house has been demolished
or moved. Two dumps of mixed historic-age and modern glass bottles and aluminum cans are
present in small erosional gullies that drain southwestward toward Cibolo Creek. Of the extant
features on the site, only the large, two-story barn and one of the can and bottle dumps are located
within the current survey area. The barn is a simple agricultural outbuilding constructed of
dimensional lumber and corrugated sheet metal that appears to have been built no earlier than
the mid-20th century. The can and bottle dump contains primarily modern materials, though a
few machine-made bottles may have been manufactured as early as the mid-20th century. The
remaining features are located well outside the boundaries of the survey area and were only
superficially examined.
While site 41GU197 is broadly indicative of mid-20th-century farming practices, the
majority of the former farmstead is located outside the boundaries of the current survey area. The
single extant standing structure within the project area, a crude wood-frame barn, is in poor
condition and does not possess any distinctive architectural characteristics. The proposed water
supply pipeline would be constructed in an area that falls between the standing barn within the
project area and the other extant features to the northeast, and SSLGC and Walker Partners
intend to avoid any construction-related disturbances to the barn. The primary residence, formerly
located to the northeast of the investigated portion of the site, has been demolished or removed,
and the remaining structures are in various stages of collapse. Site 41GU197 lacks archeological
deposits, has minimal research potential, and is not known to have been associated with any
persons, events, or trends of historical note. While the site extends outside the boundaries of the
current project area to the northeast and southwest, Horizon recommends that the portion of the
site within the current project area is noncontributing to the overall eligibility of the site for
designation as an SAL. No further investigations are recommended on site 41GU197 in
connection with the proposed undertaking.

UNNAMED CEMETERY NEAR HAECKERVILLE

In addition, one cemetery—an unnamed cemetery in Haeckerville—is located partially
within the 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide cultural resources survey corridor, though the cemetery
does not extend within the proposed construction area associated with the current project. As
currently designed, the proposed pipeline centerline would pass 12.2 meters (40.0 feet) to the
southeast of the southeastern cemetery boundary, and the engineer is considering moving the
pipeline another 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) southeast to the other side of Town Creek. As such, a
buffer exceeding the required 7.6-meter (25.0-foot) buffer separates the proposed water supply
pipeline centerline from the fence that marks the southeastern cemetery boundary. The nearest
cluster of headstones is located another 7.6 meters (25.0 feet) northwest of the southeastern
cemetery fenceline, and a second cluster of headstones is present in the northern corner of the
cemetery. The cemetery appears to be relatively modern, which suggests that there is low
potential for unmarked burials. As such, the current project design would avoid any impacts to
the cemetery.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the project area and to make preliminary determinations of whether or
not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important
historic events and/or personages. Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources
are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological
resources for designation as SALs.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

88

Proposed Water System Improvements Project, Guadalupe County, Texas

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

Between January and October 2017, Horizon Project Archeologist Briana N. Smith, with
the assistance of archeological technicians Jacob Lyons, Stephanie Mueller, Jared Wiersema
and under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
cultural resources survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that may be impacted
by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the project area on foot and
thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources.
The majority of the proposed water supply pipeline ROW parallels the utility easement of
an existing SSLGC water line. The proposed water supply pipeline ROW traverses mostly planted
and fallow fields as well as cattle pastures. Visibility of the modern ground surface ranged from
high in agricultural fields (100%) to relatively low in pastures and vegetated areas (<30%). The
pedestrian survey with shovel testing within the proposed water supply pipeline ROW typically
revealed shallow deposits of clay or clay loam overlying clay at depths ranging from 20.0 to
30.0 centimeters (7.9 to 11.8 inches) below surface.
The proposed water well field project area, which is composed of the water treatment
plant, nine water well pads, and water gathering lines, is situated in an area that ranges from
relatively flat, open pastureland to lightly wooded areas. Visibility of the modern ground surface
remained low in most areas due to dense grasses. The pedestrian survey with shovel testing
within the proposed water well field typically revealed moderately deep deposits of sandy and
clayey loam extending to depths of 30.0 to 70.0 centimeters (11.8 to 27.6 inches) overlying sandy
clay, though a few shovel contained loamy sediments to depths of 100.0 centimeters
(39.4 inches) or more below surface.
Six newly recorded archeological sites—41GU191, 41GU192, 41GU193, 41GU194,
41GU195, and 41GU197—and one previously recorded archeological site—41GU67—were

documented within the proposed water supply pipeline ROW during the survey. In addition, one
newly recorded archeological site—41GU196—was documented within the proposed water well
field project area on the proposed water treatment plant site (Table 7-1). Sites 41GU67,
41GU192, 41GU193, 41GU194, and 41GU195 consist of scatters of aboriginal lithic debris in
plowed fields that generally appear to represent lithic raw material procurement areas (i.e.,
“quarries”). Site 41GU191 consists of a scatter of late 19th to mid-20th century domestic debris
in a plowed field. Site 41GU196 consists of a historic-age oil tank originally constructed ca. 19401945 that was subsequently moved to its current location and modified for use as an agricultural
storage building. Site 41GU197 consists of a mid-20th-century barn and a dump of mixed mid20th-century and modern glass bottles and aluminum cans.
All eight archeological sites recorded during the survey are recommended as ineligible for
designation as SALs under the Antiquities Code of Texas based on the poor condition of the sites
and their low potential to contribute meaningfully to an understanding of the historic and/or
prehistoric past. No further investigations are warranted on these sites in connection with the
proposed undertaking.

In addition, one cemetery—an unnamed cemetery in Haeckerville—is located partially
within the 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide cultural resources survey corridor, though the cemetery
does not extend within the proposed construction area associated with the current project. As
currently designed, the proposed pipeline centerline would pass 12.2 meters (40.0 feet) to the
southeast of the southeastern cemetery boundary, and the engineer is considering moving the
pipeline another 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) southeast to the other side of Town Creek. As such, a
buffer exceeding the required 7.6-meter (25.0-foot) buffer separates the proposed water supply
pipeline centerline from the fence that marks the southeastern cemetery boundary. The nearest
cluster of headstones is located another 7.6 meters (25.0 feet) northwest of the southeastern
cemetery fenceline, and a second cluster of headstones is present in the northern corner of the
cemetery. The cemetery appears to be relatively modern, which suggests that there is low
potential for unmarked burials. As such, the current project design would avoid any impacts to
the cemetery.

7.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no
historic properties affected,” and no further archeological work is recommended in connection
with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are
protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or
burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and the THC should be notified
immediately.
