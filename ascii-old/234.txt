DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area consists of five high probability areas where the water
transmission line will be placed in close proximity to resacas in Cameron County
(Figure 1). The water transmission line will be placed within the rights-of-way of
Farm-to-Market Road 800, Gamble Road, Long Road, Robert Road, and a
private ranch road. The pipe is twelve inches in diameter and will be placed in a
trench two feet wide and four feet deep. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is
within the highway right-of-way, approximately 10 feet in width. The five areas
investigated are viewed as high probability areas for the presence of a prehistoric
site because of their proximity to resacas, a setting where significant sites have
been documented in the general area. The project area is depicted on three
USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangles. They are Santa Maria (2697-221) (Figure 2),
La Paloma (2697-212), and Olmito (2697-211) (Figure 3).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the five high probability areas. The client is the Military
Highway WSC. BVRA was retained by the client to perform the archaeological
survey per the request of the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The Principal
Investigator was William E. Moore, and James E. Warren performed the field
survey with the assistance of Arthur Romine and Bobby Jemison. The field
survey was carried out on March 10, 2010 and involved 24 person hours.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Atlas were
checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites and projects
in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work
in Cameron County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of
prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. Some of the major works utilized
are reports by Maslyk et al. (1999), Kibler (2002), and Griffith et al. (2005). The
project area was investigated by a 100% Pedestrian Survey and two backhoe
trenches at each of the five high probability areas. The backhoe trenches were dug
to the depth of the APE, and samples of the excavated earth were screened. The
project was documented through field notes and backhoe trench profiles (see
Appendix I). Specific information regarding the ten backhoe trenches appears
below.
Backhoe Trench 1
This trench was excavated on the south side of Farm-to Market Road 800 in
the vicinity of Resaca de los Fresnos (Area 1) and on the west bank of the resaca.
It was 5 meters long and 60 centimeters wide and dug to a depth of 1.3 meters.
The trench was excavated in arbitrary levels of 30 centimeters, and samples of
earth (20 shovels full) were screened using ¼ inch hardware cloth. The soil in this
trench consisted of clay loam (10YR 4/4) to a depth of 60 centimeters and clay
(10YR 4/5) from 60 centimeters to the bottom of the trench. The location of this
trench is depicted in Figure 2 (Area 1).
Backhoe Trench 2
This trench was excavated on the south side of Farm-to Market Road 800 in
the vicinity of Resaca de los Fresnos and on the east bank of the resaca. It was 5
meters long and 60 centimeters wide and dug to a depth of 1.2 meters. The trench
was excavated in arbitrary levels of 30 centimeters, and samples of earth (20
shovels full) were screened using ¼ inch hardware cloth. The soil in this trench
consisted of clay loam (10YR 4/4) to a depth of 50 centimeters and clay (10YR 4/5)
from 50 centimeters to the bottom of the trench. The location of this trench is
depicted in Figure 2 (Area 1).

crosses Resaca del Rancho Viejo and on the southwest bank of the resaca. It was
5 meters long and 60 centimeters wide and dug to a depth of 1.25 meters. The
trench was excavated in arbitrary levels of 30 centimeters, and samples of earth
(20 shovels full) were screened using ¼ inch hardware cloth. The soil in this trench
was clay loam (10YR 4/2) to a depth of 50 centimeters and clay (10YR 5/3) from 50
centimeters to the bottom of the trench. The location of this trench is depicted in
Figure 3 (Area 2).
Backhoe Trench 4
This trench was excavated on the northwest side of Gamble Road where it
crosses Resaca del Rancho Viejo and on the northeast bank of the resaca. It was
5 meters long and 60 centimeters wide and dug to a depth of 90 centimeters. The
trench was excavated in arbitrary levels of 30 centimeters, and samples of earth
(20 shovels full) were screened using ¼ inch hardware cloth. The soil in this trench
consisted of clay (10YR 3/1) over standing water at the bottom of the trench. The
location of this trench is depicted in Figure 3 (Area 2).

RESULTS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
sites have been recorded in the project area, and a professional archaeologist had
not previously examined the tract. No archaeological sites were found during the
course of this survey. The APE is in the rights-of-way of roads. According to a
survey by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. in 1999 (Maslyk, et al. 1999:iv), these settings
lack “contextual integrity.” Overall, the areas investigated contained soils described
as clay loam, clay, and sandy loam at the surface over clay and loamy clay. The
soils were homogeneous except for Backhoe Trench 7 where calcium carbonate
nodules were present between 40 and 120 centimeters. Most of the ground
surface area near the resacas has been disturbed through root plowing and other
agricultural practices such as plowing. The original surface at most of the backhoe
trench locations has been removed by excavation of borrow ditches that occurred
when the roads were constructed.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
survey. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the
excavation of the trench at any of the five areas investigated, all work must stop
until the THC can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance
with the Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the THC.
