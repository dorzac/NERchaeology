ABSTRACT
A Phase I cultural resources survey of a 13 square mile area (8320 acres) within
the Sam Houston National Forest in southern San Jacinto County, Texas was conducted
by Dixie Environmental Services Company (DESCO) under the direction of Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA). The project commenced on August 27, 2007 and ended on
November 29, 2007 upon completion of source point and access route offsets. There are
125 compartments in the Sam Houston National Forest, and this seismic survey included
portions of nine compartments. They are 112 through 114 and 119 through 124. The
subsurface was examined through shovel testing at pre-determined source points.
Three previously recorded prehistoric sites are located within the project area.
They are 41SJ38, 41SJ50, and 41SJ54. These sites were marked in the field and will
be avoided by the drillers. This survey identified and recorded thirteen previously
unrecorded prehistoric sites (41SJ194 - 41SJ206). Six of these sites date to the Late
Prehistoric period of Texas prehistory based on the presence of ceramics and arrow
points. One site and one isolated find are believed to date to the Archaic period of
Texas prehistory based on the presence of dart point fragments. No diagnostic artifacts
were found at five sites, and they are listed in this report as “Unknown Prehistoric.”
There is not enough data to determine the eligibility of the thirteen newly recorded sites.
In addition to the thirteen newly recorded sites, five areas contained two artifacts or
less, and they are described in this report as isolated finds.
All artifacts and records have been prepared for curation according to the
guidelines established by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), and they
have been submitted to the United States Forest Service in Lufkin, Texas where they will
be curated.

INTRODUCTION
New Century Exploration, Inc. proposes to conduct a 64.34 square mile 3-D
seismic survey project in southern San Jacinto County in the spring and summer of
2008 (Figure 1). The purpose of this survey was to provide a high-resolution image of
the subsurface geological features that will allow the client to effectively evaluate the
hydrocarbon reserves underlying the project area. Appendix I describes the methods to
be used by the surveyors and drillers. The Casino 3-D project area encompasses
approximately 13 square miles of the Sam Houston National Forest (Figure 2) within
compartments 112, 113, 114, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, and 124. Figures 3-6 are a
series of 8.5” x 11” topographic maps that depict the areas surveyed. The administrative
office of the Sam Houston National Forest is located in New Waverly (Walker County),
Texas. The overall supervision of the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas is
administered from the Forest Supervisor’s Office in Lufkin (Angelina County), Texas.
The major transportation routes that pass through the current project area are three
Farm-to-Market (F.M) roads (F.M. 945, F.M. 1725, and F.M. 2025). In addition, there are
numerous forest service roads created and maintained by the United States Forest
Service. The project area is depicted on four 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangles.
They are Bear Creek (3095-143), Cleveland (3095-141), Fostoria (3095-142), and
Wescott (3095-144).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coast Plain physiographic
province and the Austropriarian biotic province as defined by Blair (1950:98-100). The
western boundary of this province is delineated by an imaginary line running from Harris
County northward to the Red River in western Red River County. This imaginary line
also marks the boundary of the great southern pine forests, which extend eastward to
the Atlantic Coast. East Texas is divided by Tharp (1939) into the long-leaf pine region
and the pine-oak forests. He (Tharp 1939) refers to the pine forest association as a
climax vegetation with long-leaf pine (Pinus palustris) as the dominant species. He
describes the area as being a pine savannah with little or no understory shrubs and few
of the other species of pine present. According to Ippolito (1983:6), much of the land in
East Texas had been severely forested when Tharp wrote his opinion. The climax
stands of pine were restricted to the upland areas beyond the second terraces. The
riverine areas were dominated by an oak-hickory association and other hardwoods such
as magnolia, sweet gum, and beech. Ippolito (1983:6) states that it “is possible, but
difficult to prove, that some climax stands still remain in both the upland and riverine
associations.” In a later study by John E. Keller, four major plant communities for East
Texas were identified, and these apply to the Sam Houston National Forest as well.
They are aquatic areas, bottomlands, terraces, and uplands. According to Ippolito
(1983:6), “the probability of the existence of climax associations within these
communities is good.” The surface geology is the Willis Formation, which consists of
various sands and clays containing some small gravels. The reader is referred to
Volume I (Stratigraphy) of the Geology of Texas by Sellards et al. (1932) for a more indepth discussion of the geology of this area. The major drainage in this part of the Sam
Houston National Forest is the East Fork of the San Jacinto River, which runs north south
through the approximate center of the project area. It is joined from the west by Winters
Bayou that flows from the northeast to the southeast before turning due east where it
intersects with the river. Other smaller streams in the area are Whiskey Branch,
Jayhawker Creek, and Blue Branch. According to the General Soil Map in the soil survey
for Polk and San Jacinto counties (McEwen et al. 1988), there are two general soil types in
the project area. These are soils on uplands that are moderately well drained to poorly
drained loamy, clayey, and sandy soils and soils on floodplains that are moderately well
drained to poorly drained loamy, clayey, sandy, and silty soils. Two photos illustrate the
wooded nature of the project area. They are a view of a high bank of the East Fork of the
San Jacinto River (Figure 7), and a general view of the wooded conditions found in the
project area (Figure 8). A different view of the East Fork of the San Jacinto River appears
on the cover of this report.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
General
According to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning Region of
Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), San Jacinto County is situated within
the Southeast Texas Archeological Study Region. Biesaart et al. (1985:76) place this
county in the Southeast Texas cultural-geographical region in a statistical overview
published by the Texas Historical Commission. This is an area well documented in
terms of numbers of sites when compared to other regions in Texas. When the
statistical overview was published in 1985, a total of 1630 sites (8.06 percent of the
state) were recorded in the entire region. Only four of the thirteen regions reported
more sites or had a higher percentage statewide. In terms of county statistics; however,
San Jacinto County was third in the region in 1985 with 132 recorded prehistoric sites
(Biesaart et al. 1985:88). In 1985, known sites in San Jacinto County dated to the
following temporal periods: Paleo-Indian (n=1), Early Archaic (n=2), Late Archaic (n=8),
General Archaic (n=14), and Late Prehistoric (n=114). The 1985 statistical overview
describes site disturbance as consisting of erosion, construction, and vandalism. In all,
3 sites had been excavated in 1985, 10 had been tested by hand, 2 had been tested by
machine, and 118 had been surface collected. The statistical overview does not
mention site numbers; therefore, the above data provide only a general picture of the
condition of sites in San Jacinto County in 1985. According to the planning document
for the Eastern Planning Region of Texas by the Texas Historical Commission
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.3), site density in 1993 was 0.001 to 0.1 sites
per square mile. The authors list the threats to archeological resources in the county as
reservoir construction, oil and gas production, and the timber industry.
Based on previous work in the general area, prehistoric sites are most likely
found on sandy ridges and knolls adjacent to streams, sloughs, and springs that
contained water in the prehistoric past. Prehistoric sites may also be found in the
floodplains of streams on low rises or mounds. Isolated finds or small concentrations of
prehistoric artifacts may be found throughout the area. Although rock art is scarce in
East Texas, one recorded example is the Gibson Petroglyph site (41TN12) located on
the rear wall of a sandstone overhang in nearby Trinity County.
Sam Houston National Forest
Based on a list provided by Walter D. Kingsborough and background research
performed by the Principal Investigator, there are 211 archaeological sites in the Sam
Houston Forest on lands owned by the United States Forest Service. Of this number,
172 sites are prehistoric (Appendix II), and 39 sites are historic (Appendix III). Nine of
the sites have prehistoric and historic components. Three of the prehistoric sites may
have been recorded on the basis of non-cultural materials.

10

The vast majority of the prehistoric sites in the forest (n=121) are defined as
lithic scatters, sites where only lithic artifacts were found. Another 29 sites are
described as lithic/ceramic scatters. The terms lithic scatter and lithic/ceramic scatter
are somewhat misleading in that lithics and ceramics were not found scattered across
the surface at these sites. Rather, they were found during shovel testing. Unless a
specific function can be ascertained, BVRA prefers to refer to these sites as “unknown
Prehistoric.” In this report, however, the Forest Service terms are used.
Thirteen sites are defined as camps, 3 are lithic procurement sites, and 6 are
unknown prehistoric. There is one isolated find where a single Archaic point was found
on the surface in Compartment 120. The 172 prehistoric sites are present in all three
counties in the Sam Houston National Forest (Montgomery, San Jacinto, and Walker).
Those sites described as lithic/ceramic scatters date to the Late Prehistoric period
based on the presence of ceramics. Excavations at three sites in the forest (41WA104,
41WA218, and 99-SH-027-1) have been conducted. These excavations are discussed
in the Previous Investigations section below. No sites with burials have been reported
in the Sam Houston National Forest.
Most of the sites in the Sam Houston National Forest (n=133) did not produce
diagnostic artifacts; therefore the age of these sites is not known. The earliest sites
date to the Archaic Stage. They are 41MQ41, 41MQ58, 41WA139, and 41WA218.
When the lithic/ceramic scatters are combined with other sites producing pottery or
arrow points, the total number of Late Prehistoric sites is 37. One site (41SJ136) is
believed to date to the proto-Historic period and may be associated with occupation of
the area by the Alabama-Coushatta (Sam Houston National Forest files). Not one of
the prehistoric sites in the Sam Houston National Forest is listed in the National
Register of Historic Places or has been designated as a State Archeological Landmark.
Historic sites are not always tied to water and may be present anywhere on the
landscape. Evidence of logging activities in the project area is visible in the form of
trams that are scattered across the landscape. The 39 recorded historic sites in the
Sam Houston National Forest date from the late 19th century through the late 20th
century. They include homesteads (n=14), farmsteads (n=2), tenant farms (n=6),
cemeteries (n=3), CCC camps (n=3), trash scatters (n=3), trash dumps (n=1), logging
camps (n=1), cabins (n=1), wells (n=1), bridges (n=1), stone lined pits (n=1), military
sites (n=1), and unknown historic (n=6). Eight sites date to the 19th century, 19 sites
date to the 20th century, and 6 date to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Not one of
the historic sites in the Sam Houston National Forest is listed in the National Register of
Historic Places or has been designated as a State Archeological Landmark

Project Area
There are only three previously recorded sites within the current project area,
and all are prehistoric. Site 41SJ38 is located in Compartment 120 and is described on
the site form as a lithic/ceramic scatter. Site 41SJ50 is located in Compartment 113
and is described on the site form as a lithic/ceramic scatter. Site 41SJ54 is located in
compartment 120 and is described on the site form as a lithic scatter. There is a
reference to a cabin in Compartment 120 on one of the forest service maps, but this has
not been confirmed (Walter D. Kingsborough, personal communication). There are no
communities or towns in the project area, but the remains of farmsteads and evidence
of past logging activities may occur. Also, no cemeteries are known to be present in the
project area.
No sites in the current project area are listed in the National Register of Historic
Places, and no sites have been designated as a State Archeological Landmark.

CULTURE SEQUENCE
The current project area is located in the Southeast Texas cultural region as
defined by Biesaart et al. (1985), Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), and Ricklis (2004)
(Figure 9). The area referred to by archaeologists as Southeast Texas was occupied by
non-agricultural native populations from Paleo-Indian times through the period of Early
European contact (Ricklis 2004:181). Detailed summaries of Southeast Texas prehistory
have been prepared by various researchers with the most notable examples being the
works by Lawrence E. Aten (1983), Dee Ann Story, et al. (1990), and Robert A. Ricklis
(2004). An overview of the National Forests in Texas was prepared by John Ippolito
(1983), and this document was a major source of information in the writing of this report. It
is generally accepted by most archaeologists that Southeast Texas prehistory is divided
into three basic prehistoric periods or stages: Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric.
Some archaeologists (Kotter 1981) believe that there was a Formative Period that existed
prior to Historic contact.
Paleo-Indian Stage
This is the earliest generally accepted cultural period of the Americas, and it
represents the initial settlement and habitation of prehistoric human populations across
much of the North American continent following the end of the Pleistocene. The common
conception of the Paleo-Indian period is the time following the last ice age in North
America when man wandered about the continent in pursuit of megafauna such as
mammoth, mastodon, and now-extinct species of bison. Although not much is known
about their diet, plants and other smaller animals probably were as important to the PaleoIndians as an occasional mammoth or other large animals.
Paleo-Indians are noted for the manufacture of unique and distinctive projectile
points such as Clovis and Folsom. Other types found at early sites include Angostura,
Plainview, Meserve, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff. Descriptions of these and other types
associated with Paleo-Indians are described in Turner and Hester (1985) and Suhm and
Jelks (1962). In Southeast Texas, most of the Paleo-Indian projectile points have been
found as isolated surface finds, often in a disturbed context. An unidentifiable PaleoIndian point was found on the surface at 41WA100 within the general boundaries of the
Sam Houston National Forest (Moore 1990). Sites with in situ deposits dating to this period
are few in number in Southeast Texas. Ippolito (1983:13) states that an association with
these early points and megafuna is lacking and that “there is no recorded evidence
establishing these artifacts in a firm archaeological context anywhere in the region.” This
statement is also confirmed by Robert Ricklis (2004:184) who states, “Archeological
excavation of a Paleo-Indian site has yet to be undertaken in Southeast Texas.”

Figure 9. Southeast Texas Cultural Area

14

There are differing views as to when Paleo-Indians occupied Southeast Texas. A
chronology by Story et al. (1990) for the coastal margin and inland areas of Southeast
Texas places “Early Cultures” as occurring between 9500 B.C. and 7000 B.C.; Ippolito
(1983) dates the Paleo-Indian Stage from sometime prior to 10,000 B.C. and ending about
6000 B.C.; and Ricklis (2004) dates this same period as beginning circa 11,500 B.P. and
ending in 8000 B.P. Sites of this period are probably found on the older landforms
overlooking major streams and rivers, as the lower terraces are too recent in age.
Based on a model for the southeastern United States (Anderson 1996), it is likely
that early Paleo-Indian groups migrated south following major waterways before moving to
other areas as populations increased. The early Paleo-Indian groups relied in part on
now-extinct species of Pleistocene megafauna in addition to native plants (Willey
1966:37). Environmental and climatic changes resulted in the widespread extinction of
over thirty-five species of megafauna such as mammoth, mastodon, bison, and the giant
ground sloth. Steponaitis (1996) believes that a shift to a heavier reliance on smaller
game, as well as floral resources, may have occurred as a result of the decline of the
subsistence base provided by the megafauna resources. According to Ippolito (1983:13),
“A Paleo-Indian Stage, in the classical sense of the ‘Big-Game Hunting Tradition,’ probably
did not exist in east Texas.”
Research by Bryant and Shafer (1977) provides a strong argument for the lack of
Paleo-Indian association with local megafauna. Their research indicates that much of
East Texas during the Early Holocene (10,000 B.P. – 6000 B.P.) was primarily a woodland
region with scattered parklands. This environment would have been more conducive to
browsing species such as deer than to grazing animals such as bison. The assumption is
that Paleo-Indian groups interested in pursuing and exploiting megafauna would have
occupied other regions of the state where these animals were present. To date, there are
no known sites that can be attributed to Paleo-Indian occupation in San Jacinto County.
Archaic Stage
This stage is generally defined as that interval between the Paleo-Indian Stage and
the introduction of ceramics, horticulture, and the bow and arrow. Ricklis (2004:184) dates
the Archaic Stage from 8000 B.P. to 1500 B.P. This time period corresponds to Shafer’s
Lithic Period (6000 B.C. – 200 B.C.). During this time, small bands of hunters and
gatherers roamed the countryside in search of plants and animals. According to Ambler
(1970:5), the term Archaic was used to refer to the pre-ceramic components found at
several sites in the Wallisville Reservoir area, but sites containing Archaic materials at
Wallisville Reservoir were few in number. In the Wallisville area, evidence of human
occupation before 5000 years ago is not expected to be present because the modern delta
began forming after this time (Aten 1967). Numerous sites with Archaic components have
been found in Southeast Texas. Often, these sites are mixed with post-Archaic remains.
The main indicator of an Archaic site is the presence of diagnostic projectile points. Sites
cannot be classified as Archaic simply on the basis of an absence of ceramics.

15

Any ceramics that were present on the surface could have been taken from the site
by collectors, and subsurface testing is needed to recover temporally diagnostic artifacts.
The presence of dart points at shell middens, especially the Kent type, is an indicator of an
Archaic occupation. The Archaic Stage is divided into three periods, Early, Middle, and
Late. Ricklis (2004:185) states that it is difficult to draw inferences about adaptive patterns
beyond the assumption of some mix of hunting-and-gathering practices in Southeast
Texas because inland Archaic sites contain a dearth of faunal and macro-botanical
remains.
The Early Archaic is viewed by Kotter (1981) as a period of transition from the biggame hunting traditions of Paleo-Indians to a broader based economy. He believes that
groups of people were utilizing Paleo-Indian technology while practicing an Archaic
economy during the early stages of this period. According to Lawrence E. Aten
(1983:160), there was a continuation of a generalized technology and the minimum band
level of social organization established by the previous Paleo-Indian culture. Subsistence
probably relied on hunting and gathering with the exploitation of marine resources now
established as a viable food source. Only one Archaic shell midden in Southeast Texas
has been reported. This is the McKinzie site (41NU221) in Nueces County. Ricklis
(1988:65), based on his recent studies of fish otoliths, hypothesized a seasonal round
exploitative system with littoral sites occupied in the winter months had become
established by the Early Archaic period.
According to Ensor et al. (1991:8), the Early Archaic lasted for 3000 years from
8000 B.C. to 5000 B.C. and is characterized by point types Angostura, Plainview,
Golondrina, and San Patrice as well as early side-notched and corner-notched forms.
Sites of this period are also rare. It is possible, however, that Early Archaic sites may be
present on upland terraces adjacent to major streams such as the Trinity River. One of
the few sites in Southeast Texas that has been dated to this period is Scotts Ridge
(41MQ41). It was excavated by archaeologists from Texas A&M University (Shafer and
Stearns 1975) and was defined as an Early Archaic site based on the presence of a San
Patrice point, a corner-notched point, a side-notched point, and an absence of ceramics.
This site is located on an upland ridge where early sites were expected to be present.
According to Shafer and Stearns (1975:37), “The archeological findings at the Scott’s
Ridge site are very significant in that they confirm the hypothesis that prehistoric sites
having considerable antiquity do occur on older landforms in the area.” Previous work in
the area had sampled sites situated low in the valleys on landforms that are geologically
recent, and these sites are more recent in age. Site 41MQ41 is referred to here as an
Early Archaic site, but Shafer and Stearns (1975:8) place it in his Early Lithic Period that
lasted from 8000 B.C. to 4000 B.C.

16

Ambler (1970:4), referring to the Early Archaic, states “Only enough artifacts to
indicate the presence of people in the area (Southeast Texas) have been recovered from
this time level.” A San Patrice point and an Albany Spokeshave were found at 41CH53 in
Chambers County (Tunnell and Ambler 1967). Wheat (1953) found three San Patrice
points in the Addicks Reservoir area, San Patrice points were found in a transitional Paleo­
Indian/Archaic context at the Wolfshead site (41SA117) in San Augustine County (Duffield
1963), and a San Patrice point was found on the surface of 41WA83 in Walker County
(Moore 1983). Early Archaic points are generally sporadic surface finds. Ambler surmises
that there is evidence that there was some utilization of this region soon after the end of
the Pleistocene. Projectile points dating to the Early Archaic period have been found
throughout Southeast Texas, but pure sites dating to this period are rare. The Scott’s
Ridge site (41MQ41), discussed above, is an Early Archaic site within the Sam Houston
National Forest.
The Middle Archaic period appears to be simply a continuation of those adaptive
strategies employed during the Early Archaic discussed above. Kotter (1981:32) believes
that there were no significant changes in the basic exploitative strategies from those noted
in the Early Archaic period. According to Ensor, et al. (1991:8), this period lasted for 4000
years from 5000 B.C. to 1000 B.C. Several point types are considered to be diagnostic of
the period. They are Yarbrough, Trinity, Carrollton, Palmillas, Gary, Kent, and Dawson.
The Middle Archaic corresponds roughly to Shafer’s Middle Lithic Period (4000 B.C. to
1000 B.C.), according to Shafer (Shafer and Stearns 1975:8). In Shafer’s discussion of
this period he states that data on associated materials are almost non-existent, but he
mentions the presence of stone beads at a site on Lake Livingston (James Boyce,
personal communication). The dart point types listed by Shafer (Shafer and Stearns 1975)
as characteristic of the Middle Archaic along the lower Neches and Sabine rivers include
Wells, Morrill, Calf Creek, Yarbrough, Bulverde-like, and Evans. No Middle Archaic sites
have been recorded in the Sam Houston National Forest.
The Late Archaic is marked by changes in subsistence orientation and an increase
in the intensity of influence from other cultural areas. For the first time, there was a
marked exploitation of major river tributaries and other areas away from the mainstream
river channels. Prewitt and Grombacher (1974) believe the use of tributary streams may
be indicative of sporadic or seasonal exploitation and not semi-permanent camps. Dates
for this period vary from 1000 B.C. to A.D. 400 (Ensor et al. 1991:8) to Aten’s (1983:287)
estimate that it persisted from approximately 3500 years B.P. until the introduction of
ceramics. Aten (1983:158) also states that population increased significantly as evidenced
by an increase in the number of sites as well as intra-site artifacts. Trade with Woodland
cultures to the east has been noted by Hall (1981:281-284). The occurrence of shell
middens at Late Archaic sites is not as common as at later sites (Patterson 1979:112).
The projectile point assemblage is characterized by a contracting stem tradition, primarily
the Gary type with continued use of Kent and Dawson points. According to Kotter (1981),
other diagnostic tools include Godley, Woden, Ensor, Refugio, and Edgewood projectile
points; Bristol and Erath bifaces; Bronson knives; and Perkin pikes.

17

According to Ricklis (2004:185), the predominant Late Archaic point types are Gary
with Ensor and Godley in the western reaches of Southeast Texas. Sandy-paste ceramics
associated with Gary points may have been present during the latter part of this period.
Late Archaic sites have been reported in the Sam Houston National Forest.
Late Prehistoric Stage
This stage (also referred to as the Neo-Archaic or Ceramic Period) is marked by the
addition of arrow points and the use of ceramics, and it lasted until European interaction
with aboriginal groups became firmly established. Kotter (1981:33) believes few, if any,
change in subsistence strategies occurred during this time. Shafer states that the lithic
artifacts associated with his Early Ceramic Period (200 B.C. – A.D. 900) are the same as
those of his Late Lithic Period, and the same landforms were occupied. The main
difference is the introduction of sandy-paste pottery. Later, the bow and arrow gradually
replaced the atlatl or spear thrower, and arrow points made their appearance. Some of
the more common types of arrow points are Alba, Catahoula, Friley, and Perdiz.
Later in the period, bone-tempered and grog-tempered pottery became more
frequent, although sandy-paste ceramics continued to be used as utilitarian wares. No
direct evidence of horticulture is known from this region. Ensor et al. (1991:8) separate the
Neo-Archaic into Early and Late Ceramic periods with the Early Ceramic Period dating
from A.D. 400 to A.D. 800 and the Late Ceramic Period dating from A.D. 800 to A.D. 1750.
The Late Prehistoric Stage probably continued to the time of Historic contact. Population
density is assumed to have increased steadily throughout the period until disease and
expansion by Europeans eventually caused the destruction of Late Prehistoric peoples.
Aten (1983) divides the Late Prehistoric into six periods dating from A.D. 100 to A.D. 1810.
The last period is characterized by the presence of European trade goods. Inland sites of
this period tend to be found on uplands overlooking stream valleys or on well-drained
locations within or along floodplains. According to Shafer and Stearns (1975:9), the same
geomorphic landforms were occupied during this period as was occupied during his Lithic
(Archaic) period. Late Prehistoric sites are common in Southeast Texas and have been
recorded within the Sam Houston National Forest.
Historic Indian Period
According to Shafer and Stearns (1975:10), the historic Indian period in Texas is
marked by the introduction of European-made materials into the aboriginal assemblages.
Research by William W. Newcomb (1961) revealed that the main indigenous Indian
groups of eastern and Southeast Texas were the Bidai, Deadose, Patiri, and Akokisa.
These groups were closely related and spoke the Atakapan language. McClurkan
(1968:109) states that these Atakapan speakers formed a separate cultural entity for at
least 4000 years. It is often impossible to link prehistoric sites with historic Indian groups
without the presence of artifacts manufactured during the historic period such as glass
trade beads, gunflints made for trade by Europeans, and metal objects. As a result, Indian
sites known to date to the historic period are rare in Southeast Texas.

18

The first European contact with Indians in the region occurred in 1528 when
members of the Narvaez Expedition found themselves stranded on an island in the Gulf of
Mexico off the Texas coast. From a journal kept by Cabeza de Vaca, a survivor of that
group, we have learned much of what we know about the indigenous peoples of
Southeast Texas. Spanish and French traders were active on the lower Trinity River in the
1740s. A trading camp in what is now Chambers County was established by the French
trader Blaincpain for commerce with the nearby Akokisa village of El Orcoquisac. The
Spanish were fearful of French expansion so they dispatched Lieutenant Marcos Ruiz in
1754 to make a reconnaissance of the lower Trinity River. Ruiz was accompanied by a
band of local Indians. They came upon the French trader Blaincpain arrested him,
destroyed his trading post, and divided his trade goods among the Indian allies. In the
summer of 1776, the Spanish established Presidio San Augustin de Ahumada on the site
where they had discovered and destroyed the French trading post and the established
Mission Nuestra Senora de la Luz as buffers against French encroachment and ostensibly
to convert the Orcoquisa (Akokisa) living in the area to Christianity.
Sites believed to be contemporaneous with the Spanish Colonial occupation along
the Texas coast have been documented in Chambers and Liberty counties. Kathleen
Gilmore (1974) tested a shell mound (41CH110) in Chambers County and recovered a
European glass trade bead and late-style Indian ceramics. This site is part of the
Orocoquisac Archeologic District, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
Sites within this district are a possible Indian rancheria (41CH22), the second site of the
Presidio San Augustin de Ahumada (41CH53), Mission Nuestra Senora de la Luz,
(41CH54), the site of Blaincpain’s trading post (41CH57) destroyed by the Spanish, and
the first location of the presidio and mission. Site 41LB4 in Liberty County is described on
the site form as a historic Akokisa site, but no mention is made on the site form as to the
kinds of historic artifacts present. Sites 41CH110 and 41LB4 were listed in the National
Register of Historic Places as adjuncts to the district.
In Trinity County, a site that yielded a glass trade bead in association with Late
Prehistoric artifacts (41TN12) is located in a midden beneath a sandstone overhang. This
site was excavated by a local amateur archaeological society, and no report was
written. The primary author of this report witnessed work at the site. The age of this
site and the native group who occupied this site are not known.

19

In 1685, the French adventurer LaSalle and his entourage landed on the Texas
coast at Matagorda Bay. In 1687, he was again on Texas soil and was assassinated
near Navasota in Grimes County. A member of his party, Henry Joutel, led a group of
survivors (accompanied by Indian guides) across parts of Texas and into Mississippi.
Although it is not known if his travels took them into the present-day boundaries of the
Sam Houston National Forest, he did visit parts of Southeast Texas near the current
town of Huntsville. Joutel kept a diary that has been translated and reprinted (Foster
1998). He observed the local Indian villages and the habits of their occupants. Much of
what we know about the prehistory of parts of Texas is a direct result of his reporting.
There is no evidence of direct contact with Indian groups in the project area by early
European explorers.
In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, many tribes living in
the Southeast were being forced westward into Texas because of Anglo-American
expansion into their traditional territories. The Alabama and Coushatta entered Texas
as separate tribal entities, but they maintained close ties until they eventually merged in
the early 1800s. The exact date of the arrival of the Alabama into East Texas is not
known, but Castaneda (1936-1938) reports that the Hasinai and Bidai were being
harassed by this group armed by the Americans as early as 1795. When the present
reservation in adjacent Polk County near Livingston was established in 1854, the two
groups had merged. The Alabama-Coushatta is the only intrusive Indian tribe who lived
in the vicinity of the Sam Houston National Forest. Only one site (41SJ136) in the forest
is believed to date to the Alabama-Coushatta (see Archaeological Background above).
The best documented evidence of a site associated with the Alabama-Coushatta
in the region is the Arthur Patterson site (41SJ67) in San Jacinto County. This site is
located to the east of the Sam Houston National Forest near the town of Shepherd. The
original field surveyor’s notes describe the property where 41SJ67 is located as being
bounded on the northeast by lands owned by the Alabama-Coushatta. The present
reservation is about 50 miles to the northeast of the Arthur Patterson site. In 1969,
testing was conducted at 41SJ67 by members of the Houston Archeological Society
under the supervision of Dick Ping Hsu (1969). The goals of this testing were to date
the site, establish the most probable sources of the beads and silver, identify the
cultural group who occupied the site, infer the extent of acculturation from the burial
practices, and add to the knowledge of the area. Six burial pits were identified, and
excavation was conducted at three of the burials. European-made artifacts were
associated with all of the burials and included glass trade beads, clothing decorated
with glass beads, a bone-handled knife, small glass medicine bottle, coins, small metal
can, glass buttons, a ring, silver ornament, bracelets, glass goblet, stoneware plate, and
a glass jar. This site is believed to have been occupied during the 1840s or 1850s.

20

Early Settlement
With the end of the Spanish mission period in East Texas in 1772 and 1773, the
population of the area was a mixture of Spanish, French, Indian, and Negro settlers who
had congregated around Nuestra Senora del Pilar de los Adaes Presidio in
Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana (then considered to be part of East Texas) while it was a
provincial capital. The Spanish government moved the missions to the San Antonio
area and advised the settlers to leave East Texas because they could no longer be
protected. In 1774, Y’Barbo was allowed to return to East Texas and establish a new
settlement (Nuestra Senora de Pilar de Bucareli) on the Trinity River in present-day
Walker County. According to Crockett (1932), this settlement represents the subtle
beginnings of settlement in East Texas. Anglo-American settlement began in the lower
Trinity River region during the 1820s, and numerous Mexican land grants were awarded
in the area in the early 1830s. The first settlers subsisted through ranching and
agriculture. The early homes were log structures constructed of native timber.
According to Jordan (1978:181), the early log homes in East Texas were based on
styles perfected in the southern states of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.
Log homes were first introduced to the area circa 1815, and this tradition
persisted until the 1930s. Jordan states that East Texas is the stronghold of the dogtrot
house and slave cabin, and pine was the wood most often used. Near the town of
Evergreen (within the general boundaries of the Sam Houston National Forest) is the
Dabney log house, an excellent example of an early dogtrot house in the area
(Alexander 1966). According to Alexander, this is one of the finest examples of dovetail
joining to be found in Texas. He states that the logs are unusually well fitted, and one
log spans the entire length of the house and serves as a support for the joists for the
second floor of this story-and-a-half house. When last visited by the primary author of
this report, this house was in very poor condition. Jordan (1978:89) provides an
illustration of a pine log house of twentieth century construction in San Jacinto County.
The population of East Texas steadily increased due to the migration of people
who came mainly from the lower south and Europe following Texas’ independence in
1836 (Meining 1969:Map 6). The first post office in the area was established in 1847 in
the community of Coonskin (then in Polk County); its name was changed to Coldspring
in 1850. In 1870, the Texas legislature established San Jacinto County out of parts of
Liberty, Montgomery, Polk, and Walker counties with Coldspring as the county seat. In
the early days, transportation was overland by wagon and horse and slow to develop
with the exception of travel on the Trinity River by steamboat in the 1850s. Later, ferries
were established at various river crossings. Cotton was a major early crop in the area,
and bales of cotton were transported by steamboat or in wagons pulled by oxen. One
of the early academies in the area was the Cold Springs Female Institute, which opened
in 1854. Public schools were not in operation until several decades after the county
was formally established.

21

Shepherd is the county’s largest town and was named for B. A. Shepherd, a
banker and landowner who moved to San Jacinto County from Houston to locate a new
town in 1875. The Houston East and West Texas Railway passed through this newly
established town. A post office was established in Shepherd in 1879.
One of the earliest settlements in the area is Old Evergreen (now referred to as
Evergreen). Originally a stage stop on the Old San Antonio Road, it was platted as a
town in 1856. It prospered until 1890 when the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway
was constructed through nearby Lincoln. In 1990, nothing remained of the town but a
small cemetery and the old evergreen tree for which the community was named. This
community is in the general area of the Sam Houston National Forest.
Growth in the county slowed significantly in the early twentieth century. Due to
the development of mills in adjacent counties and poor transportation facilities within the
county, the population was only 9542 in 1910. By 1920, there were over 1600 farms in
the county, and the Negro population had grown to a high of 5487. The lumber industry
is the main source of income for many people in San Jacinto County, since most of the
land is located within the East Texas pine timber area. Several large lumber mills were
established along the Houston East and West Texas Railway.
Not one of these early mills was located in the current boundaries of the Sam
Houston National Forest. Thousands of acres were involved in timber management,
beginning with the holdings of the Gibbs brothers in 1869. The Foster Lumber
Company also owned thousands of acres of timberland along the East Fork of the San
Jacinto River. In 1935, this company sold 30,000 acres to the Federal government, and
it is this tract that became part of the Sam Houston National Forest that same year.
Today, one of the reminders of this industry is a series of now-abandoned trams
that served as the principal means of moving lumber from the forest to the main railroad
line that transported the lumber to the sawmill. They also served as a basic system of
transportation for the front camp workers. The front camp workers usually had families
living in the primary mill towns, and they utilized this network of trams as their major
source of getting from one place to another. Trams were extended throughout the
forests as the logging fronts advanced to new areas of virgin timber. These trams often
created an intricate network of cleared routes that would eventually become the basis
for a fully developed rural transportation system of Farm-to-Market roads. Trams were
numerous throughout East Texas. It was not uncommon for loggers to only have to
haul cut timber about one-quarter mile by mule or horse to reach the nearest tram.
Trams were also very crudely constructed. Often crossties from Sweet gum and other
available trees were used with spiking occasionally employed.

22

The tram roads, because of their temporary nature, were not tied together as well
as roads that were expected to last more than a year or two. Instead of ties being
spaced a foot apart, they may have been spaced two or three feet apart and with very
crude ties, perhaps only flat on one side. The object was to create a tram that would
allow the locomotive to transport the logs with the least work and cost. Although
horses, mules, and oxen were used to pull wagons on some of the early East Texas
trams, the steam locomotive quickly replaced this mode of transportation and became
the most efficient way to move timber. One of the locomotives used in the area was the
Shay locomotive, which was invented by Ephraim Shay from Michigan in the 1870s.
His invention was so effective that in 1878 he was able to reduce his selling price on
lumber from $3.50 per thousand board feet to $1.25 per thousand board feet.
Trams were not always elevated and, as a result, evidence of their existence did
not survive in every case. If the weather was dry and the ground was not swampy,
trams may have been built as a level road in places. Elevation was desirable when a
stable and dry route was needed or in order to avoid a steep grade. In low areas the
added dirt was called a “fill.” Sometimes trams had to cut through a hill. Most trams in
East Texas had many cuts and fills.
No historic logging camps have been identified in the Sam Houston National
Forest. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
established camps in San Jacinto County in an attempt to revive the local economy.
One of their projects was Double Lake, and it is located within the Sam Houston
National Forest. At the time the national forests in East Texas were created, the forests
were severely depleted. The CCC helped in the reforestation of the East Texas national
forests. The only recorded evidence of the CCC in the Sam Houston National Forest is
in the form of three camps (41MQ152, 41SJ120, and 41WA219) and a CCC dump
(41SJ165).
Today, the Sam Houston National Forest comprises 161,508 acres with 59,746
acres in San Jacinto County. It is administered by the United States Department of
Agriculture Forest Service local headquarters in Lufkin, Texas. The national forests are
managed on a multiple-use philosophy and are used for lumbering, grazing, production
of oil, hunting, and recreation. The Sam Houston National Forest surrounds Lake
Conroe and contains four recreation areas/campgrounds (Double Lake, Kelley Pond,
Stubblefield Lake, and Cagle Recreation Area) and one day use recreation area (Scott’s
Ridge). Recreational activities include camping, hunting, hiking, boating, and fishing.
The above information was taken from the Handbook of Texas Online, the
cultural resource overview of the national forests in Texas by Ippolito (1983), and other
sources cited in the text.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
General
It is beyond the scope of this report to document all work performed in San
Jacinto County by professional archaeologists. Therefore, this section discusses only
those major investigations and projects within the county and within the Sam Houston
National Forest, especially those in the project area. Although major archaeological
investigations have been conducted in San Jacinto County, the vast majority of work
has been small area surveys, often resulting in negative findings. Many of these
investigations resulted from the demand placed on the landscape by the oil and gas
industry or logging practices within the Sam Houston National Forest. Archaeologists at
the Sam Houston National Forest examine land for timber sales and other activities,
which adversely affect land under their jurisdiction. A review of the Abstracts in Texas
Contract Archeology series compiled by William E. Moore and published by the Texas
Historical Commission revealed only thirteen surveys by professional archaeologists
were performed in San Jacinto County during the period from 1987 through 1992. This
series contains abstracts for all reports on file at the Texas Historical Commission
during this period.
Previous Investigations in San Jacinto County
In 1985, there were 132 recorded sites in San Jacinto County. Since that time,
additional investigations have resulted in the documentation of over 190 sites as of the
writing of this report. The first major archaeological investigation to be conducted in
San Jacinto County consisted of survey and testing in the Livingston Reservoir. The
initial survey was conducted in 1963 by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project
(TASP) and recorded sites within and adjacent to the proposed lake (Nunley 1963), and
additional work was performed in 1965 and 1966 (McClurkan 1968). Most of the sites
located were found to occur towards the southeastern end of the lake. Two of the sites
found during the Lake Livingston survey in San Jacinto County were tested in 1965.
These were the Trichel site (41SJ16) excavated by TASP personnel and the Houston
site (41SJ19) excavated by members of the Houston Archeological Society. Both sites
have been classified as Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric in age based on the presence
of dart points, arrow points, and ceramics.

24

The only other prehistoric site to be excavated in San Jacinto County is the
Strawberry Hill site (41SJ160). This site was investigated by the Texas Highway
Department in 1974 (Keller and Weir 1979). Strawberry Hill yielded a large quantity of
artifacts but, according to the authors, produced little new information. It is described as
a multi-component site containing both Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials. The
report mentions a classic Scottsbluff point from this site, but later analysis revealed it to
be a large stemmed point that does not conform to a known type for the area. Artifacts
found at this site are typical for the area. A collection of specimens found on the
surface by the primary author prior to this excavation are discussed in a short journal
article by Moore and Dockall (1988). These artifacts are not mentioned in the report by
Keller and Weir (1979).
In 1969, testing was conducted at a historic Indian site (41SJ67) by members of
the Houston Archeological Society under the supervision of Dick Ping Hsu (1969). This
site is believed to represent the remains of members of the Alabama-Coushatta tribe
buried sometime between 1840 and 1850. This investigation is discussed in more detail
in the Culture Sequence section above.
Previous Investigations in the Sam Houston National Forest
In the 1960s, an archaeological survey was conducted in the Lake Conroe Basin
(Honea Reservoir) by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (Shafer 1966). Thirtyfour prehistoric sites were documented during this survey, and four of these sites were
partially excavated. This project recorded prehistoric sites 41MQ41, 41MQ42, and
41MQ43 overlooking the San Jacinto River within the Sam Houston National Forest.
Site 41MQ41 is described on the site form as an “open campsite” of unknown cultural
affiliation located on a low sandy rise sloping gently to the river floodplain. Flakes were
noted in rodent burrows, and a projectile point tip was collected. Site 41MQ42 is
described on the site form as an “open campsite” on a high sandy point sloping abruptly
into the San Jacinto River floodplain. Occasional flakes and bone were observed on the
surface. Site 41MQ43 is described on the site form as an “open campsite” dating to the
Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Neo-American periods. It is located on a high sandy point
overlooking the river. Artifacts collected include 1 Meserve-like projectile point, 28 dart
points and arrow points, 1 pitted stone, 13 ceramic sherds, and 12 miscellaneous tools.
This site was recommended for testing. No recommendations were made for the other
two sites. No shovel tests were excavated as each site was examined solely through a
surface inspection.

25

In 1974, archaeologists from Texas A&M University conducted an intensive
survey at the Scott’s Ridge and Cagle (spelled Kaygal in the report) recreation sites
adjacent to Lake Conroe in the Sam Houston National Forest. At the Scott’s Ridge
recreational area, three previously recorded prehistoric sites (41MQ41, 41MQ42, and
41MQ43) in Montgomery County were visited and assessed. All three sites are located
on the crests of ridges. At the Cagle recreational site, two previously unrecorded sites
were documented. They are a historic cemetery (41WA81) consisting of a small family
plot of three graves and a “lithic scatter” on the top and slopes of a ridge sloping to the
lake (41WA82). Three of the sites in the project area were considered to be important
archaeological resources worthy of additional work. Site 41MQ41 was viewed as
potentially significant based on the presence of large flakes and a greater use of chert
than in the other areas tested. To the researchers, this suggested a possible early date
for this site. Site 41MQ43 was viewed as potentially significant based on the large
number of artifacts collected in 1967 and the possibility of a Paleo-Indian component.
Site 41WA82 contains artifacts buried in a shallow sandy mantle. Since any
disturbance of the sandy mantle was believed by the researchers as a threat to the
archaeological context of this site, testing was recommended prior to future
construction.
In 1975, 41MQ41 was excavated by archaeologists from Texas A&M University
(Shafer and Stearns 1975) under the direction of Edward P. Baxter who was the Project
Archaeologist. Earlier, it had been hypothesized that this might be an early site, and this
was confirmed based on the presence of a San Patrice point, a corner-notched point, a
side-notched point, and an absence of ceramics. This investigation is discussed in more
detail in the Culture Sequence section above.
In 1978, site 41WA82 was excavated by archaeologists from Texas A&M
University and, at the time, represented the first reported subsurface investigation in
Walker County (McNatt 1978). This site is located on a ridge about 34 feet above the
San Jacinto River. Before the lake was created, three intermittent streams came
together just to the southeast of the site and flowed into the main river channel. Based
on the association of sandy-paste ceramics and contracting-stem dart points, this site
was assigned to the Early Ceramic Period (200 B.C. – A.D. 900). One contracting-stem
arrow point was found, which is indicative of a possible Late Ceramic occupation (A.D.
900 – A.D. 1700). This site is described in the report by McNatt (1978:36) as a
campsite where a diverse range of activities were carried out. This statement was
based on the projectile points, ceramics, bifaces, unifaces, lithic debitage, battered
stones, and burned rock. It was not recommended for additional work because the
remains were found to be thinly scattered, no apparent features were present, and a
paucity of diagnostic artifacts. Also, it was not recommended for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places because “it does not appear to hold any new scientific data
which would be useful in reconstructing the lifeways of prehistoric populations in the
area” (McNatt 1978:37).

26

In 1979, Ross C. Fields (1979) compiled an overview of the archaeology of the
National Forests of Texas. This report is a comprehensive examination of the TARL
files resulting in site summaries for each forest, preparation of one-page site data forms
for each site, and plotting of sites on USGS topographic quadrangles, many of which
were still printed at 15 minute scale at the time.
John E. Ippolito (1983) published his overview of the Texas national forests in
1983. This is a very thorough review of the archaeology and history of the four Texas
national forests. It discusses the previous cultures of the area, indigenous and intrusive
Indians, the development of the mission system in East Texas, and early logging
practices. The interested reader is encouraged to refer to this document for more
specific information for the Texas forests.
In 1993, the Central Coal and Coke Number 2-B well and access road was
examined by Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore 1993). One prehistoric site
was found and recorded as 41SJ48. It is located in Compartment 118. This site is
located on a sandy hill overlooking the floodplain of Winters Bayou to the southwest.
The East Fork of the San Jacinto River is not far to the east. Fourteen shovel tests only
yielded four flakes just beneath the humus zone at a depth of between 10 and 34 cm.
No diagnostic artifacts or features were found. Walter D. Kingsborough visited the site
with William E. Moore, and they dug additional shovel tests. Although more artifacts
were recovered, the site was not considered to contain research potential, and no
further work was recommended.
In 1995, a cultural resource management plan for the National Forests and
Grasslands in Texas was prepared by the Texas Historical Commission in a joint effort
with archaeologists from the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (Martin et al.
1995).
The major focus of this study was to identify previous work in the Texas
National Forests and Grasslands, identify Critical Resource Zones, and recommend
ways to manage and protect the cultural resources in these areas. Prior to 1991, there
was only one professional archaeologist in charge of all of the National Forests and
Grasslands in Texas. This individual was unable to keep up with the demand for survey
in areas that were scheduled for disturbance such as timber sales and clearing. In
1991, an assistant (Bob Skiles) was hired to help relieve the pressure of documenting,
testing, and protecting cultural resources in the National Forests and Grasslands. This
management plan identified three Critical Resource Zones (CRZ) in the Sam Houston
National Forest, the subject of this study. They are Stephens Creek (CRZ 17), Harmon
Creek (CRZ 18), and Winters Bayou (CRZ 19). The only Critical Resource Zone in the
current project area is CRZ 19. Within this zone there are nine compartments (112 114) and 119-124.
Of this group there are three “High Potential Priority 1
Compartments” (113, 114, and 120); one “Medium Potential Priority 2 Compartment”
(119); and five “Low Potential Priority 3 Compartments” (112, 121-124). According to
Martin et al. (1995:19), Critical Resource Zones are “areas where special archeological,
preservation, and management considerations are needed to protect and prevent
irreparable damage to important known archeological sites.”

27

The Storm site (41WA218) was tested in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, and
2006 by students from Rice University under the supervision of Dr. Rod McIntosh. This
site is very significant because it contains a stratified context that retains a high degree
of vertical integrity, a rare occurrence in much of Southeast Texas. Five radiometric
assays taken from carbonized nutshell have yielded dates from 2300 B.C. to A.D. 1280.
An in-depth report authored by Walter D. Kingsborough is in preparation. An interim
report has been prepared by Walter D. Kingsborough and Douglas G. Mangum (2000)
that is on file at the field office in New Waverly. The only documentation of the work by
the students from Rice University is a series of unpublished student papers.
In 2004, American Archaeology Group, LLC conducted a survey of the USA #3
well pad and associated pipeline (Bradle and Bernhardt 2005). The project area was
investigated through a surface inspection and use of a mechanical auger. One
prehistoric site (41SJ192) was found, and three flakes were recovered from two positive
auger tests between 30 and 40 cm below the surface. It was determined that the size of
this site is 5 meters x 5 meters. This site is in Compartment 95 and is located on a
slope on the north side of a flowing tributary of the North Fork of the San Jacinto River.
Site 41SJ192 was not considered to possess research potential, and further work was
not recommended.
Numerous in-house projects have been conducted by staff archaeologists at the
Sam Houston National Forest. Many of these investigations have been negative in
terms of locating archaeological sites. Most of the documentation regarding this work is
in the form of in-house letter reports that are not part of a numbered series. This
information was not available at the time of this writing and is not included here.

METHODS
Background Research
While the field survey was underway, the Principal Investigator conducted a
search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and reviewed archeological reports for the
area. The Sam Houston Regional Library and Research Center in Liberty, Texas was
also contacted for information relating to the project area. Maps on file at the Lufkin
office of the United Sates Forest Service in Lufkin, Texas were examined for the
presence of trams and other historical sites in the project area.
Field Methods
The field methods are based on a meeting held at the field office in New Waverly
on May 23, 2007. In attendance were John E. Ippolito (Heritage Resource Program
Manager for the National Forests & Grasslands in Texas), Barbara Williams (Assistant
Heritage Resource Program Manager for the National Forests and Grasslands in
Texas), Walter Kingsborough (District Archeologist for the Sam Houston National
Forest), and Edward P. Baxter, Project Archaeologist representing BVRA and DESCO.
After a review of project area maps, it was determined that all compartments
involved in this project should be considered to be medium or high probability for the
presence of archeological or historical properties, due to their proximity to the Winters
Bayou and the East Fork of the San Jacinto River watersheds. Based on this meeting,
the following methods were conducted. The project area was investigated by a surface
inspection of all disturbed areas and shovel testing at each source point identified by the
surveyors working in advance of the archaeologists.
The shovel test pattern was as follows:
•

Along source racks (a series of six source points), one shovel test was excavated
at each source point, and one shovel test was excavated between each source
point. This approximates a 30-meter shovel test interval.

•

Along access routes between racks of source points, shovel tests were
excavated at 50-meter intervals.

•

Shovel tests were excavated to sterile clay, water, or to a depth of one meter,
whichever occurred first.

•

A 100-foot wide strip (50 feet either side of the flagged route) was surveyed for
access routes in order to provide flexibility should access routes need to be
slightly altered.

When a previously unrecorded archaeological site was discovered, additional
shovel tests were excavated to determine site boundaries. These tests were placed in
a cruciform pattern based on the four cardinal directions. This is referred to in this
report as the site delineation phase. These shovel tests were excavated in intervals of
ten meters until two negative tests were encountered. In some cases, the landform
morphology dictated the exact layout of the pattern and was sometimes the primary
criteria used in determining site boundaries. Negative shovel tests were terminated
when they reached one meter in depth, sterile clay, or standing water. Once artifacts
were recovered, the test was identified as positive, and excavation was terminated. A
field map depicting the location of each shovel test in relation to the topography and any
distinguishing features was completed on acid-free cardstock. Shovel test forms,
printed on acid-free paper, were completed for each test and included the following
information: (1) seismic grid coordinates, (2) depth of each shovel test, (3) depth of
cultural materials, (4) kinds of artifacts recovered, and (5) type of soil present. Munsell
soil color chart readings were taken where appropriate. All artifacts found in shovel
tests were collected for analysis in the laboratory. They were placed in plastic bags that
contained basic information such as field site number, date of test, location and depth of
test, and recorder. Also, an artifact catalog tag printed on acid-free cardstock was filled
out with location data and project information.
All previously recorded sites and newly recorded sites were marked with
identifying paint in a method approved by the United States Forest Service. Previously
recorded site 41SJ38 was visited, and. it was determined that the location on the site
form was not accurate. Therefore, a site revisit form was completed and submitted to
TARL. A protective buffer was placed around all historic and archaeological sites on the
project area maps. Historic sites received a buffer of 30 meters, and prehistoric sites
received a buffer of 50 meters. No drilling or drill access will be allowed inside this
buffer.
When convenient, trams were used as access routes, provided there were no
other associated cultural features related to the early 20th century logging industry or
railroads present. When such features were present, that segment of tram was
considered a heritage resource and recorded as such with a recommendation of
avoidance by all activities associated with this project. Trams without associated cultural
features were noted and annotated on topographic maps but not formally recorded and
documented as heritage resource sites. Logging roads were used as drill access routes
without shovel testing.

Laboratory Analyses and Database Entries
A complete listing of all areas investigated during the field survey appears on a
Compact Disk at the back of this report as Appendix IV. This Compact Disk contains
two files: instructions as to how to access and interpret the data and the raw data on an
excel spreadsheet. The majority of the artifacts were analyzed by William A. Dickens
(see Artifact Analysis below); however, Rita D. Fields gave a second opinion regarding
the ceramics, and she illustrated the rim sherd from site 41SJ203. Some of the lithics
were determined to be non-cultural by Mr. Dickens. These items include specimens
made of chert that were crazed, fractured, and pot-lidded. He believes these items
occurred naturally as pebbles and were altered due to natural causes such as grass
fires and freezing temperatures. They were separated from the cultural materials and
placed in separate bags as part of the curation package to ensure their availability to
future researchers who may have a different opinion. Attributes for the three major
classes of artifacts (projectile points, flakes, and ceramics) appear in tabular form as
part of the records submitted for curation. Completed forms for each archeological site
were submitted to TARL where official state trinomial site numbers were assigned.
Standard procedures for analyzing artifacts were followed.
Report Preparation and Submission
Following completion of all fieldwork, three copies of the draft report were
submitted to the United States Department of Agriculture, National Forests and
Grasslands in Texas, and one copy was submitted to the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division for review. Following review by these agencies, all comments were
addressed in the final report, and the requisite number of final report copies were
delivered to all concerned parties. The Principal Investigator is the first author and is
responsible for preparing a report that will satisfy the United States Department of
Agriculture, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas and the Texas Historical
Commission.
Curation
All artifacts and records generated by this project have been submitted to the
United States Department of Agriculture, National Forests and Grasslands in Lufkin,
Texas for curation.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
Introduction
Thirteen prehistoric archaeological sites (41SJ194 – 41SJ206) and five isolated
finds (IF-1 – IF-5) containing prehistoric artifacts were recorded in the project area. Artifact
totals for all sites and isolated finds are 5 projectile points, 1 biface, 2 tested cobbles, 178
pieces of flake debitage, 12 ceramic sherds, and 3 fragments of faunal bone. The two
flakes from 41SJ206 were accidentally discarded and are not discussed in this report.
The following is a discussion of the artifacts recovered from each site. Each artifact
was analyzed for those attributes considered significant for each artifact type. For
example, each flake was analyzed for its condition, flake type, material type, platform type,
ventral surface characteristics, presence of burning, and color using the Munsell soil color
chart. In addition, all of the flakes were size graded by passing them through a series of
eight nested screens. Size grading is considered important because it has been
determined that reductive processes and stages of reduction for bifacial tool manufacture
can be defined through the maximum size of a flake (Ahler 1989; Stahle and Dunn
1982:86). When applying this strategy, it must be kept in mind that all sizes of flakes will
be produced during each stage of manufacture and that primarily smaller flakes will be
produced during maintenance tasks. The screen sizes utilized are Size Grade 1 (50 mm
or 1 inch), Size Grade 2 (37.5 mm or 1 ½ inch), Size Grade 3 (25 mm or 3/8 inch), Size
Grade 4 (19 mm or 3/4 inch, Size Grade 5 (12.5 mm or ½ inch), Size Grade 6 (9.5 mm or
3/8 inch), Size Grade 7 (6.3 mm or ¼ inch), and Size Grade 8 (less than 6.3 mm). The
projectile points were analyzed according to type (when possible); length, width, and
thickness; juncture width; condition; and material. The depth at which each point was
found is also mentioned when known. The ceramics were analyzed according to type,
decoration (if present), temper, and thickness. A complete listing of attributes tabulated for
each artifact type and a key to the Munsell colors mentioned for the flakes and ceramics is
provided in tabular form and is curated with the records. Some of the lithic materials
collected in the field were determined during analysis in the laboratory to be non-cultural.
These are specimens that do not exhibit the normal attributes of flakes and were probably
altered through natural processes such as fires and exposure to the elements, especially
freezing temperatures. These items have no research value and are not discussed in this
report. However, they have been added to the materials to be curated, as it is BVRA
policy not to discard any questionable materials.

41SJ194
This site includes 1 arrow point, 30 flakes, and 4 ceramic sherds. The projectile
point was found between 20 cm and 30 cm and is a small arrow point missing a portion of
the stem. The overall shape of the blade has a triangular shape, strong barbs, and a
serrated edge. The remaining portion of the stem is slightly contracting. The presence of
serrations suggests this specimen to be a finished point. It is made of chert and measures
15.7 mm long, 15.3 mm wide, 2.7 mm thick, and has a juncture width of 3.4 mm. Possible
subjection to heat is suggested by a reddish color on its edges and tip. It is illustrated in
Figure 28.

Figure 28. Arrow Point from 41SJ194

The flakes consist of chert (n=9) and quartzite (n=21) found at varying depths
between 4 cm and 95 cm. Eight are primary flakes, 10 are secondary flakes, and 12 are
interior flakes. Size grades are Size Grade 5 (n=4), Size Grade 6 (n=11), Size Grade 7
(n=10), and Size Grade 8 (n=5). Fifteen flakes are complete, 7 are proximal fragments, 4
are midsections, and 4 are distal fragments. Those with platforms include 12 natural
platforms, 8 plain platforms, 1 dihedral platform, and 1 polyhedral platform, with one
natural platform and three plain platforms being lipped. Eleven of the ventral surfaces
contain bulbs of percussion, 10 are diffuse or flat, and 2 are irregular. The edges or
surfaces of seven flakes exhibit a reddish color that is a result of exposure to heat.

69

The pottery sample includes two sherds found between 18 cm and 22 cm in Shovel
Test 1 and two sherds found between 20 cm and 30 cm in Shovel Test 2. All are body
sherds and range in thickness from 6.3 mm to 6.7 mm. All have a sandy-paste temper
with fine to medium sized grains of sand. Those from Shovel Test 2 are poorly preserved,
being very friable to the touch.
The sherds from Shovel Test 1 are both yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) on the interior
and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) on the exterior. One sherd from Shovel Test 2 is a yellowish
brown (10YR 5/4) on its exterior and yellowish red (5YR 5/6) on its interior. The remaining
flake is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) on its exterior surface and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6)
on its interior surface. The thickness and similar colors of the two sherds from Shovel Test
1 are from the same vessel, and both sherds from Shovel Test 2 are from the same
vessel.
41SJ195
This site yielded one biface (Figure 29) and eleven flakes. The biface was found
between 10 cm and 15 cm and is the proximal end of a mid-to-late stage biface. It
measures 22.9 mm long, 20.6 mm wide, and 5.9 mm thick. It is made of chert that has
been heated along one edge. This heating probably occurred after abandonment and was
probably not the cause of breakage. In this case, breakage was probably the result of a
knapping error or poor quality material.
The flake debitage was found between 10 cm and 30 cm. They include five
specimens of chert, four specimens of quartzite, one specimen of jasper, and one
specimen of silicified wood. Four flakes are complete, three are proximal fragments, one
is a midsection, and three are distal fragments. One is a primary flake, five are secondary
flakes, and five are interior (tertiary) flakes. One is a Size Grade 5, one is a Size Grade 6,
five are a Size Grade 7, and four are a Size Grade 8. Those retaining their platforms
include two natural platforms and three plain platforms with no evidence of lipping. Five
flakes have ventral surfaces with bulbs of percussion and one that is diffuse or flat.
Evidence of exposure to heat is present on the edges of two flakes that exhibit a reddish
color, and the entire surface of one specimen has turned a reddish color.

41SJ196
This site contains five flakes found between 20 cm and 60 cm. They are one
primary flake, two secondary flakes, and two interior flakes. The raw material is chert
(n=1), quartzite (n=3), and silicified wood (n=1). Three are complete, one is a mid-section,
and one is a distal fragment. Those retaining platforms include three natural platforms and
one plain platform. Three have bulbs of percussion, and one is diffuse or flat on its ventral
surface. Only one flake is burned, being pot-lidded and slightly crazed.
41SJ197
This site is represented by 1 tested cobble, 64 flakes, 4 ceramic sherds, and 3
fragments of bone. Twenty-seven shovel tests were positive and varied in depth from 7
cm to 95 cm. A flattened, slightly "L-shaped” chert cobble found at a depth of 35 cm was
unifacially flaked along one edge. It measures 80 mm long, 50.9 mm wide, and 13.2 mm
thick, and its color is a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2). Four prominent flakes were
removed by the hard hammer method along its longest lateral edge. The material appears
to be suitable for further reduction; that is, no major defects such as inclusions, cracks, or
crazing were noted. Therefore, the reason for abandonment is unknown. It is illustrated
in Figure 30.

71

Figure 30. Tested Cobble from 41SJ197
The flake debitage was found between 0 cm and 70 cm and consists of 49
complete flakes, 9 proximal flakes, 2 medial flakes, and 4 distal fragments. Material types
for the flakes include chert (n=40), quartzite (n=17), silicified wood (n=5), jasper (n=1), and
silicified wood (n=1). Size grades range from Size Grade 5 to Size grade 8; however most
specimens are small. For example, Size Grade 5 makes up 6% of the total, Size Grade 6
is 24% of the total, Size Grade 7 is 58% of the total, and Size Grade 8 is 12% of the total.
Thirty-three of the flakes retain varying amounts of cortex. This cortex is thin and hard
which is indicative of cortex found on gravel or cobbles. Twenty-one have plain platforms,
22 have natural platforms, and 5 have dihedral platforms. Many of the flakes with natural
platforms (or platforms covered with cortex) have cortex only on the platforms. At least
thirty-eight flakes have obvious bulbs of percussion on their ventral surface, and twentytwo are diffuse or flat. Ten are lipped at the platform. Burning is evident on twenty flakes
ranging from minor edge reddening to severe crazing.
The four pottery sherds were found between 85 cm and 100 cm in Shovel Test 1
(n=2), at 45 cm in Shovel Test 18 (n=1), and at 35 cm in Shovel Test 48 (n=1). All are
small plain body sherds with a thickness that ranges from 4.8 mm to 6.2 mm. Two sherds
may be from the same vessel. All have a sandy-paste temper, although the sand particles
range from fine to medium sized grain sizes. The Munsell colors for these sherds are
10YR 4/6 (dark yellowish brown).

72

The faunal remains include three small fragments. The largest fragment is part of a
sacrum from a small rodent such as squirrel (Sciurus sp.) or woodrat (Neotoma sp.)
(Olsen 1990:95-96). Unfortunately, it is too damaged for exact species identification. The
second fragment is also heavily degraded, but it appears to be the proximal end of the
diaphysis of a tibia belonging to a small rodent similar to either squirrel or wood rat (Olsen
1990:127-128). The third fragment is a very small flat bone that has similarities to turtle
shell such as Terrapene carolina sp. or the common box turtle, a very common species
throughout the inland regions of southeast Texas. Not one of the bones showed burning
or evidence of damage caused by humans.
41SJ198
This site is comprised of six flakes and two pottery sherds. The flakes were found
between 0 cm and 42 cm. Three are made of chert, and three are made of quartzite.
Three are complete, one is a proximal fragment, and two are distal fragments. All are
secondary types except one that is an interior flake. One is a Size Grade 4, two are Size
Grade 5, one is a Size Grade 6, and two are Size Grade 7. Those containing platforms
are all of the plain type with four having bulbs of percussion on their ventral surfaces. Only
one was burned and pot-lidded.
Both pottery sherds were both found at a depth of 40 cm, and both are plain body
fragments. The larger specimen measures 31.9 mm long, 27.8 mm wide, and 7.6 mm
thick. It has a sandy-paste temper comprised of small to large grains of sand. Its color is
a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4). The second sherd is very small, being 13.5 mm long,
8.9 mm wide, and 7.5 mm thick. It is also has a sandy paste temper with fine to large sand
grains. Its color is brownish yellow (10YR 6/6). This sherd may be from the same vessel
as the larger sherd.
41SJ199
This site is comprised of one projectile point and ten flakes. The projectile point
was found at a depth of 27 cm and is the proximal half of a small arrow point (Figure 31).
This specimen measures 15.4 mm long, 21.8 mm wide, and 3.3 mm thick. It has a
juncture width of 5.6 mm. It is made of a heavily mottled chert. The Munsell color is dusky
red (10R 3/4). This specimen could not be assigned to a known type.

73

Figure 31. Arrow Point from 41SJ199
The flakes were found between 20 cm and 40 cm, and all but one is made of chert.
The other specimen is quartzite. Four are complete, two are midsections and four are
distal fragments. All are secondary types, except one that is interior. Size grades include
Size Grade 7 (n=9) and Size Grade 8 (n=1). Only two of the complete flakes retain their
platforms, which are plain with three having bulbs of percussion and one with a diffuse
ventral surface. Three show subjection to heat with one of these being pot-lidded.
41SJ200
This site is comprised of nine flakes found between 20 cm and 80 cm. Five are
made of chert, 3 are quartzite, and 1 is silicified wood. All are Size Grade 7, except one
that is Size Grade 8. Six are complete, one is a proximal fragment, and two are distal
fragments. Eight are secondary flakes, and one is an interior type. Those with platforms
include four natural platforms and three plain platforms. Three are lipped, two have bulbs
of percussion, and four have diffuse ventral surfaces. One of the lipped platforms is also
associated with a bulb of percussion on the ventral surface. Burning is present on six
flakes with one being crazed.
41SJ201
This site is represented by one projectile point fragment (Figure 32) and one flake.
The projectile point was found between 20 cm and 30 cm and is the mid-section of a dart
point that cannot be typed. It is made of chert and measures 33.1 mm long, 21.7 mm
wide, and 7.1 mm thick. It has a juncture width of 16.1 mm. Its edges are slightly twisted,
and the cross-section of the blade is plano-convex. The single chert flake was recovered
at 30 cm and is a distal half, secondary type, and was measured as Size Grade 6. Due to
its fragmentary condition, no platform or definitive ventral characteristics can be
determined. It is pot-lidded, an indication of alteration by heat.

74

Figure 32. Projectile Point Fragment from 41SJ201
41SJ202
This site is comprised of five flakes found between 10 cm and 59 cm. The flakes
were found between 10 cm and 50 cm and include chert (n=2), silicified wood (n=1) and
silicified wood (n=2). The size grades are 5 (n=1), 6 (n=1), 7 (n=2), and 8 (n=1). Three
are complete, one is a proximal fragment, and one is a distal fragment. Those retaining
platforms include two natural platforms and two plain platforms with one being lipped. The
ventral surfaces of three specimens contain bulbs of percussion, and two are diffuse.
Burning is not evident on any of the flakes.
41SJ203
This site is consists of one flake and one ceramic sherd, both found at 55 cm. The
flake is an interior proximal fragment, and it is made of quartzite. It is Size Grade 6, has a
plain platform, and a slight bulb of percussion on its ventral surface. No evidence of
burning was observed. The ceramic fragment is a rim sherd. The rim rounds slightly from
the interior to the exterior. It is undecorated and has a thickness of 5.9 mm, slightly
thickening on the rim to 6.5 mm. It is made of a sandy-paste temper composed of fine
sand grains. Its exterior color is dark yellow-brown (10YR 4/4), and the interior is brownyellow (10YR 6/6). It is illustrated in Figure 33.

75

Figure 33. Ceramic Rim Sherd from 41SJ203 (actual size)
41SJ204
This site is represented by two chert flakes. One flake was recovered between 0
cm and 5 cm, and the other was recovered between 80 cm and 90 cm. One is a
secondary flake, the other is an interior flake, and both are complete. One has a plain
platform, and the platform on the other specimen is crushed. Both have bulbs of
percussion on their ventral surfaces. Neither shows any evidence of burning.
41SJ205
This site is comprised of 1 projectile point stem, 1 tested cobble, and 26 flakes.
The arrow point stem was found at 30 cm and is contracting in shape. It measures 12.9
mm long, 5.5 mm wide, and 2.7 mm thick.
The tested cobble is made on a small water-worn, plano-convex chert cobble found
between 20 cm and 30 cm. It measures 43.4 mm long, 33.7 mm wide, and 15.2 mm thick.
Several hard hammer flakes have been removed from its flat ventral surface. The material
is not suitable for reduction, being rough and grainy, which (along with the small size) are
the probable reasons for it's abandonment.

76

Materials making up the flakes include chert (n=15), quartzite (n=10), and jasper
(n=1). They were found between 0 cm and 80 cm. Fourteen are complete, 3 are proximal
fragments, 2 are midsections, and 7 are distal fragments. Three are primary flakes, 9 are
secondary flakes, and fourteen are interior flakes. Size grades include Size Grade 5
(n=2), Size Grade 6 (n=8), Size Grade 7 (n=14), and Size Grade 8 (n=2). Those with
platforms include six natural platforms and six plain platforms. One of the plain platforms
is lipped, 10 of the ventral surfaces contain bulbs, and 6 are diffuse. Burning is evident on
eight flakes with two being pot-lidded. The rest exhibit a red color present only on their
edges.
41SJ206
This site is comprised of one ceramic sherd and two flakes. The flakes were found
between 0 cm and 20 cm, and the sherd was found between 40 cm and 50 cm in Shovel
Test 2. Unfortunately, the flakes were accidentally discarded. The sherd is a body sherd.
It is undecorated, and the temper is sandy-paste. Its color is yellow brown (7.5YR 5.4). Its
length is 21.1 mm, its width is 15.2 mm, and its thickness is 5.8 mm.
Isolated Find 1
This locality is considered to be an isolated find due to the presence of only one
flake found in thirteen shovel tests. It was found at 20 cm. It is a complete interior chert
flake (Size Grade 8) with a plain platform and a slight bulb of percussion on its ventral
surface. No evidence of heating was observed.
Isolated Find 2
This locality is considered to be an isolated find due to the presence of only two
flakes in eleven shovel tests. They were found at a depth of 35 cm. Both flakes are
broken (one a proximal half and the other a distal portion), Size Grade 7, interior types,
unheated, and made of chert. The proximal specimen has a plain platform with a
prominent bulb of percussion on its ventral surface indicating hard hammer removal.
Because the second flake is represented only by the distal portion, the platform type and
ventral surface characteristics cannot be determined.
Isolated Find 3
This locality is considered to be an isolated find due to the presence of only one
flake in thirteen shovel tests. It was recovered at 47 cm. It is a complete quartzite flake,
interior type, Size Grade 5, with a natural platform, and a bulb of percussion on its ventral
surface.

77

Isolated Find 4
This locality is considered to be an isolated find due to the presence of only one
flake in eight shovel tests. It was recovered between 10 and 20 cm. It is a complete
secondary stage flake made from quartzite and measured as Size Grade 7. Its edges are
reddish in color from exposure to heat. The platform is crushed, but a lip remains, and the
ventral surface is diffuse.
Isolated Find 5
This locality is considered to be an isolated find due to the presence of a single
projectile point fragment in nine shovel tests (Figure 35). This specimen cannot be
identified by type. It was found at a depth of 30 cm and is incomplete with the basal
portion (stem) missing due to a bend break. It measures 22.6 mm long, 16.9 mm wide,
and 6.8 mm thick and is made of unheated, fine-grained, slightly semi-translucent chert
having a Munsell color of 7.5YR 4/6 (strong brown). The cross-section is plano-convex
with some remnants of cortex present on both sides indicating it was made on a small
tabular cobble.

Discussion
The analysis of the artifacts recovered from the project area in the Sam Houston
National Forest revealed the presence of at least two temporal components, Archaic and
Late Prehistoric. Evidence of the Archaic Stage was found at 41SJ201 and Isolated Find
5 where dart point fragments were recovered. It was not possible to identify the dart points
by type. All that can be said is that they are typical of the Archaic Stage within the inland
region of Southeast Texas, and they probably date to sometime prior to A.D. 400 (Ensor et
al. 1991:Figure 2). Although the late stage biface from 41SJ195 can’t be assigned to a
temporal period, similar bifaces in this part of Texas have been documented at sites dating
to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric stages. Also, bifaces were not always used for the
explicit manufacture of projectile points, as they could have been used or made into a
number of other tools, such as scrapers, gouges, or knives.
The presence of arrow points and ceramic sherds indicate a Late Prehistoric
component at seven of the sites. These are 41SJ194 with one arrow point and four
ceramic sherds, 41SJ197 with four ceramic sherds, 41SJ198 with two ceramic sherds,
41SJ199 with one arrow point, 41SJ203 with one ceramic sherd, 41SJ205 with one arrow
point, and 41SJ206 with one ceramic sherd. The two arrow points could not be assigned
to a particular type; therefore, their age is not known. Not one of the pottery sherds could
be dated. They can only be assigned to the Late Prehistoric period of the inland region of
Southeast Texas beginning with the Early Ceramic Period, circa A.D. 400 and ending with
the Late Ceramic Period, circa A.D. 1750 (Ensor et al. 1991:Figure 2). All of the ceramic
sherds have a sandy-paste temper and are undecorated. Each sherd was examined
under a 10-power microscope. It was found that several grades of sand were used in the
temper of the various sherds. The sizes of the sand grains were subjectively divided into
fine, medium, and large. A few of the sherds contain a fine-grain temper, while most
contain temper with medium to larger sand grains, some being visible without the aid of a
microscope. One specimen is a rim sherd, and the rest are body sherds.
The vast majority of the flake debitage recovered are small flakes, less than 3/8
inches in size (Size Grade 5). Since only one unfinished biface was found, primary
reduction and manufacture does not seem to have been a major activity at the sites. The
small size of the debitage indicates that tool maintenance activities or small expedient tool
manufacture were probably the primary tasks. It can be argued that arrow point
manufacture typically produces small flakes, but (as mentioned above) larger tools were
also part of the Late Prehistoric tool kits and (as such) larger flakes are often present
within Late Prehistoric components.

79

Another argument would be that the general sizes of the raw materials were small
and would not produce large flakes or tools. Only a very few primary flakes were found,
but a fair amount of secondary flakes was noted. This suggests that roughed out blanks
(some retaining varying amounts of cortex) could have been brought to these sites where
they were finished into usable tools, and any usable flakes were collected to be used
elsewhere.
The attributes noted on the flakes indicate the material used was primarily small
river cobbles and chunks of silicified wood. The local gravels are primarily made up of
chert cobbles, but other materials such as jasper and various forms of silicified wood are
also commonly found in the gravel mix. The two tested cobbles from 41SJ197 and
41SJ205 are good examples of the size of some of the chert cobbles found within the local
gravels.
Both hard and soft hammer reduction is evident. Typical hard hammer flake
removal is evidenced by flakes with bulbs of percussion on their ventral surfaces, while
soft hammer removals have diffuse or flat ventral surfaces and occasionally a small ridge
or lip on the ventral edge of the platform. The presence of some cortex only on the
platforms suggests that many flakes were removed from unprepared edges, a technique
used on small cobbles that allows for the maximum width of the material to be retained
until the final stages of manufacture (Dickens 1995:200). During preparation of platforms,
material is removed and repetitive establishment or creation of the platform will eventually
significantly reduce the material's width.
However, as indicated above, the cortex on cobbles is thin and hard and (as such)
does not require removal for flaking (Dickens 1993:134-135). Therefore, little edge
preparation is required for the creation of a platform, allowing little reduction of the
material’s width. Not one of the burned flakes showed evidence of purposeful heat
alteration. Heat-treating is considered a common method of altering some lithic materials
in an attempt to improve the flaking qualities (Whittaker 1994:72-74). Evidence for this is
usually in the form of surface coloring, usually a reddish color due to iron content within the
material on one side, while the other side may have a glossy, greasy appearance and feel.
This is an indication that the flake was removed after heating had occurred. However, all
of the burned flakes recovered had been colored or pot-lidded on both sides indicating
heating after flaking or were colored only around the edges, also indicating heating after
flaking. Most likely, the heating occurred from either natural grass fires or those set on
purpose. It has been demonstrated that prehistoric peoples often set fires as a tool to
control their environment (DeVivo 1990:308; Dickens and Wiederhold 2003:44-45). Such
fires could easily alter the color of flakes or other lithic debris lying on the surface.

80

The non-cultural materials mentioned above might be regarded by some
researchers as shatter, a by-product of tool manufacture, which is a cultural event. It is
often difficult to make the distinction between naturally altered lithics and shatter,
especially since shatter is not consciously produced with specific physical attributes for
specific purposes. This is clearly illustrated by an exhibit in the Museum of Archaeology
and Material Culture in Cedar Crest, New Mexico. The various stages of projectile point
manufacture are frozen in time in that the flintknapper retained all flakes and shatter from
each stage of the reduction process. The resulting debitage assemblage consists of
flakes and other materials such as shatter which would not be recognizable in the
archaeological record as by-products of the tool manufacturing sequence if found in an
isolated context. Pieces of shatter are often morphologically similar (if not identical) to
each other and have little or no research value except that attest to the fact that lithic
reduction was an activity that was carried out at the site. In some cases, pieces of shatter
may retain some cortex, which would be evidence of primary reduction.
In conclusion, the artifact assemblages recovered from the survey of the project
area within the Sam Houston National Forest show that two temporal periods of
occupation are present. These are the Archaic supported by dart points and the Late
Prehistoric supported by arrow points and pottery sherds. As stated above, size grading of
the debitage indicated that activities associated with site occupation at some sites were
related to expedient tool manufacture and tool maintenance tasks utilizing local materials.
The presence of dart points and arrow points is an indication that hunting was probably
one of the activities conducted. The lack of primary reduction debitage such as bifaces
and primary flakes at most of the sites indicates that these sites were probably small
seasonally occupied areas where tool maintenance and harvesting related tasks were
carried out. Analysis of the raw materials revealed the occupants of the sites in the
project area utilized local materials for tool manufacture and tool maintenance activities.
Platform data were collected in an attempt to understand the reduction technologies
present at the sites. Size grade data, ventral characteristics (bulb of percussion and
platform lipping), and platform data tell the researcher what technological strategies were
conducted at the site. The analysis of these attributes helps the researcher understand
what kinds of occupational activities were conducted. Due to the small sample size of
artifacts at many of the sites, it was not possible to arrive at meaningful conclusions
regarding the total tasks conducted at these sites.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
The records check at TARL revealed several major projects have been conducted
in the Sam Houston National Forest and general area as well as small area studies, many
of which did not locate sites. According to Jean Hughes, the TARL files contain site forms
for at least 190 archaeological sites in San Jacinto County. Prior to the current field
survey, 172 prehistoric sites (Appendix II) and 39 historic sites (Appendix III) had been
recorded in the Sam Houston National Forest by various archaeological contractors and
United States Forest Service archaeologists. At the same time, only three prehistoric sites
(41SJ38, 41SJ50, and 41SJ54) and one isolated find (99SH120-1) had been recorded in
the project area by United States Forest Service archaeologists. In addition, one historic
site (the Hugh Stewart cabin) is reputed to be in the project area, but this site has not been
visited in the field and confirmed. The isolated find was a single Archaic projectile point
with no additional artifacts present. The three previously recorded sites date to the Late
Prehistoric period based on the presence of ceramics. Sites 41SJ38 and 41SJ50 are
recommended for protection and testing. No recommendations were made on the site
form for 41SJ54. The archival search produced evidence of logging in the project area in
the form of trams as evidenced on a map on file at the New Waverly office. No towns or
cemeteries were found to be within the current project area.
Field Survey
This project identified and recorded thirteen prehistoric sites (41SJ194 – 41SJ206)
and five isolated finds (IF 1 – IF 5). Normally, an isolated find is defined as a single artifact
found with no discernable association with other artifacts or features. During this project,
however, sites with two artifacts or less received the designation of an Isolated Find.
Basic data for the thirteen newly recorded sites is presented in Table 1, and similar
information for the five isolated finds is presented in Table 2. The shovel test logs for each
site and isolated find are presented in Appendix V. The location of each site and isolated
find on USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangles is found in Appendix VI. The majority of sites
(n=12) and isolated finds (n=4) were found in the three “High Potential Priority 1
Compartments.” The remaining sites (n=1) and isolated finds (n=1) were found in “Low
Potential Priority 2 Compartments.” No sites or isolated finds were found in the “Medium
Potential Priority 3 Compartment.” The three previously recorded sites in the project area
are located in “High Potential Priority 1 Compartments.” The following information was
taken, in part, from the artifact analysis (see above), and it is summarized below.

82

Table 1. Prehistoric Sites in the Project Area

The thirteen sites and five isolated finds present a general picture of prehistoric
utilization of the project area. This information is incomplete because of the policy that
called for the field crew to terminate shovel tests when artifacts were encountered. It is,
therefore, possible that some of the sites listed as Unknown Prehistoric might have
produced diagnostic artifacts if the field crew had dug each positive test to the sterile clay
that pre-dates human occupation. We are able, however, to state that prehistoric sites in
the project area tend to be found on landforms containing sandy soils. The localities
where the sites are located are varied and consist of toe slopes, ridge tops, and small rises
in floodplains. Distance to water varies from 10 meters to 1.2 kilometers.

83

Table 2. Isolated Finds in the Project Area

Lithic artifacts in the project area consist of arrow point fragments, dart point
fragments, bifaces, tested cobbles, and debitage. Most of the specimens are made from
chert cobbles probably procured from lag deposits (gravel bars) in nearby streams.
Jasper and silicified wood suitable for the manufacture of stone tools is sometimes found
in these deposits, and these materials were also utilized. The size of the flakes is small,
as most specimens measure at less than 3/8 inch (size grade 5). This suggests that the
primary tasks at most of the sites in the project area were related to tool maintenance or
small expedient tool manufacture.
Based on the few diagnostic specimens recovered in the project area, it can be
stated that human occupation was present sometime during the Archaic Stage through
Late Prehistoric times. The Archaic Stage is represented by the presence of dart point
fragments at 41SJ201 and IF 5. Since these specimens are medial sections and distal
tips, they cannot be assigned to a specific period within the Archaic Stage. The presence
of arrow points and ceramics are indicators of Late Prehistoric occupation, and six of the
thirteen sites date to this period (Table 1). The arrow points are could not be assigned to
a particular type, and the ceramics are undecorated. Therefore, these artifacts can only
be dated to sometime within the Late Prehistoric period, probably between A.D. 400 and
A.D. 1750.

84

Shovel tests at the thirteen sites were excavated to depths of 65 cm to 100 cm.
Some of the negative tests did not encounter clay, and they were dug through sandy soil
and terminated when they reached 100 cm, a depth that is considered by most
archaeologists to be the maximum for hand excavation with a shovel. Some of the shovel
tests at the isolated finds were terminated when clay, silt, or gravel was encountered. The
deepest artifacts were found between 85 cm and 100 cm, and most were recovered at
depths of 50 cm or less. No artifacts were found on the surface. The size of the sites in
the project area was determined through shovel testing, and they vary from 128 square
meters to 7900 square meters.
Not one of the prehistoric sites found in the current project area are viewed here as
permanent camps. It is known from the diary kept by Henri Joutel (Foster 1998) that
Indians in the general area from Matagorda Bay to what is now Huntsville, Texas
subsisted on hunting and gathering and were constantly on the move. He observed some
groups planting beans and squash on hills far from, water. They did not stay in these
locations very long due to their fear of being found by their enemies. Rather, they would
return to these areas hoping to find their crops intact. In the area traveled by Joutel, he
mentions 50 tribes with different names. In his diary, Joutel says that major streams often
defined tribal areas. It is not possible to compare the sites in the project area with these
groups based on the limited amount of data collected during this project. But, it is
reasonable to assume that these small sites may represent activity areas away from the
main camps.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Since the seismic survey will avoid all known archaeological sites within the project
area, it is recommended that the survey be allowed to proceed as planned.
Archaeological monitors will be present during drilling activities. If a route segment or
source point location needs to be changed, the drill will either stop at that location and wait
for an inspection by the monitor or turn around and retrace its track and then work
elsewhere along approved routes until the new route is inspected by the monitors.
Methods of inspection will be the same as in the initial environmental studies. If the
inspections revel no cultural resource site, the monitors will have the ability to clear new
routes and/or access points in the field and give the drillers approval to proceed.
Any cultural resource sites encountered will be delineated, marked in the field, and
buffered as per the original survey methods. Prior to delineation, the source point and/or
access route will be moved an appropriate distance from the positive shovel test, and
shovel testing will be employed along the new route. If these tests are positive, the route
will be moved again. When a route is found with no positive tests, it will be flagged. A
second series of shovel tests paralleling the newly flagged route will be placed 50 meters
(164 feet) from the new route on the side fronting the cultural resource site. If these are
negative, a buffer of at least 50 meters will be established between the cultural resource
site and the drill activity area. The site could then be delineated after the drill had passed.
At the conclusion of the drilling activities within the Sam Houston National Forest a
narrative of the monitoring activities and any new site information will be presented as an
addendum to the archaeological report for this project.

APPENDIX I
SEISMIC SURVEY METHODS
The general technique of the type of geophysical exploration proposed is
referred to as the seismic reflection method. This method utilizes an energy
source, which sends acoustic energy into the earth. This energy is reflected from
subsurface layers and recorded at the surface with instruments (geophones or
receivers) used to transform seismic energy into electrical impulses. The data
collected are then processed by computer to create an image of the subsurface
geology.
The proposed 3-D survey requires the deployment of motion sensing
devices (geophones or receivers), which will be deployed at regular intervals
(220 feet) with spacing between receiver lines of 1320 feet. The survey design
will also incorporate an energy source that will be placed at regular intervals in a
bricked pattern. The charge depth and configuration proposed for lands within
the project area consist of single 80-foot holes drilled at intervals of 220 feet
along each source line. Source line spacing is 1760 feet. Each source location
will be loaded with a 5.5-pound charge of Pentolite, and the hole will be plugged
in accordance with Texas Rule 100 for the prevention of co-mingling of surface
water and ground water. Approximately 47.62 miles of receiver lines (1143
receiver points) and 36.08 linear miles of source lines (866 source points) are
located within the Sam Houston National Forest. The diameter of the drill holes
will be four inches. The locations of source points and receiver points are
depicted on the enclosed maps. New Century Exploration, Inc. will offset source
points away from all known prehistoric sites, historic sites, and cemeteries to
prevent negative impacts to cultural resources. John E. Ippolito, Forest Service
Archaeologist, reviewed the project maps and determined that all compartments
involved in this project should be considered medium or high probability for the
presence of prehistoric or historic sites due to the proximity of the compartments
to the watersheds of Winters Bayou and the East Fork of the San Jacinto River.
Therefore, a cultural resources survey was performed prior to conducting
operations in these areas. The sites located as a result of these surveys were
avoided.

Geophysical surveying consisted of approximately four survey crews of
four persons marking the proposed sites for source holes and locations of
geophones. This was accomplished using hand-held Global Positioning System
(GPS) devices as well as inertial and conventional surveying methods. Hand
clearing of vegetation was necessary along source and receiver lines within
some portions of the project area. Clearing of vegetation was necessary to
obtain line-of-sight and/or allow for safe passage of crews. Vegetation consisted
of brush, small trees, and branches. This was accomplished through the use of
chainsaws or machetes. Cutting was limited to the minimum amount necessary
to accomplish the desired objectives.
Surveys for cultural resources and proposed, endangered, threatened,
and sensitive species were conducted in accordance with United States Forest
Service requirements along seismic lines in order to identify locations of these
resources that could potentially be impacted by drilling operations. Drilling
operations were offset for the protection of cultural resources and proposed,
endangered, threatened, and sensitive species.
Drilling will be accomplished using highland drilling rigs. Six to eight twoperson drilling crews will be utilized within the forest. During this phase of
operations, drillers will maneuver from source point to source point utilizing the
route of least resistance. No mechanized clearing will be conducted ahead of the
drilling equipment. Small trees and shrubs in the paths of the drills may be
impacted.
Drilling will be followed by recording operations. The recording crew will
consist of approximately 60 individuals. Recording operations will be supported
by helicopters to minimize impacts. Helicopters will lower cache bags containing
equipment along the receiver lines, and the recording crews will deploy this
equipment along the receiver lines. This equipment will consist of geophones,
cables, and data recording boxes. Once enough equipment is laid out to
complete a recording patch (approximately 18 lines), the recording crew will
begin detonating charges. The charge in each hole will be detonated one at a
time, and the resulting energy wave recorded. Crewmembers will travel
throughout the area, hook a shooting pack to each electronic detonating wire
(cap), and detonate each charge.
Project area clean up will be conducted in conjunction with drilling and
recording operations. After the recording is completed in each swath (area
between receiver lines), all equipment, trash, and flagging will be removed from
the area and placed in cache bags for removal by helicopter.

It is estimated that four to five months will be required to complete project
operations within the entire project area. Since the compartments in the Sam
Houston National Forest are spaced out over the project area, crews will likely be
present in localized work areas within the forest over the entire duration of project
operations. However, it is important to note that there will not be a constant
presence in any one area for the duration of the project. Drilling operations
typically progress from east to west or west to east. As lines are completed on
one side of the recording patch and equipment is picked up and moved to the
other side.
New Century Exploration, Inc. will coordinate with United States Forest
Service representatives to minimize interference with visitors and public use
areas within scenic areas. For example, source points were offset away from
trails, and helicopter use can be limited during periods of high visitor use. Project
impacts are expected to be minimal and temporary in nature.
