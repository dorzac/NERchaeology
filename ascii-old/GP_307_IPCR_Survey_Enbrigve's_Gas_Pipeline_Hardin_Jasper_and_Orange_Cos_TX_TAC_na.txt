ABSTRACT

Enbridge Pipelines (East Texas) L.P. (Enbridge) is proposing to construct a new 36-inch
intrastate natural gas pipeline that extends approximately 66.42 kilometers (41.27 miles) from
Enbridge’s meter facility near Kountze in Hardin County, Texas to various pipelines and end
users in Orange County, Texas. The Deep Clarity (DC) 36-inch Kountze to Orange (DC-36KO) pipeline route is generally designed to follow and parallel existing pipeline routes.
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), was contracted by URS Corporation,
Inc. to conduct a cultural resources survey of the proposed pipeline route. The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) is defined as the 120-meter (400-foot) wide study corridor, which includes a
15.25-meter (50-foot) permanent easement, a 30-meter (100-foot) wide temporary construction
right-of-way, and additional temporary workspace areas. HRA Gray & Pape and URS
Corporation, in consultation with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the
Texas Historical Commission (THC), developed a work plan designed to concentrate survey
efforts in areas assumed to contain the highest potential for identifying intact, buried cultural
resources. Fieldwork was conducted between October 2006 and March 2007. This work was
conducted to satisfy requirements set forth by the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
All work was conducted following accepted standards set forth by the THC and the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA). The project is located entirely on privately owned properties,
therefore, it did not require a Texas Antiquities Permit.
This report presents the results of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey of
29.61 kilometers (18.40 miles) of the proposed 66.42-kilometer (41.27-mile) DC-36-KO
pipeline route. Total acreage surveyed along the proposed pipeline route equals 328.42 hectares
(811.58 acres), which includes several areas considered to have a low probability for containing
cultural resources. In addition to proposed pipeline route coverage, a total of 95.11 hectares
(235.02 acres) were surveyed along portions of former pipeline alignment. For this project, the
combined area surveyed along proposed and former pipeline alignments consists of 423.55
hectares (1046.58 acres).
As a result of archaeological investigations along the proposed DC-36-KO pipeline,
three newly identified cultural resources were recorded. These include an historic railroad
berm, trestle bridge, and associated facilities, designated Site 41HN51, an historic cow
dipping vat (Historic Structure A), and one prehistoric buried lithic scatter, assigned Site
41HN52. Due to a reroute of the proposed pipeline, Historic Structure A will not be affected.
HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work at Historic Structure A or prehistoric Site
41HN52. HRA Gray & Pape recommends National Register eligibility testing or avoidance
of Site 41HN51. During pipeline construction, Enbridge plans to avoid this resource by
boring under the site. Enbridge has agreed to place a fence around the perimeter of the site
boundary during the excavation of the bore pits and pipe installation. If Enbridge determines
that a travel lane across the site is necessary, timber mats will be placed over the site to avoid
any adverse effects.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Between October 2006 and Mach 2007, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape),
of Houston, Texas, at the request of URS Corporation, Inc. (URS), under contract with
Enbridge Pipelines (East Texas) L.P. (Enbridge), conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological investigation on approximately 29.61 kilometers (18.40 miles) of the 66.42kilometer (41.27-mile) proposed pipeline route for the Deep Clarity (DC) 36-inch Kountze to
Orange (DC-36-KO) natural gas pipeline project in Hardin, Jasper, and Orange counties,
Texas. This project was conducted in order to comply with United States Corps of Engineers
(USACE) permitting requirements.
Enbridge Pipelines (East Texas) L.P. (Enbridge) is proposing to construct a new 36inch intrastate natural gas pipeline that extends approximately 66.42 kilometers (41.27 miles)
from Enbridge’s meter facility near Kountze in Hardin County, Texas to various pipelines
and end users in Orange County, Texas. The DC-36-KO pipeline route is generally designed
to follow and parallel existing pipeline routes.
The permanent easement that will be acquired is standardized at 15.25 meters (50
feet) in width. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of a 120-meter (400-foot) wide
study corridor, which includes the permanent easement, a 30-meter (100-foot) wide
temporary construction right of way (ROW), and additional temporary workspace areas. It is
unlikely that historic resources will be affected by below ground pipeline construction, but
above ground markers or other pipeline infrastructure can result in viewshed-related
concerns. Therefore, the APE for above ground resources included properties immediately
adjacent to the archaeological APE.
HRA Gray & Pape and URS, in consultation with the USACE and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), developed a work plan designed to concentrate survey efforts
in areas assumed to contain the highest potential for identifying intact, buried cultural
resources. These areas are known as high probability areas (HPAs). According to this plan,
only HPAs were subjected to field investigation, although low potential areas were surveyed
as well, either while in transit between high potential areas or in an effort to verify the site
location model. Agency concurrence with this plan was received prior to fieldwork
mobilization (Appendix A). The project is located entirely on privately owned properties,
therefore, it did not require a Texas Antiquities Permit.
This work was conducted to satisfy requirements set forth by 33 CFR Part 325,
Appendix C - Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties. This Appendix
establishes the procedures to be followed by the USACE to fulfill the requirements set forth
in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA). The goals of the
cultural resources survey were to determine if land altering activities required to complete
this project would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE

106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800),
and to establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within
the project’s APE. Fieldwork and reporting activities were conducted following accepted
standards set forth by the THC and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).
Approximately 29.61 kilometers (18.40 miles) of proposed pipeline route have been
surveyed. The width of the study corridor varied between 120 meters (400 feet) and 60
meters (200 feet) depending on a number of factors for total acreage coverage of
approximately 328.42 hectares (811.58 acres) of proposed pipeline route, which includes all
areas considered to have a high probability for containing cultural resources as well as
several low probability areas. In addition to proposed pipeline route coverage, a total of
95.11 hectares (235.02 acres) were surveyed along portions of former pipeline alignment.
For this project, the combined area surveyed along proposed and former pipeline alignments
consists of 423.55 hectares (1046.58 acres).

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The project area is located on the Kountze Southwest, Kountze South, Silsbee,
Evadale, Gist, Pine Forest, and Texla United States Geologic Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle maps in Hardin, Jasper, and Orange counties, Texas (Figure 1). The
western half of the pipeline route is generally oriented west to east, while the eastern half is
generally oriented in a northwest to southeast direction. The environment consists primarily
of timber farms, agricultural land, and some marsh. The Neches River is the largest natural
waterway that crosses the proposed route, however, several large creeks and minor drainages
also bisect the proposed DC-36-KO pipeline route.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT
This report is organized into seven numbered chapters and two lettered appendices.
Chapter I provides an overview of the project and summarizes the results of the
archaeological investigation. Chapter II presents an overview of the environmental setting
and geomorphology of the project area. Chapter III presents a discussion of the cultural
context associated with the project area, with particular attention placed on those cultural
periods represented by archaeological sites in Hardin, Jasper, and Orange counties. Chapter

CHAPTER II. GEOMORPHOLOGY AND SOILS

As part of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, the environmental setting of the region is a
combination of flat coastal zones and slightly rolling inlands set between eastern woodlands
and western prairies (Finneman 1938). The entire area is associated with creeks, agricultural
fields, marshlands, and urban or otherwise developed properties. Dunes, ridges, and incised
stream channels break the flat topography of the coast, while upland terraces are at times
dotted with natural sand mounds. The climate is mild with hot summers and warm winters
with the occasional cold front bringing temperatures to around freezing. The region includes
many vegetation zones. Those near the coast contain marsh, shortgrasses, and water-tolerant
trees, while those further inland may include oak savannas, prairies, mixed hardwoods, and
dense pines (Jones 1983).

PHYSIOGRAPHIC AND GEOLOGIC SETTING
The project is located in the Western Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas. The Geologic Atlas
of Texas, Beaumont sheet, shows the sediments underlying the proposed DC-36-KO project
area consist of Eocene, Miocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene deposits (University of Texas
Bureau of Economic Geology [UT-BEG] 1992). The proposed project corridor extends from
southeast to northwest across Hardin, Jasper, and Orange counties. The southern portion of
the pipeline is situated in an area of younger, Pleistocene deposits whereas the northern
portion of the pipeline is situated in an area of older, Eocene deposits. The oldest deposits in
the project area are Miocene deposits including the Catahoula formation. The Catahoula
Formation consists of mudstone and sand, with some quartz sand.
The proposed pipeline crosses the Sabine and Neches Rivers. This river is composed
of Quaternary Alluvium deposits. The Deweyville Formation of Late Pleistocene or
Holocene age outcrops along most of the Quaternary Alluvium. Between the Sabine and
Neches Rivers, the remainder of the project area is underlain by the Beaumont Formation
(UT-BEG 1992).
The Lissie Formation underlies the bulk of the project area west and south of the
Quaternary Alluvium along the western bank of the Neches River. Quaternary Alluvium
underlies portions of this area along Village Creek and tends to be associated with
backswamp, coastal marshes, and stream channels (UT-BEG 1982).
Quaternary Alluvium is composed of clay, silt, sand and local organic matter. The
Deweyville Formation is composed of silt, sand, clay and gravels. Within the project area,
the Beaumont Formation is dominated by clay and sand. All of the sediments are deposits of
fluvial systems or coastal plains ascribed to depositional conditions influenced by the
combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the
5

continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the
region’s rivers (Van Siclen 1991; Kane 1963; Fisher et al. 1973). As the sea level began to
rise with the retreat of the Late Wisconsin ice sheet, shoreline progradation and alluviation
resulted in valley filling of the Sabine River, closing the southern portion of the valley and
forming Sabine Lake.

SOILS
A review of the National Resources Conservation Service website indicates that the
proposed DC-36-KO pipeline route traverses eleven soil map units in Hardin County, five
soil map units in Jasper County, and six soil map units in Orange County (Soil Survey Staff,
Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture [SSS
NRCS USDA] 2005). The primary soil associations in Hardin County include Dallardsville
and Caneyhead. The Dallardsville soil series are very deep and moderately well drained.
They formed in loamy sediments from the Lissie Formation. Dallardsville series are on
oblong mounds in coastal plains areas. These mounds have a slope of zero to one percent.
The Caneyhead series is also very deep, but very poorly drained. These soils formed in
loamy alluvium of the Quaternary age. Caneyhead series soils are nearly level (zero to one
percent slope) and are found in open ended depressions on terrace treads of river valleys.
Iron concretions are present in both series. Minor soil associations in Hardin County include
Otanya, Nona, Votaw, Silsbee, Belrose, Plank, Kenefick, Spurger, and Kirbyville. All of
these are either loam or very fine sand (SSS NRCS USDA 2005).
Five soil associations are found in Jasper County and include Evadale, SpurgerMollville, Waller-Evadale, Urbo, Mantachie (SSS NRCS USDA 2005). The Evadale series
are very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Late
Pleistocene age. Today they are part of the flat coastal plains. Slope can range from zero to
one percent, but most are less than one percent. Evadale soils are often saturated during cool
times of the year and crawfish bioturbation is common. Soil textures range from loam to
clay, with clay percentages increasing with depth. The Spurger-Mollville association is deep,
loamy, moderately drained soil that formed in clayey and sandy alluvium. These gently
sloping (zero to five percent) soils are found on terraces that formed during the Late
Pleistocene age, and today are present on broad areas above the flood plains of major rivers.
Soil textures range from loam to clay to sandy clay to sand, with iron depletions and
accumulations present throughout. The Waller-Evadale association consists of very deep,
poorly drained, slowly permeable soils. These nearly level upland soils have formed in loamy
sediments of early to mid Pleistocene age, and are saturated from November to March.
Slopes range from zero to one percent. Soil textures range from loam to clay loam, with iron
manganese concretions throughout. The Waller-Evadale soils also have high frequency of
crawfish krotovinas. The Urbo and Mantachie series consist of deep, somewhat poorly
drained soils. These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in clayey alluvium on flood
plains of streams that drain uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain and Blackland Prairie
Major Land Resource Areas. They are often flooded, have high water tables in winter and
late spring, and are cut by old stream channels and sloughs. Sloping ranges from zero to

6

three percent. Iron and manganese concretions are present throughout (SSS NRCS USDA
2005).
There are three soil associations that are found in Orange County. These include the
Mollco, Texla-Evadale, and Orcadia-Anahuac soils (SSS NRCS USDA 2005). The Mollco
association consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils
that formed in loamy sediments. These soils are in depressions on nearly level uplands of
Pleistocene age. The soil formed in relic depressional channels of loamy strandplain
sediments associated with barrier island and beach deposits of the Beaumont Formation.
Slopes are less than one percent. Soil textures range from fine sandy loam to sandy clay
loam. Mollco soils have low iron concretions. These soils are normally ponded during
winter and early spring. The Texla-Evadale association consists of very deep, somewhat
poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy and clayey
sediments on nearly level uplands of Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from zero to one percent.
Soil texture varies from silt loam to silty clay loam to clay. Texla-Evadale soils can be
saturated for more than thirty days during late winter or early spring. Orcadia-Anahuac
association consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils.
These soils formed in loamy and clayey sediments on nearly level uplands of Pleistocene
age. Orcadia-Anahuac soils are on the Coast Prairie east of the Trinity River. The soils
formed in clayey and loamy sediments of the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age. Slope
ranges from zero to two percent. Soil texture ranges from silt loam to silty clay loam to clay,
with iron accumulations throughout. These soils are saturated below surface for a period of
thirty days or more in most years, and, in some years, these soils have aquic conditions (SSS
NRCS USDA 2005).

CHAPTER III. CULTURE HISTORY

Most of the prehistoric cultural resources located near the coast between the Brazos
River and Sabine Lake consist of shell middens found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks
along streams (Aten 1983; Patterson 1985). These middens usually contain faunal material
as well as cultural remains such as lithic tools and pottery. Inland sites are less likely to
consist of middens and are more similar to generalized open campsites. Sites of this type
consist of little to no stratification due to a short occupation time, erosion, and land clearing.
Thus, subsurface features are rare (USACE 1999). In both areas, sites are most often found
near stream channels.

PREHISTORY
A cultural sequence of the Southeast Texas region is based on lithics and ceramics
and the cultural context is described by Aten (1983), Story (1990), and Ricklis (2004). This
information is merged with the archaeological data here to give a complete picture of life on
the Upper Texas Coast.
Along the Upper Texas Coast, the Paleoindian period begins around 12,000–11,500
B.P. and ends near 9,000-8,000 B.P. (Aten 1983; Story 1990; Ricklis 2004). This period,
characterized by Clovis and Folsom fluted projectile points, is poorly represented in the
archaeological record for the region (Aten 1983) and no intact sites for this period have been
verified (Ricklis 2004). Isolated artifacts include Clovis, Folsom, San Patrice, Plainview,
Angostura, and Scottsbluff point types (Aten 1983; Story 1990; Turner and Hester 1993;
Ricklis 2004). Sites from the earlier portion of the Paleoindian time period that would today
be found located on shoreline would have been initially situated on tributary stream
drainages at a time when the sea level was lower (Ricklis 2004). Subsistence during the
Paleoindian stage included both hunting and gathering although there was probably an
emphasis on hunting. The quality of lithic material used to make artifacts and the scarcity of
those materials in Southeast Texas suggests a highly mobile Paleo population (Ricklis 2004)
moving in relation to available food sources.
The Transitional Archaic period begins about 9,000 B.P. and ends around 7,500 B.P.
(Aten 1983; Story 1990). This stage is also poorly represented in southeast Texas, but
isolated Keithville, Neches River, and Trinity dart points are attributed to this time period
(Story 1990; Turner and Hester 1993; Ricklis 2004). Diet begins a slow shift towards plant
processing in the Archaic, but still includes hunting. Plant processing technology seen
during the Archaic period includes stone lined hearths and baking pits as well as milling tools
(Story 1990). Groups appear to have reduced foraging distance though continued a strict
seasonal round. Population density appears to have risen during the period.

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

Beginning at 7,500 B.P. and spanning 2,500 years (Aten 1983), the Early Archaic
period in this region is not well documented. The sites may have been destroyed or deeply
buried (Aten 1983; Story 1990). Dart points characteristic of this stage include Bell/Calf
Creek, Tortugas, and Wells types (Ricklis 2004).
The Middle Archaic period (5,000 to 3,000 B.P.) reveals the earliest surviving shell
middens (Aten 1983). These middens contain remains of shellfish, such as oysters and
estuarine clams, faunal material from terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, and the earliest
known human burials in the region (Aten 1983). Characteristic projectile points include
Yarbrough, Travis, Pedernales, and Bulverde types (Story 1990; Turner and Hester 1993;
Ricklis 2004).
The Late Archaic lasted from 3,000 to 2,000 B.P. and shows evidence for population
increase (Aten 1983). By 2500 B.P., the climate in this area was essentially modern. Ground
stone artifacts made from materials from southwestern Arkansas and found in context with
human burials in cemeteries such as the Ernest Witte Site indicate the possibility of trade
(Hall 1981) but the shift to the use of more poor-quality local materials suggests less mobility
(Ricklis 2004). Projectile points in this period are corner-notched or expanding-stemmed
forms, such as the Kent and Gary types (Story 1990, Turner and Hester 1993), along with the
Ensor and Godley points found in the western extremities of Southeast Texas (Ricklis 2004).
During the late Archaic, more utilitarian biface tools are prevalent as well as are bone tools.
Late Archaic assemblages are very similar to the early part of the Late Prehistoric stage
(Aten 1983).
The transition from the Late Archaic stage to the Prehistoric is indicated by the
introduction of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983), moving first into the coastal
region and eventually disseminating inland (Ricklis 2004). No major shifts in lifestyle
during this period from the Late Archaic are evident (Ricklis 2004) although there were
major technological changes, such as sandy paste ceramics and, around 700 A.D., in the Late
Prehistoric period, the bow and arrow (Story 1990; Ricklis 2004). Ceramics have been
arranged into broad time intervals by Ricklis (2004), starting with the Early Ceramic around
100 A.D. and ending with the Early Historic at 1800 A.D. Characteristic projectile points are
light, small, straight and expanded stem types that include the Delhi, Ellis, Epps, Gary, Kent,
Alba, Catahoula, Cliffton, Fresno, Friley, Hayes, Perdiz, Scallorn, and Steiner points (Story
1990; Turner and Hester 1993; Ricklis 2004).
The Attakapans lived along the Lower Neches and Sabine rivers between the San
Jacinto River in Texas and Vermillion Bay, Louisiana. The Attakapans lived in five bands
that roamed the border areas between Texas and Louisiana. These five bands were known as
Vermilion Bayou, Mermentau, Calcasieu, Sabine and Neches, and Trinity (Williams 1986).
Several Texas tribes living along the Trinity River interacted with the Attakapans, including
the Orocoquisas, Deadoes, and Bidais. The main difference between these tribes appeared to
be dialect. Culturally, these groups appeared to be very similar to the Europeans at contact.
In fact, eighteenth century Spanish accounts used the tribal names Attakapans and
Orocoquisas interchangeably (Kleiner 2002).

HARDIN COUNTY
Hardin County, Texas is known for both its location in the “Big Thicket” area of the
state and for the healing qualities of Sour Lake. While land was granted for settlement in
1829, population in the area remained low until 1858 when Hardin County was officially
established (Duncan 2006). Named to honor the Hardin family of Liberty County, the
county seat was also named “Hardin”. The county seat was changed to the City of Kountze
after the Sabine and East Texas Railway Company by-passed the City of Hardin and the
county courthouse burned in 1886 (Duncan 2006).
Prior to the Civil War, the residents of Hardin County had challenging lives. There
was little industry in the county, and most of the residents were subsistence farmers rather
than cash-crop agriculturists. At this time, residents of Hardin County elected both slave
owners and non-slave owners to public office (Duncan 2006). The residents of Hardin
County did vote to succeed during the Civil War and many residents fought for the
Confederate Army at this time (Duncan 2006).
While Hardin County did experience some growth in the late nineteenth century, this
growth was halted with the onset of the Great Depression. Subsistence agriculture was still a
way of life in the county until some residents became involved with the lumber industry in
the beginning of the twentieth century (Duncan 2006). In 1903, the Sour Lake oil field began
producing oil; the Texas Oil Company (Texaco) drilled its first successful well in Hardin
County (Duncan 2006). In the latter part of the twentieth century, population in Hardin
County increased to levels similar to the present.

JASPER COUNTY
According to Spanish travelers in the sixteenth century, the first prehistoric
inhabitants of Jasper County were traditional hunter-gatherers, and included the Ais and
Atakapa Indians. The Ais (part of the Caddo confederacy) were located between the Neches
and Sabine rivers with the Atakapa inhabiting the southern parts of the county. The Biloxi
Indians also settled along the Neches River where they founded three villages. The Spanish
were the first Europeans in the area but were quickly followed by French and English
travelers. Early maps indicate that the return trip of the 1542 Moscoso expedition may have
passed through Jasper County (McReynolds 1968).
The eighteenth century gave rise to brief agriculture by English explorers and some of
the first land disputes (between the French and Spanish) in the area that would later become
known as Jasper County. The first land grant was awarded to John R. Bevil near the county
seat of Jasper in the 1830s. The grant became known as Bevilport, an important port for
river-navigation between 1830 and 1860. Around the same time Lorenzo de Zavalaqv
obtained a Mexican empressarial grant covering the majority of present day Jasper County.

Jasper County was formally established in the Convention of 1836 and in the
following year the county boundaries were clearly defined. The same year as the Convention
saw the establishment of the town of Jasper as the county seat. Jasper County was split in
1846 with the eastern portion becoming Newton County. A fire in 1849 destroyed the Jasper
County courthouse and all county records (McReynolds 1968).
River transportation played a major role in the growth of Jasper County by aiding in
the distribution of large harvests from agricultural crops. At the same time the county’s
lumber industry began in Ford’s Bluff (currently known as Evadale) with the construction of
the county’s first steam sawmill. Around this time the U.S. census tallied the population at
1,767, thirty percent of whom were slaves.
Before the onset of the Civil War, Jasper County contained 275,000 acres of farmland
divided between 250 farms most being smaller than 500 acres. Again the census showed a
population of 4,037 with thirty-nine percent being slaves. Records indicate the county
harvest increased as well with large numbers of cattle and sheep (McReynolds 1968).
There was slow economic growth between 1860 and 1880. Cotton became an
important commodity after the war despite the decreasing size of local farms. Jasper County
experienced an increase and diversification in land acreage and livestock, as cattle ranching
became a larger contributor of the local economy and the growth of the timber industry
during the 1880s. The timber industry directly affected the population growth at the turn of
the twentieth century doubling from 7,138 to 14,000 (McReynolds 1968).
The Great Depression affected Jasper County with high unemployment and a decline
in industrial establishments. Federal assistance in the form of projects such as the JasperNewton Electrical Cooperative, which brought electricity to the area, helped in some ways.
The county ceased cotton production in the 1940s in favor of the local agricultural and
lumber industries. Highway development helped to bolster the economy and benefited the
lumber industry (McReynolds 1968).
Though first tapped in 1928, oil was finally utilized in an effort to stabilize the
economy around the 1950s. Water became an important resource with the construction of
the Sam Rayburn Reservoir (fed by the Angelina River) in the mid-1960s. The exploitation
of oil and water helped Jasper County reach a population of 31,102 in the 1990s.

ORANGE COUNTY
Archaeological evidence found in Orange County, Texas suggests the area was first
inhabited 12,000-15,000 years ago. Additional evidence shows that by the time of European
contact, the Attakapans had become established in the area. The Attakapans began to
disappear from the Orange County, Texas region in the mid-to late 1700s, most likely due to
advance into the area by the Spanish and French. By 1785, the Orange County courthouse
records made no mention of any Attakapans living in the Sabine and Neches river regions or
around Sabine Lake (Williams 1986).

The first Europeans to visit Orange County, Texas were the Spanish. In 1519, Alonso
Alvarez de Pineda sailed from Florida to chart the Gulf Coast. Pineda named the Sabine
River after cypress trees he discovered in the area (Mason 2002). In 1528, another Spaniard,
Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca was shipwrecked in the Texas Gulf Coast region. Cabeza de
Vaca spent six years traveling around the Texas coast area as a captive of the Attakapans
Indians. The French established a permanent presence in the Texas Gulf Coast region in
1685, when Robert Sieur de la Salle established a French colony and fort at Matagorda Bay,
Texas. For the next six months, La Salle explored the area including Orange County, Texas
on his way towards the Rio Grande River. Once the Spanish heard French explorers had
entered East Texas, they began to erect missions in the area. In 1690, the Spanish built the
San Francisco de los Tejas mission on the upper Neches River (Williams 1986).
Throughout the rest of the 1600s and into the 1700s, both the French and Spanish
continued to explore and contest control over the East Texas area. The French continued to
send traders into East Texas, establishing command over nearly all trade in the area by 1751.
The Spanish continued to construct missions as a response to French trading. By 1774, the
British sent explorers to the Texas Gulf Coast region. Two known British expeditions took
place in 1777, one involving the British surveying sloop Florida that mapped Sabine Lake
and the other apparently ending in shipwreck at the mouth of the Neches River (Williams
1986).
Following a series of events including the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the War of 1812,
and Mexican Independence in 1821, Americans saw Texas as new frontier to be settled. In
1821, Texas became part of the Republic of Mexico. By 1825, Texas had adopted
colonization laws and began issuing land grants. Soon after, several Americans purchased
grants from the Mexican government and moved into the Orange County, Texas area (Mason
2002).
In 1837, the US Government mapped and removed debris along Sabine Lake and the
Sabine River (Mason 2002). Soon after, the first steamboat to navigate up the Sabine River
brought goods from other coastal cities. With this voyage, the Velocipede ushered in the
steamboat era that would last until the start of the Civil War. Between 1838-1852, several
licenses were issued to ferry operators who started ferry lines between many of the bayous
and rivers in the region (Williams 1986).
In 1852, Orange County was organized. By 1858, the county seat was located in newly
incorporated Orange, Texas. By this time, Orange was a well-developed town known as the
"Gateway to Texas." The town boasted 52 families, several businesses, two schools, two
shipyards, four sawmills, a courthouse, and a jail. The Texas and New Orleans Railroad was
in operation in the area, with Orange depot hosting trains three days per week (Williams
1986).
On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, Orange County, Texas was home to 1,277 residents
and 282 slaves. During the war, the residents of Orange County supported the Confederacy,
with the men serving in Company B of the Fourth Mounted Volunteers of Sibley's Brigade,
the Second Brigade of Texas State Troops, the Thirteenth Texas Cavalry, and the Twenty12

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

First Texas Cavalry. Orange County also operated a Coast Guard to facilitate blockade
running in the Sabine-Neches areas (Williams 1986).
Orange County, Texas emerged from the Civil War mostly intact. However, five
months later, a major hurricane struck the town nearly wiping it out. By 1870, the county
population stood at 1,255. In 1876, the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, which had ceased
operation at the start of the Civil War, reopened in Orange County. Also in 1876, the
Lutcher-Moore Lumber Company came to Orange County, fueling rebirth of the area. By
1880, Orange County boasted a population of 2,938. In 1881, the Southern Pacific Railroad
came to Orange, forming a direct route from San Francisco to New Orleans. Shipbuilding
also thrived in the county helping make Orange a major transportation center (Mason 2002).
The Orange Rice Mill opened in 1901 and, in 1904, the Yell Mill (the only mill in the
world to use yellow pine shavings as a raw product) opened in the county. By 1904, the
population numbered nearly 6,000 people. The early twentieth century was further
characterized by growth once oil was discovered at the Bland well in 1913 and the Oscar
Chesson well in 1922. By that time, Orange County was home to over 15,000 residents and
thirty-two oil processing plants and refineries (Mason 2002).
The Great Depression of the 1930s hit Orange County hard. The population remained
stable in the area (15,000 residents in 1930 to 17,000 in 1940), but work was scarce. In
1900, plants in Orange employed over 4,000 workers, but in 1930, that number dropped to
938. World War II defense needs fueled an Orange County recovery. Shipbuilding
rebounded as the war ensued and chemical and petrochemical plants located in the area.
Dupont moved to Orange in 1944, as did Allied, Spencer, Firestone, and Goodrich-Gulf. By
1950, the population of Orange County reached over 40,000. As of 1990, over 80,000 people
lived in Orange County, Texas with the majority residing in the cities or Orange, Vidor,
Bridge City, West Orange, and Pinehurst (Mason 2002).

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Several archaeological investigations have been conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1mile) radius of the DC-36-KO study corridor. These previous cultural resource surveys are
documented on the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, an online resource maintained by the
THC. Unfortunately, only limited information is available regarding each previously
conducted survey. This information is discussed below.
Texas A&M University conducted the earliest surveys in the Big Thicket National
Preserve (BTNP) in Hardin County, within the current project area (Shafer et al. 1975;
Baxter et al. 1975). These surveys were conducted in 1975 on behalf of the United States
Forest Service. It is unclear how much area these surveys covered, although, combined they
resulted in the identification of 19 new prehistoric sites and two new historic sites. Of these,
two sites (41JP8 and 41JP61) are located within the project study radius (Table 1).
In 1988, the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT)
conducted a survey of 51.50 kilometers (32 miles) within 36.57 to 91.44 meters (120-300
feet) of proposed ROW. This survey was conducted in Hardin and Jasper Counties and did
not result in the identification of any new cultural resources (SDHPT 1988).
In 1993, The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) surveyed a portion of
Farm to Market (FM) Road 105 for a length of 2.90 kilometers (1.8 miles) and within 36.57
meters (120 feet) of ROW proposed for widening. The survey did not result in the
identification of any new archaeological sites of historic standing structures (TxDOT 1993).
Blanton & Associates, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of 193.03
hectares (477 acres) owned by the BTNP for proposed seismic source lines. The survey was
conducted across 48.28 kilometers (30 miles) of the BTNP within a 30-meter (100-foot)
survey corridor. A total of 10 new and previously recorded sites were visited. Of these, two
sites were prehistoric and eight sites were modern or historic. Of the newly recorded sites,
three of them (41HN38, 41HN39, and 41HN42) were considered potentially eligible for
National Register status. The seismic source lines were re-located to avoid these sites
(Brown et al. 1999).
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. completed an intensive pedestrian survey in
2001 of 66.3 kilometers (41.2 miles) for the Centennial Pipeline project in Jefferson, Orange,
Jasper, and Newton Counties (Brownlow 2001). The survey resulted in the identification of
three new prehistoric sites, and one historic site (41OR86). Site 41OR86 is located within
1.6-kilometers (1 miles) of the proposed undertaking. Details about this site are provided in
Table 1.

The most recent survey documented on the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas was
conducted in 2001. Parsons, Brinkerhoff, Quade, and Douglas, Inc. completed a survey
along the US Highway 69 corridor covering 212.46 hectares (525 acres). The survey resulted
in the identification of one new prehistoric site and two historic sites. None of these are
located within 1.6 kilometers (1mile) of the proposed project.

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Using cultural resources data maintained by the Texas Archaeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the THC library in Austin, and the online Texas Archaeological Sites
Atlas, and in consultation with the THC and the USACE, a site location model was prepared for
the APE and its immediate environs that focused on physiographic and other significant
characteristics. After the locations of known cultural resources were plotted, additional factors
such as distance to water, landform type, and soil type, among other parameters, were included
to refine the site location model. This site location model was used to stratify the study corridor
into zones of probability for site location and to guide survey efforts while in the field.
Using Geographical Information System (GIS) software, a “sensitivity buffer zone”
around creek crossings and previously identified sites was created to determine HPAs; typically
these zones included areas located between 200 and 250 meters (656 and 820 feet) from either
side of water ways and existing archaeological sites. HPAs include those that are situated near a
supply of natural resources (such as fresh water), or situated on well-drained soils of elevated
topographic settings. The proposed survey strategy entailed surveying primarily only HPAs,
although some low probability areas (LPAs) were also surveyed in an effort to test the site
location model. This strategy allowed the survey crew to concentrate their efforts on areas
most likely to contain intact, significant buried resources. Previously completed surveys and
linear pipeline studies in east and southeast Texas have successfully utilized this strategy in
the past (Brownlow 2001; Nash 1995) or have resulted in evidence that supports the validity
of this model (Cliff and Hunt 1995; Dixon et al. 1997; Hughey et al. 2004; Hughey and
Picklesimer 2004; Turner and Hughey 2006a and 2006b). On November 27, 2006, the THC
concurred with the proposed survey strategy and site location model for this project
(Appendix A).
While in the field, these HPA zones were verified; if field observations suggested that
these zones should be extended to include additional high potential landforms, additional
areas were investigated. Likewise, field verification allowed for certain suspected HPAs to
be surveyed by reconnaissance if evidence of prior disturbance, the presence of saturated
soils, excessive slope, or other factors were noted.
Per THC guidelines, minimum standards for surface reconnaissance and subsurface
testing on linear projects call for 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1 mile), within a 100-foot
(30-meter) wide corridor. The survey strategy developed for this project surpasses these
minimum requirements, while focusing survey efforts on sections of the proposed route that
contain the highest potential for discovering buried resources. Investigation consisted of a
combination of reconnaissance (surface) survey and intensive pedestrian (subsurface) survey.
Subsurface testing consisted of the placement of a series of 30-centimeter by 30-centimeter
(12-inch by 12-inch) shovel tests within all undisturbed HPAs located in the study corridor.
Sections of the study corridor falling within HPAs were tested at an interval between 30 and
16

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

60 meters (100 and 200 feet). Vertical control was maintained by excavating each shovel test
in arbitrary 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. One wall of each shovel test was profiled and the
walls and floor of each shovel test were inspected for color or texture change potentially
associated with the presence of cultural features. Whenever possible, shovel tests were
excavated into sterile subsoil, and soils were screened through ¼-inch wire mesh; soils with
high clay content were hand sorted.
Once a buried resource was located, an attempt was made to define its boundaries.
Additional delineation shovel tests were excavated in four radiating directions in intervals
between 10 and 30 meters (33 and 100 feet) within the confines of the study corridor. In
general, two sterile shovel tests were used to define a site’s size and location. At a minimum,
between six and eight delineation shovel tests were excavated unless surrounding landforms
or topography suggested the presence of a natural site boundary.
When encountered, standing structures immediately adjacent to the study corridors
that appeared to be 50 years in age or older were photographed during the survey and their
locations plotted on field maps with Global Positioning System (GPS) points collected.
General characteristics of each resource were noted on standardized forms.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Background and site file research was conducted prior to fieldwork mobilization.
The background literature search included a review of both archaeological site files and
architectural resource files, and a review of previously conducted cultural resource surveys in
the vicinity of the proposed project. This information was obtained by reviewing records
through the on-line Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, maintained by the THC.
Site file research was performed in order to identify all previously recorded
archaeological sites within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius extending 0.8 kilometers (0.50
miles) from each side of the proposed pipeline centerline, and all recorded historic structures
eligible for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing located adjacent to the
project APE. A series of tables was created to document the collected data, which include site
number, site name, site type, USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle map name, site size, cultural
affiliation, and NRHP status. The location of these previous cultural resource management
(CRM) project areas were plotted on copies of relevant topographic maps, and photocopies were
made of the pertinent portions of previous investigation reports.
Site file research was used to provide a historic context to the archaeological survey,
and additional documentary research was conducted in order to provide an understanding of
the development and history of the APE, the surrounding area, and southeast Texas in
general. This research then was used to prepare an overview history of the area, and
provided an understanding of the contextual framework of prehistory and history in Hardin,
Jasper, and Orange counties.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Approximately 29.61 kilometers (18.40 miles) of proposed pipeline route have been
surveyed; with total acreage coverage of approximately 328.42 hectares (811.58 acres) of
proposed pipeline route. The width of the study corridor varies between 120 meters (400
feet) and 60 meters (200 feet) depending on topography, disturbances, and other factors. In
addition to proposed pipeline route coverage, a total of 95.11 hectares (235.02 acres) were
surveyed along portions of former pipeline alignment (Figures 2-9). For this project, the
combined area surveyed along proposed and former pipeline alignments consists of 423.55
hectares (1046.58 acres).
Survey efforts resulted in the identification three previously unrecorded cultural
resources located within the project’s study corridor (Figures 3 and 4). The results of survey are
provided below.

RESULTS OF LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH
No previously recorded significant historic structures appearing to be 50 years in age
or older were encountered. Site file review indicated that five previously identified
archaeological sites and three historical markers are located within the study radius (Figures
2-9). Table 1 presents a list of these sites and historical markers. With the exception of Site
41HN9, none of these were located in close proximity to the study corridor (see Figure 3).
Information gathered from the Texas Archaeological Site Form for previously recorded Site
41HN9 indicated that the site was composed of a surface scatter of prehistoric artifacts
including lithic cores and debitage across a 200-meter (656-foot) swath of land that has been
exposed as a result of truck driving.

RESULTS OF INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
During these surveys, numerous factors affected the survey coverage of each HPA.
Generally, four transects were surveyed across the 120-meter (400-foot) study corridor with
shovel tests placed approximately 60 meters (200 feet) apart. Variations in topography, landuse, and soil morphology affected this approach. In particular, portions along the northwest
part of the proposed DC-36-KO pipeline are currently used for pine timber farming. In these
areas, there are extensive disturbances to the ground surface and below to approximately one
meter (3.28 feet) in depth. These disturbances are recognizable as deep furrows used to plant
rows of pine trees.
In other areas, field verification of HPAs resulted in the reduction or expansion of
linear coverage based on observed changes in topography and environmental conditions such
as inundation. In addition, some areas did not require shovel testing or survey along all four
transects. In these instances, no fewer than two transects were surveyed due to the proximity
of existing pipelines, commercial or residential development, wetlands, very shallow
Holocene soils with excellent ground visibility, or slopes exceeding twenty percent.
Several locations (HPA5, HPA 6 Reroute A, and HPA 7 Reroute A) were inundated
with water levels exceeding one meter (3 feet) in depth (see Figures 6 and 7). During
additional survey efforts, these areas were re-assessed on several occasions spanning from
the beginning of October 2006 to the end of February 2007. As a result of each mobilization,
these areas have been consistently underwater. Despite the water level, during each
mobilization, field crews conducted a walkover survey and visual inspection of these areas
where water did not exceed waist level. Based on field observations, it was noted that these
areas contained Cypress trees, palmetto plants and/or tall marsh grasses, and rarely contained
other tree varieties such as Pine or Oak trees. Photographs of some of these areas are
provided below in Plates 1 and 2.
In addition, survey was conducted within HPA2 on the original proposed pipeline
route that has been abandoned. This area was heavily inundated during the initial survey.
The proposed pipeline route has been shifted east (see Figure 8). Although the area is still
defined as HPA 2, it was determined that survey was unnecessary based on conditions
observed during the previous nearby survey.
Field survey efforts did not result in the identification of previously recorded Site
41HN9 or any artifacts located within the project APE in the vicinity of Site 41HN9. No
evidence of the site was located within the project study corridor. Intensive, close-interval
shovel testing within the recorded boundaries of Site 41HN9 indicates that the site has been
destroyed.

NEWLY IDENTIFIED CULTURAL RESOURCES
Survey efforts completed to date indicate that one previously undocumented historic
structure (Historic Structure A), one historic site (41HN51) with an associated railroad berm,

trestle bridge and other facilities, and one previously unrecorded archaeological site
(41HN52) located within the project’s study corridor (see Figures 7 and 8). A discussion of
each newly recorded resource is provided below. State trinomials were not sought for the
historic structures. Artifacts recovered from Site 41HN51 will be returned the landowner. If
this is not possible, artifacts will be prepared for long-term housing at a state approved
curatorial repository.

Historic Structure A
Historical research indicates that Historic Structure A is a partially buried cow-dipping
vat (Figure 10). The structure is located in Hardin County on the Silsbee, Texas USGS 7.5minute topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 4). Due to a reroute of the proposed pipeline
alignment, this structure is located south of the study corridor and will not be affected by
construction. The site is located in an open pasture within an existing power transmission
ROW on an elevated grassy landform that measures approximately 26 meters (85 feet) wide by
41 meters (134.5 feet) long. Josey Lane is located immediately west of the structure and
Highway 418 is located to the north.
The structure was identified during shovel testing activities associated with the intensive
pedestrian survey of a formerly proposed pipeline alignment. It is made of poured concrete and
possesses two primary features. The first feature appears to be a walkway leading to or away
from the second feature, an octagonal-shaped basin. The walkway measures approximately 17
meters (56 feet) long and 2 meters (6.56 feet) wide. The basin measures approximately 5 meters
(16.4 feet) in diameter. The walkway feature is ninety percent buried just below the ground
surface and is covered by short pasture grass with only the concrete sides of the walkway
exposed. The basin feature is mostly exposed with short pasture grass occluding the perimeter.
A total of nine shovel tests were excavated around the structure and inside the concrete
walkway. A series of concrete steps were uncovered during the excavation of Shovel Test 7 at
55 centimeters (21 inches) below the surface (Figure 10). No buried or surface artifacts were
recorded in the vicinity of the structure. At the time of survey, the ground surface was saturated
and is likely frequently flooded based on the observation of wet mottled soils and low-lying
topography.
Soils observed as a result of shovel testing were generally composed of two strata.
Stratum I is characterized as dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) moist sandy clay loam containing
gravels from just below the ground surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (7.87 inches). Stratum
II is composed of dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) sandy clay loam mottled with yellow
(10YR7/6) wet sandy clay with gravels from 20 centimeters (7.87 inches) below the surface to a
depth of 45 centimeters (17.72 inches). Shovel tests 1 and 7 contained a third soil stratum
composed of brownish gray (10YR6/6) wet clayey sand mottled with dark grayish brown
(10YR4/2) wet sandy clay with gravels between 45 and 60 centimeters (17.72 and 23.62 inches)
below the ground surface.

Historic research indicates that cow-dipping vats were used as part of a federal and state
program enacted between 1906 and 1943 to eradicate a bovine disease carried by ticks (Hope
2005). After the civil war, Texas cattle drives brought southern herds into contact with
Midwestern and eastern cattle herds (Hope 2005). Shortly after the introduction of Texas cattle
into these regions, many ranchers began to notice a decline in the health of their own cattle
and a subsequent high mortality rate. Theobald Smith of the Department of Agriculture
determined that Texas cattle were transmitting a debilitating disease carried by cattle ticks. It
was later determined that Texas cattle had developed an immunity to the disease known as
Babesiosis (Ristic and Kreier 1981). As a result of the widespread infection of cattle without
immunity across many southern states, cow-dipping vats were widely used in compliance
with the National Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program between 1906 and 1943 (Hope 2005).
The program spanned across “the lower half of Virginia through southern Tennessee and into
the southeast sectors of Oklahoma and Texas…” (Hope 2005:8) (see Figure 10).
The walkway feature associated with a cow-dipping vat was filled with a strong
chemical solution and cattle were forced into the submerged walkway (see Figure 10). In fact,
the entire body of a cow was submerged and sticks were often used to force the head a cow
below the surface of the solution (Hope 2005). Once a cow had made its way across the
submerged walkway, a series of short steps would lead the cow out of the solution and onto a
basin shaped dripping pad, where excess solution would drain from the body of the cow (Hope
2005). These dipping vats were widely constructed across the south using the same general
construction design. The first documented cow-dipping vat in Texas was constructed in 1891
by Robert Kleburg, manager of the King Ranch (Haygood 1986).
Due to the apparent frequency of similar structures in Texas and other southern states, as
well as the significant amount of available literature (Haygood 1986; Hope 2005; Ristic and
Kreier 1981) about cow dipping vats, Historic Structure A is likely ineligible for the National
Register. Records collected include a Texas archaeological site form, a hand-drawn sketch map,
shovel test records, GPS data, and photographs.

41HN51
Site 41HN51 is a series of three associated historical features dating to the late 1800s.
The site is composed of a high density of buried historic artifacts, and a buried prehistoric
Neches River dart point (Turner and Hester 1993) (Figure 11). It was recorded on January
21, 2007 and was revisited on February 26, 2007. Site 41HN51 is located on the Kountze
South USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 3). It is situated within the
proposed temporary construction easement inside of a tree line immediately north of an
existing transmission power line south of Highway 326 and west of Highway 69/287 at
Cypress Creek in Kountze, Texas. Feature 1 associated with Site 41HN51 is a wooden
trestle bridge across Cypress Creek and abandoned railroad grade (Figure 12). Feature 2,
located on the east side of Cypress Creek, is a concrete structure with seven steps leading
into a belowground L-shaped compartment, a buried concrete pad, and concrete block with
four exposed threaded-steel bars protruding from the top surface. Feature 3 is a series of four

freestanding square concrete piers dispersed around Feature 2 (Figure 11). The site measures
approximately 60 meters (196.85 feet) southeast by northwest and 50 meters (164.04 feet)
southwest by northeast. An existing pipeline corridor marks the southeast boundary and
Cypress Creek marks the northwestern limit. A low-lying marshy area marks its southwest
boundary. The northeastern site limit is marked by a gently sloping topographic contour.
The trestle bridge associated with Feature 1 is a typical railroad support system, with
large timber beams supporting the bridge (Figure 11). The bridge is oriented northwest to
southeast and spans the entire width of Cypress Creek. The bridge appears to be in excellent
condition. The abandoned railroad grade associated with Feature 1 consists of a 6-meter
(19.69-foot) wide graded bed of large railroad gravels running northwest and southeast.
According to Mr. James A. Freeman, a nearby landowner who has lived near the location of
Site 41HN51 for more than 50 years, the railroad ties and tracks were removed in the 1990s
(Personal Communication 2007).
The belowground L-shaped compartment associated with Feature 2 measures 10
meters (32 feet) long and five meters (16 feet) wide. It is located approximately three meters
(10 feet) east of the abandoned railroad grade and 10 meters (32 feet) southeast of Cypress
Creek. Its northern wall is built into the eastern cutbank of the creek. A series of seven steps
lead down from a concrete pad into the belowground L-shaped room. A series of five steel
reinforcement bars were observed protruding from the tops of the walls of the feature. Each
of the bars is protruding from the structure suggesting that they supported another structural
feature at one time, most likely a roof or vertical extension of the walls. A built-in steel pipe
was observed on the east wall of the concrete structure measuring 10 centimeters (4 inches)
in diameter. Feature 3 is a series of four square concrete piers protruding from the ground
surface. Three of the piers are positioned in a row one meter (three feet) east of the structure,
while one is located one meter (three feet) west of the structure.
In addition to the structural features associated with Site 41HN51, buried historic and
prehistoric artifacts were recorded. A total of 31 shovel tests were excavated around the
structural features (Figure 11). Of these, 12 shovel tests contained historic artifacts and one
shovel test (ST 8) contained a prehistoric lithic dart point. The majority of the historic
artifacts appear to be associated with Features 2 and 3. Historic artifacts observed include
hundreds of brick fragments, hundreds of pieces of black hardened tar, numerous rusted nails
(some of which appear squared), several unidentifiable metal fragments, two shotgun shell
casings, a piece of thin flat window glass and few pieces of clay mortar. The historic
artifacts were observed in Levels 1-10 (just below the ground surface to 100 centimeters
[39.37 inches]), although they appear to be concentrated primarily in Levels 1-6 from the just
below the ground surface to a depth of 60 centimeters (23.62 inches) (Table 2). The site also
contains an isolated prehistoric component characterized by a buried heat treated Neches
River dart point (Turner and Hester 1993) collected from Level 1 (0-10 centimeters [0-4
inches] below the surface) of ST 8, immediately south of Cypress Creek. Charcoal fragments
were also observed although it is unclear whether they belong to the historic or prehistoric
component of the site.

Due to the high density of buried artifacts recorded during the delineation of Site
41HN51, the record of artifact densities per 10-centimeter (4-inch) level of a shovel test was
estimated according to each artifact type observed, such as brick fragments or pieces of tar.
A type of artifact totaling 10 or less was counted in the field and the exact quantity of
artifacts is displayed in Table 2, provided below. An artifact type recorded in a quantity
exceeding 10 but less then 20 per level were recorded as n<20, while artifact densities
greater than 20 but less than 50 per level were recorded as n>20. In a few instances, the
quantity of an artifact type per level exceeded 50. In such cases, the quantities were recorded
as n>50. A sample of four rusted nails was collected, including two possible square-head
nails. In addition, the prehistoric Neches River dart point was also collected (Plates 3 and 4).
Records collected include a Texas archaeological site form, a hand-drawn sketch map, shovel
test records, GPS data, and photographs. Table 2 provides a detailed record of the artifacts
recorded at the site.

Soils recorded at Site 41HN51 generally included two strata. Stratum I was composed
of a 10-centimeter (4-inch) layer of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) sandy clay loam.
Stratum II generally contained yellow (10YR7/6) sandy clay mottled with brownish yellow
(10YR6/6) sandy clay from 10 centimeters (4 inches) below the ground surface to 100
centimeters (39.34 inches). Not all shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 100 centimeters
(39.34 inches) due to saturated soils.

The structural remains and buried historic artifacts at Site 41HN51 are most likely
associated with the Sabine and East Texas Railway. In 1880, the Sabine and East Texas
Railway Company was chartered under the name of the East Texas Railway Company
(Young, 2007). In 1881, the company built 48.28 kilometers (30 miles) of track between
Beaumont and Sabine Pass and 38.62 kilometers (24 miles) between Beaumont and Kountze.
An early newspaper journalist, John W. Leonard of the Beaumont Enterprise wrote a narrative
article in 1881 entitled “At the Front”. The article document his travels north of Beaumont in
pursuit of a story about the progress of the railroad and makes mention of what we encountered
at Cypress Creek, the location of Site 41HN51. Below is an excerpt from Leonard’s article
taken from Schaadt (1991:32):
“We have traveled the road many times before and have usually
found it the dreariest road it was ever our misfortune to ride over, but we
notice a great change. All along the road we notice that the smaller timber
has been or is being cut down and converted into ties for the East Texas and
other railroads. We strike the track of the East Texas at several points. The
grading on the road is completed for about six miles above the present ed of
the track at Concord, and grading is now being done from that point to
Cypress Creek at a point three miles east of he town of Hardin and sixteen
miles from Concord. Ties are being laid down along the completed and only
the extremely wet condition of the soil prevents the early completion of the
road to Cypress”.

Within one year of completing 86.90 kilometers (54 miles) of track, an additional 78.05
kilometers (48.5 miles) of track was laid between Kountze and Rockland. In 1882, upon the
completion of 102 miles of track, the Sabine and East Texas Railway Company, was sold to the
Texas and New Orleans Railroad Company, which was owned by the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company. In 1886, approximately 30 miles of track was extensively damaged and destroyed by
floods between Sabine Pass and Beaumont, but were rebuilt in 1887. Since 1932, large sections
of the railway were abandoned and as of 1990, the section north of Beaumont was no longer in
operation (Young, 2007).
A review of the information available at the General Land Office (GLO) was
conducted to obtain any information regarding the original land deed associated with Site
41HN51, although nothing could be located. In addition, dated aerial and topographic
quadrangle maps were reviewed at the Texas Natural Resources Information System
(TNRIS) and the University of Texas in Austin. Unfortunately, the oldest topographic
quadrangle available at these facilities dates to 1984. There is no historical literature that
indicates what exactly the structural features at Site 41HN51 were in relation to the railroad,
although it is unlikely that the structural remains or buried historic artifacts represent an old
train depot or ticket office, since most of these facilities were located within the city limits.
Another excerpt from John W. Leonard’s 1881 newspaper article may shed some light on
their various possible functions of these structural remains:

38

“Hardin County wears an air of business such as we have never before saw
in it. The woods are full of men. Tie camps, grading camps, log camps, and
many branches of industry connected in one or other with railroad and
timber business, making it a perfect beehive.” (Taken from Schaadt
1991:32).
Based on the unknown function of the structural features and buried historic artifacts
associated with the historic Sabine and East Texas Railway located within the proposed
pipeline construction easement, the site warrants National Register eligibility testing or
should be avoided by pipeline construction. Enbridge plans to bore under this site to install
the pipeline (see Figure 11). The bore pits will be excavated outside of the delineated site
boundaries and fencing will be placed around the site perimeter. In the event that Enbridge
requires a travel lane across the site during construction, timber mats will be placed over the
site to avoid any adverse effects. An archaeologist will be present to monitor these activities.
41HN52
This prehistoric site, known as 41HN52 is a buried prehistoric lithic scatter with very
low artifact density that was recorded on December 13, 2006 (Figure 12). It is located on the
Kountze South, Texas USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle map (see Figures 3 and 4). Site
41HN52 is situated on the northern boundary of the proposed temporary construction easement.
It is composed of six pieces of prehistoric lithic debitage recorded below the ground surface
on a small wooded terrace situated approximately 321 meters (1053 feet) west of Village
Creek. The site is located inside of a tree line immediately north of an existing transmission
power line/pipeline corridor and a bee apiary. These features mark the site’s southern
boundary, while the northern limits are marked by a sloping contour of the terrace. A steep
gradient marks the site’s eastern boundary and a dirt road marks the sites western limits. The
site’s north-south axis is about 15 meters (49.21 feet), while its east-west axis is about 30
meters (98 feet).
The initial survey effort in the general area was conducted by excavating shovel tests
every 60 meters (196 feet) along two parallel transects spaced 30 meters (98 feet) apart north
of the existing corridor. Site 41HN52 was identified during the intensive pedestrian survey
being conducted in a location with a high probability for containing buried cultural resources
in proximity to Village Creek. Following the excavation of a positive shovel test, 18 radial
shovel tests were excavated in the four cardinal directions at 10-meter (33-foot) intervals. As
a result, a total of four shovel tests contained a very low density of prehistoric lithic debitage
(Table 3; Figure 12). Artifacts recorded consist of six flakes between levels 3-8 ranging in
depth from 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) below the surface to 80 centimeters (29.53 inches).
The vertical distribution of these flakes is likely the result of migration in loose shifting sands
during flood episodes. No diagnostic artifacts were recorded during the delineation of Site
41HN52 and no artifacts were collected during survey investigations of Site 41HN52. Soils
associated with the site are comprised of two alluvial soil strata. Stratum I is composed of
dark brown (10YR3/3) sandy loam from the ground surface to an average depth of 25
centimeters (9.84 inches). Stratum II is made up of yellowish brown (10YR5/4) sand from

25 centimeters (9.84 inches) below the surface to 100 centimeters (39.37 inches). All shovel
tests were excavated to a depth of 100 centimeters (39.37 inches) below the surface.
The site appears to represent a short-term prehistoric buried lithic scatter used for
minimal tool refurbishing. The very low density of lithic debitage, lack of diagnostic
artifacts, and wide vertical distribution of flakes indicate that the site is likely ineligible for
the National Register. Records collected include a Texas archaeological site form, a handdrawn sketch map, shovel test records, GPS data, and photographs.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the results of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey of
29.61 kilometers (18.40 miles) of the proposed 66.42-kilometer (41.27-mile) DC-36-KO
pipeline route (Table 4). The width of the study corridor varies between 120 meters (400
feet) and 60 meters (200 feet) depending on topography, disturbances, and other factors.
Total acreage surveyed along the proposed pipeline route is 328.42 hectares (811.58 acres),
which includes all HPAs and several LPAs. In addition to proposed pipeline route coverage,
a total of 95.11 hectares (235.02 acres) were surveyed along portions of former pipeline
alignment. For this project, the combined area surveyed along proposed and former pipeline
alignments consists of 423.55 hectares (1046.58 acres).

NATIONAL REGISTER ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS
Following Section 106 of the NHPA, any federal undertaking must take into account its
effect on historic resources, i.e., architectural or archaeological properties on or eligible for the
NRHP. Once resources are identified within the project’s APE, they must be evaluated for their
National Register eligibility (Advisory Council for Historic Preservation 1999). When an
archaeological site has been discovered, a major goal associated with any archaeological
evaluation is to make recommendations concerning the eligibility of the resource for the NRHP.
Archaeological resources are most frequently evaluated for eligibility in regard to Criterion D:
information potential.
For a site to be considered eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D, it must possess
information bearing on an important scientific research question. Important research questions
commonly involve testing new or former hypotheses regarding topics in the natural sciences
and/or addressing aspects of the cultural chronology of a region. This information must be
evaluated within the framework of an historic context, meaning the researcher must be able to
address how the information contained within the resource is likely to effect current
understanding of a particular time period (United States Department of the Interior [USDI]
1983:II-26, 1991:21). In order for an archeological resource to be considered significant, it
generally must retain integrity. While sites that have been disturbed through natural or cultural
processes can still be eligible if their undisturbed portions contain significant information
potential, sites that have lost their stratigraphic context are commonly considered to have lost
integrity of location (USDI: 1983:II-26, 1991:23, 49).
As a result of this survey, a total of three newly identified cultural resources have been
documented. Of these, only one resource (Site 41HN51) is considered to have unknown
National Register eligibility. Table 5 provides the location, type of resource, management
recommendations, and avoidance measures for each of the newly recorded cultural resources.

Newly recorded Site 41HN52 is a very-low density buried prehistoric lithic scatter
located immediately adjacent to an existing power/pipeline corridor. This site is located on the
northern boundary of the proposed temporary construction easement. This site contained six
chert flakes all produced as a result of tertiary stage lithic reduction. The site most likely
represents a very short term hunting camp where lithic tools were quickly refurbished. The
flakes are vertically scattered across 50 centimeters (19.69 inches) of alluvial soil deposits. The
vertical distribution of these flakes is likely the result of migration in loose shifting sands during
flood episodes. This site does not appear to have maintained enough depositional integrity to
provide important information related to any basic research questions. Based on the very-low
density of artifacts, lack of diagnostics, and questionable integrity, Site 41HN52 is likely
ineligible for the National Register and HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work.
Extant historic structures were located as a result of the survey. Newly recorded
Historic Structure A was identified as a cow dipping vat used in the first half of the twentieth
century as part of a national program enacted to eradicate disease carrying tick from cattle in
many of the southern states. The structure was not associated with any buried artifacts. Due to
a reroute of the proposed pipeline alignment, this structure is located south of the study corridor
and will not be affected by construction. Based on the apparent frequency of these structures
across the South as indicated by the significant amount of available literature documenting their
use, the structure is likely ineligible for the National Register. HRA Gray & Pape recommends
that no further work is necessary.
Newly recorded historic archaeological site 41HN51 contained three historic structural
features, in addition to buried historic artifacts and a prehistoric lithic dart point. The historic
remains are likely associated with the original Sabine and East Texas Railway built in the late
1800s at Cypress Creek in Hardin County. This site is located within the proposed temporary
construction easement. Based on the high density of buried artifacts and unknown function(s)
of the structural features at Site 41HN51, HRA Gray & Pape recommends further investigation
of this resource to determine the site’s National Register eligibility if avoidance is not possible.
Project plans indicate that Enbridge will avoid this resource by boring under the site. Enbridge
has agreed to place a fence around the perimeter of the site boundary during the excavation of
the bore pits and pipe installation. If Enbridge determines that a travel lane across the site is
necessary, timber mats will be placed over the site to avoid any adverse effects. If this is
deemed necessary, an archaeologist will be on site to monitor the placement of timber mats.

VALIDITY OF THE PREDICTIVE MODEL
A key factor in creating a strategy for sampling a project area is the development of a
predictive model whereby investigation can be concentrated most efficiently in areas with the
greatest potential for containing intact buried cultural resources. These models are based on soil
and topographic characteristics, including variations in elevation, distance to existing or remnant
water sources, and plant communities. These models serve as heuristic devices that assist
researchers in devising sampling strategies best suited for collecting data in given environmental
settings.

44

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

The predictive model developed for this project, as well as the results of previous
studies, indicated that the areas near perennial and ephemeral streams, and upland areas held the
highest potential for containing prehistoric archaeological resources. For this survey, the model
was effective and resulted in the identification of newly recorded prehistoric Site 41HN52,
which is located on an elevated terrace in close proximity to Village Creek. In the sampled low
probability areas, where existing or remnant water sources were lacking or where topography
was low-lying and subject to frequent flooding, no cultural resource loci were recorded. Field
results verified that all other surveyed property contained a low probability for identifying
intact, significant prehistoric or historic cultural deposits, as the sampled LPAs were inundated
with low-lying topography.

Re: Addendum 1 to Draft Report, Cultural Resources Intensive Pedestrian Survey of Enbridge’s
Proposed DC 36-Inch Kountze to Orange (DC-36-KO) Natural Gas Pipeline Segment in Hardin, Jasper,
and Orange Counties, Texas
United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston District (Project number pending)
Dear Ms. Beene,
This addendum to the above-referenced draft report documents an intensive pedestrian cultural resources
survey conducted on between March 21 and 23, 2007 by HRA Gray & Pape, LLC on behalf of Enbridge
Pipelines (East Texas L.P). The project was initiated at the behest of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), Galveston District (USACE Project number pending) in order to assess the potential
for impacts to cultural resources located along 66.42 kilometers (41.27 miles) of land proposed for the
construction of a 36-inch natural gas pipeline from Kountze to Orange, Texas. This project is known as the
DC-36-KO Pipeline Project in Hardin, Jasper, and Orange counties, Texas.
The original proposed pipeline route was designed to run parallel to an existing pipeline right-of-way
(ROW) across Farm to Market Road (FM 418) in Hardin County. The proposed pipeline route has
changed. The current proposed alignment at this location will depart from running parallel to the existing
ROW and turn northeast on the west side of FM 418. The pipeline will cross FM 418 where it will turn
southeast and begin to parallel the existing pipeline ROW again on the east side of FM 418 (Figure 1). The
entire rerouted section of proposed pipeline measures approximately 0.64-kilometer (0.40-mile). The Area
of Potential Effect (APE) for the newly proposed alignment is 7.42 hectares (18.33 acres).
The proposed route change at FM 418 indicates that Historic Structure A and Modern Structure A,
documented in the above-referenced draft report for survey conducted along the previously proposed route,
are no longer located within the 120-meter (400-foot) stuffy corridor and will not be affected by
construction.
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC conducted background research in order to determine whether any previously
identified cultural resources were located within or near the rerouted section of the proposed pipeline. No
previously documented properties listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), or for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation, were identified in or near the re-routed
section of the proposed pipeline. Therefore, no previously identified cultural resources are located within
the project’s APE.
The total acreage surveyed along the new proposed alignment within the 120-meter (400-foot) study
corridor was 7.42 hectares (18.33 acres). This area includes the APE and an additional 45.72 meters (150
feet) on each side of the APE for the length of the proposed route change (see Figure 1). Much of the area
was inundated, although shovel testing was conducted in all dry areas.
A total of 24 shovel tests were excavated along four transects spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart. Shovel
tests measured 30-centimeters (12 inches) in diameter. Where possible, soils were screened through a 0.64-

centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware mesh. Clay soils were divided using hand tools and visually inspected.
The shovel test interval ranged between a 60-meter (200-foot) and 100 meter (330-foot) interval depending
on whether the area was inundated or not. Shovel tests were excavated to a minimum depth of 30
centimeters (11.81 inches) in disturbed clayey soils and to a maximum depth of 100 centimeters (39.37
inches) in sandy soils. All shovel tests were negative for cultural resources.
The recorded soils were most often composed of mottled brown (10YR5/3) and yellowish red (5YR5/8) sandy
clay. The mottled nature of sand and clay indicated that portions of the area have been previously disturbed.
Soils below the sandy clay between 30 and 45 centimeters (11.81 and 17.72 inches) were saturated and shovel
tests began filling with water. A few areas contained one stratum of brown (10YR5/3) compact sand. The layer
of sand was recorded from the ground surface to the maximum reach of a shovel at 100 centimeters (39.37
inches) below the surface. The sand became very wet at the basal levels of this sandy stratum.
Two historic age structures (Historic Structure B and Historic Structure C) were recorded on the northern
boundary of the 120-meter (400-foot) wide study corridor (Figure 2) east of FM 418. Each structure is an
abandoned barn. At the time of survey, the surrounding area was being used for cattle grazing. Architectural
Historian, Lena Sweeten of Gray & Pape in Richmond, Virginia was contacted regarding the nature and
historical significance of the structures. Descriptions of the structures provided by Ms. Sweeten are provided
below.
Historic structure B is a circa 1930 simple wood frame barn. This kind of structure is a typical outbuilding
found throughout Southeast Texas. The one-and-one-half story barn measures 14.6 meters by 13.10 meters
(48 feet by 43 feet). The foundation of Historic Structure B is obscured but appears to use the post-inground technique. The structure is clad with horizontal boards on the primary facade and clad with vertical
boards on the flanking shed-roofed extensions. The primary facade has a centered bay. The barn features a
monitor roof, which is prevalent throughout the region and typically found on smaller structures like this
one. The roof is covered with corrugated metal. The barn is located in a rural landscape and is obscured by
dense vegetation. A wire fence flanks the front elevation of the barn. The structure is deteriorating and no
longer in use. Historic Structure C is located southwest of the barn.
Historic Structure C is a modest wood frame outbuilding dating to approximately 1930. It is associated with
Historic Structure B located to the northeast (Figure 2). It is located in a rural landscape and is obscured by
extensive vegetation. The long rectangular, one-story structure measures 12.20 meters by 6.10 meters (40
feet by 20 feet). The outbuilding has a post-in-ground foundation. This structure does not have any wall
cladding except for a few particleboards located on the north elevation. The roof’s framing structure is
exposed. Corrugated metal covers the roof. A fence is located along the rear elevation and wraps around to
the west elevation. This structure is in poor condition and no longer in use.
These kinds of structures are commonly occurring in the region. The materials used for the construction of
Historic Structures B and C are stock and the workmanship and design are undistinguished. The
architectural integrity of each has been significantly compromised by physical deterioration. The historical
function for each property was likely related to agriculture, but the buildings no longer appear to serve this
purpose, thereby diminishing any sense of historic feeling or association. Although the setting is still rural
and the buildings are in their original location, the dense vegetation that surrounds them building is likely
the result of their disuse.
Four shovel tests were excavated around the perimeter of each structure in an effort to determine whether
any historic artifacts were present (see Figure 2). All shovel tests were negative for cultural resources.
These structures are located just outside of the proposed 30-meter (100-foot) wide temporary construction
ROW and will not be affected by the proposed construction. Therefore, construction of the proposed
pipeline will not affect these structures. Based on the compromised nature of architectural integrity,
regional commonality and lack of uniqueness, as well as the lack of buried historic artifacts in the vicinity,
HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work at Historic Structures B and C.
As a result of the archaeological investigation conducted along the proposed reroute, no significant cultural
resources were identified within the APE or wider survey area. HRA Gray & Pape recommends no

PLAN AND PROCEDURES FOR DEALING WITH
THE UNANTICIPATED DISCOVERY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES
(INCLUDING HUMAN REMAINS) DURING CONSTRUCTION OF
THE ENBRIDGE KOUNTZE TO ORANGE (DC-36-KO) PIPELINE
PROJECT IN HARDIN, JASPER, AND ORANGE COUNTIES, TEXAS

A.

INTRODUCTION

Enbridge Pipelines L.P. (East Texas) is constructing the proposed 36-inch pipeline system that will
run from Bethel, Texas, to Orange County, Texas. The United States Corps of Engineers (USACE)
has assumed the role of lead federal agency for the project. HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, on behalf of
Enbridge Pipeline (East Texas) L.P. and URS Corporation, has been contracted to conduct a cultural
resources survey of three of the five pipeline segments: the Bethel to Crockett (DC-36-BC)
segment, the Goodrich to Kountze (DC-36-GK) segment, and the Kountze to Orange (DC-36-KO)
segment. This document describes the procedures for dealing with unanticipated discoveries of
cultural resource sites and/or human remains during the course of project construction for the DC36-KO segment. It is intended to:

B.
1.

•

Comply with applicable Federal and State laws and regulations, particularly 36 CFR 800.13
(revision of May 1999) of the regulations that implement Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended;

•

Describe to regulatory and review agencies the procedure the project or its representative
will follow to prepare for and deal with unanticipated discoveries; and,

•

Provide direction and guidance to project personnel as to the proper procedure to be
followed should an unanticipated discovery occur.
PROCEDURES FOR THE DISCOVERY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES

If any member of the construction work force believes that he or she has found a cultural
resource discovery, all work within 100 feet both sides of the discovery will stop and the Project
Construction Inspector will be notified. The area of work stoppage will be adequate to provide
for the security, protection, and integrity of the materials. A cultural resource discovery could
consist of, for example:
•

An area of charcoal or charcoal-stained soil

•

An arrowhead, stone tool, or stone chips

•

A cluster of animal bones or burned rocks in association with stone tools or chips

•

A cluster of tin cans or bottles older than 50 years

2. If the Project Construction Inspector believes that the discovery is a cultural resource, the Project
Construction Inspector will take appropriate steps to protect the discovery site. At a minimum,
the immediate area of the discovery site will be flagged. Vehicles and equipment will not be
permitted to traverse the discovery site. Work in the immediate area will not be re-started until
treatment of the discovery has been completed.
3. Enbridge or its representative will arrange for the discovery to be evaluated by an archaeologist.
The archaeologist will determine whether the discovery is potentially eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places.
4. The archaeologist will immediately contact the Texas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO)
and the USACE to seek consultation regarding the National Register-eligibility of the discovery.
If the SHPO and USACE conclude that the discovery is an eligible deposit, consultation to
determine appropriate treatment of the discovery will commence. Treatment measures may
include mapping, photography, limited probing and sample collection, or other activity.
5. The archaeologist will rapidly implement the appropriate treatment measure(s) and provide a
report on its methods and results.

C.

PROCEDURES FOR THE DISCOVERY OF HUMAN REMAINS

6. Any human remains, burial sites, or burial related materials that are discovered during
construction will be treated with dignity and respect. Although no federally recognized Native
American tribes are identified for the area, several historic tribes such as the Atakapa have
historic ties to the region and may represent descendants of any Native American remains.
7. If any member of the construction work force believes he or she has made an unanticipated
discovery of human skeletal remains, all work within 100 feet both sides of the discovery
will be stopped and the Project Construction Inspector will be notified. The area of work
stoppage will be adequate to provide for the security, protection, and integrity of the remains.
8. The Project Construction Inspector will be responsible for taking appropriate steps to protect the
discovery. At a minimum, the immediate area of discovery will be flagged. Vehicles and
equipment will not be permitted to traverse the discovery site.
9. Enbridge, or its representative, will immediately call the appropriate county coroner who will
examine the discovery and determine whether it should be treated as a crime scene or as a human
burial and notify appropriate parties.
If the remains are determined NOT to be connected with any kind of criminal activity, the
coroner or the project representative will notify the Texas State Historic Preservation Office
(SHPO) and the USACE within 24 hours. At this point, consultation will commence between
the members of the Texas SHPO, the USACE, and Enbridge to determine appropriate action.
