Abstract

ABSTRACT
On July 27, 2007, archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an intensive
linear survey of the proposed improvements to Ashford Street and Ryderwood
Avenue in Horizon City, El Paso County, Texas. The proposed improvements
consisted of expanding Ashford Street by eight feet within the existing right-ofway. Along Ryderwood Avenue the proposed project involves reconstructing and
realigning Ryderwood Avenue from 900 feet west of Ashford Street to Darrington
Road, for a total distance of 2,100 feet. The areas along Ryderwood Avenue
require an additional 60 feet of right-of-way. Based on background research,
only one previously recorded archeological site, 41EP69, was found to overlap
with the proposed project area prior to the field investigations. Investigations
consisted of pedestrian survey and visual inspection only. Due to good surface
visibility, shallow archeological deposits and observed disturbances within the
APE, shovel tests were not warranted. No evidence of Site 41EP69 was found
within the proposed project area. In addition, no cultural resources were found
within the proposed project area. As a result of the intensive survey, it is the
opinion of the Principal Investigator that there are no archeological deposits
within the proposed project area that warrant inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places. No artifacts were collected as a result of fieldwork, and all
project-related documents will be permanently curated at Hicks & Company in
Austin, Texas. This report is submitted in partial fulfillment of Texas Antiquities
Permit #4614.

Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) El Paso District proposes to
construct roadway improvements to Ashford Street and Ryderwood Avenue in
Horizon City, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed project consists of overlaying
Ashford Street with new pavement from FM 1281 (Horizon Boulevard) to
Ryderwood Avenue and expanding Ashford Street by eight feet in width within
the current right-of-way (ROW). Along Ryderwood Avenue the project will
involve not only resurfacing but also reconstructing and realigning Ryderwood
Avenue from 900 feet west of Ashford Street to Darrington Road, for a total
distance of approximately 2,100 feet. For these latter improvements the project
will require an additional 60 feet of new ROW in order to accommodate
construction of a water quality pond and curve straightening. The project will
require approximately 2.9 acres of new ROW. The project area includes new and
existing ROW that is currently in public ownership. The project will be built at
grade; hence the vertical impacts for the project are less than three feet, except
for the water quality pond, where impacts are expected to be no more than six
feet in depth. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the project includes any
proposed new ROW and existing ROW required for the project to the total depth
of impact. This project is subject to the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 106, as
amended (NHPA). In addition, the project is or will be owned and controlled by
the State of Texas and under the jurisdiction of the Texas Antiquities Code. The
archeological investigations for this project were conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit #4614. An environmental document is being compiled
separately to satisfy the requirements of NEPA.
Hicks & Company conducted background research consisting of a search of the
records of the Texas Historical Commission and the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory for archeological sites and projects within one kilometer of
the proposed project area. A total of 15 previously recorded archeological sites
were identified within one kilometer of the proposed project area. Of these 15
sites, only one archeological site, 41EP69 was recorded as overlapping with the
proposed project area.
As a result of the background research, Hicks & Company determined that there
was a moderate to high probability for archeological deposits to occur within the
proposed project area. After obtaining a Texas Antiquities Permit, Hicks &
Company conducted a linear survey of the proposed project area. This linear
survey was focused on revisiting the previously recorded Site 41EP69 and
identifying and recording any new archeological deposits within the proposed
project area. To this end, the investigators utilized a pedestrian survey of the
entire project area with no subsurface testing. Subsurface testing, in the form
of shovel testing or trenching, was not conducted since the ground surface
visibility within the project area was greater than 30 percent. In addition, the
project area was severely deflated and the potential for buried deposits was
extremely low. The pedestrian survey consisted of a walkover of the project area
with a visual inspection of the ground surface at intervals of no greater than 15
meters (appr. 50 ft). Due to the small size of the project area, the investigators
made several passes to ensure adequate coverage. Photographs were taken of
the project area to document site conditions, development, and disturbance.
This intensive survey resulted in the identification of no cultural resources
within the proposed project area, including the area adjacent to Site 41EP69. As

Environmental Summary

a result of the survey, Hicks & Company recommends that the proposed project
will have no effect upon archeological historic properties.
All investigations were conducted in accordance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and 36 CFR 800, the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation (48
FR 44716-44742), and the Secretary’s Standards for Identification (48 FR 4472044723), 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), 13 TAC 26.20(2), the First Amended
Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the THC, the FHWA, TxDOT, and the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. No archeological artifacts were
collected during the survey. Due to the absence of archeological sites or
deposits within the project area, all project materials, including photographs
and field notes, will be retained at Hicks & Company in Austin, Texas.

Environmental Summary

ENVIRONMENTAL SUMMARY
The proposed project is located in west Texas, southeast of the City of El Paso in
El Paso County. The project area lies between the Hueco Bolson and the Rio
Grande watershed, divided primarily by Badlands consisting of reddish-gray
clays and caliche capped ridgetops. The southern portion of the project area is
in the Bluepoint association of soils just above the floodplain of the Rio Grande
and consists of loamy fine sand and gravelly fine sand. The northern portion is
in the Hueco-Wink association of soils, which consists of dunal areas of loamy
fine sand and fine sandy loam. The majority of the soils in the project area are
bolson deposits derived from Oligocene through Holocene age sedimentation of
intermontane areas. The entire project area is susceptible to blowing and
aeolian deposition resulting in the formation of dunes and heavily eroded interdunal areas (Dietrich et al. 1968; Jaco 1971). There are four intermittent
drainages within the study area, however, water sources overall are sparse.
Playa lakes are present within the region; however, none are present within the
study area.
Vegetation in the project area is sparse and consists of Mesquite-Sandsage
Shrub vegetation types. Plants commonly associated with this group include
Fourwing saltbush, palmella, mormon tea, sotol, sand dropseed, mesa dropseed,
spike dropseed, blue grama, black grama, chino grama, broom snakeweed, and
devil's claw (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2007). However, the survey of
the proposed project area revealed that Creosote bushes (Larrea tridentate) and
sparse grasses were the most dominant vegetation type.
Overall, the
undeveloped portions of the proposed project area were severely deflated and
sparsely vegetated resulting in ground surface visibility ranging between 65
percent and 100 percent at the time of the survey (Figure 2).
The land use adjacent to the project area is primarily residential.
The
residential areas on the east side of Ashford Street and the south side of
Ryderwood Avenue are more established, however the west side of Ashford
Street is rapidly being developed for residential use. As a result there are
several utilities along the west side of Ashford Street including sewer, phone,
and cable. There are also two schools; a middle school and an elementary
school in the northern portion of the project area. Electric distribution lines
parallel the existing rights-of-way on both streets. Undeveloped land areas are
relatively intact with minor occurrences of land disturbance from machinery and
recreational vehicle traffic, as well as trash dumping (Figure 3).

Archeological Background and Previous Investigations

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
As stated previously the project area lies within the Hueco Bolson, a broad
drainage area west of the Hueco Mountains in El Paso County, Texas.
Culturally, this area is defined as the Western Trans-Pecos or Jornado Mogollon
region. Miller and Kenmotsu (2004) present a chronology for the region for the
Paleoindian through the Spanish Colonial periods. The Paleoindian Period in
the Western Trans-Pecos dates from 10,000 BC to 6,000 BC, the Archaic Period
from 6,000 BC to AD 200, the Formative Period/Late Prehistoric Period from AD
200 to AD 1450, and the Post-Pueblo through the Early Spanish Colonial Period
from AD 1450 to AD 1750.
The Paleoindian Period consists primarily of small, highly mobile groups relying
primarily on hunting subsistence of large mammals within a wet woodland
environment. As the environmental conditions became more xeric, sites dating
to the Archaic Period show a move towards more seasonal mobility (within a
restricted range) and specialized subsistence (diversification in utilized plant
materials) eventually transitioning to agriculture and pit house habitation in the
late Archaic. In the Formative/Late Prehistoric Period mobility decreases with
an increased dependency on agriculture resulting in more formal organization of
residential settlements including the transition from pit house architecture to
pueblo architecture and the advent of ceramics in the region. Finally, the PostPueblo and Early Spanish Colonial Periods sees the decline of the pueblo
settlements and the introduction of the Spanish explorers and missionaries in
the region (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
There is no documented historic settlement of the area around Horizon City
although it is likely the area was either utilized or traversed by early setters of El
Paso County. Horizon City is a young city, incorporated in 1988. Census data
suggests the city is primarily a middle-class bedroom community for El Paso,
and has experienced rapid growth since 1990. Initial map research suggests the
earliest parts of the community were built in the mid 1960s. A 1960 map of the
El Paso area shows Interstate 10 “under construction,” with only dirt roads not
conforming to Horizon Boulevard’s alignment in the vicinity. A 1966 map shows
IH 10 complete and Horizon Boulevard in place, providing access to the Horizon
Golf Club.
Previously Recorded Sites and Investigations
Hicks & Company conducted archeological background studies for the proposed
highway project along Ashford Street and Ryderwood Avenue in Horizon City,
Texas. The background research consisted of a search of the records of the
Texas Historical Commission and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
for archeological sites and projects within one kilometer of the proposed project
area. A total of 15 previously recorded archeological sites were identified within
one kilometer of the proposed project area. Of these 15 sites, only one
archeological site, 41EP69 was found to overlap with the proposed project area.
All 15 sites are summarized in Table 1 below.

All of the sites except for 41EP5332, 41EP5441, 41EP5535, and 41EP5536, were
recorded as part of the Hueco Mountains Project in 1974, although no
information could be found regarding this project. The records for these sites
provide only limited information with regard to site content and limits. These
sites have most likely not been evaluated for NRHP eligibility. No site records
were found for sites 41EP5332 and 41EP5441 and they do not appear to be
associated with any projects. Sites 41EP5535 and 41EP5536 were recorded as
part of the East Lake Blockup Archaeological Survey conducted by John A.
Peterson and Associates, Inc. in 2002. This survey also recorded several other
sites to the north, but these sites are outside of the one kilometer study area.
These sites have not been evaluated as to their NRHP eligibility either. As stated
previously, Site 41EP69 overlaps the northern portion of the project area and
consists of 40 or more hearth features and lithic debitage. This site requires
additional archeological investigations to determine its eligibility for inclusion in
the NRHP.
Based on a review of the site records, all of the sites for which information was
available consist of prehistoric open campsites. These vary in size, but have
similar content including hearth features of burned caliche and sandstone, lithic
debitage, ceramics, and some bone. All of the sites were identified on the
surface and are located in dunal areas subject to wind erosion and aeolian
deposition. In general, it appears site components were identified in inter-dunal
areas where erosion may have exposed or deflated the surface sediments leaving

the archeological components exposed. None of the sites have been associated
temporally or culturally, however, the presence of ceramics suggests
occupations as early as 100 A.D.

Result of Investigations

RESULT OF INVESTIGATONS
Archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an intensive survey of the
proposed project area along Ashford Street and Ryderwood Avenue. This
investigation was focused primarily on revisiting the previously recorded site
41EP69 and identifying and recording any undocumented archeological deposits
within the proposed project area. The investigations consisted of a pedestrian
survey of the proposed project area with no subsurface testing. Subsurface
testing was not conducted due to the deflated nature of the project area and the
high ground surface visibility (65 percent to 100 percent).
The investigations began along Ashford Street starting at Horizon Boulevard (FM
1821) and continuing north to Ryderwood Avenue. The APE along Ashford
Street is limited entirely to the existing ROW and the investigations noted heavy
residential development on both sides of the street. Several utilities have been
installed along the west edge of the street including a sewer line, cable lines, and
phone lines. An electricity distribution line also parallels Ashford Street along
the west edge of the ROW. In addition, portions of the west edge of the Ashford
Street have been developed into a concrete bicycle path. Disturbance from
development is very high in this area and no cultural resources were observed.
The probability for intact archeological deposits to occur along Ashford Street is
very low (Figures 4 and 5) considering that all sites in this area are on the
surface or only partially buried.

Along Ryderwood Avenue the APE includes a proposed 60 foot expansion of the
ROW to realign and reconstruct portions of the road between Darrington Road to
900 feet west of Ashford Street. Two schools are adjacent to Ryderwood Avenue
as well as residential development along the south edge of Ryderwood Avenue
between Ashford Street and Darrington Road. At the western end of Ryderwood
Avenue the area is undeveloped. It is in the western end of Ryderwood Avenue
where Site 41EP69 was previously recorded. The investigators conducted a
thorough walkover of the area where Site 41EP69 was reported to occur.
Although this area is undeveloped, there is some disturbance from machine
excavation, dumping, and recreational vehicle traffic (Figures 6 and 7).
Investigators inspected the surface and no evidence of Site 41EP69 was found
within the proposed project area.

The eastern end of Ryderwood Avenue, along the north side between Ashford
Street and Darrington Road, is also undeveloped. However, there is an elevated
berm that parallels the existing ROW of Ryderwood Avenue (Figure 8). It is
unknown whether this is man made or naturally occurring as a result of dunal
movement. This area has much less disturbance than the western end, but
some minor disturbance from machine excavation and littering is present

(Figure 9). The areas between the western and eastern ends of Ryderwood
Avenue are occupied by a large middle school, an elementary school, and a
water tank. No cultural material was identified along Ryderwood Avenue.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Hicks & Company has completed an intensive survey of the proposed project
area along Ashford Street and Ryderwood Avenue in Horizon City, El Paso
County, Texas. All investigations were conducted in accordance with the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and 36 CFR 800, the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic
Preservation (48 FR 44716-44742), and the Secretary’s Standards for
Identification (48 FR 44720-44723), 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), 13 TAC
26.20(2), the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the THC, the
FHWA, TxDOT, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
No
archeological artifacts were collected during the survey. Due to the absence of
archeological sites or deposits within the project area, all project materials,
including photographs and field notes, will be retained at Hicks & Company in
Austin, Texas. Due to the shallow nature of archeological deposits, investigators
conducted visual surface inspection only. Shovel tests were not warranted given
the good surface visibility and extensive disturbance observed throughout the
project area. The survey resulted in the identification of no archeological
deposits and found no evidence of Site 41EP69 within the proposed APE. It is
the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the proposed undertaking will have
no effect upon archeological historic properties within the APE. Due to the
absence of archeological sites or deposits within the project area, all present
materials, including photographs and field notes, will be retained at Hicks &
Company in Austin, Texas. This report is submitted in fulfillment of the
requirements under Section 106 of the NHPA and in partial fulfillment of Texas
Antiquities Permit #4614.
