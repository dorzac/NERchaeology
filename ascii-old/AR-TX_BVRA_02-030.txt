ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the 14 acre site of the proposed Support Services
Building in Brazos County, Texas was conducted in April of 1994 by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas. The area was covered using the
pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing. No prehistoric sites were
located. Historic sites consist of a standing residential structure that appears to be
modern (post-1950), the location of a house that has been moved, and a recent trash
dumping area. Not one of these locations warrants an official site number and no
further cultural resource work is recommended for the project area. The final report and
field notes will be provided to the Office of Facilities Planning and Construction, Texas
A&M University (TAMU), and the Department of Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical
Commission. Copies of these documents are also on file at BVRA for the interested
researcher. A copy of the final report will also be given to the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas. Antiquities Permit 1378 was issued to
BVRA by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) was retained by Pierce Goodwin
Alexander and Linville (PGAL) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the site of the
proposed Support Services Building in central Brazos County, Texas (Figure 1). The
project area consists of 14 acres and extends from Raymond Stotzer Parkway to a
tributary of White Creek on the north. The east and west boundaries are arbitrary lines
and are not marked by any natural features (Figure 2). Funding will be provided by the
Texas A&M University System (TAMUS). The federal regulatory agency for this project
is the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District. The project will be
reviewed at the state level by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO). Since the
project is being supported by state funds and is located on land controlled by TAMU, a
permit from the Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) was required. TAMUS was
awarded TAC permit number 1378. The project number assigned by BVRA is 94-02.
The project area is depicted on the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
topographical map, Wellborn dated 1916 and photorevised 1980 (Figure 3). The nearest
water source is White Creek to the west and one of its tributaries to the north. The
close proximity of the project area to this creek makes it a likely location for a prehistoric
or historic site. In fact, two prehistoric sites (41BZ124 and 41BZ125) are located on this
drainage just to the south of the current project area.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Background Research
The field survey was supplemented by a check of records housed at TARL in
Austin, Texas and an examination of archaeological site reports, county histories, and
other manuscripts. The records at TARL were checked for a listing of known sites in the
project area. In addition, all previous investigations in Brazos County were identified.
The Principal Investigator did all background research.
Field Survey
The area was examined in the field by means of a pedestrian survey with William
E. Moore conducting the fieldwork assisted by geologist David S. Pettus. The entire
project area was heavily vegetated requiring shovel testing as the only means of
locating sites. Shovel tests were excavated on the south bank of the tributary of White
Creek and the east bank of White Creek, the only areas considered to be high
probability for prehistoric site location. Matrix was screened through 1/4 inch hardware
cloth and data obtained from shovel testing were recorded on a shovel test log
(Appendix I). In all 22 shovel tests were dug. Basic soil descriptions were taken from
Soil Conservation Service (SCS) soil surveys published for the area obtained at the
local SCS offfice (Mowery et al. 1958). All shovel tests were backfilled and mapped
using a compass and thirty meter tape. They were plotted in relation to lines and other
points established by the surveying crew. Field notes were taken by the Project
Archaeologist and the geologist. A computer generated map of the project area was
provided by the TAMU, Department of Facilities Planning and Construction.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120).
According to him, this physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the
geological formations (Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is
hilly and situated within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an
area characterized by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are
acid sandy loams or sands.
The climate is subhumid to humid and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees and a July maximum temperature of 95 degrees
combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:180). The
altitude varies from 200-400 feet. The project area is located on a tract of land that is
bisected by White Creek. Elevations vary from 300 feet along the lower creek terraces
to 320 feet on the higher terraces away from this drainage.
According to the soil survey for Brazos County published in 1958 (Mowery et al.
1958:Sheet 31), only one soil type is found within the project area. That is Tabor fine
sandy loam (Ta), 1-3 percent slopes. This soil is part of the Tabor Series that occurs on
gently sloping uplands in most parts of the county. Soils in this series were developed
from alkaline to slightly acid sandy clay. The native vegetation consists of a scrubby
hardwood forest and an understory of shrubs and vines and a thin stand of bunchgrass.
A typical profile of Tabor fine sandy loam is: 0-7 inches, pale-brown, slightly acid
fine sandy loam; friable when moist, and slightly harder when dry; 7-10 inches, very
pale brown, acid fine sandy loam and very friable when moist; 10-26 inches, light,
yellowish-brown, strongly acid clay mottled with yellow and with a few yellowish-red
spots. It is very slowly permeable; very firm when moist, very sticky and plastic when
wet, and extremely hard when dry. It is fair for crops and pasture as natural fertility is
low. A combination of suitable field crops and livestock farming is the most practical
use for this soil.
Although the soils in Brazos County are being reevaluated, the field survey at the
Support Services Building site appeared to confirm the soils in the project area are at
least similar to the Tabor fine sandy loam as described above.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A check of the records at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no archeological sites
have been recorded in the project area. According to the files at TARL, numbers have
been assigned or reserved for 126 sites in Brazos County (No site forms have been
filed for sites 41BZ106 - 41BZ108). Fifty-four sites were recorded as a result of the
Millican Reservoir Project to the southeast of the present study area.
Data for the discussion which follows were taken from the TARL site files, the
THC library, various bibliographies (Moore 1988, 1989b; Patterson 1986; Simons 1981),
a data base by Leland W. Patterson (1989), and published volumes of an ongoing
project abstracting Texas contract reports (Moore 1990, 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1993a,
1994). The previous works discussed below consist of major projects in Brazos County
and vicinity and those smaller area surveys that resulted in recording new sites or
assessed sites previously recorded. The remaining studies that did not record sites can
be found in those works cited above.
Sites are often recorded as a result of collectors sharing their information with
archaeologists or state agencies. The first seven sites recorded in Brazos County
(41BZ1-41BZ7) document private collections and were recorded in the 1960s and
1970s. Sites 41BZ31-41BZ35; 41BZ38; 41BZ73-41BZ74; 41BZ76; 41BZ83-41BZ84;
41BZ90-41BZ91; 41BZ93-41BZ102 were recorded by individuals (TARL site files).
Much of the data regarding sites in Brazos County are from surface collections.
At prehistoric sites, this often occurs as surface scatters containing debitage with few, if
any, diagnostic artifacts. Therefore, very little is known concerning the cultural affiliation
of many sites in the county.
Although, in general, this area has not been the locus of major projects by
professional archaeologists, several studies in the vicinity have provided valuable
comparative data. Excellent summaries of the prehistory of this part of Texas have
been compiled by Kotter (1981) Roemer and Carlson (1987), Prewitt (1981), and Thoms
(1993).
Prehistoric Investigations in Brazos County
The first systematic investigation in Brazos County occurred when portions of the
Navasota River Basin were surveyed within the authorized dam site for the Millican
Reservoir in 1971 by R. T. Ray and Alton Briggs for the THC and Texas Water
Development Board. According to Kotter (1981:391-392), this initial survey recorded
nine archeological sites (41BZ8-41BZ16). One site (41BZ15) contained an historic
component as well as prehistoric materials. The results of this project remain
unpublished.

7

A second archeological survey of the Navasota River Basin was conducted by
the Texas Archeological Survey (Sorrow and Cox 1973) for the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District. This work was carried out in anticipation of the
proposed Millican Lake on the Navasota River that would inundate portions of Brazos,
Grimes, and Madison counties. Flooding caused by frequent rains during the project
made it impossible for much of the bottomlands to be examined. The amount of land
surveyed is not mentioned in the report and shovel testing was not conducted. In
Brazos County, 14 prehistoric sites (41BZ17- 41BZ30) were recorded. Nine sites
(41BZ8-41BZ16), previously recorded by the THC in 1971, were revisited.
The majority of the prehistoric sites found by Sorrow and Cox were thinly
distributed lithic scatters exposed in rodent spoil piles. Approximately half of all sites
examined contained only lithic debitage, and only three sites contained evidence of
subsistence in the form of mussel shell or grinding stones. According to Kotter
(1981:34-35), this survey was useful in that it demonstrated that large numbers of sites
exist in an area previously thought to contain few cultural resources.
It was concluded that the number of sites recorded represents only a fraction of
the total present in the basin. The age of sites in the basin is believed to range from
Paleoindian to historic. It was recommended that a more comprehensive study of the
area, including subsurface testing, be carried out prior to construction of the dam.
A review of prehistoric and historic resources in the Millican Project was
conducted by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Kotter and Victor 1981) prior to an
assessment of the cultural resources of the Millican Project (Navasota River Basin) by
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Kotter 1981), and they recorded 32 sites (41BZ39-41BZ70;
41BZ75 [out of the project area]) and two localities. Site 41BZ46 is historic and 41BZ66
contains prehistoric and historic components.
The Millican project represents the most intensive study of cultural resources in
Brazos County. Data collected indicate that significant cultural resources are present
within all portions of the project area. Although some of the sites may be eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places, not one was nominated. The possibility of the area
as a district was discussed.
The Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (TSDHPT)
conducted a survey of the State Highway crossing of the Navasota River in 1977. Two
prehistoric sites, 41BZ36-41BZ37, were recorded. Both were recommended for further
testing. This information was taken from the TARL site files.
An archeological survey was conducted by the Cultural Resources Laboratory,
TAMU in 1980 of a proposed pipeline corridor (Baxter 1980). A pedestrian survey,
augmented by shovel testing, evaluated prehistoric site 41BZ22 previously recorded by
Sorrow and Cox (1973). It was concluded the site is not significant and no further work
was recommended.

8

An archeological survey was conducted by the Cultural Resources Laboratory,
TAMU in 1981 of seven tracts of land in Brazos, Grimes, Madison, Montgomery, and
Walker counties (Carlson 1981). The size of the project area is not mentioned in the
report. One prehistoric site (41BZ37), previously recorded by TSDHPT in 1977, was
examined. That part of 41BZ37 in the project area was disturbed and not considered
significant. No new sites were recorded.
The Archeological Research Laboratory, TAMU conducted an archeological
survey of the proposed Millican Landfill project in 1984 (Drollinger 1984). Eighty-eight
acres were examined by a pedestrian survey augmented by shovel testing. This survey
resulted in the recording of five prehistoric sites (41BZ78- 41BZ82) and six isolated
finds. Additional testing to determine site significance was recommended for sites
41BZ78, 41BZ79, and 41BZ81.
An archeological survey of the proposed Bryan Industrial Park was conducted by
the Archeological Research Laboratory, TAMU in August of 1984 (DeMarcay 1985). A
pedestrian survey and shovel testing of 112 acres resulted in the recording of three
historic sites, 41BZ71, 41BZ72, and 41BZ77. These sites were disturbed and no further
action was recommended.
In 1986, an archeological survey of the proposed Bryan Athletic Complex was
conducted by the Archeological Research Laboratory, TAMU (Drollinger 1986).
Pedestrian survey and shovel testing of a 60 acre tract resulted in the recording of one
historic site (41BZ86) producing artifacts dating to the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Testing of this site for significance was recommended if avoidance is not
possible.
Two prehistoric sites (41BZ87-41BZ88) and one historic site (41BZ89) were
recorded by TSDHPT in 1987. This work was done as an evaluation of proposed State
Highway 47. This information was taken from the TARL site files.
An archaeological survey for the Coulter Field Environmental Assessment
Project was performed in 1989 by Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore 1989a).
One historic site, the location of a early twentieth century house (41BZ92), was found in
the 247.75 acre tract.
In 1990, TSDHPT conducted an assessment of the park and ride lots (9.5 acres)
along FM 2818 (Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation 1990).
One previously recorded site (41BZ73) was evaluated.
The environmental firm, Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc., surveyed a 5.9
kilometer transmission line in 1990 (Baxter 1990) and recorded two lithic scatters
(41BZ103 and 41BZ104).

9

A cultural resources survey by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc., was conducted
in 1991 (Gearhart 1991). Examination of three 2.3 hectare well pads recorded one
prehistoric lithic scatter as 41BZ105.
The first major project in the county since the Millican Reservoir study was
conducted by the Archeological Research Laboratory, TAMU, in 1991. A survey of
selected areas of a 530 acre tract resulted in the recording of eight sites
(41BZ109 - 41BZ111; 41BZ119 - 41BZ123). Of this total, 2 sites are prehistoric, 4 are
historic, and 2 contain both prehistoric and historic components. In addition to the
survey, previously recorded site 41BZ1 was evaluated. A report is in preparation
(Alston Thoms, personal communication, May 1993).
In May of 1992, the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) conducted a
survey of a portion of the proposed wastewater treatment plant on White Creek
approximately 3 miles southwest of the current project area and associated facilities
(Whitsett and Jurgens 1992). Six sites (41BZ112 - 41BZ117) were recorded. Testing
was recommended for two prehistoric sites (41BZ112 and 41BZ115) and archival
research for the historic component of 41BZ115. An additional survey was requested to
cover 102 acres not covered during their in-house investigation.
Following up the recommendations by TWDB, The Archeological Research
Laboratory, TAMU, surveyed the remaining 102 acres and recorded 41BZ118, a
probable farmstead complex occupied during the late 1800s and early 1900s (Thoms
1993). This site was considered to possess significant research potential and testing
was suggested if avoidance is not possible. Testing was also conducted at 41BZ112
and testing and archival work at 41BZ115. Site 41BZ115 was recommended for further
work if avoidance is not possible and that portion of 41BZ112 in the project area was
not considered significant.
In the spring of 1993, Archaeology Consultants, Inc. examined 203 acres
proposed for the site of the Bush Presidential Library Center project (Moore and Warren
1993). This work was performed under the supervision of James E. Warren (Principal
Investigator) with the field survey directed by William E. Moore of Brazos Valley
Research Associates. Two prehistoric sites (41BZ124 and 41BZ125) were recorded.
Neither site was recommended for additional work.
Brazos Valley Research Associates surveyed a 12 acre park site in Brazos
County in the summer of 1993 and recorded a very disturbed historic site which was
recorded as 41BZ126 (Moore 1993b). This site was not considered to possess
research potential and no additional work was recommended.

Historic Investigations in Brazos County
The only historic site to be examined by professional archaeologists is the
Richard Carter homestead (41BZ74) about five miles south of Coulter Field on Carter
Creek. At circa 1831, this is one of the earliest historic sites in Brazos County. It was
first excavated under the direction of Shawn Bonath Carlson (1983) of the Archeological
Research Laboratory, TAMU, in 1983.
Additional archeological investigations were conducted at this site in December
of 1985 as a prerequisite to development of a city park. Ninety-eight test units produced
artifacts typical of a mid-nineteenth century dwelling and further confirmed the presence
of the Carter homestead at that location. Based on this work, 41BZ74 was considered
eligible for State Archeological Landmark status. The fieldwork was directed by Shawn
Bonath Carlson (1987).
In July of 1985, Mt. Zion Baptist Church was recorded by Erwin Roemer and
William E. Moore as 41BZ85. This structure is believed to be the last remaining building
from the original Stone City community. This site was recorded during the 41BU16
project (Roemer and Carlson 1987).
Various aspects of Brazos County history have been documented in the form of
books, theses, and articles.
A history of the county written for the Texas
Sesquicentennial celebration by the Brazos County Heritage and History Council and
the Family History Foundation is the most comprehensive study that has been done at
this time. This book was written by several authors and edited by Glenna Fourman
Brundidge (1986). Other relevant studies include a compilation of place names of
Brazos County from 1821-1880 by John Williams Diem (1981), a manuscript describing
life in Bryan during the period 1821-1921 by Mary Edna Dorsey (1976), a history of
Brazos County written by Elmer Grady Marshall (1937) for his masters thesis, an early
history of Bryan and the surrounding area by Joseph Milton Nance (1962), and a
historical tour of Brazos County compiled by students of Bryan High School (Ragsdale
1976).

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGY
The project area is located within the boundaries of a large region consisting of
eleven counties and described by Kotter (1981:30-34) in his discussion of the Millican
Reservoir project. According to Kotter (1981:30), this region forms a geographic and
environmental unit that exhibits traits that differ from nearby areas and cannot be
classified as belonging to any of the presently defined adjacent cultural expressions. In
his scheme, the Brazos River forms the approximate western boundary and southern
Brazos and Grimes counties represent the southern boundary. Kotter's prehistoric
chronology is divided into three major periods or lifeways: Paleoindian, Archaic, and
Formative. This chronology is tentative and often relies on comparative data from
adjacent regions.
Paleoindian Period
The common conception of the Paleoindian period is the time following the last
ice age (Pleistocene) in North America when man wandered about the continent in
pursuit of megafauna such as mammoth, mastodon, and earlier species of bison.
Although not much is known about their diet, plants and other smaller animals probably
were as important to the Paleoindian as an occasional mammoth or other large animal.
Recent subsistence data in the region relate to this period. At site 41BZ76 on the
Brazos River, evidence has been found that a mammoth may have been butchered by
Paleoindians about 10,000 years ago (Carlson, et al. 1984; Steele and Carlson 1989)
and sites on the Robertson County side of the Brazos River have produced freshwater
mussel shells associated with chert flakes that date to between 6000 and 8000 years
ago (Haywood and Waters 1990).
Paleo-Indians are also noted for the manufacture of unique and distinctive
projectile points. In Brazos County a variety of Paleo-Indian point types has been
found. Most of these specimens have been surface collected. Known types found in
Brazos County include Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Meserve, Plainview, San Patrice,
and Scottsbluff. Descriptions of these and other types mentioned in this section are
found in Turner and Hester (1985) and Suhm and Jelks (1962). Although dates for this
period are tentative, Paleoindians probably occupied the general area between 7000
and 8000 years ago (Prewitt 1981; Bond 1977; Shafer et al. 1975) and perhaps longer.
Sites with in situ deposits dating to the Paleo-Indian period are few in number,
and none have been found in Brazos County. Sites that have produced surface
collected specimens include the Thurmond site, 41BZ2, 41BZ73, and 41BZ70. Located
just across the Brazos River in Burleson County is Winnies Mound (41BU17).
Excavation at this site by Bradley F. Bowman (1985) in 1983 resulted in the recovery of
two Paleo-Indian artifacts, a Plainview-like dart point and a San Patrice dart point.

12

In adjacent Grimes County an ongoing testing program by Espey, Huston &
Associates, Inc. has recovered evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation in the form of dart
point types Angostura, Dalton, and Lerma (Rogers 1993:123).
Archaic Period
The Archaic period is generally defined as the time following the extinction of
Pleistocene megafauna during which small bands of hunters and gatherers roamed the
countryside in search of food in the form of plants and animals. The addition of
horticulture, pottery, and the bow and arrow are viewed as major technological changes
that led to the end of this period. During this time the overall population gradually
increased as evidenced by a greater number of sites. Kotter's (1981:31-34) discussion
of the Archaic for the Navasota River basin is divided into four phases, Early, Middle,
Late, and NeoArchaic.
The early Archaic is viewed by Kotter as a period of transition from the big-game
hunting tradtions of Paleoindians to a broader based economy. He believes that during
the early stages of this period groups of people were utilizing Paleoindian technology
while practicing an Archaic economy. The Angostura type projectile point is considered
diagnostic of this early phase, although others classify it as Paleo-Indian. Although
most evidence of this phase occurs as single finds, apparent occupation sites are
reported within the Lake Limestone area (Prewitt and Mallouf 1977; Mallouf 1979). Site
41BU17, located just across the Brazos River in Burleson County, has also produced
projectile points that have been dated as Early Archaic (Bowman 1985).
During the later phase of this period a diversification of stemmed projectile point
types and tool types appeared. This assumption is based on artifact types considered
characteristic of the early Archaic period in other areas of Texas. Diagnostic points of
this phase include Gower, Hoxie, Axtell, Carrollton, Dawson, Trinity, and Wells types as
well as Waco sinkers and Clear Fork gouges.
Throughout the early Archaic period there appears to have been close affinities
with cultural areas to the west (Central Texas) and north (North-central Texas). Later
phase sites of the early Archaic period are more numerous in the northern portion of the
region and along mainstream river channels. The numbers decrease along lateral
tributary streams. Site records at TARL list one site (41BZ26) in Brazos County as early
Archaic.
The Middle Archaic period appears to be simply a continuation of those adaptive
strategies employed during the late Archaic discussed above. Kotter (1981:32) believes
that no significant changes in the basic exploitive strategies occurred from those noted
in the early Archaic. The region defined by Kotter (1981) is situated on the western
edge of the geographical extent of the La Harpe Aspect as defined by Johnson (1962).
Tool types are comparable to those found in East Texas and, according to Kotter
(1981:32), "may lend some credence to the validity of the La Harpe Aspect as a
generalized adaptive system during the middle Archaic."

13

Point types considered by some to be diagnostic of this period include
Yarbrough, Neches River, Pedernales, Morrill, and Dawson. Site records at TARL do
not list any sites in Brazos County as Middle Archaic. Projectile points diagnostic of this
period have been found at site 41BU16 on the Brazos River in Burleson County
(Roemer and Carlson 1987).
The late Archaic is marked by changes in subsistence orientation and an
increase in the intensity of influence from other cultural areas. For the first time there
was a marked exploitation of major river tributaries and other areas away from the
mainstream river channels. Prewitt and Grombacher (1974) believe the use of tributary
streams may be indicative of sporadic or seasonal exploitation and not semi-permanent
camps. The projectile point assemblage is characterized by a contracting stem tradition,
primarily the Gary type. Other diagnostic tools include Godley, Woden, Ensor, Kent,
Refugio, and Edgewood projectile points; Bristol and Erath bifaces; Bronson knives; and
Perkin pikes. Sandy paste ceramics associated with Gary points are thought to occur
throughout the area as well. Site records at TARL list four sites (41BZ78, 41BZ79,
41BZ81, and 41BZ82) in Brazos County as probable Late Archaic.
The Neo-Archaic period is marked by the addition of arrow points and the use of
ceramics. Kotter (1981:33) believes few, if any, changes in subsistence strategies
occurred during this time. This argument is strengthened by the association of Gary
points and ceramics. No direct evidence of horticulture is known from this region. He
also states that the Neoarchaic period probably continued to the time of historic contact.
Cultural materials diagnostic of this period are common in the region. Neoarchaic sites
are found along both mainstream river and tributary environments indicating the same
localities exploited during the late Archaic were utilized. During the Neoarchaic, there is
a demonstrable relationship between this region and adjacent cultural areas. Trade and
cultural borrowing with groups in East, North-central, Southeast, and Coastal Texas are
believed to have been present.
Formative Period
This stage is viewed by Kotter (1981:34) as a time when changes in social and
economic organization, accompanying a dependence on agriculture, occurred. This
can be identified by the presence of mound and village sites. However, if agriculture
was practiced in the region it was probably not intensive or widespread. Sorrow and
Cox (1973) believe evidence of this stage in the region may exist due to the large
number of sites within their project area containing ceramics. Site records at TARL do
not list any sites in Brazos County as Formative.

14

HISTORIC CHRONOLOGY
Very little evidence of historic Indian groups has been found in the region.
Mallouf (1979) reported the presence of Poyner Engraved ceramics at some sites. This
type has been found at historic Indian sites in East Texas and may date from A.D. 1200
to A.D. 1700 (Suhm and Jelks 1962:123-125). The possibility of metal arrow points in
this region has been noted by Duffield (1960). The two historic Indian groups most
likely to have lived in Brazos County are the Bidais and Tonkawa. Kotter (1981:34)
believes archaeological sites with evidence of historic contact may exist in all portions of
this area. The scarcity of such sites, he believes, is due to the short time span of
occupation and the limited sample of cultural materials available from surface
examinations. Site records at TARL do not list any sites in Brazos County as Historic
Indian.
The earliest European activity in the area was by French and Spanish explorers
who were interested in claiming Texas for their countries. During the 17th and 18th
centuries, many explorers passed through the area in an attempt to establish missions
and gain footholds in Texas. Of the many roads and trails created during this time, the
Old San Antonio Road (OSR) which connected Saltillo, Mexico with Natchitoches,
Louisiana forms the western boundary of Brazos County about 10 miles from the project
area. The earliest settlement in this part of Texas was Pilar de Bucareli, established
near Natchitoches by the Spanish in 1774 for exiles from Los Adais Mission. Its
location was at the intersection of the La Bahia Road and Old San Antonio Road on the
east bank of the Trinity River about 60 miles northeast of the project area. The purpose
of this settlement was to support Spanish interests in the area (Bolton 1970:406-407). It
remained populated until 1779 when Indian raids, fire, and floods forced an
abandonment of the frontier (Victor 1981:236).
By the early 1800s, Texas was under the control of Mexico following a revolt
against Spain in 1810. Actual settlement of the area began in 1820 with the arrival of
Stephen F. Austin's Old Three Hundred settlers. Mexico viewed American settlement
as a means of developing its northern state and raising capital through land sales (Miller
1986:8). The project area is located in the tract of land patented by Joseph E. Scott
between 1838 and 1841. Andrew Robinson, who established a ferry across the Brazos
River in 1821 about 40 miles southeast of the project area, was probably the first settler
to enter the Brazos Valley (Webb 1952:II, 490). Andrew Millican moved to the area in
1821 and is recognized as the first Anglo-American settler to establish a home in
Brazos County. During this period the area was sparsely settled with most inhabitants
depending on agriculture for their livelihood. According to McKay (1986:2), only two
families were living in the county seat of Boonville as late as 1852. These pioneer
communities, according to Walker (1986:21), "retained their rural, agricultural nature
well into the twentieth century."

15

Victor (1981:239) credits the arrival of the railroad in 1860 as the beginning of the
second phase of settlement in Brazos County. McKay (1986:1) writes that before the
railroad, Brazos County was populated primarily by Southern agrarians living on
scattered farms and plantations along the river bottoms. The railroad changed the way
people lived. In 1870, for example, self-contained farmers were dominant and less than
half of Texas had been settled. By 1900, the entire state had been transformed into an
empire with commercial agriculture the main industry (Spratt 1983). In less than 30
years, Bryan became a permanent trade and population center with cotton the main
crop (McKay 1986:4). The population of Brazos County in 1870 represented an
increase of 232% since 1860 (McKay 1986:3). According to Diem (1981), Brazos
County settlers were not town builders. He states that Boonville was the only real town
in existence before 1860. Most of the development in the county resulted from the
railroad. Bryan, Millican, Benchley, and Wellborn were towns created because of the
Houston and Texas Central Railway.
The period from 1900 to 1938 is marked by increased growth, primarily due to
the continuation of the railroad as a major influence on the local economy and the
emergence of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas as a major college. A
major factor to growth in the immediate area, the railroad, was increased in 1901 when
the college granted a right-of-way near the project area to the Houston and Texas
Central Railway in 1901. Small farms, often managed by tenant farmers and
sharecroppers, continued to exist and subsistence farming with an occasional cash
crop, usually cotton, was common.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been
recorded in the project area. There was also no indication that any portion of the
proposed 14 acre Support Services Building site had been surveyed by professional
archaeologists. Several significant archaeological projects have been carried out in
Brazos County and vicinity with the closest being conducted by Archaeology
Consultants, Inc. on White Creek, approximately 700 meters to the southeast.
No prehistoric sites were found in the project area. The soils were shallow with
the deepest shovel test encountering clay at only 55 cm. The majority of tests
contained only 20-30 cm of topsoil above clay. It is assumed that this tributary of White
Creek was not a desirable location for prehistoric settlement. Perhaps it is an
intermittent stream which was not viewed as a dependable water supply in prehistoric
times.
Two historic sites were noted. At the time of the survey a standing structure was
present in the form of a residence (Figure 2). This area was off limits to the survey crew
and was not examined. It is believed to be modern in age (post-1950) and not eligible
for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological
Landmark. To the east is a clearing where another house once stood (Figure 2). This
was also a modern structure and not considered significant. Neither structure was
present in 1958 when the aerial photography was taken for the Brazos County soils
book.
In addition to the two house sites, a rather large trash dump, estimated at 3 x 10
meters in size, was observed (Figure 2). This dump contained tin cans, sewer pipe
fragments, miscellaneous metal objects, glass bottles, plastic bottles, and other
unidentifiable items. The vast majority of the trash is recent in age, although no attempt
was made to search for older items beneath the surface layer. No site number was
assigned to this area and no additional work is recommended.

17

RECOMMENDATIONS
Three areas of historic interest were observed in the project area. Not one,
however, was considered significant and no official TARL site numbers were assigned.
It is recommended that TAMU be allowed to proceed with construction as planned. It is
always possible that cultural materials are missed during any cultural resources survey.
Should additional areas containing prehistoric or historic artifacts not discussed in this
report be discovered during construction, the Texas Antiquities Committee must be
notified immediately and work stopped until the situation can be evaluated by the THC.
