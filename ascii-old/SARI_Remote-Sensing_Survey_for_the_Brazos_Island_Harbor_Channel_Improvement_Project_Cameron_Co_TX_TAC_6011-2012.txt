EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Southeastern Archaeological Research, Inc., conducted a Phase I marine remote-sensing survey
in Cameron County, Texas, in preparation for the US Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston
District, proposed undertaking, “Brazos Island Harbor Channel Improvement Project.” The
project entails deepening and widening the existing ship channel within Brazos Santiago Pass,
areas offshore of the pass, and a section of the Brownsville Ship Channel. Magnetic and
bathymetric data and side-scan sonar imagery were collected along the proposed affected
areas of the undertaking to assess the presence or absence of potential submerged cultural
resources. The area surveyed equated to approximately 293 acres. Local informants were
interviewed; previous archaeological investigations and reported sites were identified; a
historic map review was conducted; and environmental, prehistoric, and historic contexts were
developed for the project area. Five potential submerged historic resources were identified
within or adjacent to the project area, four of which are recommended not eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). One site, Anomaly M10, may be associated
with the Brazos Santiago Depot NRHP property (41CF4). This site will not be directly impacted
by the proposed undertaking, nor are future indirect impacts relating to the undertaking likely
to occur.

INTRODUCTION
The US Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District (USACE) contracted Southeastern
Archaeological Research, Inc. (SEARCH) to conduct a Phase I maritime archaeological
investigation for a proposed undertaking entitled “Brazos Island Harbor Channel [BIHC]
Improvement Project.” The BIHC Improvement Project proposes to deepen and widen an
existing stretch of the Brownsville Ship Channel (BSC), the Brazos Santiago Pass channel, and a
portion of the offshore approach (Figure 1). The USACE anticipates requiring 15.2 meters (m)
(50 feet [ft]) on either side of the existing toe of the channel to successfully complete the
project, with an additional 15.2 m (50 ft) required for unanticipated construction impacts.
The archaeological project was designed to assist the USACE in meeting its obligation under
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended (PL 89-665), by identifying
the presence or absence of potential submerged cultural resources and providing
recommendations regarding the eligibility status of any resource for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Work was conducted to also comply with the Archaeological
and Historic Preservation Act, as amended (PL 93-291); the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987;
and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation revised 36 CFR Part 800 regulations. The
project was conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit (6011; Appendix A), and the research
design and reporting followed guidelines set forth in the Texas Administrative Code (Title 13
Part 2 Chapter 28).
Jeff Enright, MA, RPA, served as Principal Investigator on the project and supervised the data
collection, analysis, and report preparation. The marine survey portion of the project was
conducted on August 26–28, 2011. Data and records collected are archived at the North Gulf
Coast Office of SEARCH in Pensacola, Florida; no artifacts were collected. No difficulties were
encountered during the course of the project that adversely affected its results. The remainder
of this report is organized into five sections that present the environmental and cultural
contexts for the project area, the project research design, and the archaeological results and
recommendations. References cited and appendices follow the main body of the report.
The project research design applied environmental factors and the cultural context to develop a
predictive model for submerged cultural resources. The region’s historic maritime activity
peaked during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which became a focal time period for
the research design. The Brazos Santiago Depot NRHP property (41CF4) played a vital role in
the economic and military character of the region. Remains from this depot lie intact,
submerged, and adjacent to the project area. The authors closely examined the history of the
depot and prior investigations of its extant features. SEARCH utilized Texas Administrative
Code guidelines as a base for designing a survey methodology to best capture potential
submerged cultural resources in the remote-sensing record. Data processing and analysis
followed techniques and theories to best recognize and identify potential resources, and then
applied the predictive model to the processed data to make recommendations.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
This discussion concerning the environmental conditions of the BIHC focuses primarily on
geology and weather, the factors that historically contribute to vessel loss and site
preservation. In addition, particular attention is given to past sea level rise and environmental
change as it relates to potentially submerged prehistoric sites. Similar studies have been
presented in previous cultural resource management reports.

GEOLOGY
The project area is located at the southernmost tip of Texas within the lower Rio Grande Valley
of the Texas Coastal Zone. This region is characterized by low coastal plains, bays, estuaries,
and a series of barrier islands and peninsulas that separate the Texas mainland from the Gulf of
Mexico. These coastal features result from a series of active geologic processes including
longshore drift, beach wash, wind deflation and deposition, tidal currents, wind-generated
waves and currents, and river point-bar and flood deposition (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992).
Geologically speaking, the modern coastline of south Texas is a recent development. During
the Pleistocene period the sea level was approximately 150 m (492 ft) below what it is today.
The exposed shoreline would have extended several miles past the current shoreline. During
this period of lower sea level, the Rio Grande carved deep valleys into the lower, older strata.
As the continental glaciers melted and receded, sea levels rose and flooded the alluvial valleys.
Subsequently, the submerged valleys were filled by silts and clays deposited by the sedimentladen Rio Grande. Between 10,000 and 7000 BP, the Pleistocene valleys were completely filled
and the continued deposition prograded a delta over the earlier deposits, ultimately creating
the Holocene deltaic plain. Approximately 3000 BP, the Rio Grande sedimentation slowed and
sea levels stabilized. It was during this period that Padre Island and Laguna Madre formed,
creating the modern environment that is observed today (Pearson 1987).
The project area extends from the Laguna Madre through Brazos Santiago Pass seaward into
the Gulf of Mexico. Brazos Santiago Pass, a historically significant shipping channel, is a natural
coastal inlet positioned between South Padre and Brazos Islands connecting the Gulf of Mexico
and Laguna Madre.

CLIMATE AND WEATHER
The south Texas Coast is classified as semi-arid and sub-tropical with an average rainfall of
approximately 64 centimeters (cm) (25 inches [in]) per year. The majority of the rainfall is
confined to the summer and early fall, coinciding with tropical storm patterns that often affect

the area. Historically, these storms are a major contributing factor for shipwrecks in the area
(Lydecker and James 2006).
Tropical storms are common in the Gulf of Mexico during the late summer and fall. Storms
form as air temperatures cool over warmer water, resulting in heat and moisture being quickly
released from the sea into the cooler ambient air. The moist air rises more quickly than it can
be replaced, creating a pocket of low pressure. Cooler air from adjacent high-pressure areas is
pulled into the low-pressure pocket and is warmed. This new air rises as it warms, continuing
the process. As the air rises it cools, and the moisture carried by the air turns into clouds. The
continued convection powers the storm, generating more winds and moisture until it crosses
over dry land, where it loses its main driving strength.
In addition to tropical storms, the project area also is subject to intense storms called northers.
The prevailing wind in southern Texas blows from the south with an average velocity of 20
kilometers per hour (kph) (12 miles per hour [mph]); however, a secondary northern wind can
develop, especially during the winter storm months. These northers are typically much
stronger but short-lived, lasting only a few days. These winds are polar air masses that pass
down over Canada and the United States with wind velocities reaching 25 to 80 kph (16 to 50
mph) (Hayes 1965). Northers also generate wind tides, which inundate the bays and create
high-velocity, sediment-laden currents through tidal passes such as the Brazos Santiago.

CULTURAL SETTING
PREHISTORIC OVERVIEW
The prehistory of Texas is divided into three periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric.
The Archaic period is further subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods based on such
factors as subsistence, technology, and social complexity. The Late Prehistoric period is
subdivided into cultural regions based on archaeological evidence such as similarity of
subsistence, settlement patterns, and pottery types. The BIHC project area is located within the
Gulf Coast cultural region of Texas. Specifically, the project area is located within the Rio
Grande Delta. Paleo-environmental data indicate that during the Pleistocene, sea levels were
substantially lower than they are today and did not stabilize at their current level until
approximately 3000 BP. Therefore, the potential remains for submerged prehistoric deposits
on the drowned paleo-shore. There is currently very little evidence for Paleoindian or Archaicperiod occupations in the Rio Grande Delta. These early-period sites have probably been
flooded by rising sea levels, buried deeply in sediment by flood deposits, or destroyed by
hurricane and storm activity. The prehistoric periods are discussed below to provide a cultural
context for potential submerged prehistoric archaeological sites in the BIHC project area.

Paleo-Environmental Context
Approximately 20,000 BP, southern Texas was a much more temperate area than it is today,
with cooler temperatures and a drier climate. However, beginning approximately 20,000 BP,
global climatic shifts marked the end of the Ice Age. The warmer weather began melting the
continental ice sheets, resulting in a rapid rise of sea levels worldwide. As sea levels rose in
southern Texas, major river valleys such as the Guadalupe, Trinity, and Nueces became
inundated and created what would become the modern coastal bays. The Rio Grande
experienced similar inundation; however, due to the heavy sediment loads that are transported
by this river, any early bays have since been filled with sediment (Ricklis 2009).

Paleoindian Period (ca. 10,000–6000 BC)
The earliest evidence of human occupation in the project area dates to the Paleoindian period
(ca. 10,000–6000 BC). The primary evidence of these people is stone tools, especially projectile
points. As is the case throughout most of Texas, these Paleoindian artifacts are considered
isolated finds rather than Paleoindian sites, as there are often no associated Paleoindian
cultural deposits. Because sea level was much lower during the Paleoindian period, many sites
from this time may be inundated along the coast and in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Paleoindians of North America are considered to have been nomadic big-game hunters.
Their tool sets, the distinctive large fluted projectile points, and extensive lithic assemblage are
considered to be indicative of this type of hunting lifestyle. Due to sea level rise, no Paleoindian

5

coastal camps have been identified within the South Texas region, and only very few have been
identified throughout the greater Gulf of Mexico region. Due to this dearth of evidence, very
little is known concerning Paleoindian use of coastal resources.

Archaic Period (ca. 6000 BC–AD 700)
The Archaic period is marked by evidence of a change in focus from nomadic, big-game hunting
to subsistence-based lifeways. It is usually separated into three chronological stages: Early
(6000–2500 BC), Middle (2500–1000 BC), and Late (1000 BC–AD 700). Human population
density increased gradually during the Archaic period, with a greater reliance on plant
resources and exploitation of both large and small mammals (Hester 1995; Turner and Hester
1999; Versar and Parsons 2008). After modern sea levels stabilized during the Archaic period,
inhabitants of South Texas adapted to the resources found in the estuary bays and gradually
began to establish migratory patterns based on their availability. Excavations in Kleberg County
suggest that the area was once inhabited by several different cultural groups that occupied
sites for short durations, possibly based on their ability to exploit an area’s seasonal hunting,
fishing, and plant-gathering opportunities. However, unlike the bays and lagoons to the north,
Laguna Madre had a very limited amount of shellfish in its waters due to the high levels of
salinity. Therefore, Archaic shell middens, more common to the north, have not been identified
along the Laguna Madre.
Early Archaic
With low population densities, small band sizes, and large territorial ranges continuing from the
Paleoindian period, the Early Archaic is marked mainly by a change in technology. Lanceolate
points disappear and give way to a more diversified tool kit, including a widespread occurrence
of stemmed dart points and the introduction of tools for plant processing (e.g., manos and
metates). Early Archaic point types in Texas include Uvalde, Angostura, Golondrina, and
Abasalo dart points (Turner and Hester 1999; Versar and Parsons 2008). There are two
widespread technological “horizons” from this period: the Early Corner Notched Horizon (ca.
8,000 to 5,500 years ago) includes the Gower and Guadalupe point types, and the Early Basal
Notched Horizon (ca. 5,600 to 5,000 years ago) includes the Bell/Andice points and Clear Fork
unifaces (Hester 1995).
Middle Archaic
The earlier part of the Middle Archaic in South Texas is commonly referred to as Clear Fork,
characterized by a continuation of point types such as Abasalo, as well as by Tortugas, Nolan,
and Travis points (Turner and Hester 1999). The later period is termed Round Rock and is
characterized by somewhat larger and broader stemmed points such as Pedernales, Marshall,
and Langtry (Black 1989; Versar and Parsons 2008). Cemeteries begin toward the end of the
Middle Archaic, as population density increases and territorial ranges become more restricted.
Additionally, there is more intensive use and processing of plants (Hester 1995).

Late Archaic
During the Late Archaic subperiod, climate became closer to that of the present. Human
populations continued to increase, as did restricted territorial ranges and the use of cemeteries.
Archaeological evidence indicates the exploitation of a narrower range of animal species
concurrent with an expansion in the diversity of plant species exploited (Black 1989; Hester
1995; Versar and Parsons 2008). Diagnostic tools of the Late Archaic in South Texas include
small dart points, such as Desmuke and Refugio, and tools with a distinctive distal bevel, such as
Nueces and Olmos (Turner and Hester 1999). Transitional forms of dart points such as Catan,
Ensor, and Matamoros were used at the end of the Archaic and into the early part of the Late
Prehistoric (Turner and Hester 1999).

Late Prehistoric Period (AD 700–1500)
The Late Prehistoric period is marked by Brownsville-Barril cultural complex, which existed
within the extreme southern tip of Texas between AD 1100 and 1700. This region of Texas and
northeastern Mexico was the last area to be explored and settled by the Spanish. Spanish
settlers did not colonize the region until 1747, nearly 150 years after first settling Nuevo Leon
and Coahuila. Accounts from this period indicate that nearly 50 named Indian groups inhabited
the Rio Grande Delta. Archaeological evidence suggests that the basic lifeways observed by the
Spanish had remained unchanged for centuries (Texas Beyond History 2001).
The people of the Brownsville-Barril cultural complex were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who
moved as the seasons and tides dictated. Campsites were located on small rises along the
many bays, lagoons, and estuaries within this semi-arid, semi-tropical environment. They relied
heavily on resources from these waterways, collecting shellfish and fish for food and seashells
for tool resources. Due to the deltaic location, natural stone was practically unavailable as a
raw material in the region, forcing the native peoples to rely on shells for tools, jewelry, and
ornaments. Artifacts from the Brownsville-Barril cultural period exhibit an amazing variety of
shell tools and ornaments including projectile points from conch shell, carved shell pendants,
olive shell bells, shell beads, and many other tool forms (Texas Beyond History 2001).
These artifacts have been identified as important trade goods with cultures farther to the south
in northeastern Mexico and the border of Mesoamerica. Pottery, jade, and obsidian—materials
that are absent from the Rio Grande Delta—were traded from these southern areas to the
Brownsville-Barril peoples. In addition to this specialized shell craft, the Brownsville-Barril
peoples also are notable for their burial practices. Burials associated with this complex were
typically located away from living areas with the deceased buried in a tightly flexed position.
The deceased were buried with a rich assortment of grave goods including the distinct shell
jewelry and tools, as well southern trade goods (Texas Beyond History 2001).
Much of what is known concerning the Brownsville-Barril complex is due to the pioneering
work of Andrew Eliot Anderson, a civil engineer and draftsman from Brownsville, Texas. From
1917 to 1941, Anderson mapped, notated, and collected artifacts from numerous
7

archaeological sites throughout the Rio Grande Delta region. After World War II, much of the
area was altered and disturbed by land clearing, agriculture, and urban development,
destroying many of the sites identified by Anderson. His extensive work is preserved as the
A. E. Anderson Collection and remains a crucial resource for understanding the BrownsvilleBarril peoples (Texas Beyond History 2001).

HISTORIC OVERVIEW
Early Exploration
Brazos Santiago Pass likely was first documented in 1519 when Alonso Álvarez de Pineda made
his exploration of the Gulf Coast (Weddle 1985). A representative of the Spanish in Jamaica,
Álvarez de Pineda sailed with an expedition of four ships, taking notes on Brazos Island and also
areas southward to what is believed to have been the Rio Grande. A Spanish colony was
established in the region in 1520 as a result of this expedition. Though initially the colony
suffered from conflicts with local Native Americans, the Spanish did not lose interest in
colonizing this part of the Gulf Coast. Later, in 1523, Francisco de Garay ventured into the
region to renew Álvarez’s settlement and was carried off course by contrary wind and current,
which led him to discover the Río de las Palmas (modern-day Soto la Marina) (The Handbook of
Texas Online 2011a, 2011b). While the Spanish did not venture another settlement in the
region for over 200 years, they did strive to keep the region from falling into the sphere of
influence of the French and other European powers.
In the 1740s, Spain sent José de Escandón y Elguera on an expedition to the Rio Grande region
in an attempt to spread Spanish influence in the region through settlement and proselytization
of Catholicism. From a foothold on the Rio Grande, Escandon’s settlements spread northward
and generally inland (Weddle 1991). For the next several decades, settlement along the coast
of Texas was discouraged due to the belief that it was an unhealthy region. One early explorer,
Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, termed the Texas coast in 1528 “Malhado or the ‘Isle of
Misfortune,’ in a desolate corner of the Spanish Sea” (reported in Francaviglia 1998:5).
Nevertheless, by the 1770s a village known as Fronton (later Point Isabel/Port Isabel), and by
1788 a village called Brazos Santiago on the northern tip of Brazos Island, had been established
on the coast of Brazos Santiago Pass (Hoyt et al. 1991).

Mexican Rule
The year 1823 was an important one for Brazos Santiago. In that year, the newly independent
Mexican government established the town of Matamoros on the Rio Grande as a port of entry,
a designation that allowed foreign imports and exports to flow in and out of the region. Due to
the shifting bar at the mouth of the Rio Grande, however, the town of Brazos Santiago became
the actual port of entry. There, vessels brought goods through the pass and landed them at the
town’s wharves for overland transport to Matamoros. Period records (examined at length in

Hoyt et al. 1991) note that the bar at Brazos Santiago Pass at this time could admit vessels
drawing up to 2.3 m (7.5 ft) of water. Vessels of deeper draft generally unloaded to lighters
that took goods and supplies to the towns of Brazos Santiago and Port Isabel, or southward to
the Rio Grande. Ranchero Martin de Leon became the first importer of foreign goods in 1823
when he shipped luxury merchandise into the region from New Orleans. By the end of the
1830s, Brazos Santiago had a Mexican military post and a revenue station (Hoyt et al. 1991).
As Matamoros grew into the most active commercial center north of Veracruz, a growing
number of American settlers immigrated to the region. Captain Henry Austin was one of the
early American settlers and, like his counterparts, viewed commercial shipping as a possible
economic pursuit. Austin developed a steamboat line in the late 1820s that operated between
Brazos Santiago and Matamoros. Although Austin’s operation ultimately failed, he laid the
foundation for future operators to reap fortunes in the shipping business along the southern
coast of Texas (Hoyt et al. 1991).
The influx of foreigners, and particularly Americans like Austin, interfered with Mexico’s
hegemony in the Rio Grande region. Tensions erupted in the early 1830s into the Texas
Revolution (1835–1836). In the context of that conflict, the Mexican sloop of war General
Bravo sparred on two occasions with American vessels at Brazos Santiago. Otherwise, the Rio
Grande region was largely removed from the tribulations of the war (Hoyt et al. 1991). Texas
successfully won its independence and existed as the Republic of Texas for a short time
(1836–1845).

Antebellum
The area between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande, which included the important harbor
at Point Isabel, remained disputed territory during the Republic of Texas years. After the
United States annexed Texas in December 1845, Mexico continued to refuse to recognize that
this disputed land was indeed part of the United States, which led to the Mexican War (1846–
1848). General Zachary Taylor brought 4,000 American troops to Point Isabel and adjacent
Brazos Santiago to protect the port and secure the Rio Grande region. The Mexican War
pushed southward into Mexico after May 1846. During the war, the US Army constructed Fort
Brown at present-day Brownsville. The Army also constructed Fort Polk in 1846 at Port Isabel.
Fort Polk, named in honor of the contemporary president of the United States, was garrisoned
from 1848 until 1850 by Captain F. C. Hunt’s Fourth United States Artillery regiment.
Delivery of supplies and troops to Fort Polk required use of Brazos Santiago Pass. General
Taylor therefore established a supply depot at Brazos Santiago shortly after his arrival that
would play a critical role during the Mexican War through which troops, munitions, and
supplies for the frontline were lightered. Major Thomas Eastland, Quartermaster for the
US Army at Brazos Santiago during this period, makes note of numerous buildings at the depot
including warehouses, officers’ and soldiers’ quarters, workshops, a machine shop, and a
foundry, in addition to a shipyard, wharves, a set of ship ways, and a breastwork (reported in
Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:12–13). Shortly after the war, the fort’s buildings were moved to

different locations on the Rio Grande, and most of the infrastructure that was not destroyed in
storms was transferred or sold. A small military presence remained at the depot throughout
the 1850s. This early fort construction represented the vanguard of US military presence at
Point Isabel and Brazos Santiago, and American forays into Mexico (The Handbook of Texas
Online 2011c; Hoyt and Gearhart 1992; Hoyt et al. 1991).
In the interim between the close of the Mexican War and the onset of the American Civil War,
the Brazos Santiago Pass region resumed its earlier role offloading maritime cargoes and
supplying goods to points southward, such as Brownsville and Matamoros. Commercial traffic
through the region had increased to the point that a marine railway was constructed at Brazos
Santiago to facilitate cargo movement. The firm of King, Kenedy, and Company dominated this
traffic, the proceeds from which allowed them to purchase range lands that would become the
famed King Ranch (NRHP 66000820). The villages of Point Isabel and Brazos Santiago
additionally provided goods and supplies to gold prospectors who were bound for the California
Gold Rush of 1848. A US military depot, much smaller than that during the Mexican War,
remained in operation at Brazos Santiago. The survival of the post was ensured as maritime
trade continued to increase in the region. Frequent steamboat traffic in the region fostered the
appearance of saloons and gambling halls. Moreover, the increase in maritime activity
influenced the federal government to construct the Point Isabel Lighthouse (NRHP 76002014)
(Figure 2). Construction began in 1852 and was completed in the following year. Though
visible for 16 miles, the lighthouse reportedly was used more often as a lookout tower (Garza
2011a). Also built at this time was a second lighthouse on the southeastern side of Padre
Island. In the 1860s, yet another navigational aid appeared, a beacon on Brazos Island (later
replaced by an offshore beacon adjacent to the southwest shore of Padre Island) (Garza 2011a,
2011b; Hoyt et al. 1991) (Figure 3).

American Civil War
In March 1861, the steamer Daniel Webster arrived at Brazos Island to evacuate the contingent
of Federal troops at the military post. Texas had seceded from the Union, and the state militia
soon occupied the abandoned post. Through the opening years of the war, Confederate troops
in the region operated with little direct resistance from Union forces. This changed in
November 1863 when Union Major General Nathaniel P. Banks landed 7,000 men at Brazos
Island. Anticipating the landing, Confederate forces had burned all materiel of military value on
the island and retreated inland. They also removed and buried the Port Isabel lighthouse lens
(Garza 2011a). The Union forces next marched on Brownsville, which the Confederates also
burned to prevent the enemy from making use of local resources. After gaining control of the
region, General Francis J. Herron took command of Union forces in the region early in 1864. His
forces soon constructed a short-lived narrow-gauge railroad to carry supplies between his
newly constructed wharf and storehouse and the Rio Grande. By July 1864, Union military
planners decided to abandon the Rio Grande region and reassign troops to the Army of the
Gulf, stationed in New Orleans (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992; Hoyt et al. 1991).

Post-Civil War
In July 1865, Union Major General Philip H. Sheridan landed a force of 27,000 troops on Brazos
Island with the goal of bringing order to the border region, where it was feared that French
Imperialists in Mexico were conspiring with former Confederates to reignite the war with the
United States. No such war erupted, and the troops were later evacuated. During their time on
the island, Army engineers constructed at least 70 distinct buildings, four wharves, and a
railroad to facilitate the transfer of supplies and materiel along the same route serviced by
General Herron’s railroad (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992; Hoyt et al. 1991). “The railroad shortened
freight time to Brownsville by eliminating the need for steam lighters between Brazos Santiago
and the mouth of the Rio Grande” (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992). A hurricane destroyed most of
the buildings and the railroad on the island in 1867, but the area would recover (The Handbook
of Texas Online 2011c).
Maritime trade into the harbor at Brazos Santiago resumed growth in the decade following the
American Civil War. Over 100 vessels were reported visiting the harbor at Brazos Santiago in
1869 alone. The next year witnessed 86 ships call at port. Traffic increased after the Rio
Grande Valley Railroad began operations between Port Isabel and Brownsville in 1871 (Garza
2011b). Also at this time, the federal government sponsored the construction of a wharf
warehouse to facilitate trade activity (Hoyt et al. 1991). In 1875, the brigantine Riene des Mers
sunk in the pass at Brazos Santiago and obstructed maritime traffic until it was partially
removed in 1877. The establishment of a Life Saving Station on Brazos Island in 1880 was a
direct reaction to the increase in maritime activity, and the corresponding increase in maritime
accidents like that of the Riene des Mers (Hoyt et al. 1991).
The need for harbor improvements became vital during this period. After several years of
study, the USACE planned to construct jetties on either side of the pass at Brazos Santiago, a
first step in creating a better port. The south-side jetty was completed in 1883; however,
within a matter of years it had washed away. Several decades later, the USACE had secured
funding for a deepened channel from the pass to Port Isabel, which was completed in 1905. A
turning basin and a railroad wharf additionally were part of the project. LIke the jetty, the
dredged channel was fleeting, as it filled with sand soon after completion (Hoyt et al. 1991). It

was not until the 1930s when the current jetties were completed that the USACE was able to
stabilize the pass and establish a permanent shipping channel (Figure 4). The main navigation
aid, the Port Isabel Lighthouse, was repaired with new lenses in 1866 (as the lenses that the
Confederates had removed during the war were never recovered) and remained in operation
until it was extinguished and abandoned in 1905 (Garza 2011a). In years prior, the light had
gone through periods of nonuse as the United States belatedly sought to acquire title to the
land on which the structure rested (Garza 2011a).

Brownsville surpassed Brazos Santiago and Port Isabel as the economic powerhouse in the
region following the American Civil War. The city was vying for a deepwater connection to the
Gulf of Mexico by 1911; however, World War I intervened and slowed momentum for the
project. By the end of the war in 1918, the people of the region were again calling for federal
support of harbor improvements, particularly a channel from the Gulf of Mexico, through the
pass at Brazos Santiago, and terminating at Port Isabel. Federal and local funding initiated the
project in the 1920s; however, the venture was not successful in clearing a channel through the
pass, and by 1928 work was stopped (Hoyt et al. 1991).
The population of Port Isabel (referred to at times as Point Isabel) steadily grew in the first
three decades of the twentieth century. In the mid-1920s, the population was estimated at
200, with a surge at the end of the decade to 750. Maritime interests in the burgeoning Port
Isabel supported the dredging of a channel from the town to the pass, as well as dredging a
shallow-draft channel around the south and west sides of town. This project was successfully
completed in 1928, the same year Port Isabel was incorporated, even though the larger harbor
improvement project was failing (Garza 2011b).

Federal support for navigational improvements revived in 1930 via the Rivers and Harbors Act.
With new money and the establishment of the Brownsville Navigation District, harbor
improvement through channelization and the construction of supporting infrastructure such as
wharves, docks, and warehouses began. The ship channel to Port Isabel was dredged in 1933 to
3.7 m (12 ft) in depth and 38 m (125 ft) in width. Also opened in the 1930s was the Brownsville
Ship Channel, which finally gave Brownsville its deepwater connection to the Gulf of Mexico. A
stable channel became possible with the completion of the jetties in 1935 (see Figure 4). The
harbor project was considered complete by 1936, while channel maintenance would continue
throughout the life of the channel (Garza 2011b; Hoyt et al. 1991).

World War II to the Present
The coast of Texas was the victim of a powerful hurricane in September 1945. The storm
crashed ashore between Houston and Port Isabel, leaving extensive damage to property and
crops in the region (Tuscaloosa News 1945). Offshore from Port Isabel, two fishermen drowned
after being caught in the storm. These were the only deaths attributed to the storm (The
Telegraph Herald 1945).
One of the most important regional developments of the post–World War II era was the
opening of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) to the Brownsville Ship Channel. The idea
of a protected canal that would span from the northeastern coast of the United States to the
Gulf of Mexico began in 1808 with then Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin’s plan for
government-financed internal improvements. Such a canal, it was thought, would support
maritime commerce on a grand scale. After many decades of piecemeal development at
various places, Texas became the focus of surveys for the proposed canal. Congress sponsored
a survey in 1873 from the western border of Louisiana to the Rio Grande. The USACE was
selected to oversee the completion of the great waterway and submitted a plan for the Texas
leg in 1875. After several more decades and the expansion of oil development along the coast,
interest in the completion of the Texas portion of the waterway was well established
(Leatherwood 2011).
The Beaumont and Galveston areas of the Texas coast were the first to be incorporated into the
waterway system with Congressional support in 1905. By the start of World War II, a channel
of 2.7 m (9.0 ft) in depth and 30 m (98 ft) in width had been extended to Corpus Christi Bay.
The disruption caused by World War II prevented completion of the GIWW to the
Brownsville/Port Isabel area until 1949. The benefits of the GIWW, part of the larger
Intracoastal Waterway of the United States, were soon realized. By the 1960s, 1970s, and
1980s, an average of 65 million tons of goods, from petroleum products to steel, were
transported along the Texas portion of the waterway (Leatherwood 2011). Nearly half a million
tons of import and export cargo were transported through Port Isabel during the 1960s (Garza
2011b). As a result, much effort went into the improvement of the port at Port Isabel during
the postwar era. The Port Isabel Ship Channel was dredged to 11 m (36 ft) in depth and 61 m
(200 ft) in width in 1978 to accommodate the needs of the ever-increasing maritime traffic to

the port. By the end of the decade that followed, a quarter million tons of cargo was being
moved through the port on a yearly basis.
Shrimping became a new industry during the post–World War II era. By 1960, the industry was
well rooted in Port Isabel. Over seven million pounds of shrimp were harvested in that year
alone. Throughout the 1960s, the yearly average burgeoned to approximately 41 million
pounds. Additional postwar industries at Port Isabel included petroleum and fishing. A pipeline
service company, a chemical refinery, and a frozen food company also appeared in this period
and contributed to population growth. Port Isabel had grown to approximately 4,000 residents
by the mid-1960s. Port Isabel’s prosperity was severely disrupted in 1966 when Hurricane
Beulah made landfall. This storm destroyed 15 to 20 percent of the town and left another
25 percent significantly damaged (Garza 2011b). Maritime commerce through the port, as well
as other maritime-related activities such as commercial shrimping and fishing, helped the town
recover, and continue to support the local economy today (Garza 2011b).
Port Isabel was connected to South Padre Island in 1954 via the completion of the first Queen
Isabella Causeway, which spanned the ship channel (Garza 2011b). The opening of the bridge
planted the seed for South Padre Island to grow into a major tourist destination in the region,
with Port Isabel as its gateway (Garza 2011c). The old Queen Isabella Causeway was replaced in
1974 with a more modern structure, while the original bridge was refitted as a fishing pier
(Garza 2011b). On September 15, 2001, a tugboat pushing four barges collided with the
causeway, causing several sections of the bridge to collapse, killing eight people, and severing
the island’s electricity and freshwater supplies. A temporary ferry was installed to carry cars
across the Laguna Madre to and from the island; however, a significant economic impact
resulted from the decline in tourism. The causeway was repaired and reopened in November
2001. Two years later the causeway was renamed the Queen Isabella Memorial Bridge in honor
of the victims (The Brownsville Herald).
South Padre Island, once accessible only by ferry, boomed in the last three decades of the
twentieth century as a result of tourism. Island population numbered little more than 300
people in 1978. By 1988, however, the population had grown to over 1,000. Hotels,
restaurants, condominiums, and souvenir shops now cover what once was a rather barren
landscape (Garza 2011c). Tourism now dominates the island and its economy.
Brazos Island State Scenic Park was established in 1957 on 217 undeveloped acres (88 hectares)
on Brazos Santiago Island (The Handbook of Texas Online 2011d). The park offers fishing,
surfing, swimming, and camping. Area historic sites and parks became offshoots of the growing
tourist industry. Lon C. and Georgiana Hill and the Port Isabel Real Estate Company, owners of
the historic Port Isabel Lighthouse, donated the site to the State of Texas in 1950. The Texas
Parks Board rehabilitated the century-old structure in 1952. Later improvement work was
sponsored by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in 1970 (Garza 2011a).

HISTORIC CHART AND AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW
Historical charts and aerial photographs were reviewed to help understand the historic setting
of the survey area. One of the earliest charts of detail for the area was published in 1883
(US Coast Survey 1883) (Figure 5). This chart shows two lighthouses in the vicinity, one at
Port/Point Isabel and the other off the southwest side of South Padre Island (in the harbor).
The railroad into Port Isabel also is depicted. A circular-shaped island, to the south of the
survey area on the inside of the harbor, is depicted (in a later chart, it is identified as Clark
Island). Structures are indicated on the north side of Brazos Island. An icon resembling a
rowboat (shown on the north side of Brazos Island) may represent a ferry or perhaps a pilot
boat. To the east of the island in the Gulf, a diamond-shaped icon with a point on one side may
represent a floating beacon. A legend was not included in the published 1883 map. Overall,
the survey area itself appears not to be dredged at this date. The western end, in particular,
appears to be quite shallow.
A chart published in 1941 (US Coast Survey 1941) (Figure 6) provides information on how the
survey area had changed in the half century after the 1883 chart. A lighthouse was no longer
located at Port Isabel, whereas the southwest side of South Padre Island remained a lighthouse
site. By 1941, Brazos Santiago Pass had been significantly altered with a jetty on the north and
south sides. The formation of Back Bay on the north end of Brazos Island is one alteration that
occurred as a result of jetty construction. Also, the channel had been dredged, as is indicated
by the dashed lines. Clark Island, which appeared in 1883 as a circular-shaped island, now
appears more like a square due to deposition of material dredged from the pass (Hoyt et al.
1991:114). A curved, dredged channel also now connects Port Isabel to the Brazos Santiago
Channel.
The features seen in the 1941 chart are more visible in the 1955 aerial photograph of the area
(US Geological Survey [USGS] 1955) (Figure 7). A noticeable development in the area since the
1941 chart was the completion of the first Queen Isabella Bridge, which connected Port Isabel
with South Padre Island. This bridge was located to the north of the survey area on the harbor
side and would be replaced in later years with a new bridge that was located farther to the
north. The jetties on either side of Brazos Santiago Pass are visible, as is the ship channel and
Back Bay. The curved ship channel that connects the Brazos Santiago Channel to Port Isabel is
visible. Another pass, known as South Bay Pass, can be seen to the south of the survey area on
the west side of Clark Island. It is unclear whether this pass was dredged or natural as of the
date of this photograph.
The survey area does not appear to have changed remarkably between 1955 and the date of
the next aerial photograph, 1970 (USGS 1970) (Figure 8). The most notable difference in the
1970 aerial photograph is that the western side of Clark Island appears to have eroded where it
meets the South Bay Pass.

PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND RECORDED SITES
As part of the background review, a SEARCH archaeologist reviewed the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online database to identify any previous
surveys or previously identified archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (km) (1.0 mile [mi]) of
the current project area (Figure 9). Five marine surveys have been previously conducted within
or adjacent to the project area. None of the previously conducted surveys identified anomalies
or targets that required further identification within the current project area.
The first survey was conducted in 1987 by Coastal Environmental, Inc., for the USACE at a
dredge disposal area near the Port Isabel small boat harbor channel (Pearson 1987). Numerous
magnetic anomalies were identified during this survey. Only one anomaly was potentially
related to a historic shipwreck; avoidance of this anomaly was recommended.
In 1989 Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. (EH&A) conducted a remote-sensing survey and
diver investigation for the USACE in preparation of dredging activities within the Brownsville
Ship Channel (Bond et al. 1990; Antiquities Permit 859). Twenty anomalies were identified
during this survey, 11 of which were investigated by archaeological divers. The remaining nine
anomalies were not visited; however, they were recommended for further investigation. One
anomaly of the 11 investigated by archaeological divers exhibited historic material and was
recommended for subsequent verification.
In 1990 EH&A conducted an archaeological testing project for the USACE of the anomalies
identified in 1989 within the Brownsville Ship Channel (Hoyt et al. 1991; Antiquities Permit
940). Sixteen previously identified magnetic anomalies were investigated by divers. All
anomalies were determined to be outside the design limits of the channel and therefore would
not be impacted. In addition, the project assessed the potential for intact archaeological
resources within Back Bay, which was formed just south of Brazos Santiago Pass as a result of
the south jetty. This portion of the project included a magnetometer survey and archaeological
diving. A previously unrecorded railroad and a grid of submerged pilings were located. Further
investigations within the bay were recommended.
A follow-up to this survey was conducted by EH&A in 1991 (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992;
Antiquities Permit 1044). This investigation tested anomalies identified during the previous
survey and conducted a second remote-sensing survey of Back Bay, as well as archaeological
Phase II investigations within the bay. A portion of the project was designed to map, utilizing
archival research, cartographic research, and underwater archaeological investigations, the
submerged resources related to the Brazos Santiago Depot (41CF4) NRHP property. A second
goal of the project was to make an NRHP eligibility determination of a potential shipwreck
previously identified at the offshore terminus of the south jetty. The remains of one of the
Brazos Santiago Depot historic railroads and a series of submerged pilings, previously identified
in Back Bay during the 1990 survey, were further investigated during this project. Two
additional sites also were identified: 41CF132, a steel-hull ship located at the outer end of

the south jetty, and 41CF133, a wooden-hull wreck buried under the sand immediately south of
the jetty (Appendix B). Neither of these sites was recommended eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP.
In 2005, Panamerican Consultants, Inc., in support of Prewitt & Associates, Inc., conducted a
remote-sensing survey of proposed channel modifications near Port Isabel for the USACE
(Lydecker and James 2006; Antiquities Permit 3912). Thirty-eight magnetic anomalies and
fifteen side-scan sonar targets were identified during this survey. None of the targets
possessed characteristics indicative of significant cultural resources.
No additional
archaeological work was recommended for this project.

RESEARCH DESIGN
SEARCH developed a predictive model from the environmental characteristics and maritime
history of the region that would help determine the potential for historic shipwrecks near the
project area, as well as their likely design, composition, and age. The remote-sensing data
collected for this project then was processed in a manner that facilitates identifying potential
submerged cultural resources (described below). The predictive model provided a historical
context for the interpretation of the processed remote-sensing data and a tool to help identify
potential submerged cultural resources.

POTENTIAL FOR HISTORIC SHIPWRECKS AND RECOGNIZING THEM IN THE REMOTESENSING RECORD
The region has witnessed historic maritime activity dating to the first Spanish explorations of
the early sixteenth century, and activity that flourished during the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. Prior to the colonies of the late eighteenth century, Spain largely ignored the region.
Maritime traffic was limited to a few enterprises. The likelihood of shipwrecks in the project
area dating to this time period is low. As Matamoros established itself as a Gulf of Mexico port
in the early nineteenth century, and the villages of Brazos Santiago and Port Isabel burgeoned
to support the movement of goods and people inland, maritime traffic in the region
proliferated. There are documented accounts of small vernacular craft, ocean-going sail and
steamships, and cargo lighters visiting the region and utilizing Brazos Santiago Pass beginning in
the 1820s. Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, smaller wooden-hull
sailing vessels were replaced with larger iron and steel workboats powered by steam and then
gasoline engines. The increase in vessel traffic starting in the early 1800s, coupled with
geologic factors such as the sandbar at the pass and climatic factors such as the frequency of
strong northers and hurricanes, increases the potential for wrecking events in the region during
this time period. Later, the creation of various shipping channels in the early twentieth century
focused maritime transportation into narrow corridors; shipwreck events decreased as a result.
The abundance of small wooden-hull sailing vessels utilized for lightering and local
transportation between 1820 and 1900 likely will account for a significant portion of historic
shipwrecks in the region. This category of shipwreck will appear in the remote-sensing data as
relatively smaller, lower-amplitude magnetic anomalies with lower-amplitude gradients. There
likely would exist little to no side-scan sonar image associated with this vessel type due to the
propensity of exposed wood to deteriorate rapidly in a marine environment, and a sufficient
passage of time to bury any remaining structure. Another potential category of historic
shipwrecks in the region is the wooden-hull steamboat. An anomaly associated with this vessel
type would be relatively larger and higher in amplitude, with a corresponding amplitude
gradient. A side-scan sonar target could exist for this vessel type and might consist of exposed
individual or complex concentrations of iron steam-engine components. This image might not

25

be identifiable as a shipwreck due to a lack of surviving exposed hull. The twentieth-century
workboat is another category of shipwreck to expect in the region. This category likely
constitutes a significant percentage of shipwrecks in the area. Many of these shipwrecks will be
located in close proximity to navigation channels. The magnetic anomaly of an iron or steel
vessel propelled with a steam or gasoline engine would be strikingly large and intense, with a
much higher amplitude gradient than other historic vessels. The hull and machinery are more
likely to have survived in some form above the sediment level; therefore, there exists a high
potential of recording a recognizable side-scan sonar image.
Another tool that SEARCH utilized to help identify potential submerged cultural resources
within or adjacent to the project area consists of secondary sources and databases of reported
shipwrecks. These sources include the following:
THC Office of the State Marine Archeologist shipwreck files
Texas Historic Sites Atlas
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Automated Wreck and
Obstruction Information System (AWOIS)
NOAA nautical charts
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement Archaeological
(BOEMRE) Resource Information Database
Global Maritime Wrecks Database (GMWD)
Merchant Vessels of the United States/Merchant Vessel Losses of the United States
SEARCH shipwreck database (assembled from various sources)
Figure 9 above depicts and Appendix C lists shipwrecks that have been reported within 1.6 km
(1.0 mi) of the project area. Many of the shipwrecks are reported in multiple databases and
sometimes with varying positions. Duplication therefore exists within Figure 9; however,
duplicates are removed from Appendix C. Moreover, it is difficult to determine which
shipwrecks listed as “unknown” are duplicated in other databases; therefore, none of these
shipwrecks have been removed from Appendix C. It is important to note that position accuracy
for historic shipwrecks is tentative at best in most instances. Historic shipwrecks generally are
plotted based on contemporary records, maps, or oral histories. Many shipwreck databases
provide a range of position accuracy or an accuracy reliability scale. It must be assumed,
therefore, that Figure 9 and Appendix C do not constitute an exhaustive list of reported
shipwrecks potentially within the buffer zone, nor can it be assumed that every shipwreck truly
resides where it is depicted.

FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Survey
SEARCH conducted initial and close-order remote-sensing surveys for the BIHC Improvement
Project (see Figure 1) following methodology specified in the Texas Administrative Code (Title
13, Part 2, Chapter 28, Rule 28.6). The survey was accomplished under Texas Antiquities Permit
6011 (see Appendix A). Work was conducted from a 6.7-m (22-ft) fiberglass survey vessel.
Environmental conditions throughout the survey consisted of clear skies, light wind (less than
10 knots), and smooth or lightly choppy waters inshore and offshore (less than 0.6 m [2.0 ft]).
Environmental conditions posed no impediments during the survey; however, recreational
fishing vessels between and immediately outside of the jetties forced minor adjustments on
limited occasions. For the most part, vessel guidance proceeded uninterrupted at a speed that
averaged 4.5 knots. One hundred percent data coverage of the project area was obtained with
all instruments.
Instrumentation for the survey consisted of a Trimble DSM 232 differentially corrected global
positioning system receiver (DGPS); a Marine Magnetics Explorer Overhauser total-field
magnetometer; an L-3 Klein System 3000 dual-frequency (100/500 kHz) digital side-scan sonar;
and a Garmin 160C echosounder (200 kHz). Vessel guidance was accomplished utilizing
HYPACK, Inc. hydrographic survey software. HYPACK also maintained equipment positioning
throughout the survey, by means of layback calculations, and logged real-time positional,
magnetic, and bathymetric data (Appendix D). Layback positions for the magnetometer and
side-scan sonar towfish varied with water depth. As water depth increased beyond 7.6 m (25
ft), east of channel station 1+500, the layback for these instruments increased in order to
maintain a maximum altitude of 6.1 m (20 ft). The side-scan sonar operated at a frequency of
500 kHz and a range of 25 m (82 ft) (i.e., total swath width = 50 m [164 ft]) while surveying in
shallow water. The combination of survey line spacing and range allowed for 100 percent
imagery coverage of the project area, including the nadir region beneath the towfish path. East
of channel station 1+500 range was adjusted to 37 m (121 ft) to compensate for the higher
towfish altitudes and ensure that 100 percent coverage was maintained in the deeper water.
The DGPS was interfaced with the sonar topside acquisition computer, which embedded
positional data into the imagery and allowed geo-rectification of the sonar record. Sonar
imagery was collected at a constant stream while positional, magnetic, and bathymetric data
were collected at a rate of 1 Hz. The survey was conducted in the Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) coordinate system (Zone 14N) based on the NAD83 datum.
SEARCH designed the survey with guidance from the USACE Staff Archeologist and THC survey
standards (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 28, Rule 28.6). Initially this
consisted of six parallel survey lines spaced 20 m (66 ft) apart, three on either side of the
channel originating at the toe of the channel. Because survey lines originated at the toe of the
channel, the survey collected data within the channel proper. SEARCH subsequently altered
this design by adding a fourth survey line on either side of the channel extending the entire

project length. A fifth survey line of magnetometer and echosounder coverage only was added
to the project area west of the jetties (Figure 10). Sonar imagery was not collected due to
shallow water depths (coverage from the adjacent line extended across this fifth line). A total
of 76 km (47 line miles) were surveyed.
Following the initial survey, SEARCH completed a cursory magnetic contour map, in the field, to
determine the presence or absence of suspect anomalies within the project area. SEARCH
selected anomalies that potentially represent submerged cultural resources and subjected
them to a secondary, close-order survey without remobilizing. Close-order survey was
designed to collect additional magnetic data and thereby refine the suspect anomalies.
Additional data points further clarify anomaly characteristics and facilitate archaeological
interpretation. Equipment for the close-order survey included that listed for the initial survey,
sans the side-scan sonar, and survey methodology followed the same procedures. Highresolution imagery was collected across 100 percent of each suspect anomaly during the initial
survey. Additional lines were surveyed between the initial track lines at each suspect anomaly,
thereby creating a data set of track lines spaced 10 m (33 ft) apart when combined with the
initial magnetic data. Additional lines, spaced 10 m (33 ft) apart, were surveyed in a
perpendicular direction to the initial track lines, where conditions permitted. Close-order
survey of one anomaly (M5, discussed below) was not conducted due to the presence of a
charter fishing boat anchored at the locale during the time of survey, as well as anglers fishing
the locale from the jetty.

Local Informant Interviews
SEARCH archaeologists interviewed several local informants, following initial survey and prior to
close-order survey, in order to attain information that might elucidate the identities of the
suspect anomalies. Local informants who were interviewed include staff from the following
commercial operations:
American Diving
Captain Murphy’s Deep Sea Fishing
Sea Ranch Marina

REMOTE-SENSING DATA PROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION METHODOLOGY
Magnetometer
The raw magnetic data (x, y positional coordinates + z magnetic values) were processed into a
contour map, which allows the best representation of three-dimensional data on a twodimensional plane and facilitates interpretation of the interaction of a magnetic source with the
earth’s magnetic field. The process involved with creating this contour map consists of
removing the diurnal variation from the data, creating a regularly spaced grid of the irregularly

spaced data points, and generating contours that are visually concise and accurately represent
anomalies in the earth’s magnetic field.
The earth’s background magnetic value at any particular geographic location fluctuates slightly
from day to day and throughout each day. This variation is evident in the raw magnetometer
data (z value) and results in a cluttered map when contoured. In order to overcome this,
SEARCH filtered the raw magnetometer data through a mathematical algorithm. The algorithm
defines each raw z value as either higher than the magnetic background (positive) or lower than
the magnetic background (negative). The algorithm replaces the raw z value with this positive
or negative number, which is relative to the magnetic background at the particular date, time,
and geographic location it was recorded. The diurnal variation is easily identified and removed
from the relative z values, which facilitates contouring and provides a “clean” contour map.
The x, y, and relative z data were imported into Golden Software, Inc.’s Surfer contouring and
3-D surface mapping software. SEARCH instructed Surfer to grid the processed magnetic data
based on data collection methodology and magnetic theory as it applies to the correlation
between source amplitude and its distance from the magnetometer sensor. The inline distance
between raw data points, based on the rate of collection (1 Hz) and the average survey vessel
speed during data collection (4.5 knots), equates to approximately 2.32 m (7.6 ft). Data were
collected along parallel survey lines spaced approximately 20 m (66 ft) apart. Based on these
parameters, SEARCH’s Surfer gridline geometry was set at 2.32 m (7.6 ft) between nodes, with a
search ellipse of 1.5 times the survey line distance (i.e., 30 m [98 ft]). SEARCH selected a
gridding interpolation method following the magnetic theory that magnetic amplitude
decreases inversely proportional to the cube of the distance between the source and the
magnetometer sensor (Breiner 1999). The resulting magnetic data grid consists of regularly
spaced data nodes interpolated from the irregularly spaced magnetometer data. SEARCH next
contoured the filtered relative magnetometer data using the interpolated magnetic data grid.
Contour interval was set at 5 gammas ( ) with 100- index contours. The contours illustrated in
the figures in the Results chapter below and in Appendix E present 5- positive contours as
orange and negative contours as light blue. Index contours are illustrated in red (positive) and
dark blue (negative).
Previous research concerning magnetic theory as it applies to archaeological resources and
remote-sensing survey (e.g., Breiner 1999; Enright et al. 2003, 2006; Garrison et al. 1989;
Gearhart 2004, 2011; VonFrese 1986) assisted SEARCH’s interpretation of the processed
magnetic data and helped to identify potential shipwreck anomalies. Research has
demonstrated that the complex distributions of a typical vessel’s many ferromagnetic
components tend to cancel one another in the shipwreck’s contoured magnetic signature and
present a relatively simple pattern as a whole. The composite magnetic signature of a complex
source such as a shipwreck consists of the permanent magnetism of each individual
ferromagnetic component plus the relatively weaker induced magnetism caused by the earth’s
magnetic field. Even though the permanent magnetism of the individual components alone
would dominate the weaker earth-induced magnetism, a complex concentration of numerous
magnetic anomalies overlapping one another tends to minimize or negate the permanent
Research Design

Final Technical Report

magnetism of individual ferromagnetic objects, leaving a composite anomaly dominated by the
earth-induced signature. As such, a shipwreck anomaly tends to exhibit a general dipolar
pattern (i.e., a positive lobe and a negative lobe) where the polar axis is dominated by the
earth-induced portion of the composite and therefore aligns itself with the earth’s magnetic
field, regardless of site orientation. As such, the majority of negative contours are oriented in
the northern half of a shipwreck anomaly, while the majority of positive contours are situated
to the south. The polar axis of the principal dipole (the magnetic vector from positive peak to
negative peak) is oriented toward magnetic north, within ±26 degrees.
Site formation processes and decreased distance between sensor and source will alter this
arrangement somewhat and induce a more complex anomaly. Surveys that decrease the
sensor-to-shipwreck distance (e.g., shallow-water survey) will produce a complex,
multicomponent anomaly comprising multiple monopoles and dipoles within the induced
anomaly pattern. This occurrence is exacerbated with shipwrecks consisting of copious
amounts of iron or large ferrous construction features or machinery (e.g., an iron-hull
steamship). Gearhart (2011:104) states that when magnetic survey occurs “in close proximity
to a shipwreck, localized amplitude peaks associated with large individual ferromagnetic
components may contrast with the surrounding induced anomaly pattern of the shipwreck as a
whole.” However, the anomaly will still exhibit the broader, underlying induced pattern
described above.
Site formation processes also can induce complexity outside of the principal dipole. For
example, a large iron feature, such as a boiler, that has been deposited away from the main
shipwreck site can produce a separate magnetic signature that adds complexity to the
characteristics of the shipwreck anomaly as a whole. Or, a site formation process that has
included radical seabed movement, or scrambling devices, that result in what Muckelroy
(1978:196) terms a “discontinuous site,” can alter anomaly patterns. Scrambling devices that
can produce a discontinuous site include strong tidal currents and extreme wave action,
occurrences exacerbated in shallow water. Such a site can produce widely distributed ship
components and anomalies with large areal extents. Depending on the level of distribution, a
principal dipolar anomaly may or may not exist for a discontinuous site.
Polar alignment and complexity of the anomaly are perhaps the most important characteristics
to consider when interpreting magnetic data for potential shipwrecks. Other characteristics
that help distinguish shipwreck magnetic signatures from other signatures (e.g., capped
petroleum wells and debris) include the peak-to-peak amplitude gradient, the negative-topositive amplitude ratio, and continuity. Continuity helps to differentiate a shipwreck, which is
a complex distribution of objects, from debris fields, which also are complex distributions of
objects. Shipwrecks possess more continuity among their central dipoles than do debris fields.
Shipwrecks tend to possess peak-to-peak amplitude gradients higher than petroleum wells and
a more equal amplitude distribution between their poles. Known examples of shipwreck
magnetic signatures from Gearhart (2004) possess amplitude ratios less than 1:4. Examples of
wooden-hull sailing vessels possess gradients, between their poles, from 15 to 30 /m, and

31

examples of iron/steel and/or steam/gasoline-powered vessels possess gradients above
100 /m (Gearhart 2004).

Side-Scan Sonar
SEARCH reviewed each line of raw side-scan sonar imagery from the survey to locate manmade features and potential submerged cultural resources protruding above the seafloor. Each
object was assigned a contact number, and descriptive information was collected and tabulated
(e.g., length, width, DGPS position, possible identification, etc.) (Appendix F). SEARCH also
generated a mosaic image of the project area comprising all raw sonar imagery (Figure 11).
Large-scale maps of the sonar mosaic are included in Appendix G. The ability to mosaic the
imagery was made possible with embedded positional data from the DGPS data string utilizing
SonarWiz.Map V5.03.0016 sonar processing software. High-frequency imagery files (500 kHz)
were imported into the software utilizing settings adjusted for the Klein System 3000
acquisition methods. Following importation of the raw imagery, bottom tracking was
performed to identify the first acoustic return, which determines the altitude of the towfish
above the seafloor, creates a slant-range corrected record, and removes the water column
from the nadir region. Returns from the overlapping files were averaged. Thus, if a target
contrasts well on one track line but not on an adjacent line, averaged returns from both lines
ensure significant contrast for target detection. Gain, color, and contrast settings were
adjusted for each file in order to produce an optimal and even image across the entire mosaic.
The mosaic was exported as a geo-rectified image with a resolution of 0.05 m/pixel
(0.16 ft/pixel) and imported into ArcGIS 10 so that it could be layered with other project data
(e.g., magnetic contour map, project boundary, etc.) and facilitate archaeological analysis.

Bathymetry
Bathymetry was collected solely for future archaeological planning purposes. As such, no
processing of these data occurred.

RESULTS
SIDE-SCAN SONAR RESULTS
Eighty unique contacts were identified in the sonar record and one grouping of submerged
pilings classified as a single feature (see Appendix F). Most of these contacts are identifiable
(e.g., channel markers, pipe, tires, etc.), and a few remain unidentified. The unidentifiable
contacts that may represent potentially significant submerged cultural resources are described
in the discussions below.

MAGNETOMETER RESULTS
SEARCH integrated magnetic data from both the initial and close-order surveys and contoured
the combined data set. Magnetic anomaly characteristics described above were analyzed, and
the historical predictive model presented in the Research Design was considered for every
magnetic anomaly, and side-scan sonar contact, recorded on this project. The magnetic data
processing methodology that SEARCH employed allowed a direct comparison of characteristics
to similarly contoured magnetic data of verified shipwrecks. Every anomaly was interpreted for
its similarity to anomalies of known shipwrecks. Numerous magnetic anomalies exist within the
project area, as can be expected adjacent to a navigable ship channel. Initial processing and
analysis of these anomalies in the field resulted in the selection of six anomalies (M1–M6) for
an additional, refined close-order magnetometer survey (see Appendix E). These anomalies
were selected because of characteristics similar to verified shipwreck anomalies. During
subsequent research and a comparison to previous investigations, SEARCH identified four
additional anomalies that require discussion (M7–M10).
All remaining anomalies can be attributed to known sources (e.g., channel markers) or are
generated by modern debris sources. SEARCH compared the unidentifiable anomalies that
occur within the EH&A 1989 project perimeter to that investigation’s magnetic data and found
no corresponding anomalies. Thus, SEARCH can state that the terminus post quem for these
anomalies is 1989. SEARCH additionally researched the Railroad Commission of Texas database
of pipelines and wells and found no pipelines or wells within or crossing the project area that
correlate to any anomaly.
The magnetic data in the following images have been contoured at a 5- interval. These data
present negative contours in light blue with 100- index contours in dark blue, and positive
contours in orange with 100- index contours in red. Side-scan sonar contacts are illustrated as
green diamonds, while vessel track lines are displayed as gray dots. A table of anomaly
statistics for those discussed is provided in Appendix H.

Anomaly M2
Anomaly M2 (Figure 14 and Appendix E, Sheet 4) shares characteristics with verified shipwreck
anomalies. A review of the sonar imagery at this locale reveals what appears to be the partial
outline of a boat hull (approximately 11.3 m [37 ft] long) (Figure 15). SEARCH hypothesizes that
if this is the image of a boat hull, it is a modern fiberglass hull. EH&A recorded an anomaly (GG)
at this locale in 1989 (Bond et al. 1990). Subsequent underwater archaeological investigation
identified the source of Anomaly GG as a steel “strap” approximately 10 cm (3.9 in) wide and
60 cm (24 in) long, and a “modern” cable measuring 1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter and
approximately 25 cm (9.8 in) long (Hoyt et al. 1991). EH&A archaeologists removed these
objects and conducted another magnetometer survey over the locale, which “registered no
anomaly”; it is unknown whether the strap and cable were returned to the locale. A
comparison of Anomaly GG and Anomaly M2 illustrates their differing characteristics and
suggests different sources (Figure 16). It appears that pure coincidence has deposited a second
ferrous object(s) at precisely the Anomaly GG location; therefore, the terminus post quem for
Anomaly M2 is 1990.

Anomaly M3
Anomaly M3 (Figure 17 and Appendix E, Sheet 2) is adjacent to a peninsula of South Padre
Island that incorporates Isla Blanca Park. This peninsula has been reinforced with concrete
blocks in order to stabilize the shoreline (Figure 18). Water depths immediately adjacent to the
peninsula drop off quickly into the Brownsville Ship Channel. The peak amplitudes of
Anomaly M2 are located on the channel slope in approximately 6.1 to 9.1 m (20 to 30 ft) of
water, with its center in 8.5 m (28 ft) of water (Figure 19). The sonar imagery reveals what
appear to be several concrete blocks (Contact S0060) that have slipped partially down the
channel slope into 6.1 to 9.1 m (20 to 30 ft) of water (Figure 20). These blocks are not the
source of Anomaly M3; however, no additional sonar contacts are visible at this locale.
Anomaly M3 potentially is associated with this shoreline stabilization, which likely includes
ferrous material (e.g., rebar). Anomaly M3 is a complex multicomponent anomaly with a
relatively large areal extent; however, increased complexity and size are not defining
characteristics of known shipwreck anomalies (see Research Design). Anomaly M3 is not
indicative of a shipwreck source, as it does not fit the model of a shipwreck magnetic signature
when all of its characteristics are considered collectively. Anomaly M3, moreover, is located on
the channel slope, and although this does not preclude a shipwreck, its source currently is
below historic water depths.

Anomaly M4 (Figure 21 and Appendix E, Sheet 2) shares characteristics with verified shipwreck
anomalies. A review of the sonar imagery at this locale reveals nothing protruding above the
sediment level. EH&A recorded a portion of this anomaly in 1989 and designated it Anomaly S
(Bond et al. 1990). Subsequent underwater archaeological investigation identified the source
of Anomaly S as a “hollow steel structure approximately 5 m [16 ft] long and 1 m [3.3 ft] in
square cross section” (Hoyt et al. 1991). The entire object was “covered with a thin layer of
concretion,” and one end was “twisted and broken.” Beneath the concretion EH&A
archaeologists noted a lack of corrosion or pitting on the surface, suggesting a “relatively short
period of submersion.” EH&A determined that the object should not be considered historically
significant.

Anomaly M5
Anomaly M5 (Figure 22 and Appendix E, Sheet 2) is located at the offshore terminus of the
south jetty. The positive lobe of this anomaly extends approximately 12 m (39 ft) beyond the
toe of the channel (i.e., into the channel proper). The full extent of the negative lobe may not
have been recorded, as this portion of anomaly exists on an outside track line. Several
shipwrecks are reported in the vicinity of the south jetty terminus, many of which are known to
be modern. Four unknown wrecks are reported from various sources near the south jetty.
SEARCH interviewed a local charter fishing boat captain who stated that two modern
commercial shrimp trawlers were intentionally scuttled at the end of the south jetty for the
purpose of artificial reef creation. A review of the sonar imagery at this locale reveals two
unidentified contacts in association with Anomaly M5 (Figures 23 and 24). One contact
measures approximately 6.7 x 2.0 m (22 x 6.6 ft) and stands 1.8 m (6 ft) above the seafloor. The
second contact measures approximately 4.3 x 1.67 m (14 x 5.5 ft) and stands 1.4 m (4.6 ft)
above the seafloor. These contacts contribute to the structure of Anomaly M5; however, they
are not the main source of the anomaly.

EH&A recorded a portion of this anomaly in 1989 and designated it Anomaly X (Bond et al.
1990). SEARCH geo-referenced the EH&A image of Anomaly X (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:85)
into the project geographic information system (GIS) to illustrate its correlation with
Anomaly M5 (Figure 25). Subsequent underwater archaeological investigation identified the
primary source for Anomaly X as “a group of large steel plates wedged among the jetty rocks
near the outer end of the south jetty,” with a section of cable and an isolated jetty capstone
contributing (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:129). The steel plates “appeared to be hull plates but
positively identifiable characteristics were absent” (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:84). EH&A
archaeological divers utilized visual and mechanical investigative methods and located “no
obstructions indicating possible cultural resources” (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:86). One of the
sonar contacts imaged in the current survey likely correlates with the isolated jetty capstone
investigated in 1991. The second contact also may be jetty-related material.

EH&A research tentatively assigns a terminus post quem to the initial site formation at 1953
and a terminus ante quem of 1970.
The steel hulled vessel which wrecked here has not been identified. However,
the position of the plates indicates that it probably wrecked after the jetties
were constructed in the early 1930s. A wreck symbol appears at this location on
the latest USGS quad map (Port Isabel, Texas; USGS 7.5' Series, 1955,
photorevised 1983). The vessel apparently wrecked prior to 1970, as it does not
appear as a photorevision on the earlier edition of the 1955 map photorevised in
1970. Either the wreck dates prior to 1955, when the map was produced, or it
first appeared on a photorevision between 1955 and 1970. At least three vessels
listed in the TAC [Texas Antiquities Committee, now THC] wreck files as lost in
this area between 1935, when the jetties were completed, and 1965 could
qualify as this wreck: the Palmetto, 1954 (TAC #35); the Amiga Mia, 1954
(TAC #125); and the Cavalier, 1965 (TAC #169). Several other vessels with more
vague descriptions may qualify as well. Oddly enough, no wrecks appear on the
list for this area between 1933 and 1953, suggesting that the wreck did not occur
before 1953 (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:129).
EH&A did not establish a historical significance for the shipwreck remains; however, the THC
(then TAC) requested that it be designated an archaeological site and assigned a trinomial
(41CF132). The THC archaeological site form states that the site is not eligible for listing in the
NRHP (see Appendix B).

Anomaly M6
Anomaly M6 (Figure 26 and Appendix E, Sheet 4) shares characteristics with verified shipwreck
anomalies; however, it is located at the bottom of the Brownsville Ship Channel, beneath
historic water depths, in approximately 12.2 m (40 ft) of water (Figure 27). The wreck of the
Campesino, a fishing vessel reported lost in 1983, is plotted approximately 122 m (400 ft) north
of Anomaly M6 (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas). The positional accuracy of this wreck is listed
as 1 mile (1.6 km), which means she could correlate with Anomaly M6. A review of the sonar
imagery at this locale reveals nothing protruding above the sediment level, which should be
expected with a modern vessel. SEARCH believes that the source of this anomaly is modern
debris that was deposited after the creation of the channel.

EH&A recorded a portion of Anomaly M7 (Figure 28 and Appendix E, Sheet 3) in 1989 and
designated it Anomaly R (Bond et al. 1990). The side-scan sonar imagery at this locale reveals a
series of submerged wooden pilings (Figure 29). EH&A additionally identified, in 1990,
associated pilings on the adjacent shoreline. Modern aerial photography, 1939 aerial
photography, and underwater archaeological investigations in 1989, 1990, and 1991
determined that this is the location of a collapsed pier, constructed in the early 1930s, to
support the jetty railroad atop a wharf at this locale (see Figure 4). EH&A concluded that (Hoyt
et al. 1991:122):
the jetty construction railroad is not considered to be historically significant, and
it was not cited as a contributing element to the Brazos Santiago Depot National
Register property [41CF4]. The wharf end of the railroad at Anomaly R [M7] is
actually outside of the boundaries of the National Register property.

Anomalies M8 and M9
EH&A recorded portions of Anomalies M8 and M9 (Figure 30 and Appendix E, Sheet 2) in 1989
and designated them Anomalies T and V (Bond et al. 1990). EH&A archaeological divers
identified the sources for Anomalies T and V (M8 and M9) as disarticulated railroad rails and
postulated that they were displaced from Major General Philip Sheridan’s 1865 military railroad
during the hurricane of 1867 (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:130). The current survey imaged these
rails in the side-scan sonar (Figure 31). Due to the loss of provenience, their historical
significance was considered reduced and no additional archaeological investigation was
recommended. In the intervening years, it is clear from a comparison of anomalies recorded in
the current survey with those recorded in 1989 (Figure 32) that these two sites have been
further impacted, especially Anomaly M8 (T). Contact S0097 (Anomaly M8 [T]) at first review
appears to be a length of cable; however, EH&A divers identified a “twisted rail” at this locale
(Hoyt et al. 1991:80), a description that matches Contact S0097 (Figure 33).

Anomaly M10
Anomaly M10 (Figure 34 and Appendix E, Sheet 2) appears to be an extension of the linear
anomaly recorded by EH&A in Back Bay in 1991 (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:89). None of EH&A’s
magnetometer surveys covered this particular locale; however, based on archaeological
investigation and historical research, summarized here, this seems a likely hypothesis. EH&A’s
archaeological investigations determined that the source for this anomaly is the General Francis
J. Herron 1864 railroad line. Archaeologists identified nearly 548.5 m (1,800 ft) of railroad track
in Back Bay.
The buried railroad track enters Back Bay from beneath the south jetty along the
southeastern side of the bay. How far the track extends beneath the island east
of the jetty has yet to be determined. The track curves gradually to the
northwest as it crosses the bay. Near the western margin of the bay it seems to
branch in two directions. One branch of the track terminates beneath the beach
along the bay’s west side. A second branch continues to the northwest corner of
Back Bay toward a stone dike. The dike, probably constructed along the north
shore of Brazos Island in 1927 (Alperin 1977:141), now extends into Back Bay.
The end of the rails in the direction of the dike has not been verified (Hoyt and
Gearhart 1992:95).

Figure 34. Anomaly M10.

Although SEARCH was unable to obtain the magnetic data from EH&A’s surveys to overlay with
the current survey, coordinates for the rails identified during the Phase II underwater
investigations are known. SEARCH additionally geo-referenced EH&A’s Back Bay magnetic
contour map into the project GIS. Figure 35 plots the rail locations and provides a rough
historic course for the rail line based on EH&A’s archival and cartographic research, magnetic
survey, and Phase II investigations. As quoted above, the northern terminus of the rail line is
unknown, but it most likely continues toward the northwest corner of Back Bay. SEARCH
hypothetically extended the rail line based upon the direction determined from archaeological
investigation (see Figure 35). This hypothetical continuation of the rail line crosses close to
Anomaly M10, suggesting that this locale may be the unverified “end of the rails” for the
second branch described by EH&A. Side-scan sonar imagery depicts what may be disarticulated
rails (Figure 36 and 37).
Several key pieces of circumstantial evidence suggest that Anomaly M10 is an extension of
General Francis J. Herron’s 1864 railroad associated with the Brazos Santiago Depot NRHP
property (41CF4):
the location of Anomaly M10 in-line with the diver verified railroad route and the linear
magnetic anomaly recorded over the railroad by EH&A;

the similarities of sonar contacts S0095 and S0120 (M10) to contacts S0096 (M8 [T]) and
S0097 (M9 [V]), which have been diver verified as rails;
the location of two additional diver-verified rails to the north of Anomaly M10 (see
Figure 35); and
the fact that EH&A did not survey this area, nor were they able to locate the “end of the
rails.”
There exists a discrepancy between the NRHP property boundary and the THC archaeological
boundary for 41CF4. Anomaly M10 falls within the archaeological boundary but outside the
NRHP boundary; however, its location within or without a particular boundary does not negate
its historical significance.

RECOMMENDATIONS
SEARCH successfully completed initial and close-order archaeological surveys for the BIHC
Improvement Project, along with accompanying data processing and analyses. SEARCH also
conducted historical, environmental, and cartographic research, reviewed previous
archaeological investigations, and identified known and reported cultural resources. All project
data have been incorporated into a GIS geo-database for organization, future scientific
analyses, presentation, and archiving purposes.
SEARCH’s marine archaeological Phase I survey for the BIHC Improvement Project has identified
numerous magnetic anomalies and side-scan sonar contacts. All but one target, Anomaly M10,
have been identified as known sources or modern debris. Anomalies M5, M7, M8, and M9 are
historic resources; however, they have been determined not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Cultural resources clearance is recommended for these anomalies and side-scan sonar contacts.
It is likely that the source of Anomaly M6 is modern debris; however, there is a possibility that it
is the wreck of the modern fishing vessel Campesino. This vessel is not eligible for listing in the
NRHP. SEARCH does not recommend additional archaeological investigation of this anomaly,
and recommends cultural resources clearance.
Anomaly M10 potentially is a submerged cultural resource associated with the Brazos Santiago
Depot (41CF4). SEARCH tentatively has identified the source of this anomaly as one end of the
railroad line built in 1864 by General Francis J. Herron. EH&A archaeologists describe the
articulated rails within Back Bay as “an example of a well-preserved resource” in its original
position (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:131). EH&A attributes its preservation and integrity to its
mass, and states that “its sheer weight and length have allowed it to settle into the bottom
sediments with little distortion from erosional forces” (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:131). Hoyt and
Gearhart go on to state that indirect impacts to submerged cultural resources in the bay as a
result of ship channel dredging have occurred; however, the rail line has been “protected from
indirect impacts by its mass” (1992:131). There is no reason to believe that this will not
continue with the deepening and widening proposed in the current BIHC Improvement Project.
SEARCH has depicted an avoidance margin of 50 m (164 ft) around Anomaly M10 (see
Appendix E, Sheet 2), as prescribed by the THC in the Texas Administrative Code (Title 13, Part
2, Chapter 28, Rule 28.6, Paragraph e.1.A.i). The avoidance margin may affect the current
proposed project design. SEARCH contends that this avoidance margin, which typically is
applied for the protection of potential shipwreck sites, may not be necessary for Anomaly M10.
The rail line represented by Anomaly M10 is unlike a shipwreck in that it is not composed of
many unique components distributed over a relatively large areal extent. It is a compact, welldefined object that is represented in the magnetic record by the central portion of the anomaly.
As such, there is no concern that portions of the resource might lie outside the perimeter of the
anomaly. The BIHC Improvement Project requires 30 m (98 ft) from the toe of the existing
channel for potential impacts (USACE, personal communication 2011). Anomaly M10 is located
approximately 57.3 m (188 ft) south of the Brownsville Ship Channel toe. Construction impacts

contained within the 30.5-m (100-ft) corridor will have no adverse affects on Anomaly M10. If
it becomes problematic to contain impacts within a 30.5-m (100-ft) corridor, or if the THC
determines that adjustment to the avoidance margin is not justified, SEARCH recommends
additional archaeological testing of Anomaly M10, conducted by qualified maritime
archaeologists, in order to determine definitively whether or not its source is associated with
the 1864 rail line. Testing can occur under the auspices of the current Texas Antiquities Permit
(6011).
Should unanticipated cultural finds occur during the project construction phase, SEARCH
recommends cessation of work until the THC is consulted and a determination of the
significance of the finds can be made.
