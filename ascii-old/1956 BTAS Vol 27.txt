ARCHEOLOGICAL MATERIALS FROM FIVE
ISLANDS IN THE LAGUNA MADRE,
TEXAS COAST
T. N.

CAMPBELL

In the central section of the Texas coast two cultural units
have been recognized, the Aransas Focus, which has been
assigned to the Archaic Stage, and the Rockport Focus,
which has been assigned to the Neo-American Stage (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, pp. 121-128). The Aransas Focus
is known chiefly from two excavated sites on Aransas Bay
(Campbell, 1947, 1952); but the Rockport Focus is known
only from brief reports of archeological survey work (Martin, n. d., 1929, 1931; Potter, 1930; Sayles, 1935); from excavated Aransas Focus sites with small Rockpor.t components
(Campbell, ibid.); and from supplementary data included
in the Handbook (Suhm, et al., 1954). In the archeological
literature it is not possible to find a single description of an
isolated Ro·c kport Focus component, based either on excavation or a large surface collection. It is evident that the
Rockport Focus needs documentation.
The purpose of this paper is to report archeological materials from five islands located at the northern end of the
Laguna Madre in Nueces County, Texas. These materials
are derived both from surface collections (1929 to present)
and from excavation (1933), but for the latter materials
the methods of control used in excavation do not meet current standards. Nevertheless, the collections from these five
sites clearly indicate an Aransas as well as a Rockport occupation. The evidence documents an extension of the Aransas
Focus farther south on the Texas coast, and it also adds
much detail to our knowledge of the content of the Rockport Focus.
The five islands are located (Fig. 1) just south of Corpus
Christi Bay, which is connected with the Laguna Madre, a
narrow body of water that lies between enormously long
Padre Island and the Texas mainland. Flour Bluff marks
the entrance into the Laguna Madre. Just south of Flour

8

Texas Archeological Society

Bluff a chain of small, low-lying islands closely parallels
the mainland shore for a distance of three or four miles.
These islands are in the extreme eastern part of Nueces
County, some 10 or 12 miles southeast of downtown Corpus
Christi and just east and southeast of the Corpus Christi
Nav·a l Air Base. Most of .t he available maps show at least
seven islands in the chain, but there are also a number of
islets that do not show. On five of the seven larger islands
archeological sites have been reported. These sites, from
north to south, are designated as follows: Site 77B5-13 (Indian Island), Site ?7B5-1 (W~bb Island), Site 77B5-2, Site
77B8-6, and Site 77B8-7.
Archeological sites on this chain of islands have been
briefly and somewhat casually reported in three publications by George C. Martin and Wendell H. Potter, who
visited the islands and made surface collections during the
course of an archeological survey, 1927-1929. Only one site
is descri:bed, an unidentified island at the northern end of
the chain whose surface was littered with fractured pebhles,
flint flakes, and potsherds (Martin, 1929, p. 51). Mention is
made, without specifying any particular island, that human
skulls and various long bones had been exposed by wave
action (ibid., p. 50). Both Martin and Potter provide scattered references, along with ·a few illustrations, to specimens
collected from sites on these islands. Except for two specimens of pottery, the specific provenience of these objects is
not given. The list is brief 1b ut illuminating in a general
way. It includes a bone or shell pendant (Martin, 1929, p.
54); a cylindrical pebble with an encircling groove near one
end (ibid.); two flint drills, one with an irregularly shaped
stem (Martin and Potter, n. d., Par.t 1, plate at left, specimen No. 4), the other bipointed and with a triangular cross
section (Martin, 1929, p. 56); eight small flint arrow points:
four Perdiz points,* one Fresno point, two Starr points, and
one broadly lanceolate point with straight base (Martin and
Potter, n. d., Part 2, plate at left and plate at right, specimens

points; one Abasolo point (ibid., plate at left, No. 12), one
rechipped Lange point (ibid., No. 9), and one Pedernales
point (ibid., No. 16).
The two specimens of pottery, referred to above, were
collected on Webb Island (also called Arrowhead Island).
One is a portion of the neck of a vessel which had an internal
flange "on which a lid could rest" (Potter, 1930, p. 40). The
second specimen, a hemispherical bowl of Rockport Blackon-Gray, is of considerable importance .because it is one of
the few complete vessels of this type ever reported. Wavy
lines extend downward from the lip, which is also painted.
This bowl is stated to have been "plowed up" on Arrowhead
Island (ibid., Plate 8, Fig. 15).
Fourteen flint artifacts from these islands in the Laguna
Madre were donated to the University of Texas by George
C. Martin in 1930. The specific island from which each
specimen came is unknown. The collection includes one
Desmuke dart point, one Catlin dart point, a small flake
knife, two crudely fashioned oval bifaces, three small planoconvex end-scrapers, and five side-scrapers.
The evidence presented by Martin and Potter clearly indicates a Rockport Focus occupation of this chain of islands
at the northern end of the Laguna Madre. Particularly diagnostic are the small, plano-convex end-scrapers, Perdiz and
Fresno arrowpoints, and the bowl of Rockport Black-onGray pottery. An earlier occupation, the Aransas Focus, is
also indicated by the various dart points which can be
identified.
INDIAN ISLAND SITE
The northernmost island in the chain of islands along the
mainland shore has at times lbeen known as Indian Island
(Fig. 1). Tlhis island has an area of less than two acres, a
maximum elevation of a:bout four feet above mean sea level,
and is separated from the mainland by a narrow salt flat
which is covered ·b y water only at times of exceptionally
high tide.

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

This islet was visited in 1929 by A. E. Anderson of Brownsville, Texas, whose notes are on file at the University of
Texas. Anderson states that a midden some 12 to 18 inches
in thickness covered the island at the time of his visit but
that the hurricane of 1919 had done consider·a ble damage to
the deposit. He dug small pits in various places on the island
and passed the excavated material through a screen. A few
artifacts were found in this way. Most of his collection,
however, was obtained from the eroded surface areas. It
consists of 94 stone, bone, and shell ohj ects and 13 potsherds.
Anderson's catalogue makes no distinction between artifacts
excavated and artifacts collected from the surface. This
imposes no real difficulty in interpretation, because the assembl·a ge clearly indicates a Rockport Focus occupation.
Only two specimens suggest an earlier Archaic occupation.

Projectile Points. The flint projectile points, 25 in number, are nearly all arrowpoints. One large, bipointed specimen (Plate 1, F) appears to be a broad form of Lerma dart
point. An additional fragmentary, rechipped specimen,
which has been c1assHied as a knife, may actually be a
form of Desmuke point. The two specimens constitute the
only evidence of an earlier Archaic occupation at the Indian
Island site.
The remaining 24 projectile points are arrowpoints and
occur in forms that consistently appear in the Rockport
Focus as now known. The Perdiz type predominates and is
represented by 12 points (Plate 1, A-B). These Perdiz points
all have the same stem form, but the blade edges vary from
concave (two specimens) through straight (eight) to convex (two). Two additional points (Plate 1, C) are similar
to Perdiz but have narrow stems with parallel edges and
bluntly rounded bases. These may be variants of Perdiz
(their stem bases are lightly damaged), and the same may
be said of two additional points of the same form but with
somewhat broader stems. These last two specimens are
crudely made from very thin, curved flakes and bear flake
scars only here and there along the stem and blade edges.
One speeimen with ·a rudimentary stem is recognizable as

12

a Cliffton point (Plate 1, D). Three points are lozengeshaped in outline, and one of these (Plate 1, E) is unifacially
beveled at both ends, left on the distal portion, right on the
proximal portion. Two triangular points with concave bases
(Plate 1, G) are Fresno points. Plate 1, I, is probably also a
Fresno arrowpoint, but it is thicker, more crudely made, and
asymmetrically triangular. The last point in the series is
broadly lanceloate in form and has a concave base (Plate
1, H).

Knives. The Indian Island collection includes six rather
nondescript sp~cimens which are proba<bly best classified as
small knives (Plate 1, L). They are roughly chipped and in
outline vary from ovate to trianguloid. In length they range
from 43 to 58 mm. and in thickness from 7 to 14 mm. Two
are so crudely fashioned that they may never have been
used.
End-scrapers. Thirty plano-convex end-scrapers made of
flint are included in this collection (Plate 1, M-P). They
are small in size, varying in length from 15 to 46 mm., and
in outline they range from ovate to almost circular. Most of
these tools are actually combination end- and side-scrapers.
Only six are retouched at the end only (Plate 1, M) . Of the
remaining 24 specimens, eight are retouched along one lateral edge (Plate 1, N) and 16 along both lateral edges (Plate
1, 0). Three of the combination scrapers also bear a beaklike graver point on one lateral edge (Plate 1, P). The extremely small end-scraper shown in Plate 1, 0, is the only
one of its kind in the Indian Island series. This tiny form is
common in the Brownsville Focus farther south on the Gulf
coast (MacNeish, 1947, p. 6).
Side-scrapers. Twenty-four side-scrapers (Plate 1, Q-S)
were made from small flint flakes, many of which are long,
narrow, and prismatic in form. In length they range from
22 to 54 mm. Seven of these are retouched along one of the
long sides, producing a more or less straight edge (Plate 1,
Q) ; 12 specimens have two such retouched edges opposite
each other; and four, which were made from broader flakes,

have one broadly convex retouched edge (Plate 1, R). One
side-scraper is unique in that it has a short stem (Plate 1,
S). Most of these side-scrapers show only light retouching.

Drills. The flint drills from this site, five in number, are
distinctive in form. Three are complete and almost identical
in size and shape (Plate 1, J). They are narrow and thick
(thickness is almost as great as width); the proximal ends
are pointed, and two of these three specimens show wear at
the distal end. Their average length is 21 mm. This particular form of drill, which has a tapered proximal end, was
probably set in a handle. A fourth fragmentary specimen
appears to be of the same type. The fifth drill in this series
(Plate 1, K) is broader, is asymmetrical in outline, and has
a narrow, straight base.
Flint Cores. The Indian Island collection contains only
one flint core, but this specimen helps to visualize the
method of obtaining flakes for m aking scrapers and arrowpoints. An elongated river pebble was broken transversely
near one end. The fractured surface of the larger por.tion
was used as a striking platform, and flakes were struck from
the sides of the peb ble, leaving rather long flake scars that
give the core a roughly fluted appearance. This form is
sometimes called a polyhedral core.
Bone and Shell Artifacts. Objects of bone consist of an
undecorated tubular head of bird bone (Plate 1, T) with a
length of 42 mm. and a diameter of 6 mm. (the saw-cut
ends have not been smoothed) ; the distal tip of a wellground spatulate implement of split bone, probably a flaking
tool (Plate 1, U) ; and a sliver of split ·b one having a beveled,
saw-cut facet at one end.
Two small ()bjects of conch shell were collected. One is
roughly disk-shaped (diameter 14 mm.) with a smoothly
ground edge (Plate 1, X); the other is rectanguloid (14 x 16
mm.) with rough edges (Plate 1, Y). These are very common objects in the Brownsville Focus (MacNeish, 1947, p.
6), but rare in known Rockport Focus sites.

16

Texas Archeological Society

Pottery. Fourteen sherds of Rockport ware were collected
by Anderson. Two sherds appear to be from Rockport Plain
bottles. One is a rim sherd from a bottle with narrow, vertical neck and rounded lip; the other is from the neck of a
similar but larger bottle whose exterior surface was heavily
coated with asphaltum. The remaining 12 sherds seem to
come from about six different vessels whose exterior surfaces were brushed, and in eight of these sherds the interior
surface is also brushed. One sherd bears an asphaltumcoated interior, and another has a crack-lacing hole.
Conclusions. This assemblage of artifacts from Indian Island may for the most part be attr1buted to the Rockport
Focus, and this site is the nearest thing to a single-component site that has been reported. Evidence of an earlier
Archaic occupation is very slight. Two artifact forms, the
very small end-scraper and the conch-shell disk, which are
rare at this site and common in sites of the Brownsville
Focus to the south, suggest interaction bet·w een these two
contemporary cultural groups.
WEBB ISLAND SITE
Webb Island, also known as Arrowhead Island, is the
largest of the islands at the northern end of the island chain
(Fig 1). It is separated from the mainland by a channel of
very shallow water some 500 feet in width. Webb Island is
irregular in shape, the main part to the north being roughly
circular, with a smaller lobate extension to the south and
southwest. A small but relatively long inlet almost divides
the northern part of the island from its southern extension.
From north to south Webb Island has a length of approximately 1,250 feet, and its maximum width from east to west
is about 850 feet. The average elevation above mean sea
l'evel is between two and three feet. Grasses and scattered
weeds make up the vegetative cover. The eastern shore is
heavily eroded, and it is clear that wave action, particularly
during hurricanes, has caused steady retreat of this shore
line for a long time.
The island has been visited by a number of individuals

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

17

who have made their collections available for study, and it
has also been tested by excavation. Approximately 5,439
specimens have been collected at the Webb Island site. Of
these, 465 are artifacts of stone, bone, and shell, and 4,974
are potsherds. A chronological account uf the various investigations is presented below.
On January 6, 1929, A. E. Anderson of Bro-wnsville visited Webb Island, collected a few artifacts, and recorded
observations on some ten burials that had recently been
exposed by wave action on the eastern shore. One wellpreserved skull was collected.
In July, 1929, a small surface collection from Webb Island
was donated to the University of Texas by J. C. Webb, landowner. Presumably these specimens were collected over a
period of years preceding that date.
A. M. Wilson o·f the University of Texas visited Webb
Island in the summer of 1930, accompanied by George C.
Martin of Rockport, who directed him to the site. Wilson
collected artifacts, chiefly potsherds, from the eroded beach
and shallow water on the eastern shore of the island. According to Wilson's notes, the Laguna Madre was at that
time rapidly encroaching on the land and removing the
midden deposit capping the island.

Alexander Cox, a resident of Corpus Christi, made collections from the surface at Webb Island at various times
prior to 1933. Part of his collection from the island was
donated to the University of Texas in July, 1933.
Test excavations (described below) at Webb Island were
made by A. 'T. Jackson and a crew of several men during a
three-day period (July 16-18) in the summer of 1933. Most
of the artifacts described below were derived from this investigation by the University of Texas.
At various times during the past 15 years William E.
St·a nton of Corpus Christi has collected from the -surface at
Webb Island. His collection was recently made available for

18

Texas Archeological Society

study, and all of his potsherds from Webb Island were donated to the University of Texas.
In his excavations of 1933, Jackson dug four test trenches
on the eastern shore of Webb Island. Three of these were
dug at intervals of about 75 feet on the larger northern part
of the island, and the fourth was dug across the narrow
isthmus which joins the two main parts of the island. The
width of these test tren~hes is unspecified, but a sketch map
in the field notes indicates that they had approximate
lengths of 100, 150, 90, and 60 feet. The three trenches on
the northern part of the island began at the eastern beach
line and proceeded in a westerly direction toward the interior of the island.
The field records do not refer to any method of excavation
control, and depth records do not seem to have been made
for any artifacts. However, the statement is made that all
of the artifacts encountered during excavation were in the
upper 15 inches of midden deposit. It is also stated that
nearly all of the pottery and flint artifacts occurred in the
topmost eight inches of the midden, but a few potsherds
were found as deep as 14 inches below the surface. AI though
two cultural horizons are present at Webb Island, it is not
possible to separate them on the basis of clear stratigraphic
evidence. Except for pottery, nothing can be attributed to
any particular level in the midden. The artifacts derived
from this excavation must perforce be assigned the same
status as those taken from the surface by the various collectors.
The midden deposit seems to have covered most of the
northern part of the island, and in Jackson's excavations it
ranged in thickness from 18 inches to 33 inches. It was made
up principally of discarded marine shells and animal bones
in a loose matrix of dark, sandy soil. Field ident1fications
indicate that the shells included oyster, clam, and conch,
and that bones included fish, bird, and deer, as wen as a
few bison and human bones. Most of the animal bones were
fragmented and showed traces of having been in fire. Beds
of charcoal were noted at several places in the excavations,

and one such area was identified as a "fire pit". Bits of
burned clay, fragments of pumice, and lumps of asphaltum
occurred here and there in the midden deposit. The artifacts scattered through the upper part of the midden-it is
puzzling that no artifacts were ,f ound in the lower partconsisted of objects made from stone, bone, shell, and clay
(pottery). Also ine'luded were flint chips and cores, which
indicate local flint chipping. No European objects were encountered during excavation, but coins and pieces of rusted
iron were collected from the surface.
When Anderson visited Webb Island in 1929, some ten
burials were in various stages of exposure by wave action
in one section of the eastern beach. Groups of human bones
were distributed over a beach zone some 150 feet wide. This
zone extended from a low, wave-cut bluff out into shallow
water. Some burials were exposed in situ; others were entirely uncovered and the bones were being scattered by the
waves. One skuiJ.l was observed in situ under six inches of
water. Anderson's notes provide no data on position and
orientation of the skeletons. Among the bones of one burial
a deer metapodial awl was found (Plate 4, C); and from the
burial area one conch shell adze was also collected. These
occurrences suggest that some of the burials belong to the
Aransas occupation. Anderson estimates that the skeletons
were probably buried at a depth of some three feet at a time
when the island was at least 200 feet wider that it was in
1929.
In the following sections the artifacts from Webb Island
will be described by classes, as dart points, knives, drills,
etc. For each class described, certain types and forms will
be identified as probably associated with either the Aransas
or the Rockport Focus. The b'asis for such judgments is the
reported presence of these types and forms in other components of these foci on the Gu'lf coast.

Dart Points. Fifty-two dart points occur in the Webb
Island series, of which nine are unclassifiable fragments.
Twelve types have been recognized among the remaining

22

Texas Archeological Society

43 specimens, and these types are listed below in order of
frequency.
(1) Catan (Plate 2, E-F), nine specimens (21 % ) . Four
of these are unifacially beveled on the left.
(2) Matamoros (Plate 2, J), eight specimens (19 %). One
is unHacially beveiled on the left.
(3) Tortugas (Plate 2, H-I), seven specimens (16 %). Two
are unifacially ·b eveled on the left.
(4) Kent (Plate 2, L), four specimens (9 % ).
(5) Abasolo (Plate 2, B-D), three specimens (7 % ). The
point at Plate 2 (Plate 2, B) has been damaged at the base,
which is the reason for its fluted appearance.
(6) Darl (Plate 2, R), two specimens (5 %). One of these
has a unifacial'ly beveled stem (left) and a unifacially beveled blade (right); the other has only a unifacially beveled
stem (right).
(7) Refugio (Plate 2, A), two specimens (5 % ).
(8) Ensor (Plate 2, Q), one specimen (2 % ).
(9) Castroville (Plate 2, 0), one specimen (2 %).
(10) Desmuke (Plate 2, K), one specimen (2%).

(11) Morhiss (Plate 2, M), one specimen (2%).
(12) Palmillas (Plate 2, N), one specimen (2 % ).
(13) Unidentified (Plate 2, G, P), three specimens (7 % ) .
The specimen not illustrated (a basal fragment) is similar
to Plate 2, P, but has a straight base.
In order to facilitate comparison, the dart points from two
excavated and previously .published Archaic sites (Aransas
Focus) on the Texas coast have been re-examined and the
types identified with the assistance of Dee Ann Suhm. These
are the Johnson site (Campbell, 1947) and the Kent-Crane
site (Campbell, 1952), both of which are located about 40
airline miles north of Webb Island.

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

23

Among the nine dart points from the Johnson site seven
types can be identified: Catan, 2; Matamoros, 1; Ensor, 1;
Edgewood, 1; Ellis, 1; Kent, 1; Lange, 1; unidentified, 1.
At the Kent-Crane site, with 101 dart points, 20 types can
be identified: Kent, 19; Ensor, 14; Tortugas, 12; Lange, 10;
Marcos, 6; Matamoros, 5; Travis, 5; PalmiLlas, 5; Ellis, 4;
Abasolo, 3; Catan, 1; Pedernales, 1; Uvalde, 1; Martindale, 1;
Edgewood, 1; Desmuke, 1; Bulverde, 1; Kinney, 1; Nolan, 1;
Marshall, 1; unidentified, 8. As the total number is 101, the
above frequences serve as approximate percentages.
To those unaccustomed to a muHiplicity of projectile point
types in the same component, the recognition of 20 different
types at the Kent-Crane site may seem unbelievably large.
It may be pointed out, however, that the Archaic cultures of
central and southern Texas are marked by an amazingly
large number of dart point types (Suhm et al., 1954, p. 100) .
An adequate explanation for this phenomenon has not yet
been found .
When the dart points from Webb Island are compared
with those from the Kent~Crane site, a number of signi.f icant
facts emerge. Most o,f the types that occur at Webb Island
also occur at Kent-Crane. The exceptions are low-frequency
types (Morhiss, Refugio, Castroville, and Darl do not occur
at Kent-Crane). Fewer types characteristic of the Edwards
Plateau Aspect occur at Weblb Island. Types characteristic
of the Fa'lc6n and Mier foci of southern Texas and adjoining
northeastern Mexico occur in both sites (Tortugas, Abasolo,
Matamoros, and Catan), but the frequency of each type is
considembly higher at Webb Island. This suggests that as
one moves southward from the central section of the Texas
coast, Falcon and Mier dart point types will increase in frequency and Edwards Plateau types will decline.
Of the 12 dart point types represented at Webb Island,
all except Catan, Matamoros, Darl, and Ensor may safely be
attributed to an Aransas occupation. The status of the four
exceptions is uncertain because they are types which appear
to have survived from the the Archaic into the N eo-Ameri-

can stage in central and southern Tex·a s (Suhm, et al., 1954,
pp. 410, 414, 422, 448).
Arrowpoints. All of the 'a rrow.points at Webb Island are
attrilbuted to the Rockport Focus. The series consists of
242 flint arrowpoints, of which 13 are unclassifiable fragments. Of the 229 classifiable points, 206 have been identified as follows:

(1) Perdiz (Plate 3, A-P), 148 specimens (65%). As this
is a fairly large sample from a single site, it provides an
opportunity to study local variation in the Perdiz type. Of 82
points wHh stems undamaged, about 36% have stems that
are bluntly rounded as opposed to sharply pointed. In a
number of these points (13 % ) the stem has approximately
parallel edges for a large part of its 'length before tapering
to a point (Plate 3, C, H, I). About 10% of this group have
short, broad stems in com:b inati:on with square or sloping
shoulders (Plate 3, N-P), and some of these, although smaller
in size, grade into the Cliffton type (cf. Plate 3, Q-S). Suhm
(personal communication) points out that a few of these
(Plate 3, J, P) resemble the Bassett type of northeastern
Texas (Fulton Aspect). Approximately 30% of these Perdiz
points have long, narrow stems (Plate 3, A, E, L, M), and
about 47% have stems that are relatively short and narrow
(Plate 3, B, G, J). In the whole series of Perdiz points (148
specimens) blade edges tend to be perfectly straight (37%)
or concave (37%); less commonly convex (26%). In specimens with convex blade edges the amount of convexity is
not great. A majority of the Perdiz points are barbed (77%);
some have square shoulders (17%); and a few have poorly
defined shoulders (6 % ). Serrated blade edges occur in
about 6% of the Perdiz points at this site.
(2) Fresno (Plate 3, HH-JJ), 29 specimens (13%). Of
the 29, 11 have bases that are s·t raight or almost straight and
18 have concave bases; five have serrated lateral edges. One
additional arrowpoint, possibly of Fresno type, was rechipped at the distal end to form a short-pointed drill (Plate
3, RR).

(3) Starr (Plate 3, EE-GG), 16 specimens (7%). All of
these Starr points have concave bases and concave lateral
edges, but in some specimens the basal concavity is rather
shallow. The dividing line between Starr and Fresno points
in the Webb Island series has to 'be drawn al'lbitrarily, for
the two types grade into each other. Starr points are common in the Brownsville and Mier Foci of extreme southern
Texas and northeastern Mexico (Suhm, et al., 1954, pp. 132,
141), and their presence at Webb Island in a Rockport component is of special interest.
(4) Cliffton (Plate 3, Q-S), 6 specimens (3 % ) . As Cliffton
points elsewhere are consistently associated with Perdiz
points, it is possible that Cliffton is only an extreme variant
of Perdiz.

(5) Young (Plate 3, LL), 5 specimens (2 %). These have
been chipped from thin flakes, and in each specimen only
one face is covered ·b y flake scars, the other face being marginally retouched. Four of these points have convex bases;
the fifth has a base that is almost straight. Young points
are associated with the Henrietta Focus of north-central
Texas and adjoining part of southern Oklahoma, and they
are said to be rare in central Texas (Suhm et al., 1954, p.
510). Their presence at Webb Island extends the distribution of the Young point to the Gulf coast.
(6) Scallorn (Plate 3, X-Y), 2 specimens (1 %) .
Arrowpoints of unidentified type at Webb Island number
23 (about 10%) . The principal forms are described below.
Eleven arrowpoints have slightly expanding stems with
convex bases, concave to straight blade edges, and strong
ba11bs (Plate 3, Z-DD). Two of these are very small (Plate
3, DD). These points do not appear to be variants of the
Scallorn type, which is represented by only two readily
identifiaJble specimens at this site. They show considerable
variation, especially in size and in stem width.
Seven arrowpoints are neatly lozenge-shaped in outline
(Plate 3, T, U), and it is difficult in some instances to de-

28

Texas Archeological Society

termine which is the proximal end. These are made from
thin flakes and are marginally retouched on both faces. It
is possible that they are extreme variants of Perdiz (cf.
Pl·a te 3, N, with T, U).
Two arrowpoints are lanceolate in outline; one has a concave base (Plate 3, V), the other has a convex base (Plate
3, W).
Two arrowpoints are trianguloid but have strongly convex bases (Plate 3, MM). They resemble Young points in
outline and method of manufacture, but they are much
smaller in size (the smallest is only 16 mm. long). These
may be variants of the Fresno type.
One point, unique in the Webb Island series, is lanceolate
in outline and has recurved lateral edges (Plate 3, KK). It
bears some resemblance to the Talco type of northeastern
Texas (Titus Focus), but it does not appear to fall within
the Talco range of variation (see Suhm et al., 1954, p. 508).
The arrowpoint (as opposed .to the dart point) has consistently :been recognized as diagnostic of the Rockport Focus, but very few .arrowpoints from the central section of
the 'T exas coast have been described and illustrated in the
literature. The arrowpoints from Indian Island and Webb
Island, although not stratigraphically isolated by excavation,
are important because they provide a measure of typological
range in the Rockport Focus. The types present at these
two sites will, of course, have to be validated by controlled
excavation.

Knives. Only two flint knives occur in the Webb Island
collections. They are large, relatively thin, and almost circular in outline (Plate 4, G). The Abasolo and Refugio dart
points described above (see Plate 2, A-D) may also have
served as knives. At present it is not poss1ble to assign
these knives to a particular component at Wehb Island.
End-scrapers. One of the most common and characteristic
tools at Webb Island is a very small plano-convex endscraper made of flint (Plate 2, U-Z). Fifty-nine of these

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

29

were collected and nearly all of them are less than 40 mm.
in length. Some are actually of thumb-nail size. These endscrapers are all very much alike, being fashioned from fairly
thick flakes and having a steeply retouched convex scraping
edge at one end. Occasionally one or both lateral edges are
also retouched to form a combination side- and end-scraper.
There are minor variations, however, and some of these
may be noted. The extremely small end-scrapers, six in
number, have a breadth equal to or somewhat greater than
the length (Plate 2, U). Two end-scrapers are very long
and narrow, and one of these has both lateral edges retouched. Thirty are ovoid in outline (Plate 2, V), though
the steeply retouched end may sometimes broaden out to
give the specimen an outline that is more pyriform than
ovoid (Plate 2, Y). A few of these ovoid scrapers bear a retouched lateral concavity (Plate 2, W). Nineteen may be referred to as truncated ovoid (Plate 2, X) . Two specimens
have a broadly elliptical outline; these are made from thicker flakes and the whole circumference is steeply retouched
(Plate 2, Z).
The similarity of the end-scrapers at Webb Island to those
at Indian Island would indicate that most of the end-scrapers
at Webb Island are referable to the Rocroport Focus. Reference has already been made to the common occurrence of
the extremely small end-scrapers in the Brownsville Focus.
Side-scrapers. The 29 flint side-scrapers (Plate 2, AACC) are also rather small. Twenty-two of these are prismatic flakes with one or both lateral edges neatly retouched.
The retouched edges are usually quite straight, but occasionally they may be slightly concave or slightly convex (Plate
2, AA-BB). The average length of these prismatic forms is
20 mm. Two side-scrapers are conchoidal in outline and
have one strongly convex scraping edge (Plate 2, CC). The
remaining five specimens are concave scrapers made from
larger and thicker flakes. It is likely that most of the sidescrapers belong to the Rockport occupation at Webb Island.
In general they duplicate the series at Indian Island.

30

Texas Archeological Society

Gravers. Four rather thick flint flakes bear graver points
(Plate 2, S), short 'b eak-like projections showing minute retouching on both edges near the point. None of these has
flake scars on the buLbar or flat face of the flake. Flint
gravers are known to occur in the Aransas Focus (Campibell,
1952, p. 71), and for this reason the Webb Island gravers are
attri:buted to the Aransas component. It may turn out that
gravers also occur in the Rockport Focus.
Drills. Flint drills number 12 specimens and most of these
are slender bipointed forms. Four are rod-like in form, with
edges parallel for most of the length, and they are carefully
chipped on both faces to produce a thickly lenticular crosssection (Plate 3, NN-00). Six are similar, but the proximal
end tapers below what may be called poorly defined shoulders, giving the effect of a pointed stem (Plate 3, PP), like
those at Indian Island. These could have served as arrowpoints, for they grade into the Perdiz arrowpoint series.
Slender, 'b ipointed drills also occur in the Brownsville F·o cus
(MacNeish, 1947, p. 6). Another form of drill, represented
by oniy one specimen (Plate 3, QQ) was made by shaping
one end of a long, narrow flake to a tapered point; the
opposite or proximal end is bulbous and shows only a small
amount of retouching. One triangular arrowpoint, possilbly
of Fresno type, had been rechipped to form a short-pointed
drill (Plate 3, RR). All of these drills are attributed to the
Rockport Focus.
Gouge. One very small plano-convex gouge (or endscraper) of flint was collected at Webb Island (Plate 2, T).
This specimen is 33 mm. long and 24 mm. wide, and the
steeply retouched cutting edge is battered and dulled from
use. Except for its very small size, this tool is indistinguishable from the larger Clear Fork gouge that occurs widely in
Archaic cultures of the Texas area. Sayles (1935, Table 5)
attrilbutes the small form to his Rockpol't Phase on the Texas
coast. The survival of this form later than the Archaic stage
on the coast needs to be confirmed by excavation.
Miscellaneous Flint Artifacts. Two small flakes, each bearing a neatly serrated edge, were also collected at Webb

Island (Plate 2, DD), as well as a large number of flint
flakes of assorted sizes that may have 1been used but bear
no traces of retouching or use. These materials cannot be
assigned to any particular occupation at the site.

Milling Stones. Milling stones seem to have been rare at
Webb Island. The collections include one hand stone (mano)
and one fragment of a grinding slab, both made of sandstone.
The hand stone has 'been shaped by pecking; it is broadly
oval in outline and has one strongly convex grinding facet
(Plate 4, E). The grinding-slab fragment shows wear on
both flat surfaces. Milling stones have not yet been linked
with the Rockport Focus, but they do occur in the Aransas
Focus (Campbell, 1947, pp. 59-60).
Hammerstones. A lenticular core of mottled gray flint
(69 x 81 x 28 mm.) was used as a hammerstone, for its circumference is heavily battered in places. A rectanguloid
quartzite pebble also shows battering along all its edges.
These could have occurred in either occupation at Webb
Island.
Abrading Stones. Five small, thin fragments of sandstone
show flat or slightly concave grinding facets on both surfaces. Fragments 9f pumice, which frequently wash ashore
on the Texas coast, appear to have been collected by the
aboriginal inhabitants and used for purposes of abrasion.
Six such pumice fragments, all roughly oval in outline, were
found on Weblb Island, three of them in Jackson's excavations. The largest has a length of 97 mm., but only one of
these six fragments exhibits any evidence of usage-a flat
facet developed by abrasion. Sandstone abraders have been
reported from Aransas sites (Campbell, 1952, p. 72), but
sandstone and pumice abraders have yet to be linked with
the Rockport Focus.
Asphaltum. Lumps of asphaltum were encountered by
Jackson in the upper 12 inches of the midden deposit. Eight
were collected and brought to the laboratory. One small
piece bears a faint basketry impression on one flat surface.
Wilson also collected one small piece of asp hal tum showing

34

Texas Archeological Society

what appears to be a twined basketry impression. Thus far
asphaltum showing twined basketry impressions has been
reported only in Aransas Focus sites (Campbell, 1952, pp.
73-74). Asphal<tum was, however, extensively used for decorating and surface-coating Rockport pottery.

Shell Artifacts. Artifacts of shell are rare in the Webb
Island collections. The shells used were chiefly conch and
clam. The series includes 16 beach-rolled columellae of small
conch shells varying in length from 35 to 72 mm. Six of
these were found in the test trenches, and it is likely that
the occupants of Webb Island collected these small objects
for use as awls and even possibly as skewers for meat.
Eighteen shell objects exhibit unmistakable evidences of
human handiwork. These include seven adzes made from
conch whorl (one was found by Anderson in the burial
area), both triangular and quadrangular forms being represented in approximately equal numbers (Plate 4, A-B) ; a
conch columella gouge (Plate 4, D) ; a small end-scraper
made of clam shell (Plate 4, H); four small triangular objects ·o f thin clam shell, all approximately of the same size,
which may be awls or possibly projectile points (Plate 4,
I; this specimen differs from the others in having a beveled
base); a disk-shaped bead of conch shell (diameter 10 mm.,
thickness 5.5 mm.), with a conical perforation; a rather
large triangular piece of conch shell (Plate 4, F) ; and two
small quadrangular pieces of conch whorl. Of these various
shell objects, only one, the clam-shell end-scraper came from
the test excavation. A tiny gastropod shell (Cerithium variabile) :bears a small perforation at its anterior end, apparently by punching through the thin shell with a sharppointed tool.
Only three of these shell artifact forms can be assigned
to a specific component. Conch-shell adzes and gouges are
common in Aransas Focus sites (Campbell, 1947, p. 65), but
it has not yet been established that these forms survived
into Rockport times. Disk beads of shell occur in the
Brownsville Focus (MacNeish, 1947, p. 6), and for this
reason the single specimen from Webb Island is attributed

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

35

to the Rockport Focus, which is considered to be contemporaneous.

Bone Artifacts. A deer metapodial awl (Plate 4, C) was
found by Anderson in the burial area on the eastern beach.
This was among the scattered bones of one of the burials
that was being exposed by wave action. Only one other
bone artifact appears in the Webb Island collections, a fragment of a tubular bone bead. One end of this bead is ground
to a smoothly rounded edge, but the opposite end is jaggedly broken. The bead was made from a light bone having
a diameter of appro:x2imately 6 mm. The length of the fragment is 29 mm. An eroded antler tip and two garfish scales
were also collected. The latter may have served as projectile points, but this is doubtful. In the literature metapodi!al awls and bone beads have thus far been linked with
the Aransas Focus (Campbell, 1952, pp. 55, 60), but the
presence of a bone bead at Indian Island suggests that this
artifact form also occurs in the Rockport Focus.
Pottery. Some 4,974 potsherds were collected at Webb
Island. Many of these are very small fragments (exceptioll!ally small fragments were not counted), and a ronsiderable number are badly eroded by wave action, making
observations of surface treatment impossible. The identifications given below are reasonably accurate, for they are
based only on sherds with observable criteria. The category
labeled ''Rockport ware" is a residue category that includes
all sherds believed to fall within the range of the Rockport
series of types.
The types designated Rockport Plain, Rockport Black-onGray, and Rockport Incised have been described in the
Handbook (Suhm, et al., 1954, pp. 382-385). As no large
sample of Roc~ort Focus pottery from a single site has
previously been described, the following paragraphs will
summarize the characteristics of each type as shown by the
pottery from Webb Island. Only criteria of form and decoration will be considered, because paste criteria are adequately covered by the Handbook.

36

Texas Archeological Society

(1) Rockport Plain. Sixty-four rim sherds from what appear to be bowls and jars have been classified as Rockport
Plain.
The bowls, represented by 26 rim sherds, all seem to be
hemispherical in form. Nineteen of these have flat lips
(Plate 5, DD-EE), including three that have a slight external overhang (GG) and three that have diagonally incised lips, giving the flat lip a milled effect. Seven sherds
have rounded lips (Plate 5, FF). Some ibowls at Webb Island
had scored surfaces: one rim sherd has a horizontally scored
interior; two are similarly scored on both interior and exterior surfaces; and one is horizontally scored on the interior,
but scored on the exterior in a crisscross fashion. One bowl
sherd bears a crack-lacing hole.
Jars, which are represented by 38 rim sherds, appear to
have had two basic forms, one with an incurved rim (16
sherds), the other with an essentially vertical rim (22
sherds). Jars with inqurved rims have flat lips (Plate 5,
Y-AA); in this group three rim sherds show a slight internal
lip overhang (Plate 5, Z) and three show an external overhang (Plate 5, AA). Jars with vertical rims have either fiat
lips (6 cases; Plate 5, BB) or rounded lips (16 cases; Plate
5, CC). Surface scoring and exterior asphaltum-coating occur on jars. Only two sherds have a horizontally scored
interior (on one of these the exterior is asphaltum-coated).
Seven sherds have both interior and exterior surfaces scored,
all horizontally except f.or the interiors of three sherds,
which have a combination of horizontal and diagonal scoring 't hat gives the effect of a pattern. Six jar sherds have
asphaltum-coated exteriors; and one sherd is asphalt-coated
on both surfaces.
(2) Rockport Black-on-Gray. Sherds assigned to this type
total 132, of which 20 are rim sherds.
Among the 20 rim sherds, six appear to be from jars with
fairly straight rims, two with flat lips (Plate 5, T) and four
with rounded lips (P:l ate 5, U-V). Three of the six jar-rim
sherds have painted lips and the remainder have faint traces

of a single vertical wavy line on the exterior. One rim sherd
with painted lip has a horizontally scored interior.
The remaining 14 rim sherds appear to be from hemispherical bowls: eight with flat lips (Plate 5, B, C, W), one
flat lip with interior overhang (Plate 5, F), and five with
rounded lips (Plate 5, D, X). Two of the flat-lipped bowl
sherds have rather deeply notched lips (Plate 5, B). In each
case the flat lip has been painted with asphaltum, but the
painting does not extend into the notches. Lip painting also
occurs on nine additional bowl rim sherds (Plate 5, C-D).
Three sherds have a more complicated exterior design in
black paint: one horizontal band at the rim, extending over
the lip, and a fairly broad diagonal line or band located below but not connected (Plate 5, F). Asphaltum coating occurs on a few of the bowl rim sherds. Two sherds have
coated interiors, and two additional sherds have exterior
coating below, and separated from, the painted lip (Plate
5, D).
The Rockport Black-on-Gray body sherds cannot be identified as to form, although one specimen appears to be from
a narrow-necked bottle. These 112 sherds all bear traces of
a design in black on the exterior, the most common element
(82 cases) being a vertical line that varies from straight to
wavy (Plate 5, G-K). About half of these vertical lines are
straight or very slightly sinuous, the remainder being very
sinuous. One sherd shows a sinuous line extending from a
horizontal band (Plate 5, L). It is evident that a very common form of decoration on Rockport Black-on-Gray vessels
was a series of widely spaced vertical lines that extended
downward from the vessel rim, as shown by Potter (1930,
Plate 8). Diagonal lines occur only on three sherds (Plate
5, N). Dots, either in vertical rows (Plate 5, P) or scattered,
are also rather rare, occurring on only eight sherds (cf. Potter, 1930, Plate 8, Fig. 16). An additional 18 sherds bear parts
of what appear to be bolder designs (Plate 5, M, 0). Only
12 of the 112 Rockport Black-on-Gray body sherds have
scored surfaces (seven with scored interior, one with scored
exterior, and four with both surfaces scored). Only one

40

Texas Archeological Society

sherd shows exterior scoring in combinaUon with painted
decoration (Plate 5, N). An interior coating of asphaltum,
however, is very common (74 sherds). Occasionally a sherd
in this series will have faint traces of red pigment adhering
to the exterior surface, but it is very fugitive and very difficult to determine whether it is from a red wash or slip.
(3) Rockport Incised. Only one sherd of this type can be
identified in the Webb Island series (undecorated body
sherds of this type cannot be distinguished from similar
sherds of other Rockport pottery types). This single sherd
(Plate 5, A) appears to be rrom a jar with vertical rim and
rounded Jip. A cross-hatched band appears just below the
lip; one set of lines is horizontal, the other diagonal.
(4) Rockport ware body sherds. A total of 4,775 body
sherds appear to belong to the Rockport series of pottery
ty,p es but cannot be identified as Rockport Plain, Rockport
Black-on-Gray, or Rockport Incised. Of these, 3,750 are plain,
having no surface scoring or asphaltum coating; but one
sherd in this series does have a vertical row of very small
punctates ('Plate 5, E). Another sherd in this group consists of a handle fragment, round in cross-section, that is
heavily tempered with bone. In form of handle and tempering this resembles handles on Rockport pottery from the
historic Aranama Mission site in Goliad County as well as
handles on Leon Plain from the Central Texas Aspect
(Suhm et al., 1954, Plate 74, C-D). Three ibase sherds in
this plain group indicate vessels with somewhat conically
rounded bases. An additional 592 sherds are plain but are
asphaltum-coated on one or both surfaces. Scoring of one
or both surfaces, without asphaltum-coating, occurs on another group of 288 sherds, and still another group of 145
sherds exhibit a combination of scoring and asphaltum-coating. On scored sherds the scoring of the interior surface
(Plate 5, Q-S) is usually much deeper than on the exterior.
Larger twigs were used to score interior surfaces, and the
interior scored lines tend to be horizontally parallel, whereas
on the exterior they are irregularly spaced and the lines frequently cross each other. Crack-lacing holes occur in six

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

41

sherds of this Rockport ware body sherd series, and one
sherd has been made into a disk (diameter 20 mm., thickness 4mm.)
(5) Intrusive sherds. Very few sherds at Webb Island can
be regarded as intrusive. One sherd of light brown pottery
is heavily tempered with large white particles (material unidentified), some of which have fallen away from the surface, leaving it heavily pitted. This may be from a vessel
of Leon Plain (cf. Suhm et al., 1954, Plate 74, F) , which is
associated with the Central Texas Aspect.
A second intrusive sherd is somewhat startling. It is a
very small sherd that has been identified as Carretas Polychrome from Chihuahua, Mexico (Stanley Stubbs, letter,
Dec. 6, 1950). Carretas Polychrome is dated as circa A. D.
1300-1400. This is the only Southwestern sherd that has
been reported from the Texas coast. The date falls well
within the estimated time range of the Rockport Focus
(circa A. D. 1000-1800).

European Objects. These include a portion of a large
metal knife blade, three unidentifiable pieces of rusted
metal, and three coins. All of these came from the surface
of the site.
The coins were found among the archeological materials
exposed by w ave action on the eastern shore of Webb Island.
The first of these, and the best preserved, was found by
Alexander Cox during one of his visits to the island sometime prior to 1933; the second was found by Henry Fulton
of Corpus Christi on July 2, 1933, witnessed by J. E . Pearce
and A. T. Jackson; and the third, a poorly preserved specimen, was found by A. T. Jackson two weeks la,ter, when the
site was being excavaJted by the University of Texas. These
three coins are very much alike; they have approximately
the same size, are irregularly round in outline, and bear an
equal-armed cross in relief on one face. A photograph of the
coins found by Cox and Jackson was sent to the United
States National Museum in February, 1934, and w as examined by Theodore T. Belote, Curator of History. Belote re-

42

Texas Archeological Society

ported ,t hat the coin found by Cox-the better preserved of
the two-was a Spanish coin of uncertain date but probably
struck about 1700.
It is of course impossible to prove that these coins were
ever in the hands of the aboriginal occupants of Webb Island. There is acceptable evidence of European contact in a
number of collections from Rockport Focus sites, such as
Perdiz and Fresno arrowpoints chipped from bottle glass. It
is also of interest to note that Jackson cites (in his Webb
Island field report) unconfirmed reports of coins perforated
for suspension having been found at sites in this section of
the Texas coast. Shipwrecks on Padre Island, or any of the
other offshore barrier islands, would have been a convenient
source for these coins.

Conclusions. An analysis of the archeological materials
from Webb Island indicates that Aransas and Rockiport components are both present at this site. Unfortunately the brief
excavations at Webb Island failed to produce clear evidence
of their stratigraphic relationship. This can be inferred,
however, from evidence obtained at better documented si.tes
in this section of the coast. Both cultural groups seem to
have occupied the island because of its food p01tential-fish,
shellfish, and aquatic birds. The presence of large mammal
bones, such as deer and bison, indicate that hunting was
done on the nearby mainland.
The identification of Aransas Focus materials from Webb
Island was done on the basis of comparison with artifacts
from excavated Aransas components farther north on the
coast. The recognition of an Aransas component at Webb
Island extends the documented range of this culture some
40 to 50 miles farther southward along the coast. As dart
points characteristic of the Falcon and Mier Focus show a
higher frequency at Webb Island than at Aransas sites to
the north, it seems likely that the coastal strip south of
Corpus Christi represents a zone of transition from one
focus of Archaic culture to another.
The identification of Rockport Focus materials from Webb

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

43

Island was based on comparison with artifacts from a few
excavated Rockport components and with the surface collection from nearby Indian Island, a site which appears to
yield only Rockport artifacts. Cross-checking with published trait lists for the Rockport focus was also a part of
the procedure. The chief value of the Rockport materials
from Webb Island is that they constitute a relatively large
sample of Rockport artifacts and thus give a much clearer
impression of the content of this culture. Traits shared with
the Central Texas Aspect and with the Brownsville Focus
can be made more specific, and there is a tantalizing hint
of wider contacts in the intrusive polychrome sherd from
Chihuahua.
SITES 77B5-2, 77B8-6, AND 77B8-7
On three islands south of Webb Island (Fig 1) middens
are known to exist, but very little descriptive dart;a are available. As these islands are in the same chain as Indian Island
and Webb Island, it may be surmised that they have similar
topographic and archeological features. The three islands
were visited in 1929 by A. E. Anderson and in 1930 by A. M.
Wilson. Both men collected archeological specimens from
each island, but in their records they failed to indicate which
specimens came from which island. The two collections,
which will here be described as a unit, indicate that an
Aransas Focus occupation was followed by a Rockport Focus
occupation.
Among the artifacts attributable to the Aransas occupation is a knife or scraper (Plate 1, DD) made by chipping
the margin of a valve of the sunset clam (MacrocalLista nimbosa), an artifact type which occurred in the Aransas component at the Kent-Crane site (Campbell, 19'52, p. 54). Also
attributed to the Aransas focus are four dart poinrts (Plate 1,
Z-CC), three of which (Z-BB) can be duplicated at the
Kent-Crane site. None of these dart points is readily identifiable as to type although one (Z) may fall within the range
of the Lange point. The point AA bears a thick, white
patina. The point CC looks like a rechipped Plainview point,
but it lacks grinding on the lateral edges and base.

Rockport Focus artifacts include one small, bipointed drill
(Plate 1, V), similar to those found at Webb Island; a triangular arrowpoint with deeply serrated ~ateral edges (Plate
1, W), apparently a rare form in Rockport sites; and 263
potsherds. The sherds are mostly small and are badly eroded
by wave action, but they all appear to be from vessels of
Rockport ware. Of the 263 sherds, 238 bear no traces of
brush- marking or decorative painting with asphaHum
(many sherds are so water-worn that both exterior and
interior surfaces have 'b een removed completely). Five
sherds do show brushed or scored surfaces, and 20 sherds
have surfaces heavily coated with asphaitum.
SUMMARY AND GENERAL CONCLUSIONS
Archeological materials collected from five sites on a
chain of small islands in the Laguna Madre of the Texas
coast have been analyzed, described, and evaluated. Most
of the artifacts were collected from the surface, but on two
islands some of the artifacts were derived from limited excavation without adequate control. The assemblage from
each site (or group of sites) has been treated as a surface
collection, and an attempt has been made to reconstruct the
components represented. This "salvage" operation has limited value, but it is justifiable in a poorly known area that
is not likely to be the scene of extensive excavation within
the immediate future.
Of the four cultural stages stages now recognized in Texas,
Paleo-American, Archaic, N eo-American, and Historic, only
the first is not represented by recognizable specimens in the
collections from these islands. The Archaic Stage is well
represented by a considerable number of artifacts assignable
to the Aransas Focus, and the N eo-American Stage is even
better represented by a large number of artifacts assignable
to the Rockport Focus. Very little can be attributed to the
Historic Stage.
The Aransas components identified on these islands are
located on the extreme southern limit of the Aransas Focus
as now known. In dart-point styles the Aransas components,

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

45

particularly that at Webb Island, show more orientation toward the Falcon and Mier Foci to the south than toward the
Edwards Plateau Aspect to the north and northwest. The
reverse is true of Aransas components located farther north
on the coast.
The Rockport components on the islands add much detail
to the Rockport Focus trait list. The large sample involved
makes it possible to be more specific about traits shared
with the Brownsville Focus to the south (Starr and Fresno
points, tiny end-scrapers, bipointed flint drills, shell disks,
and shell disk beads) and with the Central Texas Aspect of
interior Texas (Perdiz, Cliffton, ScaHorn, Fresno, and Young
arrowpoints). The large sample of Rockport pottery adds
specific detail to knowledge of the types previously described. The rarity of Rockport Incised pottery on these
islands suggests that we are near the southwestern periphery
of a decorative technique that is probably derived from the
incised pottery of the Galveston Bay Focus. Little light is
shed on the problem of the origin of painted pottery on the
Texas coast, but the intrusive sherd of polychrome pottery
from Chihuahua suggests diffusion from an area other than
the eastern coast of Mexico, its most likely source.
In the absence of stratigraphic data, it is impossible to
estimate in years the probable time range of human occupation of these islands in the Laguna Madre. As the Aransas
Focus as a whole contains a number of dar,t point styles that
are believed to be late in the Edwards Plateau Aspect (Ensor
and Darl) and in the Falc6n-Mier sequence (Matamoros and
Catan), it may be that the Aransas Focus as now known occupies only the latter part of the Archaic Stage. The Rockport occupation at these islands shows little evidence of
European contact, but it is likely that the islands were occupied at intervals well into historic time, which on the Texas
coast begins shortly after A. D. 1500.

FOOD HABITS OF THE TEXAS COASTAL
INDIANS IN THE EARLY SIXTEENTH
CENTURY 1
ALEX

D.

KRIEGER

It has always been very difficult to obtain detailed information on the foods eaten by American Indians while in
their purely native condition; that is, uninfluenced by European civilization. The archeologist may often obtain bones,
shells, and charred vegetal matter, and through laborious
identifications, obtain some insight into what forms of life
were hunted and gathered. Even under the most ideal conditions, however, the human factor is missing and we can
hardly know anything about how the countryside was exploited during the various seasons, or how far the natives
may have traveled to obtain any particular kind of food.

The journals and accounts of early explorers seldom go
beyond the generalities that the natives did or did not practice agriculture, or merely that they did hunt, fish, or collect
wild foods. This tells us little about the food-gathering techniques, the density of population that could be sustained by
the techniques known, the size of the communities, or the
ways in which man himself may have changed the natural
environment :by selecting some foods, thus altering the natural competition between species.
This brief study summarizes certain valuable data left us
by the first Europeans who are known to have lived along
the Gulf shores of Texas. This was during the period 1528
to 1534, only 36 years after the first voyage of Columbus to
the New World. The Texas coast was roughly mapped by a
Spanish navigator, Pineda, in 1519, but if he had any contacts with the natives they must have been very limited.
The data referred to are, of course, those left us by Alvar
Nuiiez Cabeza de Vaca in "Los Naufragios~' ("The Shipwrecks"), first published in 1542; and the paraphrasing of

this narrative by the Spanish historian Oviedo y Valdez in
his "Historia General y Natural de Indias", Vol. III, book
XXV, pp. 582-618, written in about 1546.
An extensive study of the adventures of Ca:beza de Vaca
and his three companions, the sole survivors of the 600-man
expedition of Pamfilo de Narvaez, who lived among the
Texas coastal Indians for some six years before crossing the
continent to emerge on the Gulf of California, is under
preparation by the writer and is to be published in book
form. This will also include new translations of both original documents and will explain numerous conclusions made
about the direction of the route taken by the four survivors.
Therefore, these intriguing and vexing matters will not be
discussed here.
The Narvaez expedition left Spain in 1527 with the intention of colonizing some part of "Florida", which then included the whole northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico from
present Florida west and south to the fort of Panuco, established by Cortes near present Tampico, Mexico. After various disasters, about 250 men left present northwestern
Florida in five barges constructed by themselves and attempted to sail and paddle their way along the coast to
Panuco. In crossing the Mississippi River mouth, currents
and winds separated the five :barges but all were eventually
cast up at different places on the coast of Texas, in November 1528. Two of them, however, including that commanded
by Cabeza de Vaca, were cast up on the same island on successive days. Of the approximately 95 men in these two
barges, all but 15 died of sickness, cold, and hunger the first
winter, and within a year or two only four remained alive:
Cabeza de Vaca, Dorantes, Castillo, and Dorantes' Negro
slave, Estevanico. The occupants of the other three barges
were heard of from time to time as those of the first two
barges made their way along the central coast of Texas; but
all died in one way or another in a short time. Contrary to
popular belief, only a few of the 250 men were killed by
Indians and these were in a relatively small area.

Food Habits of the Texas CoastaL Indians

'11he narratives descr1be certain food habits of the natives
in three areas: (1) the island of Malhado (Bad Luck) where
the first two barges landed and the mainland nearby; (2) the
central coast of Texas in an area which undoubtedly included the shores of Matagorda, Lavaca, and San Antonio
Bays and the lower valley of Guadalupe River; and (3) the
South Texas monte, a great expanse of rolling plains with
little water, covered with thorny brush and cacti, which
stretches from the lower Nueces River southward to the Rio
Grande delta and westward across the Rio Grande into
Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
MALHADO
This island has often been identified as Galveston Island,
but this is much too large to fit the descriptions. More
likely, Malhado was the present Oyster Bay Peninsula, the
tip of which is a few miles southwest of Galveston Island.
Although this identification requires that what is now a
sandy peninsula was separated from the mainland over 400
years ago, it is becoming well known among geologists that
many alterations in the Texas coast line have occurred in
modern times >b y the actions of currents, sedimentation,
tides, winds and hurricanes.
The Indians of Malhado were called Han and Capoque.
They and those on the mainland nearby lived in a state of
near starvation the year around. Although one would naturally assume that plenty of fish and shellfish were available to them at all times, Cabeza de Vaca tells us that their
main diet consisted of roots collected at great labor. Some
roots were taken from under water and were said to have
tasted like nuts; others were dug from the ground with
sticks. Fish are mentioned several times but always with the
qualification that they were ''few" or "a little". Skates are
the only kind specifically named. No nets or spears are mentioned, but there were weirs and Oviedo states that fish were
killed from canoes. From this it might be inferred that fish
were speared from canoes, :b ut it is also possible that they
were shot with bow and arrow for this weapon is mentioned

50

Texas Archeological Society

repeatedly in other connections and is, in fact, the only
weapon named for any part of the Texas coast.
The roots that tasted like nuts were collected mainly in
November and December. By the end of February .the roots
were beginning to sprout and were then not good to eat. For
the next three months oysters were almost the sole article
of diet. This seems to have been during January, February,
and March but the statements are somewhat confusing and
the season may have been from February through April.
The harvest of oysters must have been considerable, for it
is said that the Indians placed their houses on top of oyster
beds-undoubtedly referring to piles of discarded shells.
The houses were portable, being carried about on canoes
and on human backs. It may be doubted that such dwellings
were substantial enough for the archeologist to find traces
of their postholes; and furthermore they must have stood on
the shell heaps only a quarter of the year.
AHer the oysters, !blackberries were the mainstay for one
month, either April or May. From May to November was
the most desperate time; herbs, roots, and fish were not
enough and the Indians had to turn to spiders, lizards,
snakes, mice, crayfish, etc., to exist.
Although there are no specific statements, one's impression is that these people never traveled very far in search
of food, merely passing back and forth between Malhado and
the mainland according to the season. They were on the island when the Spanish barges landed in November of 1528,
and they went to the mainland during the winter-that is,
during the oyster season. Cabeza de Vaca, having spent four
years in this area as a trader among the ilndians, did travel
considerably along the coast and as much as 50 leagues inland, but he gives no indication that the natives moved about
much, and he specifically states that during the coldest
months they stayed in their houses. Probably this was made
possible because the oysters were available in this season.
I should like to mention briefly certain facts bearing on
the commonly accepted "hokum" that these coastal Indians

Food Habits of the Texas Coastal Indians

51

were fierce cannibals. This notion is always given a big
play in newspaper articles and is perpetuated everywhere
in Texas by public school teachers. It sounds exciting and
it enables Texans to feel some justification for their extermination of these tribes in the 19th century. Anthropologists
and archeologists themselves have done little to counteract
this fallacy, nor have they objected too much to news stories
that report broken human bones as "evidence" of cannibalism. Any archeologist knows that split and broken human
bones are normal in excavated burials, due to the weight of
over-burden, action of plant roots, and other causes.
In some manner which I have never understood, the plain
statements of Cabeza de Vaca on thris subject have become
completely reversed. The narratives of both de Vaca and
Oviedo leave not the slightest doubt that two groups of the
Spaniards ate their own dead during the first terrible winter. Caheza de Vaca furthermore makes it crystal clear that
these Indians not only did not eat human flesh, but on the
contrary were so shocked on learning that the Spaniards had
done this that, if they had known, they would have killed
the 'Spaniards in advance for being so barbarous!
It is also beyond dispute that the Indians of Malhado
treated the shilpwrecked strangers with the greatest kindness they were capable of. The starved, naked, and nearly
frozen castaways were literally carried to the Indians' huts
while fires were built along the way to warm them. What
little food they had was cheerfully shared. The Spaniards
were also touched by the Indians "howling like brutes" at
their (the Spaniards') misfortunes. "Cannibals", indeed!

Other customs mentioned are interesting because they
tended to inc1·ease rather than to decrease starvation among
certain individuals. Thus: "When it happens that someone
marries off his daughter, from that day on everything that
the groom kills in hunting and fishing is brought by the
wife to the house of her father", and "when a son or brother
dies, in the house where he happens to die, during three
months they do not search for food, rather let themselves

52

Texas Archeological Society

die of hunger, and their relatives and neighbors provide
what they are to eat ... so that in the majority of houses
there was great famine on account of keeping this custom".
CENTRAL GULF COAST OF TEXAS
In this area the narratives outline two seasons of comparative plenty. In the late fall, probably November and
December, the Mariames and related tribes went to a river
which was undoubtedly the lower Guadalupe near present
Victoria, to eat pecans in large groves of these trees. During
three summer months, July through September, they made
an annual trip inland to gorge on ripe tunas (prickly-pear
fruit), traveling some 30 to 40 leagues from their homeland
on the coast. The length of these leagues presents a problem
but a figure of three miles to a league cannot be far off;
thus the distance was some 90 to 120 miles and I believe the
tuna grounds were in Atascosa County or thereabouts.
During both seasons other tribes came from far around to
take advantage of these two crops. They met, danced, feasted,
and traded during these times.
The pecan groves provided a great source of food but
possessed the defect that they gave abundant fruit one year,
but little or none the next year; at times two poor years
might pass before the trees again bore heavily. When nuts
were plentiful a further difficulty arose in that "the Indians
were very greedy with them" and people came from 20 to
30 leagues around to harvest them. This massing of Indians
at the groves resulted in all the game being immediately
flushed out and killed, so that all were hungry once more.
Extracting the nut meats is described as very laborious,
which of course is still true of the small native pecans; the
large, thin-shelled commercial pecans are a modern development. Oviedo states that some small grains were ground
up with the nuts.
The prickly pears, on the other hand, provided a constant,
abundant food supply every summer. Anyone familiar with
the tremendous expanses of prickly pear in South Texas can

Food Habits of the Texas CoastaL Indians

53

appreciate what an enormous quantity of sweet, easily digested food the tunas provided. Not only was the fruit eaten,
but pits were dug in the ground and tuna juice squeezed
into them, for there was little surface water in this country
and the Indians were constantly thirsty. It is said that there
was no pottery to hold the juice.2 The squeezed rinds were
dried and ground into a powder. Nothing else was eaten
during this season except large numbers of snails. A bitter
yellow drink was prepared from oak leaves, on which these
people became quite drunk. There was considerable ceremony about its preparation and women were forbidden to
come near during the drinking.
Aside from these two seasons, great hunger was the rule
the rest of the year. During the months before the tuna
season, some deer were killed, and crayfish and the meats
of "cockle shells" were eaten. Other foods were an herb
called yerba pedrera, blackberries, a few fish, spiders, ant
eggs, worms, salamanders, lizards, snakes (including poisonous ones), earth, wood, and deer dung. Cabeza de Vaca slyly
adds that "I verily believe that if there were any stones in
that land they would eat them too", thus revealing that the
Mariames and other tribes who held him and the other survivors had their homeland in a stoneless country. They even
kept the bones of fish, animals, and snakes, grinding them
into a powder which they could eat-a point of importance
to the archeologist when seeking to recover animal remains
in excavations.
In spite of this menu, it is said that roots of two or three
kinds were the main food in this season (the first six months
of the year) and that they "are very bad and swell those
that eat them. It takes two days to roast them and many of
them are very bitter, and on top of this it is very difficult to
dig them out." The women were able to rest only about six
2. This presents an archeological puzzle, for ample pottery is
found along the Texas coastal margin in a period which must have
included the 16th century (see article by T. N. Campbell which
precedes this one). It is possible that these tribes possessed pottery
in their homeland but did not bother to carry it to the tuna grounds,
less possible that the Rockport Focus did not exist until after 1534.

54

hours each night, spending each day searching for and digging out the roots, and stirring fires to dry and roast them
most of the night.
The men caught deer alive by running them down, following them from dawn to dark if need be. Oviedo mentions
an annual deer drive, probably in June as it was done when
the Indians were ready to move to the tuna grounds. At this
time one tribe might kill as many as two or three hundred
deer, but in some years they were unable to kill any in this
particular way. Oviedo describes the method as follows: the
people spread out from the shoreline inland, "like a wing",
and drove the deer toward the sea, using canoes to keep
them in the water until they drowned, after which the tide
washed them ashore. This method was said not to work,
however, if the wind did not blow from the sea toward the
land, "because the deer do not go except against the wind".
Probably this means that if the wind was from the north
instead of the south, the deer would smell the hunters and
could not be driven in the same direction as the wind (i. e.,
southward toward the shore). Thus the years in which no
deerr were killed in this way were probably those in which
the wind was wrong, rather than that the deer themselves
were absent. If the deer could not be driven, the Indians
proceeded to the tuna grounds, living as they could.
Those living along the lower Guadalupe River caught
some fish, but these were few unless the river was in flood.
It is said that the flood came in April and again in May.
During the second flood, a great quantity of very good fish
was killed, but most of it was wasted for they lacked salt or
any other method of preserving it.
The Indians of the central coastal area set fire to the fields
and forests for several reasons: to drive away mosquitos, to
drive lizards and other creatures out of the ground to eat
them, to kill deer by encircling them with fire, and to burn
pasture in some places so the deer would have to go to other
pastures and be easier to find and kill.
Cabeza de Vaca gives the first des,c ription known of the

Food Habits of the Texas Coastal Indians

55

American bison. The details are quite accurate and he must
have seen the animals himself. Robes, "shoes", and shields
were made of the hides. In spite of this, the bison were
probably not very near the coast, or they would have been
more important in the food resources there. Still, they must
have been within 50 leagues of the shore, which is the distance de Vaca says he went inland as a trader.

THE MONTE
In this region, starvation was the rule the year around
except during the summer tuna season. Although prickly
pears of several species undoubtedly grew throughout this
region, the natives moved about considerably within it because the tunas ripen first at the extreme south (in Tamaulipas and the Rio Grande delta area), then progressively
northward; and by the time the season is over in the northern parts (around San Antonio, say) another crop may ripen
in the south where the climate is warmer over a longer
season. At any rate, it is clear from the narratives that the
tribes in the monte shifted repeatedly in search of places
where the tunas would linger. As at the tuna grounds to
which the central coast tribes went in summer, the monte
tribes gathered here and there to visit, dance, trade, and
purchase wives.
Not only were the tunas eaten, but before they were ripe,
the green leaves of prickly-pear cacti were buried in pits
overnight to make them softer and more palatable, then
roasted. The narratives state that in this region there were
no nut trees (pecan, walnut, or oak), no streams or fish, and
nine months out of the year life hung in the balance for
everyone. All manner of insects, grubs, snakes, and creatures of every kind were consumed. Deer were killed occasionally but it is surprising that they were not numerous.
Cabeza de Vaca and his companions remained in this region for eight months after their escape from the central
coast Indians who had taken them to the tuna grounds which
they visited every summer. During these eight months, extending probably from late September 1534 to June 1535,

56

Texas Archeological Society

there was such a dearth of food that the Spaniards were too
weak to try to continue their journey toward Panuco. Although they were treated well enough in this region, and
by now had become venerated as gods through their ability
to "cure" the sick, Cabeza de Vaca says that he welcomed
the opportunity to scrape deer hides for the Indians because
this enabled him to eat the parings.
Here it is said that children were nursed to the age of 12,
after which they had to look for their own food. It is said
that the children would have died during times of famine
if they were not nursed, or at least would have grown sickly
and weak. While it may seem incredible to modern man that
children would be nursed to such an age, anthropologists
have found that this it not unusual among very primitive
people in different parts of the world who must battle constantly against starvation.
·
For about two weeks before the tunas ripened in the South
Texas monte, life was sustained by eating some "small
grains", usually identified as the seeds of the Mexican
ebony, which now grows in small groves about as far north
as Uvalde. A green fruit was also eaten at this time which
burned the mouth and which may have been unripe mesquite beans.
However, it was not until the day before the four survivors
reached the large river which I am sure must have been the
lower Rio Grande3 that the mesquite is definitely mentioned as food. The beans were ground with large wooden
pestles, about six feet long and as thick as a man's thigh,
pounded into pits in the ground. There is no mention of
mortars. The beans were mixed with earth as they were
ground, to sweeten them, and the Indians' bellies swelled
greatly from the mixture of meal, earth, and water.
3. In my extended study of the route, reasons are given for thinking that this river was crossed somewhere between Zapata and Rio
Grande City, Texas. It is quite possible that the Rio Grande was
reached by following either the Arroyo Belefio or the Arroyo Los
Olmos, in Zapata and Starr County, respectively. For the course
of Arroyo Los Olmos, see Figure 2 in the article by Frank Al Weir
in this Bulletin.

Food Habits of the Texas Coastal Indians

57

Elsewhere, as in southern Arizona in historic times, it is
known that mesquite beans provided an enormous source of
food, particularly where some method of storage was used.
Although the Cabeza de Vaca narratives give no indication
of food storage anywhere along the route until much later,
it is undoubtedly of some significance that as soon as they
met these people who ground mesquite beans near the lower
Rio Grande, figures are given on the size of the communities,
indicating that the villages were larger than :those encountered from Malhado up to this vicinity. The first people met
who used these beans had more than 50 dwellings; and the
next day, on the banks of the Rio Grande, a village was
entered which included more than 100 dwellings. In the next
day or two, other villages were seen which must have been
equally populous. Although there is no proof that the use
of mesquite beans was the direct cause of increase in village
size in this area; such a deduction seems reasonable.
SUMMARY
Only the barest details have been mentioned here from the
material in the Cabeza de Vaca narratives. They suffice to
show something of how the Indians of coastal and South
Texas managed to exist, and much of the data agree well
with archeological information from these areas, as will be
brought out in other publications. None of the people mentioned prac't iced agriculture, as Cabeza de Vaca himself
states.
One matter is quite puzzling: The food resources of these
three areas do not at present seem to be as forbidding as
the conditions actually seen by Cabeza de Vaca. This gives
rise to several interesting questions. Have the land and
food resources changed considerably in 400 years? There
are some indications that they have, especially in the mission records of the 18th century, which describe the lower
Rio Grande region as a vast expanse of rich grassland at
that time. Was the perpetual hunger of the early 16th century the result of very poor food resources, or had the population density reached the point where there was not enough

58

Texas Archeological Society

food for all? Whatever the case, it is fascinating to realize
that, despite the most trying physical conditions imaginable,
these primitive natives existed in a happy mental condition.
If there are any psychologists present, I should like to
point out two matters of great interest. One is Cabeza de
Vaca's repeated statement that "despite their hunger and
suffering, these people are the happiest in the world, constantly dancing, singing, and celebrating as though they had
no cares". A similar condition has been noted among other
peoples living a constant battle between life and starvation,
as for example the Eskimos. Gnawing hunger, cold, fatigue,
lack of any possessions to speak of, do not prevent them
from maintaining a constant cheerfulness. Or perhaps it is
the other way around: if they had any different attitude,
they might not be able to exist at all in the particular environments they happen to be in. Conversely, troubles, worries, and mental disturbances seem to increase in proportion
to wealth, possessions, and ease of living.

The other matter is that personal quarrels were settled
among these people by their beating one another to exhaustion, with no weapons allowed. Having thus taken out their
resentments, and their anger having cooled, they went about
their daily business as though nothing had happened. Here
again we have a simple but effective method for achieving
"mental health".

SURFACE ARTIFACTS FROM LA PERDIDA,
STARR COUNTY, TEXAS 1
FRANK

AL

WEIR

La Perdida is an archeological site located about nine
miles north of Rio Grande City in Starr County (Fig. 2).
It is on the northeast bank of Arroyo Los Olmos, a creek
which begins west of Hebbronville and flows some 70 miles
southward to join the Rio Grande just below Rio Gl'ande
City. The arroyo is frequently dry because local rain is its
only source of water.
The importance of the site is brought out by the fact that
Paleo-American material in the form of Clovis, Plainview,
Meserve, Scottsbluff, and Angostura points has been found
with •a great variety and abundance of artifacts usually assigned to the Archaic stage.2 Although Paleo-American
points have been found on other South Texas sites (Sellards,
1940; Orchard and Campbell, 19'54) and in Tamaulipas just
across the Rio Grande (R. de la Borbolla and Aveleyra,
1953), no other site in this region, to the knowledge of the
writer, has yielded such a variety.
The La Perdida site was first discovered in the summer
of 1955 by Milton B. Newton of McAllen, Texas. Mr. Newton, Bob Schutz, and the writer have made several expeditions to the site since then. During this period evidence of
only one hearth was observed. This hearth, consisting of
burned sandstone slabs, is the only one lined with sandstone
to be discovered in the area, to my know ledge. Most hearths
in the Los Olmos area are of thermal-fractured flint, chert,
and agate, the most common stones of the area. It should
also be noted that thousands of flint spalls and snail shells
occur in the site.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE
The site itself is exceptionally large for this area. It is
approximately 400 yards long, and 150 yards wide, and, because of stream erosion, is shaped roughly like a horseshoe.
Because of its size it has been suggested that it may be several overlapping sites. There are, however, no visible means
of determining whether this is true or not.
The site has been exposed by water and wind action which
has formed gullies, washes, and blowouts ranging in depth
from a few inches to many feet in some places. The soil exposed is clearly defined into three strata. The first or top
stratum 'is an almost white sand deposit of high alkali content. In the immediate area this deposit is about 12 inches in
thickness. The second stratum, separated disconformably
from the first, is a very dark humus deposit ranging in thickness from 2 to 6 feet. It has been observed that most of the
archeological material was being eroded from the upper limits of this stratum and from the sandy stratum. The third
and last exposed stratum, also discon£ormably separated
from the second, is a tan Pleistocene clay. Incorporated in
this clay are small granules of calkhe, but these occupy only
an extremely small percentage of the deposit. At least 7 feet
of this particular deposit has been exposed by the arroyo.3
Over the entire arroyo the sand and clay deposits are always
present, but the humus deposits are completely absent in
many localities.
The most common plants observed are mesquite, small
thorn trees, grasses, and various cacti. Evidences of deer,
javalina, coyote, and rodent are also present. Undoubtedly
some of these plants and animals were present during occupation of the site and were part of the Indian subsistence.
3. It is of interest to note that remains of two elephants have
been found being eroded from the clay deposits in the lower Arroyo Los Olmos area. One, an adult, was found about four miles
north of La Perdida, and the other, a smaller individual, was found
slightly more than a mile south of Perdida. Gravel was found underlying both animals. No artifacts were reported in association.

ARTIF.NCTS OF CHIPPED STONE
During July, 1955, approximately 900 artifacts were collected by Newton, Schutz, and the writer. These include
choppers, side and end scrapers, gouges, gravers, "drills",
knives, projectile points, shell ornaments, and grooved
stones. A number of worked flakes were found but their
use is indefinite.

Choppers or fist axes (52) (Plate 6, A). These are very
common throughout South Texas. They average about 9 em.
in diameter and 3 to 8 em. in thickness. The cutting edges
were made by percussion. All of the choppers retain a large
amount of the original waterworn and patinated flint surface (Plate 6, A).
Scrapers (about 200). Almost 75 per cent of those found
are side scrapers, the remainder being end scrapers. With
few exceptions the side scrapers are rough with either
straight or convex bits. In general the end scrapers do not
run as large as the side scrapers but the workmanship on
both is similar. All of the end scrapers have convex bits.
"Blade gouges" (11) (Plate 6, E-F). Actually these are
end scrapers chipped on the thick edges of broken blade
fragments and are fairly common (Cason 1952: 225). They
were made from both the bases and the tips of both projectile points and biface knives. All are well made and run
to a maximum length of 4 em. Only one of these was made
from a stemmed projectile point (Plate 9, F).
Gouges (4) (Plate 6, B). Three bi-convex and one bi-concave gouge, referred to by Dr. Cyrus N. Ray as Clear Fork
gouges, were found. These artifacts are well worked on both
faces with one beveled, convex or concave end. Many gouges
of the same forms occur on other sites in the vicinity.
Gravers (5) (Plate 6, D). These are made from flint
spalls with each specimen having only a single small projection or beak. They show retouching only around these
beaks and range from 2 to 5 em. across.

"Drills" (2) (Plate 9, S). These are probably the rarest of
flaked artifacts from this area. Only two were found at this
site. One is a drill tip of tan chert. The other is a basal fragment which is made of opaque agate. The basal fragment is
3.5 em. long and 3 em. wide, and the width of the drill projection is 9 mm. This drill was probably reworked from a
Tortugas point, the most common type of projectile point at
this site.
Knives (about 150) (Plate 6, G-K). These are triangular
or leaf-shape with most specimens having either straight or
convex edges, but a few having asymmetrical edges. They
range in length from '5 to 10 em. The grade of workmanship
runs from very poor to fine.
Projectile Points. A total of 289 points was collected from
the site. The identified types are Tortugas, Lerma, Abasolo,
Matamoros, Catlin, Refugio, Pandora, Desmuke, Langtry,
Kent, Shumla, Lange, and CastrovilLe. The Paleo-American
types are Clovis, Plainview, Angostura, Scottsbluff, and
Meserve.
Tortugas (94) (Plate 7, A-J). This type is the most common at La Perdida, making up almost one-third of the total
found. These are triangular in form with straight and slightly convex blade edges, a few having slightly recurved edges.
The bases are straight, concave, or slightly convex. Basal
thinning is common in this type (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks,
1954: 482) . The bases of 68 specimens have been thinned
by short longitudinal flaking. The grade of workmanship
on most of these points is good to fine. All specimens are
flint or chert with the exceptions of A and I on Plate 7,
which are petrified wood.
Lerma (51) (Plate 7, K-0). These constitute the second
m ost frequent type from the site. Their blades are slender
and pointed at both ends (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954:
440. The edges are convex and the workmanship is usually
fine.
Abasolo (32) (Plate 8, A-E) . The blade edges of these

66

Texas Archeological Society

points are convex with a few being beveled. Bases are also
convex. All specimens are chert except the largest (Plate
8, A), which is translucent agate.

Matamoros (18) (Plate 8, 0-R). This type is the most
abundant of the small dart points. Except for size, the general outline is the same as the Tortugas.
Catan (11) (Plate 8, M-N). Again, like the Matamoros
points compared with the Tortugas points, the general outline of the Catan points is the same as that of the Abasolo
points, the difference being in size (Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks, 1954: 410).
Refugio (10) (Plate 8, F). All are slender leaf-shaped
blades with either parallel or slightly convex edges and convex bases. Most of these points are rather thick in cross
section (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 474). The single
specimen illustrated is petrified wood.
Pandora (11) (Plate 8, G-I). Like Refugio points, Pandora
are slender, leaf-shaped blades with either parallel or convex
edges. They differ from Refugio in having straight bases.
Desmuke (9) (Plate 8, J-L). All of these small, shoulderless, and roughly lozenge-shaped points (Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks, 1954: 416) are chert.
Langtry (11) (Plate 9, A-E). Contrary to most descriptions of this type, all but two specimens have convex blade
edges. A typical Langtry has slightly concave or straight
blade edges (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 438). The
Langtry points from La Perdida have contracting stems with
straight, convex, or irregular bases.
Kent (5) (Plate 9, P-Q). These are slender, stemmed
points with slightly convex blade edges. The stem edges are
straight with slightly convex to straight bases having rounded corners. Shoulders are almost absent on some specimens.
Shumla (3) (Plate 9, 0). These are strongly barbed, basal-notched points. The blade edges are slightly convex.
The stem edges are straight or slightly expanding with

slightly convex bases (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 480).
The complete specimen illustrated is flint, 5 em. long and
4cm. wide.
Castroville (10) (Plate 9, F-J). All of these are shouldered and have convex blade edges. The stems are large and
slightly expanding with straight or slightly convex bases.
It is notable that all the Castroville points found here are
shouldered rather than barbed. In central Texas the barbed
form is far more common than the shouldered (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 408).
Lange (8) (Plate 9, K-N). These points are shouldered or
slightly barbed. The stems are small and expanding with
either straight or slightly convex bases. The blade edges are
slightly convex. All specimens are chert or flint except
Plate 9, N, which is a reworked point of chalcedony. In outline several of the Lange points are similar to Castroville
points but the stems are not as broad.
The following types are generally considered to belong to
the Paleo-American stage:

Plainview (6) (Plate 10, B-G). This is probably the most
common early type in this area. Of those found, only one is
complete (Plate 10, G). All specimens are finely chipped
chert. Blade edges are straight to slightly recurved. Although the recurving is exaggerated on the specimen in
Plate 10, C, this is probably a variant of the Plainview type
(Krieger, personal communication).
Meserve (1) (Plate 10, A). This specimen is flint and
shows fine workmanship. It is 6 em. long and 2.5 em. wide.
The diagnostic beveling of the blade, which is to the right on
both faces, begins 3.4 em. from the base and extends to the
tip. Like at least some of the Meserve points found widely
in Texas, it may originally have been a Plainview point
which was later beveled (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954:
450). Haynes (1955: 148) has suggested that some of these
early points were designed with long bodies, so that if the
tip was broken off they could be re-pointed and still have
enough of the original blade left for effective use. Possibly
this was the case with this specimen.

Angostura (4) (Plate 10, J -M and possibly I). These wide
but narrow-based, leaf-shaped points are well worked and
made of chert. Specimen I, Plate 10, is somewhat like an
Angostura point and was found close to other Angostura
points, but no definite classification can be given because
it is very thick in cross-section, is percussion-chipped, and
has no basal smoothing.
Scottsbluff (3) (Plate 10, N-P). No complete specimens
were found, but what we have to work with gives a suggestion of straight and parallel blade edges. The stem edges
are parallel to slightly expanding with straight bases. Fine
workmanship is shown in all specimens. Specimen Q, Plate
10, in some respects resembles the Scottsbluff type. Small
shoulders are represented and a great deal of basal smoothing is present. Except for the basal expansion and concavity,
point Q might have been classified as Scottsbluff. A point
from the Pinos Mountain area in New Mexico, illustrated
by Haynes (1955; Plate 19, K), is almost exactly like this
south Texas point.
Clovis (1) (Plate 10, H). This is possibly the most significant of the Paleo-American finds. The specimen, a basal
fragment, is deeply fluted on both faces and has an extreme
amount of basal smoothing on all but the broken edges. It
seems to have had parallel sides and a deeply concave base
with a width of 2.5 em. The specimen is well worked and is
made from a gray flint which is uncommon in this area, but
is extremely common in central Texas. This artifact may
therefore have been imported from that area.

Only one arrow point was found and it should probably
be classified as an eccentric shape (Plate 9, R). It is 4.5 em.
long and 3 em. wide. The edges are concave and the base is
strongly indented, forming "ears". Such points are very
rare in this area and are prized by many Rio Grande Valley
collectors.

mately 20 fragments of various kinds of marine shells were
found at La Perdida. Only two of these were definitely
identified as artifacts: a small pendant and a bead carved
from conch shell (Plate 7, P -Q). Such artifacts and many
others carved from shell are common in the Rio Grande
delta area (Anderson, 1932).
Found near the sandstone hearth mentioned above was a
grooved awl sharpener (Plate 6, C). This specimen, of gray
sandstone, measures 8 em. long, 7 em. wide, and 3.5 em. thick.
The two grooves, both in the same face, are 4 em. and 3 em.
long. Both are pointed, rounded, and smooth inside.
DISCUSSION
After nine of the "early" points had been found at La
Perdida (Plate 10, B, C, E, F, I, J, M, P, Q) in a single wash
approximately 20 feet across, along with numerous artifacts
of the Archaic stage, it was suspected that artifacts of the
Archaic stage might have become mixed with those of an
earlier or Paleo-American stage by slumping as the result
of erosion. This theory is not feasible, however, for this
wash is no deeper, if as deep, as the surrounding eroded
areas where many Archaic artifacts are found, but no "early"
points.
Next the possibility of cultural overlap was considered.
That is, people of the Paleo-American stage may still have
been living in the area at the advent of Archaic culture.
This theory is weakened by the fact that the "early" points
fo und r epresent several different time levels farther north,
in the Great Plains region .
A third possibility is that of importation. It seems logical
that later Indians would now and then find artifacts of
earlier origin and, through curiosity, carry them back to
their camps and perhaps even re-use them. Except for the
flint of the Clovis point fragment (Plate 10, H), the flint
and chert of th e other "early" points can be fo und both in
Central and in South Texas, but are more common in South
Texas.

78

Texas Archeological Society

The question of where later Indians could have found
these points, however, is still unanswered. As yet no pure
Paleo- American sites have been isolated in Southwest,
South, or Central Texas although several hundred of the
"early" points have been reported from these areas. Only
further research can answer the questions brought up by
the La Perdida site.

AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY OF
BIRD-FORM VESSELS
CARL

B.

COMPTON

The manipulation of clay to express the will of the potter
or maker of figurines is a fascinating process. It is surprising that the use of clay was so long delayed in the developmental process of man, coming long after he had attained
remarkable proficiency in the fashioning of implements from
wood, bone and the hardest of stone. When he did discover
the process of making objects from clay, and especially when
he discovered the rather amazing fact that baking dried clay
would make a sort of artificial stone, he quickly produced a
great number and variety of clay artifacts. Probably most of
these were utilitarian in purpose but many of them were obviously sacred vessels used in ceremonies of one sort or another. Of the very many different and diverse forms which
may be found in vessels throughout the world, and especially
in the world of prehistoric man, there are a few which have
a rather widespread distribution both in space and time.
S'ome of these are of such a form as to provoke numerous
speculations concerning their possible use, the reason for
their widespread distribution, and, in some cases, the possible
significance which was attached to them in the minds of prehistoric peoples. This study is concerned with one of these
forms.
A rather annoying handicap in making a distribution
study of any vessel form is the fact that the published or
publicly exhibited archeological materials of the world comprise but a small part of those which have been recovered.
Too, there are many promising archeological sites which
thus far have either not been examined at all or only to an
insignificant degree. In other areas, as for example West
Mexico, which furnishes a tremendous number of pottery
vessels of many sorts, chronology is extremely vague. This
study will depend very largely on published or publicly exhibited materials. Even so, there is enough available material for the present purpose, though it should be borne in

80

Texas Archeological Society

mind and emphasized that this is merely a preliminary examination of the distribution of a particular vessel-form.
In examining the vessel forms used by aboriginal peoples,
one may notice that certain forms recur in rather diverse
and widely-separated culture. Important among these forms
is that shaped more or less like the body of a waterfowl.
While such forms occur in stone, wood, and occasionally in
metal, by far the largest group is that made of pottery.
These vary in form from definitely effigy vessels to those
so highly stylized that some persons consider them to be
merely "lopsided vessels". In this latter case, the craftsmanship is so expert that the "lopsided vessel" idea becomes
highly illogical.
It is first necessary in any classification and in the tracing
of the distribution of a vessel form that the item in question
be exactly and definitely established and understood. In
discussion of the form now in point we must make clear
exactly what is meant by the form discussed, and to separate
it from all other forms, in all instances where similarities of
accident or somewhat parallel shape might obscure the issue.

The "ideal" bird-form vessel is possibly best typified by
the example shown in Figure 3, from the Whitewater district
of eastern Arizona. It is, first of all, a v essel capable of containing something. It may be fairly large or, in some interesting cases to be mentioned later , miniature. The body is
shaped somewhat like that of a duck or it is abstracted from
the shape of a watevfowl. It often has a wide, cylindrical
neck set in the position of the neck of a waterfowl; this neck
may vary from an inch to several inches in length. In other
examples there is n o neck but a large opening at t he t op of
the vessel, usually set asymmetrically. This causes one "end"
of the vessel to be longer than the other. In still other cases
the vessels might best be characterized as "bird-effigies",
though the degree of naturalism may vary from quit e accurate copies of nature to very stylized for m s. Frequ ently
we find vessels which have small knobs or other stylization
of wings and tail but which may not exhibit any other birdlike features. In still other cases where little resemblance

An Introductory Survey of Bird-Form Vessels

81

to the shape of a bird or fowl is exhibited, a bird-face will be
modeled or painted on the "front" of the vessel; at other
times wings may be painted on the sides. In still other cases
the degree of abstraction is so great that investigators have
not been reminded of the duck-form at all but have called
the vessels "shoe-shaped".In the matter of provenience of the "shoe-shape" it should
be noted that those which most resemble a shoe or high
moccasin most often come from r egions where the shoe or
m occasin was unknown before the Conquest. It is quite true
that there are examples extant which are plainly copies of

Fig. 3. Type-form of the bird-form vessel, from Whitewater
district, eastern Arizona (after Roberts, 1940, Fig. 13).

82

Texas Archeological Society

shoes or high moccasins (Fig. 7, T, Z), but these are either
historic in time or come from cultures which knew and used
shoes or moccasins. We find ceramic shoes in graves under
the Agora in Athens, for example, which are actual copies of
shoes worn by the people of the time. In the case of the
American examples just mentioned above, and other similar
examples, this may represent a survival of form without a
survival of original meaning or significance. This is the case
with Oaxaca contemporary examples (Fig. 8, H) which are
used for boiling milk; and with the contemporary Tsintsuntsan examples (Fig. 9, F, CC), which, so far as can be
ascertained, have as their purpose attracting the eye of the
tourist.

It is the contention of this paper that the shoe-shaped
vessels, some forms of which are actually known as patojos
(duck-like) in Mexican publications where more naturalistic
representations are called efigies, are, in most cases, intended
to represent the form of a bird or fowl or that the shape was
originally suggested by such a form. In some cases the contention is beyond any reasonable doubt since the examples
show unmistakable stylizations of wings and tail (Fig. 9,
E). In still other cases the shoe-shape, or even a "submarine" shape, will have the head of a bird (Fig. 4, U) . It
would seem a legitimate assumption that other forms which
are virtually identical with these but which do not bear the
bird indicants are, nevertheless, intended to represent a bird
form.

all vessels discussed in this paper, whether they be effigy
or shoe-shaped, as "bird-form". An exception will be made
for a few vessels mentioned for comparative purposes which
are obviously and unmistakably intended to represent shoes
or moccasins. These have been mentioned above.
Another peculiarity in regard to the vessels discussed is
that apparently the very well-crafted and finely decorated
examples were more or less coexistent with the cruder and
more highly abstracted ones. This may be an unimportant
point since in any region and time there is considerable
variation in craftsmanship among individual ceramic items.
There seems to be neither a regional nor a chronological
difference between vessels with handles and those without
handles, or between those with one h andle and those with
two handles. In certain regions one of these latter variations
may predominate, as in Tennessee and Georgia where the
two-handled variety seems more common, though this may
be accidental and unimportant. In all cases the decoration
and design motifs, where decoration is present, follow the
general design patterns of the region; there is no general
design used exclusively for bird-form vessels, nor is there
any design motif common to all regions (or even to any two
regions) where such regions show no obvious inter-relationships.

day in certain areas already mentioned. In certain regions,
as in West Mexico, the chronology of the area is so uncertain as to make placement in time of the vessels difficult if
not impossible. In Europe and Asia the form seems to show
more examples in the Neolithic with some extension into
the Bronze Age. Since the Americas were very largely in
a quasi-Neolithic stage until Columbian times, the bird-form
vessel might almost be said to be a Neolithic trait. In the
South Pacific (Fig. 12, B, W), bird-form vessels, though of
wood and not of ceramic, are actually contemporary, though
one might make a reasonable case that the cultures in this
area were essentially of Neolitic pattern.
No very definite chronology can be assigned to the American examples as a group. Certain examples can be definitely dated but this leaves us little better off since they are
geographically so scattered. There are several varieties from
Tlatilco in the Valley of Mexico (Porter, 19'53) which date
from the third century B. C. Vaillant (1934) placed them in
his pre-'Maya "Q" complex. The Late Basketmaker and
Early Pueblo examples would date from around 900 A. D.
Very fine examples, both miniature and normal size, are
found in the Chupicuaro and Tsintsuntsan areas of West
Mexico and may date from as early as 200 B. C. to as late as
1450 A. D., while equally typical examples may be found in
the Oaxaca and Tsintsuntsan areas made by contemporary
potters, as previously remarked. Probably the Tsintsuntsan
items are revivals of old forms at the suggestion of the Centro Regional de Educacion Fundamental para America Latina, which is fomenting activity in the crafts of that area.

PURPOSE OR USE

While it is not the purpose of this paper to establish anything in the nature of a theory or even to insist on an hypothesis regarding the purpose or use of these bird-form
vessels, the number of them found as mortuary vessels,
grave furniture, or in situations which suggest mortuary
association, almost forces us to the conclusion that there was
likely some connection between this vessel form and the
idea of death. That the duck or bird is so associated widely
in time and space may be seen in the bird-on-a-stick drawing
associated with an obviously dead hunter (who himself has
the head of a bird) in the Lascaux cave drawings of France
(Breuil, 1952, Pl. 14); in the Alaskan bird-on-a-stick gravesticks (Mallery, 1893, Fig. 459, C, G); and in the bird-on-astick of the "soul houses" of the Saora of Eastern India
(Elwin, 1955, pp. 346-347). Similar examples from other
areas could easily be found but these will serve to illustrate
the point.
In many of the regions where the bird-form vessels have
been found they are very definitely burial vessels. Weeden
Island examples cited by Sears (1953, p. 226) are listed as
mortuary vessels. Though the Tarascan examples frequently
contain the bones of infants, there are not enough of these
vessels to account for any very significant number of burials,
infant or otherwise. For this reason the possibility might be
entertained that they were either cult vessels and that the
bones were those of sacrificed infants, or that only the bones
of infants of certain social classes were so interred. These
would in any case be secondary burials since the vessels are
too small to contain the body of even the tiniest normal inFig. 7. Bird-Form vessels. A, Chimu, Peru (Means, 1936, Fig.

fant. Support for a cult explanation might derive from the
fact that some of these vessels are miniature, some being
less than two inches in overall length. Also lending some
support to this idea is the fact that at Tsintsuntsan, the prehispanic Tarascan capitol, there were found many of these
tiny patojos accompanying burials of women. Of course, in
the absence of corroborative evidence, this is speculation.
Any discussion of the purpose or use of these vessels is
likely to be less than satisfactory for several reasons. For
one thing, the various writers whose published works show
photographs or drawings of these vessels are remarkably
reticent, on the whole, about speculation as to the purpose
of the vessels. Again, it is quite apparent that no one significance attaches to all of the examples. The Roman vessels are obviously pitchers or urns or ewers, and many were
found among domestic utensils at Pompeii. This does not
rule out the possibility that they were used in domestic
ceremonies of some sort, but there is no evidence that they
were. Examples from such diverse places as Egypt (Fig. 11,
B) and El Salvador (Fig. 5, Z) are obviously bottles for
holding liquids. The Northwest Coast examples shown (Fig.
8, U-W) are in two cases bowls or deep dishes for holding
food, and the other a stone mortar. The examples from the
South Pacific (Fig. 12, B, W) are religious ceremonial bowls
for holding food offered to the gods.
More examples are listed as being mortuary objects or
burial furniture than are listed as having other uses or purposes. These include such vessels as a bowl of rock crystal

from Mycaenae (Fig. 12, S) described as burial furniture,
and a rather similar bowl of pottery from the Mississippi
Valley (Fig. 5, W) which was also burial furniture. In the
"Tarascan" area of Mexico, as mentioned above, these are
usually burial furniture while examples from other areas of
Mexico are described as burial-urns. Bird-form vessels from
Tuxcacuesco, Jalisco, were described as burial furniture as
were innumerable others from Nicaragua (Fig. 6, K-Q),
Panama (Fig. 7, M-0), and elsewhere. Stirling (1949) describes some rock-cut tombs from Panama as being of shoeshape. Edith Hall (1912-1914) presents many examples of
bird-form vessels as burial furniture from Crete. These citations could be multiplied almost endlessly.
DISTRIBUTION
The provenience of many examples has been mentioned
already. Suffice to say that examples may be found throughout the world in areas where pottery was made and even in
many areas where pottery was rare or unknown. In these
latter places the examples are of stone, wood, horn, or other
material.
Though the distribution of the bird- form is virtually
world-wide, possibly the most examples have been published from the Americas, particularly from the Southwest
United States and Mesoamerica. Likely the greatest single
concentration of these vessels is in Nicaragua and Costa
Rica (Fig. 10). In lowland South America relatively little

archaeological work has been done; more intensive excavation may produce more bird-form vessels. In the Classic
cultures of the Americas, especially of Peru, bird-form vessels exist but they seem merely to be effigy forms and there
is no reason to suppose that they had any different significance than the effigy vessels of other animals. In spite of
their scarcity in the Classic periods, the bird-form likely has
the widest and most constant distribution in the Americas
of any single complex vessel form .
We find such vessels in Georgia and Tennessee in the
lower Mississippi Valley (Fig. 8, C, D), in Arkansas (Fig.
6, X) , in profusion in Late Basketmaker and Early Pueblo
sites in Arizona and New Mexico (Fig. 6, A-D) , and from
Texas (Figs. 5, M; 9, D) . Farther south they are found in
the Tres Zapotes site in Veracruz (Fig. 6, S); and farther
west they are quite common in the Tarascan area (Figs. 6,
T; 9, D, E, G, I, J, CC) . Noguera (1930) shows an example
from the Teotihuacan area (Fig. 7, P) which is of a boot or
shoe shape. Still farther south there are examples from
northeastern Argentia (Fig. 6, E, F, G, U, V). Colombia has
a few (Fig. 6, H-J) ; there is a somewhat questionable example from the Late Chimu period of Coastal Peru (Fig. 5,
K) ; and one distinctly of bird-form but covered with fishforms from Peru (Fig. 8, G). There are some highly interesting examples from the mouth of the Amazon in Brazil
(Fig. '5, Y; 7, E-G), and also from the Chiriqui culture of
Panama (Fig. 7, B-D, H-J). Well down into Chili we h ave
perhaps the southernmost example cited (Fig. 7, X) .
Puerto Rico furnishes an example which is completely
r ound and has no neck whatever, the body being an oblate
spheroid (Fig. 6, Z) . This vessel has stylized wings and tail
and even an owlish face in low relief; this face compares in

almost exact detail with another highly variant example
from Brazil (Fig. 7, G) which is listed as a burial urn (Nordenskiold, 1930, Fig. 8), although in this latter example the
neck is greatly enlarged and is of extended height. Another
example from Argentina (Fig. 6, U), has two conical supports at the "front" end, the body ending in a dull point; the
vessel also has stubby, stylized wings. Somewhat similar to
this is a vessel from Arkansas (Fig. 6, X), already mentioned, which has stubby tetrapod supports, the body-form
being similar to that of the Argentine vessel. This Arkansas
vessel might almost be classed as a miniature since the overall height is given as six inches of which about one-third is
accounted for by the neck. Similar vessels are reported from
Texas (Fig. 5, M) and elsewhere.
There are numerous vessels with bases, sometimes cylindrical, at other times more or less conical. A vessel from
Florida (Fig. 4, Z) is a good example, as are three from
Weeden Island, Georgia (Fig. 7, U-W), which are rather
highly stylized but unmistakably bird-form, being provided
with beaks and tails and having wing-forms incised. Stirling
(1949) reports examples from Panama (Fig. 7, M, N) which,
while being definitely bird-form, have a round rather than
duck-shaped body. In these, the tail and wings consist of
quite large flat pieces of clay attached to the body in a manner suggestive of airplane wings, and both vessels have
more or less realistic bird heads added. Both have bases.
One of them (Fig. 7, N) has a high, pedestal-like base in the
form of a truncated cone.

Brazil furnishes a most interesting variant in which the
typical shoe-like bird form is surmounted by a much smaller
vessel of the same shape. This is the sole example of such a
pick-a-back vessel encountered in this study (Fig. 7, E).
Outside of the Americas the examples are both fairly
numerous and quite interesting in form. In excavations in
both the eastern and western portions of Crete, Hall (1912;
1914) found numerous examples of bird-form vessels (Fig.
12, F, H, I) as burial furniture in tombs of the Neolithic
period. These are very reminiscent of American forms. One,
which the author definitely describes as bird-form, resembles one from Texas reported by A. Krieger (Fig. 5,
M) and one from the eastern U. S. (Fig. 5, N) except that
the Cretan example has a handle while the ones from the
United States do not. Still another Cretan bird-shape, obviously a dipper, is startlingly similar to a Tlingit ceremonial dipper of horn (Fig. 9, A). A bowl from Lerma (Fig.
12, J), which is not markedly bird-like in form, not only is
rather similar to certain American examples but is claimed
by McCaskey (1944) to be "a curious and interesting birdshaped polychrome vase". From the excavations at Bronze
Age Jerico comes a highly interesting example, obviously
bird-form, with a small snake represented as crawling over
the rim of the vessel (Fig. 12, A).
An example from an Etruscan tomb (Fig. 12, K), though
having well-defined and obvious wings, has a human face

recalling the Greek myth of the Harpies. Still another Etruscan example (Fig. 12, 0) is definitely a bird effigy. Examples from the Russian Armenian Iron Age (Fig. 12, M) ;
from under the Athenian Agora in Mycacnean burials (Fig
12, P); and from Neolithic Halberstadt (Fig. 12, R), are very
similar to American examples. A Mycaenean bowl of rock
crystals (Fig. 12, S) is reminiscent of Northwest Coast vessels of st0ne and wood. A perusal of the accompanying
plates will show numerous similarities between bird-form
vessels from diverse proveniences.
SUMMARY
In summation it would seem that the similarities between
the various examples would be covered by a statement once
made by Philip Drucker in discussing an entirely different
situation when he said: " ... these are matters of opinion
and depend, in the last analysis, on the degree of likeness
one demands for 'similarity'." Be this as it may, the thesis
of this paper is that the bird-form is perhaps the most widely
distributed complex vessel form in the Americas or in early
Europe and Asia.
In looking at Figures 3 to 12 it will be seen that many
vessels obviously intended to be bird-form (because of the
presence of wings and tail) are essentially similar to those
which we would ordinarily classify as shoe-shape or "freeform"; and even the purist who would insist upon almost
exact duplication for "similarity" could scarcely cavil at
them. Roberts' plate of "bird-shaped and ring-bottom pitchers" (1940, Pl. 14) includes an example, shown here in Figure 6 D, which is about as highly abstracted as possible and
is certainly far less bird-shaped than most of the examples
used in the present study. If we allow the possession of two
or more of the essential characteristics as admitting a vessel
to bird-form category, then there would be few of the examples used which could not qualify. There are a few examples which are admittedly questionable. Certain historic
examples presented are unquestionably representations of
shoes or moccasins, but even here it is possible that the shape
of the shoe or moccasin recalled the form of the much older

and traditional bird-form vessel whose meaning had, by historic times, either been forgotten or had fallen into contempt. If we should assume that the distribution of the form
in the Americas is the result of diffusion, this study should
serve to indicate rather strongly the result and efficiency
of trade and inter-relation in precolumbian times. H would
be a foolhardy and certainly unsupported concept to assume
that the European and Asiatic forms were diffused into the
Americas, and one which would certainly be hotly assailed
by many, if not most, archaeologists.
The most curious element in the matter of the bird-form
vessels is not the fact that an effigy vessel representing a
bird should have such wide distribution, for that is more or
less to be expected among non-literate, nature-oriented
peoples. The curious point is that the stylization should
be so widespread and, by and large, so similar. We have
already noted that most of the peoples who produced these
vessels were unacquainted with the shoe and moccasin and
could not, therefore, have been intending to copy that shape.
Thus, either the shoe-like form was an abstraction, stylization, or development out of the form of the waterfa.wl, or it
was an accidental creation of pure form. It is not an overly
utilitarian shape, certainly not as useful as the gourd-shape.
It seems to be over-taxing accident and independent invention rather heavily to assume that so many examples of a
single form should have been produced accidentally by potters experimenting with "pure form". At least a certain
amount of diffusion and the consideration of a certain natural point of departure are easier to credit. The problem
will likely repay further study, which the present writer
proposes to continue.

A BURNT-ROCK MIDDEN SITE IN TRAVIS
COUNTY
H. F.

STURGIS

IN~RODUC'illON

On several occasions, and probably in common with most
amateurs, the author has been chided by professional archeologists with, "Why don't you keep notes and write up your
arrowhead hunting trips?" This could never be completely
ignored as an unreasonable request, and the following report
summarizes my initial attempt to comply with it.
The Panorama site consists of several burnt rock middens
located on a high terrace along the south shore of Lake
Austin about 18 miles west of the city of Austin (Fig. 13,
A). The location is in the Panorama Ranch development
area owned by Mr. Tom Bradfield of Austin.
The middens are at the foot of the hills that here approach
the lake shore. They lie along the edge of a small, springfed stream which flows from the nearby hills into the lake,
about 500 feet away (Fig. 1'3, B). The middens are about 50
feet above the original river. This was established from the
water level during an interval when the lake was drained.
The site, therefore, should be relatively free from river flood
damage.
The area offers what appears to be an ideal camp-site:
level meadow-land along the river, protected by hills on
three sides. The surrounding hills afford the lamellar, shelving limestone that apparently was favored for hearth stones
by the midden builders. Flint nodules of good quality are
also common throughout the area. Fuel and food from oak,
hackberry, cedar, pecan, mesquite and cottonwood trees, and
such animals as armadillos, deer, rabbits and racoons are
found over the hillsides. The stream provides fresh, clear
water and water plants; fish, turtles and mussels are numerous in the river. Food, fuel, water and shelter thus make
the area attractive as a campsite today and probably had a
similar appeal to the midden builders.

112

SURFAOE EXAMINATION
The site includes three principal middens (1, 2 and 3) and
surface indications of four others (A, B, C and D). Poorly
defined but noticeable surface indications such as flint chips
and burnt limestone fragments also occur at locations a, b,
c, d (Fig. 13, B).
Midden 1 is located at the edge of a wooded area on what
was originally a sharply sloped hill. This slope is now interrupted by a road-cut which unfortunately passes over the
heart of the deposit, destroying all but a segment. This remaining part is flush with the present land surface and does
not have any distinguishing surface features. The crosssection exposed by the road-cut is lens-shaped, about 50 feet
long and 20 inches deep at the center (Fig. 14, A). The midden, if we assume it was originally circular, appears to be
the largest of the group, about 60 to 80 feet in diameter.
Midden 2 is approximately 200 feet northwest of Midden 1,
on gently sloping ground. Destruction of this midden by the
same road is more complete than with No. 1, and the remainder has been disturbed by fence posts. This deposit
probably originally extended above ground and appears to
have had a surface of typical limestone fragments and black
earth. In its undisturbed state it closely resembled Midden
1, perhaps being slightly smaller.
Midden 3 is approximately 200 feet northwest of No. 2, on
level ground, and appears to be undisturbed (Fig. 14, B).
This deposit is a circular mound of low outline, only about
12 inches high above the surrounding land at the center and
about 36 feet in diameter. Its surface, darker than the surrounding soil, is characterized by flint chips and many
roughly rhombohedral limestone fragments 3 to 5 inches
across, some of which are burned pink, others weathered
dark gray.
Locations A, B, C and D consist of flint chips and typical
limestone fragments embedded in and lying on the surface
of the land. This evidence is confined to limited and rather
well defined areas at each location. These areas are roughly

circular or oval in outline and slightly raised above the
surrounding land. The effect suggests the tops of buried
midden deposits.
Locations a, b, c and d, and others shown in Figure 13, B
but not lettered, are simply areas where suspicious numbers
of limestone fragments and flint chips were found loose on
the surface. These locations do not have embedded stones or
mound-like structures. Possibly they are not middens at all
and may only be places where surface waters from storms
deposited debris picked up from deposits farther up-slope.
Figure 13, B shows that these locations follow the high
ground along the stream almost to the edge of the present
lake. It may be that instead of separate middens, these locations are only surface outcroppings of one very large camp
site. Evidence supporting the latter possibility was not
found but it cannot be ruled out without extensive excavation.
A surface search over all of the Panorama site resulted
in finding very few artifacts-three projectile points, six
pounders and two hand axes. The scarcity of artifacts is
probably the result of earlier activities of amateur collectors.
EXCAVATION
Excavation at this site was carried on during week ends
throughout the summer and fall of 1955. The extent of the
digging was limited to a sampling trench into Midden 3 and
a complete work-over of the remaining segment of Midden 1.
Approximately ten per cent of each of the two complete
middens was therefore examined.
More extensive digging probably would be justified, however, since this was a one-man operation and it was necessary to set fairly modest limits. The extent of the excavation was thought to be sufficient to sample the site for evaluation, without destroying it for later professional treatment if such should prove desirable.
The excavation of Midden 1 started at the surface edge of
the exposed face. The operation progressed by removing,

by hand, successive layers, each about 5 feet long, 20 inches
wide and 6 inches deep. This "shelving" was continued
vertically to a depth of about 6 inches below the bottom of
the deposit. The 5-foot sections were repeated laterally,
shuttling back and forth across the exposed face, until the
entire segment had been worked over.
At Midden 3 a small trench was dug on a north-south line
tangent to the midden. This trench was 6 feet long and 2
feet deep, extending below the bottom of the deposit. The
east wall of this trench was then "peeled" back by hand as
practiced in Midden 1. In this case the rocks were removed
from each 6-inch course and the remaining earth screened
for artifact recovery. Figure 14, B illustrates the position
of the trenches.
These excavations show Middens 1 and 3 to be similar except for artifact distribution. Each deposit apparently is
composed of approximately 30 per cent limestone fragments
and 70 per cent interstitial clay. This clay is a black, calichelike material dried into hard but friable masses. The limestone pieces are roughly rhombohedral in shape, usually
about 3 to 5 inches on an edge, and appear to be fragments
of larger slabs, generally from 1 to 2 inches thick. A considerable number of smaller pieces of limestone are found
throughout the deposits but, surprisingly, none larger. Approximately five per cent of the rock fragments are colored
pink, as by burning, on the whole or part of a face, with
occasional pieces burnt on both faces. The depth of discoloration ranges from only the surface to as much as 2 inches,
although most burnt pieces show discoloration Vz to 1 inch
deep. Both middens rest on a fairly level subsurface. In the
case of No.1 this appears to be a ledge in an otherwise sharp
slope while No. 3 conforms to the present relatively level
meadowland. In each case the subsurface soil is loose, yellow, calcareous clay liberally sprinkled with limestone fragments and pebbles. The road cut at No. 1 shows this clay
layer to be at least 6 feet thick. It appears to be barren of
artifacts, judging from an examination of the face exposed

by the road cut and screenings from the 6-inch layer under
each midden.
Scattered throughout the middens are numerous snail,
clam or mussel shells and flint chips. These items appeared
most frequently at the bottom of the deposits, occasionally
being found in clusters. A number of snail shells, punctured
by Ys inch holes, was found although never in any alignment
suggesting stringing as for ornamental use. Other than
shells the only organic material found was a small piece of
charcoal from the bottom of Midden 1 and three small unidentified bone fragments from the bottom layer of Midden3.
Several small pieces of pink ochre were recovered, about
1 x 1 x Vz inch, and one similar lump of soft white chalk.
These items could have been used for paint.
No hearths, lined pits, or potsherds were found in either
site. Midden 3, however, did provide a piece of fired clay
roughly cubical in shape, about 2 inches on an edge. Indentations, apparently finger marks, are evident on one face of
this piece. It appears to be part of a ball of clay that had
been tossed into a fire and burnt hard.
ARTIFACTS
A considerable number of artifacts was found during these
excavations. Stratification was not noted except that heavy,
crude or unfinished points were usually found on the bottom of the deposits. Probably these middens are too shallow
for any real stratification to be evident. Midden 3 was quite
barren of artifacts in the outer and central 4-foot sections of
the trench, except for a few flint chips. A similar observation could not be made for No. 1 because the central part of
the original midden was missing. Numerous points, pounders and scrapers were found in the outer 3 to 4 feet of this
midden, however, so perhaps the distribution in No. 3 was
only a vagary of the relatively small excavation. Artifacts
were, except for a few cases, free of lime encrustation although most of the poirnts showed a white patina of altered

120

Texas Archeological Society

flint. In several instances where pieces were broken this
patina was about one millimeter thick.
A considerable difference in artifact distribution between
these two middens existed, as will be evident in Table II.
The absence of pounders or manos in No. 3 and their relative
abundance in No. 1 is interesting. Not shown in the table is
a comparison of artifact density for the two mounds. The
number of artifacts found (excluding chips) per cubic foot
of excavation, was found to be 0.8 for Midden 1 and less
than 0.2 for Midden 3.
Following is a resume of the artifacts found .
Pounders or Manos:
Seventy pounding andj or grinding stones were found, all
in Midden 1. Two are limestone; six sandstone; five quartzite, and the remainder fine-grained granite. Of the total, one
quartzite and seven granite pieces show definite ground
faces. Fifteen of these are large (fist size or larger) flattened spheres (Plate 11, D) ; 16 are small (2 by % inch) flattened spheres; two are kidney-shaped (Plate 11, B), and
four are rectangular or brick-shaped. One of the latter has
four ground faces and rounded ends showing impact chipping. Eighteen may be described as egg-shaped (Plate 11,
A). Thirty-three of these pieces seem to have been discarded
while in usable condition; the remainder were broken. Four
fragments are too small for positive identification but by
their sharply curved and ground surfaces are judged to have
come from quite large manos.
All of these stones appear originally to have been water
worn pebbles; none show evidence of hafting.
Milling Stones:
Nine fragments, the largest 6 x 4 x 1 inches, of milling
stones were found. Eight were found in Midden 1 and one
in Midden 3. All fragments are siliceous limestone slabs
ranging from 1 to 2 inches thick. One piece has a flat ground
surface; the others are slightly concave; all are burnt pink
on one or both faces.

Choppers and Hand Axes:
Sixty-three flint choppers or hand axes were found: 61 in
Midden 1 and two in Midden 3. All appear to be in good
condition (Plates 11, C, E, F; 12, A, B). Probably some of
these items are scrapers; differentiation in several cases is
vague. In such instances final classification was made on the
basis of the cutting edge and weight of the tool. Workmanship on most of the axes is crude; several, however, are
nicely made. These items are core tools and usually retain
a portion of the original pebble surface. In a few instances
shiny, worn spots corresponding to finger positions are
noted. Shaping was by percussion flaking only, resulting
in oval or rounded triangular pieces.
Scrapers:
Thirty-seven items classified as scrapers were found: 35
in Midden 1 and two in Midden 3. Of these, 19 are considered circular or end scrapers (Plate 12, C, F) and 18 side
scrapers (Plate 12, D, E). All are crudely fashioned, showing only percussion flaking. Sizes range from 2 to 4 inches
in length for the circular and end scrapers, and from 2 to 6
inches in length for the side scrapers.
Knives:
Ten flint blades or fragments were found, eight in Midden
1 and two in Midden 3. Of these, four are thin rectangular
blades, 3Vz x 2 to 2Vz x 11!2 inches (Plate 12, J), four are triangular (Plate 12, G, I), and two are oval with thumb rests
(Plate 12, H). Workmanship on several of these is quite
good.
Projectile Points:
A total of 81 projectile points and fragments was found:
73 in Midden 1 and eight in Midden 3. All are flint except
one which is chalcedony. Thirty points from Midden 1 and
four from Midden 3 appear to be whole and satisfactory for
use; the remainder are crude, broken or unfinished. All
points are too large and heavy to be used as arrow heads
and must be considered as dart or spear points. Many points
seem to be finished on one side only, the reverse side being
quite crude-almost unfinished in appearance.

Miscellaneous:
Not included in the above listing of projectile points is
one long slender, tapered flint point found in the bottom of
Midden 1. This measured 6Y2 inches long, 5fs inches maximum width and 3Js inches maximum thickness. The flaking is crude percussion, and the base is slightly concave.
The extreme length and slenderness as well as some
smoothing of the edges and faces , especially on the pointed
end, make it possible that this object was an awl (Plate
13, I).
Drills: Two broken drills were found in Midden 1. Both
have round bases and most of the shaft missing (Plate
13, G).
Blanks: Five items, all from Midden 1, are tentatively
classified as projectile-point or scraper blanks. These appear to be unfinished pieces, but may actually only indicate crudity of workmanship.

CONCLU1SION
The Panorama locality conforms to Jackson's observations
(1938) for the sites in the Lake Buchanan basin: i. e., that
they are located along streams on old river terraces, usually
near the juncture of a stream and a river, and where surrounding hills offered protection from winter winds.

burnt-rock middens, is tentatively assigned, because of location and artifacts, to the pre-ceramic Edwards Plateau aspect. The preponderance of Nolan points may indicate the
Clear Fork focus.
The grinding stones show use of vegetable foods. The
generalization, however, that agriculture was not practiced
before the appearance of the bow indicates the economy
must have been based primarily on hunting. The multitude
of shells shows the importance of the river as a supplementary source of food.
These deposits were too shallow to permit much stratification. However, it is interesting to note that of a total of
278 artifacts, 207 or 75 per cent were found in the bottom
6-inch layer of the middens.
It was also noted that most of the mussel and snail shells
were found in these same bottom layers. Such concentration of artifacts and shells in the bottom of the deposits
makes it difficult to accept the method of formation customarily assigned to middens of this type, i. e. the slow accumulation of camp debris over long periods of time. No
evidence of other reasons for their existence was recognized,
however.
The author wishes to express his gratitude to Mr. Tom
Bradfield for his permission to carry out this excavation on
the Panorama Ranch and to Drs. T. N. Campbell and A. D.
Krieger of the University of Texas for their help and encouragement in this report.

AN ANALYSIS OF VAL VERDE COUNTY
CAVE MATERIAL 1
MARDITH

K.

ScHUETZ

Between the years of 1931 and 1936 the Witte Memorial
Museum of San Antonio sponsored several expeditions to
the Big Bend region of Texas. In 1933 nine shelters, designated the Shumla Caves, were investigated in the vicinity
of the junction of Milo Canyon with the Rio Grande, just
below the town of Shumla in Val Verde County.
These caves, located on the Ross Ranch, stretch from the
Milo and Pecos Canyons westward a few miles toward Langtry. In 1936 a shelter in Jacal Canyon on the I. B. Newman
Ranch was briefly investigated, and in 1936 some excavation
was done in Eagle Cave, located on the Ingram Ranch onehalf mile from Langtry.
Preliminary reports on the Shumla and Eagle Caves were
published by the Witte Museum in Big Bend Basket Maker
Papers, Nos. 1 to 4 (see Bibliography). This report is a supplement to the original ones and contains a complete study
of the sandals not previously undertaken. It also analyzes
the projectile points by formalized types recently defined by
Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954).
SANDALS
One hundred and seventy-one sandals from the Shumla
Caves were used in this study. Only a few fragments were
found in Eagle Cave, their scarcity there probably being
attributable to conditions unfavorable to preservation of
perishable material. The lower layers of Eagle Cave displayed considerable dampness, probably due to salts in limestone and ash debris (Davenport, 1938).
In addition, fires possibly obliterated the fibre layers usually found in the caves in this vicintty. Thin lines of ash
were observed between strata in some places, but were
too thin for measurement and too spotty for definite identifi1. The writer wishes to thank Charles Long and Gibbs Milliken
for photographing the artifacts.

cation (Davenport, personal communication). Since the sandal fragments are of the same construction and material as
those from the Shumla caves, their inclusion in the study
could not alter the general pattern exhibited by the Shumla
material. In addition to the 171 sandals mentioned above,
38 sandal fragments had deteriorated to the point where
they could not be used to show construction, tying method,
size or shape.
Four methods of sole construction are found among the
woven sandals (Fig. 15 and Plate 14). The first (A) is a
hi-parallel warp frame in which two strips of lechuguilla
leaf are laid parallel to one another, then doubled back into
the center of the frame at the toe end. Strips of lechuguilla
are loosely woven in a figure-eight fashion back and forth
across the frame to form the base. The sandal is then reinforced by other strips woven lengthwise into the base with
no particular pattern. This construction is represented by
51 sandals.
The second method (B) of construction is a bent frame.
Two strips of lechuguilla are laid parallel and bent together
at the toe, overlapping, to form a frame with a rounded toe.
Another strip is loosely woven back and forth to form the
base for the reinforcing weft strands. Thirty-five sandals of
this type were found.
The third construction (C) has a double frame in which
the lechuguilla strands are laid parallel to one another with
weft strands loosely woven back and forth. When completed, the sandal is simply folded in half at the toe. The
two halves axe held together by tie-strings. The number of
warp strands appears to be arbitrary and probably depended
upon the width of the foot. Two sandals with this frame
have six strips used for the base and seven, eight, nine, and
ten strips are used in the remaining four sandals. No reinforcing weft strands appear to have been used with this construction. There are six sandals of this kind.
The fourth basis of construction (D) is an opposed warp
frame. Strips of lechuguilla are laid parallel to one another

An Analysis of Val Verde County Cave Material

with the toe ends crossed and woven back and forth together
in a figure-eight fashion. Some of these sandals lack reinforcing weft strands. Six,t y-six sandals are fashioned in this
way.
Weaving of the sandals is generally crude, the weft fibres
woven in with no apparent regard for pattern except to reinforce the frame and pad the sole. Notable exceptions are
seen in seven more finely woven sandals. F'ive of them (two
of adult size, three for children) are woven of fibre, reinforced with other strands of fibre and twisted cordage (Plate
15, A, B). All are believed to be of bent frame construction;
two have bound edges. The two other examples of finer
weave are found in one complete adult sandal and part of a
child's. Their frame construction is undetermined; however, a single weft strand is tightly woven in a figure-eight
pattern across the frame to produce a fine pattern.
Materials used in the construction of woven sandals are
lechuguilla, sotol, or yucca leaves, though only the lechuguilla leaf has been referred to above.
In addition, five skin sandals were found. Other fragments of skin were perhaps remnants of sandals, but were
too incomplete for positive identification. Conditions in the
caves were perhaps not as suitable to the preservation of
skin as they were to fibre material, which may account for
the small number of skin sandals found. In each case the
skin is roughly folded into a rectangular shape and held together by tie-strings (Plate 15, C). On one sandal the overlapping skin is sewn with fine fibre cord. All appear to be
of deer skin.
Three methods of tying are used consistently in the sandals from all the caves (Fig. 16). The first method (A)
is represented by 35 sandals. The string is caught through
the sole near the ,toe, crossed, and caught through the outer
frame edges about half way back, then tied flat against the
sandal. Stringing at the sides is from the outside to the inside. In some cases only one string is used with a single
square knot under the arch of the foot; in others two strings

are used with an additional knot under the toe. In nine cases
a single string is used with one knot under toe.
The second tying method (B) is also represented by 35
sandals. One string is caught through the toe and tied with
square knots over the instep to two additional strings which
are, in turn, caught through the sides of the frame, twisted,
and tied together at the heel with a square knot. In about
half the examples side stringing is from the outside to the
inside of the frame, the other half from the inside to the outside. Two sandals show evidence of breakage and reinforcement with additional knots and heel straps, though the
stringing is essentially the same.
The third tying method (C) is represented by 34 specimens. It employs two strings knotted under the sole at the
toe, crossed on top, caught through the sides, twisted, and
tied at the heel with a square knot. Most of the examples are
strung at the sides from the inside to the outside.
Tie strings are of the same material as the sandals themselves in all examples except the more finely woven ones
described separately above.
Two children's sandals (those of the finer weave mentioned above) display an elaborate pattern of tying (Plate
15, A, B). Both employ three strings of finely twisted cordage: one string caught through the toe, the others caught
through a knot over the toe and extended high on the instep,
these being brought back and caught through the sides, then
tied at the heel.
Of the skin sandals, three used the third method of tying
(C) described above. One used a single tie string similar to
the first method described (A), but with a heel strap and
tied at the side; and the last one has a fibre-cord toe loop
with a leather thong passed through it, strung by the third
method described (C). T.wo skin sandals use leather tie
strings; the remaining three use strips of lechuguilla or
yucca leaf.
Tying methods may prove to be arbitrary, the whim of

the maker or length of the cords determining his method
of stringing. A much safer basis for working out sandal
typology is probably basic frame construction. However
many more sandals than these a t the Witte Museum must
be carefully described before a comprehensive typology can
be undertaken.
With one exception, none of the sandals is oriented for
either foot. The ex ception is the child's sandal pictured in
Plate 15, A. Toe loops on all the sandals appear in the approximate center, so we may suppose th e second or third
toe of either foot slipped into the loop.
Sandals varied from 6 inches in length by 3V2 inches in
width to 12 inches in length by 5 inches in width. Out of
109 sandals, 94 measured from 8 to 10 inches in length, which
would appear to be the adult range.
PROJECTILE POINTS
Whereas the Shumla Caves produced mostly artifacts
of basketry, Eagle Cave produced mostly flint. The first
table below shows the number of projectile points found at
the three locations. The types are among those described by
Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954).

Most of the projectile-point types tabulated above are
not illustrated in the accompanying plates because they conform closely enough to descriptions and illustrations in the
Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology. However,
where followed by a question mark there is some doubt as
to the identification, and a few of the classifications require
some clarifi~ation. Plate 16 shows projectile points which
would be included in the Langtry type, according to the
Handbook, but which the writer suspects may belong to two
or three types. Plates 17 and 18 illustrate specimens which
appear to be deviant examples of known types, and a miscellany of unclassifiable specimens.

The Abasolo classification is used in a broad sense. Of
the 197 specimens so identified, only 26 have definitely beveled blades, but some others exhibit steep chipping which
gives something of a beveled effect. The remainder fall
within the same size range of 4 to 6 em. in length and 2 to 3
em. in width, and are class.i fied as Abasolo points although
they may be small knives. The same holds true for the
Tortugas points, of which 10 of the 17 exhibH beveled edges.
A large group of points is termed "Langtry deviations" in
the table, represented in Plate 16 by specimens R-W. The
stems of this group are flared at the tips and, in addition,
are beveled, usually on the right side of each face although
occasionally on the left. Their length varies from 3.5 to 7 em.,
their width from 1.9 to 3.5 em. at ,t he shoulders. There are
over 100 of these points in the collection and they are sufficiently distinctive from "typical" Langtry points to warrant,
I feel, a new type name: Val Verde points, perhaps:
Left in the Langtry classification for now, at least, are two
other deviations. Modifications of both appear in the stem.
One terminates in a pointed stem rather than the contracted
stem with straight or concave base of the t)'lpical Langtry
(in Plate 16, compare J-N with A-I). There are 57 examples
of the pointed-stem group and 66 of the "typical" Langtry
points. Another difference between them is that the first
group has no beveling while the second has stems modified
by beveling, most frequently on the right edge of each face
but occasionally on the left.
Whether these three groups are all simply extremes of the
Langtry type, or types in their own right, is a problem to be
worked out. It should be pointed out that fineness of workmanship originally led me to place all these specimens in
one large group, distinct from all the other types.
Of the 22 Darl points identified, only four have definitely
beveled blades. Five are too fragmentary to tell much about
the blade, but 12 have beveled stems. None of the stems are
ground smooth. One specimen exhibits fine oblique chipping.

142

The usual confusion resulted between identifying Ellis and
Edgewood points, and the Marcos, Ensor, and Castroville
groups. Those assigned to one might in some cases be properly assigned to another although probably all these types
are represented.
Thirty-two points from the Val Verde County caves have
been assigned to the Palmillas type. Most of these conform
well enough to the description in the Handbook (Plate 17,
A-F), but some are deviants and may belong to other types
as yet unknown (Plate 17, L, P). These Palmillas points
vary in length from 3 to 4 em. and in width across the shoulders from 1.6 to 3 em. Fifteen of them are from Zone A in
Eagle Cave (see below).
Plate 17, Q-V shows a group of points which seem to be of
the Desmuke type. Although they resemble Abasolo points,
the lower extremity tends to have one or both edges more or
less straight before joining the convex base. One of the
specimens is chalcedony (Plate 17, T), a common material
for this type in South Texas. All seven Desmuke points are
from the Shumla Caves.
Four unclassified points of similar size are shown in Plate
17, G-J. The first is a marbled gray flint with convex blade
edges, prominent shoulders, slightly expanding stem, and
more or less straight base. Its length is 4.8 em. and maximum width 2.6 em.; it comes from the Shumla Caves.
The second, Plate 17, H, of white flint with brown marbeling, is also from Shumla. The blade edges are nearly straight,
the shoulders weak; the stem contracts slightly to a straight
base, and the blade edges are chipped rather steeply. Its
length is 4.2 em. and greatest width 2 em. The third, Plate
17, I, also from Shumla, is gray-brown flint, the blade edges
slightly convex, shoulders weak, stem edges more or less
parallel, and base slightly convex. The length is 5.1 em. and
width across the shoulders 2.3 em. The last, Plate 17, J, is a
rather finely chipped blue-gray flint from Shumla, 5.8 em.
long and 2 em. wide. It has convex blade edges, shallow
corner notches, expanding stem, and slightly convex base.

Another point from Shumla (not shown) is of grayish
flint, 6.4 em. long and 1.7 em. wide across the shoulders.
The blade edges are straight, shoulders prominent, stem
beveled on the right side of both faces and expanding, and
the base is concave.
A point from Eagle Cave, of rose and gray flint, looks
somewhat like a miniature Martindale point, but is much too
small for that type (Plate 17, K) . The shallow side notches
are beveled on the right edge of both faces.
Another point from Eagle Cave (Plate 17, M) is black
flint, its edges straight and finely serrated. Its fairly deep
side notches are thinned by beveling on both sides of both
faces. The base is concave, the stem flar.ing out into rounded
extremities. Allowing for the missing tip, its original length
was about 6 em. and maximum width is 2 em. A similar but
shorter point of pinkish flint from Shumla (Plate 17, N) has
slightly convex edges, shallow side notches and concave base.
Its length is 3 em. and shoulder width 2.1 em. The stem may
originally have been broader than the shoulders. Similar
points are found in the Rio Grande Valley down to the delta
and in northern Mexico, but so infrequently that no type has
been formulated yet (Krieger, conversation, June 5, 1956).
A small triangular point of black flint with two side
notches and three extra notches or serration~ in one edge
comes from Eagle Cave (Plate 17, 0). Its base width is 1.7
em., estimated length 2.8 em.
Plate 18, A-E, shows a group of single-notched points. A
and B are from the Shumla Caves, C to E from Eagle Cave.
It may be noted that the first three examples have the single
notch cut in from the side or corner, the last two having a
notch cut upward from the base, leaving a noticeable barb
at one corner. A, C, and D have convex bases; Band E are
almost straight. Their lengths range from 4.4 to 7.7 em.,
width from 2 to 3.6 em.
A rather freakish looking specimen is shown in Plate 18,
F. It may be nothing but a poorly made or unfinished
Langtry point.

146

Texas Archeological Society

Plate 18, G, illustrates one of five similar points from Eagle
Cave and Jacal Canyon. They have relatively narrow stems
0.9 and 1.8 em. wide, expanding into a broad midsection
with ill-defined shoulders and contracting again at the tip,
which we can only guess was point ed as all are broken. The
length is estimated to range from 6 to 7.7 em. while the
maximum width at midpoint is 2.6 to 3.8 em.
Another point from Shumla resembles the Meserve type
in that the basic shape is that of the Plainview point but the
blade edges are steeply chipped to produce a beveled effect
(Plat e 18, H). The lower and basal edges are not ground
smooth. The material is a patinated brown flint; length 5.2
em., width at base 2 em.

the proximal or handle ends are missing. I have assigned
the drills to three categories: straight, stemmed, and keyshaped. Straight drills lack a "handle" to facilitate grasping. Stemmed drills result from the reworking of stemmed
projectile points into drills. Plate 18, I, shows one with
squared shoulders, parallel-edged stem, and straight base,
while Plate 18, J, shows one with a flaring stem and recurved base. Key-shaped drills range from those with rounded, rbulb-like bases (Plate 18, K-M) to one with a circular
base and a shaft so steeply beveled on the left edge of both
faces that the plane of the shaft is diagonal to that of the
handle (Plate 18, 0). One drill with a corner tang may be
reworked from a corner-tang knife.
Knives appear in many forms from these caves, distinctions having been drawn from the base shapes. One group
has straight bases (Plate 19, D). These have straight to
convex blade edges. Their length ranges from 5.3 to 10.4 em.
and width from 3.1 to 6 em. Some of them are very thin and
well executed.
Another group of knives is characterized by rounded bases
with the bodies ranging from circular to leaf-shaped (Plate
19, C). Whereas the knives described above might be confused with large Pandora points, those of the latter group
with semicircular bases might be confused with unbeveled
Abasolo points. Their length varies from 5.3 to 9.3 em. and
width from 3.5 to 5.5 em. Many of these knives also exhibit
fine workmanship.
Three knives have bases slightly concave and somewhat
thinned, perhaps to facilitate hafting. Their approximate
length is 9 to 10 em. and width 3.2 to 4 em. The blade edges
are slightly convex and contract at the base. They resemble
Kinney points.
The category listed in the table as "heavy knives or spear
heads" displays an outline like that of the rounded-base
knife group, but these are heavy and thick, reminiscent of
the Almagre spear-point type. Their lengths vary from 4.5 to

150

Texas Archeological Society

8 em., widths from 3 to 5 em., and they may be as thick
as 2 em.
Plate 19, B, shows one of three corner-tang knives from
the caves, all incomplete.
Plate 19, A, shows one of three flake knives. It was thinned on the upper face only by removing two longitudinal
flakes, leaving a central ridge which was in turn thinned
by removing two shorter flakes. The top edge in the photograph, as well as both faces of the lower edge, had been retouched by pressure flaking.
A unique stemmed knife or lance head from Jacal Canyon (Plate 19, E) is of special interest. It comes close to, and
possibly is, a point of the Eva type described from the Eva
site in Benton County, Tennessee. This is the earliest Archaic site known in the western part of that state, having a
radiocarbon dating of 7,150
'500 years (University of
Michigan Radiocarbon Laboratory, sample M-357, mimeographed list released December 31, 1955). This knife or
point is 8.5 em. long and 4 em. wide at the shoulders.

+-

Several artifacts were found still hafted with wooden
handles. Two knives of the rounded-base group described
above still have handles. One is hafted on its side leaving
the blade edge exposed, and the other hafted at the base
leaving the point as the cutting part. One side scraper is also
hafted, and two of the Kinney points have asphaltum at the
base where this material was used to fix the haft.
An interesting scraper form is seen in the thick specimen
in Plate 19, K. One end is rounded, the other pointed, and
the under side is unworked. One edge is distinctly more
convex than the other, which is nearly straight. On the
upper face there is a high, steep bevel along the right edge
in the photograph, and the rest of the upper face is rounded
in cross-section from this bevel to the opposite edge, where
finer pressure flaking occurs. In addition to this complete
specimen, the pointed ends of two others occur in the collections. This scraper form is occasionally found in the

Edwards Plateau Aspect and is similar to a form recently
reported from Venezuela (Krieger, 1956).
Three artifacts from the Shumla Caves, which otherwise
might be identified as side scrapers, were found with fish
nets and may have been used as fish scalers. Such an interpretation was advanced by Martin (1933 b). If such was the
case, some of the artifacts I have identified as scrapers could
have been used as scalers, but they have been called "scrapers" in the absence of direct association with other fishing
impedimentia.
A plano-convex gouge of brown-gray flint, probably of
the Clear Fork type, is from the Shumla Caves (Plate 19,
F). The edges are fairly straight, the butt end rounded. The
bit end is steep and slightly convex; the bit is also slightly
convex rather than hollowed or concave.
The term "choppers" is used in the above table as a catchall for want of more exact identification of some of the artifacts. Only two exhibit a single cutting edge with the
original encrusted outer surface of the nodule remaining to
fit into the hand (Plate 19, G, H). The others are oval or
circular core tools ranging from 4 to 9 em. across (Plate 19,
I, J) . They are all thick through the middle and can be
easily grasped for, say, percussion chipping or splitting
bones for the marrow.
Of the hand axes listed, one was found in a crushed depression of the skull in a burial from Eagle Cave.

Unfortunately no stratigraphic record was kept on the
artifacts from the Shumla Caves, and today there is no way
of telling the depth or position (or even in which cave) any
particular artifact was found. The material from J acal Canyon is primarily from the surface, so we must write off the
Shumla and Jacal Canyon material in any attempt to establish a cultural sequence.
Five zones were recognized in Eagle Cave, the bottom zone
showing only questionable signs of human occupation (Dav-

154

Texas ArcheoLogicaL Society

enport, 1938). The zones were as follows: (A) limestone
dust, ashes, burnt fibre, and rock, from 1 to 18 inches deep
at the front of the shelter and from 1 to 60 inches deep at the
rear wall; (B) burnt rock and ashes, sandy layers, and rock,
18 to 48 inches deep at the entrance and 60 to 108 inches
deep at the back; (C) reddish sediment from 108 to 123
inches deep at a distance of 35 feet from the cave rear; (D)
yellow gravel123 to 141 inches deep; and (E) limestone dust
and shale 141 to 178 inches deep.
Omitting Zone E, the Eagle Cave artifacts may be tabulated as follows:

The above tables show a significant increase in the number of lithic artifacts from one zone to the next. ZoneD, the
earliest one with definite artifacts, is known by only a few
scrapers; Zone C adds a few knives and points; and Zones B
11nd A have full counts of lithic material. One would logically expect such a sequence, but whether the "jumps" or
increases are as great as they appear at first glance is open
to question because of the great number of specimens not
located by zone. The latter might cause the distribution to
be more equal.
Aside from artifacts on or near the surface, the entire
culture represented is typical of the Pecos River Focus. This
focus is not regarded as including small projectile points
supposedly used on arrows, although it is possible that the
bow and arrow was used in this area toward the end of
Pecos River Focus times. Although 60 arrow points were
found in Eagle Cave, only six have a zone identification:
four Alba points (identification not certain) and two Cliffton
points-all from Zone A. The ·p resence of these points might
be due to surface disturbance, for the cave has often pro-

vided shelter for a large number of sheep which trample
the ground. Furthermore, Mr. Davenport reports the difficulty of retrieving small objects which had a tendency to
sink through the loose layers of cave deposit as fast as one
could dig after them (conversation, July, 1956). The other
54 arrow points are probably surface finds. Thus, there may
have been a break in occupation after the accumulation of
the main cave deposit by Pecos River Focus people, the arrowpoints having been deposited on or near the surface by
a later people; or perhaps the occupation was continuous
with the arrowpoints appearing at its end. Carefully controlled excavation in the future should shed some light on
this problem.
One last observation remains: the penchant of the Zone B
occupants for beveling their dart points. The Nolan, Pandale, Darl, and "Langtry deviation" points with expanded,
curved, stem edges not only are often beveled, but together
with the Lerma and Almagre types, those in Zone B outnumber those in Zone A. However, we must again keep in
mind that the points not located by zone could balance or
change the score. This is another problem for future excavators to keep in mind.

ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN
LAMPASAS, BURNET, LLANO, AND
SAN SABA COUNTIES, TEXAS
BY

ALBERT FIELD

INTRODUCTION
As a result of reconnaissance and limited excavations over
the past five years, consideralble evidence of Indian occupation has been recorded by the author in Lampasas, Burnet,
Llano, and San Saba counties. Former campsites, mainly
rockshelters and burnt-rock middens, are abundant in these
counties and a large number of artifacts has been col1lected
from them.
In all probability, these sites were inhabited by groups
of semi-sedentary peoples who depended largely upon hunting and gathering for a livelihood. The limestone hills in
the region are covered with rather dense growths of juniper,
liveoak, sumac, and other trees which must have afforded
ideal protection for both large and small game animals.
Edible nuts of a wide variety were available, along with
black haws, persimmons, wild plums, mesquite beans, and
fruit of the cactus. The streams abounded in fish of many
kinds, and flint outcrops in the limestone formations provided a more than ample supply of material for stone artifacts. Until the recent drouths, there were many perennial
streams and springs in the area. Thus, the local environment was quite favorable for hunting and ga,t hering groups.
The numerous sites in these four counties are concentrated along the many creeks and rivers. They consist of
burnt-rock middens, which are by far the most common
type of site, rockshelters, quarry sites or chipping stations,
, and isolated features such as crevice burials, pictographs,
petroglyphs, and mortar holes. None of these sites can be
described as villages, although the deep deposits in some
of the rockshelters and the extensive midden accumulations
do suggest prolonged occupations.
To date we have located 58 sites in Lampasas County, 33
in Burnet County, eight in San Saba County, and four in

162

Texas Archeological Society

Llano County. These sites have been recorded on county
maps obtained from the State Highway Department. In this
brief report, only some of the most interesting features and
sites where limited excavations have been conducted are
described in any detail. For convenience in site recording,
Lampasas County has been abbreviated as LS and Burnet
County as BT. The sites within each county have been numbered in sequence of discovery.

NOTES ON THE TONKAWA
According to early settlers, "Lampasas" is derived from
an Indian word meaning water lilies. A large number of
mineral springs are located in and around the present-day
town, and it is reported that many Indian groups came here
to drink the waters which were thought to have medicinal
value. Stories by these early settlers mention the Tonkawa
as being the prindpal inhabitants of this section, along with
a mixture of Comanche.
My great grandfather, Dr. Feild (this was the spelling of
my mother's family name), was the first doctor to settle in
Burnet County, moving from Tennessee to Texas in the
early 1850's. He acquired a small ranch on the north Gabriel
Creek in the Joppa and Strickland communities where he
lived until his death in 1922. According to him, the Tonkawa
Indians were the principal inhabitants of the area, and they
gave the settlers considerable trouble for a number of years
by stealing horses and cattle and raiding isolated communities. Later, after becoming more or less pacified, they lived
a peaceful existence in this particular region. At one time
Dr. Feild hired a man, Mr. Cook, whose main duty was to
guard the horses at night, in order to keep the Indians from
stealing them. Mr. Cook slept at the horse corral and one
night, upon hearing a disturbance among the animals, rose
from his bed to investigate. An Indian shot him in the chest
with an arrow. On account of the arrow barbs, it could not
be pulled out and Dr. Feild had to remove it by pushing it
the rest of the way through Cook's body; however, he died
the following day.

163

As the Indians became more peaceful, they maintained a
camp on the north Gabriel Creek near the home of Dr. Feild.
I can remember him stating that he attended the birth of
several Indian babies at their camp. He also said that the
Tonkawa preferred dog meat to any other kind, and that
they were known to have practiced cannibalistic rites on
the bodies of their slain enemies. Dr. Feild mentioned having seen the Indians toss fire-heated rocks into a pool of
water in order to heat it when bathing in colder weather.
SITE LS-33
One of the most interesting sites we have recorded is
Dumas Rockshelter. This is approximately 20 miles northeast of Lampasas, in the vicinity of Izora community. The
property is under lease to Sam Shurtliff who has kindly
permitted us to investigate this area. The shelter lies at the
head of a box canyon which opens to the south. Directly
below it a perennial spring flowed until about five years ago
when the drouth struck this area.
In 1953, Edward B. Jelks and Edward H. Moorman, both
from the River Basin Surveys, National Park Service, made
a survey of the Dumas Shelter which they thought might
be an Early Man site. Extinct horse teeth, bison, deer, and
antelope bones were identified, most of these being highly
mineralized.
The ceiling of the shelter still contains pictographs made
by aboriginal inhabitants, although the majority of these
are too dim to be recognized. The most easily discernible
one is a series of five perpendicular lines painted in the
center of the shelter ceiling with a red pigment. Other
recogniz a~ble forms include a "rain cloud" symbol, an arrow
pointing southwest in the direction of the Lampasas River,
and a phallic design. The remainder of the pictographs are
just red smears that cannot be identified. Mr. C. B. Taliferro
states that he can remember seeing these drawings a number
of years ago, when they were more distinct and that one of
these appeared to represent a canoe with several Indians
in it.

In 1943-44, a dentist from Gatesville, Texas, is reported to
have found three burials in the shelter and to have excavated a number of artifacts from the fill. On top of the bluff
and adjacent to the site is a flint quarry. From this quarry
we have collected many artifacts, including knives, scrapers,
gouges, and blades.
SITE LS-56
In about 1927, Mr. C. B. Taliferro uncovered a burial in a
crevice of Indian Bluff, located about four miles west of
Lampasas, on the Henry Jones ranch. Associated with this
burial Mr. Taliferro found many hundreds of glass beads
and other artifacts, including a number of elk's teeth. His
collection from this burial and other sites is among the most
outstanding in the area, and he is quite willing to show it
to interested parties. Several years after Mr. Taliferro's
work at Indian Bluff, Mr. Eric Matthews and a group of
local Boy Scouts excavated a small shelter at the base of
the same bluff. They recovered approximately 600 artifacts
made of stone and bone. Thus, over a period of years collectors have carried away a large number of artifacts from
the Indian Bluff site.
At present, we are engaged in systematically excavating
the talus slope of one of the several small rockshelters at the
base of Indian Bluff. A number of artifacts have been found
in our excavations, including two large, well-made flint
drills. Pedernales is the most common dart point type, although Castroville and Langtry dart points have also been
identified. Typological affiliations of other points are undetermined at this time, with the exception of a small number
of Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points which have been found
in the top levels of our excavations. Indian Bluff is of special
interest because it is one of the few sites in the area that can
be assigned in part to the historic period.
SITE LS-58
At the junction of Lynch's Creek and the Colorado River
is a very large campsite along the east bank of the creek.
It lies on a terrace formed by silt deposition from both the

Archeological Investigations in Four Texas Counties

167

river and the creek. Numerous mussel shell fragments and
flint chips are scattered over the surface of this site, and
many flint artifacts have :been collected from it over a period
of years.
Approximately 300 yards from the mouth of Lynch's Creek
and on the east bank of the Colorado River, we discovered a
small rockshelter. The shelter has only a slight overhang
and lies about 75 feet above the river bank. In this shelter
we uncovered a tightly flexed burial (:Plate 20, A). With
the assistance of a group of anthropology students from the
University of Texas, the burial was completely excavated.
The skeletal remains were in a very good state of preservation as the shelter afforded some protection from rain and
other disturbances.
The skeleton had been crammed into a small, crevice-like
pit in the floor of one end of the shelter (Plate 20, B). It
was a shallow grave and the skeleton was first encountered
at only five inches below the surface. Several small boulders
were apparently placed over the burial, although there are
some indications that rocks falling from the shelter ceiling
had slightly damaged the skeleton. The skeleton is that of
an adult male, probably 60 or more years of age at the time
of death. The skull is long-headed and somewhat keelshaped with a slight ridge down the middle. The radius
and ulna of the right arm had been severely broken and
never completely healed. A few of the bones, especially toes
and fingers, were quite pitted and had an accumulation of
bony tissue about their terminal parts, suggesting that this
individual suffered from some disease. The teeth were badly
worn.
In close association with the burial, most probably as an
offering, was a small painted pebble (Plate 21, C). The
design, which consists of vertical and horizontal lines, is in
black. It is remarkably similar to a painted pebble from
Shumla Cave, Val Verde County (Martin and Woolford,
1932, Plate 4, No. 5) . No other objects were associated with
the burial; in fact the entire shelter has yielded very few
artifacts despite evidences of occupation.

168

Texas Archeological Society

The rear wall of this rockshelter contains a number of
pictographs consisting chiefly of horizontal and perpendicular lines drawn with red and black paint (Plate 21, F). A
"rain cloud" symbol is fairly clear, along with a tree-like
figure, both painted in red. These pictographs and the ones
in Dumas Shelter (LS-33) are the only ones we have found
in this area to date. No doubt there are others which remain
to be located. However, pictographs in exposed places would
fade rapidly and were probably more frequent in central
Texas than is usually thought. The dating and cultural affiliations of pictographs in this area are yet to be determined.
HlCHEY RANCH SITES
Another series of sites has been located on the Tom Richey
ranch in the western portion of Lampasas County. Mr.
Richey has been very co-operative in allowing us to survey
his property.
A number of burnt-rock middens were found in this area
and large collections made from these sites. Along the high
bluffs of the Colorado River, which forms the western boundary of Mr. Richey's ranch, evidences of occupation can be
observed in several localities. There is also an extensive
campsite on both sides of Cedar Hollow Draw. This latter
site, which extends southward along the river bank for approximately half a mile, has yielded a large surface collection of artifacts, including polished pieces of hematite with
deep striations, flint chips, and mussel shells.
At the confluence of Salt Creek and the Colorado River
lies another large campsite which covers several acres. From
this site we have made a small surface collection of pottery.
These sherds include types identified by Dr. Alex D. Krieger
as Poynor Engraved (Plate 21, E), Killough Pinched (Plate
21, D), and Bullard Brushed of the Frankston Focus. Caddoan trade pottery has been reported previously ,i n central
Texas sites; however, it is of infrequent occurrence.
From the headwaters of Salt Creek to its mouth we have
found a number of campsites, burnt-rock middens, and a
rockshelter. The rockshelter is located about one mile up-

stream from the confluence of Salt Creek and the Colorado
River, on the nol't'h bank of the creek. Directly below the
shelter is a midden partially buried in the alluVlium of Salt
Creek. Test pits dug into the floor of the shelter indicated
evidence of former occupation. Mussel shell fragments and
flint chips were found in the test pits, in association with a
few broken and complete flint artifacts. We plan to excavate
this site in the future.
SAN SABA COUNTY SITES
At the mouth of Rough Creek in San Saba County are
remains of former campsites, including several burnt-rock
middens. Rough Creek emptries into the Colorado River
about four miles above the town of Bend, Texas. From
this point upstream to the mouth of Salt Creek, there is
much evidence of aboriginal occupation and hundreds of
artifacts have been collected from these sites on both sides
of the Colorado River, and along the courses of the Salt and
Rough Creeks. Erosion of high terraces along both banks
of the Colorado River has revealed stratified layers of silt
deposition, which include mussel shells, flint chips, and
crude artifacts from various levels.
Directly below Post Oak Falls, and on the San Saba County side of the Colorado River, we conducted limited excavations in a cave situated about 50 feet above the flood plain
of the river. Although this was clearly a former campsite,
our excavations recovered very few artifacts. A few Seallorn and Perdiz arrow points were found in association with
small fragments of red ochre. The cave deposit contained
ash, charcoal, mussel shells, flint chips, and fragments of
animal bones.
Our surveys along the Colorado River, extending from the
Barnes and Vann ranches to Fall Creek, have shown this
section to be particularly rich in archeological sites. There
are numerous caves and rockshelters that should reveal important sequences of complexes, possibly even evidences of
Early Man occupation. Needless to say, a tremendous
amount of archeological work could be done on these sites

172

adjacent to the Colorado River, to say nothing of its drainages.
BUCHANAN LAKE S·I TES
At Maxwell's Cove on the Llano County side of Lake
Buchanan and about eight miles above Buchanan Dam there
is a site from which numerous artifacts have been collected.
During high water level the lake inundates the site, but a
portion of it is exposed when the water recedes. Directly
west of this locality on the southern slope of a high hill lies
a small rockshelter. Two petroglyphs have been carved on
a large sandstone boulder lying just above the talus slope.
One appears to represent a flag or banner, the other a swastika-like design. No other evidence of occupation was noted.
Fr.om a site at the base of White Bluff on Lake Buchanan
we found a tubular pipe of steatite. The pipe measures approximately seven inches in length. In association with the
pipe were a number of projectile points, scrapers, drills, and
manos. In a sandstone bluff adjacent to this site we discovered a disarticulated crevice burial. Only the arm and leg
bones were in place, and there was no trace of the skull or
teeth. Like the other sites along the shores of the lake, this
one is flooded at high water periods.
Prior to the completion of Buchanan Dam, the entire area
was shown to have once sustained a l'a rge Indian population
(Jackson, 1938). Due to a prolonged drouth in 1953, when
the lake receded to its lowest level, many of these sites were
exposed. Hearths consisting of burned sandstone and limestone extended over much of the basin and were still in situ.
Hundreds of artifacts were carried from these sites by collectors during this low water period.
GOODRICH ROCKSHELTER (BT-17)
In the early spring of 1952, while searching by bo:at for
sites along the Colorado River, we located a rockshelter on
the east bank in Burnet County. It is on the Goodrich ranch,
about 22 miles southwest of Lampasas and approximately
300 yards above old Tanyard crossing. The shelter extends

for 150 feet along the base of the limestone bluff and has an
overhanging ledge of about 10 feet in the widest section.
Flood waters from the river have covered the site a number
of times in the past, leaving a deep deposit of silt in the
shelter. At the time of discovery several test pits were dug
along the length of the shelter and all of them revealed
evidences of former occupations, such as mussel shells, bone
scrap, and chipped flint.
On the following weekend we began excavating in an area
five by seven feet, which was dug to a depth of 60 inches in
the widest part of the shelter. Many artifacts of bone, sandstone, 'a nd flint were recovered. In the upper levels were
mainly Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points, whereas below the
18-inch level we began to encounter Pedernales and other
larger projectile points. In association with the dart points
we found scrapers, blades, manos, hammerstones, bone awls,
and pieces of red ochre. Numerous polished river pebbles
were taken from the upper levels. These pebbles bear some
resemblance to those used in smoothing pottery, but, since
no pottery has been found at the Goodrich Shelter, they
must have been used for something else. They may have
once been painted such as the one found in the Lynch's
Creek Shelter (Plate 21, C), or possibly even used as boiling
stones.
\i\Tork at the shelter was continued for several week-ends
until hot weather halted operations. During the fall and
winter of 1953 we again started excavations at the site, but
nothing was attempted during 1954 or 1955. Then in January of 1956, we resumed excavations in the southern extremity of the shelter. Here at a depth of 36 inches we discovered an infant burial. Since our pit had only partially
exposed the burial and since we were inexperienced in the
proper removal of skeletal material, we called Alex D.
Krieger ,a nd Dee Ann Suhm from the Department of Anthropology, University of Texas. Together with a group
of students from the University of Texas we dug a pit,
labeled "A", on the west side of the burial (Plate 22, A) .
The upper six-inch level of this square consisted of loose

176

Texas Archeological Society

soil which contained a large amount of mussel shell fragments and flint chips, but no hearthstones. One Perdiz point
was found in this zone. From the six to 12-inch level an
increase of hearthstones was noted and many burned mussel
shell fragments were found. The 12 to 18-inch layer contained more hearthstones, with soil conditions appearing
about the same as the above levels. Flint chips were numerous and dart points began to appear. Hearthstones were
fairly common in the 18 to 24-inch zone, along with a few
flecks of charcoal. Flint chips, mussel shells and bone fragments were numerous, particularly in the lower portion
of the level.
Pit A-1, between the shelter wall and Pit A (Plate 22, B),
contained the grave of a very young infant, possibly stillborn. Faint outlines of the grave pit were encountered at
a'bout 15 inches below the surface. At 24 inches, a milling
stone of limestone (Plate 24) was found face downward
among a number of sharp-edged rocks, all within the grave
fill. At 33 inches, below these rocks, a waterworn limestone
slab painted on both faces with parallel red lines was found
(Plate 23, A-B). The skull fragments and a few other bone
fragments of the infanir were found three inches lower,
resting on a large but thin and sharp-edged limestone slab,
also painted with red. The paint was probably powdered
ochre in both cases. The second painted stone is about twothirds covered (possibly it was once entirely covered) with
red lines running in two directions. Approximately the upper half of the face shown in Pla·te 23, C, has lines running
lengthwise, while the lower part has lines running downward at an angle of about 75 degrees to the others. The reverse side bears only a few very tiny specks of red paint,
without pattern.
The infant body had evidently been placed on the painted
slab face shown in Plate 23, C, ·t he grave then partly filled
with earth and rocks, among them the painted stone shown
in Plate 23, A-B; then more earth and large rocks were
placed in the grave, including the inverted milling stone.
Finally, the pit was filled to the top (about 15 inches below

the present surface) with earth and a few small rocks. Miscellaneous debris such as charcoal, mussel shell fragments,
and flint chips were probably only incidental inclusions.
The skeletal remains from this burial consist of only a
few skull and rib fragments, and several finger bones. It
could be seen, however, that the long axis of the body was
east-west, the same direction as the longitudinal lines on
the two painted stones. The stones may therefore have had
some symbolic connection with death.
The only clue to the cultural affiliation of this burial is
the level from which the pit was dug. It has been mentioned that small arrow points were found as deep as 18
inches in other parts of the deposit; and since the grave pit
was encountered about 15 inches down, this burial is tentatively assigned to the arrow-point level-i. e., to the Central
Texas Aspect in this area.
Central Texas burials usually have no offerings, but occasionally shell, bone, or stone artifacts have been found
within graves. The Goodrich Rockshelter infant burial, however, is the first recorded case of painted stones or milling
stones having been found in graves in this area. Painted
pebbles of a small size, usually easily held in one's palm, are
most common in the Big Bend area west of Devil's River,
but some have been recorded from rockshelters along the
upper Nueces River system, and one was found in a midden
in the Lake Buchanan basin (Jackson, 1938 a, Plate 8, No.4).
Therefore the small painted pebble from the burial in the
Lynch's Creek Rockshelter discussed albove (see Plate 21,
C) was not entirely unexpected although its presence in a
grave is new to this area. The two painted stones from the
Goodrich shelter, however, are quite different from previously known "painted pebbles", being much larger and
having unique designs.
Excavations at this shelter are by no means complete. A
full excavation would be a considerable undertaking and
should be supervised by trained archeologists.

SUMMARY
Projectile points from this area are typical of those found
over much of central Texas. Among the rarer points are one
Folsom and two Clovis. The Folsom point was found on the
surface of Lynch's Creek site LS-1. One Clovis point (Plate
21, A-A') is from the surface of site B0-1 in Bl'anco County,
and the second Clovis point (Plate 21, B-B') is from a site in
western Lampasas County, near the Colorado River. At LS1, where the Folsom point was recovered, we also found an
Angostura and a Meserve point. Some classification of otiher
points has been attempted. So far we have recognized Alba,
Perdiz, Cuney, and Scallorn arrow points; and Darl, Ellis,
Edgewood, Mantell, Nolan, Pedernales, Castroville, and Williams dart point types. Other points found during our surveys remain to be identified.
Mortar holes, although not numerous in this area, have
been found along Lynch's Creek. There are 19 of them in
a sandstone ledge adjacent to site LS-1 on the Pat Jackson
ranch, and eight at site LS-46 in the Cedar Hollow region
of the Tom Riohey ranch. Burned mussel shells have been
found in some of these mortar holes, giving rise to the possibility that Indians may have used them for cooking purposes. However, this seems unlikely to the writer.
Manos are found through the entire region and are especially common in the Lake Buchanan area. Most sites in this
region contain from one to a dozen of these handstones made
from quartzite, sandstone, or limestone. A number of these
are of the edged form. It is the belief of the writer that
these manos were not always used for grinding purposes,
but rather may have been used in tanning hides. Edged
forms of the manos may have been especially well suited
:for this purpose. Milling stones are also found throughout
this section, but are not as numerous as the manos. Broken
ones are distributed over most sites. Complete milling slabs
have a basin-'Shaped depression which varies in depth, depending upon the length of time they were used. They are
usually limestone or sandstone.

Archeological Investigations in Four Texas Counties

183

Very few archeological surveys have been made in the
eastern portion of Lampasas County, but judging from reports there must be numerous campsites along the Lampasas
River and its tributaries. To date we have located only five
sites (LS-27, 28, 32, 33, 55) in this eastern section, along
Lampasas River and Sulphur Creek. A number of burials
have been reported from this area by collectors who are
interested solely in artifacts. Indiscriminate digging has uncovered some of the burials, while others have been exposed
by stream erosion and plowing.
There is a great deal of work to be done in educating collectors to the importance of proper excavation methods.
Much valuable data has been completely lost due to negligence and ignorance of correct procedure in such cases. It
is my belief that a large number of collectors would be more
willing to co-operate in assembling notes of their work if
they were taught just how this should be done. Knowing
and realizing the importance of these methods is very essential in assisting the professional archeologist to have a
clearer picture of Indian history. In the past, our methods
have been most unorthodox, but with the assistance of Dr.
Krieger and Miss Suhm, we are gradually improving our
system. Most of our finds have been from the surface, although some excavation has been attempted.
In conclusion, we would like to thank Dr. Krieger, Miss
Suhm, and the anthropology students from the University
of Texas who have given their time and talent in the removal of these burials. They have been very co-operative,
making several weekend trips from Austin to Lampasas in
order to assist us. Their help is greatly appreciated and they
deserve more than a mere "thank you".
As time goes on we hope to discover additional sites in
this area and, in a small way, contribute whatever we can

toward solving some of the questions that confront professional archeologists.

A BURIAL IN McCURTAIN COUNTY,
OKLAHOMA
SHERMAN

P.

LAWTON

The Ward's Lake site, Mc-24, is located in McCurtain
County on the old channel of Norwood Creek.
Surface village debris, scattered along about 500 feet of
slo! ing bank, proved puzzling, so three test pits were made,
two of them 5 feet square and the third 10 by 10 feet.
The dirt is disturbed by plowing to a depth of 6 to 8 inches.
Twenty-four inches below the surface is a layer of sandy
clay, in which nothing was found that suggested human
occupation. This left only the comparatively shallow area
between the plow-line and the clay foundation in which
useful materials might be found. Underground material
was sparse, so records were kept only of one-foot levels.
The first foot below the surface was designated as Level
1, and the second foot as Level 2.
In Pit 1 nothing was found except some flint chips in
Level 1.
In Pit 2, flint chips were distributed down through Level
2, but were more numerous in Level 1 by a ratio of three to
one. A substantial number of pieces of charcoal and burned
clay were found in Pit 2, with Level 1 outnumbering Level 2
by a ratio of about two to one. Some clay pieces strongly
suggest wattle plaster, although no definite impressions of
sticks are present, and the clay does not contain grass or reed
fibres. Similar clay pieces extend into Level 2 in about
equal proportion to Level 1. Consequently, the possibilit~
of a house site was examined carefully. Two potential postholes were finally eliminated as root cavities or animal burrows. Flint chips, a flake knife, one potsherd and an incomplete scraper were also found in Pit 2, Level 2.
In Pit 3 were found an extended burial, two complete
arrowheads (one in each level), a broken arrowhead, a
broken pendant, a flake-knife, numerous flint chips, some

186

"wattle-like" clay, charcoal and 30 potsherds, four of them
in Level2.

BURIAL
This proved to be the burial of a man, about 5 feet 8 inches
in height, probably in his late thirties1. The burial was on
the back, with the right shoulder slightly higher than the
left, suggesting that the grave had not been made quite wide
enough. The excavation had also been made too short to
accomodate the length of the body, so the head was upright.
The grave had been dug exactly to the point that digging
became more difficult, where the clay foundation began
(Fig. 17, A).
The bones were in a state of extreme disintegration, and
it was possible to trace the entire outline only by following calcium flecks. One portion of the right femur and
one portion of the left tibia were completely missing, possibly the result of rodents. The remaining bone fragments,
which still held some shape, had to be protected during
transportation and hardened before they could be handled.
Portions of the left humerus both radii, and both tibias and
femurs were obtained.
The skull is the most interesting feature of this burial.
The occipital portion is artificially flattened. The forehead
slopes sharply backward, beginning immediately above the
eye-sockets. This supraorbital slope does not appear to be
artificial. The whole frontal portion of the face below the
nose is set forward of a line parallel to the forehead, resulting
in marked prognathism. The mandible is dropped slightly
and offset a bit to the left. Despite this difficulty, it seems
clear that the ape-like appearance of the face is fundamental
and not due to the dropping and off-setting of the jaw. The
four remaining teeth are worn flat . The skull is dolichocephalic mongoloid.
1. Classification by Dr. Alice Brues, University of Oklahoma
School of Medicine. Gratitude is hereby expressed to Dr. Brues
for her diagnosis of the skull; to Dr. Douglas Schwartz and Dr. and
Mrs. Stephen Borhegyi for advice; and to Dr. Robert E. Bell for
general editing.

187

The slant of the forehead and general shape of the head
are highly suggestive of the San Simon skulls, which were
dominant among a non-pueblo group in the southwest from
3000 B.C. to 500 B.C. A similar skull has been found in
Texas and several in Nebraska (Brues, 1946, esp. p. 22).
There is a likeness to the so-called "Loess Man" of Nebraska.

There were no evident burial associations. The head was
oriented directly east.
Some black organic material, obtained from the area
where calcium flecks indicated toes, remains unidentified.
POTTERY
Sherds were very sparse, both on the surface and in the
earth. Only three sherds were found on the entire surface
of the site, although erosion was marked in many places.
In 200 cubic feet of dirt from Pit 3, only 30 sherds were
recovered on a quarter-inch screen.
Of these, four were on the lower level, and one might
be classed as a chunk of baked and shaped clay rather than a
definite potsherd.
The descriptions of the sherds recovered are given in

The four pieces from the lower level all have a coarse,
pitted, weathered appearance. One roughly incised sherd
is clay or sherd-tempered (Fig. 17, B) . Its design is not
unknown in Fourche Maline, Nelson and Bryan foci, and
perhaps others.
Another has a raised scollop on a slightly round rim. This
does not appear to have been applied, but was probably
achieved by pressing down the surface (Fig 17, C).
Four thin, black, polished sherds from the upper level
show diagonal, eccentric, and parallel lines as well as suggestions of concentric circles (Fig. 17, D-G) .
Two light brown, smooth, medium-thick sherds from the
upper level show greater simplicity, one having a suggestion of brushed surface (Fig. 17, H), the other having
irregularly spaced diagonal incisions (Fig. 17, I) .
Other interesting features include a medium-thick, light
brown, polished sherd with a bevel; a small, rounded sherd
with red slip which could be a pipe stem or a strap handle
fragment ; and a medium-thick, r ough-textured piece with
light red slip and thumb impressions.
PROJECTILE POINTS
Only two complete arrow points were found in Pit 3, one
on each level. They are both relatively wide and squarestemmed. Where a road-digger cut through the same area
at Red Hill, a half mile from the site, three points washed
out of the side. Two of them are almost identical with those
taken from the burial pit. A total of 86 points was recovered
from the surface and from eroded areas.

190

Texas Archeological Society

The square-stemmed form mentioned above was the second
most common point found on the surface. The most common was an unnotched form 1¥2 to 2'12 inches long and 1 to
1¥2 inches wide, with a contracting stem and rounded base.
One point shows an intentionally made torque, another a
bevel, and a third shows a rough serration. A point of
white chert had apparently been made long enough ago to
acquire a coating of iron oxide, giving it a superficial appearance of jasper.
OTHER LITHIC MATERIALS
From Pit 3, in which the burial occurred, but not associated
with it, were a brown scraper and flake knife. A relatively
large white flint flake, apparently not a knife or scraper,
was between the lower legs of the burial and a small white
flint flake was removed from the right eye socket area.
A list of materials from the site includes (measurements
in inches):
Hoe blade: 5lh by 2%, with torque, opalesque. (Another blade,
similar in size and shape, is owned by a neighborhood boy.)
Knives: 1 flake knife from Pit 2; 1 flake knife from Pit 3; 1
black elliptical, 3% by Ph; 1 jasper, 1lh by 1; 1 white flint,
slightly crescent in shape, 4¥2 by 1%; 1 brownish chert, 1%
bylh; 1 thin flint flake, roughly triangular, 2 by 2, with
secondary chipping.
Scrapers: 1 incomplete from Pit 2; 1 brown chert, 2% by 1% by
!3/4, from Pit 3; 1 brown, 3 by %; 1 black flint, thick, 2% by
1%; 1 triangular white chert, 1¥2 by 1; one broken opalesque
scraper or drill from lower level of Pit 3.
1 chert drill, narrow, triangular, convex sides and base,
1% by %.
One broken black flint polisher from the first level of Pit 3;
one broken black hornfeld polisher from the lower level of
Pit 3.
One broken ovaloid slate pendant, with two holes drilled on
each end, and some unexplained, irregularly spaced grooves
cut in one side.
One four-sided milling stone, 9 by 8lh, with a rounded grinding
area. (An elliptical sandstone milling stone from a nearby
field also has a rounded basin.)
One broken, rounded, tapering end, apparently from a celt; one
broken, beautifully polished granite celt, 2% inches wide,
with a chisel end.
Three round manos.
Hammerstones, broken points, rubbing stones.

COMMENTS
Obviously, with so few sherds and so little material from
the excavations, no real conclusions can be drawn about the
Ward's Lake site at the present time.
One complication rests in the fact that an historic Choctaw
settlement was located on the same eminence, one-half mile
to the east. A road-digger unearthed a burial about three
feet deep, of a woman, together with a celluloid comb, glass
beads and an 1859 half-dime. This gave rise to the speculation that the Ward's Lake site might be historic Choctaw.
However, the black, thin, incised pottery found at Ward's
Lake in the first level is not historic Choctaw ware. It
could fit equally well into several prehistoric horizons, and
would have been at home at Spiro. The sherds from the
lower level are also not related to any historic group. There
are no European contact materials at this site.
The burial also showed distinctly prehistoric characteristics, and the condition of the bones suggests a markedly
greater antiquity than those of the Choctaw woman. The
skull type is rare, and is not found commonly among historic
groups though it is related to the Yaqui and sometimes
crops up among the Sioux.
The mixture of materials suggests either that the site was
occupied by several different groups at different times or
that this site should be considered in a separate classification
from those now commonly used.
For example, the two dominant shapes of projectile points
are the two commonly ascribed to the McCurtain focus (Bell
and Baerreis, 1951, pp. 53-61) and some of the pottery is
similar to that complex. But none of the other usual McCurtain characteristics are present. An abundance of sherds,
the pear-shaped hornfeld hoes, the burial furniture, and the
low domiciliary mounds which seem common to McCu rtain
sites are missing. Furthermore, McCurtain milling stones
commonly have elliptical basins.

194

Texas Archeological Society

The oval pendant, the celts and some of the pottery suggest the Fourche Maline focus. But the abundant shells and
bone artifacts usually found at Fourche Maline sites are
absent at Ward's Lake. The projectile points, especially the
large ones, are like Fourche Maline in shape, but are too well
made and have too few quartzite pieces to fit that classification neatly. Typical Fourche Maline burials are flexed
and have no grave offerings.
It is, perhaps, safe only to say that the Ward's Lake site
is, at present, puzzling, and further information is needed.
Since it is planned that a dairy barn and house will be constructed on this site very soon, it is not likely that further
information will be forthcoming.

HISTORIC SURVIVAL OF THE ATLATL IN
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI REGION 1
ALEX

D.

KRIEGER

This article developed as an attempt to explain a strange
discovery in Lamar County, reported to me at the University
of Texas in May 1955 by Henry Ogden of Paris, Texas. The
object in question is the nearly complete skull of a European
hog which has a large projectile point driven nearly straight
into the top of the braincase (Plate 26, A, B).
It is fairly well known that domesticated European hogs
were first introduced into the southeastern United States
by the De Soto expedition in 1541-43. Some of these animals
escaped from time to time, or were left behind when the
expedition disintegrated during its trials west of the Mississippi, and their descendants became the wild razorbacks
whch are now game animals in certain areas. Therefore,
it would not be remarkable that Indians would occasionally
have hunted the hogs during some 300 years following the
De Soto entrada. The puzzling aspect of this discovery is
that the chipped-stone projectile point is of a size and weight
that archaeologists now commonly regard as a "dart" point,
hafted to a light spear or javelin propelled with a "spearthrower" or "atlatl"- a weapon which, except for the cases
to be cited below, has never been recorded for Indians of the
historic period in the southeastern states or any other part
of the United States. By this I mean that the atlatl was
never seen in actual use by white men, so far as written
records go, except for two instances, both of which were
near the mouth of the Mississippi River in the early 16th
century.
1. I am verv much indebted to the following persons in the
Texas Game and F ish Commission in Austin for aid: to Clyde B.
Graham for a series of photographs of the skull; to William Jennings, biologist and Assistant Director of Wild Life Restoration, for
confirming my suspicion that the skull belonged to a European
domesticated hog; to Eugene S. Walker, Director of the Division of
Wild Life Restoration; and to Ed Ferguson, Editor of Texas Game
and Fish magazine for arranging for this work.

196

Texas Archeological Society

The Eskimo on the one hand, and the Indians of central
Mexico on the other, continued to use both atlatl and bow
in historic times, and indeed still use them for certain purposes. It seems remarkable, therefore, that the atlatl should
have passed out of existence so completely in nearly the
whole of North America before the appearance of Europeans. The archeological record, however, fully bears out
the theory that once the bow was introduced (probably not
long after the time of Christ in the Southwest and Southeast), it gradually supplanted the much older atlatl-a
process completed in most areas well before the beginning
of historic times. This theory is based not only on the relative size of the stone projectile points found in stratified
excavations, but on supplementary traits such as hooks
and weights for atlatls, and on fragments of the shafts belonging to the two weapons which have been preserved in
dry caves.
Putting aside the remote possibility that some presentday enthusiast found the "dart" point in the Lamar County
skull in an archeological site, mounted it on an arrow shaft,
and slew the hog as a sporting adventure with a bow, there
are two principal alternative explanations:
1. What the archeologists call "dart;' points were not
always connected with the atlatl, but were also used (at
least occasionally) on arrows. Thus, the hog may have been
killed with bow and arrow some time after such animals
were introduced into the Southeast by De Soto, and there
would be n othing remarkable about it.

2. The point was actually hafted to a "dart" and the hog
killed with an atlatl some time after De Soto. In other
words, this weapon survived in the Lamar County area
(and perhaps elsewhere) into early historic times despite
the absence of written records t o prove it. The bow was,
of course, the principal weapon here as well as everywhere
else when Europans appeared, as any number of documentary references attest; the only question is whether or not
the atlatl survived at all as another weapon.

We will examine these possibilities below. It is interesting, but not important to the argument, that the point was
driven into the top of the brain; perhaps the animal was
shot by a hunter in a tree, or perhaps it was already wounded
and shot in the head while lying on its side. The point hardly
seems large enough to have been used on the tip of a handthrust spear.
According to Mr. Ogden, the skull was found by Lanis
Cook in January 1955. Thirty years before, a long channel
was dug for the Sulphur River for better drainage, exposing
some gravel where Aud's Creek enters this channel, onehalf mile southwest of Slabtown and 12 miles south of Paris.
He states that "When seen, the point and a small amount of
the skull were all that was exposed and they had to be
dug from the gravel. I have searched the channel and the
entire locality a great deal and have identified some of the
points found as Harrell, Pogo, Bulverde, Darl, Edgewood,
Gary, Palmillas, Wells, one Scottsbluff fragment, one possible Pandale point, and several small arrow points with
broad barbs and expanding stems, a form not shown in the
Handbook. The pottery is Maydelle Incised, Bullard
Brushed, and Bailey Engraved or Spiro Engraved".
Obviously there is a mixture of materials here and the
gravel suggests a re-deposition. None of the types mentioned is known to belong to complexes of the historic period
in northeast Texas, and I am not sure which of the artifacts
mentioned came from the gravel and which from the surrounding ground. At any rate, the locality is an archeological site and the hog skull not merely an isolated find.
The bone around the imbedded point was shattered by the
impact and the point would have fallen out were it not that
the skull is filled with a partly cemented gravel, holding
it tight. For this reason, the point has not been removed
from its position. It can be seen, however, that it is a pale
reddish-gray quartzite, a common material for both "dart"
and "arrow" points in northeast Texas, and that, with its
broad shoulders and stem contracted to a rounded base, it

is positively of the Gary type (see Newell and Krieger, 1949,
pp. 164-166 and Fig. 57; Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, p.
430 and Pl. 94). Its estimated length is at least 3 inches
(7.5 em.) and its width 1.5 inch (3.75 em.) across the
shoulders. It is thick and crudely chipped-partly because
of the material, as is common with most Gary and other
"dart" points in northeast Texas.
It may be mentioned here that all of the "Caddoan" archeological complexes or foci appear to include both "arrow" and
"dart" points but in greatly varying frequencies in the different foci. We still have much to learn about the relative
frequency of these two categories under controlled conditions in individual sites; but if the inference about "arrow"
versus "dart" points is approximately correct it is interesting
to note that in all foci of the Caddoan archeological culture
except one, the "arrows" greatly outnumber the "darts".
The exception is the McCurtain Focus, based primarily on
excavated sites in southeastern Oklahoma (Bell and Baerreis, 1951) and partly on other sites in the Red River valley
on both the Oklahoma and the Texas sides (Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks, 1954, pp. 211-216). Recent work on burials in
the Kaufman site in Red River County, Texas (Harris, 1953)
furthermore shows that the McCurtain Focus extends into
historic times. As the Aud's Creek site, from which the hog
skull comes, is not far from some McCurtain Focus components, it is interesting to note that this focus, of all those
in the Caddoan area, shows a much greater frequency of
"dart" points than "arrow" p oints.
Possibly, then, there actually was an historic survival, or
a stronger local survival, of the atlatl in the approximate
area of the McCurtain Focus than there was in surrounding
areas. We may now turn to the two historic references to
actual use of the atlatl in the Southeast.
THE NARVAEZ EXPEDITION

constructed five crude barges and attempted to make their
way around the Gulf of Mexico coast to Panuco in the
vicinity of present Tampico, Mexico. After several weeks
the barges crossed the mouth of a great river which can only
have been the Mississippi, and shortly afterward they were
cast up at different points on the shore of present Texas.
At a point which was perhaps two days travel by barge,
before reaching the Mississippi from the east, two Spaniards
who had gone ashore for water were captured by Indians,
and the remaining Spaniards held some other Indians
hostage until the two were returned. An impasse having
been reached, a battle commenced, told in the words of
Cabeza de Vaca (1906, pp. 40-41) as follows:
"Y como no nos quisiessen dar los christianos y por este
respecto nosotros no les diessemos los indios, comenzaronnos
a tirar piedras con hondas, y varas, con muestras de flecharnos, aunque en todas ellos no vimos sino tres o quatro
arcos ..."
This is translated as follows:
"And as they did not choose to give us the (two) Christians, and because we would not give them the Indians,
they began to throw stones at us with slings, and rods,
making gestures of shooting us with arrows, although
among them all we saw no more than three or four
bows ... "

As the Spanish verb tirar may mean either to throw or to
shoot, a sentence like the above need not repeat it. In other
words, the Indians began to throw stones with slings and
to shoot "rods", the latter obviously some special kind of
sticks, distinct from arrows. True arrows are implied in
the expression flecharnos, to "arrow us" or "shoot arrows
at us". While this passage is not exactly precise, that of the
historian Oviedo y Valdez, who wrote another account of
the Narvaez expedition after interviewing Cabeza de Vaca
in the court of Spain in the 1540's, is somewhat more so
though he omits any reference to slings and says that some
arrows were shot:

"... y comenzaron los indios
flechas .. .. "

a

(." ... the Indians began to

From these two accounts, it seems clear that the "rods"
were not arrows and that they were more important weapons
(at least at this time and place) than bows and arrows.
THE DE SOTO EXPEDITION
A much fuller and truly remarkable description of the
atlatl and "dart" occurs in the De Soto documents. Strangely
enough, the locality is almost the same as that in the foregoing references. After De Soto's death and the attempt
to reach Mexico overland under Luis de Moscoso had been
abandoned, the survivors returned to the Mississippi River
and built boats in which some of them eventually reached
Mexico. In July 1543, at a point only one-half league from
the river's mouth, a battle occurred which has been described
in detail by the Inoa GarcHaso de la Vega. Swanton (1938)
presents the original Spanish text and a translation which
is essentially accurate except for some changes in punctuation. I have inserted words in brackets in a few places; the
parentheses are Swanton's:
"One Spaniard was wounded by a weapon that the Castilians in the Indies call a tiradera (javelin), which we call
more accurately a bohordo because it is shot with a stock
( amiento) of wood or a cord. The Spaniards had not seen
this weapon in all the places they had visited in Florida
until that day. In Peru the Indians use it a great deal. It
is a weapon a fathom long made of a firm rush, though
spongy in the center, of which they also make arrows. They
make heads for them of deer horn, fashioned in all perfection with four points or harpoons of palm or other wood
that they have, as strong and heavy as iron. So that the
part of the arrow or dart [bohordo] made of the rush will
not be split by the barb when it hits its mark, they make
a knot where the head or harpoon joins it, and another one
at the other end, which the cross-bowmen call batalla on
their darts [virotes], where it receives the cord of the bow
or the stock with which they shoot it. The stock is of
wood two tercias long and they shoot the dart [b ohordo]
with it with extreme force, so that it has been known to
pass through a man armed with a coat of mail. The
Spaniards in Peru feared this weapon more than any other
the Indians had, for their arrows were not so terrible as
those of Florida.
"The dart [bohordo] or long arrow [tiradera] with
which they wounded our Spaniard of whom we are speaking had three barbs in the place of one, similar to the three
longest fingers of the hand. The barb in the center was
a hand-breadth longer than the two at the sides, and thus

Historic Survival of the Atlatl

203

it went through the thigh from one side to the other. The
two side barbs were lodged in the middle of the thigh
and in order to get them out it was necessary to cut away
a great deal of flesh from [make a great carnage of] the
poor Spaniard's leg, because they were harpoons [with
barbs] and not smooth points. The butchery was such
that he expired before they got his wound dressed, the
poor fellow not knowing whether to complain more of the
enemy who had wounded him or of the friends who had
hastened his death".

Varner and Varner (1951, pp. 596-598) have included
these passages in their complete translation of the Inca
Garcilaso's account of the De Soto expedition. Of the several points where their translation differs from Swanton's,
the following seem worth mentioning because they have
to do with the details of the atlatls and the missiles thrown
with them: the javelins or "darts".
(A) Where the Varners translate tiradera as "arrow",
Swanton's "javelin" and "long arrow" are undoubtedly
preferable.
(B) Where Swanton translates "They make heads for
them [the tiraderas or javelins] of deer horn, fashioned in
all perfection with four points or harpoons of palm or other
wood they have ... ", the Varners translate "As a head it
[the tiradera] bears the tip of a deer horn worked with the
utmost perfection on four sides, or a harpoon made from
palm or other available woods ... " In this case the Varners'
translation is preferable, for the Spanish has it that the
antler heads were worked on four corners or angles (de
cuatro esquinas)-certainly not on four "points", as Swanton has it. In other words, the antler heads must have been
square or rectangular in cross-section. The only other possibility is that they had four projecting barbs like harpoon
heads, but where Swanton omits the comma after "four
points", the Varners have this correct as "four sides, or a
harpoon ... ". Thus, the heads of the tiraderas or javelins
must either have had antler points worked down to a foursided shape or harpoon-like heads (with barbs?) made of
palm or "other available woods". Farther along (see E,
below), we learn that the missiles shot with the atlatl were
actually tridents, but there is no way to decide whether

204

Texas Archeological Society

anything but wooden harpoons with barbs ("not smooth")
were used on any of the three points of that particular
missile.
(C) Where Swanton gives the length of the "stock" or
throwing stick as two tercias without translating this word,
the Varners translate: "The strip is of wood two-thirds of a
yard in length ... ". From my own experience in handling
North American atlatls, both archeological and ethnological
in origin, and reading descriptions of them, I venture to
state that the majority run from about 20 to 24 inches in
length, which is agreeable with "two-thirds of a yard".
(D) Regarding the throwing implement, the amiento de
palo, o de cuerda, Swanton makes no comment, but the
Varners state in a footnote that: "An 'amiento' is a leather
strap which is customarily fastened to a javelin for the purpose of giving it more force when it is hurled and retrieving
it afterward. Since in his first reference the Inca speaks
of a 'strap' of wood or of cord, then later specifically states
that the 'amiento' is of wood, it is possible that he had in
mind something like a pliable vine or a piece of the bark of
certain types of trees. On the other hand, he could have
meant simply a strip of wood. In case of the latter, he
no doubt is picturing here the ancient atlatl .... ". We need
only add that the Inca himself said that the Spaniards had
never seen this weapon before that day in any part of
"Florida" through which they had traveled; and they recognized it as similar to the weapon which they knew and
feared so much more than the bow in Peru.
(E) According to the Swanton translation, the middle
member of the three harpoon points on the tiradera which
wounded the Spaniard was "a hand-breadth longer" than
the two at the sides; the Varners translate this as "a quarter
of a yard" longer. The original Spanish says only that the
middle member era una quarta mas largo. As the middle
"harpoon" went through the thigh while the two side members lodged within the thigh, a "hand-breadth" seems about
right.

Historic Survival of the Atlatl

205

An interesting clue is given as to the economic life of the
Indians who used the atlatl against the Spaniards. Thus,
in the events which lead up to the battle, we read in the
Varner translation as follows (p. 595):
" . . . and in the first of these canoes they beheld an
Indian very different in aspect and color from those they
had left inland, for he was as large as a Philistine and as
black as an Ethiopian. The cause of this exceptional
swarthiness in the coastal Indians is the salt water in which
they are continually fishing, for the land being very sterile,
they sustain themselves by this means. Furthermore, the
heat of the sun, which is more intense along the coast than
inland, contributes toward making them dark. Standing
in the prow of his canoe, this Indian shouted to the Castilians in a gross and pompous voice: 'Thieves, vagabonds
and loiterers who without honor or shame travel along this
coast disquieting its inhabitants, depart from this place immediately by one of the two mouths of the river, if you do
not want me to destroy you all and burn your ships ...".

Here is a definite implication that these particular people
were non-agricultural, "the land being sterile", and that
they existed largely if not entirely by fishing. I believe
that all the agricultural Indians of America had the bow
when discovered by European explorers, as well as almost
all of the non-agricultural ones. However, in this case there
may have been some connection between survival of the
atlatl and lack of agriculture.
The Inca's account also proves definitely that the De Soto
expedition managed to convey its pigs across the Mississippi
when they crossed this river and wandered in what is now
Arkansas and Louisiana; also that the pigs reproduced and
were kept by Indians. After the survivors had penetrated
as far, perhaps, as the Trinity River in Texas under Luis de
Moscoso, then returned to the Mississippi, the Inca states
(Varner translation, p. 530):
"Here at this stage, Alonso de Carmona, after telling at
length of the miseries and hardships of this journey, adds
that they came upon a sow which had been lost on their
trip out [i.e., the overland trip toward Mexico], and that
this animal had dropped thirteen pigs, all of which were
now large and marked on the ears, each with a different
mark. It must have been that the natives had distributed
these p igs among themselves and identified them with their
own particular signs, from which one may deduce that
this livestock has been preserved . . . . "

206

CONCLUSIONS
We may have been stretching things too far in attempting
to explain the hog skull from Lamar County in terms of
recorded survival of the atlatl in two localities, both near
the Mississippi River mouth, in the first half of the 16th
century. These localities are not only several hundred miles
from Lamar County, Texas, but the native cultures in the
two areas were quite different, and the "darts" or missiles
described above did not even have stone points. The last
factor probably has a geographical explanation, however,
because of the dearth of natural stone in the Mississippi
alluvial valley and delta.
The only fact that can be deduced under these circumstances is that the atlatl actually did survive in at least one
small section of the southeastern states in the 16th century.
We can, however, wonder whether it could not have survived for a time in other sections, particularly where the
earliest European explorations occurred as much as one or
two centuries later. In the Lamar County area, for example,
there is no known documentary material on the native tribes
until well into the 18th century, and even then the exact
locations are difficult to determine.
It cannot be proved, of course, that the large and heavy
projectile points commonly called "dart points", including
the Gary point found in the hog skull, were used exclusively
with missiles thrown with an atlatl; they may have been
used with powerful bows, or even on spears. On the other
hand, it does no harm to explore the possibility that atlatls
were still in use in the Lamar County area-and perhaps
other sections of the southeastern states-after European
hogs had been introduced by the De Soto expedition.

Whatever the best answer may be, the problem is
intriguing.

COMMERCIALISM IN EAST TEXAS
ANTONIO A. ANDRETTA

Since the formation of the East Texas Archeological Society several members have undertaken the task of exploring ~the extent of commercialism in our area. The findings
have been appalling when one thinks of the cultural material
being moved from this area as well as the prices paid.
It was found that along the Sabine River several routes
are followed by these "buyers", all of whom work a given
route at a given time. Buying is done mostly from Negro
farmers who have sites on their land and who, having
gained a little wdtten knowledge as well as lining their
pockets with a good deal of loose change, have become
commercial archeologists. This situation has restricted the
genuine amateur from entering at least eighty per cent of
the known surface sites in that area.

·T he society has ascertained the present prices paid for
artifacts in this area and they are as follows: Small or
medium projectile points, twenty-five cents; spear points
or large projectile points, fifty cents to one dollar. Other
artifacts range from five cents to five dollars dependent
upon ~he beauty and the collector. Scottsbluff points are
never less than five dollars and usually more. The society
has the names of these "buyers", the artifacts purchased,
and the price paid. Some of these coiJ.lectors are members
of local societies and a few are members of TAS.
South of Tyler in an area roughly corresponding to that
of the Frankston Focus, pottery, points, and other artifacts
sell for much the same; however, one can obtain surface
hunting rights for a nominal fee. Both Negro and White
hunters can also be hired. This appears to be the case in
most instances. These hired hunters are willing to poach
on anyone's land in order to recover pottery or other artifacts desired by the hirer. Small Negro communities have
become the focal points in this quest to loot East Texas of
its Indian relics. The procedure is simple. One who desires
pottery goes to a given area, depending on the kind of pottery wanted, and hires several "diggers" who know where

Commercialism in East Texas

209

to find burials and who systematically rob the graves for
capital gain. By disregarding everything except the pottery, they destroy not only the burials but the site as well.
Members of fue society visited several of these communities, and by bargaining with the "diggers", were able to note
their methods. It was found that these peopie also send
projectile points to other areas through magazine adds, for
which they receive good sums.
Before the creation of the East Texas Archeological Society many of its members indulged in such practices. Much
about these methods has been learned from them. This,
however, is not the case now. Because of the aims of the
society as set forth in the constitution, and the code of ethics
adopted by the members, we hope to eliminate such practices in the !future.
This situation does not exist in East Texas alone, of course,
but extends throughout Texas wherever archeological sites
are known to exist.
If commercialism is not curbed in the future, and its
accelerated rate not checked, many sites and areas will be
destroyed and the knowledge to be gained from them lost
forever. The saving of these sites and the passing of laws
against looting them rests entirely in the hands of those who
are scientifically interested in their preservation. We cannot afford to remain apathetic any longer.
It is my belief that a law must be adopted in Texas to
stop the wilful exploitation of our indian sites, and that only
a law which can and wi'll be enforced will suffice. Because
of the apathetic nature of the public in regard to archeological sites, only an aroused public can sponsor such a law
and its enforcement.
'T he East Texas Archeologkal Society is willing and ready
to work with any other groups, societies, and individuals to
stop the destruction and above aH to eliminate commerci:alism. Any suggestions or help will be gratefully appreciated. Letters should be addressed to the Secretary, East
Texas Archeoiogical Society, P. 0. Box 973, Tyler.

AN ARTIFACT FROM THE HIGH TERRACE
OF RED RIVER
ADOLPH HENRY WITTE

The writer has long :been interested in the archeological
problems of the Upper Red River drainage area. From time
to time gravel and sand quarries have been visited. Vertebrate fossils have been noted and archeological items sear~h­
ed for. Frank Morris has watched several quarries and assisted in Jefferson County, Oklahoma.
Following a brief description of Upper Red River geology,
the artifact shown in Plate 27 will be described.
Red River is one of 't he major streams of Texas and Oklahoma, with a drainage area in Texas alone of over 30,000
square miles. The river is formed in the southeastern corner
of the Texas Panhandle by the union of several headwater
streams. Prairie Dog Town Fork, considered the main one,
rises in the western part of Deaf Smith County, where an
elevation of 4,000 feet above sea level is found, but the watershed extends farther west into New Mexico. Pa.Io Duro
Canyon was formed by this stream in its descent from the
Texas High Plains.
Recent, Cenozoic, and Late Paleozoic geologkal formations are exposed along Upper Red River valley. In t'he
vi·c inity of Spanish Fort in Montague County, sands of
Trinity age appear, and limestones of the Lower Cretaceous
cap the escarpments. Cherts of Pennsylvanian age are exposed along the Spanish Fort high.
In keeping with Texas rivers in general, stream deposits
are found along Red River at various elevations above the
floodplain. Erosion apparently has removed most of the
oldest and highest terrace material. Thin stratified gravel
beds, ca~pping the hills, are common along tihe valley edges.
In northern Clay County and about 20 miles upstream
from Terral, Oklahoma, a specta,c ular series of uneroded
terraces can be observed. Follow the Byers, Texas, highway in the direction of Waurika, Oklahoma. Here on the

south side of Red River three stream terraces descend like
steps to the present floodplain. The upper terrace is 0.9
mile in width; the middle is by far the widest, 2.6 miles;
and tlhe lower one is 0.4 mile in width. Next is the floodplain, almost a mile in width. 'I'he sand-choked fill of this
inner valley extends to an unknown depth below the present
channel. This series of perfect terraces correlates very
closely with similar deposits in the vicinity of Terral,
Oklahoma, and elsewhere within Red River valley.
Thick aeolian deposits are wideSipread along Red River.
Dune fields, miles back from the river, are well anchored
by timber. Where cultivation has been attempted these
dormant dunes actually do not remain inactive long. East
of Terral, the lower, middle, and high terrace benches are
obscured by extensive dune topography.
As the need has arisen, gravel and sand quarries have
been opened and exploited in a considerable number of
places in the valley. Vertebrate fos,s ils of Pleistocene age
have been reported and the writer has investigated the
following: mammoth remains from the middle terrace at
Doan's Crossing in Wilbarger County, Texas; complete
lower jaw bones of a mammoth from the middle terrace
near Burkiburnett, Texas; mammoth molars f:mm the upper
terrace near Charlie, Texas; and a pair of large tusks from
the Douthitt ranch in Clay County, Texas. The last-mentioned site is in a high spot overlooking the Red River
valley and appears to be a remnant of the high terrace.
Large scraps of mammoth bone and complete teeth of fossil
horse have come from a pit near the Irving High School in
Jefferson County, Oklahoma.
THE TERRAL A:RTIFACT
Four miles east of Terral, Oklahoma, gravel deposits on
the L. C. McGinnis ranch have recently been exploited. A
small, well-intrenched stream cuts across the north rim of
the valley and descends to Red River, 3 miles away. In the
late 1860's and after, this spring-fed creek was a well known
watering and camping stop on the Chisholm Trail. On the

214

east side of this stream, stratified gravels have been quarried for a distance of % mile or more. The gravels rest on
beds of Permian sandstone and are covered by a sandy
stratum of soil that averages up to 6 feet in thickness. The
gravel beds also vary in thickness. To utilize the gravel,
the usual procedure is to strip the sandy overburden with
power machinery. The gravel is then loaded into dump
trucks by power lift.
On about January 15, 1956, C. C. Veal and Frank Morris,
both of Ryan, Oklahoma, were loading gravel in the McGinnis pit. Mr. Veal observed an unusual stone in the bottom of the excavation, in direct contact with the Permian
sandstone. He drew Mr. Morris' attention to the find. Veal
presented the artifact to Morris, and later it passed to the
writer.
From Morris we have the following data: The overburden
of soil removed from this spot was estimated at not less than
6 feet thick. The gravel stratum was also estimated at approximately 6 feet in thickness. Thus a total of 12 feet of
gravel and sand was deposited over the artifact.
The artifact (Plate 27, A, B) is double-grooved and of
light brown quartzite. 'I1his is a common artifact material
all over North Texas. This unusual stone is flattish, irregular, roughly oval in outline, and its dimensions are 2V2
by 3 inches. The shaping was done by pecking, a common
technique of prehistoric Indians for fashioning celts, boatstones, mauls, netsinkers, etc. The use of this particular
object, however, is unknown.
CONCLUSIONS
The McGinnis gravel pit definitely seems to be a remnant of the high terrace system of Red River. Until good
vertebrate fossil materials are discovered in the deposit, age
determination will have to wait. Interested archeologists
are urged to visit the site and observe the geological section
exposed in the cut banks.

SOME IMPLICATIONS OF THE CARBON-14
DATES FROM A CAVE IN COAHUILA,
MEXIC0 1
WALTER

w. TAYLOR

When I first began to work in Coahuila, back in 1937, I told
myself that, if ever any fluted points turned up in my
excavations, I would quickly cover them up and backfill
the trench. I had no desire to get into the "my-site-is-olderthan-yours" argument, principally, I suppose, because I
found myself interested in culture, not age.
Fortunately, our work in Coahuila did not put this resolve
to the test. We found sites that were fabulously rich; we
obtained masses of objects and information for cultural
studies; and nothing appeared that would indicate we were
dealing with Ancient Man. We realized, of course, that our
material was reasonably old, specifically that there were
similarities to allegedly ancient complexes from the Oregon
caves, from Lovelock and Gypsum caves, from the lithic
assemblages found on the California deserts, from the
Cochise of Arizona. But there seemed nothing that could
cause any real excitement among our elephant-hunting colleagues.
In fact, we pursued our cultural studies blissfully unencumbered by Time of any sort. There were no ceramics to
compare; there were no tree-rings to precision our sequences;
there were no raised beaches, no glacial moraines, and, of
course, no thoughts of cosmically contaminated carbon. We
could study nature and culture with no thought for Time,
except that represented by our one to two or more meters of
stratigraphy.
However, there were two small but persistent clouds that
marred this serene horizon. First, there were those pesky
similarities to ancient desert complexes. Then, there was

Anthropological Association at Santa Monica, California, on December 30th, 1956.

definite evidence, from the cave deposits themselves, that
during the time of their deposition there had been a rather
marked climatic change toward aridity. These disturbing
possibilities were sustained by the geologists who, in the adjacent regions across the Rio Grande and in the American
Southwest, had postulated two possibly pertinent periods
of aridity, both of considerable antiquity; the earlier at
about 6000 years before the present, and the later at about
4000 years ago (Albritton and Bryan, 1939; Hack, 1942).
Could it be that our cultural materials and the indicated
climatic change might be of such an age? Did we, after
all, have Ancient Man? We thought about all this, but with
the information and techniques available at that time, the
problem was largely academic. We continued our cultural
studies, happy in our wealth of strictly cultural data of
whatever age.
Then came Carbon-14. Of course, the record had to be
complete, and Time was part of that record-so we submitted a request that some of our material be run. Mention
was made of the possibility of considerable age, noting
specifically the climatic change and the possibly pertinent
geological dates. However, it seems that the authorities
did not believe in those possibilities. We were told to hold
our specimens for a later time when attention would be
focused on "more recent levels in the cultural picture." And
so we went happily back to our cultural studies.
But the damage had been done. The camel of Time had
his nose inside the tent. Carbon-14 offered possibilities
which strictly comparative methods of dating had not presented. Furthermore, if our finds were indeed old, I supposed that I had better know about it because, among other
things, the wealth of detail and the quantitative exuberance
possessed by our collections would, if of an ancient age, add
greatly to our knowledge of culture development in America.
Another request was submitted, this time to the University
of Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project Radiocarbon Laboratory. Thanks to Drs. J. B. Griffin and H. R. Crane, our
samples were accepted.

A little over a year ago, dates began to come back-and
with them the camel of Time came completely into the tent!
It seems that in Coahuila we not only have Ancient Man,
but we have what appear at this writing to be the two oldest
dated human artifacts in the Western Hemisphere.
There are 11 dates, all from site CM-68, Frightful Cave,
which is situated in the Cuatro Cienegas basin of central
Coahuila, the Mexican state which lies just south of the Big
Bend of Texas (Fig. 18). Four of these dates have been
published (Crane, 1956); the others have been provided in
correspondence. All dates are derived from human artifacts
or biofacts, the latter being human feces (Table 1).
It is seen that all dates are stratigraphically consistent
except two obtained on wood remnants from the middle
level, which are older than any date from the bottom level.
There is no evidence to indicate what caused this inconsistency, but it may be suggested that in deposits such as those
of Frightful Cave, secondary deposition would not be surprising. It should be remembered, however, that whether
or not their stratigraphic position can be accounted for, the
oldest dates were derived from artif·a cts and therefore date
artifacts.

These dates, of course, have been and are still difficult to
believe. I have gone to the Michigan radiocarbon laboratory
to ask questions. But nothing has come up to throw doubt
either on these samples or on the counting techniques. Contingent upon checking, which is being done at present in
Denmark, it appears that the dates will just have to be
accepted as they stand.
What, then, are the implications of the age and the nature
of the cultural materials from Frightful Cave? Before discussing a few of these, it will be well to give a brief description of the Coahuila environment and of the cultural
materials themselves.
The northern half of the State of Coahuila, where our
work has been concentrated, is an arid land belonging physiographically to the Sierra Madre Oriental. The western

all three levels of the site. However, it is known from its distribut ion and fr equency in this and ot her Coahuila sites that the type
is a r elatively late one. In Frightful Cave, 2 per cent came from the
bott om level, 34 per cent from the middle, and 63 p er cent from the
top level. In site CM-24, Fat Burro Cave, it was found in associat ion with stone projectile points known to have been in vogue as
late as around 1400 A. D.
** Due to the accidental inclusion of one specimen from the
b ott om level in this sample, it was possible that this date was
derived either from that one bottom-level specimen alone or from
a combination of that specimen w ith others from the middle level.
Therefore a check-run was made on a definitely m iddle-level specim en from the same sample. The result w as the date 9300 + - 400
B. P ., thus indicating that the original date was probably not influen ced by the accidentally included specimen.
portion of the area, however, exhibits a typical Basin and
Range topography with abrupt fault-block mountains and
r ather narrow alluvial basins, both trending generally northwest-southeast. Vegetrationally and climatically, except for
the higher elevations, it belongs to the Chihuahua Desert
province.
Culturally , our data reveal what I have no hesitation in
calling a variety of the generic culture of Arid America.
Recently, Jennings and Norbeck (1955) have formally named

220

Texas Archeological Society

a part of this culture the Desert Culture. With confidence,
then, I hereby extend Jennings' concept into Mexico. I
am convinced that throughout Arid America, and probably
extending into the Ozarks and possibly into the sheltered
sites and shell mounds of eastern United States, as far back
as our present data take us, there have been phrasings of
this basic culture. Characteristic of it are such traits as the
atlatl, large oval and stemmed (but not fluted) projectile
points, the grooved club, the absence of grooved axes and
celts, the metate and mano, net carrying frame and/ or conical burden basket, fiber sandals, both twined and coiled
basketry (the latter probably somewhat the later of the
two types), plaited matting, fur cloth, twisted fiber cordage,
considerable (if not primary at first) dependence upon
vegetal foods but no agriculture, migratory habits and temporary (probably seasonal) occupation of sites, and small
(probably patrilineal) socio-political groups. Within this
basic and widespread culture, the culture of Coahuila is one
of a number of already recognized variants, neither marginal
nor aberrant, but probably representing as typical' and full
an expression as has been uncovered to date.
Detailed and thorough studies of cultural relationships
have not as yet been made for our Coahuila materials, but
it is certain that they are closely related to those identified
as the Pecos River Focus in the Big Bend of Texas immediately to the north across the Rio Grande (Martin, 1933;
Pearce and Jackson, 1933; Kelley, Campbell and Lehmer,
1940, p. 24 ff.). To be sure, there are differences, for example,
of subsistence economy, of techniques of manufacture, of
proportional representation of identical or similar traits.
But these differences are not large, nor are they very
numerous in comparison to the similarities. Certainly, the
two cultural complexes are phrasings of a single basic culture, and closely related phrasings at that. What these conclusions mean in terms of chronology is difficult to say
at this moment. It is my hunch that the Pecos River Focus
cave-sites that have been excavated so far are no earlier
than Frightful Cave and probably would date a little later

than our earliest material, but this does not mean that some
earlier Pecos River Focus sites may not yet be found. From
a climatological point of view, it is very possible that the
desiccation evident in the deposits of Frightful Cave is
reflected in the erosion cycle which has been demonstrated
to lie between the Neville and Calamity formations in the
Big Bend (Albritton and Bryan, 1939, p. 1462 ff.; Kelley,
Campbell, and Lehmer, 1940, p. 131 ff.). Or it might be
better to say that this period of erosion marked the beginning
of a long period of aridity which, in fact, has not ended
today in that general area. In any event, I believe that our
Coahuila dates and the similarity of the Coahuila material
to that from the Pecos River Focus make it very probable
that the latter cultural complex has an even greater antiquity
than has been heretofore suspected (Kelley, 1947, p. 105).
I should, perhaps, say something about the amount of cultural material with which we have to work-! refer here
only to that from our dated site, Frightful Cave, of which
only about 55 per cent was excavated. The collection is
large, probably larger than any comparably old collection
in the Western Hemisphere. There are approximately 1000
artifacts from the bottom level, of which about 950 are of
fiber and wood. There are about 1600 artifacts from the
middle level, and only about 50 of these are of imperishable material. There are over 2100 artifacts from the top
level, of which more than 2000 are of so-called perishable
material.
Of course, these figures do not include what I have called
the cultural matrix and the cultural refuse (Taylor, 1948, p.
182 ff.). Our complete catalog has never been precisely
totaled, but a conservative estimate would place it in the
neighborhood of 9000 specimens. I should add that this
estimate does not include over 20,000 typed and counted
quids, the previous reporting of which has given my colleagues such a kick (Taylor, 1948, p. 172 ff.) .
In other words, we have from Frightful Cave an unusually
complete and numerous collection-especially so in view of

224

Texas ArcheoLogicaL Society

the determined age. Or perhaps it would be better to say
that, despite their age, the remains from Frightful Cave
present an opportunity to construct cultural contexts in
considerably more detail than is possible in most aboriginal
sites, even those of lesser age. From my own point of view,
this fact makes the absolute age of the deposits a somewhat
secondary factor in assessing their value.
But all is not sweetness and light. There are rather large
problems, one of which concerns the natural environment,
particularly the fauna, existing at the time of the cave's
first occupation. In the bottom level, we are presumably
dealing with a time somewhere between 8 and 10 thousand
years ago. At that time, in areas not far distant to the north,
there still lived a Pleistocene fauna including elephant,
horse, camel, tapir, ground sloth and others. However, in
Frightful Cave, out of the over 2000 identified mammal
bones, not a single one was identified as from an extinct
species. We do have animals represented which are no
longer found in Ooahuila, nor as far south, nor at as low an
elevation as the Cienegas Basin, but which nevertheless are
still extant. I refer to our specimens of bison, grizzly bear,
elk, and yellow-haired porcupine (Gilmore, 1947), and to the
land-snail Humboldtiana (Drake, 1951). The remains of
these species either disappear or diminish as the deposits
rise in the cave, thus indicating, together with similar circumstances in certain floral species, a climatic change from
cooler and more moist to warmer and drier.
But why are there no extinct forms? Elephants and other
now-extinct fauna have been found in Coahuila-and very
near Frightful Cave. Are we to assume that by about 9000
years ago the Pleistocene fauna had disappeared from northern and central Coahuila but was still living in southern
Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas? This assumption seems
to be cutting things pretty fine, but in the fa'ce of present
evidence, it also seems to be the only explanation which
will fit the facts.
The conclusion would be more worrisome if some archeologists, working in similar cultures and environments, had

PLATE 29

from the "Coahuila Complex", the two lower ones from the older
"Cienegas Complex".

Carbon-14 Dates from Coahuila, Mexico

not found the same thing, as for instance at Danger Cave
in Utah (Jennings, 1953). It may be possible that the warming and desiccating effects of the Anathermal climate upset
the already fine balance of the more arid areas before the
more humid regions were appreciably affected (Antevs,
1948) . If this was indeed the case, then it is logical to suppose that the Pleistocene fauna would have become extinct
in, or migrated away from, the most arid areas first. Also
the modern fauna would have emerged in such areas before
appearing in the still somewhat Pleistocene and still welloccupied environments of the more humid regions.
How this hypothesis jibes with the discovery of elephants
and tapir and hickory charcoal in southern Arizona (Sayles
and Antevs, 1941; Antevs, 1953; Haury, 1956) more or less
contemporary with, or even later than, the modern fauna
of Coahuila and Nevada, is difficult to say. Perhaps these
data themselves indicate that, for some reason, southern
Arizona was indeed more humid in those days than either
Coahuila or the northern Great Basin.
What about the cultural implications of our material? In
the first place, it is obvious that the culture of Frightful
Cave was, from first to last, definitely oriented toward the
use of fiber and wood rather than stone and bone. For
example, the ratio of fiber to stone artifacts in the bottom
level is roughly 16 to 1. In the top level it is 22 to 1. This
is a rather crude method of comparison, but it gives a
numerical approximation and places the emphasis where it
undoubtedly belongs. The same orientation is seen by studying projectile points and foreshafts. In the bottom level,
there are 7 pointed wood foreshafts, 8 stone projectile points,
and 2 wood foreshafts notched to receive stone points. But
percentage-wise, these 7 pointed wood foreshafts represent
64 per cent of all found at the site, while the figure for both
the stone points and the notched foreshafts is only 16 per
cent in each case. Thus it is perfectly apparent that,
although wood points and stone points were about equally
popular in bottom-level times, the emphasis on stone points
increases at the expense of wood points. But the significant

228

Texas Archeological Society

point here is, I believe, that the increase is at the expense of
wood points and that, despite this, wood points are still
present in the top level of the site. Such relationships
between the two types of points is not common in other
sites which have come to my attention.
On the other hand, despite the over-all increase of projectile points and foreshafts upward through the three levels
(a total of 17 in the bottom level, 21 in the middle, and 40
in the top), there is a very obvious shift from animal to
vegetal foods, or rather a decrease in the former and increase in the latter. Additional evidence of this shift in
subsistence emphasis is seen in the frequency and distribution of metates and manos, of edible seeds and of quids.
It is undoubted that this change is to be correlated with, and
attributed to, the changing climate, specifically the increasing aridity.
I believe these data have implications that go beyond our
local Coahuila problems. If, as I am convinced, the culture
of Coahuila is a typical example, neither aberrant nor marginal, of the widespread basic culture which (too narrowly,
perhaps) has been called the Desert Culture; and if, as the
dates suggest, it is one of the earliest representatives of that
or any other culture in North America, then what may we
say?
For one thing, there is the suggestion that the differences
in basic economy between the Folsom-Clovis "hunting emphasis" and the Desert-Cochise "gathering emphasis" may
be temporal and fundamentally environmental, rather than
strictly culture-historical. That is to say, the evidence of a
shift from animal to vegetal emphasis in the foods of Coahuila at a very early date may be indicative of other early
shifts, either toward gathering or toward hunting, within
other North American cultures due to the pressures of the
changing post-Pleistocene climate.
This further suggests that neither the Desert-type "gathering" cultures nor the High Plains-type "hunting" cultures
actually represent the earliest culture-type in western North
America. Both may be specializations which arose from

one or more preceding cultures which had different subsistence emphases, in response to strictly local conditions at,
or soon after, the end of the Pleistocene climatological conditions.
Although our Coahuila materials contain the empirical
bases for a vastly greater number of cultural, chronological,
and environmental hypotheses, I shall mention only one
more here. Heizer has said, and very understandably, that
it is difficult for him to believe that culture in the Great
Basin region continued unchanged for 10 to 11 thousand
years, as indicated by the radiocarbon dates (Heizer, 1956,
p. 53) . But after studying our materials and their dates, I
can find no alternative to believing that in Coahuila, at
least, a single culture complex did in fact exist certainly for
8000 years and probably for at least 10,000. To be sure, there
are variations from early to late. New traits appear, and
old ones disappear. Shapes change, and the popularity of
different techniques waxes and wanes. But there can be
no doubt that we are dealing with a single cultural continuum from beginning to end in the deposits of Frightful
Cave. And furthermore, when we examine the Spanish
documents, we are instantly and strongly struck with the
similarity of the cave material to the culture described for
the neighboring regions in the 16th and 17th centuries. For
example, of the archeologically discernable traits mentioned
by Alonso de Leon (1909), for the Coahuiltecan tribes before
the middle of the 17th century, 63 per cent are known to
exist in the cultural remains of Frightful Cave.
That we are indeed dealing with a cultural continuum is
fully attested by other data. One sandal type, made of the
same materials and by the identical technique, has been
found in quantity from bottom to top in the deposits, a span
of 8000 years: 89 in the bottom level, 235 in the middle, and
231 in the top. Two other sandal types are also present
throughout, although with less frequency. All forms of
twining, coiling, netting, and plaiting are found from bottom
to top, although there are sequential and significant variations in percentages of representation. In wood, to name

232

Texas Archeological Society

but a few, there are found throughout: atlatls and their
appurtenances, fire-tongs, fire-drills and fire-hearths,
grooved clubs, pegs, points and/ or awls. In stonework,
although the shapes of projectile points vary with time,
there seems to be a definite continuum in certain forms and,
even more surely, in certain characteristics such as serrating and contracting stems. Other than projectile points,
stonework exhibits the same techniques and the same basic
types of implements from first to last.
It should be unnecessary to point out that, in the case
of these particular data from Coahuila, we are talking
about a series of dates derived from the sequentially stacked
deposits of a single site. We are not dealing with seriated
sites over a range of territory. Furthermore, the dates
have been derived from artifacts and hiofacts, not from
products of non-human activity for which assumptions of
human contemporaneity have to be made. We are not
dating horizons and assuming that their artif act contents are
of the same age. We are dating artifacts and assuming that
their locus of discovery is their locus of original deposition,
or close enough to it to warrant the inference of contemporaneity. But whether this inference is valid or not, it is
still t he artifacts themselves which have been dated.

In view of all th e above discussion, it is app arent that, in
Frightful Cave and, by extension, in northern Coahuila, w e
have a well documented and remarkable inst ance of cultur al
continuity and conservatism. Coahuila evidently represents
a cultural cul-de-sac wherein w as retained, for a period of
from 8 to 10 thousand years, a culture that was in existence
at the close of the Pleistocene epoch in w estern Nor th
America.

Editor's Note: Dr. Taylor generously contributed this manuscript a few days after it was read (see Note 1) but there was no
time to prepare adequate illustrations before sending the Bulletin
to print. In addition to the four photographs reproduced as Plates
28-30, Dr. Taylor sent several photographs of typical projectile
points from northern Coahuila and Frightful Cave. However, it
was decided not to reproduce them because they would have meant
little without descriptions and frequency studies. It should be
pointed out that no examples whatever of the small projectile
points commonly called "arrow points" were found in Frightful
Cave, its occupation having presumably ended before such small
points appeared in that area; this is interesting in view of the
lowest date obtained from this cave, 1770 +- 250 years (Table I).
It should also be mentioned that the two uppermost sandals in
Plate 29 are woven in techniques common to the Pecos R iver Focus
in the Big Bend area, as shown in the article in this Bulletin by
Mardith K. Schuetz. On the other hand, what Dr. T aylor calls the
"twill-pad" type of sandal, of which two examples are shown in
the lower part of Plate 29, almost certainly belongs to a much
older period than that of the Pecos River Focus. Plate 30 is included to show what the dated "rosettes" lock like. ADK.

NEWS AND NOTES
THE 1956 ANNUAL MEETING
The 27th annual meeting of the Texas Archeological
Society was held at Baylor University in Waco on November
2nd and 3rd, with the Central Texas Arch~ological Society
as host. The business meeting was called to order by President Charlie R. Steen at 8:15 P. M. on November 2nd, at
Pat Neff Hall.
The minutes of the 1955 annual meeting were read by the
acting Secretary-Treasurer, Edward B. Jelks, 1 and were
approved by voice vote. The acting Secretary-Treasurer
then reported on the financial condition of the Society.
E. Mott Davis, chairman of the Auditing Committee,
reported that the Society's books had been examined and
found in order. The Auditing Committee recommended that
the system of bookkeeping be revised because the present
one is too cumbersome.
T. N. Campbell, chairman of the Nominating Committee,
offered the following slate of nominees, who were elected
by unanimous voice vote:
President: R. K. Harris (Dallas)
President Emeritus: Cyrus N. Ray (Abilene)
Active Vice-President: Fred Wendorf (Lubbock)

the members present that a letter of condolence be sent to
Mrs. Victor J. Smith, and that letters of appreciation be sent
to Alex D. Krieger and Dee Ann Suhm for their services to
the Society as Editor of Publications and Secretary-Treasurer, respectively.

President Steen proposed a resolution advocating the
creation of a state archeological commission, to be appointed
by the Governor and State Legislature, for the purpose of
preserving archeological sites and data, and furthering archeological research in Texas. It was moved, seconded, and
passed by voice vote that such a resolution be drafted and
presented to the Legislature.
The report of the Editor of Publications was read by the
acting Secretary-Treasurer.
The business meeting was adjourned at 9:45 P. M.
On November 3rd the program was opened at 9:00 A. M.
with welcoming remarks by President Steen and Frank H.
Watt, President of the Central Texas Archeological Society.

REPORT OF THE EDITOR
Once more I extend sincere apologies to the members of
this Society for their having to wait so long for the Bulletin.
About all I can do is hope that the contents will be interesting enough, and the editing accurate enough, so that when
your impatience has cooled a bit, you will find it worth
waiting for.
The first batch of articles went to the printer before
the end of September. After that, several weeks passed
before I realized that some of my mail was being delayed
in some strange manner for whkh there has been no
explanation. This was true only of large manila envelopes
with manuscript material or photographs; apparently they
were shunted off now and then by the postal service even
though plainly marked "FIRST CLASS." By late October
and early November I became greatly concerned and began
to check with certain authors, only to find that they had
mailed the material weeks before (up to five weeks in two
cases, three weeks in others). Fortunately nothing was
actually lost but it was a rather maddening experience.
By early December, practically all of the Bulletin had
been assembled and I waited for an obituary on Victor
Smith which had been promised in October. Inquiries to
the person involved were not answered. Finally, at the
end of December, I called on our reliable Curry Holden to
get this obituary, which he did in a matter of days. At
that time I had attended the annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association in Santa Monica and
heard three papers on the program which dealt with Mexican
archeology and seemed quite suitable for this Bulletin (we
still had unfilled space). Dr. Taylor mailed his from Mexico
City early in January and it appears herein. The other
two, dealing with fascinating new excavations at the great
La Venta site in southern Mexico by the University of
California and the National Geographic Society, could not
be cleared in time for this volume, but with luck they
may be obtained for the 1957 Bulletin.

eX!pected a.t regular illlJtervals. 'Dhe Texas Arch€ological
Society must, of course, rely entirely on voluntary labor
for editorial and aH business matters. Few members have
the "know-how" and still fewer are willing to spend the
time to do a cons·c ientious job. There are but four or five
persons doing professional archeological work in the whole
of Texas and all of them are badly overworked at all times;
hence it is only by the grim application of many, many
extra hours of work that the editing job ever gets done at
all. After leaving The University of Texas at the €nd of
June, there being no one in sight who could or would replace
me as your Editor, I reluctantly agreed to attempt to complete the 1956 Bulletin from Riverside. What with a new
job to learn, travels, conferences, professional committee
work, and the usual heavy correspondence, I should have
known better. Finally, however, the Bulletin was finished.
During the four years I have served you as Editor, one
thing has become crystal clear: if the Bulletin is to be
printed and distributed by late Fall each year, during or
soon after the annual meeting, articles should begin to flow
into the Editor's hands by April or May. This way, he can
take them gradually, check them carefully for structure,
punctuation, grammar, etc.; WTite :bhe authors for additional
data or clarifications, prepare illustrations, captions, and
bibliographies; re-type pages too messed up for the printer
to read, and all the other details, so that by the end of summer and the start of Fall semester there is not much left
except final checking. The printing firm can then set type,
proofs can be read, and the printing and binding done in
another two months-less, if all goes well.
At this point many of you will exclaim that the two former Editors of this Bulletin did manage to get the whole
job done between August and October or early November.
How they managed this I do not know and can only marvel.
Now you have a new Editor of Publications, Dr. E. Mott
Davis, who has taken my position at the University of

Report of the Editor

241

Texas. I wish him the best of luck, and especially I hope
that authors of articles for this Bulletin will help him to
get it out promptly by beginning ,t heir manuscripts early in
the year. Plan, if possible, to submit them by April, May,
and June.
The editing of any worthwhile journal is a "dog's job" if
it is done right. This Bulletin is no exception. The many
authors with whom I have dealt during these years have
largely been "amateur ,arc!heologists", and it has been
necessary, through no fault of their own, to expend a great
deal of time getting them started on the road to publishing
their work. Most of them learn rapidly and improve their
writing style with each new article. I take this opportunity
to thank them all for their cooperation and patience.
Now I would like to mention briefly some reasons for
my decision to leave the University of Texas after 17 years
there. This Bulletin is not the place to discuss personal
problems and I will try to avoid them. On the other hand,
there are certain basic matters that should be known to the
many persons interested in the future of archeology in
Texas before they can know what to do about them .
After my decision to resign became known, some of you
wrote to the President of the University, expressing indignation that I could not be given a good enough salary to
keep me there. The University has always had a serious
problem in regard to salaries because of its inadequate
budget, but I wish to state as emphatically as possible that,
in my case, salary had absolutely nothing to do with my
decision. I positively did not resign in order to get a few
hundred dollars a year more somewhere else. Rather, it
was the impossibility of carrying on any longer the work
of three or four people without any assistance, even secretarial, the lack of funds for travel or field work or equipment, and the lack of any responsibility in the affairs of my
own department, which brought about this decision. After
so many years of carrying such a load of work, professional
activities, and publication, with not the slightest hope of a
change even at the end, I simply had to reach a decision

242

Texas Archeological Society

whether to keep on proving that it could be done, or else
go somewhere else where facilities are provided as a matter
of course. The overwork and constant frustrations were
having a bad effect on my health, disposition, and hearing.
In the greater part of Texas, exclusive mainly of the
Panhandle and Trans-Pecos regions, the University of Texas
has long been regarded as the natural leader in archeological
research.
This being the case, what has the State Legislature provided the University for research in anthropology and archeology? In my first six years or so there, the total budget
for this work included one very low salary for an archeologist, one half-time student assistant, and the sum of four hundred dollars annually for all expenses, including travel, car
maintainence, equipment, photographic film and prints, materials for manuscript preparation, office supplies, postage,
etc. For one year this was increased to $800.00. But this was
considered too much money and it was reduced to $600.00,
where it has remained ever since. If one insisted on publishing one's researches, the costs had to be raised at
considerable extra time and effort.
It should be obvious that such funds can not possibly allow
anyone to work effectively in the face of the innumerable
things that need to be done in Texas archeology. Furthermore, as the only full-time research archeologist in the
State, I had to share this magnificent sum with some of the
teaching members of my department who also had research
problems, so that my share of the expense money averaged
perhaps half-that is, about $200.00 annually at first, then
about $300.00. Scores of trips were made about the State,
and into neighboring states, by paying expenses out of my
pocket. As the years passed, the only effect of all this was
that I was simply proving over and over that research in
archeology could be done without any funds to speak of.
Even when I made some last efforts to obtain a better
budget, no one in authority could offer even a tentative
promise to improve it. A person can take that sort of thing

Report of the Editor

243

just so long, then something snaps and he refuses to go on.
My own salary had been steadily increased, it is true, but
this was partly accomplished by almost eliminating the provision for one part-time student assistant!
Who is to blame for this? Basically, it is only a reflection
of the general attitude toward higher education and research
by the Texas Legislature, and the generally accepted notion
that the University of Texas is one of the richest in the
world. The administration of the University for many
years has gone to great trouble to convince the Legislatures
and the Governors that the richness of the University is a
myth, but the citizens of Texas and their elected representatives choose not to believe it. It has been shown over and
over that, on the basis of expenditures per student, the University of Texas does not rank anywhere near the leading
state universities of the country. Among the 48 states, Texas
ranks around 42nd to 44th in its expenditures per student,
and even this requires a constant fight for funds from the
Legislature.
What about "all those millions" from the oil, gas, grazing,
and real estate royalties? No matter how many times it is
repeated that only the income from the investment of these
royalties is available to the University, the public chooses to
ignore it. Furthermore, the University's income from royalties must, by law, be invested only in low-risk, low-interest
public bonds, so that the total income from all those millions
even now runs to less than five million dollars a year. Of
this sum, the main University can spend two-thirds, the other
third going to Texas A & M. In other words, out of something over 200 million that has been received in royalties,
the University of Texas realizes something like three million
that it can spend each year. The Legislature, for its part,
uses this as an excuse for holding down the State appropriations.
So here we have a state university with a present enrollment of some 19,000 students, operating on an annual budget
which would be considered impossible in almost every other

244

Texas Archeological Society

state except those in the South. This budget, with the income from investments and the State appropriation put
together, runs about 13 million dollars at present. Just for
comparison, the State of California, for example, with about
39,000 students on its seven campuses, has an annual budget
for 1957-58 of over 108 million dollars. The branch in
Riverside, with only 750 students, has a budget of four
million, nearly a third of that of the University of Texas.
Many middle-western states have comparable budgets. The
wonder of it is that the University of Texas manages to exist
at all with what the State allows it.
I hope that I have managed to convey the impression that
the officials of the University of Texas have done marvels
in maintaining their institution with wfhat funds they have
had to work with; that they have managed to carry on when
state universities in the north and west have been operating
with from four to ten times as much money on a per capita
basis. It is up to the taxpayers and their elected legislators
(and governors) .to provide their University with decent
funds. Higher education costs money and it must be fought
for. With its enormous economic resources, Texas can do
better!
The President of this Society, Charlie R. Steen, proposed
at the annual meeting in Waco that Texas should establish
a State Archeological Commission, and that members of this
Society should, when the time comes, do everything in their
power to support this proposal. I cannot urge too strongly
that this must be done if archeological studies are to advance
in your State.
Among the membership of this Society there are, I think,
about 300 residents of Texas. While this may not seem to
be a strong force-and certainly it should be increased-it

Report of the Editor

245

would surprise you to know what an effect you could have
on your elected representatives if you personally wrote to
them, insisting that they provide better appropriations for
all the State-supported universities, and incidentally for the
support of archeological research and museums. Furthermore, you all have friends that can insist on this, whether
or not they are members of this Society.
A common notion is that both State and Federal congressmen will only pay attention to thousands of requests for
action. This is not so: they need mainly to know that
some of their constituents are concerned with the support
of certain appropriations. Even 300 persons, writing them
letters, can have a very great influence. Pitch in, then,
and try to improve facilities for archeological research and
publication in your great State!

ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETIES IN TEXAS
At the present time there is a definite trend, throughout
the country, towards format·i on of local archeological societies. Although a number of these archeological groups have
existed for years and are well established, the majority of
them have come into being within the last ten years as a
result of a general increased ·i nterest in things of the past.
The local archeological societies of Texas reflect the same
desires of groups of people to gather in bands to attack
archeol·ogical problems-and have a certain amount of fun
at the same time. A few of our groups are of a quite respectable age, others are only a few months old; some are connected in some degree with a museum or other public institution, and some are completely on their own. A surprising number publish results of their work in some form.
It is the desire of the officers of the Texas Archeological
Society to encourage these societies as m uch as possible and
to aid in their formation. In the belief that the members of
the local societies would like to know of the activities of
other, similar groups, we sent a short questionnaire to each
of the archeological societies in the state. One letter went
astray and was returned and several were unanswered, but
here is a short account of each group from which an answer
was received. We hope that this attempt to spread the word
of local societies meets with a good response, and that similar summaries can be made a regular feature of the Bulletin.

A PLAINVIEW LANCE POINT(?)
In the winter of 1955-1956, a member of this Society,
Mr. E. W. Turbyfill of Palestine, brought to the University
of Texas the _specimen shown in Plate 31. Mr. Turbyfill
acquired it in 1954, but it had been found about 25 years
earlier by a Mr. Waddell in a plowed field in the bottomland
of Brushy Creek. The locality is about three or four miles
east of Frankston in Anderson County. Nothing else is
known of the circumstances of recovery or of possibly
associated artifacts.
A careful examination rules out, in my opinion, any possibility that the specimen is fraudulent. On the other hand,
it is the only such specimen I have ever seen from the
state of Texas or anywhere else. However, a letter from
Professor T. M. N. Lewis of the University of Tennessee,
dated June 26, 1956, states that "I have a photograph of a
typical unfluted Clovis point from the Birmingham, Alabama, area which measures nearly ten inches in length."
It has been my contention for some years that a Plainview
point is usually difficult-and often impossible-to distinguish from an "unfluted Clovis" point, hence it is possible
that the Anderson County specimen and the one mentioned
by Lewis are similar although the latter is even considerably
larger. Be that as it may, the Anderson County specimen has
distinct and rather well made diagonal flaking on both faces,
a feature probably never found on Clovis points, whether
fluted or unfluted.

The material is a dark brown, banded flint of a variety
not commonly found in East Texas, although it cannot be
said that it does not occur there naturally. The length is
7112 inches (about 19 em.) and width 1% inches (4.4 em).
The lower edges are well smoothed as far forward as the ink
marks. The second view (B) shows what may be a slight
bevel along the right edge from the midpoint to the tip, but
perhaps this is only somewhat steeply chipped rather than
intentionally beveled. The opposite face (A) shows no
beveling or even steep chipping.

A Plainview Lance Point (?)

In short, the specimen is "Plainview" in shape, proportions, mode of chipping, and basal smoothing; but it is about
twice as long and wide-and perhaps four or five times as
heavy-as ordinary examples of this type. It would seem
far too heavy for a projectile point in the ordinary sense, at
least in this region. More likely, it is a large lance point or
knife. If it is as old as the general Plainview horizon of
some 8,000 to 9,000 years, then the use of such a heavy point
on a lance would constitute a new trait for "Early Man."
This, however, cannot be more than suggested. Whatever
the best explanation, this and the specimen mentioned by
Professor Lewis appear to be exceedingly rare finds.
(ADK)

METRIC MEASUREMENTS
Some readers of this Bulletin may have difficulty in visualizing the size of artifacts when only metric measurements
are given. A handy rule is to figure 2V2 centimeters to the
inch (the true figure is 2.54 em. to the inch). Thus, 5 em.
equals 2 inches and 10 em. equals 4 inches for ordinary purposes. There are 10 millimeters in one centimeter and 100
centimeters in one meter.

SOME MEXICAN FIGURINE HEADS
IN TEXAS
One of the most interesting aspects of Texas archeology
is that, in spite of the fact that there was only a small amount
of actual diffusion of culture into this state from the higher
civilizations of central and southern Mexico - just what
traits and at wha,t times is still a matter of great uncertainty-it does appear that from time to time certain small
objects from Mexico were carried great distances into Texas
by Indians. Whether these objects were carried by traders
or visitors-even "explorers"-from the Mexican civilizations, or were handed along f:mm tribe to tribe among the
natives of northern Mexico and Texas as curiosi,ties, is a
question which cannot as yet be answered. In a paper entitled "Importance of the 'Gilmore Corridor' in Culture Contacts Between Middle America and the Eastern United
States," published in this Bulletin in 1948 (Volume 19, pp.
15'5-178), I discussed this matter in some detail as to routes,
chronology, and culture traits.
It must be emphasized that the mere finding of Mexican
archeological objects, or parts ,t hereof, in any part of Texas
or elsewhere, is not likely to mean anything unless it can be
ascertained that they reached such poli.nts through native
agencies. A great deal depends on whether or not they have
been found in archeological s1tes, for since the development
of modern tourist visits to Mexico, many thousands of people
have found or purchased figurines there; and it is certain
that from time to time, hunters, campers, farmers, etc., have
suddenly decided to "clean their pockets" while in the country and have thus thrown away such objects, among others.
A case in point occurred a few years ago, when Mr. and Mrs.
John Henry Ray of Vernon, in their usual methodical manner, reported to the writer that three figurine heads of obviously Mexican origin had been found in northern Texas.
They sent photographs of these heads and what information
they had acquired. I asked them to make further inquiries,
which they did, with the result that they finally located a
man who had contracted to paint a barn on a farm near

which the figurines were found. The painter recalled that
he had purchased the figurine heads while in Mexico, found
them in his pockets while working, and discarded them
nearby!
Thus every such "discovery" requires considerable sleuthing before we can be fairly sure that the objects were actually carrded by Indians to where they were found. In some
cases there is no1t much doubt even in the beginning, as exemplified by the green porphyry figurine deScribed by Carl
Chelf in this Bulletin (Volume 13, pp. 58-62, 1941). This
specimen was collected on the surface of an archeological
site on the Colorado River in Travis County! la,ter excavated
by a WPA project, which found another piece of the same
foreign stone. Another case which appears ;to be on fairly
solid ground as a native importwtion is the Xipe Totec head
reported by the John Henry Rays in this Bulletin in 1946
(Vol. 17, pp. 93-98). This was collected in 1916 near Cisco,
Eastland County, by a person hunting projectile points.
1In other cases ift seems unlikely that the object could have
been lost or thrown away at the spot by modern man, but
there may be, on the other hand, no proof that the location
was ever occupied by man. Then •t here is the case of a Mexican figurine head being found in a load of gravel dumped
at a home in Dallas, as reported by Professor Ellis W. Shuler
in the Bulletin (Vol. 4, pp. 79-80, 1932). The las1t-mentioned
specimen is shown in present Plate 32, J-K, about which,
more below.
Four additional clay heads ·are repor,t ed here for the first
time. The first is that shown in Plate 32, A-C, in front, side,
and back views. It was brought to the University of Texas,
probably in 1955, by A B. Prewitt, 1715 Piedmont, Austin,
who stated that it was found in the "Lake Buchanan area"
by his sister ahout 10 or 11 years Lefore. The only information available is tha·t she was "looking for arrowheads" when
she found it, and that this was far from any modern dwellings. This head is of considerable interest because, unlike
most such finds in Texas, it is instantly identifiable, even by

262

Texas Archeological Society

a novice. There can be no ques>tion that it is one of the classic clay figurine styles of the great Teotihuacan culture in
the Valley of Mexico. The oval face, the rounded, bare head
without ornamentation, and the high crown like a "sugar
loaf", are impossible to confuse with any Dither of the scores
of figurine styles in Mexico. Inci:dentally, it is also one of the
most popuLar styles purchased by tour·i sts at the great pyramids of Teotihuacan, and great numbers have been carried
to the United States.
I'I\he beginnings of the Teotihuacan culture have not been
determined accurately as yet, even the radiocarbon dates
therefrom being quite inconsistenlt. Neither has the end been
determined, although most authorities would purt this at not
Later than 800 A. D. because of the several cultures wh~·ch
succeeded it before the Conquest in 1521. The classic period
of Teotihuacan, to which the 'P rewi·t t figurine belongs, might
be estimated as lasting from 200 or 300 A. D. to about 600 or
700A. D.
Another clay head is shown in front and side view in
Plate 32, D-E. The following inrformation has been provided
by Dr. T. N. Oampbell of .t he University of Texas:
"The fragment was found by Everard Baker, age seven
years, near Barton Springs in Austin, in July, 1946. He
collected the specimen from the surface south of the swimming pool and near the left end of the softball grandstand.
At this locality a low masonry fence guards the bluff of a
rather steeply entrenched intermittent tributary to Barton
Creek. The figurine was picked up near this fence.
"I visited the site in company with Baker and his mother,
Mrs. Lyle Baker. Baker pointed out the approximate spot
where he collected the artifact. Most of the area was
grassed over, but in a few ungrassed areas flint flakes were
thinly scattered over the surface. No other archeological
remains were observed."

The flint flakes suggest but do not prove that this head
was associ<ated with Indian occupation. Unfortunately, such
a locaHty is constanHy exposed to large numbers of people,
greatly increasing the chances that such an artifact might
have been tossed away. On the other hand, unlike the
Prewitt head, this one is defaced and una<ttractive, is less
likely to have been purchased by a tourist, and it cannot be

identified sart;isfactorily as to the time and place of origin in
Mexico. H is not one of the "Archaic" or "Pre-Classic"
styles; neither does it seem to be as late as the Az.t ec styles
of about 1300 to 1521 A. D. Perhaps it dates somewhere in
the TeotJihuacan or Tolrtec periods, but i.t is difficult to say
more.
The two clay heads shown in Plate 32, F-G and H-I, were
first repo11ted to me in the spring of 1955 by William R. Sanford, a teacher in Pine Tree High School, Greggton, Gregg
County. They had been found by W. T. Bullock of Greggton
in the late summer of 1953. Mr. Bullock has kindly provided
the photographs. For reasons which need not be repeated
here, it was not until the £all of 1956 that direct information
could be obtained on ,tJhe place of di•s covery, and for this I
am indebted to Buddy C. Jones of Longview, a member of
this Society. In a letter dated September 3, 1956, Jones
states:
"I have finally learned the location of the site where
those heads were found. They were found on the bank of
the Sabine River north of Winona in Smith County. I went
to the site last week and found it to be located in the low
overflow bottomland of Sabine River. It is in the wild bottomland and there is about three miles of washed-out road
that one must walk to reach it (I also discovered a whisky
still near there). The site yielded nothing but a broken
mano, found upriver some distance. It does not seem evident that there are archeological remains at the site of the
heads .... However, although the site does not look promising, it does not seem logical that the heads were 'lost' by
some· person, because of the jungle-like location. They
could possibly have washed downstream, but this does not
seem true because the two heads were found close together.
The site certainly deserves more study before any conclusions can be reached."

Unfortunately, I have not had an opportunity yet to have
the two heads identified by an expert. The stylistic treatment is quite definite in bath cases, and it should be poss!ible
to determine their place and time of origin in Mexico quite
closely. The heart-shaped face of the first one (Plate 32, FG) is very common in the Teotihuaean culture on clay figurines, stone figurines, and stone masks; but it wou'l d be
best not to S'ay definitely that this style is found only in the
Teotihuacan culture. The second one (Plate 32, H-I), with

264

Texas Archeological Society

its headdress of a coil of clay making about two and a half
complete turns, expanding toward the top, and the small
:llace with narrow slits for eyes and mouth, a•lso belongs, I
believe, to the Teotihuacan culture; but as in the first case,
I hesitate to make this identification too restrictive. There
are at least :Dive subdivisions of the Teoti'huacan period, based
on changes in figurine styles (among other things), and a
guess is that these figurines belong in the latter periods (IV
or V), whereas the Prewitt head in Plate 32, A-C belongs to
period III, the "dasstic period."
Returning now to the head reported by Professor Shuler
in 1932, •r eproduced here in Plate 32, J-K, 1t wou'ld seem that
hi:s description of the material as "a hard cemented volcanic
ash" is erroneous and that it is a hard-baked clay like so
many thousands of other figurines in the native cultures of
Middle Ameri'ca. Volcanic ash may, of course, often look
like clay; I only question that the material was "cemented"
rather than simP'lY baked.
It may also be said trhat the Shuler head was not "carved"
but molded, for .t he style is certainly one of those from central Mexico which came into . existence in connection with
the invention of molds for the manufacture of figurines.
The origin of this head is undoubtedly the Teotihuacan culture, the flattish heart-shaped face and the rounded "sugarloaf" crown being typical, just as the Prewitt figurine is
typical. A<lthough the treatment of the face is somewhat
differelllt on these two heads, there are many variations
among Teotihuacan figurines. Shuler wrote that, "From
the front the impression is Mayan; from the side, Aztec,"
but more recent archeological knowledge would eliminate
both Mayan and Aztec cultures as the source. How it came
to be in a load of gravel will never be determined, although
Shuler himself pointed out that it "shows little water action

and ... likely it had been dropped on the surface by transcients [sic] passing along the Trinity [River]." He does not
identify the "transients" either as Indians or modern White
people: undoubtedly it is impossible to do so.
This brief notice does not pretend to treat the whole subject of artifacts of ancient Mexircan origin in Texas. A
thorough survey would probably reveal scores of others,
among which at least a fair portion should turn out to be of
archeological importance. Those who think they have found
objects of this kind should report them to The University of
Texas, Te:x:as Tech Museum in Lubbock, Witte Museum in
San Anton~o, or other mus·e ums in Texas.

Frontier Photographer: Stanley J. Morrow's Dakota Years, by
Wesley R. Hurt and William E. Lass. University of South Dakota
Press (Vermillion, S.D.) and University of Nebraska Press (Lincoln,
Nebr.), 1956. 135 pp., 100 photographs, maps. $4.50.
While this book is not archeological, it is of intense interest to
those many archeologists-both amateur and professional-who
maintain a lively interest in American frontier history and the
Indians of those times. A professional photographer who made
innumerable trips in search of new and interesting scenes to capture
on film, Stanley J. Morrow maintained his headquarters in Yankton,
capital of Dakota Territory, from 1868 to 1883.
Morrow's travels took him to the camps of the Dakota Sioux
bison-hunting tribes; the Mandan, Arikara, and Ponca agricultural
Indians; and the Bannock, Cheyenne, Assiniboine, and Crow in the
Yellowstone River country. This book reproduces scores of his
excellent and remarkably clear photographs of chiefs of these
tribes, their wives and families, frontier towns, forts, Black Hills
mining camps, and the great Missouri flood of 1881.
Authors Hurt and Lass have interwoven these pictures with a
smoothly written text drawing together many historical facts on
this exciting chapter in the history of the western Plains, together
with excerpts from Morrow's personal journal. This is a book
which every student of frontier life and contemporary Indians will
want to own.

Hill of the Rooster, by Curry Holden. Henry Holt and Company,
New York, 1956. 319 pp., map. $3.95.
Dr. Holden has been a member of this society since its beginnings.
He has been its president, editor, and a constant advisor. A professor of history and director of the splendid museum at Texas
Tech College, he has already won fame as a writer of frontier history, archeologist, and ethnologist. Now he has produced a novel
of tremendous impact, choosing as his subject the f inal struggles
between the Mexican army and the mountain Yaquis of southern
Sonora.
This stirring story has a profound message in these days of so
much talk about human rights and freedom, of brave resistance to
aggression, from which the struggles of American Indians for their
homelands are so often considered somehow exempt. To quote from
the jacket:
"A story of great love has always had an appeal that sets it free
of time and place. And there has always been a profound reaffirmation in a story of great courage and human dignity in the face of
insurmountable odds. HILL OF THE ROOSTER is both. It will
win a large following for Curry Holden, and it will be read everywhere with affection and something close to tears.
"Teta and Chepa are two strong, beautiful young people. They
were children together. Together they watched their mothers
hanged by the Mexican, and together they vowed revenge . . . .

They love violently, and together they lead their people into unequal
battle against the oppressor.
"Curry Holden calls up that love, that battle, with a unique
sweetness of storytelling, a classic purity and simplicity of style, a
heartfelt understanding of his characters, and a total familiarity
with a way of life that the oppressor finally destroyed."
The story is concerned not only with the love of Teta and Chepa
for one another, but with the fierce love of the mountain Yaquis
for their land, their unity of purpose in refusing to bow to what
they consider an alien government, their obedience to and respect
for their leaders, and the many devices they developed for survival
and anticipation of their enemy's maneuvers. I was particularly
impressed by the scene in which the Yaquis, led by General
Caumea, met with Mexican army officers and high officials to discuss peace. In the face of offers from the government for full
amnesty to all fighting Yaquis, a life pension for General Caumea,
five acres of land for each man, irrigation works, schools, churches,
etc., the general answers with calm dignity that such offers are
completely unacceptable because neither Spain nor Mexico ever
owned the Yaqui lands in the first place. Furthermore, the Yaquis
would only become fat and lazy as wards of the government.
Caumea proposes, instead, that the government remove all forts,
soldiers, and settlers from Yaqui land, together with railroads, telegraph and telephone lines. "Under such conditions," he says, "we
could enjoy our most precious possessions, our land and our freedom".
The valley Yaquis gradually accepted these offers and were regarded with disdain as yoricoyotes by the mountain people. The
latter, led by Teta and Chepa, continue the fight until finally
trapped and destroyed, as they had known would be their fate
sooner or later.
In addition to a fast pace and dialogue so masterfully written that
the reader never loses interest for an instant, one is impressed with
the author's intimate knowledge of the culture, mentality, strategy,
and logistics of both the Yaqui and the Mexican. The book also
brought back to me memories of a trip by horse across the northern
part of mountain Yaqui country in 1933. I was 21 and as yet had
no suspicion that within three years I would be embarking on a
career in archeology.

Cueva de la Candelaria, by Luis Aveleyra Arroyo de Anda,
Manuel Maldonado-Koerdell, and Pablo Martinez Del Rio. Volume I. Memorias del Institute Nacional de Antropologia e Historia,

Readers of this Bulletin will recall that in Volume 24 (1953), we
published "A Preliminary Report on the Mortuary Cave of Candelaria, Coahuila, Mexico," by Professor Martinez Del Rio, together
with 39 photographs of the site and some outstanding artifacts. I
trust that the preliminary report on this fabulously rich cave with
its great array of perfectly preserved objects of vegetal material

268

Texas Archeological Society

whetted the appetite of all archeologists. Now the first of two large
volumes on this cave has been published and may be ordered from
the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Cordoba No. 73,
Mexico City. Although the price is high, a great- deal of expense
went into preparation of this volume and it marks a milestone in the
detailed treatment of archeological material from a desert area.
Whether or not you can read Spanish is of little consequence in this
case because of the very abundant illustrations, and the fact that
the English report published in this Bulletin serves as a guide to the
general situation.
Because of the large page size, 8% by 12 inches, it was possible
to reproduce scores of the finest specimens full size. Of special
interest to archeologists in the Southwest and Texas are the numerous photographs of projectile points and of hafted knives- the lat ter
with handles both round and wide and flat in cross-section, many
decorated with incised designs. These artifacts give a good deal
of insight into the ever-puzzling question of how to distinguish
unnotched or shoulderless projectile points from knife bla des.
Aveleyra, in his sections, has also included a large amount of comparative data on the occurrences of similar artifacts in the western
United States and Mexico.
Equally intriguing are such other classes of artifacts as: small,
curved end scrapers with stems, some hafted, which may have been
used to hollow out gourds (parts of gourd vessels and two complete,
decorated ones were also found and distributions of gourd species
are discussed on pages 190-193); awls, punches, and scrapers of
bone and antler; "ceremonial" sets of deer antlers (perhaps they
were used by hunters for stalking deer?); innumerable beads of
bone, shell, and stone, many on their original strings and alternated
in attractive designs; shell pendants; "flowers" (perhaps rattles?)
made of shell or bone beads bound into clust ers; shafts and foreshafts of both darts and arrows; bows (several complete); pieces of
atlatls; curved "throwing sticks" or "rabbit clubs" with incised
lines; digging sticks; simple back-cradles or baby carriers of sticks
crossing an oval frame; and so on.
One must remember that other classes of material will be described in Volume II, namely: the incredible textiles, found in huge
amounts and woven with very intricate designs; sandals, mats, and
baskets; the human skeletal remains; bone pathology ; and dentition.
Candelaria Cave was never actually occupied by Indians, for the
problem of getting into it was much too form idable. When Walt
Taylor, Ed Jelks, and I visited the Mexican archeological camp there
in the spring of 1954, a winch had been set up over the mouth, only
about a yard across, and men were let down on a rope ladder some
35 f eet long, doubly secured by a rope payed out from the winch.
The "floor" consisted of several huge, sharp-edged rocks. The
"ceiling" also consisted of very large, angular rocks hanging
together by their corners-altogether a most dangerous place to poke
around in. It was first thought that the Indians merely dropped
burial bundles and offerings through the sma ll mouth and that
these split open on hitting the rocks below ; but after the loose
material had been collected it was seen that burial bundles and
numerous offerings had been laid away very carefully in crevices
where they could not have fallen. How the Indians managed to

Book Reviews

269

get into the cavern remains a mystery for not a scrap of rope was
found heavy enough to hold a man, nor any sign of wood for even
part of a ladder.
The age of the cave material remains in doubt although it almost
certainly belongs within the Christian era. Only two pieces of
pottery were found, and contrary. to the authors, I do not feel that
this pottery belongs near the colonial period-that is, in the 17th
century. Neither were these people agricultural as far as can be
seen, for the gourds need not have been grown locally. If, then, the
Indians who used the cave for mortuary purposes were essentially
both non-agricultural and non-pottery-making, it is rather marvelous to behold the high degree of workmanship and aesthetic quality
of the things they made in this desert environment.
