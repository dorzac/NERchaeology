LIDAR Imagery and Geologic Mapping in
Louisiana and Similar Humid-Subtropical
and Coastal-Plain Regions
Richard P. McCulloh and Paul V. Heinrich

Introduction
The landscape of Louisiana presents a particular suite of difficulties
to the conduct of the field work essential to geologic mapping. Some
of these are difficulties that affect areas across much of the U.S., e.g.,
the problems of access generally that have increased over the last
several decades owing to (1) partitioning of land into ever smaller
parcels with different owners via multiple heirs to successions, (2)
control of access to larger areas by timber companies and hunting
clubs, and (3) overprinting of the natural terrain by encroaching
development in urbanizing areas. Other difficulties that derive from
Louisiana’s coastal-plain setting and humid-subtropical climate
comprise widespread and locally thick (>6.6 ft or 2 m) surficial
deposits, extensive soil development, and dense vegetation, such
that exposures tend to be scarce, and those that do occur tend to be
ephemeral (Figure 1). Although road cuts probably are the most common exposures in the state, Harold V. Andersen, who accumulated
nearly a half century of geologic-mapping experience in Louisiana,
observed that “almost all outcrops along highways are ephemeral”
(Andersen, 1993, p. 63).
As a result of the obscuring effects of these intrinsic aspects of climate
and geologic setting, aerial photography, which has been a standard
tool for geologic mapping generally since the 1930s, is of very limited
use to geologic-mapping efforts in this setting. The same obscuring
effects limit the effectiveness for geologic mapping of many newer
satellite-borne remote-sensing techniques as well.
Since the late 1990s, the LIDAR imagery increasingly available for
parts of Louisiana has developed into the basis of a new and more
effective remote-sensing tool for geologic-mapping applications.
The vertical instrumental precision of these LIDAR-based digital
elevation models (DEMs) is listed in the metadata as 0.01 ft (0.003
m); their effective vertical precision following corrections for vegetation is approximately 0.1 ft (0.03 m) according to 3001, Inc. (New
Orleans), which flew the LIDAR. In low-relief coastal-plain regions,

wherever access restrictions create a need to project geologic map
units from adjacent areas that have yielded more ground truth, imagery with such vertical detail generally permits much more confident
projection and interpolation than older kinds of imagery. In Louisiana
specifically, such increased precision in the perception of geomorphic
attributes has great utility because (1) Pliocene and Quaternary strata
here show progressive incision of older units by younger units, and
(2) in south Louisiana at least, reactivated surface faults, many with
small surface displacements (≤6.6 ft or 2 m) scarcely perceptible on
standard U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangles with a
contour interval of 5 ft (1.5 m), show up with unprecedented clarity
at effective vertical resolutions of less than 1 ft (0.3 m).

Examples
Figures 2–5 offer comparisons for several 7.5-minute quarter-quadrangle areas of views of standard DEMs and LIDAR DEMs, with the
LIDAR permitting increased discrimination of fine terrain detail,
some of which is pertinent to recognition criteria for surface-geologic
mapping tasks.
Clearly, this enhanced topographic (and hence geomorphic) detail
afforded by LIDAR imagery relative to standard 7.5-minute topography in the figured areas enables a more-detailed interpretation and
delineation of the surface geology than was possible before. LIDAR
imagery is extremely useful in geologic mapping of the Quaternary
units predominant in Louisiana because it provides a detailed and
uniform view of the morphology of their surfaces. As a result, it is
relatively easy to observe and compare the degree of degradation of
the construction landforms, i.e., natural levees, relict channels, beach
ridges, ridge-and-swale topography, and so forth, that their terraces
might exhibit and the degree that these terraces have been dissected
by erosion. These observations, which can be used to infer relative
age and correlate terraces and their underlying depositional units,
are often difficult to make using other imagery because temporal and
areal variations in moisture content of soils, vegetation, land use, and
other factors drastically change how well construction landforms can
be seen. Differences in the contour intervals between adjoining topographic maps also can make comparison of the degree of dissection
of terraces by erosion difficult if not impossible. Such differences and
variations are absent from LIDAR imagery, which together with the
enhanced detail it affords greatly facilitate the perception, discrimination, and interpretation of the meaningful
differences in the surfaces of Quaternary
geologic map units, i.e., those considered
diagnostic of them. This experience echoes
that chronicled by Haugerud and others
(2003) for the mapping of geologic hazards
in the Puget Lowland of Washington state.

Figure 1. Over much of Louisiana the “bedrock” geology is mantled by widespread and locally thick
surficial deposits and by extensive soil development, which in combination with dense vegetation
effectively obscures and conceals the units of interest to geologic-mapping efforts. In this schematic
cross-sectional diagram of a representative portion of the surface and shallow subsurface of the Fort
Polk region in west-central Louisiana, the Upland allogroup (Pliocene) and the two Miocene units are
the bedrock units of geologic interest. In the natural landscape they are covered nearly uniformly by
surficial materials developed in place (from McCulloh and Heinrich, 2002, their figure 5).

While this voluminous LIDAR-based
surface detail can “cut both ways” in certain
geologic-mapping contexts by obscuring and
overwhelming the limited number of surface
criteria that bear on a geologic issue or
problem being interpreted (McCulloh,
2005), as a rule the much-improved resolution of the surface readily facilitates an
improved and refined interpretation of its
exposed geology.

Conclusion

Acknowledgments

Following its debut in Louisiana in the late 1990s LIDAR quickly became a boon to geologic-mapping efforts, and in the ensuing decade
it has become an essential tool for geologic mapping because aspects
of the geologic and climatic setting in this humid-subtropical coastalplain region compromise the effectiveness of most other remotesensing techniques in geologic-mapping applications. Although in
some instances the wealth of terrain detail afforded by LIDAR may
overwhelm the particular criteria employed to resolve a geologicmapping problem and initially complicate its resolution, generally
speaking the availability of LIDAR imagery makes possible a great
degree of improvement and refinement of geologic interpretation.
Where it is available in other humid-subtropical and coastal-plain
regions, LIDAR imagery is likely
to prove similarly useful and
essential for geologic mapping.

Investigation of the surface geology of the Bon Wier 7.5-minute
quadrangle (Figure 3) was conducted for a project supported by
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), STATEMAP program, in fiscal
year 1994 under cooperative agreement number 1434-94-A-1233.
Investigations of the surface geology of the Brimstone 7.5-minute
quadrangle (Figure 2), Greensburg 7.5-minute quadrangle (Figure 5),
and Madisonville 7.5-minute quadrangle (Figure 4) were conducted
for a STATEMAP project supported by the USGS in fiscal year 1996
under cooperative agreement number 1434-HQ-96-AG-01490. Both
of the above projects were conducted prior to LIDAR availability.

Organizational History
The Louisiana Geological Survey (LGS) had its beginnings in 1869,
four years after the Civil War ended, when the Louisiana Legislature named Francis V. Hopkins, a Louisiana State University (LSU)
professor, to be the first State Geologist. His primary assistant was
Colonel Charles H. Lockett, head of LSU’s Corps of Cadets. They
published some of Louisiana’s first geologic reports as well as the first
topographical and geological maps of the state. In 1873, LSU being
without funds, their pioneering work came to an end.
In 1894, LSU Professor William Clendenin was hired to continue
Lerch’s work. He did so for three years, publishing a number of
geological, botanical and agricultural works.
In 1899, LSU hired Gilbert D. Harris of Cornell University to study the geology of the state. Until 1909 he and
his assistants published numerous maps and reports.
He initiated a tradition of cooperative work with the U.S. Geologic
Survey that continues to the present day. Once again, a lack of funds
caused the work of Harris and his staff to be discontinued.
