MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Between 8 and 15 of June 2006, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey within the US Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) jurisdictional areas along the proposed 33-mile (52.8 kilometer [km]) Hull to Mont
Belvieu pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located in Liberty and Chambers counties, Texas. Louise
Dreyfus Energy Services (LDES) is proposing to primarily expand an existing pipeline ROW by
30 feet (10 meters [m]) to facilitate in the installation of an additional 12-inch (30.48 centimeter
[cm]) diameter refined product pipeline. Although the proposed pipeline ROW is located on
private property and is privately funded, the crossing of USACE jurisdictional areas will require a
Section 404 permit issued by the USACE. As such, the areas within the purview of the USACE
along the proposed ROW also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
LDES contracted with Horizon to conduct an intensive cultural resources survey of the
USACE jurisdictional areas in compliance with the regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were located within the USACE
jurisdictional areas, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP). In all, the investigated USACE jurisdictional areas along the
proposed ROW total 28.
The survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed Hull to Mont Belvieu
pipeline ROW resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the
surface of any of the 28 investigated USACE jurisdictional areas or within any of the 99
excavated shovel tests. In general, the majority of the USACE jurisdictional areas contained
shallow clay soils with a decreased potential to contain subsurface cultural deposits.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas along the proposed 33-mile Hull to Mont Belvieu pipeline ROW, as well as
the low potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits at the majority of the jurisdictional
areas, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed 33-mile Hull to Mont Belvieu pipeline will have no
impact on significant cultural resources within the USACE jurisdictional areas and that no further
investigations are warranted at these locations. Horizon recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the undertaking.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas within the Proposed 33-Mile
Hull to Mont Belvieu Pipeline Right-of-Way, Liberty County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey conducted
within the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional areas along the proposed 33mile (52.8-kilometer [km]) Hull to Mont Belvieu pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located in Liberty
and Chambers counties, Texas (Figures 1 through 3). Louise Dreyfus Energy Services (LDES)
is proposing to primarily expand an existing pipeline ROW by approximately 30 feet (10 meters
[m]) to facilitate in the installation of an additional 12-inch (30.48-centimeter [cm]) diameter
refined product pipeline. Although the proposed pipeline ROW is located on private property
and is privately funded, the crossing of USACE jurisdictional areas will require a Section 404
permit issued by the USACE. As such, the areas within the purview of the USACE along the
proposed ROW also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
LDES contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct an
intensive cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas in compliance with the
regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
cultural resources were located within the USACE jurisdictional areas, and, if so, to determine
their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In all, the
investigated USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW total 28. While the USACE’s
jurisdiction is generally limited to the high water mark of river/creek/drainage channels or to the
first terrace above these channels, the generally low-lying nature of the proposed pipeline ROW
did not always afford clearly defined first terraces. As such, for purposes of this investigation,
the USACE jurisdictional areas were considered to be areas within 100 feet (30 meters [m]) of
each jurisdictional waterway. Utilizing this methodology, the investigated jurisdictional areas
total approximately 3.85 acres along the overall 33-mile ROW. Again, only the USACE
jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW were investigated since these are the only
locations requiring a federal permitting action, and as such, are regulated by Section 106 of the
NHPA.
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and

the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal
Investigator for the project. Jared Wiersema and Michael Mudd (Horizon field technicians)
conducted the field investigations between 8 and 15 of June 2006.
The survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed Hull to Mont Bevieu
pipeline ROW resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the
surface of any of the 28 investigated USACE jurisdictional areas or within any of the 99
excavated shovel tests. In general, the majority of the USACE jurisdictional areas contained
shallow clay soils with a decreased potential to contain subsurface cultural deposits. These
soils would have likely confined any cultural materials to shallow or surface contexts, and would
not have facilitated deeply buried, stratified deposits. The opposing banks of the Trinity River
were the only locations where the potential for deep alluvium existed. At this location, the
proposed pipeline will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drill (HDD) under the river channel.
As such, the general locations of the bore entry and exit were investigated. Both the bore entry
and exit locations are set back a considerable distance from the river channel, and, as such,
were located outside of areas of deep alluvium. The eastern side of the Trinity River produced
basal clay deposits at a depth of 80 centimeters below surface (cmbs), while the western side of
the Trinity River has been heavily disturbed in the past as a result of the construction of a water
treatment facility and drainage channel excavation. Investigations at both locations failed to
produce cultural materials.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas along the proposed 33-mile Hull to Mont Belvieu pipeline ROW, as well as
the low potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits at the majority of the jurisdictional
areas, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed 33-mile Hull to Mont Belvieu pipeline will have no
impact on significant cultural resources within the USACE jurisdictional areas and that no further
investigations are warranted at these locations. Horizon recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the undertaking.

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area consists of the USACE jurisdictional areas that are traversed by the
proposed Hull to Mont Belvieu pipeline. Overall, the proposed pipeline ROW consists of an
approximately 33-mile- (52.8-km-) long by 30-ft- (10-m-) wide pipeline ROW addition that will
serve to primarily expand an existing, previously disturbed pipeline ROW. As such, this new
proposed ROW will parallel the existing ROW. The proposed pipeline ROW initiates just south
of the town of Hull in northern Liberty County and terminates on the north side of Mont Belvieu
in Chambers County, just south of the Liberty/Chambers county line. It can be found on the US
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5’ Daisetta, Dayton, Devers, Hardin, Liberty, Moss Bluff, Sheeks,
Shiloh, Thorson Gully, Whites Bayou, Cove, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, topographic quadrangles
(see Figure 2).
The only federal permit that the construction of the proposed pipeline ROW will require
consists of a Section 404 permit issued by the USACE for impacts to “waters of the US.” As
such, only the USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed pipeline ROW fall under the
jurisdiction of Section 106 of the NHPA. For this reason, the specific Project Area within the
overall pipeline ROW consists only of the USACE jurisdictional areas traversed by the proposed
ROW. In all, the proposed pipeline ROW crosses a total of 28 waterways and drainages that
are considered to be within the jurisdiction of the USACE. These 28 USACE jurisdictional areas
are presented in Figures 4 through 8. In general, the USACE’s jurisdiction extends along the
first terrace bordering each bank of each waterway/drainage. As the physiography of Liberty
County is generally low-lying, flat, and featureless, attempting to utilize the notion of the first
terrace to focus the cultural resources survey efforts was not well suited due to the general lack
of defined terraces. As such, for purposes of reporting, the USACE jurisdictional areas at each
of the 28 waterways were arbitrarily defined as the areas within 100 ft (30.5 m) of each side of
the traversed waterways (Figures 4 through 8). Photographs of select USACE jurisdictional
areas are presented in Figures 9 through 21.

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed pipeline ROW is located primarily in Liberty County, Texas, with only a
short segment extending into Chambers County near the ROW’s southern terminus. Overall,
the proposed ROW is located within the Gulf Coastal Plain region of the state. Specifically,
the Project Area is located between the Coastal Prairie and Interior Coastal Plain of the
Gulf Coastal Plain (Wermund 2004). Beginning at the Gulf of Mexico, the elevation of the Gulf

Coastal Plains increases to the north and west. Elevation within Liberty County ranges from 20
feet (6.1 m) to 50 feet (15.2 m); the land tends to be more level in the central and southern
portions of the county and more undulating in the northern and western portions of the county.
Eroding deltaic sands, silts, and clay form slight slopes and flat grasslands.
Hydrologically, the proposed pipeline ROW is situated within the Trinity River basin. The
Trinity River runs in a north-to-south orientation through the middle of Liberty County. The
Trinity River supplies water to a number of reservoirs along its length; the largest of which is
Lake Livingston, located in Polk and San Jacinto counties. The estimated drainage area of the
Trinity River is 28,912 square km (17,969 square miles).
The proposed pipeline ROW traverses the Trinity River as well as a number of its
tributaries. Again, 28 of these waterways are considered to be under the jurisdiction of the
USACE. A number of these tributaries drain into sloughs and marshes located in the southern
portion of Liberty County. These low-lying water bodies are adjacent to and drain into the Trinity
River.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The Coastal Plain is underlain by both Mesozoic and Cenozoic age sedimentary strata.
These beds decline in elevation from the interior portion of the Coastal Plain to the Gulf Coast
(Handbook 2006a). While the Upper Cretaceous strata are present in outcroppings along the
interior portion of the Coastal Plain, Tertiary and Pleistocene deposits underlie the remaining
portions of the Coastal Plain (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996). The Project Area is located

HJN 060067 AR

27

Chapter 2.0: Project Area Description

between the Coastal Prairies and Interior Coastal Plains regions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. This
region is composed of low, flat landforms and is underlain by Pleistocene deposits such as the
Lissie Formation (Hentz 2006a). Specifically, the Lissie Formation consists of Pleistocene age
deposits that are composed of clay, silt, sand, and small amounts of gravel. These deposits are
fluvatile and very gently rolling; they are approximately 61.96 m (200 ft) thick in most areas
(Barnes et al. 1974). The soil information for the Project Area was gathered from the US
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Survey of Liberty County, Texas (USDA, 1996). The
available information for the 15 soil types within the Project Area is presented in Table 1.

2.3

CLIMATE

The modern climate within Liberty County is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot
summers and short, mild winters. The climate is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air
masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air
masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and fall. Rainfall peaks in the spring and fall,
as does the possibility of tropical storms. These storms threaten the Texas coast infrequently
with hurricane intensity, and the risk of the storms making landfall at any particular location is
slight. The average rainfall in Hardin County is 134 cm (51 inches). The average low
temperature is 5 degrees Celsius (C) (40 degrees Fahrenheit [F]) in January; the average high
temperature is 34 degrees C (94 degrees F) in July.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is in the southern portion of the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950). This province includes the Gulf Coastal Plain from East Texas to the Atlantic (Dice
1943). The western boundary of the Austroriparian province includes pine and hardwood
forests; the extent of these forests is limited to the available moisture. The pine-oak forest is
inhabited by other species of plants, including but not limited to longleaf pine, loblolly pine,
sweetgum, post oak, blackjack, and way myrtle. In the lowland areas, magnolia, water oak, and
tupelo, as well as other species of oak, elm, and ashe, are also present (Blair 1950). These
plant species are most conspicuous in the Big Thicket area, which includes the northeast
portion of Liberty County. Salt marsh vegetation is present within the south central portion of
the county. These marshes contain salt-tolerant grasses, including smooth cordgrass,
glasswort, maritime saltwort, and salt grass (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996). In addition, other
salt-tolerant species such as spikerush, fimbry, sea purslane, and cattail are supported in this
environment. Within the floodplain or in seasonally inundated areas, various grasses such as
lotus, cattail, and sedges are represented (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996).
The Austroriparian province is home to a wide variety of species (Blair 1950). Reptilian
and amphibian species present within the region include snapping turtle, diamondback terrapin,
Gulf Coast toad, American alligator, cottonmouth, and eastern hognose snake (TPWD 2006).
Avian species, both migratory and territorial, include gulls, terns, American white pelican, duck,
Canada goose, white ibis, egret, heron, American oystercatcher, belted kingfisher, red-winged
blackbird, larks, wrens, sparrows, and peregrine falcon (TPWD 2006). Mammalian species
include but are not limited to opossum, shrew, eastern mole, bats, raccoons, river otter, mink,

longtail weasel, skunk, squirrel, gopher, mice, rats, beaver, swamp rabbit, peccary, deer, bison,
and armadillo (TPWD 2006). Predatory species such as cougars, foxes, coyote, wolf, and
bears are also present within the region (TPWD, 2006). Additionally, a wide variety of fish and
shellfish are present within the bayous, rivers, and coastal waters of the area.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21county area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 200 km (124 miles) inland from the Texas gulf coastline. In broad terms, much
of the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between the Southern
Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995; Story 1989).
Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of
Southeast Texas. These 2 subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the inland
subregion has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast Texas
comprises a zone about 25 km (16 miles) inland from the coast that covers the area influenced
by gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable ecological variability
characterizes this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes, wetlands, marine
coastline, and barrier islands. The inland subregion also encompasses considerable ecological
diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to
denote Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural
characteristics of Southeast Texas cultural periods are often different than in neighboring
regions. For instance, the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and
Southeast Texas, and Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for
Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time
in Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit
evidence of reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be
associated with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of
subsistence-related activities. Inland sites tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired
clay balls (at some sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites
tend to consist of multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain oyster shell tools, large
quantities of pottery (in later cultural components), numerous bone tools, and few lithic
materials.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5000 BC)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 BC (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (but see Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is
represented by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 BC) (Patterson 1995). This stage
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end
scrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas
are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is
little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced during all prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 BC), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian
period (8000 to 5000 BC), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5000 BC TO AD 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 BC to AD 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas.
Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and
corresponding decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a
diversified resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas,
however, this hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The
appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone
assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural

32

Hull to Mont Belvieu Pipeline Right-of-Way, Liberty County, Texas

stage. Material culture shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in
the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 BC) is marked by the presence of
Bell, Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The
Bell point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains.
Many of the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 BC) and
several new types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and
probably the Gary-Kent series. The Late Archaic period (1500 BC to AD 100) is characterized
by Gary, Kent, Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition
developed in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981;
Patterson 1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period
but reached full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as
boatstones and bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang
knives, stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial
practices included the systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre,
and use of locally made grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most
burials are found in extended supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials
are also known. Burial direction is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to
site. Patterson et al. (1993) report that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary
tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (AD 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 BC, in the Galveston Bay area by
about AD 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about AD 300, and in the ConroeLivingston inland area by about AD 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears to have
progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995).
Southeastern Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where
Aten (1983) established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area
129 km (80 miles) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal exception of
a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf
coast west of the Sabine Lake area.

HJN 060067 AR

33

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and early part of the Historic period (Aten
1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility ware
throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown Plain
for about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods
before once again becoming predominant in the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety,
Goose Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor
pottery types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway
(Aten 1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte
types are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste
(like Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (AD 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (AD 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the
latter part of the Late Prehistoric period, but, as previously discussed, ceramics appear earlier in
Southeast Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion along with the bow and arrow through the
Late Prehistoric period (Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995;
Wheat 1953). In fact, Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in
Southeast Texas as early as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points
that consisted of marginally retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a
generalized date of adoption of the bow-and-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca.
AD 600) in Central and Southeast Texas. In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to
be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba,
Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. A serial sequence for these point types has not been
established in Southeast Texas, though Scallorn points appear to predate Perdiz points
throughout the rest of Texas.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto
Plain and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek
pottery remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt
Coated pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (AD 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1989:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue.
Aten (1983) has
reconstructed the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century,
including the Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco/Karankawa, and Tonkawa. The presence of the
Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central Texas in the
17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought to have
occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the
corresponding mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east
of the San Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe
may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic period
(Patterson et al. 1993; Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in
identifying Historic Indian sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and
possibly Fresno and Cuney points after AD 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites
are usually identified by the presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types
of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (AD 1700 TO PRESENT)

Liberty and Chambers counties were part of the Atascosito District of the Spanish and
Mexican Texas (Handbook of Texas 2006b). This area was not heavily settled until 1834-35,
when the Mexican government issued over 50 land grants within the area. In 1840, James
Taylor White began a thriving cattle company in Chambers County, greatly bolstering the local
economy. The population of the region continued to increase, continually drawing planters and
lumbermen through the 1840s and 1850s. While slavery was practiced within the county, the
majority of the county residents employed subsistence agriculture over cash-crop agriculture. In
1860, Liberty County residents voted for secession by a margin of 422 to 10. During the 1870s,
the raising of livestock increased, as did the number of farms; however, the logging industry
became the focus of the industrial economy in the region throughout the 19th century.
In 1871, the Trinity River Navigation company formed to run steamships from the town of
Liberty to Galveston. Although Federal funds were appropriated to increase the navigability of
the Trinity, the construction of the railroad caused the Port of Liberty to falter. The year 1901
marked the beginning of oil prospecting in the region. Daisetta and Hull, near the northeast
terminus of the Project Area, became oil boomtowns when deposits were discovered in 1918
(Handbook 2006b).
Due to the presence of abundant surface water, rice became a very important staple
crop in the region in the first 2 decades of the 20th century. Thusly, Liberty County was spared
some of the “agricultural fluctuations” experienced during the Great Depression (Handbook of

HJN 060067 AR

35

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Texas 2006b). The Liberty fairgrounds served as a German prisoners of war camp during the
Second World War. After the war and to the present day, the majority of the region was utilized
by farming and ranching, although timber remains the county’s primary agricultural product.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

In order to determine if any previously recorded archeological sites, historic structures,
or cemeteries were documented within or adjacent to any of the USACE jurisdictional areas
within the proposed pipeline ROW, Horizon conducted archival research via the Internet at the
Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas web site (Atlas 2006).
This review indicated that there are no previously recorded archeological sites or historic
structures within 1 mile (1.2 km) of either side of the proposed ROW. However, the Oakdale
Cemetery is documented approximately 50 m (164 ft) north of the proposed ROW, where it
crosses Long Island Creek, just south of the town of Daisetta. At this time, no records were
found that document this cemetery. It is not recorded within the limits of the current ROW.
The archival review also indicated that the overall pipeline ROW has not been
thoroughly assessed for cultural resources in the past. The ROW does cross 2 linear survey
areas that have been assessed in the past. The first previously surveyed area is located on the
Trinity River where the proposed ROW passes near Negro Bend. This survey, conducted in
1988 for a USACE-permitted project, appears to have been a boat survey that inspected the
banks of the Trinity River. It failed to document any cultural resources in the vicinity of the
currently proposed ROW. The second previously surveyed area crossed by the current pipeline
ROW is located just north of the town of Mont Belvieu. Based on the linear nature of this
previous survey, it appears to have been conducted for another pipeline ROW. No date was
available for this survey, although it too was conducted for a project permitted by the USACE. It
also resulted in negative findings in the vicinity of the currently proposed ROW.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed pipeline ROW between 8 and 13 June
2006. This included intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel tests within each of the
USACE jurisdictional areas. Prior to entering the field, all USACE jurisdictional areas that were
visible on the topographic quadrangles were assigned sequential numbers (1 through 28)
beginning at the north end of the pipeline ROW and terminating at the south end.
Subsequently, all investigations at each of the USACE jurisdictional areas utilized the
corresponding area number when collecting field data. For example, shovel tests at each
jurisdictional area were assigned the corresponding number as well as a specific shovel test
number (e.g., shovel tests in jurisdictional area 16 were labeled ST 16-1, ST 16-2, etc.).
Similarly, notes and photographs were labeled in regard to the respective jurisdictional areas
from which they were gathered.
It should be noted that only those USACE jurisdictional areas that had an increased
potential to contain cultural deposits were labeled (e.g., creeks, drainages, etc.). Upland wet
areas that technically qualify as USACE jurisdictional wetlands, but were off-channel and
possessed a low potential for cultural deposits based on their distance from waterways, were
not assessed. In all, a total of 28 USACE jurisdictional areas were investigated (see Figures 5
through 8).
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards require a minimum of 3
shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 0 to 2 acres in size. Rather than lumping
the total acreage of all the USACE jurisdictional areas together for this specific survey, the
Horizon field crew assessed each USACE jurisdictional area as if it encompassed 1 total acre,
although in reality each jurisdictional area measured considerably less than 1 acre. Because an
area measuring 100 feet wide on each side of each waterway was considered to be a USACE
jurisdictional area, the actual acreage at each location equated more to around 0.13 acres (200
feet by 30 feet). Regardless, the Horizon field crew set out to excavate a minimum of 3 to 4
shovel tests at each USACE jurisdictional area; preferably 2 on each bank. When assessed in
regard to overall acreage, a total of 7 shovel tests would have been required for the 3.85 acres
comprising the USACE jurisdictional areas. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards
by excavating a total of 99 shovel tests.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for

every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate.
The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in Figures
22 through 26. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed Hull to Mont Bevieu
pipeline ROW resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the
surface of any of the 28 investigated USACE jurisdictional areas or within any of the 99
excavated shovel tests. In general, the majority of the USACE jurisdictional areas contained
shallow clay soils with a decreased potential to contain subsurface cultural deposits. These
soils would have likely confined any cultural materials to shallow or surface contexts, and would
not have facilitated deeply buried, stratified deposits. The opposing banks of the Trinity River
were the only locations where the potential for deep alluvium existed. At this location, the
proposed pipeline will be installed via HDD under the river channel. As such, the general
locations of the bore entry and exit were investigated. Both the bore entry and exit locations are
set back a considerable distance from the river channel, and, as such, were located outside of
areas of deep alluvium. The eastern side of the Trinity River produced basal clay deposits at a
depth of 80 cmbs, while the western side of the Trinity River has been heavily disturbed in the
past as a result of the construction of a water treatment facility and drainage channel
excavation. Investigations at both locations failed to produce cultural materials.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas along the proposed 33-mile Hull to Mont Belvieu pipeline ROW, as well as
the low potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits at the majority of the jurisdictional
areas, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed 33-mile Hull to Mont Belvieu pipeline will have no
impact on significant cultural resources within the USACE jurisdictional areas and that no further
investigations are warranted at these locations. Horizon recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the undertaking.

REROUTE ADDENDUM

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas within the Proposed 33-Mile
Hull to Mont Belvieu Pipeline Right-of-Way, Liberty County, Texas

ADDENDUM: REROUTE

B.1 INTRODUCTION
Following the completion of the cultural resources survey of the original alignment of the
proposed Hull to Mont Belvieu pipeline ROW, a reroute of a portion of the alignment was
deemed necessary in order to avoid properties owned or maintained by the US Fish and Wildlife
Service (USFWS) and the Coastal Industrial Water Authority (CIWA). This amounted to a
segment of new ROW near the Trinity River that measures approximately 4250 ft (1296.3 m) in
length and 60 ft (18.3 m) in width. This reroute initiates at a point on the previously surveyed
ROW just east of Negro Bend on the Trinity River (Figure B1). From this point, the reroute
extends to the west-southwest a short distance before turning west toward the Trinity River.
The proposed pipeline will be installed underneath the Trinity River via a Horizontal Direction
Drill (HDD) that measures 1839 ft (560.9 m). Both the HDD entry and exit points are located
beyond the limits of USACE jurisdiction on opposing sides of the Trinity River (see Figure B1).
Once the HDD exits on the western side of the Trinity, it skirts the outer edge of an area owned
by CIWA before it again reconnects with the previously assessed ROW (see Figure B1).
As with the original alignment, the new ROW is again located on private property and the
project is privately funded. However, 2 small wetland areas are present along the southern
extent of the reroute (Figures B2 and B3). Impacts to these 2 small wetland areas have been
included in the revised Section 404 permit application submitted to the USACE for the project,
and, as such, these 2 areas also fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the NHPA. At the
request of LDES, Horizon completed an intensive cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas associated with the 2 wetland areas along the reroute on 21 November
2006. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were present within
the USACE jurisdictional areas, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.
In all, the USACE jurisdictional areas along the rerouted segment total 0.55 acres.

B.2 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The 2 USACE jurisdictional areas present along the reroute are found on the
southwestern edge of the CIWA property where the ROW crosses the upper extent of a
drainage that leads to the Trinity River floodplain (see Figures B1, B2, and B3). As can be seen
on the aerial photograph (Figure B3), the area to the east within the CIWA property boundaries
has been cleared and graded, while the ROW along its boundaries remains heavily wooded.
Representative photos of the USACE jurisdictional areas are presented in Figures B4 through
B7.

B.3 METHODOLOGY
The methodology employed during the survey of the rerouted realignment was the same
as that employed during the survey of the original alignment. A Horizon archeologist completed
the intensive pedestrian survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed pipeline
ROW reroute on 21 November 2006. This included intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel tests within each of the USACE jurisdictional areas.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards require a minimum of 3
shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 0 to 2 acres in size. Rather than lumping
the total acreage of all the USACE jurisdictional areas together for survey of the reroute, the
Horizon archeologist assessed each USACE jurisdictional area as if it encompassed 1 total
acre, although in reality each jurisdictional area measured considerably less than 1 acre.
Because an area measuring 100 feet wide on each side of each waterway was considered to be
a USACE jurisdictional area, the actual acreage at each location equated more to around 0.28
acres (200 feet by 60 feet).
Regardless, the Horizon archeologist set out to excavate a
minimum of 3 to 4 shovel tests at each USACE jurisdictional area; preferably 2 on each bank.
When assessed in regard to overall acreage, a total of 2 shovel tests would have been required
for the 0.55 acres comprising the USACE jurisdictional areas along the reroute. Horizon
exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a total of 6 shovel tests.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate.
The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure
B8. Shovel test data are presented in Table B1.

B.4 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The survey of the 2 USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed Hull to Mont Belvieu
pipeline ROW reroute resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were
observed on the surface of either of the 2 USACE jurisdictional areas or within any of the 6
excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the 2 USACE
jurisdictional areas along the rerouted segment of the Hull to Mont Belvieu pipeline ROW, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the proposed ROW reroute will have no impact on significant cultural
resources within the USACE jurisdictional areas and that no further investigations are warranted
at these 2 locations. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for
these 2 locations.
