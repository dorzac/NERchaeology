MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Between October 22, 2007, and March 20, 2009, Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted National Register
of Historic Places eligibility testing and data recovery excavations at prehistoric site 41DL203
under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4695. The testing phase, which consisted of 30
mechanical trenches and 14 associated hand excavation units, recovered approximately 7,000
artifacts, including fire-cracked rocks, bone fragments, pieces of mussel shell, baked clay masses,
and lithics. Nearly 90 percent of these materials were concentrated in three test units. The test
unit with the greatest concentration of materials and the lowest level of postdepositional
disturbance, Test Unit B5, was chosen for data recovery excavations. Therefore, a 5-x-5-meter
block adjacent to Test Unit B5 was excavated in 5-centimeter levels to capture high-resolution
data, recovering nearly 30,000 artifacts from approximately 41 cubic meters of matrix and
included ceramics in addition to the material classes mentioned above. The alluvial deposits at
site 41DL203 displayed marked stratification, with prominent increases and decreases in material
concentrations associated with gravel lenses. Although the testing phase identified only Late
Archaic components, the mitigation phase also documented Late Prehistoric materials in upper
levels. Analysis of the extensive datasets from the latest excavations and from the testing phase
addressed some of the fundamental issues highlighted in regional research frameworks. The
regional topics most relevant to site 41DL203 included paleoenvironmental reconstruction,
subsistence, chronology, settlement systems, and exchange. In addition, geoarchaeological study
at both the macro and micro scales formed an integral part of the overall site interpretation,
illuminating site formation processes and stratigraphic integrity.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The successful completion of the testing and mitigation work at site 41DL203 would not have
been possible without the opportunity and guidance provided by the North Texas Tollway
Authority (NTTA) and HNTB Corporation environmental manager Scott Inglish. Chris Brook of
Michael Baker, Jr., Inc., responsible for environmental oversight, also provided additional
coordination and field logistical support.
The initial portion of Geo-Marineâs testing at site 41DL203 was carried out by Jennifer
Anderson, Matt Cuba, Lana Martin, and Noel Steinle, supervised by Clayton Tinsley. Later
testing and data recovery excavations were undertaken by Johnathan Comer, Steven Dunn, Karen
Jordan, Bethany Oliver, Lindsey Skelton, Jay Smith, Adam Thompson, and Jamie Vandagriff,
supervised by Chris Dayton. Geoarchaeological fieldwork was performed by Charles Frederick,
who also served as a sounding board for ideas about all aspects of the project. David Taylor and
Danny Chavis of D. A. Taylor, Co., mechanically excavated the test trenches, prepared the area
selected for data recovery, and backfilled the testing and mitigation units.
In the Geo-Marine laboratory, Steve Hunt, Bethany Oliver, and Lindsey Skelton processed and
recorded all excavated materials, and Jamie Vandagriff floated bulk samples collected during the
testing and data recovery phases. Additional analyses were provided by Dr. Steve Tomka
(lithics), Susan Allen (wood charcoal) and Charles Randklev and Steve Wolverton (mollusca).
Charles Frederick performed micromorphological and granulometric analyses of sediments
collected at the site.
Joshua Sales and Joseph Moran produced the maps and diagrams in the report. Sharlene Allday
edited the text. Formatting and document production were handled by Denise Pemberton.
Without their efforts, this project would not have been possible.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
by Chris Dayton Ph.D.

Between October 22, 2007, and March 20, 2009, Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine), conducted
testing and data recovery excavations at prehistoric site 41DL203 (Geo-Marine project numbers
32004.00.05 and 20030.01.01) under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4695. Initially
undertaken for the Texas Department of Transportation, Environmental Affairs Division (TxDOT
ENV), portions of the testing and all of the subsequent data recovery work were completed under
contract to HNTB Corporation (HNTB) and the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA).
Site 41DL203 is located north of Pleasant Valley Road between the relict and channelized
Rowlett Creek channels in the City of Garland, Dallas County, Texas, partly within a right-ofway (ROW) of 122 meters (m) wide of the Eastern Extension of the President George Bush
Turnpike, currently under construction (Figure 1). Although the siteâs location was originally
recorded by investigators from Southern Methodist University as a prehistoric burial site adjacent
to the channelized portion of Rowlett Creek, north of the project area discussed in this volume,
later work by Hicks & Co. (Feit and Stotts 2006) and Geo-Marine (reported in subsequent
chapters of the present report) expanded the siteâs boundary to include most of the ROW between
the relict and artificial channels. Throughout this volume, the term âproject areaâ refers to the
portion of the site within the ROW, as that was the focus of Geo-Marineâs investigations for
TxDOT ENV and NTTA.
As mentioned above, the investigations reported in this volume were carried out under multiple
contracts in 2007 and 2008. First, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility testing,
consisting of mechanical trenching and associated manually excavated units, was initiated in
October 2007 under contract to TxDOT ENV (Work Authorization 577 05 SA004; CSJ 2964-06009). Fieldwork was performed under this contract until November 2007, when funding was
discontinued due to reconfiguration of transportation funding at the state and federal levels.
Ownership of the project was subsequently transferred from TxDOT ENV to NTTA. In May
2008, HNTB and NTTA subcontracted with Geo-Marine under contract 02383-PGB-06-PS-PM
to continue archaeological investigations of site 41DL203. Modifications to Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4695 were approved by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in September
2008, clearing the way for the resumption of NRHP eligibility testing.

The remainder of the testing was completed in early October 2008. Overall, the testing in both
2007 and 2008 documented significant deposits of prehistoric cultural materials between the
channelized and natural channels of Rowlett Creek. In late October 2008, Geo-Marine submitted
a draft interim report to NTTA, TxDOT ENV, and THC evaluating 41DL203 as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP (per 36 CFR Â§ 60.4) and recommending mitigation via data recovery
excavations of the portion of the site to be directly affected by construction of the Eastern
Extension of the President George Bush Turnpike. Due to particularly high concentrations of
materials in a confined area, Geo-Marineâs data recovery recommendations focused on the
excavation of a single 5-x-5-m block adjacent to the creekâs relict channel. Geo-Marine received
notice of concurrence on December 18, 2008, began data recovery excavations at site 41DL203
the following month, and completed this final phase of fieldwork on March 20, 2009.
This report presents the final results of both the testing and data recovery phases of
archaeological investigation at site 41DL203, with discussions regarding the environmental and
cultural setting, the field and laboratory methods, and the excavation results from both phases of
investigations. Geoarchaeologist Charles Frederick and paleobotanist Susan Allen reconstruct the
history of the landscape around site 41DL203, and how changes in that landscape over time may
have affected human occupations. Faunal analysts Clayton Tinsley, Charles Randklev, and Steve
Wolverton present the analyses of animal bone and mussel shell recovered during both phases of
the investigations, and lithics analyst Steve Tomka discusses the chipped stone tools and lithic
debitage found at the site, again from both phases of fieldwork. A discussion of the general
results and the specialized analyses interprets the siteâs deposits and materials and places them in
a broader context, with particular emphasis placed on regionally important research themes such
as paleoenvironmental reconstruction, refinement of chronologies, elucidation of settlement
patterns and subsistence regimes, and implications for trade and exchange. Full details of the

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
by Chris Dayton Ph.D.

HYDROLOGY AND PHYSIOGRAPHY
Site 41DL203 is located in northeast Dallas County, near the Collin County line, at an elevation
of 140.8 m (462 ft) above mean sea level (amsl). The siteâs environs are included within the East
Fork drainage of the Trinity River, which was heavily modified by several large U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE) flood control and reservoir projects during the mid- to late twentieth
century. The site is located on a floodplain formed by the meandering natural channel of Rowlett
Creek, now largely dry except during heavy rains. The relict natural channel has been supplanted
by a straighter, deeper artificial channel that carries the areaâs runoff 7.5 kilometers (km) south
into the western arm of Lake Ray Hubbard, a reservoir managed by Dallas Water Utilities, a
department of the City of Dallas.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The surface geology of the site is mapped as undifferentiated Quaternary alluvium underlain by
Cretaceous limestone of the Ozan Formation (Stoeser et al. 2007). The dominant soil map unit at
the site and along the rest of the Rowlett Creek floodplain is Frio silty clay, an extremely deep,
fine, calcareous soil prone to frequent flooding when foundâas it is in the 41DL203 areaâon
slopes of 0â2 percent (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2008). The siteâs
geological history and pedogenic contextâand the archaeological implications of those
parametersâare addressed in greater detail in Chapter 7.

CLIMATE
The greater Dallas area is classified as humid subtropical, with mild winters and hot summers. At
Lavon Dam, 14 km northeast of site 41DL203 and the closest National Weather Service
monitoring station, climatologists have recorded 30-year (1971â2000) normals that include the
following: an average annual maximum temperature of 75Â°F, an average annual minimum
temperature of 52Â°F, and 102 centimeters (cm) of annual precipitation, much of it concentrated in
5

heavy thunderstorms, with a peak in May and a nadir in August. The lowest temperature ever
recorded in Dallas was -8Â°F in 1899, and the highest in the greater Dallas area was 118Â°F in
McKinney in 1936. Although these early extreme measurements may be suspect, the trend they
illustrate is valid; the winters do include brief cold snaps with temperatures in the teens and
twenties, and in the summer, 100-plus degree days are extremely common (National Weather
Service Weather Forecast Office [NWSWFO] 2009).

FLORA AND FAUNA
The area around site 41DL203âand indeed most of Dallas and nearby Collin countiesâfalls
within the Blackland Prairie ecological region (Griffith et al. 2004), a subunit within the larger
Southern Tallgrass Prairie of Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas (Nature Conservancy
2009). Native grasses include bluestem, dropseeds, eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, and yellow
Indiangrass (Telfair 1999). In contrast to the coarser, more permeable soils of the nearby Cross
Timbers ecological region, the heavy clay soils of the Blackland Prairie generally allow tree
growth only in riparian contexts (Prikryl 1990). Trees found in these limited areas may include
bois dâarc or osage orange, eastern red cedar, and hackberry, in addition to multiple varieties of
cottonwood, elm, oak, and pecan (Telfair 1999). A caveat that must be kept in mind is that these
prairies and associated environments are now considered âamong the most profoundly altered
landscapes in the United Statesâ: first by farming and ranching, later by urban, suburban, and
exurban sprawl (Bezanson 2001:54). After centuries of disturbance and decades of deliberate
replacement of tree and grass species, only isolated examples of prehistoric and early historic
vegetation communities remain today (Telfair 1999).
Faunal communities of the Blackland Prairie have been similarly disrupted. Common animals
include birds such as bobwhites and mourning doves; small mammals such as cottontails,
opossums, raccoons, skunks, and squirrels; and riverine and riparian fauna such as turtles and
various species of fish and shellfish. Prehistoric and early historic period inhabitants of the area
would have encountered these animals, in addition to antelope, bison, prairie chicken, and wolf,
none of which are observed in the area today (Telfair 1999). Animal populations and their
relevance to prehistoric human occupations will be further discussed in Chapter 8.

Paleo-Indian
Point types found in Northcentral Texas that can be associated with the early to late parts of the
Paleo-Indian period include Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Plainview, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff.
Based on a sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl (1990) has concluded that
among the most common Paleo-Indian point types in this area are Plainview and Dalton. Ferring
and Yates (1997) suggest that these types date to about 10,000â9,500 years ago, based on cross
dating with other regions. The suggested age for these types may correspond with the onset of
early Holocene alluviation in the local river valleys, including the Trinity and Sabine. The
majority of the recorded Paleo-Indian sites cluster in the upper Trinity drainage, where the most
intensive archaeological investigations have taken place, though often these sites consist of no
more than one or two projectile points. The generally low density of Paleo-Indian artifacts and
sites and the tendency for projectile points to be made from nonlocal lithics have led investigators
to characterize these populations as highly mobile, with low regional densities (Lynott 1981:100â
101).
The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts
(Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995). The Field Ranch site (41CO10), along the upper Elm
Fork of the Trinity River, is a prime example of typical site contexts (Jensen 1968).
Interestingly, the only two investigated sites in Northcentral Texas with apparently discrete
Paleo-Indian components, the Lewisville Lake and Aubrey sites, are early, both producing Clovis
projectile points. The Lewisville Lake site (41DN72) contained 27 hearth features with an
associated Clovis point and other sparse lithics (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958; Story 1990:182â
184). Although the original radiocarbon dates on the hearths suggested an anomalously early age
for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 years ago) (Crook 1956), later work by the Smithsonian Institution
(Stanford 1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation
there. Apparently, the presence of naturally occurring lignite in these hearths, either as a fuel or
as an inadvertent inclusion, contaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually
accepted age of 10,000â12,000 years ago for Clovis period occupations is probably a reasonable
estimate for the first human inhabitants of Northcentral Texas. The deeply buried Aubrey site
(41DN479), located on the Elm Fork north of Dallas, yielded lithic debitage and Clovis points
buried beneath 8 m (26 ft) of Holocene alluvium on the Elm Fork floodplain (Ferring 1989,
2001). The discovery of this site suggests that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral
Texas will only be found by examining deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in modern floodplain
situations.
The Lewisville Lake and Aubrey sites contained a variety of faunal remains, both large and small.
The largest, white-tailed deer, can be associated comfortably with the Clovis occupation at the
Lewisville Lake site. The preponderance of small game at the Aubrey site could be interpreted as
representing a more generalized pattern of foraging than the reliance on mammoth and bison
apparently demonstrated at Clovis sites on the Southern Plains (Hofman 1989a:31â32). Such a
divergence in subsistence patterns may reflect an inherent adaptability of Clovis technology to
changing environmental conditions encountered as early populations spread southeastward into
Texas (Ferring and Yates 1997).
There are no excavated and reported Paleo-Indian stratified components on the central Blackland
Prairie itself. Nonetheless, a variety of early points has been found, largely in surface contexts,
and it is clear that this part of Texas was used throughout the period from ca. 9,500 to 7,000 B.C.
Presumably, this use was by hunter-gatherer groups with low population densities and high
8

residential mobility. An analysis of materials collected by C. K. Chandler and other avocational
archaeologists from sites chiefly in Ellis County during the Superconducting Super Collider
project identified a handful of Paleo-Indian projectile points typed as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Golondrina, and San Patrice, along with several untyped lanceolate specimens (Yedlowski et al.
1998). Other early materials from the area include a few San Patrice points from the RichlandChambers Reservoir (McGregor and Bruseth 1987) and a cache of 23 prismatic blades from a site
in Navarro County (Young and Collins 1989).

Archaic
For Northcentral Texas, the Archaic is tentatively dated between ca. 7000 B.C. and A.D. 700, with
segments of approximately 2,500 years often considered as early, middle, and late divisions of the
period (Prikryl 1993:199). Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 7000 to 4000 B.C., the
Middle Archaic from 4000 to 2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 2000 B.C. to A.D. 700.
Relatively recent overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Hofman
(1989a), Prikryl (1990), and Story (1985, 1990). Diagnostic artifacts for the period are similar to
those of adjacent regions, although developing a sound chronological sequence of diagnostic tool
types has proven difficult because many of the investigations have focused on surface
manifestations. Prikryl (1990) suggests that Early Archaic projectile points include early splitstemmed varieties and possibly Angostura, and Middle Archaic points include basal-notched
forms such as Andice, Bell, and Calf Creek along with Bulverde, Carrollton, Dawson, and Wells.
Late Archaic point types reportedly include Castroville, Dallas, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, Gary,
Godley, Marshall, Palmillas, Trinity, and Yarbrough (Prikryl 1990). At one time, the Carrollton
and Elam foci were used to define the Middle and Late Archaic, respectively (Crook and Harris
1952, 1954). Reevaluation of the type-site artifacts, however, showed that the materials were so
mixed that perpetuation of these foci provides little interpretive value (Hofman et al. 1989;
Prikryl 1990). Some of this mixing and the generally low numbers of Early and Middle Archaic
sites may be due to extensive erosion of mid-Holocene deposits, as has been documented for the
Brazos River drainage west of the Dallas area in Young, Stephens, and Throckmorton counties
(Ensor et al. 1992).
Though few isolable components have been analyzed for the various divisions of the Archaic
period in Northcentral Texas, slowly increasing populations responding to warmer and drier
environmental conditions have been postulated to explain the overall archaeological record of the
period (Lynott 1981; Story 1990). It is thought that these factors may have led Archaic
populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of Northcentral Texas to develop a diversified
hunting and gathering pattern based on bottomland resources of the rivers and major creeks,
whereas populations on the Rolling Plains maintained a focus on bison hunting (Hofman 1989a).
Projectile points of the period were fashioned from local lithic materials, suggesting that
populations were less mobile than were their Paleo-Indian predecessors. Less mobility also may
suggest refinement of the diversified subsistence pattern to include scheduling of resource use
within more restricted areas. Evidence from Late Archaic sites at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and
McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997) indicates repeated site
occupation by small groups, which could support the resource-scheduling hypothesis. Still, even
with refinement of resource utilization, evidence of dietary stress has been found on Late Archaic
human skeletal materials (Ferring and Yates 1997; Gill-King 1987).

9

Mixing of components also has hampered interpretations regarding downstream Trinity River use
by prehistoric peoples during the lengthy Archaic period. Because few pure Archaic components
have been excavated, particularly ones dating to the first two-thirds of the period, it is difficult to
say much about artifact chronologies, subsistence practices, or settlement strategies. A variety of
projectile point styles traditionally associated with the Early and Middle Archaic periods in
Central Texasâfor example, Andice, Angostura, Bell, Gower, Hoxie, Martindale, Nolan, Travis,
and Uvalde (Yedlowski et al. 1998)âwere identified during analyses for the Superconducting
Super Collider project (although a host of other types perhaps dating to this time and later were
identified as well, their chronologies are less certain), but these points are few in number and do
not appear to represent major occupation of this part of the Blackland Prairie. Demonstrably
early points were even scarcer at the nearby Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir and the
Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills Reservoir, with a Hoxie point from Pecan Springs being the
clearest example (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et al. 1966). The relatively intensive work at RichlandChambers Reservoir suggests a similar conclusion for the western edge of the Oak Woodlands at
the eastern margin of the Blackland Prairie, although it has been noted that data pertaining to the
Early to Middle Archaic may be scarce in part because sites dating to this interval lie deeply
buried or were removed by extensive erosion during the mid-Holocene (Fields 1995; McGregor
and Bruseth 1987). Only a few radiocarbon assays predating 4,000 years ago were obtained, but
points dated to this interval in Central Texas (for example, Bell/Andice/Calf Creek and Hoxie)
occur at the Richland-Chambers Reservoir in only very small numbers.
A much different picture is presented for the late portion of the Archaic period, after about
2000 B.C. All areas of the central Blackland Prairie that have been studied archaeologically
contain sites dating to this period, and the Late Archaic represents the earliest time for which
much is known about indigenous prehistoric lifeways. Both the Pecan Springs and Strawn Creek
sites on the Blackland Prairie proper yielded Late Archaic point types such as Gary, Dawson, and
Yarbrough, although they tended to be mixed with materials from later occupations (Duffield
1963; Sorrow et al. 1966). The surface collections analyzed during the Superconducting Super
Collider project also contained these types, as well as a number of Late Archaic types common in
Central Texasâsuch as Bulverde, Darl, Ensor, Marcos, Marshall, Montell, and Pedernalesâand
a variety of probable Late Archaic forms more characteristic of the northern and eastern parts of
the state such as Carrollton, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, and Kent (Yedlowski et al. 1998). Noting
the relatively high frequency of Late Archaic projectile points, Yedlowski et al. (1998) suggest an
increased regional use by hunter-gatherers as a result of moister climatic conditions than before,
presumably associated with greater productivity in subsistence resources. They also note that,
although the projectile point evidence indicates interaction with groups living in Central Texas
proper, larger proportions of points indicate affinities with eastern Texas than during the Early
and Middle Archaic.
Brown (1987:44-22 through 44-26) presents similar conclusions concerning an increase in
occupational intensity and increased interaction for those project areas at the eastern edge of the
region (i.e., Cedar Creek Reservoir in southeastern Kaufman County and Richland-Chambers
Reservoir in southeastern Navarro County). Two of the three excavated sites at Cedar Creek
Reservoir have strong Late Archaic components represented by numerous Gary points and a
variety of other lithic tools (Story 1965), and at least 15 sites at Richland-Chambers Reservoir
have identifiable components of this age. In addition to constellations of projectile point styles
(e.g., Dawson, Gary, Godley, Kent, and Yarbrough) that indicate ties more to the north and east
than to the south and west, each of these areas has yielded information suggesting that ceramics
may have been introduced into the material culture of local groups during the latest part of the
Late Archaic, as they were across most of Texas to the east (where this interval usually is called
the Early Ceramic period, and sometimes the Woodland period).
10

At Cedar Creek Reservoir, there are hints in the distributional data from the Lacy and Gossett
Bottoms sites that the initial use of ceramic containers preceded introduction of the bow and
arrow, although it is difficult to be certain because the sites were not well stratified and the sherds
could not be related to known early types such as Williams Plain (Story 1965). At RichlandChambers Reservoir, distinctive shell-tempered sherds were recovered from contexts dated
between A.D. 200 and 700 at the Adams Ranch site (Bruseth and Martin 1987), apparently
representing the earliest ceramic industry in this part of the Trinity River basin.
The most complete picture of the archaeology of the Late Archaic for this region comes from the
Oak Woodlands at the eastern margin of the Blackland Prairie. Along Richland and Chambers
creeks, Late Archaic groups appear to have been hunter-gatherers whose subsistence pursuits
focused on wild plant foods such as hickory nuts and prairie turnips, and faunal taxa such as deer,
turtles, small mammals, birds, and fish (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Although presumably not
sedentary, these groups clearly used the area in an intensive fashion for residential purposes, and
it appears that populations increased while territory sizes decreased. A conspicuous component
of the record are the so-called âWylie pits,â which are large man-made depressions measuring
approximately 16 m in diameter and 0.61 m in depth, excavated at the Bird Point Island and
Adams Ranch sites. These were large features that appear to have been used for communal
processing of vegetal resources (and later as cemeteries), perhaps in the context of band
aggregation in âtension zonesâ as territories decreased in size (McGregor and Bruseth 1987).
Human burials are common in the archaeological record of the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods of at least the eastern part of Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1993). Some of these burials are
associated with Wylie pit features. These features were first identified at a series of sites along
the East Fork of the Trinity River and were considered an important trait of the Wylie focus
(Harris and Suhm 1963; Stephenson 1952; Wilson 1946). Radiocarbon assays from pits at the
Upper Rockwall and Sister Grove Creek sites in the Lavon Lake area suggest that the pits and the
Wylie focus were associated with the Late Prehistoric period (Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Lynott
(1977) widened the temporal span by incorporating a Late Archaic phase into the focus
definition. Subsequent work on Wylie pits at Richland-Chambers Reservoir to the south
confirmed their Late Archaic age (Bruseth and Martin 1987). Nonetheless, the wide range of
associated artifact types and the long time span represented by the pits made it clear that the
Wylie focus was not a useful construct. Bruseth and Martin (1987), while discarding the focus as
unusable, further supported Lynottâs (1975) original interpretation of the pits as being associated
with large-scale food processing. Their interpretation equates the pits to the burned rock middens
of Central Texas, with both representing group aggregations.

Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700â1600) is marked by the initial appearance of arrow
points. The A.D. 700 date for the start of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar
material in the Brazos River drainage to the west. Group aggregation and large-scale
manipulation of subsistence resources, as represented by the Wylie pits and the human burials
they contain, may be indicative of societal changes that continued through the Late Prehistoric
period. Habitation structures indicating increased sedentism, at least in certain places and at
certain times, have been found in some Late Prehistoric sites along with cultigens, such as corn,
and arrow points and ceramics indicating important technological changes. Also, there may be
evidence (e.g., the distinction between burials placed inside and outside Wylie pits) of differential
11

mortuary practices that could reflect a shift toward a hierarchical social structure, although this
evidence is nowhere near as strong as that for the Caddo area of northeast Texas. Both Lynott
(1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period be divided into an early
and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging subsistence system
of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting Southern Plains influences.
Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this period (Harris and
Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
Prikrylâs (1990, 1993) Late Prehistoric I period (A.D. 700â1200) is marked by the Alba, Bonham,
Catahoula, Scallorn, and Steiner arrow point types. Ceramic vessels are mostly grog-tempered
and undecorated, but some evidence indicates influences from other regions in some locally
manufactured wares displaying designs similar to those associated with East Texas Caddoan
ceramic types. Evidence for corn and structures has been found at sites at Joe Pool Lake in
western Dallas County as well as to the north at Hubert Moss Lake near the Red River (Lorrain
1969; Martin 1994; Peter and McGregor 1988). Farther west, cultural changes also were taking
place on the Rolling Plains, though this area held onto its Archaic lifestyle even after
technological innovations such as the bow and arrow were accepted (Lynott 1981).
As a result of intensive excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake, Peter and
McGregor (1988) proposed a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site
yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn
cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late
twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an
intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have
occurred, in at least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also
likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
Concerning the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarize the results of that research as follows:
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic
sites which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only
ones in the project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500â650 yr. bp. No
evidence of horticulture was recovered, and the [Late Prehistoric II] fauna indicate a foraging
strategy that emphasized deer procurement and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation
of chert raw materials was about as frequent as in the [Late Archaic], and long-distance raw
material acquisition (e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated
by locally produced shell-tempered wares, which by this time were being produced in the
Southern Plains region generally. As recorded by previous synthesis (Story 1990) little if any
interaction with the Caddoan area is indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts prehistoric data suggest that
regional traditions emerged at the end of the [Late Prehistoric] period largely independent of the
Plains or East Texas Woodlands.

More recently, McGregor (personal communication 1999) has argued strongly for a âmiddle
subperiodâ of the Late Prehistoric that he dates between A.D. 1000 and 1350. He believes that
arrow points with straight or rectangular stems are most diagnostic of this period and identifies
three sites or site areas with relatively clean (or minimally mixed) components of this middle
subperiodâthe Cobb-Pool site, Area B at the McDonald site (41HI105) on Hackberry Creek on
the middle Brazos River drainage, and Area F at the Haleyâs Point site (34MA15) on the Red
River (Brown et al. 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988; Rohn 1998). McGregor also notes that
12

maize is common at Haleyâs Point, as it is at Cobb-Pool, and suggests that these sites are
representative of a relatively short-lived, region-wide subsistence pattern involving a partial
dependence on agriculture during this middle subperiod (McGregor, personal communication
1999).
Sites dating to the Late Prehistoric period broadly defined, in other words after ca. A.D. 700, also
are common downstream on the Trinity area of the Blackland Prairie. The collections studied
during the Superconducting Super Collider project contain substantial numbers of both early
(e.g., Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Colbert, Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz)
arrow points, but Yedlowski et al. (1998) note that early arrow points are more frequent, perhaps
reflecting high population densities continuing from the Late Archaic period. Other than the
Perdiz and Scallorn types, which have such widespread distributions, the arrow styles point to the
east and north. The limited ceramic samples, containing sherds reminiscent of types such as
Weches Fingernail Impressed, Killough Pinched, Maydelle Incised, and Poyner Engraved, also
support interaction with Caddoan groups to the east (Yedlowski et al. 1998). The Strawn Creek
site at Navarro Mills Reservoir presents a similar picture, with most of the typed arrow points
dating to the first half of the Late Prehistoric period and the more distinctive ceramics in the small
collection relating to the early Caddoan types, Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Weches
Fingernail Impressed (Duffield 1963). The Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir also yielded
numerous early arrow points, as well as a respectable number of Perdiz points, along with a small
collection of highly fragmented sherds (Sorrow et al. 1966).
Three sites excavated at Cedar Creek Reservoir contained Late Prehistoric components, although
materials of this age were common only at the Gossett Bottoms and Lacy sites (Story 1965).
Early arrow point forms (e.g., Alba, Catahoula, Friley, Granbury, Scallorn, and Steiner) are better
represented than late ones (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz), but not by much. Not surprisingly, ceramics
are more frequent in this area than to the west and clearly are related to the Caddoan tradition to
the east and northeast; some of the more distinctive decorated sherds were considered reminiscent
of types such as Canton Incised, Killough Pinched, and Ripley or Wilder Engraved (Story 1965).
The faunal remains, many of which probably relate to Late Prehistoric occupations, from the
Gossett Bottoms and Lacy sites consist predominantly of deer, turtle, and small mammals, with
bison occurring only in small numbers. Based on the feature evidence (or lack thereof), it appears
that this part of the Trinity basin was occupied by mobile hunter-gatherers rather than sedentary
groups during the Late Prehistoric period.
Some of the best data concerning Native American use of the region during the Late Prehistoric
period is from Richland-Chambers Reservoir. Sites dating to this interval are common at the
reservoir, especially for the early half of the period, and it appears that there was a significant
decline in population densities after about A.D. 1300 (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The data
suggest that most of the excavated sites with Late Prehistoric components were used for
residential purposes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987), although there are some sites, for example the
stream-side concentrations of mussel shells and artifacts at 41FT193 and 41NV139, that probably
were used in a more limited fashion. The house patterns at the Bird Point Island site point to
intensive use by sedentary hunter-gatherers during the first half of the period, and other
components that are contemporaneous, slightly earlier, or later (e.g., at Bird Point Island, Adams
Ranch, Irvine, and Little Cedar Creek) have middens and numerous features suggesting intensive
use but no houses. These components may represent occupations that were seasonal in length.
Macrobotanical remains point to use primarily of wild plant foods such as hardwood nuts, a
variety of seeds, and tubers/rhizomes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The only tropical cultigen is
13

maize, and it occurs in very small quantities only in contexts dating to the last half of the period.
Hence, groups who lived in this area were predominantly hunters and gatherers. The arrow
points that characterize the early and late parts of the periodâAlba, Scallorn, and Steiner vs.
Perdiz and Clifftonâare the same styles as found elsewhere across the area, and it appears that
Gary dart points may have continued to be used through the early Late Prehistoric (McGregor and
Bruseth 1987:183). Ceramics are moderately common and clearly relate to Caddoan wares, with
most of the identified types (e.g., Maydelle Incised, Poyner Engraved, and Weches Fingernail
Impressed) indicating contact with groups in the Neches River drainage, east of the Trinity.
During the Late Prehistoric II period (A.D. 1200â1600), influences from the Southern Plains
became pronounced in the Cross Timbers and prairie areas. These influences coincided with an
increase in bison herd size in Northcentral Texas (Lynott 1981; Prikryl 1990). Bison was
important to subsistence, but shrinking procurement territory sizes due to population increases
continued the trend toward horticulture and settled village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris
and Morris 1970). In terms of technology, a Plains Indian tool assemblage was common (Prikryl
1990). Items associated with this assemblage include calcareous-tempered ceramic vessels, some
of which fit the description for the type Nocona Plain (shell-tempered), and unstemmed triangular
arrow points such as Fresno, Harrell, Maud, Perdiz, and Washita points. Tools specific to bison
processing include snub-nosed or thumbnail scrapers and edge-beveled Harahey knives. Bison
scapula hoes, which also are common in Plains Indian sites, have been recovered from sites in the
Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake areas of Denton and Collin counties (Barber 1969; Harris 1945).
The Plains Indian influences associated with settled village life were used to define the Henrietta
complex of Northcentral Texas. This complex, based on Kriegerâs (1946) more expansive
Henrietta focus, extends from the Red River south along the headwaters of the Trinity and Brazos
rivers. The type-site, M. D. Harrell, is located along the Brazos River in Young County just
northwest of Palo Pinto County in the drainage basin for Possum Kingdom Reservoir (Krieger
1946). The Harrell site and other associated sites contain middens, house structures, rock hearths,
storage pits, and burials, and they most often are located on sandy knolls or terraces overlooking
river valleys (Brooks 1989; Forrester 1994). Excavated sites attributed to the Henrietta complex
include the Coyote and Glass sites located on the Red River in Montague County (Lorrain 1967;
Woodall 1967a), and it is clear that sites such as Dillard in Cooke County are related as well
(Martin 1994).
The Henrietta complex as an investigative tool can be limiting since its loose definition tends to
obscure local differences. More recent investigations in the upper Trinity River drainage have
tended to highlight the local differences. At Ray Roberts Reservoir, for instance, Ferring and
Yates (1997) see local trends emerging independent of extraregional influences. They cite the
lack of evidence for extensive maize horticulture and the preponderance of short-term logistical
camps as the basis of their hypothesis. Similarly, Peter and McGregor (1988) demonstrated that
occupation of the Mountain Creek drainage was less intensive in the Late Prehistoric II period
than before and that maize horticulture, if practiced at all, was limited. The adaptation
developing in Northcentral Texas after A.D. 1200 was truly distinctive from the Plains adaptations
revealed to the northwest in Foard County (Peter et al. 1997).

Protohistoric/Historic Native American
The cultural divergences between Northcentral and Northeast Texas that began in the Archaic
period continued into the Protohistoric and Historic periods. Various sociological factors, not the
least of which was the colonization of New Mexico by the Spanish, caused drastic changes in the
cultural makeup of Northcentral Texas, as groups from elsewhere migrated into the area and
existing groups were forced to adapt to their presence. Meanwhile, Caddoan groups continued to
dominate the Northeastern portion of the state, although significant changes were occurring there
also.
Prior to Spanish settlement of New Mexico in 1598, European presence in Texas was sporadic at
best. After 1598, however, Spanish influence was never absent from the Southern Plains,
although actual contact with Europeans continued to be limited and only brief records of journeys
into or through the North Texas area exist (Hofman et al. 1989; John 1975).
By the eighteenth century, immigrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond North
Texas, and their documentation by traders and explorers marks the start of the Historic period
(A.D. 1600â1860; Prikryl 1993). Unfortunately, because reliable historical documentation is very
sparse for the upper Trinity River basin during the early Historic period, it is not clear which
specific aboriginal groups were residing in the present-day region at the beginning of this period.
What is clear is that the early Historic era in North Texas was a time of population fluctuation,
movement, and amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993).
Documentary sources suggest that the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai, Yojaune,
Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo traversed the region at various times during the period
(Campbell 1983; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982). Prior to about A.D. 1725â
1750, Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains,
known as the High Plains. After that time, the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche
and Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the
Lower Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967;
Hofman 1989b:91).
Available data suggest that many of the aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of the Great
Plains, including North Texas, were Caddoan language speakers, from the Arikara in the north to
the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested
that the Socoatino, encountered by the survivors of the Hernando de Soto expedition in the
sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and were the same as the Canohatino, identified by the
French in the latter part of the seventeenth century, apparently located at that time âon the
Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San
Antonio, Austin, and Wacoâ (Newcomb 1993:24). However, if the prehistoric occupants of the
eastern margin of the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they
were absorbed very early by other Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai,
Tawakoni, Taovaya, Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in Northcentral Texas in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form
the Historic period Wichita Tribe. Some, however, were probably absorbed by the united Caddo
tribes, and some may even have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such as the
Tonkawa, during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

15

The term âWichitaâ is commonly used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including
the Wichita, Taovaya, Tawakoni, Iscani, Waco, and Kichai. Many of these groups apparently
entered the Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern
Nebraska, to escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita
were true Plains Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and
bison hunting. They occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which
they conducted semi-nomadic bison hunts. In 1719, their villages were located along the
Arkansas River in northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of
their villages to southern Oklahoma, along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end
of the Sabine and Neches rivers in Texas and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper
Brazos rivers. In 1759, the Taovaya village on the Red River was attacked by Diego Ortiz
Parrilla, but was successfully defended. In 1772, the year the Taovaya concluded a nominal
peace with the Spanish, one of their villages was on the Salt Fork of the Brazos, on the Lower
Plains west of present-day Dallas/Fort Worth (John 1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll 1952:2:705).
Wichita groups were included in treaties made with the Republic of Texas in 1843 and with the
United States in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:709). In Texas, they continued to live
between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until 1855. In that year, the Tawakoni and Waco
were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south of Fort Belknap, in company with a number
of other Native American remnant groups (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:212, 2:905).
Subsequently, as a result of increasing animosity from white settlers, they were removed to Indian
Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita
moved to Kansas during the Civil War, but returned to Oklahoma after the war to settle
permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman 1989b:95).
Although archaeological sites that can be associated definitely with various Historic period
groups are few, sites attributable to the Historic period Wichita have been identified at the edges
of Northcentral Texas. Among these is the Stansbury site (located in Hill County), but now
inundated by Lake Whitney (Stephenson 1970). Excavations at the site produced burials, house
structures, storage pits, and a variety of aboriginal artifacts along with European ceramics, glass
beads, metal arrow points, and flintlock musket parts. A cluster of Wichita sites also occurs to
the north along the Red River in Montague County. These sites are known collectively as
âSpanish Fortâ and occur on both the Oklahoma and Texas sides of the river. Woodall (1967b)
excavated one of these sites, named the Upper Tucker site. The site produced artifacts and
features similar to those discovered at the Stansbury site. Wichita sites on both the Brazos and
Red rivers were located atop high terraces overlooking the rivers. Within the upper Trinity River
basin, little evidence of these Historic period Indian groups has been found, with the exception of
a few Native American sites with European items (Sollberger 1953).
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern
Plains became commonplace. This was the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the
Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north, and the acquisition of the Louisiana
Territory by the United States in 1803.

Historic European and Euro-American Cultural Period
The initial European penetration into the general area of North Texas occurred in the middle of
the sixteenth century (around 1542) when the survivors of the Hernando de Soto entrada, led by
LuÃ­s de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered Texas in their attempt to reach New Spain by land
16

(Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). Moscosoâs exact route is unknown, but
archaeological studies indicate that he apparently traversed the Red River valley somewhere
between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas. The party crossed the Red
River and journeyed through Northcentral Texas to present-day Wichita Falls before returning to
the Mississippi River to travel to the Gulf of Mexico. Recent reconstructions of the Moscoso
route through Texas (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991) equate the province of âNaguatexâ with the
Hatchel-Mitchell-Moores site complex in northern Bowie County, suggesting that from here the
entrada moved southwest through current Bowie County to cross the Sulphur River somewhere
in the vicinity of present-day Douglassville, where Wright Patman Lake is located.
In the late 1600s, the Spanish introduced the first of their missions into East Texas. The goal of
these missions was to eradicate the indigenous religions and to Christianize the native
populations. In 1690 the Spanish established missionsâSan Francisco de los Tejas and
SantÃ­simo Nombre de MarÃ­aâin the Hasinai area but abandoned them in 1693 when the local
population refused to comply with Spanish attempts to convert and control them (Swanton
1942:46â49).
The French, led by RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, first intruded into eastern Texas by
establishing Fort Saint Louis in 1685 (John 1975:182), and in 1714 Juchereau de St. Denis set up
a trading post at Natchitoches (in present-day Louisiana). Spanish fear of an increased French
presence in Texas led to the decision in 1716 to try again to establish a series of missions and
presidios in East Texasâthis time a second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas near the Neches
River, Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n (later moved to the San Antonio area in 1731)
on the Angelina River, the Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe at present-day Nacogdoches, San Jose
de los Nazonis in present-day Nacogdoches County, and Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Ais near presentday San Augustine, as well as San Miguel de Lineares de los Adaes in present-day Louisianaâas
a buffer against further French encroachment into that region (Cooper et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28;
Swanton 1942:46â49). When France and Spain went to war, the French at Natchitoches attacked
the Spanish settlement of Los Adaes, forcing the Spanish to abandon the area once again
(Newcomb 1961:288). After the truce in 1721, the Spanish representative Marques de Aguayo
persuaded the French to withdraw from Texas. He reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes
as the capital of the Province of Texas. After briefly regaining control of the area, the French
sold it as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.
In the Red River area, the French established Le Poste des Cadodaquious in present-day Bowie
County in 1719 and explored what is now Franklin County (Harper 2002). BÃ©nard de la Harpeâs
1719 trading post (which became known as the Nassonite Post) on the Red River north of
present-day Texarkana was the first European settlement in the Great Bend (Cooper et al. 2003;
Kelley and Coxe 1996:21). Another effort by Spain to curb French influence occurred in 1760,
when Fray JosÃ© Francisco de Calahorra y Saenz led an expedition to present-day Rains County to
make peace with the Native American tribes in Northcentral Texas. These trading posts
eventually served as illicit trading centers between the two European colonies: modern-day
archaeological investigations have yielded artifacts of both Spanish and French origin that would
suggest that the different cultures interacted at the trading sites.
Following the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into
North Texas intensified, although for a number of years it was not clear who actually owned the
area south of the Red River. The United States considered the area (and indeed, most of Texas)
to be part of the Louisiana Purchase and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe
17

1939). Spain (and later Mexico), on the other hand, was violently opposed to this view, and at
several times during the first few decades of the nineteenth century, the dispute nearly led to war
(Smith 1991). The first official Anglo-American penetration of the region was by the 1806
Freeman-Custis Expedition, which was turned back at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a
Spanish military force (Flores 1984).
Despite Spainâs claim, North Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the AngloAmerican sphere of influence, and settlement continued. The earliest settlements were confined
to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the
prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Trammelâs Trace and Daytonâs Road.
Trammelâs Trace, a popular immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur River at
Eppersonâs Ferry and continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs, founded
in 1839, and then south to cross Cypress Creek 2 miles west of modern-day Jefferson (Webb and
Carroll 1952:2:793â794). Daytonâs Road was a major eastâwest overland route that ran along the
divide between the Sulphur and Red rivers.
The original Anglo-American settlers in Texas were largely subsistence farmers residing on small
holdings, with an economy based on grain and livestock production (Peter and Cliff 1990:36).
The commercial production of cotton apparently was not introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach
1968), a shift that was accompanied by increasing numbers of slaves in the region. The town of
Jefferson, on Cypress Creek, was a major cotton market, and the antebellum planters throughout
the region undoubtedly sent their cotton there for sale (Peter and Cliff 1990:39). Other major
industries established about the same time included tan yards and syrup mills; after 1857, railroad
construction also progressed westward (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198, 2:59).
As settlers began to move into Texas, they remained under first Spanish and then Mexican control
until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. For the most part, North Texas was beyond
the direct sphere of the conflict involving the fight for Texas independence: that conflict played
out primarily in South and Central Texas in 1835 and 1836. The most significant change
thereafter involved decrees by President Mirabeau Lamar, the second president of Texas, to make
the settlers of the Texas Republic safe from marauding Native Americans by adopting an Indian
removal or extermination program. Active efforts to drive off or exterminate the Native
Americans in North Texas had been under way for some time. In one instance in 1837, a group
of Texas Rangers under the command of Lt. A. B. Van Benthuysen camped on Turtle Creek after
conducting raids on Indians to the north (Maxwell 2008). Subsequently, many native groups who
used the Trinity River basin relocated north of the Red River.
Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood in 1846, entering the Union as the twenty-eighth
state, but did not remain a U.S. state for long. Sectarian politics were raised to a fever pitch
during that period, and after the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession.
The sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of North Texas lay with the secessionist
southerners because of several reasons: a majority of them had immigrated from the South, the
region as a whole had a substantial slave population, and the cash economy of the area was built
on slave-based agriculture, even though most of the individual farmers could not afford to own
slaves. In most of Northeast and Northcentral Texas anti-Union feelings ran high (Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:306). Although some counties (e.g., Delta) did support Sam Houstonâs Unionist
forces during the early part of the war, Texas eventually became a part of the Confederate States
of America (McCroskey 1997).

18

Although the fighting never reached North Texas, the Civil War still inflicted hardships on the
region (Works Projects Administration [WPA] 1992:55â58). The war made it difficult to import
manufactured goods into the region, and the economic woes of the Confederacy led to such
severe inflation that residents could not purchase products even when they were available. In
addition, the withdrawal of fighting men from the region contributed to the eastward retreat of the
frontier and thus to increasing fears of Native American attacks (Maxwell 2008).
Simultaneously, the region also experienced considerable immigration of Southerners who were
moving west to escape the warfare that ravaged the Deep South. The region gradually became
impoverished, when food and other commodities became more expensive and difficult to obtain
as the war progressed (WPA 1992:55â58).
The state re-entered the Union in 1865, and railroad networks began changing economic
relationships throughout the state. After 1870, the population of North Texas began to increase,
and the region began to recover from the worst effects of the war and recession. One of the most
important factors in this recovery was the increasing role of the railroad in the regional economy.
A small amount of railroad construction had occurred prior to the outbreak of the war, when more
than 50 miles of track had been laid westward from Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El Paso,
and Pacific Railroad. After a postwar hiatus of four years, construction resumed at a steady rate
for the next several decades. In the area around Dallas, where the railroads arrived in 1872 with
the opening of the northâsouth Houston and Texas Central, the new transportation network
brought changes in land use, the economy, and community development. One year later, the
Texas and Pacific Railway, running eastâwest, intersected with the Houston and Texas Central.
The railroads enabled long-distance export of local agricultural products while bringing in
building supplies and mechanized farm implements to county residents, thus promoting both rural
and town economies. The railroads also had dramatic effects on land use, community
development, and demographics, driving the establishment and abandonment of towns around the
state (Maxwell 2008).
After the introduction of the railroad, cotton and wheat production formed the backbone of
agriculture (Odom 2001), but other crops included hay, corn, oats, and sugar. By 1910 a majority
of farmers were tenants (Green 1977:Table 8.16), many of whom were trapped in a cycle of debt
to the landowners (Ferring and Reese 1982). Manufacturing, however, was taking hold, shifting
the economy of the Dallas area away from agriculture; by 1920, 492 manufacturing plants
employed nearly 9,000 people. At that time, 70 percent of Dallas Countyâs population resided in
Dallas, Oak Cliff, Carrollton, Lancaster, Garland, Grand Prairie, Mesquite, and Richardson
(Maxwell 2008).
Rural populations began to decline during the 1930s under the impetus of poor climatic
conditions, hard times, the decreased importance of cotton as a cash crop, and the increasing level
of mechanization in agriculture (Lebo 1995). After a mid-century decline, however, light
industry, retail, and service opportunities reconfigured local economies. The Dallas-Fort Worth
metroplex has undergone astronomical growth, particularly in its northern suburbs; the current
population of Garland, for example, is over 140 times the cityâs 1970 population (North Central
Texas Council of Governments 2009).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH AT SITE 41DL203
Following its initial identification in the 1980s by researchers from Southern Methodist
University, site 41DL203 was first systematically investigated by Hicks & Co. in 2006 (Feit and
Stotts 2006). The cultural resources survey of the project area at that time consisted of a
combination of both shovel tests and trackhoe trenches (Feit and Stotts 2006). Eleven shovel
tests were excavated along four eastâwest transects between the relict and modern channels of
Rowlett Creek, and six trackhoe trenches were randomly placed throughout the project area.
Shovel tests were excavated to depths of 100 cm, but none yielded cultural artifacts. Soils
encountered during shovel testing were uniformly described as very dark grayish brown, damp,
sticky clay with no inclusions (Feit and Stotts 2006:24). However, all of the six excavated
trackhoe trenches were positive for mussel shell and faunal bone, and three (Trenches 2, 3, and 5)
contained evidence of burned earth and charcoal. This material was found within two stratified
components evident within the project area, one at approximately 130â140 cm below ground
surface and the other at approximately 160â180 cm below ground surface (Feit and Stotts
2006:33). Given the possible multicomponent nature of the site and its potential for addressing
prehistoric resource use and seasonality, site 41DL203 was recommended for further testing to
determine NRHP eligibility. Testing was recommended in the form of mechanical stripping of
the upper meter of soil, followed by hand-dug excavation units (Feit and Stotts 2006:33).
Geo-Marine conducted test excavations at 41DL203 in 2007 and 2008 to establish site integrity,
morphology, age, and National Register eligibility under 36 CFR Â§ 60.4, Criterion D, of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000, and under
equivalent criteria provided by 13 TAC 26.8 of the Texas Antiquities Code. The testing
proceeded in three separate stages: (1) excavation of 30 trackhoe trenches (THTs) to search for
artifact materials and to understand the geomorphic context of the site location, (2) excavation of
a series of six 0.5-x-0.5-m and eight 1-x-1-m controlled hand-dug test units to sample the
diversity of materials relative to the kinds of items observed in mechanical trenching, and (3)
expansion of as many as two of the original 1-x-1-m test units to 2-x-2-m test units. The
expansion of a third 1-x-1-m test unit to the 2-x-2-m dimension was also authorized by TxDOT
ENV, in the event that further testing might have the potential to contribute to the evaluation of
the site for listing in the NRHP.
Geo-Marine National Register testing at 41DL203âdescribed more fully in Chapter 5â
recovered a total of 7,249 artifacts, consisting of 501 lithics, 444 pieces of fire-cracked rock,
1,465 mussel shell fragments, and 4,839 bone fragments. Most of these materialsânearly 90
percentâwere found in TUs A1, B5, and D2 and the associated 2-x-2-m expansions (TUs A1B,
B5B, and D2B). These concentrations of cultural material and the stratified nature of the
deposits, particularly in units B5 and B5B, led Geo-Marine investigators to conclude that site
41DL203 was eligible for the NRHP and to recommend data recovery via block excavation of the
B5/B5B area. The results of the block excavation are described in Chapter 6.
There are no other identified prehistoric archaeological sites within 1.6 km (1 mi) of 41DL203.
Just outside this radius at 2 km to the northwest, site 41DL417 was identified by PBS&J
investigators in 2002 and has intriguing parallels to 41DL203 (Sills and Cliff 2003). Site
41DL417 was recorded based on the discovery of lithics, fire-cracked rock, baked clay, animal
bones, mussel shell, and burned macrobotanical remains in a backhoe trench. Sills and Cliff
(2003) report the depth of the site as approximately 3 m and provide a 2-sigma calibrated
radiocarbon date range of 110â370 B.C., placing the occupation securely within the Late Archaic
20

period. The current status of the site, which Sills and Cliff (2003) evaluated as potentially
eligible for the NRHP, is unknown. Future research at 41DL417 may provide a useful
complement to the data from 41DL203. The former does not appear to contain stratified evidence
of repeated occupations comparable to that found at 41DL203. Still, based on the documentation
available, the single occupation at 41DL417 appears to have been well preserved as of 2002, with
the presence of macrobotanical remains and ash, extremely fragile materials found only in
minimal quantities in the active near-channel environment of 41DL203 (see Chapters 6 and 7 of
the present volume).

CHAPTER 4
RESEARCH METHODS
by Clayton M. Tinsley

Archaeological testing and data recovery excavations at site 41DL203 were carried out according
to field and laboratory protocols approved by THC, TxDOT ENV, and NTTA. All fieldwork was
carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4695, both before and after its modification in
September 2008.

RESEARCH FOCI
In 1993, Nancy Kenmotsu and Timothy Perttulaâs edited volume, Archeology in the Eastern
Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document, was inspired in part by regional syntheses (e.g.,
Hofman et al. 1989; Story et al. 1990) commissioned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The
papers in Kenmotsu and Perttulaâs volume provide a regionally coherent research design to query,
build upon, and perhaps move beyond the prehistoric cultural frameworks dominant in
Northcentral Texas, as reviewed at the beginning of this chapter (Peter and McGregor 1988;
Prikryl 1987, 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). Recent criticism (Barrett 2009) of Texas
archaeologistsâ reliance on 20-year-old publications does have merit, but the fact remains that
these sources remain highly relevant to problem-oriented archaeological research in the study
area. Although great strides have been made in the archaeology of other parts of the stateâfor
instance, the Caddo area to the east (e.g., Perttula 2004) or the Caprock Canyonlands to the west
(e.g., Boyd 2004a)ârelatively little large-scale, synthetic, or problem-driven work has been done
in Northcentral Texas since that reported in the influential sources above. Investigators in this
area have only recently begun to address longstanding lacunae by focusing on stratified sites
(Burson et al. 2000; Lintz et al. 2004; Peter et al. 2002; Pleasant and Naumann 2007).
With this larger research context in mind, preliminary testing data from 41DL203 allowed GeoMarine investigators to identify five major themes from the Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993)
volume to which excavations at the site might contribute: paleoenvironment, chronology,
subsistence, settlement patterns, and exchange (Fields and Tomka 1993; Perttula et al. 1993).
Although parsed for discussion, these themes are interacting parts of any prehistoric society and
as such need to be integrated and contextualized in both time and space. Commonly, huntergatherer theories (e.g., variants of Optimal Foraging models; Binford 1980; Dyson-Hudson and
Smith 1978; Kelly 1995) are utilized in research projects as a way of contextualizing multisite
23

data sets in an effort to study themes such as those listed above. The utility of such models in the
analysis of single-site data sets is limited and alternative approaches are needed. Historical
ecology is presented as a theoretical alternative to help understand past human/environmental
interactions represented by the archaeology of 41DL203.

Historical Ecology
As an explanatory factor in human social behavior, history and contingency-based paradigms
have seen their popularity rise and fall since anthropologyâs beginning. Currently, history is
being joined with ecology in an attempt to better understand past human/environmental
interactions and their often-unpredictable consequences. The volume Historical Ecology:
Cultural Knowledge and Changing Landscapes edited by Carole Crumley (1994) was
instrumental in helping formulate a working set of assumptions regarding humans and their
natural environment. The volume built upon a long but varied legacy of ecological anthropology
and in many ways offered little new to social scientists. However, the Historical Ecology volume
was invaluable in bringing new attention to the endeavor of human/environmental history. Since
the inception of Crumleyâs edited volume, human/environment contingency-based perspectives
have increased in number and refinement as evidenced by the recent American Anthropologist âIn
Focusâ collection of papers (Fisher and Feinman 2005).
Dissatisfaction with neofunctional and structural-functional explanations in the 1970s and 1980s
ushered in a period of critiques that began to question many long-held assumptions of existing
anthropological theory. Headland (1997:605) reviews a series of âmythsâ from this period: the
ecologically noble savage, pristine forests, the idealization of primitivity, the belief in wild food
abundance, and the concept of a steady-state equilibrium between society and the environment.
Many ahistorical and systems-based neofunctional works (e.g., Binford 1980; Dyson-Hudson and
Smith 1978; Jochim 1976; Kelly 1995; Plog 1974) are contingent upon such âmyths.â
Human/nature interactions are at the core of historical ecology. A primary concern involves the
realization that past human activity has helped create environmental change at a range of scales
and temporal levels. Historical ecology has attempted to move away from earlier notions of strict
human/nature dichotomies and instead formulate more integrative concepts of humans imbedded
within environments (cf. Winterhalder 1994). Human systems are seen as both changing and
being changed by their natural environments. A solid commitment to history at various scales is
critical to understanding both the past as well as the present. For many, much of the focus of
historical study is on the actual landscape. For these researchers, the landscape acts as an
âadditive amalgamâ by representing the sum of all past natural and human modification (Fisher
and Feinman 2005:64). Studying the human-modified landscape allows researchers of nonliterate
societies a coarse-grained view of social and environmental transformations through time (Fisher
and Thurston 1999). Equilibrium-based models of human/nature interaction are seen as
simplistic and unrealistic. Winterhalder (1994:30) explains that organism analogies based on
static concepts of homeostasis âallow little analytical room to history.â
The âhistorical turnâ of anthropology in the 1980s had a profound and lasting effect on ecological
anthropology. Dissatisfaction with synchronic neofunctional approaches and the rejection of
simplistic static views of the past helped usher in a new interest in diachronic views of humans
and their natural environment. The Santa Fe conference and the Crumley (1994) volume that
followed helped unify and provide a nameââHistorical Ecologyââfor use by the various
24

anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians working within an ecological framework.
Important to historical ecology is the commitment of bringing together researchers from both the
natural and social sciences in studying past landscape/human interactions. A primary concern
involves the realization that past human activity has helped create environmental change on a
range of scales and temporal levels and this in turn has affected social systems.
Historical Ecology relies on interdisciplinary research efforts that make use of elements of
landscape ecology and archaeology in gathering past human and environmental data sets.
Commonly, botanical data (pollen, opal phytolith and charcoal) are collected both on and off-site
to determine plant use and vegetation modification through time (e.g. Burney 1999; Redman
1999). Zooarchaeological data in the form of archaeological faunal assemblages as well as
entomological samples (from floated soil samples) are also used to assess animal utilization,
environmental conditions and climate changes (cf. Elias 2006). In sum, a host of ecological
methods are unified with archaeological research to help better understand human/environmental
interactions and their ongoing interplay with human cultures.

FIELD METHODS

Testing Phase
The testing phase of archaeological research at 41DL203 consisted of two major stages: first, the
mechanical stripping of surface soil and sediments to expose the paleosol noted during previous
fieldwork (Feit and Stotts 2006), and second, the excavation by hand of 0.5-x-0.5-m, 1-x-1-m,
and 2-x-2-m units on the sides of the trenches.
Mechanical Trenching
Thirty trenches were excavated in the project area (Figure 2) by a trackhoe with a bucket
approximately 1 m in width. Nine trenches were placed outside the area bounded by the artificial
and natural channels of Rowlett Creek, but the majority of the trenches were placed within the
intrachannel area. Trenches measured approximately 4â6 m in length with gradually sloping or
stepped floors to allow for entry and egress. Each trench was flanked by 1-m-deep, 1.25-m-wide
safety benches per OSHA regulations and reached a total depth of 2.5 m in the central cut. All
mechanical trenching was carried out under the supervision of Geo-Marine personnel, who
monitored the excavated matrix for the presence of cultural materials.
Manual Excavation
To recover finer data, manual excavation units of varying dimensionsâ0.5-x-0.5 m, 1-x-1 m, and
2-x-2 mâwere placed on the sides of selected trackhoe trenches (Figure 2). To test whether site
41DL203 was bounded by the Rowlett Creek channels, six of the nine trenches placed outside the
channel area were selected for additional investigation via 0.5-x-0.5-m units. Of the 21 trenches
within the channel area, where the greatest concentrations of materials were noted during
trenching, eight were selected for additional investigation via 1-m-x-1-m units. Geo-Marine
archaeologists placed these units over cultural materials and features visible in the trench walls.
Three of the eight were later expanded to 2-x-2 m.
25

All hand units were excavated in 10-cm-thick levels using shovels and trowels to a total depth of
2.5 m below the original ground surface. All excavated matrix was screened onsite through
0.635-cm mesh hardware cloth. Animal bone, baked clay masses, lithic tools and debitage, firecracked rock, mussel shell fragments, and particularly large pieces of wood charcoal were
collected and delivered to the Geo-Marine laboratory in Plano, Texas. Field observations were
documented on standard Geo-Marine forms for each level within each unit, with separate forms
for each feature encountered.

Data Recovery Phase
As with the testing phase, the mitigation or data recovery phase at 41DL203 consisted of two
major stages. First, the surface soil and sediments were mechanically removed to expose the top
of the paleosol noted during previous fieldwork by Hicks and Co. (Feit and Stotts 2006) and
during Geo-Marineâs NRHP testing. The second stage consisted of the manual excavation of a 5m-x-5-m block within the stripped area to a total depth of 2.25 m below the original ground
surface (Figure 2).

Mechanical Stripping
A trackhoe with a bucket approximately 1 m in width was used to mechanically strip upper
deposits from the area selected for mitigation. The trackhoe operator performed horizontal
scrapes to remove approximately 20 cm at a time under the supervision of Geo-Marine
archaeologists, who observed that the paleosol and its associated concentrations of cultural
materials began at a shallower depth than expected. To avoid disturbing culturally relevant
layers, then, the stripping extended only to a depth of 0.5â0.7 m instead of the 1-m depth
discussed in the scope of work. The mechanical stripping extended horizontally at least 2 m
around all sides of the 5-m-x-5-m area

Manual Excavation
The 5-x-5-m data recovery area was placed diagonal to the cardinal directions so that its north
corner abutted the trackhoe trench and associated manual excavation unitâTHT B5 and test unit
B5B, respectivelyâfrom which the greatest concentrations of cultural materials were recovered
during the testing phase (Figure 3). The data recovery unit was designated B5C to fit within the
testing nomenclature. Within B5C, a grid of 25 1-x-1-m subunits was laid out. Given that the
results of the testing phase indicated that the most significant variations in the concentrations of
cultural materials were vertical, the B5C subunits were excavated in 5-cm-thick arbitrary levels to
capture high-resolution stratigraphic data. A builderâs level was used to maintain precision
during the removal of each 5-cm-thick increment of each 1-x-1-m square within the B5C block.
The level was set up over the same ground surface datum and at the same instrument height each
day to reduce the risk of error.

All excavated matrix was screened onsite through 0.635-cm mesh hardware cloth. Animal bone,
baked clay masses, lithic tools and debitage, fire-cracked rock, and mussel shell fragments were
collected from the screens. Due to its fragility, charcoal was not systematically collected from
the screens. Particularly large fragments (over approximately 1 cm in diameter or length) were
noted and collected in situ before removal of the matrix, but smaller flecks and chunks were
noted only. Field observations were documented on standard Geo-Marine forms for each 5-cm
level within each 1-x-1-m subunit of the 5-x-5-m block, with separate forms for each feature
encountered.
All recovered materials were bagged, labeled, and delivered to the Geo-Marine laboratory (see
Laboratory Procedures). In the laboratory, a field sample number was assigned to each excavated
context (for instance, one 5-cm level within a 1-x-1-m subunit, or half of a bisected feature), and
all materials associated with that context were inventoried.
All subunits within the B5C block were excavated to a final depth of 2.25 m beneath the original
ground surface. Due to the shallower-than-expected mechanical stripping mentioned above, the
volume of deposit excavated by hand within the contracted timeframe increased from 31.25 m3 to
approximately 41 m3. Flotation samples were collected from all features encountered, and also
from a continuous 30-x-30-cm column in 5-cm-thick levels corresponding to levels throughout
the rest of the block.

Geoarchaeology
Fieldwork for both the testing and data recovery phase included geoarchaeological study of the
exposed deposits. The various field and laboratory methods employed will be discussed briefly
here; more details of the geoarchaeological analyses are presented in Chapter 7.
The most fundamental geoarchaeological method used at 41DL203 was the creation of measured
profile drawings. During the testing phase, a subset of the mechanically excavated trenches was
described and photographed by the project geoarchaeologist. In most cases the end wall of the
trench was cleaned (usually with a pick mattock, knife, and trowel), and the deposits described.
A similar strategy was followed in the data recovery phase subsequent to hand excavation of the
B5C block. The deposits were described in general accordance with Schoeneberger et al. (2002)
with the exception that the fundamental unit of field observation was a âzone,â which was used to
represent any physically different deposit. All zones were subsequently assigned soil horizon
designations. The approximate age of the deposits examined in the field was inferred on the basis
of the degree of soil development in accordance with general principles outlined by Birkeland
(1999).
Geoarchaeological study of the fully excavated B5C block also included several analyses of a
continuous 10-x-10-cm column of sedimentâcollected adjacent to the 30-x-30-cm column
discussed aboveâas well as micromorphological examination of selected deposits. Collected in
5-cm levels to correspond to the rest of the B5C block, the 10-x-10-cm column samples were
processed in the laboratory to determine grain sizes represented, calcium carbonate content,
magnetic susceptibility, and microartifact inclusions, with the overall goal of illuminating
depositional and taphonomic processes. The project geoarchaeologist also collected blocks of
sediment from major depositional horizons and features of interest. These blocks were stabilized
in plastic resin, thin-sectioned, and examined in the laboratoryâvia digital scans and
30

microscopeâfor in-situ bedding and laminae, disturbance vectors, possible occupation surfaces,
and other features per Courty et al. (1989).
Subsequent to collection of all geoarchaeological samples, the B5C excavation block and
surrounding stripped area were mechanically backfilled under the supervision of Geo-Marine
personnel.

LABORATORY PROCEDURES
All cultural material recovered during both testing and data recovery was returned to the GeoMarine laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas, to be washed, weighed, counted, catalogued, and
labeled in compliance with Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) standards.
Context and attribute data for all materials were recorded in a Microsoft ACCESS database on an
IBM network system. The main categories of material recovered were animal bone, mussel shell,
baked clay masses, lithics, botanical samples (both flotation samples and opportunistically
collected wood charcoal), and fire-cracked rock. Animal bone, baked clay masses, and firecracked rock were analyzed in the Geo-Marine laboratory, while mussel shells, lithic tools and
debitage, and a subset of the botanical remains (selected wood charcoal samples) were sent to
external analysts. The following discussion describes analytical strategies and summarizes the
attributes recorded during the analysis of each class of material.

Faunal Remains
Measures of differential survivorship (i.e., taphonomy) were carried out on the faunal assemblage
as a whole and its temporal subdivisions, in order to assess human verses natural modifications to
bone surfaces. Every attempt was made to identify bone fragments to the highest taxonomic level
possible. Bone specimens not bearing diagnostic features but similar in size and other formal
characteristics were placed within specific size classes: small terrestrial mammal (STM),
medium terrestrial mammal (MTM), large terrestrial mammal (LTM), and very large terrestrial
mammal (VLTM). Assessments were also made of the following characteristics: bone element,
size/weight of fragment, fusion state, rodent gnawing, burning/butchery evidence, number of
identifiable specimens (NISP), and standard metric analyses (see Chapter 8).

Mussel
Molluscan specimens were counted using two quantitative units number of specimens (NSP;
[identified and unidentified]) and NISP. Because samples were small, minimum number of
individuals (MNI) was not calculated. All attempts were made to identify specimens to taxon and
element.

Gastropod
Small freshwater and land snail shells, which are nearly ubiquitous at floodplain archaeological
sites in Texas, were noted but not systematically collected. During the excavation of each 5-cm
level within each 1-x-1-m subunit of the data recovery block, archaeologists kept a rough count of
31

snail shells encountered. The totals were noted on level forms, divided into two categories:
âRabâ for Rabdotus sp., sometimes treated as a possible proxy indicator for human occupation,
and âFlatâ for the shells with a more planar spiral shape, primarily Helicina sp. Although snail
studies may have potential for illuminating paleoenvironment and subsistence regimes, the
immediate utility of such studies (from a cost-benefit perspective) have not yet been conclusively
demonstrated (see, e.g., Henry 1995), and the questions to be addressed seem to require different
collection strategies. If snails were collected and eaten by prehistoric populations, the larger ones
(e.g., exceeding 2 cm) were probably selected due to greater nutritional âbang for the buck.â On
the other end of the size spectrum, Brown (1999) argues that smaller snails (e.g., less than 0.3 cm)
are more susceptible to climate shifts and therefore more useful for reconstructing
paleoenvironment. Collecting such tiny snails from dense, saturated floodplain clays via fine
screens would present a significant logistical challenge and slow down the pace of work for an
uncertain benefit. Finally, treating snail (especially Rabdotus) presence as a general proxy
indicator for human occupation is itself problematic. On one hand, the trampled surfaces of an
occupied site are not conducive to snail survival, leading the archaeologist to expect higher
densities of snails in noncultural layers (Brown 1999). On the other hand, after a site is no longer
occupied, the organic material left by human activities may help drive plant growth and
associated snail populations, leading the archaeologist to expect higher densities of snails in
cultural layers (Brown 1999). Further research is needed to determine whether there is a useful
correlation between snail shell presence/absence and specific human subsistence activities or
human occupations in general. Overall, then, given this lack of clarity, the above notation on
field forms was considered sufficient data capture.

Chipped Stone Tools and Debitage
Steve Tomka of the University of Texas at San Antonio conducted an analysis of 100 percent of
the lithic cores and tools (originally estimated at 150 specimens), including projectile points and a
random sample of 75 percent of the more than 6,000 specimens of unmodified lithic debitage
recovered from general proveniences (see Chapter 9).
The analysis was to address the following themes:
a. Definition of lithic tools into functional categories and description of each functional
category with illustrations of representative samples.
b. Analysis of projectile points, definition of types, discussion of type groups, and illustration
of representative specimens.
c. Classification of lithic debitage into raw material categories and the analysis of basic
attributes (including dorsal cortex presence/absence, heating, size category).
Broader questions to be addressed were to include the following: (1) implications of tool and
debitage attributes for the lithic reduction process at 41DL203 (e.g., is tool/point production or
maintenance/reworking or a combination represented at the site? Are different processes
represented within different contexts?); and (2) implications of local versus nonlocal origin of
tools and debitage (e.g., raw material availability and procurement, and the potential range of
mobility and/or exchange).

32

Ground Stone Implements
Ground stone artifacts were weighed, measured, and photographed but not washed in order to
preserve potential residue surfaces.

Botanical Remains
All features encountered in the manual excavations were 100 percent bulk collected and floated to
recover charred and uncharred plant remains. In addition, to ensure that all excavated levels were
represented in the flotation, a complete 30-x-30-cm column was collected in 5-cm levels from the
southeast side of the B5C data recovery block. A standard oil-drum flotation apparatus with
upward water flowâsometimes called a Siraf systemâwas employed to separate material of
interest from extraneous matrix. The light fractionâin other words, charcoal fragments and other
buoyant objects scooped from the water surfaceâwas dried and then passed through 6.35
millimeter (mm) and 0.5 mm screens. The heavy fractionâin other words, material that sank to
the bottom of the apparatusâwas dried and passed through 6.35 mm and 1.6 mm screens.
Heavy-fraction objects larger than 6.35 mm were sorted into material classes (fire-cracked rock,
lithics, bone, etc.) and integrated into the corresponding collections from the excavations. Heavy
materials smaller than 6.35 mm were set aside for later discard, with the exception of bone
fragments and lithics, which were integrated into the appropriate assemblages with the larger
pieces.
The fine and coarse components of the light fraction material from each context were examined
by Geo-Marine personnel using hand lenses and microscopes as necessary. Although nearly 100
samplesâcontaining a total volume of approximately 1,000 liters (l) of sedimentâwere floated,
no botanical remains other than wood charcoal and modern rootlets were observed in the
preliminary examination. Professional examination of the wood charcoal was undertaken by Dr.
Susan Allen, and the identifications and their implications are discussed in Chapter 6.

Baked Clay
Irregular, gravel-sized masses of hardened clay, many with evidence of oxidation, reduction, or
smudging due to fire, were common in cultural levels in test units and in the data recovery block.
A basic analysis of these masses was performed in the Geo-Marine laboratory, where they were
separated by the presence or absence of plant impressions and insect burrows (see Chapter 6).
These categories were then subdivided into size classes: smaller than 0.5 inch (in; 12.7 mm),
0.5â1 in (12.7â25.4 mm), 1â1.5 in (25.4â38.1 mm), 1.5â2 in (38.1â50.8 mm), and larger than 2
in (50.8 mm). The cumulative weight and total number of baked clay masses within each class
and within each context were then recorded in the project ACCESS database.

Fire-Cracked Rock
Fire-cracked rock (FCR) was subjected to a similar basic analysis in the Geo-Marine laboratory.
Fragments were first sorted based by rock material type (e.g., sandstone, limestone, quartzite),
and any direct evidence of heating (e.g., fracture pattern, discoloration) noted (see Chapter 6).
Within material types, the FCR was then sorted into size classes: smaller than 0.5 in (12.7 mm),
33

0.5â1 in (12.7â25.4 mm), 1â1.5 in (25.4â38.1 mm), 1.5â2 in (38.1â50.8 mm), 2â4 in (50.8â101.6
mm), 4â6 in (101.6â152.4 mm), and larger than 6 in (152.4 mm). In the end, the final size class
was not included in the analysis (see Chapter 6) because no FCR fragments larger than 6 in were
found. The cumulative weight and total number of FCR fragments within each class and within
each archaeological context were then recorded in the project ACCESS database.

CURATION
Upon completion of the analyses and reporting, collected materials will be assessed for the
appropriateness for long-term curation. Some classes of recovered remains, such as burned rocks,
residual and bulk unprocessed soil samples, unidentifiable shell fragments, nonartifacts from the
heavy and light fractions of sediment columns (e.g., coarse sand, gravel, rootlets, etc.), unburned
(e.g., likely modern) macrobotanical remains, mass-produced Historic period artifacts less than
50 years of age, etc., will be earmarked for discard. A list of such materials will be prepared and
submitted to NTTA and the THC for approval before disposal. Artifact inventories will be
annotated to reflect the disposal of approved materials.
The remaining collections from the project will be prepared for curation according to the
packaging guidelines established by TARL at the University of Texas, Austin. Field and
laboratory forms will be on acid-free paper; negatives and photographs will be labeled and placed
in acid-free holders; cleaned and labeled artifacts will be placed in appropriate bags and boxes
suitable for long-term storage. An inventory of materials submitted to curation will be prepared
and a copy will be sent with the collection to TARL for long-term storage; other copies will be
sent to NTTA.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS OF THE TEST EXCAVATIONS
by Clayton M. Tinsley and Chris Dayton Ph.D.

MECHANICAL TRENCHING
Between October 2007 and September 2008, 30 trenches were mechanically excavated within the
project area. Most of the trenches (n=21) were placed on roughly eastâwest transects at
approximately 30-m intervals between the relict and artificial channels of Rowlett Creek. The
remaining nine were placed outside the area bounded by the channelsâthree in the northwest
corner of the project area on the west side of the relict channel, and six on the east side of the
project area east of the artificial channel (Figure 2).

Trench Results: Stratigraphy
Twelve of the 30 trenches excavated at the site were described and profiled by geoarchaeological
specialists, and a small section of trench B5 (which was partially filled in at the time of
inspection) was also examined. A sample description is presented in Table 2. All descriptions
are attached to this report as Appendix C. The results of this work suggest that there are at least
three and probably four distinct, episodically formed alluvial fills present at the site: (1) Late
Pleistocene to Early Holocene alluvium; (2) Middle to Late Holocene alluvium; (3) Latest
Holocene alluvium; and (4) Historic alluvium. Figure 4 presents an interpretive cross section
showing the inferred three-dimensional arrangement (or alluvial architecture) of these deposits at
the site. Excluding the Historic alluvium, the deposits appear to be youngest immediately
adjacent to the relict channel of Rowlett Creek and progressively increase in age to the east. The
youngest deposit, the Historic alluvium, appears to respect the modern channel of Rowlett Creek
and probably derived from overbank flows of this channel course. For this reason, these very
young deposits drape the eastern half of the site.

Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene Alluvium
The oldest archaeologically relevant deposit in the vicinity of the site appears to be a Late
PleistoceneâEarly Holocene alluvial fill that is exposed in cutbanks bordering the present channel
of Rowlett Creek, and that lies at depth beneath a veneer of Historic sediment in THTs E1

through E6 (see Appendix C). At its core, this deposit is a dark grayish brown to brown (10YR
4/2 to 4/1) silty clay to clay floodplain overbank deposit within which a significant soil has
formed. This soil has an A-ABk-Bk profile where the calcic soil horizon exhibits a Stage II
(nodular) morphology and is composed of a few calcium carbonate filaments and a few to
common small- to medium-sized calcium carbonate nodules. All of the horizons of this soil
exhibited well-developed structure and limited evidence of vertic tendencies (e.g., occasional
slickensides and pressure faces on peds, and black crack fills tonguing into the Bk horizon). The
degree of soil development, absence of any clear bedding in the fine-grained facies, and position
of this deposit toward the valley margin are consistent with a deposit of Late Pleistocene or Early
Holocene age. No cultural material was observed within it.

Middle to Late Holocene Alluvium
In THT B5 and several other trenches located between the relict and artificial channels of Rowlett
Creek, cultural material was observed within a near-channel depositional environment that is
composed of black to dark gray silty clay to clay, interbedded with thin gravelly beds. This
deposit is distinctly different from the sandy near-channel overbank facies alluvium associated
with the Latest Holocene alluvial deposit, which lacked gravel and was much lighter colored.
The buried A horizon that forms the top of this unit begins at a depth of 80 cm in the sample
trench profiled in Table 2. This horizon is most evident on the âBâ transect, particularly THTs
B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 (Figure 5). The paleosol has many of the normal pedologic
characteristicsâsuch as a moderately high level of soil development, strong blocky structure,
calcium deposits, gastropod shells, and clay skinsâof the late-Holocene-age West Fork paleosol
that is so common in fluvial deposits in the drainage basin of the Trinity River (Ferring 1986;
Prikryl 1990). Its presence also indicates a long period of low sedimentation rates and
accumulation of organic material in the site area. The surface of this paleosol displays some
modest topography in the site area and also varies considerably in thickness. It is likely that the
top of the paleosol was exposed and eroded prior to the deposition of the overlying unit.
Although the sediments below the paleosol contain some sand and silt, they are still extremely
clay-rich, indicating deposition in a low energy, fluvial, back-swamp environment.

Latest Holocene Alluvium
A young alluvial deposit was revealed by THTs E7, E8, and E9 on the south and west side of the
relict channel of Rowlett Creek. These three trenches exposed an alluvial deposit that was in
general fairly sandy, and for which the sediment color varied directly with texture. The finetextured sediments (e.g., silty clays and clays) were very dark gray (10YR 3/1); and coarser
sands, sandy loams, and loams were grayish brown and brown (10YR 4/3, 10YR 5/3, 2.5Y 5/2
and 2.5Y 4/2). The soil formed in this alluvial deposit exhibited an A-AC-C profile, and the
deposits preserved prominent traces of bedding (thin beds, many of which were laminated) that
were clearly interrupted by faunal and floral activity (worms in particular appeared to have been
very active here). The nature of the deposits exposed by these trenches is consistent with a nearchannel overbank setting and several prominent coarse sandy beds could be correlated between
the trenches. It is clear that these deposits respect the relict channel of Rowlett Creek and
undoubtedly originated from it. The prominent bedding, weakly developed soils, and proximity
to the channel all favor a recent age for these deposits, most likely the last millennium.

Historic Alluvium
A thin veneer of historic-age sediments was noted burying the Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene
alluvium north of the artificial channel of Rowlett Creek. The physical appearance of these
deposits is quite similar to the Latest Holocene alluvium (especially colors that vary directly with
sediment texture). Although it is often difficult to establish the age of such sediments with
confidence, especially with field evidence alone, in this case there is unambiguous evidence. All
three of the trenches situated in the hay field east of the artificial creek channel (THTs E1, E2,
E3) revealed the presence of buried furrows left by modern or Historic-period mechanical
agriculture (Figure 6). The sandy to silty furrow fill is very yellow and clearly derived largely

from limestone bedrock, and the orientation of the furrows is more or less perpendicular to the
artificial channel of Rowlett Creek. It is possible that this sediment was eroded from the uplands
during the construction of the housing development north of Bunker Hill Road.

Trench Results: Cultural Materials
Eleven of the trenches between the Rowlett channelsâTHTs A1, A5, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, C3,
C5, D2, and D4 (Figure 2)âwere positive for cultural material: mussel shell, burned earth,
lithics, and animal bone. These materials were observed in situ in the trench profiles, but were
not collected from the mechanically excavated fill. In addition, one trench outside the area
bounded by the channels yielded deer bone, but not in association with cultural materials (see
Appendix C). All of the cultural material observed in the trenches appeared to be contained
within a single alluvial fill of Rowlett Creek that was most likely deposited in the Middle to Late
Holocene. Although the exact age of this deposit is unknown, it is likely that this deposit spans
the period between 4,000 and 1,000 years before present (BP), or the Late Archaic in cultural
terms.

HAND EXCAVATION RESULTS

0.5-x-0.5-m Test Units
The next phase of the study consisted of 0.5-x-0.5-m hand excavations on the sides of the
trenches. Six 0.5-x-0.5-m test units (TUs) were placed on the sides of the nine trenches on the
eastern and western margins of the project area, outside the area between the channels. As
mentioned above, one test unit, TU E4, contained fragments of deer bone between 130 and 140
centimeters below surface (cmbs), but not in cultural context. None of the other 0.5-x-0.5-m test
units contained cultural materials (see Appendix C). The paucity of such materials in these
eastern and western units appears to confirm that 41DL203 is bounded eastâwest within the
project area by the relict and artificial channels.

1-x-1-m Test Units
Of the 11 positive trenches in the intrachannel area, eight were selected for hand excavation of 1x-1-m units. The trenches targeted for 1-x-1-m excavationsâTHTs A1, A5, B2, B3, B5, B6, C3,
and D2âwere those that contained not only mussel shell, burned earth, and animal bone, but also
fire-cracked rock and chipped stone debitage. Four of the 1-x-1-m test unitsâTUs B2, B3, B6,
and C3âcontained very little or no cultural materials of any kind (see Appendix A). One of the
remaining four test units, TU A5, yielded bone fragments and mussel shell but only seven lithic
artifacts (debitage and one tool) and 14 pieces of fire-cracked rock (see Appendix A). The final
three 1-x-1-m test units, TUs A1, B5, and D2, contained relatively large quantities of lithics and
fire-cracked rock complementing dense concentrations of bone and shell.

41

2-x-2-m Test Units
Because of the concentrations of cultural materials, the latter three units discussed above (TUs
A1, B5, and D2) were selected for expansion into 2-x-2 m units (Figure 7), with each expansion
given the suffix âBâ (i.e., TU A1B, TU B5B, and TU D2B).

TUs A1 and A1B yielded a total of 784 artifacts, generally concentrated in several levels between
150 and 240 cmbs (Table 3). The most significant find was a Gary point at approximately 170
cmbs (Figure 8a). Prikryl (1990) has shown that this type of dart point was ubiquitous in
Northcentral Texas during the Late Archaic.
TUs B5 and B5B yielded a total of 3,644 artifacts, with large quantities of bone, shell, FCR,
charcoal, and lithics (Table 4). These materials occur throughout the profile from primarily 100â
220 cmbs, with the heaviest concentration of materials occurring at approximately 140 cmbs.
Two Yarbrough points and a Gary point were recovered from 160-170 cmbs, and a heavily
retouched Yarbrough point from 200-210 cmbs (Figure 8bâ8d, 8f). Both types are characteristic
of the Late Archaic in Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1990).
Cultural layers are interspersed with gravel lenses and clay-rich sediment in the B5/B5B
stratigraphy, indicating repeated seasonal or annual occupations alternating with flood events or
shifting of the Rowlett Creek paleochannel. Assuming even moderately high sedimentation rates,
these cultural deposits would appear to be separated in time by several hundred years indicating

that this area was utilized repeatedly over an extended period of time. Further, the continued
sedimentation at the site caused the deposits from each of these occupations to be buried, sealed,
and stratigraphically separated from earlier and later ones. TUs B5 and B5B yielded the most
consistent concentrations of cultural materials of any units at site 41DL203, and similar
concentrations appear to extend out from both sides of the original THT B5. Given the location
and nature of these deposits, TUs B5 and B5B have the potential to contribute to our
understanding of subsistence practices, resource use, seasonality, and other issues important to
Northcentral Texas prehistory.
Like TUs B5 and B5B, TUs D2 and D2B yielded large numbers of fragments of bone, shell, firecracked rock, and charcoal in multiple strata, suggesting repeated utilization of the site (Table 5).
In total, 2,270 artifacts were recovered from TUs D2 and D2B, including two diagnostic dart
points, a Yarbrough point from 160â170 cmbs and a possible Gary point from 250 cmbs (Figure
8e, 8g), confirming the association of the middle and lower stratigraphy with the Late Archaic.
Although TUs D2B and B5B contained comparable quantities of bone and fire-cracked rock, TU
D2B contained about one-third as many lithic artifacts as B5B, lessening its potential for
comprehensive research. In addition, more postdepositional disturbance was noted in TUs D2
and D2B than in the other 1-x-1-m units selected for 2-x-2-m expansion.

SUMMARY
The preliminary evaluation of site 41DL203 recovered 7,249 artifacts, consisting of 501 lithics,
444 pieces of fire-cracked rock, 1,465 mussel shell fragments, and 4,839 bone fragments. Most
of these materialsânearly 90 percentâwere found in TUs A1, B5, and D2 and the associated 2x-2-m expansions (TUs A1B, B5B, and D2B). Of the three expanded units, TU B5B was
considered the densest, most complex, and least disturbed by postdepositional processes.

CHAPTER 6
RESULTS OF THE DATA RECOVERY EXCAVATIONS
by Chris Dayton Ph.D.

On January 19, 2009, the area of the B5C data recovery block was prepared for manual
excavation by mechanically stripping off the top 0.5â0.7 m of soil, as described in Chapter 4.
Excavation of the 5-x-5-m block began on January 20, 2009, and was carried out by a team that
varied in size from four to six people. Two crew members removed matrix in 5-cm levels, placed
it in buckets, and passed it to dedicated screeners, typically one or two per excavator, depending
on the density of materials encountered and the clay content of the matrix.
In general, conditions at the site were consistently mild and highly conducive to fieldwork, with
Fahrenheit temperatures ranging from the 20s to the 70s. Although Northcentral Texas is usually
characterized by moist winters, rain was rare during the excavations, causing only slight delays
and no serious damage to the block, which was covered with heavy tarpaulins at the end of each
dayâs work.
The row of five 1-x-1-m units on the northeast side of the block (A5 through E5; Figure 3) was
excavated first, all the way to the final depth of 225 cmbs (88.6 inches). This trench was then
used as a starting point and a guide to facilitate the âpeelingâ of 5-cm levels one square meter at a
time across the remaining 20 units, generally kept in phase or as close to it as allowed by
logistical considerations (Figure 9). By March 20, when final geoarchaeological samples were
collected and the entire area backfilled, approximately 41 m3 of matrix had been manually
removedâapproximately 30 percent more than originally proposedârevealing a distinct 1.5-m
stratigraphic sequence and yielding nearly 30,000 artifacts.
The remainder of this chapter presents observations of the strata, features, and cultural materials
encountered in the B5C block. Radiocarbon analyses performed later have been integrated into
the field observations.
STRATIGRAPHY AND DATING
As discussed in Chapter 4, the 5-x-5-m B5C block was divided into 1-x-1-m units, each of which
was excavated in 5-cm levels. The fine-tuned arbitrary levels were chosen to capture anticipated
vertical variations, which had been observed in exposures in the adjacent backhoe trench, THT
B5, and associated testing phase unit, TU B5B (see Chapter 5), as fully and systematically as
possible within time constraints.

Figure 9. View south-southeast of B5C block, as field technicians Steven Dunn and Johnathan Comer excavate
multiple 1-x-1-m units in phase. The A5âE5 trench, opened to 225 cmbs as a guide for the rest of the
excavations, is on the left side of the image. The upper excavated section at middle left is a safety bench
created where the initial mechanical stripping was particularly shallow.

After excavations were complete, the exposed wall deposits were sprayed with water,
photographed, and drawn. Composite photographs of the two most intact and stable profilesâthe
southeast and southwest sides of the B5C blockâare presented in Figures 10 and 11, with
corresponding schematic representations in Figures 12 and 13. The composite photographs
clearly reveal subtle color changes that were at times difficult to discern during excavations. The
basic characteristics of the B5C block stratigraphy are discussed below in order of depth, moving
down the profile. Further details and supporting analyses are presented in Chapter 7.
In units near the north corner of the block, a thin upper layer of very moist, sticky, very dark
grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay was occasionally encountered. This clay is not shown in Figures
10 and 12, as the intact profiles were located on the other side of the block. The clay was clearly
related to the excavation and filling of the original B5 test trench and the safety bench around it
(see Chapter 5) and will not be discussed further.
Below the mechanically stripped overburden, the main upper deposit across the B5C block was a
prominent paleosol with its upper boundary at 70â80 cmbs and its irregular lower boundary
extending to 110â130 cmbs. The paleosol consisted of a generally dry, crumbly, silty clay
ranging in color from black to very dark brown to very dark gray (respectively, 10YR 2/1 to 2/2
to 3/1). Diffuse scatters of rounded gravel and small cobbles were observed throughout the
paleosol, interspersed with varying quantities of animal bones, mussel shell fragments, FCR,
lithic tools and debitage, small chunks of charcoal, and rounded masses of baked clay. None of
these materialsâall of which are discussed in more detail later in this chapterâappeared to be in
situ. The densest concentrations of materials occurred near several large tree roots.

Below the paleosol, the matrix changed to a dark to very dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2 to 3/2)
silty clay from approximately 110â130 cmbs to the floor of the excavations at 225 cmbs. The
upper portion of this sediment (down to 140â150 cmbs), like the paleosol immediately above it,
contained varying concentrations of cultural materials. From 140â150 cmbs to approximately
165 cmbs, the profiles (Figures 10â13) showed a distinctive horizon of dense, rounded gravel
with few cultural materials, apparently the remains of a point bar deposit indicating an active
stream environment (see Chapter 7). Below approximately 30 cm of intervening deposits with
almost no cultural materials was another gravel horizon from approximately 190â205 cmbs, more
diffuse than the previous one and mixed with greater quantities cultural materials, especially
baked clay masses.
No clearly identifiable living or activity surfaces were encountered in the excavations. The best
candidate for such a surface is at 150 cmbs, directly above the middle gravel horizon and the level
upon which a small pile of lithic reduction debris was found (Feature 6, discussed below). Still,
this is only conjectural, based purely on the existence of Feature 6; no significant difference in
texture or color was observed across the block at or near 150 cmbs.
Both major soil/sediment typesâthe dark upper paleosol and the slightly lighter, lower clayâ
displayed a horizontal moisture gradient running northeast-to-southwest across the B5C block.
Throughout nearly all excavated levels, subunits along the northwest side of the block (i.e., the
rows of units beginning with A and B) tended to contain moister, stickier sediments, with harder,
drier sediments on the units along the southeast side (the D and E rows). Colors and overall
textures were generally consistent despite the moisture difference. The moisture differential was
most likely caused by the presence of the original THT B5 trench and associated testing phase
unit, TU B5B, which remained open for an extended period of time on the north corner and
northwest side of B5C. Drainage of subsurface water toward the wetter units was probably
encouraged by the open THT B5 trench, exacerbating the effect of a very slight topographic rise
to the southeast.
Several disturbance aspects were noted. Due to the light forest cover of the project area, many
tree roots were encountered in the excavations, some as large as 15 cm in diameter. Although
small roots were found in nearly all levels and units, the largest were concentrated in the upper
deposits. They are clearly visible in Figures 10â13. Clay casts of insect or rodent burrows were
noted throughout the block, again with a higher frequency in the upper deposits. Elements of the
cotton rat were found in small but similar frequencies throughout the deposits, suggesting an
intrusional element. Given the plant, animal, and microbiological activity inherent in any
pedogenesis, the paleosol is by definition a collection of disturbance vectors. In addition, the
high clay content of the matrix in this project is of particular concern, as clay soils, particularly
vertisols (and most particularly Texas vertisols), are known to destroy contexts and move artifacts
through shrink/swell action (Abbott 2001; Holliday 2004). The dominant modern soil of the
project area, Frio silty clay, is formally classified as a haplustoll, not a vertisol (NRCS 2009).
Still, argilliturbation in the form of short-term expanding and contracting was observed on the
surfaces around the excavation block. If this soil and other soils and sediments associated with it
cannot be described as vertisols in the strict sense, they can at least be characterized as vertic
(Holliday 2004). Finally, the gravel bars at 150â165 cmbs and 190â205 cmbs indicate the
presence of an active alluvial environment with the potential for extensive horizontal disturbance.
Still, from an overall perspective, the deposits below the paleosol appear to maintain significant
integrity; the cohesiveness of the gravel horizons and dramatic variations in concentrations of
cultural materials (see below) indicate that they have not been reworked completely, as in a gilgai
landscape (Abbott 2001). The chronological integrity of the deposits was tested with a series of
radiocarbon dates.
57

Contexts for absolute dating were chosen after completion of the block excavation. A significant
amount of charcoal was recovered in the excavations, noted on the forms, and particularly large
pieces collected. There were no in situ, unambiguously cultural features with charcoal in close
association with other materials, however. More specifically, many of the charcoal chunks
recovered showed clear evidence of rounding, either by alluvial transport or shrink/swell action.
Due to these factors and to the availability of large quantities of unusually well-preserved bone
throughout the sequence, the decision was made to date collagen from large fragments of
mammal bone. The B5C block was treated as a single unit for dating purposes. Final selections
for dating included the following high-priority targets: features of interest, spikes in the overall
quantities of cultural material, and finally reference dates at or near the top and bottom of the
excavations to bracket the entire sequence.
Accordingly, large, well-preserved fragments of deer bone were chosen from 70â75, 95â100,
125â130, 135â140, 145â150, 195â100, and 215â220 cmbs, and sent to Beta Analytic, Inc. (Beta).
One of the seven samples initially submitted to Beta, a bone from 95â100 cmbs that had appeared
to be well-preserved did not contain sufficient collagen for dating, so a replacement from the
same level was sent, along with a charcoal sample as backup in case taphonomic processes were
preferentially degrading bones at that level. The backup proved to be unnecessary, however; the
second 95â100-cmbs sample contained sufficient collagen. The seven dates obtained are shown
by depth order in Table 6, and their individual calibration curves are shown in the same order in
Appendix B. In addition to the radiocarbon dates, Beta performed stable carbon isotope analyses
on the same samples. The resulting 13C/12C ratios are consistently in the -19 to -22 â° range
except for a single outlier at the top of the sequence that may indicate a change in animal (deer)
plant consumption potentially linked to human subsistence patterns. These data presented in
Table 6 will be discussed further in Chapter 8.
Overall, the progression of radiocarbon ages tracks nicely with physical depth, with some
variation in the spacing indicating differential sedimentation rates. Dates 258089 (70â75 cmbs),
258091 (125â130 cmbs), and 258090 (215â220 cmbs) confirm the observed pedogenic
differential between the dark upper paleosol and the lighter clay beneath. Using the 2-sigma
ranges for each date and the 5-cm-level ranges for each date context, these dates give an average
sedimentation rate of 12.4â17.8 years for each centimeter of the lower sediment versus 20.7â30.8
years for each centimeter of the paleosol. These figures represent a substantial decrease in the
pace of deposition over time. Geologic and pedogenic implications will be further discussed in
Chapter 7.
Considered as a group, the dates confirm the overall vertical integrity of the levels in the B5C
block, despite evidence for various disturbance vectors. The B5C stratigraphic sequence covers
nearly three millennia of the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric, extending from Cal BC 1440â
1280 to Cal AD 1310â1440 andâperhaps most importantlyâincluding the transition between
these major periods.

FEATURES
Relative to the amount of matrix removed, few discrete features were encountered. Eight were
designated during the excavation. The two most striking are Feature 5, a small pit filled with ash,
and Feature 6, a pile of lithic reduction debris. Bone from each of these features was dated. The
rest of the features encountered were concentrations of baked clay masses associated with varying

quantities of other materials. The majorityâFeatures 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8âwere initially recorded
as features for cautionâs sake but later found to be no more than slightly denser concentrations of
the same materials observed throughout the 5-x-5-m block. All were collected in bulk for
flotation but none yielded macrobotanical remains. These less significant features will be
described first below, followed by a discussion of Features 5 and 6.
Feature 1 consisted of an approximately 1-x-1-m concentration of FCR, small pieces of charcoal,
and uneven masses of baked clay in unit C5 from 190â205 cmbs (Figure 14). Fragments of FCR
ranged from 1â10 cm in diameter and were not arranged in a functionally recognizable way (e.g.,
a hearth). The FCR, charcoal, and baked clay were all embedded in the same 10YR 3/2 matrix
found above and below. The identification of this feature occurred during the excavation of the
initial units A5âE5 trench to 225 cmbs (i.e. Testing Phase), before the field crew became familiar
with the siteâs stratigraphy. The materials in Feature 1 were later seen to be representative of the
lower baked clay and gravel horizon found throughout the block at 190â205 cmbs.
Feature 2 was found at 85â95 cmbs in units D4 and E4 and consisted of several large (5â10 cm),
rounded lumps of baked clay spread across an area of approximately 1-x-0.5 m (Figure 15).
Minor concentrations of lithics, bone fragments, charcoal flecks, and pieces of mussel shell were
found mixed in with the clay. As with Feature 1, these materials were found distributed
throughout the typical matrix, which in this case was 10YR 2/2 and 3/2 silty clay.
Feature 3 was found in units A4 and B4 at 140â145 cmbs. It consisted of an irregular series of
baked clay masses, some with vegetation impressions (although not consistently oriented) in an
area of approximately 1.6-x-0.8 m (Figure 16). Again, the baked clay was found in association
with occasional mussel shell and bone fragments.
Feature 4, found at 100â105 cmbs at the intersection of units B2, B3, C3, and C2, was a small
(0.2-x-0.2 m) concentration of burned and unburned quartzite and limestone (Figure 17). During
excavation it was revealed to consist entirely of a handful (n = 6â8) of rocks, with no lithics,
bone, or shell fragments found in association.
Feature 7 was found in unit C4 at 195â200 cmbs and appears to represent a continuation of
Feature 1, which was located at the same depth in the adjacent unit C5 to the northeast. Feature 7
consisted of only a single layer of scattered rocks mixed with baked clay masses and rare charcoal
fragments (Figure 18), both of the latter showing evidence of rounding. No other materials were
found in association with Feature 7.
Feature 8 was found at the intersection of units D3, D4, E4, and E3 (Figure 18) and consisted of
an irregular concentration of baked clay and chunks of extremely coarse, crumbly, fossiliferous
limestone. The feature measured approximately 1.5-x-1.25 m and extended from 195â205 cmbs.
During bisection of the feature, the baked clay was found to be mixed with rounded gravel
(Figure 19). Almost no materials were found in association with the clay and rock.
Feature 5 was found in units C1 and D1 at 130â145 cmbs and measured 0.6-x-0.4 m (Figure 20).
The feature included a small (0.2-x-0.2 m) pit filled with white (10YR 8/1) ash and rare charcoal
flecks in possible association with several large fragments of FCR. During excavation of the pit,
extensive root disturbance was noted, and several lenses of ash appeared to be material
transported away from the pit by taphonomic processes (Figure 21). Unfortunately, very low
quantities of lithics, bone, and shell were found near Feature 5, and the pit itself contained only

ash and rare charcoal. Despite the evidence of root disturbance, the presence of the
taphonomically fragile ash argued for generally good preservation conditions. Flotation of the pit
contents and surroundings, however, recovered no botanical remains. This feature is most likely
a hearth clean-out pit or a posthole.
By far the most striking feature encountered in the B5C data recovery excavations was Feature 6,
a conical 5-cm-tall pile of lithic reduction debris with its base at 150 cmbs, at the top of the
middle gravel horizon (Figure 22). The pile measured 0.2-x-0.2 m and was located at the edge of
unit B1, on its border with subunit B2. The pile consisted almost entirely of lithic debitage with
very little matrix and no other materials except for rare shell fragments and animal bones and
teeth at the perimeter of the pileâs base (Figure 23). One particularly large fragment of deer bone
(Beta-258095) was dated via AMS, yielding 2-sigma ranges of Cal BC 740 to 690 (Cal BP 2690
to 2640), Cal BC 660 to 640 (Cal BP 2610 to 2590), Cal BC 550 to 390 (Cal BP 2500 to 2340),
placing the pile within the Late Archaic. Several 1- to 2-cm-wide roots had grown through and
adjacent to the pile, but disturbance appeared to be minimal. The entire feature was collected for

flotation and microdebitage recovery. No macrobotanical remains were recovered. The pile is
the only feature from the B5C excavations that can reasonably be associated with a discrete, timebound activity, and thus represents a unique window into Late Archaic lifeways, particularly tool
production and modification.

CULTURAL MATERIAL OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE
After the completion of excavations but prior to analyses, a preliminary count of all recovered
materials was plotted against depth to help identify important contexts for absolute dating (Figure
24). The distribution of artifacts corresponds to the stratigraphy described above. Large
quantities of cultural materials are associated with the paleosol near the top of the sequence, with
the levels immediately above the densest (middle) gravel layer and in direct association with the
lower, less dense gravel layer. Layers with low numbers of artifacts correspond to the
undifferentiated alluvium at 165â190 cmbs and 210â225 cmbs.
Each class of cultural material recovered in the data recovery excavations will be discussed
separately below. As explained above in the stratigraphy section, the greatest interpretive
potential of this projectâs data appears to lie in vertical rather than horizontal concentrations.
Therefore, each discussion below will begin with a graph of the abundance by depth of the
material in question (with the exception of ceramics, of which only two in total were found) for
the 5-x-5-m block as a whole. Horizontal distributions will be examined in levels with
particularly high overall concentrations of that material.

marked with an âx.â Ceramics are not included due to their rarity (n = 2). The anomalous spike in lithic
abundance at 145â150 cmbs is caused by Feature 6, discussed above.

67

Ceramics
Two ceramic sherds were recovered from the B5C block, one from unit A5 and one from unit D5,
both from 70â75 cmbs. Both are characterized by paste consistent with local clays, tempered
with crushed, burned shell. No decoration is evident. Although a miniscule portion of the overall
body of artifacts from 41DL203, these sherds supplement a 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon date
of AD 1310â1440 from the same level on the opposite side of the 5-x-5-m block. Together, these
two lines of evidence confirm the association of the siteâs upper deposits with the Late Prehistoric
period, specifically with Late Prehistoric II, the later phase. Shell-tempered ceramics are found at
sites dating to this phase throughout the Southern Plains region. In Northcentral Texas this type
of ceramic (Nocona Plain) serves as the âprimary characteristicâ (Drass 1998:435) of the
Henrietta focus or complex, the best-studied and most prominent Late Prehistoric Plains Village
culture in Northcentral Texas (Brooks 1989; Forrester 1994; Krieger 1946; Lorrain 1967; Martin
1994; Woodall 1967a). By themselves, of course, these artifacts are not sufficient to do more
than suggest the possibility of Plains influence or a Plains-style lifeway. Plain shell-tempered
ceramics could also be associated with influences from the east (i.e. Woodward Plain) and
delineating the differences in ceramic types has proved difficult (Brack 1995). Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) provide a salient caveat, however: the prehistoric Native people of Northcentral
Texas should not be treated as if they were restricted to a binary choice of lifeways (i.e., Plains
vs. Woodland/Caddoan), and despite scattered similarities in material remains, cultural
developments could have taken place âlargely independentâ of both the Plains and the
Woodlands.
Botanical Remains
by Susan Allen Ph.D.
As described in Chapter 4, all features encountered in the manual excavations were 100 percent
bulk-collected and floated to recover charred and uncharred plant remains. In addition, to ensure
that all excavated levels were represented in the flotation, a complete 30-x-30-cm column was
collected in 5-cm levels from the southeast side of the B5C data recovery block. A 100-cc
volume of sediment was taken from each bulk sample prior to flotation and set aside for
microbotanical analysis. These samples, however, were deemed low priority due to poor
preservation conditions; sites with similar soils have not yielded significant quantities of pollen or
phytolithics.
All bulk samples were passed through a Siraf flotation apparatus, and the resulting heavy and
light fractions retrieved and separated by size. The fine and coarse components of the light
fraction material from each context were examined by Geo-Marine personnel using hand lenses
and low-power microscopes as necessary. Although nearly 100 samplesâcontaining a total
volume of approximately 1,000 l of sedimentâwere floated, no botanical remains other than
wood charcoal and modern rootlets were observed in the preliminary examination. Therefore,
pieces of wood charcoal large and solid enough to be identifiable (i.e., greater than 0.5 cm and in
a cohesive chunk) were selected opportunistically from both the floated light fraction and from
general provenience contexts throughout the block. The selection was not systematic and was
conducted as a supplement to the faunal analysis, providing scattered hints of environmental
parameters in the past. Given budget and time considerations, and given that no discrete features
were found in clear association with large, identifiable charcoal, the samples were collapsed into
10-cm levels to simplify the sequence for the analyst. Pieces large enough to allow identification
were found in the following 10-cm consolidated levels of the B5C block: 60â70, 70â80, 80â90,
90â100, 100â110, 110â120, 120â130, 130â140, 140â150, 160â170, 190â200 cmbs.
68

Within these 11 consolidated levels, evidence of a diversity of woody angiosperms was present.
Throughout the levels, consistent indications were found of deciduous mesic slope and bur oakshumard oak forest types, corresponding to Bezansonâs (2001) Types 31 and 32 (Tables 7 and 8).
No gymnosperm wood was identified. The nine taxa recovered include Carya illinoinensis
(pecan), Carya sp. (hickory type), Celtis sp. (sugarberry, hackberry), Fraxinus sp. (ash), Populus
deltoides (cottonwood), Prunus sp., Quercus sp. (deciduous oak), Quercus cf. muehlenbergii
(chinquapin oak), and Ulmus elm. In addition to these remains of wood, a single example of a
carbonized sedge tuber identified as Cyperus cf. esculentus (nutsedge, nutgrass, or chufa), which
is often found on well-drained sandy soils, was recovered.

The charcoal submitted for analysis was opportunistically collected from the flotation samples
and is thus not suitable for rigorous quantitative analysis. To allow for some quantitative
comparison between levels, an effort was made during analysis to identify pieces of all sizes and
to continue identification of specimens within each sample until taxonomic diversity reached a
plateau (Heinz 1991). This means that despite the opportunistic collection of âlargeâ charcoal
fragments for analysis, the full range of taxonomic diversity within each level should be
represented and provides a basis for comparison between levels, whereas quantitative comparison
in terms of the weight or number of fragments of each taxon is not reliable.

In terms of taxonomic diversity, the samples show relative homogeneity between two and four
taxa, which primarily include oak, ash, or elm as the dominant taxon. Although the relative
abundance of taxa is not statistically comparable, broad differences between levels in terms of
taxonomic diversity and the types of species represented provide tentative evidence for
geomorphic or climate change. However, any hypotheses regarding environmental changes that
are deduced on the basis of the wood charcoal require testing with an independent dataset that is
more statistically robust. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to describe the general stratigraphic
pattern and note potential correlation with environmental shifts.
At the lower end of the sequence, between 190 and 200 cmbs, only Cyperus sp. tuber was
represented. Between 160 and 170 cmbs, only friable fragments of angiosperm that was not
identifiable to the family level was represented. Between 140 and 150 cmbs, only hickory and
indeterminate angiosperm wood were identified. Between 130 and 140 cmbs, and in Feature 5 in
the same level, elm appears to be dominant, and Feature 5 is found in association with other
elements common to bottomland forest, including hackberry (sugarberry), hackberry
(sugarberry)/elm, pecan, and oak.
In contrast, between 120 and 130 cmbs, hickory is dominant and occurs together with pecan and
cottonwood, which is tolerant of flooding, perhaps reflecting the development of flooded areas in
response to the shifting river floodplain topography or climatic shifts, such as an increase in
precipitation or a decrease in summer temperature.
70

Ash is dominant between 110 and 120 cmbs, and occurs together with hickory and oak, as is
typical of deciduous mesic slope forests, Type 31 as identified by Bezanson (2001). Only ash and
hackberry/elm, which is dominant, were identified between 110 and 100 cmbs, and suggest
continuity from the preceding level.
At 90â100 cmbs, however, a major shift is seen in the reappearance of cottonwood and the
dominance of oak and elm in the assemblage, which also includes pecan and hackberry. As
suggested for 120â130 cmbs, the appearance of cottonwood in this level may reflect the
development of localized areas of flooding, and the increase in taxonomic diversity may reflect
increased human activity, particularly forest exploitation that would create more open conditions
that would foster the expansion of taxa such as hackberry and pecan and the expansion of bur
oak-shumard oak bottomland forests, Type 32 as identified by Bezanson (2001).
Above 80â90 cmbs (60â90 cmbs), oak is dominant and occurs together with other taxa that are
suggestive of a shift toward deciduous mesic slope forests, Bezansonâs (2001) Type 31. At 80â
90 cmbs, oak occurs together with pecan, hackberry, and holly, but at 70â80 cmbs, it is
accompanied by elm and plum, followed by the appearance of chinquapin oak at 60â70 cmbs, all
of which are suggestive of the continuation of relatively open forest conditions with less available
moisture than at 90â100 cmbs.
The absence of gymnosperm wood in the assemblage as a whole is noteworthy, and may indicate
the selective exploitation of hardwoods in all periods represented or, conversely, the relative
absence of softwood taxa such as eastern redcedar that might be expected to be present in the
area.

Fire-Cracked Rock
Fire-cracked rock is a common class of archaeological materials throughout North America
(Thoms 2009) and is particularly key in Central Texas, where FCR concentrationsâvariously
dubbed burned rock middens, thermal features, and rock ovens, among other termsââhave long
received a large share of archeologistsâ attentionâ due to their ubiquity (Collins 2004:109).
Despite this attention, little progress in linking FCR patterns to particular activities or behavior
patterns was made until the 1990s, when a flurry of studies, ably reviewed in Collinsâ recent
synthesis of Central Texas archaeology, resulted in âthe single most fundamental conceptual
advance in burned rock midden research . . . [the] recognition that burned rock middens likely
formed in several different waysâ (Collins 2004:109). Although FCR is present at a far smaller
scale in Northcentral Texas (for a rare exception, see Lintz et al. 2008), it is nonetheless an
important material class with the potential to illuminate changes in prehistoric behavior patterns,
particularly at a stratified site such as 41DL203. Since Collinsâs synthesis, recent experimental
studies have produced data and models with implications beyond Central Texas, some focusing
on FCR fragment morphology (e.g., Backhouse and Johnson 2007) and others on FCR size
distributions as an indicator of repeated reheating (e.g., Pagoulatos 2005; Thompson and Mauldin
2008).
Thompson and Mauldinâs (2008) work is particularly useful, with experimentally derived models
of size distributions tested against archaeological assemblages from 41KM69, a Central Texas
site with several dozen FCR features dating from the middle of the Late Archaic period (ca. 2,500
BP) to the end of the Late Prehistoric period (after 500 BP). In sum, Thompson and Mauldin find
71

generally consistent patterns of moderate to low FCR reuse, indicated by FCR collections with
fewer small fragments and more mid-sized and larger fragments, throughout the Late Archaic and
the initial portion of the Late Prehistoric period (Figure 25a). Then, at the end of the Late
Prehistoric period, they document FCR collections dominated by smaller fragments, a trend
interpreted as indicating greater fragmentation and therefore a higher degree of FCR reuse
(Figure 25b).

text.

They associate this change with the adoption of a subsistence regime focusing on intense
processing of low-return plant foods, probably chosen due to increasing populations and
decreasing game availability (Thompson and Mauldin 2008). These points are expanded to
continental scale by Alston Thoms (2009), who proposes a similar trend in an ambitious FCR use
model based on ethnographic, archaeological, and experimental data from across North America
and representing the entire Holocene. It must be said, however, that at the same time Thomsâs
model predicts more FCR due to greater plant-food processing, it does allow for a decrease
corresponding to the use of ceramics, which would obviate the need for stone boiling, a key FCRproducing activity in some regions (Thoms 2009).
At 41DL203, no in situ FCR features were encountered, although over 3,600 fragments of FCR
weighing nearly 58 kilograms (kg) were recovered during the data recovery excavations.
Features 1 and 5 included FCR, but not in recognizable arrangements and at a level of abundance
corresponding to small, minor thermal features. Generally, it appears that FCR features at the site
were most likely disassembled by a combination of alluvial processes close to the time of
deposition and the subsequent, repeated shrinking and swelling of the clay-rich soil. Still, the
distribution of FCR by depth has a clear correlation with human activity, with two major peaks
corresponding to peaks in the counts of other archaeological materials (Figure 26).

In the Geo-Marine laboratory, FCR collected at the site was washed, sorted, and analyzed
according to the protocols described in Chapter 4. Fragments were divided into the following
size classes:
Class A: smaller than 0.5 in (12.7 mm)
Class B: 0.5â1 in (12.7â25.4 mm)
Class C: 1â1.5 in (25.4â38.1 mm)
Class D: 1.5â2 in (38.1â50.8 mm)
Class E: 2â4 in (50.8â101.6 mm)
Class F: 4â6 in (101.6â152.4 mm)
Fragments were also divided into rock material types, including limestone, sandstone,
conglomerate (really a coarse, fossiliferous limestone), chert, quartzite, and several other minor
types (Figure 27).

about 64 percent of the total, and most of the rest is quartzite.

To test the siteâs FCR assemblage against the simulated curves produced by Thompson and
Mauldin, the collected FCR was first plotted as a series of relative frequency diagrams with
columns representing the percentage contribution of each size class in each level (Figure 28).
The distributions are skewed toward the larger size classes, a closer match to Thompson and
Mauldinâs low-reuse curve than to the high-reuse one (Figure 28a-b).

In total, 34 graphs were produced, one for each excavated level within the B5C block (from 55â60 cmbs to
220â225 cmbs), but are not included here. On the X axis, Class A = smaller than 0.5 in (12.7 mm); Class
B = 0.5â1 in (12.7â25.4 mm); Class C = 1â1.5 in (25.4-38.1 mm); Class D = 1.5â2 in (38.1â50.8 mm);
Class E = 2â4 in (50.8â101.6 mm); Class F = 4â6 in (101.6â152.4 mm).

As an additional test, the levels corresponding to Peaks 1 and 2 from Figure 26 were each
considered as a whole. All levels within Peak 1 that contained more than 1,000 grams (g) of
FCRâ80â125 cmbsâwere collapsed into a single body of material. The same threshold was
used for Peak 2, and resulted in the combination of 190â210 cmbs. Also, to investigate the
possible effects of different rock types, the FCR was divided into two basic material classes
within each of these thick, consolidated levels. The two classes are Quartzite and Sedimentary,
74

the latter including limestone, conglomerate (as mentioned above, a coarse fossiliferous
limestone), sandstone, and chert. The resulting frequency diagrams (Figures 29 and 30) are
heavily biased toward larger fragments, regardless of rock type. Peak 2 represents a relatively
short period of time, with two radiocarbon samples separated by approximately 20 cm but giving
nearly identical dates, both contained within the 2-sigma range BC 1440â1280 (Beta 258092 and
258090). Due both to the greater thickness of deposits collapsed and also the slower depositional
regime of the paleosol, Peak 1 undoubtedly represents a longer span of time-averaging, as much
as 1,540 years based on the outer ranges of the 2-sigma calibrations of Beta 258091 and 258089.
The upper peak straddles the Late ArchaicâLate Prehistoric transition, but the lower peak is
solidly assignable to the Late Archaic. Overall, the FCR assemblage from 41DL203 displays size
distributions characteristic of few to no reuse episodes, the general Late Archaic and early Late
Prehistoric pattern identified by Thompson and Mauldin (2008).

Baked Clay
Masses of baked clay, also described as burnt clay, burnt earth, or (with a layer of interpretation)
as daub, are common at prehistoric sites in Northcentral Texas and surrounding regions. Baked
clay may be found as massive, fused deposits enclosing hearths or cooking pits (Osburn and
Ward 2007), shaped or rounded nodules serving as boiling âstonesâ (Ford and Webb 1956), fallen
wattle-and-daub walls (Boyd 2004b), fallen plastered thatch structures (Drass 2008), intrusive or
local material deliberately or accidentally trampled into a surface, clumps brought into a living
area on collected plant roots (Goldberg 2008), insect nests that can sometimes be treated as proxy
indicators for human occupation (Boyd 2004b), or even as evidence of forest fires with no direct
relation to human activity at all.
Nearly 30 kg of baked clay fragments were recovered in the data recovery excavations at
41DL203. These were generally irregular, gravel-sized masses, many with evidence of oxidation,
reduction, or smudging due to fire. Munsell colors ranged from yellow (10YR 7/6) to yellowish
brown (10YR 6/4) to yellowish red (5YR 4/6-5/8) to pink (7.5YR 7/4). The masses were
distributed throughout the profile in a sequence comparable to that of FCR (see above), although
in this case the upper peak is more diffuse and multimodal (Figure 31). Nearly one-third of the
baked clay collected came from a single level, 195â200 cmbs, dated to Cal 390â740 BC (2-sigma
calibration, Beta 258092). Most were poorly hardened or extensively reworked by taphonomic
processes and are probably underrepresented in the collection due to crumbling during screening.
A basic analysis of these masses was performed in the Geo-Marine laboratory, where they were
separated into three types: masses with vegetation impressions, those lacking vegetation
impressions, and insect burrows. These categories were then subdivided into size classes:
smaller than 0.5 in (12.7 mm), 0.5â1 in (12.7â25.4 mm), 1â1.5 in (25.4â38.1 mm), 1.5â2 in
(38.1â50.8 mm), and larger than 2 in (50.8 mm).
Preliminary analysis of the size classes found that the bulk of the baked clay fell into the two
smallest of the five classes. A more productive line of analysis appeared to be the plotting of
weights by type (impressed, unimpressed, and insect nest) within each excavated level (Figures
32â34). These plots revealed dramatically different distributions of the three baked clay types.
Vegetation-impressed masses (Figure 32) tended to follow the overall depth trends of cultural
materials, with miscellaneous peaks in the levels corresponding to the paleosol and those directly
above the middle gravel horizon, then almost nothing between the gravel horizons, and another
set of peaks corresponding to the lower occupation. Though time and budget constraints
prevented detailed analysis of impression morphology, the field crew noted during excavation
that most of the impressed pieces were impressed on one side only, and only on outer surfaces; no
examples were found with vegetation integrated into the matrix (i.e., as temper), a necessary
component of true daub (Paul Goldberg, personal communication 2009). Again, the caveat must
be kept in mind that this is a qualitative field observation only. Another qualitative observation
was of orientation: the impressed fragments were often facing various directions, suggesting
postdepositional disturbance such as washing by the river (to be expected given the near-channel
location), and thus making it unclear whether the plant impressions had originally been facing up
or down. In a few limited instances, however, more cohesive, larger units of the baked clay were
observed in apparently in situ arrangements. In both of these cases, all plant impressions were on
the underside of the baked clay.

76

31. Weight of baked clay by depth

Unimpressed masses (Figure 33), however, were concentrated almost entirely in the basal levels
of the excavation. Finally, insect nests were distributed sporadically throughout the entire profile
(Figures 34 and 35). Though clay insect nests have been treated not only as proxies for the
presence of structures, but also for abandoned structures (Boyd 2004b), a note of caution is
sounded by the occurrence of insect nests in levels (e.g., 170â175 cmbs, 175â180 cmbs) that were
almost completely devoid of cultural materials.

To help narrow down the range of human activities and natural processes that might be
represented by the baked clay at 41DL203, experiments were carried out immediately after the
excavations were completed (see Chapter 7).

CHAPTER 7
GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD AND EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS

PART I: FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
by Charles Frederick Ph.D.
Geoarchaeological investigations at 41DL203 examined the paleoenvironmental history of the
site and explored the origins of the baked clay artifacts recovered at the site. The
paleoenvironmental investigations specifically focused on a column of samples collected from the
block excavation that were examined for a variety of bulk properties. The baked clay
investigations employed a mix of petrographic examination and experimentation to better
understand these enigmatic artifacts.

Methods
The physical properties of the sedimentary matrix of the site were documented from a series of 35
samples collected from 10-x-10-cm sample column samples collected at 5-cm increments during
the excavation from unit (B5C-E3). For each sample, the texture (or particle size distribution),
calcium carbonate content, magnetic susceptibility, organic carbon content, and stable carbon
isotopic composition were determined. A select suite of samples was also collected for thin
section preparation and soil micromorphological analysis. The details of the analytical methods
employed are described below, and the results of the lab work are presented in Figure 36.

Particle Size Analysis (Texture)
Texture analysis was performed using the hydrometer-sieve method (cf. American Society for
Testing Materials 1985; Bouyoucos 1962; Gee and Bauder 1986). Samples were first weighed
moist and then gently passed through a 2-mm sieve taking care not to crush fragile bits of burnt
earth that might be present. When more than 200 g of <2 mm sediment were obtained, the
remainder of the sample was transferred to a 1,000-milliliter (ml) beaker, and a 5 percent sodium
hexameta phosphate solution was added to break down the clays and to permit separation of the >
2-mm artifacts and gravels. After soaking for two days, during which time the samples were
repeatedly stirred, the samples were wet-sieved through a 2-mm sieve, and the coarse fraction
83

separated and dried. Coarse material caught on the 2-mm sieve, if detrital sediment (and not
artifactual), was then sieved at a 1-phi interval and the mass on each sieve recorded. In this
particular case, cultural material was counted and weighed separately for each size class so their
depth distribution could be examined, as well as to exclude them from the detrital totals used to
determine the properties of the alluvial sediments. A split of the < 2-mm-size material (roughly
50 g) was then soaked in 50 ml of a 5 percent sodium hexametaphosphate solution overnight, and
then mixed in a mechanical mixer for 5 minutes before being diluted to 1 liter with distilled
water. This mixture was placed in a 1-liter settling jar, mechanically agitated for 1 minute, and
then set on a table, after which point hydrometer readings were made at different time intervals
(specifically 1, 3.5, 15, 45, 300, and 1,440 minutes). A control hydrometer and temperature
reading on an empty jar with nothing but distilled water and the sodium hexametaphosphate
solution was made at intervals throughout the analysis to permit calibration of the hydrometer. A
small split of the < 2-mm soil was also oven dried to determine the moisture content and correct
the sample mass used in the hydrometer analysis (hygroscopic moisture correction). After 24
hours, the contents of the hydrometer jar were wet-sieved through a 37-micron sieve, and the
sand retained on the sieve was transferred to a beaker and oven dried at 105Ëc. This sand was
subsequently sieved at 0.5-phi intervals once dry and the mass retained on each sieve recorded.
From these data, the percentage of gravel, sand, silt, and clay, as well as various descriptive
statistics was calculated for the grain size distribution using a spreadsheet written by Paul
Lehman.

Calcium Carbonate Equivalent Content
A small split (either 1.7 g or 0.85 g) of the ground < 2-mm fraction of each soil sample was used
to determine the calcium carbonate equivalent (C.C.E.) by means of a Chittick apparatus
(Dreimanis 1962; Machette 1986). This sample was finely ground (to pass a 0.075-mm sieve),
and then weighed, and placed into a small (250-ml) Erlenmeyer flask. Once attached to the
Chittick apparatus, the liquid level in the measuring burette was set to -10 ml, then the stopcock
was closed so no gas could leave the system, and the leveling bulb was dropped in order to
establish a vacuum inside the sample chamber. At this point, the barometric pressure and
temperature in the room were recorded. Then 10 ml of 50 percent hydrochloric acid
(approximately 6 N HCl) was delivered to the sample flask, which was agitated intermittently
until the reaction had ceased (usually 1â2 minutes). At this point, the leveling bulb was raised to
the point that the liquid level inside of it was equal in elevation to the liquid in the burette, and the
volume of gas evolved was then measured and the calcium carbonate equivalent calculated.

Organic Carbon and Stable Carbon Isotopic Analysis
In order to determine the carbon content of each sample, splits of the < 2-mm size fraction were
submitted to the Analytical Chemistry Lab at the Institute of Ecology, University of Georgia.
The carbon content was determined on a Micro-Dumas NA1500 Combustion Elemental (C/H/N)
Analyzer (Carlo Erba Strumentazione, Milan). Details and general aspects of the method are
discussed by Schulte and Hopkins (1996). Prior to submission, calcium carbonate was removed
from the samples by treating a 2-g split of the < 2-mm-size soil with 6 N HCl. The samples were
allowed to sit 5 hours or until the supernant liquid was clear, and then decanted and subsequently
refilled three times in order to remove all traces of acid. After the third rinse, the decanted
sample was dried at 105ËC, and subsequently finely ground once dry.

Magnetic Susceptibility
Dry sediment samples that had been sieved to remove the > 2-mm-size material were packed into
2.5-cm plastic cubes, weighed, and then the low frequency (470 Hz) and high frequency (4700
Hz) magnetic susceptibility (kappa) was measured for the 0.1 setting on a Bartington MS2 meter
and an MS2b sensor. The mass corrected magnetic susceptibility (clf) and coefficient of
frequency dependency (cfd) were then calculated. The coefficient of frequency dependency (c fd),
is the percent difference in magnetic susceptibility measured at low and high frequencies
(calculated as: cfd = (clf â c hf)/c lf)*100). Elevated values of cfd (approximately > 10 percent; Gale
and Hoare 1991:213) are indicative of increased concentrations of fine-grained ferrimagnetic
minerals, most often maghemite, in top soils (Dearing et al 1996). The magnetic susceptibility
values are presented in Figure 36 and are reported in SI units (10-8m3kg-1).

Microartifact Analysis
The dry coarse fraction splits obtained during the particle size analysis were passed through a
suite of three sieves (8 mm [-3 phi], 4 mm [-2 phi], and 2 mm [-1 phi]) and sorted under a low
power binocular microscope (Leica S8 APO) into gravel and various artifact categories
(specifically burnt earth, debitage, fire cracked rock, mussel shell, and bone). These were then
counted and weighed and the results are are plotted on Figure 37.

Petrography
Small blocks of sediment cut from the excavation wall near unit E3 and a few other areas were
oven-dried and then vacuum-embedded with polyester resin and subsequently cut into slabs when
hardened. The slabs were first scanned on a flatbed scanner, and then blanks for thin section
were selected, cut to size, and then submitted to National Petrographic, Inc. (Houston, Texas) for
thin section preparation. Small artifacts of fiber-impressed objects were also submitted for thin
sectioning. Experimental clay balls and trampled surfaces were likewise submitted for thin
sectioning.
The thin sections were subsequently examined at a range of magnifications. Low magnification
examination was performed with the aid of a flat bed scanner, and the slides were scanned at
1200 dpi using transmitted light (slide mode). Full-page color laser prints of the slides were used
to perform the first pass assessment of each slide. Areas of interest were then identified and
examined with a Leica S8 APO binocular microscope fitted with transmitted light base and
polarizing filters. Higher magnification examination employed a Leica DMEP polarizing light
microscope. Descriptions of soils follow methods suggested in Stoops (2003) and Bullock et al.
(1985), and observations of burnt materials.

Stratigraphic Context of the Site
Geoarchaeological work during the testing phase compiled a stratigraphic model for the Rowlett
Creek deposits encountered during trenching and identified four distinct allostratigraphic units
that spanned the late Pleistocene to modern period (Figure 4). These deposits were identified by
their apparent age, and youngest to oldest are Historic alluvium, Latest Holocene alluvium,
87

Middle to Late Holocene alluvium, and Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene alluvium. A single
trench within 41DL203 was left partially open, but a complete description of that deposit was not
made by the geoarchaeologist at that time. This trench revealed two different age deposits, a thin
drape of overbank mud resting unconformably upon a prominent buried soil that was at the time
was correlated with the âWest Fork soilâ on the Trinity River (Ferring 1986; 1990). In the Trinity
basin, the West Fork soil formed at the top of the Pilot Point alluvium where it has been buried by
modern or recent alluvium (Ferring 1990:26). Aggradation of the Pilot Point alluvium began
around 4,500 years BP, and the formation of the West Fork soil appears to span the period
between 2,000 and 500 years BP (Ferring 1990:53); this deposit generally contains archaeological
sites of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric age. At the end of the testing phase, it appeared likely
that, on the basis of the relative stratigraphic position, degree of pedogenic development, and
archaeological inclusions, the fill within which 41DL203 resided was correlative with the Pilot
Point alluvium on the Trinity and of Middle to Late Holocene age.
In order to better document the macrostratigraphic setting of the site, at the end of the data
recovery excavation a THT (B5D) oriented roughly perpendicular to the course of Rowlett Creek
was excavated immediately west of the block, and this trench was extended toward the late
Holocene channel (southwest) and northeast (toward the modern rectified channel). The deposits
revealed by this excavation are illustrated on Figure 38 and show very clearly the bounding
unconformity between the two different age alluvial deposits. The approximate position of the
block excavation and the relative stratigraphic position of the radiocarbon ages obtained during
the data recovery excavations have been projected onto this drawing. It is clear that the channel
during the Middle to Late Holocene was probably located to the south of the block, given that the
most prominent gravel bed, which extends across the floodplain in the vicinity of the site, dips
gently down to the south.

Alluvial Deposition
The alluvial deposits exposed by the block excavation consist primarily of floodplain muds that
are periodically punctuated by thin, somewhat dispersed beds of fine gravel. The 10-x-10-cm
sample column that was collected during the excavation starts at 0.45 m below surface and
extends to a depth of 2.25 m, and appears to begin part of the way through the Latest Holocene
alluvium, which comprises the top three samples of the column. The Middle to Late Holocene
alluvium starts around sample 4 and continues below the base of the excavation. The results of
the bulk analyses for these samples are shown on Table 9 and micromorphological observations
for each horizon are summarized.

The Middle to Late Holocene Alluvium (> 3,100 to ca. 550 years BP)
The majority of the deposits excavated during data recovery were part of the Middle to Late
Holocene alluvium, which appears to be correlative with the Pilot Point alluvium on the Trinity
River. This deposit exhibits an 2Ab-2ABkb-2Bkb soil profile where the Ab horizon is a friable,
black (10YR 2/1, m) silty clay that contains small amounts of matrix-supported fine gravel. It has
a weak coarse prismatic structure that is apparent when dry, but when moist it is dominated by a
strong coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to a strong medium to fine granular structure.
The lower boundary is diffuse and smooth and located around 110 cmbs.

The ABkb horizon is a friable, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/1 to 10YR
3/2, m) silty clay to silty clay loam. Like the Ab horizon, it too contains small amounts of matrixsupported fine gravels and has a moderate medium prismatic structure that parts to a strong
coarse to very coarse granular structure. The lower boundary is located around 190 cmbs and is
diffuse and smooth. The most prominent gravel in the block excavation is situated in this horizon
around 150â160 cm, and this deposit could be traced for almost 30 m away from the block in
THT B5D. Within the block, it pinches and swells in lenticular bodies that look vaguely like
small bars that range between 30 and 100 cm wide and 10 cm tall.
The lowest horizon exposed in the block excavation is the 2Bkb horizon that consists of a very
friable (slightly sticky) dark gray to dark grayish brown (10YR 4/1 to 10YR 4/2) silty clay loam
to silty clay. It exhibits a weak to moderate prismatic structure that parts to moderate coarse to
medium subangular blocky structure. A few gravels are present within the Bk horizon, but
overall, much less than are present in the overlying deposits. In the block excavation, it was
difficult to discern any secondary calcium carbonate, but numerous calcium carbonate filaments
were present within this deposit in THT B5D.

93

Considered as a single depositional unit, the Middle to Late Holocene alluvium within the block
excavation exhibits a very slight fining-upward trend that primarily represents a gradual increase
in the amount of clay in the deposit. As to be expected, the calcium carbonate gradually increases
down through the profile, with the top part of the Ab horizon having around 48 percent, the AB
between 50 and 54 percent, and the Bk the most with values ranging between 54 and 63 percent.
The magnetic susceptibility (clf) is slightly elevated within the Ab horizon, and declines slightly
with increasing depth, with the exception of a prominent anomaly between 200 and 205 cm,
which is most likely attributable to the lowest occupation surface (discussed in more detail
below). The frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility exhibits values around 10 percent in
the A horizon, and this property decreases in value with increasing depth that is consistent with
its source being the concentration of ferromagnetic minerals in top soils (Dearing et al. 1996).

Sedimentation Rates
A suite of seven radiocarbon ages obtained from bones collected at different depths within the
Middle to Late Holocene alluvium provides a clear image of changing sedimentation rates
throughout the deposition of the Middle to Late Holocene alluvium (Figure 39). The lowest part
of the block excavation (the Bk horizon) appears to have been accumulating rapidly, about 2 cm
per year if the two lowest radiocarbon ages are taken at face value, but calculation of the rate
using the two lowest ages and the next highest one yields more modest, yet still fairly rapid rates
that range between 0.7 and 0.1 cm per year (or 7 to 10 cm per century). The sedimentation rate
proceeds to decrease with time (roughly 6.5 cm per century between 137 and 150 cm; 5 cm per
century between 127 and 137 cm; 4.2 cm per century between 97 and 127 cm) with the last two
radiocarbon ages indicating a rate of 0.03 cm per year or about 3.3 cm per century.
The general shape of this curve is typical of floodplains formed by vertical accretion whereby the
sedimentation rate decreases as the floodplain surface elevation increases. This occurs because
sedimentation gradually builds the floodplain surface above the height of the most frequently
occurring flood level, and with the passage of time, fewer floods are able to inundate the surface.
It is this decline in sedimentation rate that promotes the formation of the West Fork soil in the
upper half of this deposit as the rate of organic matter accumulation begins to outpace
sedimentation as the sedimentation rate slows. In mixed load streams, there is generally a fairly
dramatic change in floodplain texture through such a sequence, and the very minor shift in texture
observed here further reinforces impressions of Rowlett Creek as a mud-dominated system.

The Latest Holocene Alluvium (< 550 years BP)
In the block excavation at 41DL203, this deposit comprises a thin (roughly 60 cm) drape over the
top of the Middle to Late Holocene alluvium and exhibits an A-AB soil profile. However, this
deposit thickens significantly immediately to the south of the block excavation, where a mere
17 m away (at the southern end of THT B5D; Figure 38) this deposit is more than 1.6 m thick and
exhibits an A-AB-C-CA soil profile. At that point, the A horizon comprises about 40 cm of a
friable, very dark gray (10YR 3/1, m) silty clay that exhibits strong coarse to very coarse granular
structure. It is strongly to violently effervescent and has a gradual smooth boundary. The AB
horizon is about 20 cm thick and consists of a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2, m) silty clay
with weak medium to coarse subangular blocky structure. Like the A horizon, the AB is strongly
to violently effervescent and has a gradual smooth boundary. The C horizon consists of a very

friable dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2, m) silty clay to silty clay loam, with moderate to strong
medium subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine granular structure, and is
violently effervescent. A transitional horizon is present at the deeply buried interface of the two
alluvial units. The CA horizon is a violently effervescent, friable, very dark gray (10YR 3/1, m)
silty clay with weak medium to coarse prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium
subangular blocky structure. A clear smooth boundary separates it from the underlying âWest
Fork Paleosolâ (the 2Ab horizon formed at the top of the Middle to Late Holocene alluvium).
Within the block excavation the majority of this deposit was mechanically scraped away prior to
excavation, and only the base of the deposit is represented in the column sample (between 45 and
60 cmbs). As such, this section of the profile exhibits lower magnetic susceptibility values, and
greater amounts of calcium carbonate. The texture of this deposit, however, is almost identical to
that of the soil it buries. Like the Middle to Late Holocene alluvium, the deposits of the Latest
Holocene alluvium contain small amounts of matrix-supported gravel throughout.
95

Significance of Gravels
The presence of fine gravels throughout these alluvial deposits, as well as the presence of several
fairly clearly defined gravel beds, indicates that Rowlett Creek was subject to periodic largemagnitude floods that introduced gravel to the floodplain. The absence of significant sand during
these events seems to reflect the general nature of the sediment load of the creek during this
period of time. The occurrence of gravel within the deposits is slightly more common at the base
of the column than at the top, and clearly diminishes after the major flood that deposited the
gravel between 150 and 160 cm.
Although there is a small amount of gravel throughout the deposits, there are several depth
intervals with significantly more gravel, and these most likely represent discrete flood events.
Overall, there appear to be about six distinct peaks in gravel in the Middle to Late Holocene
alluvium, and if one assumes that each peak represents a single flood event, then these floods
have an average period of 475 years (Table 10), but as the floodplain surface gets higher, the
interval between these large-magnitude floods increases. In specific, in the lower part of the
deposit these large floods occur between 250 and 300 years apart, whereas the time between
floods in the upper part of the profile increases to between 420 and almost 900 years (Figure 39).

Between these large-magnitude floods that inundated the floodplain deeply enough to deposit
significant gravels on its surface, there were likely many more smaller floods that were of
insufficient magnitude to deposit significant amounts of gravel, but probably were able to deposit
only trace amounts. It is also possible that postdepositional pedoturbation (by worms, for
instance) may have spread these gravel out from discrete clast-supported deposits to the matrixsupported gravels that prevail today. Some support for these points may be found on Figure 40,
which is a photograph of a consolidated block though the main gravel bed present within the
block excavation. The lower gravel in this photo is largely matrix-supported with isolated groups
of gravel remaining clast-supported, but it is likely that this deposit was entirely clast-supported
when initially deposited and that fine-grained matrix has filtered into the interstitial spaces
between large clasts following deposition, first through floodwater infiltrating the open matrix
deposit during the next large flood, but also by postdepostitional activity of worms. The second
point worth considering here is that the bulk sample column, which is one of the main sources of
information for this analysis, lumps this deposit into a single gravel-rich deposit, when the

Figure 40. Photograph of a consolidated sediment block through the gravel bed in the AB horizon at 143â156 cm bs
in unit E1 (this is the same as the gravels in the column sample between 150 and 160 cm). Although this
interval in the column sample appears to be a single flood event, this block suggests that it may actually be
two discrete events closely spaced in time. The lower gravel bed is clast-supported in places, but there is a
significant amount of interstitial clay that has been moved into this deposit following deposition. The
upper gravel bed is not as thick as the lower, and appears to have been occupied soon after deposition as
cultural material (e.g., burnt earth [labeled BE on the block] and charcoal) are intimately mixed into this
deposit.

consolidated block clearly shows that this is probably two different large-magnitude floods
separated by 2â3 cm of overbank mud. The upper gravel is thinner and now more dispersed than
the lower gravel, but is typical of the relatively low-visibility flood deposits that appear to have
been common in this setting during the late Holocene. In the field it was difficult to tell that there
were two discrete flood deposits present and it was only upon slabbing of the consolidated block
that this became clear.
97

Occupation Surfaces within the Middle-Late Holocene Alluvium
Although there are a few very discrete Late Prehistoric occupation surfaces at the site (the lowest
occupation being the best example), the occupations in the buried soil at the top of the Middle to
Late Holocene alluvium are difficult to discern stratigraphically, both in the field and from the
excavation data. In the process of obtaining the granulometric data, it was necessary to exclude
artifacts from the gravel assemblage, and in this process, counts of the small gravel and larger
artifacts were made (Table 10; Figure 37 for plots). Because microartifacts are often moved
differently by postdepositional disturbance processes, they can sometimes provide clues to the
operation of those processes. In this particular case, some of the microartifacts compare very
favorably with the stratigraphic distribution of the macroartifacts (for example baked clay/burnt
earth; Figure 36) whereas others, such as bone, correlate poorly, if at all.
Perhaps one of the more enlightening aspects of the microartifact analysis is the reasonably good
correlation of baked clay/burnt earth with the low frequency magnetic susceptibility (r=0.667)
(Figure 41). The macrobaked clay recovered from unit F3 is less well correlated with magnetic
susceptibility (r=0.481) in E3, but the overall depth distribution of baked clay from the block
excavation shows the best correlation (r=0.696). Magnetic susceptibility has been used
previously to identify buried occupation surfaces in stratigraphic sequences (e.g., Dalan 2008),
but the correlation of demonstrated occupation surfaces with magnetic susceptibility peaks is
uncommon because of a variety of factors. Magnetic susceptibility enhancement of occupation
surfaces is typically attributed to the scattering of thermal refuse upon occupation surfaces,
primarily by means of cleaning out hearths or other thermal features, discard of the ash, spent
burnt rock/earth and charcoal, and the subsequent dispersal of this material distribution across the
surface by foot traffic, overland flow, and other processes. In rapidly buried short-occupation
sites, a high degree of spatial patterning in the thermal refuse seems to decrease the probability of
identifying magnetic susceptibility peaks unless a fortuitous excavation samples through a
primary discard area or near a hearth. Sites with longer surface exposures and greater
stratigraphic compression seem to have a greater chance of having correlations between
occupation debris and magnetic susceptibility.
In this particular case, the lowest occupation, which is located in the most rapidly aggrading part
of the profile, has a very discrete magnetic susceptibility anomaly that appears to be partially a
coincidence in terms of the sampling location (the column appears to have been near a feature).
Nevertheless, it is also conspicuous that the top of the West Fork Paleosol (where the organic
carbon peaks) is associated with a decline in magnetic susceptibility and the peak in magnetic
susceptibility is somewhat lower in the profile. Given that soil formation processes also
contribute to the enhancement of magnetic susceptibility in soil A horizons (Mullins 1977), it was
anticipated that the magnetic susceptibility would follow the organic carbon (r=0.596), but in
fact, it more closely follows the distribution of thermally altered artifacts.

Regional Correlations of the Rowlett Creek Alluvial Deposits
The work done at 41DL203 permits some comment on the alluvial stratigraphy of Rowlett Creek
and how the chronology of this sequence of alluvial deposits compares with other Late
Quaternary alluvial stratigraphic sequences in Northcentral Texas. Although only one of the four
alluvial depositional units identified during the testing was dated directly, this permits comment
on the age of the bounding strata.

Side-by-side comparison of the depth variation in magnetic susceptibility (clf) with the distribution of
micro- and macroburnt earth. A reasonably strong correlation (r=0.66) exists between the microburnt
earth and (clf), but the macroburnt earth distribution is significantly less (r=0.48).

The Trinity River
Given that Rowlett Creek is a tributary of the Trinity River, the most directly relevant
stratigraphic sequence is that described by Ferring (1986, 1990,; Ferring and Yates 1997) for the
upper Trinity River. Ferring recognized four unconformity bounded stratigraphic units or
alloformations that had been deposited in the last 14,200 years. Three of these appear to be
relevant to the work performed at 41DL203: the Sanger alloformation (9,500 to 6,000 years BP),
the Pilot Point alloformation (4,500 to 500 years BP) and the Recent alluvium (< 500 years BP).
The oldest unit identified in the testing phase at 41DL203 was the Late Pleistocene-Early
Holocene alluvium that appears to be roughly correlative with Ferringâs Sanger alloformation.
Given that no radiocarbon ages were obtained for this deposit at or near 41DL203, it is
impossible to be certain that this deposit is correlative, but the degree of soil development and
stratigraphic position are consistent with such an interpretation.
A more confident linkage may be drawn between the Middle to Late Holocene alluvium, within
which the prehistoric occupations are situated at 41DL203, and Ferringâs Pilot Point
alloformation based on the radiocarbon ages obtained from data recovery excavations. Although
work at 41DL203 did not reach or radiocarbon date the base of this alluvial deposit, the existing
99

radiocarbon ages indicate that deposition of the Middle to Late Holocene alluvium began before
3,100 years BP and continued until around 550 years BP, which is very similar to the Pilot Point
alloformation. The cumulic soil formed within the Middle to Late Holocene alluvium, which
appears to have been deposited between roughly 2,600 and 550 years BP, is chronologically
similar to the cumulic soil Ferring (1986; 1990) identifies within the Pilot Point alluvium, which
he named the âWest Fork Soil.â Hence, this deposit appears to correlate well with Ferringâs Pilot
Point alloformation.
The 550-year-BP radiocarbon date obtained for the top of the Middle to Late Holocene alluvium
in the block excavation at 41DL203 provides a good basal age for the overlying deposit,
specifically the Latest Holocene alluvium, which appears to correlate well with Ferringâs
youngest unit on the Trinity River, the Recent alluvium. Although no radiocarbon ages were
obtained on this deposit, it clearly was deposited within the same general period of time, although
the modern channel of Rowlett Creek appears to have an even younger alluvial deposit associated
with it. The buried agricultural furrows found within this deposit north of the modern channel
suggest that this younger deposit is of Historic age (< 150 years old), but again, no radiocarbon
ages are available for this unit.
Overall, it appears that the alluvial deposits of Rowlett Creek bear a strong similarity to those of
the Trinity River, but there is one major difference between the two streams. On the Trinity
River, all of the Latest Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial deposits are inset one on top of another
in a âlayer cakeâ fashion (vertically superimposed), but on Rowlett Creek, the different age
alluvial units are clearly inset into one another laterally. This indicates that Rowlett Creek has
experienced periods of channel incision and lateral erosion that alternated with periods of
sedimentation (a process known as cutting and filling), resulting in a very different threedimensional spatial arrangement of its deposits (also known as the alluvial architecture) than the
Trinity, and this has significant implications for where archaeological sites of different age may
be found. Unlike the Trinity River, where Middle Archaic and older cultural deposits lie deeply
buried (> 4 m), the cut-and-fill behavior and generally thin (< 6 m) deposits of Rowlett Creek
result in Middle Archaic and older deposits that may be reached by backhoe trenching with a
large backhoe or trackhoe. Hence, this archaeological record is much more approachable than on
the Trinity River.
South Sulphur River
Although there are few other reasonably well-dated alluvial stratigraphic sequences in North
Texas, at least one bears mention here. Bousman et al. (1988) identified five major periods (or
âstagesâ) of Late Pleistocene and Holocene alluviation on the South Sulphur River at Cooper
Reservoir, which is located east of Dallas. The oldest of these, Stage II, consists of a localized
deposit dating to the period between 14,000 and 11,000 years BP. It is separated from the next
younger deposit by a period of deep entrenchment and lateral erosion, and all of the subsequent
deposits vertically aggrade in a style similar to the Trinity River. Stage III was deposited in the
period between 11,000 and 5,700 years BP and contains three radiocarbon-dated buried soils.
Stage IV dates to the period between 4,800 and 1,900 years BP and was followed by the
deposition of Stage VI between 1,500 and 550 years BP. The final Holocene deposit, Stage VI,
represents deposition in the last 500 years. Although there are some similarities between the
Rowlett Creek deposits and the South Sulphur River, there are several distinct differences in the
major periods of sedimentation, and it seems that the Rowlett Creek sequence is more similar to
that of the Trinity than of the South Sulphur River at Cooper Lake.

Paleoenvironmental Change: Stable Carbon Isotopes
One of the main sources of paleoenvironmental information collected during the analysis of
41DL203 is the stable isotopic composition of bulk soil/sediment organic matter. Figure 42
compares the results of the stable carbon isotopic data collected at 41DL203 with two other
studies in this region: the Elm Fork of the Trinity River at the Aubrey site in Denton County,
(Humphrey and Ferring 2001) and the West Fork of the Trinity River at 41TR198 (Frederick
n.d.). Also shown on this figure are results of stable carbon isotopic studies from West Amarillo
Creek near Amarillo, Texas (Quigg et al. 2008), and results from the Richard Beene site (Nordt et
al. 2002). Four of these sequences are derived from bulk carbon in alluvial deposits (West
Amarillo Creek, West Fork Trinity River at 41TR198, Richard Beene site, and Rowlett Creek at
41DL203 [this study]), whereas one (the Aubrey site on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River;
Humphrey and Ferring 2001) is derived from carbon within pedogenic calcium carbonate.
Although Humphrey and Ferring (2001) report stable carbon isotopic results for organic carbon in
bulk sediments, they only have one data point in the last 3,000 years, whereas the calcium
carbonate record contains six points for the period between 3,000 and shortly after 2,000
radiocarbon years BP.

42. Plot of the results of four Late Holocene stable isotope studies

Figure 42. Plot of the results of four Late Holocene stable isotope studies, three of which are in the Dallas-Fort Worth
region (Rowlett Creek (this study) and the Aubrey site (Humphrey and Ferring 2001), as well as Nordt et
al. (2003) at the Richard Beene site near San Antonio, and Quigg et al. (2008) at West Amarillo Creek near
Amarillo).

The results of the stable carbon isotopic ratio analysis of bulk organic carbon at 41DL203 show a
progressive increase in organic carbon from C3 plants from the start of the record around 3,100
years BP to around 500 years ago, after which a prominent shift toward C4 plants occurs (equating
to about a 10 percent increase in C4 plant organic carbon). This shift in favor of more-arid101

adapted plants is much later than is suggested by the Aubrey site calcium carbonate record, or
that indicated by the bulk carbon record from West Amarillo Creek, which shows the shift to be
around 1,500 years BP. The complacency in the 41DL203 record may be in part due to the
gradual dominance of pedogenic processes and local vegetation over depositional processes and
regional carbon sources during the later stages of the Middle to Late Holocene alluvium
deposition, when sedimentation rates fall and formation of the âWest Fork Paleosolâ becomes
less cumulic. It appears likely that arboreal vegetation similar to that of the present day became
established around 2,000 years BP, and this dominates the stable carbon record until accelerated
sedimentation associated with the start of the Latest Holocene alluvium begins around 500 years
BP, when the carbon sources are once again largely from detrital (or regional) sources rather than
local ones.
It is unfortunate that the entire profile at 41DL203 was not sampled during fieldwork. The bulk
samples used in this analysis were collected from the block excavation and the latest Holocene
alluvium, which buried the âWest Fork Paleosol,â was removed prior to the start of the
excavation. It would have been interesting to see the trend in stable carbon isotopes throughout
the deposition of the last 500 years, but it is anticipated that it would look something like the
record obtained from 41TR198. The stratigraphy at 41TR198 is almost identical to 41DL203 in
terms of age and structure, and there the stable carbon isotopic record shows a similar shift in
favor of C4 plants that is tied to the onset of Recent alluviation around 500 years BP, but the
values then drift back toward those associated with the West Fork Paleosol toward the modern
surface.
In summary, the carbon isotopic record from 41DL203 suggests that the vegetation at the site
became increasingly dominated by arboreal or C3 sources until the West Fork Paleosol was buried
by the Latest Holocene alluvium. After that, a shift to slightly more C4-rich vegetation is
recorded.

PART II: EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
by Charles Frederick Ph.D., Chris Dayton Ph.D., and Clayton M. Tinsley

Introduction
Two morphologically distinct forms of baked clay were present in the artifact assemblage from
the site: (1) irregular-shaped fragments and (2) small plant-impressed fragments. The quantity of
burnt earth objects in the assemblage seemed quite high for incidental creation in an occupation
assemblage in this region, so a series of experiments was established to see if these features could
be replicated.
The irregular-shaped fragments, upon closer inspection appeared, on the basis of the oxidation
patterns exhibited, to have been rather large, and it was openly speculated that these may be the
remains of baked clay balls that elsewhere in the state (specifically the coast) were made to stand
in for rocks as heat storage devices in thermal features like hearths. The Rowlett Creek
floodplain today is relatively rock free and the use of faux rock in hearths would make sense from
a functional point of view if one did not want to carry rock for cooking purposes a long distance.
However, the absence of a clear prehistoric tradition of the use of baked clay balls in this region
initially seemed to suggest that this idea was unlikely, but conversations with Paul Lorraine
102

(personal communication, 2009) at the Dallas Archeological Society meeting revealed that such
objects had been previously observed in the region. In specific, Lorraine revealed that at
41DL240 many fist-sized burnt clay balls had been discovered in excavations. Following this
observation, the irregular clay fragments were presumed to be the disarticulated remains of clay
balls as faux rocks in hearths and ovens. If clay balls were used in this capacity, then the
presence of large quantities of these objects in the assemblage is quite understandable, because,
although such objects might stand in for short-term rock use, they would undoubtedly have a
shorter use life and eventually end up discarded on occupation surfaces, as does burnt rock
throughout Central Texas.
Of the pieces of baked clay recovered at site 41DL203, 26 percent (by weight) displayed plant
impressions, accounting for almost all of the upper baked clay. These plant or fiber-impressed
objects (FIOs) were also common at the site and were usually less than 2â3 cm in diameter, and
1â1.5-cm thick fragments of lithified clay typically exhibited a single smooth side that was
impressed with grass-sized plants. The opposite side usually exhibited a rough surface that
lacked fiber impressions. The FIOs were initially thought to be daub, but close inspection of
these objects reveals that their morphology is at odds with common daub, which is a form of
earthen or mud plaster used to seal the walls of a structure. The most common form of daub
exhibits impressions of structural wood (small sticks as well as much larger structural timber),
and if it exhibits fiber impressions, they usually occur on broken interior surfaces because grass
or straw was often used as a temper in earthen plasters. The FIOs recovered from 41DL203
exhibited fiber impressions on one surface, and neither larger timber impressions nor interior
fiber temper impressions were noted. One fragment was observed with a stick-sized impression,
but this was a rare case. In two instances these objects were discovered in situ as plate-like, thin,
horizontal to subhorizontal, wavy surfaces, and in one of these in THT B5D (Figure 43), the
fiber-impressed surface was oriented downward. This plate-like object (which unfortunately was
not recovered in situ) was about 30 cm long, at least 20 cm wide, and about 1â2 cm thick. It
seemed clear at the end of fieldwork that this was probably not daub, at least not ânormal daub,â
but the origin of these objects was not clear, so a series of experiments was established to better
understand their formation.
To help narrow the range of human activities and natural processes that might be represented by
the baked clay at 41DL203, experiments were carried out immediately after the excavations were
complete. During the backfilling of the B5C block, trackhoe operator Danny Chavis removed
two scoops of material for use in the experiments: one scoop from approximately 70â120 cmbs,
representing the âpaleosolâ (the West Fork Soil, or 2Ab horizon), and one from approximately
150â200 cmbs, representing the âlower clayâ (the 2Bk horizon). These materials were used in
two experiments that were designed to gain insight into the use of the use of clay balls as thermal
elements in hearths and to explore the creation of the fiber-impressed objects.
The clay ball experiments, described in detail below, involved making two sets of clay balls from
the two raw material samples (the paleosol and the lower clay). One set of balls was gradually
dried before firing (designated âdriedâ balls), whereas the second set was made immediately
before being placed in the fire (i.e., âexpedientâ balls). The two sets are simply referred to
hereafter as âdriedâ and âexpedient.â
The fiber-impressed-object experiments were a bit more involved. During the excavations, field
crewmembers observed vegetation being tracked onto the ground surface around the margins of
the excavation block, particularly during rains, and speculated that a fire built on the inadvertently

trampled surface around the block might produce similarly impressed fragments. Given this
evidence, it was suggested that the impressions resulted from the construction of a fire on a clay
surface.
To test how the upper and lower soils responded to different treatments, various surfaces were
created with each of the sampled soils. A 2-x-1-m rectangle was measured out at the project site
and subdivided into eight 0.5-x-0.5-m squares (Figure 44). Four surface treatments were tested
for each soil, for a total of eight experimental surfaces. In the first set of squares, the upper and
lower soils were simply dumped. In the second, they were trampled. In the third, the soils were
dumped, covered with vegetation, and then trampled. In the fourth, the soils were dumped on top
of blocks of sodâto simulate clay on a grassy surfaceâand then trampled. These surfaces were
allowed to dry in the spring air for several days, and then a hardwood fire was built on top.

Figure 44. Southeast view of 41DL203 experimental surfaces built on top of backfilled excavations.

On April 5, 2009, the fire was set on the site of the backfilled excavation using wood from trees
that were felled prior to the excavation. The fire was initially set in the center of the 2-x-1-m clay
pad with wood shavings and other kindling, then fed with twigs and limbs of increasing size, then
spread out across the pad and fed with large (5â15-cm diameter) limbs of pecan, bois dâarc, and
other hardwoods. After the fire had been stoked and spread for approximately one hour, the dried
and expedient clay balls were added, and were burned for approximately 3 hours (Figure 45).
Although no temperature controls were used in the experiment, the fire was very hot and burned
for about 4 hours, after which it was allowed to burn down to embers and the clay balls were
subsequently raked out and allowed to cool.

Clay Balls
The presumed clay balls that were recovered from the excavation were not clearly balls, but
rather irregular-shaped broken fragments of burnt or baked clay. As mentioned above, most of
the pieces of baked clay collected during the screening of the DL203 matrix were irregular, but
several that disintegrated during excavation (especially in the lower occupation level) were nicely
rounded, with reduced cores and oxidized outer layers, indicating placement of the entire round
mass in a fire and possible use as thermal elements. In general, it is not uncommon on clayey
substrates to observe small amounts of very small (< 5-mm diameter) baked clay on occupation
surfaces associated with the cleaning out and subsequent discard of thermal refuse from hearths.
However, the amount of these baked clay objects in the 41DL203 assemblage was considerably
in excess of this phenomenon, both in the aggregate and on the scale of individual fragments.

Macromorphology
Many of the burnt clay objects recovered from the excavation exhibited black or dark gray cores
and orange oxidation rims that paralleled one or more of the exterior surfaces. It was presumed
that these oxidized rims paralleled the surface of the object that was placed in a high temperature
environment, a hypothesis that was later tested through experimentation. However, this
assumption suggested that some of the burnt clay objects were once considerably larger than
when found. Much of the burnt clay was very friable and easily cut by trowel during the
excavation, and for this reason, they were often not recovered as large fragments. The fragments
were often relatively smooth on one or more sides, and exhibited angular edges along others.
Micromorphology
Petrographic examination of a single clay ball found in primary context in a micromorphology
block from the lowest occupation, as well as numerous small, burnt earth fragments in other
occupation surfaces, clearly shows that these burnt objects contain a significant amount of fine to
medium (0.1â0.3 mm) limestone sand. When these burnt objects are compared to the
surrounding matrix and experimental clay balls made from the site matrix (Figure 46), it becomes
clear that the artifacts are compositionally different from the clays that comprise the site matrix
and are not merely objects expediently formed from the clay beneath the occupation surface, but
rather appear to be composed of material selected elsewhere and brought to the site. A suite of
petrographic thin sections was made of various parts of the site deposits, and none of these thin
sections revealed any deposits similar to the clay ball artifacts in terms of grain size. The location

of this sand source does not necessarily have to be far away (perhaps only as far as the nearest
stream channel) but the important point here is that coarser texture material was intentionally
selected for use.
The clays at the site contain a considerable component of shrink-swell clay minerals (e.g.,
montmorillonite or smectite), which expand and contract with changes in edaphic moisture. Such
clays are not generally good choices for ceramic objects because the shrink-swell tendencies
promote cracking, but some of these volumetric changes can be attenuated through the addition of
coarse temper (either fiber or sand). It is possible that clay ball fragments examined from the site
are local clay heavily tempered with sand, but the amount of temper (presumably derived from
the Rowlett Creek channel?) appears not to have precluded breaking of the balls along shrinkage
cracks (Figure 47).

Replication Experiments and Methods
In order to examine the use of clay balls as thermal elements in hearths, a series of experiments
was performed. Clay balls were made each materialâthe paleosol and the lower clayâby first
moistening the earth, working it manually to remove air bubbles, and then rolling it into balls.
The soil was used âas isâ and was not sifted or otherwise preprocessed, although some informal
effort was made to avoid large inclusions. Each soil produced two balls approximately 10 cm in
diameter and three approximately 5 cm in diameter. The balls were baked in an electric oven at a
low heat (approximately 150â200Â°F). Although electric ovens would not, of course, have been
available to prehistoric populations, it was felt that such a drying strategy would approximate the
effects of sun-drying, which would have been at a lower temperature but could have been done
for an extended period of time, over weeks or more. In addition, during the experimental burn,
more balls of the same soils were made onsite and immediately placed in the fire, with no drying
time, to see if it was possible to expediently produce useable thermal elements. The clay balls
were placed in the fire for approximately 3 hours and raked out of the fire as it cooled. Initial
observations were that the expedient balls crumbled rapidly. The dried balls generally fared
better, but only those with a 5-cm diameter; the 10-cm balls cracked and partially disintegrated.
Once cool, some of the clay balls were imbedded in polyester resin and thin sections made in
order to permit petrographic examination. Petrography was also the principal analytical tool of
choice for suspected Late Archaic burnt clay artifacts, because once fired, petrography is the only
way to assess basic artifact attributes such as texture and composition.

Dried vs. Expedient
The major difference observed between the two experimental groups was the size and degree of
cracking that occurred during drying. The clay balls that dried slowly exhibited fewer cracks and
larger fragments, whereas the expedient clay balls contained more cracks resulting in smaller
fragments after firing (Figure 48). Although the clay balls were only fired (or used) once, this
basic difference in cracking pattern would undoubtedly result in the slowly dried clay balls lasting
longer. Indeed, a few of the expedient clay balls fell to pieces almost immediately upon removal
from the hearth, whereas most of the slowly dried balls were quite solid, but could be pulled apart
by hand with minor effort once cool.

Figure 47. Comparison of two clay balls. Upper panel: Scan of an impregnated micromorphology block showing a
clay ball in a feature exposed along the northeast wall of the block excavation in the lowest occupation
surface (Field Sample MM11). The margins and the interior edge of the oxidized rim of the clay ball have
been highlighted to facilitate viewing. Arrows point to the location of drying cracks where oxidation
penetrated into the core of the clay ball during heating. Note how the ball broke along drying cracks and
that less than half of the ball remained in the matrix. The other (top) two-thirds of the ball is missing and
was probably removed from the feature. Projection of the outer edge of the ball to a circular cross section
suggests the original clay ball was about 9.5 cm in diameter. Lower panel: Cross-section of a replicated
clay ball, made of clay derived from the paleosol that was allowed to air-dry several days prior to firing.
Subsequent to firing, the ball was embedded in polyester and then slabbed on a rock saw. As with the
archaeological sample, this photograph has been annotated to show the outside edge of the ball and the
inside edge of the oxidized rim. Note how the oxidized rim penetrates into the ball interior along
shrinkage cracks.

Figure 48. Side-by-side comparison of two clay balls made from the lower clay shown after they had been removed
from the hearth. The ball on the left was made a few minutes before being placed in the fire, whereas the
ball on the right was made several days before firing and was allowed to slowly dry. Note how the
expedient ball experienced more closely spaced cracks and considerable surface spalling during heating.
The slowly dried ball exhibits fewer cracks and significantly less spalling.

Internal Structure
The experimental clay balls all showed similar macroscopic internal pattern that consisted of a
thin orange rim near the outside margin of the ball, and a black or carbon core. Rice (2005) notes
that this color pattern in ceramics is due to the incomplete combustion or oxidation of carbon in
the core of the ceramic body (where it is black), and destruction of the organic matter near the
surface (where it is red or orange). Rice also notes that the lattice expandable clays (or smectites,
like the clays present at 41DL203) often hold onto carbon longer than do other clays.
Because the oxidized rim parallels the outer margin of the original ball, the arc of the outside of
the oxidized surface, or the arc of the carbon core, can be used to project the size of the original
clay ball before it broke apart, if one assumes the original ball was spherical. The Late Archaicaged clay ball shown in the top half of Figure 46 appears to have been about 9.5 cm in diameter
(slightly larger than the experimental ball shown in the lower half of the figure).
The experimental balls also exhibited penetration of the oxidation along macro-pores, such as the
shrinkage cracks. The Late Archaic ball (see top half of Figure 46) found in micromorphology
sample 11 (MM11) exhibited a similar pattern but clearly broke apart along the shrinkage cracks.
110

None of the experimental clay balls exhibited evidence of temperatures high enough to sinter or
vitrify the clay, and all of the experimental clay balls retained optical activity when observed in
thin section under cross-polarized light.
As noted previously, petrographic examination of the thin sections of the clay ball artifacts
suggested that the clay balls were not made from the clay that forms the site matrix alone.
Examination of thin sections made from the experimental clay balls confirmed this impression
and that both the lower clay and the paleosol lack significant sand-sized material and appear very
similar to each other in thin section but very different from the Late Archaic clay ball fragments.
Interpretation and Comments
Comparison of the macrostructure and microstructure of the experimental clay balls with the
burnt clay balls found within polyester-embedded micromorphology block 11 in the lowest
occupation clearly demonstrates that some of the Late Archaic burnt clay objects were the
product of clay balls that were probably used as thermal storage elements in cooking features.
The artifacts exhibit macroscopic internal oxidation patterns that are common in the experimental
balls, and they appear to have broken along shrinkage cracks, just like the experimental balls.
The Late Archaic ball fragments exhibit less black cores than the experimental balls, and this may
indicate that they were exposed to a high temperature environment for longer or on more
occasions than the experimental balls, which were fired only once. The size of the fragments
observed in micromorphology block 11 suggest that at least one ball was around 9.5 cm in
diameter and probably was dried slowly prior to heating. Petrographic comparison of the Late
Archaic clay ball and the experimental balls made from locally available clay at the site clearly
demonstrated that the clay balls were not made from this material, or if so, they were heavily
tempered with limestone sand (Figure 47) and that such sand is not present in the immediate
vicinity of the block excavation but may have been available in the Rowlett Creek channel at the
time of occupation.
Although the work done here does not solidly demonstrate the use of clay balls in hearths (as this
work is based on an analysis of a small number of ancient specimens), it does suggest that this
may have occurred. If given the opportunity to do this work again, it would be desirable to obtain
a larger set of the largest nonfiber-impressed burnt clay objects in context for study. Given the
friable nature of these artifacts, one approach would be to cut out a large collection of oriented
blocks from the occupation where they were common and embed these in polyester resin for
slabbing. This process resulted in the most convincing burnt clay ball, and it may be the most
reliable way to obtain clear samples for study. Second, given that clay balls used as thermal
objects inevitably break down upon use (like burnt rock) and would have been discarded, further
experiments should aim to compare the disarticulated fragments from experimental clay balls
with those obtained during excavation. The current experiments (which were not budgeted as
part of the project) represent but a first step toward understanding this process.
Fiber-Impressed Objects
Macromorphology and Micromorphology
The basic physical attributes of the fiber-impressed objects were previously described. What
appears clear is that the fiber impressions on these features occurred when the raw material was
plastic and presumably compressed on a grassy surface.
111

Petrographic examination of these objects revealed some commonalities and some differences
with the clay balls. Compositionally, the fiber-impressed objects contain a significant amount of
limestone sand, like the clay balls, and as such do not appear to be expedient features made from
the site matrix alone (Figures 49 and 50). In fact, the compositional similarity between the fiberimpressed objects and the clay balls is striking and they may very well be similar materials. The
majority of coarse material in the FIOs examined petrographically is gray, rounded to
subrounded, limestone fragments of medium to fine sand (0.42â0.12 mm), with the largest clasts
generally being coarse sand (approximately 0.7â0.8 mm), although one small gravel-sized clast
(3.8 mm) is a Cretaceous fossil bivalve Inoceramus sp. shell that has a distinctive cross-sectional
appearance (see the Inoceramid bivalve section, Society for Economic Paleontologists and
Mineralogists 2006; cf. Hill 1901:Plate XL). Some of the sand fragments are skeletal grains
derived from a range of Cretaceous-age fossil shells (e.g., foraminifera, gastropods, and bivalves
such as Inoceramus sp.) and many of these have a micritic shell and a microspar interior. Quartz
is also present in the form of rounded very fine and fine sand-sized clasts that range from 0.16â
0.04 mm in diameter.
Rubified (reddened) material is common in the fiber-impressed objects and these range from
sections of the micromass that have changed color (generally to 7.5YR hues) to others that appear
to have been sintered. Sintering is the first stage of vitrification where the clay mineral
crystalline structure starts to break down, these areas are optically inactive under cross polarized
light, and a uniform fine-grained micromass usually lacking carbonate grains and typically
exhibiting a more pronounced porphyric structure, begins to form(see Whitbread 1995 for stages
of vitrification of clays observed in ceramic petrography). The dramatic difference in appearance
raises the possibility that these are fragments of different material, but it is considered most likely
that this is just a thermal transformation of the clays. The presumably sintered materials are
clearly different from the rubified ones as the latter still retain optical activity and grains can be
observed going extinct when the sample is rotated under cross-polarized light. Furthermore,
some of the FIOs also exhibit small reddish brown (approximately 7.5YR 5/8) mottle-like spots
that range from 2.75 mm to about 0.24 mm in diameter and appear to be iron migrations of some
form.
The high degree of thermal alteration of the individual artifacts led us to examine samples found
in situ in order to search for evidence of thermal alteration of the substrate around and beneath
them. Several of the micromorphology blocks recovered FIOs in primary context. As can clearly
be seen on Figures 49 and 50 in the two clearest examples, neither exhibits any thermal alteration
of the surrounding or, most importantly, underlying substrate.

Replication Experiments and Methods
As noted previously, the experiment performed to replicate the fiber-impressed objects involved
the creation of a small platform that was divided into 50-x-50-cm squares that each were treated
to a suite of four processes (dumping, trampling, trampling soil on top of sod, trampling grass on
top of soil) and this was repeated for two different materials (the paleosol and the lower clay). At
the end of the firing experiment, the coals were removed from the baked platform and quenched,
and the platform was shallowly buried with earth and allowed to cool. Several days later, the
platform was exhumed and samples from each area collected. From these samples, a single thin
section was prepared for each process and material (a total of eight thin sections in all) (Figure
51).

sand temper present in the fiber-impressed object that is not present in the matrix. Note the absence of the
thermal alteration in the earth below the object, and the coarse sand fragments that are in the fiberimpressed object.

Only two of the experiments produced materials that resembled the fiber-impressed object
artifacts, and those were the two experiments where moist earth was trampled over and under
grass. The remaining experiments failed to reproduce the macroscopic form of the FIOs. The
results of the experiments are briefly summarized below.
Dumped
The fired surfaces created from dumped soil resulted in weakly lithified surface crusts that were
up to 3 cm thick and exhibited a very irregular upper surface. The surface irregularity was due to
the randomly oriented soil aggregates (or peds). The thin sections exhibited a very strongly
developed pedality that consisted of soil aggregates surrounded by voids, the majority of which

were simple packing voids. In thin section, these samples had a spongy appearance. Many of the
soil peds exhibited carbon cores, but this was most prevalent away from the fired surface. A few
rubified rock fragments were present in these samples. Neither of the dumped material samples
resembled the fiber-impressed object artifacts.

Trampled
The trampled surfaces created hardened fragments that consisted of a relatively smooth upper
section and a coarse subangular blocky microstructure in the lower section. The upper zone was
1â2 cm thick and exhibited a platy microstructure in thin section and some shrinkage cracks in
plan view. The lower section had a weakly expressed subangular blocky microstructure and
irregular patches of reduced matrix (carbon cores). No fiber impressions were present on either
of the experimental plots (lower clay or paleosol).

115

Trampled Soil over Sod
The areas that were trampled over sod, as did all of the trampled surfaces, exhibited a thin zone of
platy microstructure immediately beneath the trampled surface, but the surface of the trampled
zone lacked fiber impressions. One of the experiments (the lower clay) exhibited some fiber
impressions on the bottoms of the layer, but these surfaces were very irregular in terms of
topography because of the preservation of structural clods at depth, and the fiber impressions
were impressed into the clods. The clods were reflected in the thin sections by a distinct
subagular blocky microstructure at depth. The basal fiber-impressed surface bore some
resemblance to the upper surface of the dumped experiment in terms of microtopography and was
quite undulose over short distances. A few discrete areas of carbon-cored or reduced-color
matrix were present below the trampled upper zone.

Trampled Grass over Soil
These samples were the only ones to bear morphological similarity to the fiber-impressed object
artifacts and many of the resulting fragments recovered from the experimental plot sported fiber
impressions on the upper, trampled surface. The indurated zone was 3â4 cm thick and contained
two distinct microstructural units: an upper platy zone and a lower subangular blocky zone.
These samples exhibited a thin (< 1 cm) platy microstructure near the upper trampled surface, and
in one sample (the lower clay), a prominent horizontal separation occurred at the base of this
zone. The lower portion of these samples generally exhibited a subangular blocky microstructure
at depth, but the clarity of this varied between the two materials. Some carbon-cored (reduced or
black) areas were observed, generally within ped fragments.

Interpretation and Comments
As noted earlier, the fiber-impressed object artifacts are clearly not made from unmodified soil
derived from the occupation surface at the site, but rather appear to have had a significant amount
of limestone sand added to it. This results in a distinct petrographic difference between these
artifacts and the surrounding matrix in thin section, but this difference is apparent in macroscopic
as well as microscopic examination. Hand samples of the fiber-impressed objects fail to show
how well-fired these features are in reality, but this is immediately apparent from the thin
sections. The degree of rubification as well as partial sintering of the clay matrix suggests that
these objects were heated to a temperature of roughly between 1,472 and 1,652Â°F (Henderson
2000:132; Whitbread 1995).
Only one of the experimental procedures performed to understand these artifacts succeeded in
producing similar features, and this was associated with earth that was trampled under grass.
This procedure created fiber-impressed surfaces immediately beneath the fire that were oriented
up, just opposite of the orientation that was observed for large in situ fragments of the fiberimpressed objects at the site. The replication experiments demonstrated that surfaces fired in situ
exhibit gradational changes with depth and that from a single firing event this was generally 3â4
cm thick, which is significantly thicker (about twice as thick) as the FIOs. None of the
experimental surfaces examined revealed the degree of thermal alteration observed in the FIOs,
which indicates that they were heated to a temperature considerably higher than that of the
experiment. Unfortunately, the maximum temperature of the experimental fire was not measured.
116

Perhaps most importantly, none of the sediment beneath the FIOs that were observed in situ,
either in the field or in petrographic thin section, exhibited evidence of thermal alteration, which
suggests that these are not features that were fired in place but rather were heated elsewhere and
dropped here.
When reviewing the available evidence, Clayton Tinsley suggested that perhaps these features
were plastered thatched surfaces. Although the authors know of nothing like this in the
ethnographic or archaeological literature of this region, this hypothesis may be most consistent
with the FIO artifacts. Grass burns at a high temperature that could result in the degree of
vitrification observed in the artifacts, and a mud-plastered thatch could look something like these
objects.
A more detailed examination of the fiber-impressed objects and additional
experimentation with burning of a mud-plastered thatched surface may be informative. However,
the outer surface of a plastered, thatched surface should be smooth, and the inner surface should
be fiber-impressed. A rough outer surface could be created by spalling, or possibly even
weathering under rain. The amount of material recovered seems to be insufficient to represent a
structure, but possibly these are the remains of something like an arbor. Further experimentation
would be necessary to test these ideas.

CHAPTER 8
FAUNAL ANALYSIS

PART I: VERTEBRATE FAUNA
by Clayton M. Tinsley
Introduction
The faunal remains from 41DL203 represent one of the largest and best-preserved assemblages
yet studied from Northcentral Texas. The excellent preservation and sizeable collection allowed
for a level of analysis not common for the region. Although an extreme amount of marrow
extraction and thus fragmentation hindered certain quantification techniques (i.e., minimum
number of individuals; Lyman 1994), information concerning resource exploitation, butchery
patterns, and environmental conditions could be obtained from the current faunal collection.
Using information gained from AMS dating, lithic typologies, and sedimentation studies, the
faunal assemblage from 41DL203 was subdivide into four temporal phases: Phase 1 (250â160
cmbs), Phase 2 (160â100 cmbs), Phase 3 (100â85 cmbs) and Phase 4 (85â70 cmbs). Measures of
differential survivorship (i.e., taphonomy) were carried out on the assemblage as a whole and
within temporal subdivisions in order to assess human versus natural modifications to bone
surfaces. Every attempt was made to identify bone fragments to the highest taxonomic level
possible. Bone specimens not bearing diagnostic features but similar in size and other formal
characteristics were placed within specific size classes: small terrestrial mammal (STM),
medium terrestrial mammal (MTM), large terrestrial mammal (LTM), and very large terrestrial
mammal (VLTM). Assessments were also made of the following characteristics: bone element,
size/weight of fragment, fusion state, rodent gnawing, evidence of burning/butchery, and standard
metric analyses.
Sample Description
The total number of specimens from both the testing and mitigation phases of 41DL203 is 11,776
fragments, and the number of identifiable specimens (NISP) totals 2,923 (Table 11). A total of
25 percent of the entire 41DL203 assemblage was identifiable to either species or size class. The
vast majority of the collection was unidentifiable to any useful diagnostic criteria as is common
of faunal collections that have been collected via 0.25-inch screen mesh (Shaffer 1992).

A full 97 percent of the site assemblage is composed of fragments between 1 and 5 cm in length,
and less than 1 percent is larger than 10 cm (Table 12). The bias in favor of fragments in the
range of 1â5 cm is typical of collections screened with 0.25-inch mesh (Lyman 1994; Shaffer
1992). In addition to recovery method bias, the smaller fragment size is also a function of the
extreme amount of good preservation, intentional bone fragmentation during butchery, and
marrow extraction.

Other attributes recorded within the collection include the number of fragments with evidence of
burning, rodent gnawing, and human butchery. Only 600 fragments out of 11,776 showed any
evidence of burning (Table 13). Roughly equal numbers of blackened and calcined fragments
outnumber the lesser amount of bone fragments that exhibited scorching. Rodent gnawing (Table
14) and butchery cut marks (Table 15) were comparably rare within the 41DL203 assemblage.
The taxa represented at 41DL203 is typical for riparian/prairie edge environments and includes
large mammals such as bison and white-tailed deer; small mammals such as beaver, bobcat,
raccoon; as well as box turtle, rabbit, and a range of avian species (Table 16).
Overall, the faunal assemblage from 41DL203 is well preserved with minimal nonhuman
attritional bias. The large number of identifiable specimens allows for a basic discussion of
resource exploitation and past environmental conditions.

Resource Exploitation
Although a range of species is represented within the faunal collection, clearly, only a few were
of economic importance throughout time. White-tailed deer and turtle are represented in each of
the four phases and represent sizeable percentages (by number of fragments) of each sample
(Table 17). The cottontail rabbit contributed a small but steady percentage of identifiable
fragments through time. Other well-represented species, such as the cotton rat (Sigmodon
hispidus), are believed to be intrusive within 41DL203. Although represented by few fragments,
bison are present in all four phases, but their dietary contribution is underrepresented when
quantifying faunal material via numbers of fragments and weight of bone.

With respect to the most economically important species, deer and bison appear to be the only
species that would have both provided significant amounts of calories and not be incidental
hunting encounters, as is the case with many of the other species represented in the collection.
The paucity of bison remains makes it difficult to go beyond a basic qualitative discussion of their
importance and usage. The few bison elements to survive include skull fragments, teeth,
phalanges, tarsals, and sesmoids. These elements, although few in number, suggest a primary
butchery waste profile, which typically includes skull and lower leg remains. Meat-rich bison
elements from the axial skeleton and upper limbs were absent from the 41DL203 assemblage.

White-tailed deer remains are well represented throughout all phases of the site with consistency
(Table 17). Collectively, the deer remains from the four phases reveal a pattern similar to that of
the bisonâprimary butchery waste. Figure 52 graphically displays identified white-tailed deer
elements recovered from 41DL203. Cranial and limb elements are abundant, but the axial
skeleton is not represented. This pattern is consistent with primary butchery waste, as elements
are dominated by phalanges and lower limb bones. The more distal the limb element, the more
represented it is within the collection. Metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges dominate the deer
elements from the site and this is a pattern that holds through time within each phase (Figure 53).
Although element representation within the white-tailed deer assemblage through the phases
appears to have broad similarities (suggesting primary butchery), further analysis reveals some
subtle differences in the way carcasses were processed. Spiral fractures (as part of marrow
extraction) were noted in all phases for deer remains, but they were more numerous in Phase 1
and Phase 4. Overall, the percentage of material showing evidence of spiral fractures is increased
in both phases (1 and 4) and also reveals a more pronounced focus on marrow-poor elements
(e.g., phalanges) (Figure 54).
Whether this pattern of increased spiral fracturing of elements within Phases 1 and 4 reflects
differing butchery strategies or perhaps dietary stress is difficult to assess. However, Phases 1
and 4 also have the lowest percentages of tertiary species such as turtle, which might suggest
possible environmental changes (more xeric) in those phases.

Other than the change in white-tailed deer marrow extraction noted above in Phases 1 and 4,
resource exploitation within the vertebrate fauna was broadly similar throughout the four phases
of 41DL203. The assembledge (from multiple locations within the APE) suggests large prey
species such as deer and bison were the primary focus of hunting activities initiated from the site.
Large prey animals were killed in proximity to the site, with initial carcass processing undertaken
within site activity areas, and then were transported (presumably) to more permanent residential
bases. Four fetal/neonatal white-tailed deer elements provide the only seasonality data from the
faunal collection. Fetal/neonatal deer remains would be consistent with late spring through
summer hunting.

Environmental Reconstruction
The vertebrate fauna from 41DL203 permits a basic discussion of past environmental conditions
but precludes any specific discussion of changes through time at the site. Changes in faunal
species through time are either minimal or difficult to discern due to inadequate sample sizes.
Within the primary species, white-tailed deer are well represented though the four phases, and
bison have a small but consistent presence through time. The overall bison sample is small, but
its consistency through time is interesting in light of regional research that often implies a bison
population increase during the Late Prehistoric in Northcentral Texas and the Southern Plains
(e.g., Dillehay 1974; Lynott 1981). However, certain environmentally sensitive species such as
turtle fluctuate in numbers through the phase samples, suggesting a degree of
environmental/vegetation change.
With regard to environmental reconstructions, due to the above-mentioned issues with taxa
similarities through time, the 41DL203 faunal assemblage only allows for a general impression of
conditions through the siteâs use history. The suite of vertebrate taxa represented within the
41Dl203 faunal assemblage is consistent with a riparian environment located within a prairiedominated region. Collectively, the specifically riparian taxa (e.g., box turtle) are predominantly
125

associated with stands of deciduous trees, which, in the case of the native Blackland Prairie of
Northcentral Texas, would only occur adjacent to a watercourse such as Rowlett Creek. Used as
a proxy for tree cover, box turtle percentages are lowest for the two phases that botanical
evidence suggests would have had less dense tree coverage. According to the botanical evidence,
Phase 1 would have been characterized as mostly open with little tree coverage, but Phase 4
would have been a mature stand of hardwoods with an open canopy. Although the Phase 1
possible environmental conditions would not have been conducive to box turtles, the Phase 4
suggested environment would have, unless the riparian tree stand was being actively reduced
through xeric conditions.

PART II: MOLLUSCAN FAUNA
by Charles Randklev and Steve Wolverton Ph.D.

Introduction
Molluscan specimens are counted using two quantitative units: NSP (number of specimens
[identified and unidentified]) and NISP (number of identified specimens) (Lyman 1994).
Because samples are small, MNI (minimum number of individuals) is not calculated. A sizeable
portion of remains from the sample is fragmented and cannot be identified to taxon or element
(see systematic paleontology below). A complete record of faunal specimen identifications is
provided in Appendix A, which is summarized in Table 18.

Taphonomy
Two characteristics of mussel shells drive whether or not shell remains preserve: shape and
structure (Wolverton et al. in review). The more spherical the shell of a species, regardless of its
shell density (structure), the more likely it is to preserve. In addition, the more dense that the
shell of a particular species is, the more likely it is to preserve its shape. The shellfish fauna from
41DL203 is well preserved, but preservation varied over time at the site. The presence of species
with shells that are nonspherical and low in density such as members of the genus Toxolasma and
the high abundance of remains of Uniomerus tetralasmus indicate good preservation of shellfish
remains at the site. In addition, species with shells that exhibit relatively robust morphology in
terms of shape and structure, such as Amblema plicata, are common at the site.
Taxonomic richness of mussel species (NTAXA) changes over time at 41DL203 (Table 19);
however, this pattern cannot be interpreted as subsistence change or environmental change.
There is a close association between sample size (NISP or NSP) and NTAXA across temporal
assemblages at the site. Further, intensity of fragmentation, as measured by a ratio of NSP to
NISP (the higher the value, the more common are small unidentifiable fragments [Lyman 1994]),
associates one-to-one with taxonomic richness. It is commonly understood in zooarchaeology
and ecology that species richness increases with sample size and that identifiability of specimens
relates to preservation (Lyman 2008). Sample size and differential preservation across these
assemblages appear to drive taxonomic abundance and richness, thus changes through time
should not be interpreted as related to subsistence adaptation and/or environmental change in
streams. Although taphonomy precludes detailed temporal analysis of environmental change, an
attempt is made to reconstruct the late Holocene aquatic environment near 41DL203 below.

Systematic Taxonomy
Specimens are assigned to class, order, suborder, family, genus, and species according to their
identifiability. Identifications were made using taxonomic references (Howells et al. 1996;
Parmalee and Bogan 1998) and through comparison to reference specimens housed at the Elm
Fork Heritage Museum at the University of North Texas.
Phylum Mollusca (molluscs)
Class Bivalvia (bivalves)
Order Unionoida (freshwater mussels)
Family Unionidae (pearly mussels)
Genus Amblema
Amblema plicata (threeridge)
NISP: 80
Remarks: Specimens identified as A. plicata are heavy-shelled and characterized by the presence
of three to seven ridges, which run diagonal to the ventral margin. The pseudocardinal teeth for
these specimens are also diagnostic: the left valve contains two large, divergent, grooved,
triangular pseudocardinal teeth; the right valve has one elevated, grooved, triangular
pseudocardinal tooth. Threeridge is a robust species, tolerant of drought and low water quality,
and may inhabit both lakes and streams (Howells et al. 1996). Individuals for this species were
elongated and compressed, which is indicative of lotic (flowing water) systems with moderate
flow. Three of the 80 valves appear to have been burned.
Genus Lampsilis
Lampsilis hydiana (Louisiana fatmucket)
NISP: 6
Remarks: Shells of Lampsilis hydiana are often large, swollen, and rhomboidal or oblong in
shape. The umbo is raised above the hinge line with a moderately deep beak cavity. The
pseudocardinal teeth for both the right and left valves tend to be more massive compared to other
species within this genus. The depth of beak cavity and the size of the pseudocardinal teeth were
used as diagnostic features to identify this species. Individuals for this species were compressed,
which is indicative of streams and rivers with moderate flow. Lampsilis hydiana is tolerant of
both lentic (still water) and lotic systems and can adapt well to no or low flow conditions
(Howells et al. 1996).
Lampsilis teres (yellow sandshell)
NISP: 22
Remarks: Shells of yellow sandshell are thick, moderately inflated, and elongated. Unlike L.
hydiana, the dorsal and ventral margins are nearly straight and the umbo is only slightly elevated
above the hinge line; the beak cavity is fairly shallow. The pseudocardinal teeth are compressed
and less massive than other species within this genus. Shell ornamentation for both L. hydiana
and L. teres consists of only a few indistinct ridges, which is useful for differentiating both
species from Ligumia subrostrata. Yellow sandshell is intolerant of environmental perturbations
and frequent dewatering, and is found only in lotic habitats (Howells et al. 1996).

128

Lampsilis spp.
NISP: 8
Remarks: Individuals that shared diagnostic morphological features between L. hydiana and L.
teres were classified as Lampsilis spp. In addition, shells that were badly fragmented but had
pseudocardinal teeth that were clearly representative of the genus Lampsilis were also categorized
as Lampsilis spp. One of the eight umbos was burned.
Genus Plectomerus
Plectomerus dombeyanus (bankclimber)
NISP: 8
Remarks: Specimens identified as P. dombeyanus are heavy-shelled and rhomboidal in shape
with a pronounced posterior ridge that extends from the ventral margin and terminates near the
umbo. Shell ornamentation in the form of pustules and tubercles is restricted to the beak area and
is useful for differentiating this species from Quadrula verrucosa. The pseudocardinal teeth for
these specimens are diagnostic as well: the left valve contains two large, divergent, grooved
pseudocardinal teeth separated by a shallow notch; the right valve has one elevated, grooved,
pseudocardinal tooth with an anterior and posterior denticle. Bankclimber is often found near the
banks or shallow areas of large, slow flowing rivers (Howells et al. 1996). The presence of P.
dombeyanus is significant because it is found only in prehistoric assemblages for Northcentral
Texas.
Genus Pleurobema
Pleurobema riddellii (Louisiana pigtoe)
NISP: 3
Pleurobema cf. riddellii (Louisiana pigtoe)
NISP: 4
Remarks: Shells of Pleurobema riddellii are rather thick and solid, inflated near the central disk,
and triangular to quadrate in outline. The surface of the shell is smooth with no ornamentation,
which is useful for differentiating this species from others in the genus Quadrula. Shell
ornamentation in the form of three to four undulations that form parallel V-shaped ridges is useful
for differentiating individuals for this species from Fusconaia flava and Quadrula mortoni. The
presence of a well-defined posterior ridge that is keel-shaped is also diagnostic. Although P.
riddellii and Pleurobema friersoni have been synonymized (Howells et al. 1996) individuals from
41DL203 closely resemble the latter. Identifications were made by comparison with specimens
collected from the lower Sabine River and Wrightâs (1896) original description of P. friersoni.
Louisiana pigtoe is considered extremely rare today and is considered threatened by the American
Fisheries Society (Howells et al. 1997). This species occurs in small to medium-sized rivers with
slow to moderate flows.
Genus Quadrula
Quadrula verrucosa (pistolgrip)
NISP: 2
Remarks: The shell of Quadrula verrucosa is thick, elongated, and rhomboidal in shape. The
surface of the shell is covered with pimples, pustules, and small tubercles that are diagnostic. The
umbo is slightly elevated above the hinge line, which is useful for differentiating Q. verrucosa
from bankclimber. The pseudocardinal teeth are diagnostic as well: the left valve contains two
large, divergent, serrated, triangular pseudocardinal teeth, which may be oblique to one another;
the right valve has one elevated, grooved, triangular pseudocardinal tooth with only an anterior
129

denticle. Pistolgrip is a lotic species found often in riffles, but may also tolerate slow flowing
rivers (Howells et al. 1996). Like other lotic species, pistolgrip is intolerant to environmental
disturbance.
Genus Toxolasma
Toxolasma parvus (lilliput)
NISP: 1
Remarks: Toxolasma parvus is a small species usually less than 30 mm in shell length. The shell
is solid and subelliptical in outline and often quite inflated compared to other species in this
genus. The anterior and posterior ends are evenly rounded and the ventral and dorsal margins are
nearly straight which is diagnostic. Sculpturing on the beak consists of 5-6 relatively strong,
subconcentric, distinct bars which is useful for differentiating this species from Toxolasma
texasiensis. The Lilliput is found typically in the shallows of lakes, ponds and in small to large
rivers where there is little or no current (Parmalee and Bogan 1998).
Toxolasma texasiensis (Texas lilliput)
NISP: 2
Remarks: The Texas Lilliput is more elliptical and elongated in outline compared to other species
in this genus. Unlike T. parvus, shells for this species have a posterior ridge that is well defined,
and an overall shell that is less inflated. Beaks are low but full with ornamentation that consists
of 7-9 curved ridges which is unique for this species. Modern reference specimens were used in
addition to diagnostic morphological features to differentiate T. texasiensis from T. parvus.
Toxolasma texasiensis is found in both lakes and streams, preferring habitat with little or no flow
(Parmalee and Bogan 1998).
Genus Uniomerus
Uniomerus tetralasmus (pondhorn)
NISP: 55
Remarks: Shells of pondhorn are elongated, thin, and trapezoidal in shape. Beaks are diagnostic,
with 6-7 prominent concentric ridges that appear to radiate from a central point. The surface of
the shell is usually covered with elevated rest period ridges. The pseudocardinal teeth are useful
for differentiating this species from others with umbo ornamentation; the left valve has two
elevated, thin, widely divergent pseudocardinal teeth, where as the right valve contains one
pseudocardinal tooth that is triangular in shape. This species can become locally abundant in its
preferred habitat, and is adapted for desiccation, dewatering and stagnant water (Howells et al.
1996). Two of the 55 valves were burned.

Environmental Reconstruction
Prehistoric environmental conditions are reconstructed using Warrenâs (1991) computer program
UNIO (Version 3) for analyzing each of the four zooarchaeological mussel shell assemblages
from 41DL203. UNIO uses the ecological tolerances of modern species for stream conditions
and produces a reconstruction for the community represented archaeologically. Four variables
are examined: water depth, current velocity, substrate composition, and type of freshwater
habitat (e.g., lentic or lotic). Water depth is quantified between 0.0 decimeter (dm) to 46 dm (0.0
m to 4.6 m). Current velocity is categorized as strong âSW,â moderate âMO,â slow âSL,â and
standing âST.â Substrate composition is defined as cobble-gravel âC-G,â gravel âG,â gravel-sand
âG-S,â sand âS,â sand-mud âS-M,â and mud âM.â Finally, water body type is defined as large
river âLR,â medium river âMR,â small river âSR,â large creek âLC,â small creek âSC,â and Lake
130

âLâ. For each species examined, numerical weights (0, 0.5, and 1) are assigned based on
published habitat data, which are then graphed. For example, if a species is routinely reported to
occur in a gravel-sand substrate, a score of 1 would be assigned for that environmental variable.
Conversely, if a particular species is rarely documented inhabiting a gravel-sand substrate, then a
score of 0.5 is enumerated. Presence/absence (Taxa) values are multiplied by weighted habitat
variables and then summed across taxa within these categories. The result is a percentage of an
archaeological assemblage that is adapted to a particular habitat category (see Morey and
Crothers 1998 and Warren 1991 for discussion of UNIO). UNIO covers 133 unionid species
from the Mississippi basin but does not include two species found in the paleozoological record
from North Texas (e.g., Lampsilis hydiana and Pleurobema riddellii). For L. hydiana, Lampsilis
siliquoidea was used as proxy because these species share similar habitat requirements (Howells
et al. 1996; Parmalee and Bogan 1998). Pleurobema riddellii was omitted from the analysis
because little is known regarding its habitat or distribution (Howells et al. 1996).
The paleoenvironmental reconstruction using the four defined variables produces important
results. First, L. hydiana and P. dombeyanus are not known to inhabit headwater streams. In
fact, L. hydiana is considered an East Texas, coastal plain species that avoids headwater sites
found in northwest Texas (R. G. Howells, personal communication 2008). This suggests that
Rowlett Creek was at least a mid-order-sized stream. In addition, the water body preferences for
the majority of mussels examined from this site are medium- to small-sized rivers. The
percentage scores generated from the presence/absence data support the assumption that Rowlett
Creek was small to medium in size for the periods examined. Second, the majority of mussel
species prefer depths between 0.3 m and 1.2 m and decrease rapidly with increasing depth. This
interval follows a general rule that densities of mussel populations tend to decrease beyond 2.0 m
(Dillon 2000). This suggests that Rowlett Creek was moderately shallow for all examined time
periods. Third, a preference for slow-moving waters is observed in the analysis of current
velocity habitat preference. Toxolasma texasiensis, T. parvus, and U. tetralasmus are often found
in shallow, slow to still waters, or in protected parts of streams (Neck 1986; Parmalee and Bogan
1998). The presence of these species for all time periods suggests that slow-flowing conditions or
periodically flooded oxbow lakes existed near or at this archaeological site. Species such P.
dombeyanus and Q. verrucosa are also known to tolerate slow-flowing conditions (Howells et al.
1996; Parmalee and Bogan1998; Parmalee and Hughes 1993). Fourth, substrate composition for
all time periods appears to have consisted primarily of mud with some sand. All four time
periods yield over a 75 percent correspondence to mud substrate. The presence of P.
dombeyanus, Q. verrucosa, L. teres, T. parvus, T. texasiensis, and U. tetralasmus in the
archaeological assemblage suggests that substratum within Rowlett Creek was dominated by
mud.
Cumulatively, these habitat data indicate Rowlett Creek was a medium to small, shallow, slowflowing river with substratum dominated primarily by mud for all four time periods. The
presence of U. tetralasmus suggests that Rowlett Creek may have been intermittent during
periods of low rainfall or that small feeder creeks or temporary oxbows existed nearby. The latter
two explanations are more likely, given the presence of P. dombeyanus, Q. verrucosa, and L.
teres, as these species are intolerant of dewatering (Randklev et al. in review). That Rowlett
Creek appears to have been a moderately sized perennial stream during the late Holocene may
relate to a relatively mesic climate compared to the mid-Holocene in the region (Ferring 1995;
Ferring and Yates 1998). Species composition varies little between time periods, which suggests
that environmental conditions near this site remained relatively stable; however, taphonomic
processes likely affect taxonomic richness and weaken interpretation of the ecology of species
composition through time.

PART III: GENERAL DISCUSSION
by Clayton M. Tinsley

Vertebrate Fauna
Overall, the fauna from 41DL203 is consistent with a prairie-riparian ecosystem of Northcentral
Texas. Small terrestrial (e.g., raccoon, bobcat, and box turtle) and aquatic vertebrate species
(e.g., beaver and water moccasin) were closely bound to the perennial but slow-moving Rowlett
Creek, while larger species such as white-tailed deer and bison would have been less bound to the
stream but dependent upon it for water.
The 41DL203 assemblage is exceptionally well preserved and shows minimal evidence of
nonhuman taphonomic factors that are known to preferentially reduce survivorship. The
vertebrate collection is highly fragmented as part of butchery and marrow extraction procedures,
making advanced quantification measures (e.g., minimum number of individuals) difficult.
Regardless, a robust sample of white-tailed deer remains within each phase allowed for a study of
resource exploitation.
Based on NISP (and body mass), the most important prey species within the collection were
white-tailed deer and bison. White-tailed deer and bison were steadily represented within all four
phases. Elements from both species reveal patterns consistent with primary butchery waste. In
other words, the initial onsite processing consisted of beheading and removing the lower limb
bones. The meat-rich portions of the carcass were transported offsite to separate locations. Less
economically important species are represented by box turtles, Uniondae sp., rabbit, raccoon, and
a range of incidental species.
Seasonality data from the deer suggest a late spring/early summer occupation of the site. Based
on the available faunal evidence, 41DL203 appears to have been used primarily as a temporary
hunting camp during the spring/summer months. The location and use of this camp would have
likely been part of a regional settlement pattern that would have made use of both larger
habitation sites and smaller specialized extraction sites like 41DL203.

Molluscan Fauna
The mussel fauna from 41DL203 is important for two reasons. First, such good shell
preservation is rare, and as a result, several species that are not commonly encountered in
zooarchaeological assemblages in North Texas occur at the site (Randklev et al. 2009). The
fauna, thus, represents a bit of a taphonomic anomaly in that several species with fragile shells
(e.g., U. tetralasmus) are represented. Although preservation varies by temporal assemblage at
the site, as a whole the site assemblage represents a well-preserved late Holocene freshwater
mussel fauna. The second important characteristic of the fauna relates to taphonomy; good
preservation has resulted in an assemblage that is important in terms of late Holocene
zoogeography of mussel species in North Texas. For example, the presence of Plectomerus
dombeyanus is significant because it is found only in late Holocene assemblages for Northcentral
Texas and is absent today (Randklev et al. in review). Modern collections for this species are
restricted primarily to river drainages east of the Trinity River. Neck (1990) considered this
species absent from the upper Trinity due to intermittent conditions described by early
132

researchers. However, these records were after impoundment of most of the major forks of the
Trinity River. The identification of this species from multiple sites, including 41DL203, within
Northcentral Texas suggests that in general the upper Trinity was not ephemeral. The presence of
Pleurobema riddellii is also important because this species is considered extirpated from
Northcentral Texas (Howells et al. 1996). The type-locality for this species is near Dallas, where
it was thought to have been eliminated as result of industrial effluent being discharged into the
Trinity River. This species is considered extremely rare in Texas (Howells et al. 2007). Overall,
the unionid remains from 41DL203 reflect a late Holocene mussel community typical of a
medium to small, shallow, slow-flowing stream with substratum dominated primarily by mud.

Final Comments
Collectively, the vertebrate and nonvertebrate fauna from 41DL203 represent a well-preserved
sample that has allowed for reconstructions of past resource procurement/processing and
environment. Although not allowing for many interphase comparisons in procurement, a
noticeable increase in the intensity of marrow extraction was revealed in the early Late Archaic
and late Late Prehistoric periods (Phases 1 and 4). However, throughout all phases of the site,
large prey (white-tailed deer and bison) underwent primary butchery in proximity to the site, with
the meat-rich carcass being transported to another location offsite.
Both the vertebrate and molluscan fauna provide separate but complementary proxy measures of
the past Holocene environment of 41DL203. Collectively, these samples both reveal an active
riparian environment associated with a slow-moving, mid-order stream within the Blackland
Prairie of Northcentral Texas. Isotopic, botanical, and faunal evidence does suggest that this
riparian setting may have progressively undergone changes consistent with dryer environmental
conditions beginning in the Late Prehistoric period.

CHAPTER 9
LITHIC ANALYSIS
by Steve Tomka Ph.D.

INTRODUCTION
The Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) performed analyses of the lithic artifacts obtained
during Phase II testing and Phase III data recovery at 41DL203. The materials included
unmodified lithic debitage, and a variety of chipped lithic artifacts consisting of unifaces, bifaces,
projectile points, and a small number of ground/battered stone specimens. Shortly after the
receipt of the collection, CAR also received an additional sample of unmodified lithic debitage,
the contents of Feature 6, that appeared to be the discard of one or more lithic reduction episodes.
CAR conducted an analysis of 100 percent of the lithic cores and tools, including projectile
points; a random sample of 75 percent of the unmodified lithic debitage recovered from general
proveniences if feasible; and 100 percent of the lithic debitage recovered from Feature 6, a
possible lithic reduction feature.
The analysis was to address the following themes:
a) Definition of lithic tools into functional categories and description of each functional
category with illustrations of representative samples.
b) Analysis of projectile points, definition of types, discussion of type groups, and
illustration of representative specimens.
c) Classification of lithic debitage into raw material categories and the analysis of basic
attributes (including dorsal cortex presence/absence, heating, size category).
Broader questions to be addressed were to include the following: (1) implications of tool and
debitage attributes for the lithic reduction process at 41DL203 (e.g., Is tool/point production or
maintenance/reworking or a combination represented at the site? Are different processes
represented within different contexts?); and (2) Implications of local versus nonlocal origin of
tools and debitage (e.g., raw material availability and procurement, and the potential range of
mobility and/or exchange).
The materials from Feature 6 were grouped into three subsamples. FS 932 contained debitage
(n=1,846) from heavy fraction from a 2-liter sample of matrix. FS 933 contained debitage (n=51)
from heavy fraction from a 1-liter sample of matrix; and FS 934 contained debitage (n=26) from
heavy fraction from a 3-liter sample of matrix. The count of debitage from general provenience
totaled 2,859 specimens, based on counts provided by the Geo-Marine laboratory.
135

ANALYSIS METHODS

Defining Analytical Units and Sampling Strategy
As part of the scope of work for this analysis, CAR was to analyze approximately 75 percent of
the unmodified lithic debitage from general provenience. The reduction in sample was agreed to
in order to accommodate the analysis of the debitage from Feature 6 that was not originally
included in the counts of debitage provided to CAR.
The interim report of investigations (Dayton and Tinsley 2008) provided to CAR by Geo-Marine
clearly indicated that at least two distinct components were present at the site. Therefore, rather
than indiscriminately draw a 75 percent sample of unmodified lithic debitage from general
provenience, CAR staff examined the vertical distribution of all arrow and dart points recovered
at the site during testing and data recovery. The distribution of the projectile points into these two
broad categories is shown in Table 20.

points (n=1, 13 percent) but from 85â100 cmbs, dart points (n=5, 55 percent) are almost equally
as common as arrow points (n=4, 45), suggesting either the behavioral co-occurrence of the two
technologies and weapon systems or a mix of the two components. Finally, only one arrow point
was recovered from 100â250 cmbs, but the projectile points are dominated by dart points (n=52).
These patterns suggest that three lithic components may be isolable within the site by Phase. This
in turn prompted CAR to employ a lithic debitage analysis sampling strategy that randomly
selected 75 percent of the debitage from two individual phases (Phase 4, 70â85 and Phase 3, 85â
100) and from the combined samples of Phase 2 and Phase 1 ( below 100 cmbs). The results of
the radiocarbon assays support this division of the strata into these three lithic components (see
Chapter 6).

136

The initial counts of unmodified lithic debitage provided to CAR by Geo-Marine indicated that
the Phase 4 component (70â85 cmbs) contained 296 pieces of debitage, the Phase 3 (85â100
cmbs) had 403 pieces, and the combined Phase 2 and Phase 1 component (below 100 cmbs) had
2,323 pieces of debitage (Table 21).

The CAR staff identified and selected the 75 percent sample for analysis. As the analysis
progressed, it became clear, however, that as items within the unmodified debitage were
identified as tools or heat spalls or fire-cracked rock and excluded from analysis, the actual count
of unmodified lithic debitage was decreasing below the desired sample size. As a result, the
actual number of specimens analyzed from each component, and the total percent of the sample
analyzed is 72 percent (Table 21). It is, however, likely that the number of debitage recovered
from the site is less than 3,022 once all heat spalls and fragments of fire-cracked rock are
excluded. Similarly, a large number of retouched lithics were also found and extracted from the
debitage. One hundred percent of the debitage from general provenience was scanned for tools.
With these modifications to the original debitage provided to CAR, it is likely that the sample
actually analyzed by CAR is close to the 75 percent of the overall count.
As indicated above, the collection of lithic debitage from Feature 6 consisted of 1,923 pieces. Of
this total, CAR staff analyzed 1,009 specimens (52.5 percent). The remaining 47.5 percent
(n=914) measured less than 6 mm in maximum dimension and was not analyzed because they
were too small. The total unmodified lithic debitage from FS 932 consists of 957 specimens, 33
pieces from FS 933, and 19 pieces from FS 934.

Analysis Methodology and Attributes

Unmodified Lithic Debitage
Two distinct methods were employed in the analysis of the unmodified lithic debitage. A mass
analysis strategy was employed in the case of the sample from general provenience. In contrast,
the analysis of the debitage from Feature 6 was based on individual flakes. Mass analysis
involved the separation of the debitage from each lot or FS into raw material categories (i.e.,
quartzite, chert). Next, the debitage representing each raw material category was screened
through nested screens measuring 1, 0.5 and 0.25 inches. As a result, the debitage representing a
137

specific raw material category from each provenience was divided into four size classes, < 1 inch,
0.99â0.5 inch, 0.49â0.25 inch, and < .25 inch. The debitage within each size class was further
subdivided into corticate (1â100 percent cortex on dorsal face) and decorticate (0 percent cortex
on dorsal face) subgroups, and each of these was further divided into heated, not-heated, or
indeterminate heating subgroups.
Each piece of debitage derived from Feature 6 was analyzed individually. The analysis included
the identification of raw material type, cortex presence/absence (i.e., corticate/decorticate),
classification of each piece into 10-mm size categories (i.e., 1â10, 11â20, etc), identification of
heating (heated, not heated, indeterminate), and the assignment of each piece to a specific color
group. The color group assignments were based on the color and texture of the raw material, and
the cortex on corticate pieces. It is assumed that the color groupings are equivalent to individual
cobbles that were reduced to produce the lithic debris present within Feature 6. The debitage
measuring between 1 mm and 6 mm recovered from Feature 6 was not analyzed, although the
914 specimens were divided by color category (cobble) and packaged as such.

Tools and Cores
Bifacially flaked artifacts with shoulders and or barbs and having a stem were classified as
projectile points. No microscopic use-wear analysis was conducted of these artifacts, but it is
likely that they also served as cutting tools, not just the tips of projectiles. All bifacially flaked
nonprojectile point artifacts were classified as bifaces, and as a result, no bifacial core category is
employed in the analysis. That is, the core artifact category employed in this analysis includes
only flake cores.
Nonprojectile point bifaces that exhibited either manufacture failures (i.e., fragmentary) or knots
or humps resulting from failure to thin the artifact and lacked any evidence of macroscopic usewear were classified as miscellaneous bifaces. Only those bifaces that exhibited failures that
typically derived from use, were examined under 20X magnification for the presence/absence of
use-wear. Similarly, unifacially flaked artifacts that did not exhibit use-wear were classified as
miscellaneous unifaces. The majority of these unifacial artifacts was minimally retouched along
a single edge. The retouch was irregular and did not result in changes to the morphology of the
parent flake blank.
Debitage specimens that exhibited use-related modifications (i.e., microflaking along utilized
edges) were classified as expedient tools. When the microflake scars concentrated onto one face
of the utilized edge, the tool was classified as an expedient scraper.
Typically, a variety of raw materials occurs in lithic assemblages from sites found in Northcentral
Texas. Two raw materials are common within the examined assemblage: quartzite and chert.
Quartzite is a metamorphic rock consisting principally of recrystalized quartz (Bates and Jackson
1984:414). Quartzite is one of the more frequent materials in the collection and occurs in
varieties ranging from fine- to medium- to coarse-grained. Color variations range from yellow to
gray, but the most common variety has a reddish color. Cherts consist of opaque to partially
translucent cryptocrystalline or microcrystalline materials. The colors noted in the 41DL203
collection range from grays to tan. Interestingly, Bigfork chert, a dark green to olive green
opaque material that occurs in the western Ouachita Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma and in
the Red River gravels below the mouth of the Muddy Boggy and Kiamichi rivers (Tomka et al.
138

1999:66), did not occur in the collection. However, a dart point made of Pisgah Ridge chert is
present. This chert ranges from dark gray to grayish brown to black opaque in color and contains
microfossils that give it a speckled appearance. It occurs as nodules and small seams in the
Tehuacana limestone member of the Kincaid Formation (Banks 1990:52â53). Although the
Tehuacana limestone itself outcrops discontinuously over a distance of approximately 200 km,
the Pisgah Ridge source, about 6 km west of Richland, Texas, is the only known source of the
material. This source is approximately 70 linear miles from the approximate site location.
Novaculite, silicified wood, and chalcedony constitute the only other raw material types identified
in the collection of artifacts from 41DL203. Novaculite, a cryptocrystalline opaque material that
is distinguished from chert and chalcedony on the basis of a mottled appearance including red,
yellow, blue, and other colors, within a nontransparent base material, was also present in the
collections, but in small numbers. At least one piece of silicified/petrified wood, a material in
which the original woody structure has been replaced by cryptocrystalline quartz, is also present.
The piece is poorly petrified and is extremely coarse with imbedded fracture lines that prevent
cross-grain flaking of the material. One chalcedony artifact also has been noted. Chalcedony is a
cryptocrystalline translucent material composed of submicroscopic crystals. It ranges in color
from milk white to yellowish white. The specimen from 41DL203 has a bluish white color.
The presence/absence of heating of the raw materials employed in tool manufacture provides a
measure of the investment in raw material preparation by hunter-gatherer craftsman. It is also a
partial reflection of the quality of the raw material and its suitability for the manufacture of finely
flaked tools such as bifacial knives and projectile points. Typically, coarse raw materials are so
hard and have such poor flaking characteristics that they cannot be pressure-flaked with ease to
produce tools with sharp working edges and/or tools with thin/narrow hafting elements. To
determine, how frequently raw materials were processed by heat-treatment, the CAR staff
obtained a rather large coarse-grained quartzite nodule from the Geo-Marine staff. Several large
flakes were removed from this nodule, and one was flaked into a rather thick biface (75-x-60-x17 mm). The larger flakes and the biface were then heat-treated in a Thermolyne 1300 Furnace.
The heat treatment involved the heating of the flakes in a sand matrix and of the biface being
placed on top of the sand layer to 100Â°C. This temperature was maintained for two hours, at
which point it was increased to 250Â°C and held at this temperature for 4 hours. Unfortunately,
either due to the low temperature setting or the insufficient soaking time, little change was noted
on the outer surface of the biface and debitage. The only change was the acquisition of a reddish
and less lustrous tone to the outer surface of the material.
However, previous heat-treatment experiments conducted by Tomka using chert resulted in
dramatic changes in poor chert quality that were noted in two drastic changes in the material.
First, the outer surface of the raw material being exposed to heat became dull and often acquired a
reddish tint. Second, the inner surface acquired a luster that was quite dramatic in contrast to the
outer surface directly exposed to heat. Although the heating experiments could not replicate
these changes in the color and texture of the replicated flakes and biface, several artifacts from
the 41DL203 collection exhibit such changes. Figure 55a shows one face of the artifact (FS 831)
with a coarse and dull reddish surface near the tip of the artifact and a more fine-grained and,
under appropriate lighting conditions, a shiny surface exposed by flake scars in the lower half of
the artifact. The opposite face shows the reddish and coarse outer surface that has been only
minimally flaked. Figure 55b shows a yellow-colored, bifacially flaked artifact of fine quartzite
(FS 806). On both faces, the dull and coarse-grained appearance of the unflaked portions of the
artifact are clearly distinguishable from the fine-grained and more lustrous recent flake scars. It is
the opinion of the writer that these artifacts represent heat-treated specimens that have been
139

55. Heat-treated artifacts from 41DL203

subsequently flaked to expose the inner material. Based on these observations, artifacts (tools, as
well as unmodified debitage from Feature 6) that exhibited a fine-grained and lustrous appearance
or a combination of fine-grained lustrous and dull coarse-grained outer (dorsal) surfaces such as
shown in Figure 55, were classified as heated/heat-treated. Artifacts that exhibited only a finegrained texture but lacked luster or were coarse-grained were classified as not heated/heat-treated.
Finally, artifacts that had a luster but were coarse-grained or were fine-grained but had minimal
luster were classified as indeterminate in terms of heat treatment. The 75 percent sample of
unmodified lithic debitage from general provenience was classified as either heated/heat-treated
or not heated. That is, specimens that exhibited only luster or a fine-grained texture, but not both,
were classified as not heated rather than indeterminate.

Tools: Chipped and Ground/Battered Stone
A total of 217 artifacts, including projectile points, unifacial and bifacial nonprojectile point tools,
and miscellaneous bifacial and unifacially flaked artifacts, has been identified in the collection.
Other than projectile points, tools are present in low numbers. Miscellaneous bifacially and
unifacially flaked artifacts that exhibit no use-wear and likely represent manufacture failures
outnumber functional tools. Each category is discussed in greater detail below.

Projectile Points
A total of 71 projectile points and fragments was identified during the analysis. Of this sample,
arrow points constitute a small proportion (n=13, 18 percent), but dart points (n=58, 82 percent)
are present in relatively large numbers.

Arrow Points (n=13)
Of the 13 arrow points recovered, the most common types are Scallorn and Bonham, each
represented by four specimens. A single Fresno point was also recovered from the site. A rather
large, untyped, expanding stem/straight base arrow point with large flaring barbs also has been
recovered. The final three specimens consist of untypable arrow point fragments. Table 22
shows the vertical distribution of arrow point types within the site.

It is evident from the distribution of typed arrow points that a degree of vertical separation is
present even among them. For instance, the expanding stem Scallorn type is in general found
below the parallel stem Bonham form. In addition, the triangular Fresno type and the Bonham
types are the shallowest arrow point recovered from the site. The untyped expanding
stem/straight base form, which is similar to Scallorn and also the Catahoula type, is in the
uppermost level unlike the Scallorn specimens.

Bonham and Bonham Preform (n=4)
Three functional arrow points (Figure 56aâd) have been assigned to this type (Turner and Hester
1999:202). Two of the three functional specimens are complete, the third is a use-broken
proximal fragment. The preform, with a partially cortex-covered blade, is also complete but has
not been fully shaped. All four have short-shouldered blades and short parallel-sided stems and
rounded base corners. Blade edges tend to be straight to recurved.
Three of the four specimens are of chert, the fourth (FS 654) is of heat-treated fine-grained
quartzite. This pattern may be indicative of a preference for chert in the manufacture of these
points.
Fresno (n=1)
A single complete arrow point (Figure 56e) was assigned to this type (Turner and Hester
1999:213). It is made of gray chert with fossiliferous inclusions. The body of the specimen has a
matte appearance, but one edge of the point has relatively fresh flake scars that exposed a shinier

subsurface characteristic of heat-treated raw materials. Because the stem and the blade cannot be
reliably distinguished on this type, blade length actually represents total length, and blade width is
the same as base width in Table 23.
Scallorn (n=4)
Four functional specimens have been assigned to this type (Turner and Hester 1999:230). Three
of the four specimens are complete (Figure 56fâh), the fourth (Figure 56i) is a use-broken
proximal fragment. All four specimens exhibit fine serrations along the blade margins and likely
had sharp downward pointing barbs prior to breakage (Figure 56i). The barb breaks appear to be
the result of impact during use rather than manufacture.
Three of the four are of fine-grained quartzite. The proximal fragment is of banded chert. In
contrast to the Bonham points, this pattern may be indicative of a preference for fine-grained
quartzite in the manufacture of Scallorn points.

143

Untyped Expanding Stem/Straight Base (n=1)
A single complete specimen was assigned to this group (Figure 56j). It remains untyped because
although its stem is reminiscent of Scallorn points (Turner and Hester 1999:230), its large and
concave blade edges and flare at the shoulders are more typical of the Catahoula type (Turner and
Hester 1999:206). In addition, parallel-stemmed arrow points tend to postdate expanding-stem
arrow points, and this specimen was found in the uppermost excavation level, suggesting less
affinity with Scallorn points.
The point is of relatively coarse, tan-colored chert with small brown specks. One corner of the
expanding stem is missing. The break cause cannot be identified.

Dart Points (58)
Of the 58 dart points recovered, the most common types are Gary (n=35), followed by Dawson
(n=5), Yarbrough (n=3), Kent (n=2) and Godley (n=1) types. The remainder consists of two
untyped parallel-stem and 10 untypable dart point fragments. Table 24 shows the vertical
distribution of the typed dart points within the site.
The distribution of typed dart points indicates that the Dawson type clusters between 80 and 115
cmbs, with only one of the five specimens found at a lower depth. In contrast, Gary points occur
from 70â165 cmbs, but have two peaks: one between 120 and 130 cmbs and the other between
140 and 155 cmbs. Both of these peaks are below the majority of the Dawson points. The Kent
and Godley specimens are the two deepest types, occurring between 165 and 210 cmbs. Two of
the three Yarbrough points are deeper than the Gary type in vertical distribution and correspond
with the distribution of the Kent and Godley types.
Table 25 shows the vertical distribution of the untyped dart points and untypable fragments
within the site. The two untyped parallel-stem/convex base forms occur in the same levels as the
Gary points. The distribution of the untypable fragments mirrors that of other dart points within
the site.
Table 26 presents the minimum, maximum, and mean of the metric attributes measured on each
specimen. The number in the parenthesis shows the number of specimens on which the attribute
could be measured.
Dawson (n=5)
Four functional dart points (Figure 57aâb) and a preform have been assigned to this type (Turner
and Hester 1999:102). Three of the four functional specimens are complete, as is the preform.
The fourth functional specimen is a use-broken stem fragment. The preform is made on a flake
blank and has only minimal marginal retouch along the ventral face of the blank and a patch of
cortex on the dorsal face. The three complete functional specimens have short blades and
parallel-sided stems and rounded base corners. Blade edges tend to be straight. The shortest of
the functional specimens has a partially rejuvenated blade tip.

Four of the five specimens are of fine-grained quartzite, the fourth (FS 819) is of chert and has a
corticate base. The presence of cortex is a common trait of Dawson projectile points (Duffield
1963; Tomka et al. 1990).
Gary (n=35)
Thirty-five specimens are assigned to this type (Figure 57câg) (Turner and Hester 1999:123). Of
these, 20 (57 percent) are, or at one point in their use-life, were functional specimens. The
remaining 15 are preforms. That is, these dart points can be assigned to the Gary type based on
the morphology of the stem but were not functional because either they were broken prior to
completion or repeated step-fractures prevented the proper shaping/reduction of the specimen.

parallel-stem/convex base.

147

The 20 functional specimens consist of nine completed points, 10 proximal fragments and one
stem fragment. Four of the 10 proximal fragments were use-broken; break cause could not be
identified on the other six specimens. The stem fragment also was broken in use. The points
range from narrow (Figure 57c) to relatively broad-stemmed (Figure 57d) varieties and have
straight (Figure 57c) to moderately (Figure 57d) and/or heavily recurved (Figure 57e) blade
edges. Impact breaks are common on both the tips and the shoulders of the specimens (Figure
57fâg). The majority of the complete points have blades that measure 30 mm or more in length.
Only two have blades that are shorter (FS 606, 21.9 mm; FS 773, 23.4 mm). This fact is
mentioned in recognition of the argument advanced by some researchers (Webb et al. 1969;
Young 1981) that Gary points tend to decrease in size over time. The two specimens mentioned
above are from 100â105 and 120â125 cmbs and no trend for a decrease in projectile point size is
evident in the small sample of complete Gary points.
Seventeen of the 20 Gary points are of fine-grained (n=14) or coarse-grained (n=3) quartzite.
Three are of chert. They range in color from lightly banded gray, to tan with brown specks, to
reddish pink with dark red mottling. All three of the chert specimens exhibit massive impact
fractures (Figure 57g), but impact fractures on the tips of quartzite specimens are, in general, less
pronounced (Figure 57f). This pattern may indicate a reason for why the preferred raw material
for the manufacture of Gary points was quartzite rather than chert.
The 15 Gary preforms consist of 10 completed points, four proximal fragments, and one
longitudinal fragment. All five of the fragments were broken during manufacture. The
specimens range from those discarded due to breakage to those that never broke and progressed
into the later stages of reduction before the craftsman encountered difficulties in thinning the
piece and abandoned the production process. The preforms tend to be slightly longer than the
finished points (Table 26), but the main differences between the two groups (functional and
preforms) is manifested in terms of neck width, maximum thickness, and weight. In the case of
each attribute, the preforms have higher values than the functional specimens. This is expected,
given that the stems and blades of many of the preforms are not fully shaped.
Ten of the 15 Gary preforms are of fine-grained quartzite, and four are of the coarse-grained
variety. A single specimen (FS 936) is of chert. The chert ranges from coarse- to fine-grained in
texture and has a light to dark gray color with light blue to white fossilized inclusions. The cortex
present on one face is of brown color. This specimen is identified as Pisgah Ridge chert.
Godley (n=1)
A single complete dart point (Figure 57h) is assigned to this type (Turner and Hester 1999:125).
It is characterized by a relatively narrow expanding stem, slightly convex base, and small
shoulders. The blade is relatively short and appears to have been rejuvenated. It is made of heattreated fine-grained quartzite.
Kent (n=2)
Two dart points are assigned to this type (Turner and Hester 1999:136). They are characterized
by relatively narrow, parallel-sided stems and straight bases (Figure 57i). Blade edges are
straight and are moderately shouldered. One of the two is a functional specimen, but the second
148

is a preform that has a large knot on one face and unfinished stem and blade. The two points are
of fine-grained quartzite, and heat-treatment could not be established with certainty on either
specimen.
Yarbrough (n=3)
Three proximal dart point fragments are assigned to this type (Figure 57jâl) (Turner and Hester
1999:197). Two of the three are characterized by short, slightly expanding stems and slightly
convex bases (Figure 57jâk). The blades appear to be shouldered, although they may have been
barbed prior to the shoulder breaks evident on both specimens. One specimen (Figure 57j) has
been broken as a result of impact that removed the tip and both blade shoulders. The other
specimen (Figure 57k) appears to have been broken postdepositionally, although it may have also
suffered an impact fracture before the postdepositional break. The points are similar to the dike
variety of the type found at Belton Reservoir sites (Shafer et al. 1964:Figure 9-6eâg). At the
Yarbrough site, the distribution of points (Johnson 1962:Tables 2 and 3) indicates that Yarbrough
and Gary points occur in the same stratigraphic position. The stratigraphic position of two
Yarbrough points (165-210 cmbs) recovered from 41DL203 are deeper than the majority of the
Gary points recovered from the site (70â170 cmbs). One of the specimens is made of coarsegrained, tan-colored quartzite. It is the only specimen of this color in the collection, suggesting
that it is not of local-origin. The second point is of light gray to bluish chalcedony.
The third proximal fragment (Figure 57l) has a short parallel-sided stem and straight to very
slightly convex base (Figure 57l). The base has been lightly ground and the blade has one
moderate shoulder, but the other has been broken as a result of use. The blade edges are straight
to slightly recurved and exhibit some reworking. The tip of the blade has a small impact scar. As
in the case with many of the points from the site, this specimen also is of fine-grained quartzite.
The specimen appears to represent the lindale variety of the Yarbrough type (see Johnson
1962:173â174, Figure 9-6jâl). The provenience of the specimen (130â135 cmbs) is higher than
that of the other two Yarbrough points (165â170 and 205â210 cmbs).
Untyped Parallel Stem Convex Base (n=2)
A complete dart point and a proximal fragment are part of this untyped group. The complete
specimen has a short parallel-sided stem and convex base. Its blade is very thick, and one face
retains a patch of cortex. It is clearly an unfinished specimen that was discarded due to the
craftsmanâs failure to properly thin the bifacial artifact. The manufacture of the stem of the
specimen has not progressed sufficiently to allow for a typological assignment of the point. The
proximal fragment is characterized by a parallel-sided stem and rounded base, and narrow
shoulders (Figure 57m). This point was broken during manufacture as the knapper attempted to
thin the pointâs blade. The complete specimen is of fine-grained quartzite, but the proximal
fragment is of coarse-grained quartzite. The stem of the proximal fragment is reminiscent of
Axtell points (Turner and Hester 1999:76) but is not sufficiently rounded to assign it to this type.

Bifacial and Unifacial Tools

Bifacially Modified Tools (n=3)
Three bifacially flaked specimens are included in this category. One of the specimens (FS 678) is
a use-broken distal fragment that appears to be a dart point blade fragment. Although one margin
of the blade is also missing, the burin-scar-like break was likely caused by heat spalling rather
than impact. Because the fragment cannot be definitively identified as a dart point, it is included
in this category.
The remaining two specimens (FS 65 and 667) are rather similar in that they are both of coarsegrained quartzite, neither has been heat-treated, and both are rather thick (13.8 and 17 mm,
respectively). The complete specimen (FS 65) has an oval shape and one smooth, rounded end.
The smoothness is not only concentrated on the edge proper, but also extends onto both faces of
the artifact. The opposite edge also exhibits some edge rounding, but it is much less extensive.
Both faces of the artifact have numerous step fracture scars that represent failed biface thinning
removals. In addition, flake ridges on both faces of the artifact are also smooth, suggesting that
the edge smoothing and the smoothing of the face are related and may be the product of use.
The third specimen (FS 667) is a proximal fragment, so defined only because it appears to narrow
toward the opposite end. As in the case with the previous specimen, the edge appears to be
smooth but much less prominently. In addition, both faces of the artifact exhibit rounding and
smoothing of flake scar ridges, and some flake scar ridges on both faces exhibit use-wear polish.
The break morphology on the distal end is characteristic of snap breaks and may have been
caused by torque during tool use.

Unifacially Modified Tools (n=7)
Seven unifacial tools have been identified in the collection. They consist of six expedient
scrapers and one minimally retouched multifunctional tool. The six expedient scrapers are small
secondary (n=4) and tertiary (n=2) flakes with one/two edge(s) exhibiting use-modification. The
modification is in the form of 1â2 mm-long microflake scars formed from the use of the edges in
light scraping tasks. One of the tools has two edges with use-wear, the other five have one
working edge each. Five of the six are of fine-grained quartzite, the remaining specimen is of
chert. The seventh tool (FS 920) is a corticated fine-grained quartzite flake. It has minimal
retouch along two edges. The intersections of the two minimally retouched edges with a concave
use-modified edge form two sharp tips that have been employed as gravers. The concave edge
and the longer of the retouched edge were employed in the preformance of scraping tasks.

Miscellaneous Bifaces (n=108)
A total of 108 bifacially flaked artifacts was classified as miscellaneous bifaces. They do not
exhibit macroscopic use-wear on their edges and appear not to have been completed and used.
The principal reason for the discard of many of the specimens is manufacture failure. Failure
consisted either of breakage along imbedded fracture lines or of failure to thin the biface into a
finished artifact (i.e., presence of knots created by step-fractured flake removals).
150

Of the 108 specimens, one is from the surface and a second from a collapsed balk and neither can
be assigned to a component. Of the remaining 106, the majority (n=78; 72 percent) are from the
Phase 1 and 2 component, 21 (n=19 percent) are from the Phase 3 component, and only six (6
percent) are from the Phase 1 component. No differences were noted in the characteristics of the
miscellaneous bifaces by component; therefore, they will be discussed as one combined sample.
Forty (37 percent) miscellaneous bifaces are complete, and distal fragments (n=30, 28 percent)
outnumber proximal (23, 21 percent) fragments. Medial (n=6) and edge (n=8) fragments, and a
longitudinally broken petrified wood specimen make up the rest of the 108 miscellaneous bifaces.
Based on combination of attributesâincluding the presence/absence of cortex on one or both
faces, the complexity of flake scar patterning, and maximum thicknessâthe specimens were
categorized into early, middle, and late reduction stages. Early reduction stage specimens were
the most common (n=45, 42 percent), followed by middle reduction stage specimens (n=39, 36
percent). Only 18 (17 percent) late reduction stage specimens were identified, and six (5 percent)
fragments were too small to be assigned to any stage. The mean maximum thickness of the early
reduction stage specimens is 15.1 mm, and the middle (mean=10.9 mm) and late (mean=7.6 mm)
reduction stage specimens are on average thinner. Cortex is present on one or both faces of 39
(89 percent) of the early reduction stage specimens and 15 (37.5 percent) of the middle reduction
stage miscellaneous bifaces. None of the late reduction stage artifacts retains cortex.
The majority (n=72, 67 percent) of the miscellaneous bifaces are of fine-grained quartzite.
Coarse-grained quartzite specimens (n=24, 22 percent) are less common, as are bifaces made of
chert (n=11, 10 percent). The remaining artifact is of poor quality silicified wood. Twenty (19
percent) of the fine-grained quartzite bifaces are heat-treated, and the attribute could not be
determined with certainty on an additional 22 specimens. Thirty (42 percent) of the fine-grained
quartzite bifaces are not heat-treated. A single chert specimen (FS 757) was heat-treated, and
none of the coarse-grained quartzite bifaces appear to have been exposed to heat. Eleven
specimens (FSs 25, 92, 103, 394, 641, 655, 668, 672, 708, 806, and 831) exhibit dull and rather
coarse outer surfaces but fine-grained and somewhat shiny inner surfaces exposed in flake scars
(Figure 55).
Some of the specimens (FSs 394, 569, 605, 656, 667 [n=2], 682, 723, and 738) are made on small
flake blanks. They may represent arrow point blanks, although their vertical distribution is not
concentrated in the Phase 4 component (75â80=2; 95â100=6; 100â105=2), but rather in the Phase
3 component. A small number of other fragments (FSs 60, 361, 738, 805, 857, and 861) are
likely to be dart point fragments that cannot be assigned to a projectile point category because
they are missing the shoulders that would indicate that they were hafted artifacts. Their vertical
distribution is as follows: 70â75=1; 100â105=1; 100â110=1; 120â125=1; and 140â145=2).

Miscellaneous Unifaces (n=6)
Six fine-grained quartzite flakes and flake fragments exhibit minimal unifacial retouch but no
use-wear. These artifacts represent either the fragments of tools bearing no use-wear or were
broken in the manufacture of unifacial tools prior to completion and use. Two of the artifacts
(FSs 747, 857) appear to have been heat-treated and subsequently flaked.

151

Cores (n=20)
Twenty artifacts have been classified as cores. Because all bifacially flaked, nonprojectile point
artifacts are classified as miscellaneous bifaces, none of the cores are bifacial cores. Rather, 11
(55 percent) are classified as unidirectional, five (25 percent are multidirectional, and the final
four (20 percent) are bidirectional flaked cores. One of the unidirectional cores (FS 501) has
unidirectional flake removals from one end and battering but no flake removals on the opposite
end. Although the combination of these traits is reminiscent of bipolar cores, given the lack of
opposite-direction flake scars and the fact that the battering may be derived from a different
behavioral episode than the flake removal, it remains classified as a unidirectional core.
All of the cores are of fine- (n=14) and coarse-grained (n=6) quartzite. Half of the sample
consists of complete cores, and the other of fragments.
Battered Stones (n=2)
Two artifacts are grouped into this category. One (FS 773) is a small irregularly shaped quartzite
pebble. It exhibits extensive battering on two corners and light battering on one corner in
conjunction with light striations on two faces. Both the battering and striations are consistent
with the use of the artifact as a hammerstone. It is a rather light-weight specimen, weighing only
40.8 g. The specimen measures 55.2-x-44.1-x-40.8 mm.
The second specimen (FS 1043) is also a small quartzite pebble. It exhibits extensive battering
along one edge. The two ends also may have been used; however, weathering of the ends of the
pebble confounds clear identification of battering. Striations from the use of the hammerstone in
platform preparation are present on the two flat surfaces of the pebble. It is also a light-weight
specimen, weighing only 32.3 g and measuring 58.1-x-44-x-32.3 mm.
Unmodified Lithic Debitage
Debitage from General Proveniences
Four types of raw materials were identified during the analysis: novaculite, silicified wood, chert,
and quartzite. Because of the interest in defining any changes in lithic manufacture activities
through time, the remainder of this discussion will focus on patterning in attributes through time,
that is, by comparing the Late Archaic (Phase 1 and 2), Transitional (Phase 3), and Late
Prehistoric (Phase 4) components identified at the site. Debitage (n=228) derived from Levels
70â85 cmbs was considered part of the Late Prehistoric, samples (n=213) from 85â100 cmbs
were considered Transitional, and samples (n=1,611) from deeper proveniences were identified as
Late Archaic.
Table 27 shows the count of unmodified lithic debitage by raw material category and component.
Novaculite (n=4) and silicified wood (n=1) are combined to reduce the number of empty cells in
the contingency table. The table also shows the results of adjusted residual analysis that
determines which cells contribute to significant variation from random patterning in the counts in
each cell, given total sample sizes (Haberman 1973). Cells with values greater or lower than an
absolute value of 1.96 represent statistically significant deviations (at the 0.05 level of
significance) from the expected random distribution.

Quartzite is the most common raw material throughout the three components. However,
statistically significant differences exist within the cells of the contingency table. Chert debitage
is underrepresented in the Late Archaic and Transitional components but overrepresented in the
Late Prehistoric component. Conversely, quartzite is underrepresented in the Late Prehistoric
component and overrepresented in the two other components.
Table 28 shows the count of unmodified lithic debitage by size class and component. The two

It is evident that the size distribution of the lithic debitage is relatively consisted through time.
The 0.25â0.5-inch size class contains the highest number of pieces in each component, and
specimen counts decrease as size class increases. The only statistically significant pattern is the
underrepresentation of flakes smaller than 0.25 inch in the Transitional component.

No statistically significant trends are present in the contingency table.

Corticate debitage tends to outnumber decorticate flakes in all but the Transitional component.

*figures in parenthesis are statistically significant adjusted residuals

Heat-treated debitage is more common than nonheated specimens in all three components.
However, the adjusted residuals show that debitage that is not heat-treated is overrepresented in
the Late Archaic component and heat-treated specimens are overrepresented in the Late
Prehistoric component. This pattern of raw material processing indicates that Late Prehistoric
craftsmen were more likely to heat-treat the raw material than were Late Archaic knappers. In
light of the overrepresentation of chert within the Late Prehistoric component, the patterns seem
to imply that Late Prehistoric craftsmen preferred higher quality materials such as chert and,
given apparent limited access to chert sources, attempted to improve the quality of the local
quartzites though heat-treatment.
Finally, during the analysis of the unmodified debitage from general provenience, it was noted
that chert debitage appears to be more common in the deeper levels of the Late Archaic
component. To investigate this apparent trend, the number of chert debitage within the Late
Archaic component (100â190 cmbs) were compiled. The results show that the upper portion of
the component (100â120 cmbs) contains 15 chert specimens (25 percent) of the total 60 chert
flakes. In contrast, the bottom six levels (145â190 cmbs) contain 44 pieces (73 percent) of all the
chert debitage from the component. A single piece (2 percent) is present between 120â140 cmbs.
Interestingly, 27 percent (4 of 15) of the chert debitage from the upper portion of the Late Archaic
component is decorticate. In contrast, 43 percent (19 of 44) of the chert debitage from the deeper
154

portion of the component is decorticate. These figures suggest either a different chert reduction
strategy during the early and later parts of the Late Archaic or potentially different chert
procurement strategies and localities.
Debitage from Feature 6 and Minimal Analytical Nodule Analysis (MANA)
Minimal analytical nodule analysis (MANA) is a method of partitioning and organizing a chipped
lithic assemblage containing a large number of specimens that have identifiable material
differences (Larson 2004; Larson and Kornfeld 1997). Although similar to refitting, the intent is
not to reconstruct the reduction sequence or match all conjoining pieces, rather it groups like
materials into individual units that represent a single source unit of material. The assumption is
that when a nodule is reconstructed, it represents a specific episode of behavior occurring in a
brief period of time (Larson and Finley 2004). Carr and Bradbury (2001) propose a similar term,
the analytical core unit (ACU), which is a reconstruction of the number of cores at a site based
upon regression formulas applied to the weight and other characteristics of the debitage. ACU
differs from MANA because it is a measure of core use and reduction, and does not account for
cores being partially reduced and transported onsite and offsite: MANA measures the minimal
nodules in an assemblage, and recognizes that multiple trajectories for reduction such as flake
blanks, bifaces, and cores can be created from a single nodule.
The use of MANA methods can provide an indication of the technology practiced at a site, and
what may be over- or underrepresented in an assemblage. It can provide additional information
about possible mobility and trade and the exploitation of local resources (e.g., Hall 2004). Hall
used MANA to examine prehistoric land use, mobility and technological organization, and
Binfordâs (1980) technological organization. Imported or curated tools should not be reflected in
the debitageâthey may be discarded at the site but there is no debris related to the tool
manufacture. Larson and Finley (2004) note that MANA can be as difficult and time consuming
as refitting analysis, and if conducted improperly, it can obscure useful data. To minimize error,
they list criteria to improve the accuracy and validity of the grouping: (1) resorting multiple
times to determine the most cohesive units; (2) finding refits and conjoins within groups to
reinforce the analytical unit; and (3) additional information on raw materials, provenience
information, morphological, and chemical traits. The subjectivity is further reduced by using
other analysts to observe and critique the divisions.
Knell (2004) uses the method to investigate the Cody Complex component at the Hell Gap
Locality 5. By proposing several scenarios of raw material movement through the site, he
developed several testable hypotheses and the expected archaeological signature using two
classes of nodulesâproduction nodules, locally available and used for onsite tool production; and
transport nodules, previously reduced cobbles, cores, or bifaces brought to the site for tool
production. Each type of nodule or combination creates a different lithic assemblage.
Although the technique may not work on a homogenous sample, there was sufficient variation
amongst the quartzite from 41DL203 to categorize the feature assemblage. The technique is even
more applicable in this instance because of the nature of the feature, where a single or series of
stone-knapping episodes occurred in a short period of time.
Feature 6 was identified and documented during Phase III data recovery work at the site. It was a
20-cm-wide and 10-cm-high concentration of lithic debitage. The top of the feature was
encountered at 140 cmbs in a level containing Gary points and a depositional zone rich in Gary
dart points (e.g., 120â164 cmbs contained 24 of the 35 Gary points from the site).
155

Floatation of the Feature 6 matrix and subsequent analysis of the debitage revealed that the
feature contained 1,923 pieces. Of this total, CAR staff analyzed 1,009 specimens (52.5 percent).
The remaining 47.5 percent (n=914) measured less than 6 mm in maximum dimension and were
not analyzed. All of the debitage consisted of quartzite ranging in color from yellow to gray and
red. The analysis consisted of the separation of the debitage into homogenous color groupings
(i.e., cobbles) and the recording of cortex presence/absence and size (10-mm increments) for each
piece.
Twenty cobbles or color groups were established and 910 (90 percent) of the 1,009 pieces of
debitage were assigned to one of the cobbles. A definitive color group could not be established
for the remaining 99 specimens due either to the effect of heating/burning, small size, or lack of
fit into the 20 established groups. Table 31 shows the breakdown of lithic debitage by size class
within the 20 cobble groups.

Eleven (55 percent) of the cobble groups contain debitage that has not been heat-treated. Only
debitage from three cobble groups (8, 16, and 17; 15 percent of the cobble groups) appear to have
been heat-treated, although the presence of heat-treatment could not be determined with certainty
in the case of six cobble groups (5, 7, 10, 12, 18, and 19; 30 percent).
Overall, the 11â20âmm size class contains the largest proportion (46 percent) of flakes (Table
31). The smallest size class contains 23 percent of the debitage, roughly the same proportion as
the 21â30 size class. Flakes larger than 30 mm constitute a combined 8 percent of all the flakes.
These patterns in the overall collection mask a significant amount of variability at the individual
cobble group level.
Similar conclusions can be reached regarding the presence/absence of cortex on debitage derived
from the 20 cobble groups (Table 32). Overall, a majority (55 percent) of the lithic debitage is
decorticate, although corticate flakes and fragments also represent a significant proportion of the
samples. As in the case with the size classes, a large degree of variation is present at the level of
the cobble groups.
To explore the behavioral implications of the intercobble variability in debitage size and cortex
presence/absence, a couple of basic principles need to be kept in mind. When reducing a nodular
core into a bifacial artifact, on average, flakes removed early in the reduction tend to be larger
than flakes removed later, and the early flakes tend to retain cortex on their dorsal faces.
The longer the duration of the reduction sequence, the more flakes will be removed and the more
likely that flakes removed during the later part of the reduction will be smaller than previous
flakes and will lack cortex on their dorsal faces. The largest flakes produced during the bifacial
reduction of flake cores to bifaces tend to be smaller than the largest flakes produced during the
bifacial reduction of nodules derived from the same deposits. Regardless of the size of the flakes,
decorticate flake cores will produce only decorticate flakes throughout the reduction process. The
rejuvenation of tools will produce few pieces of debitage, and these specimens will be small and
decorticate.
To investigate intercobble variability in lithic reduction strategy, the proportion of debitage
grouped into two broad size categories and the proportion of decorticate debitage in each cobble
group were studied. Table 33 presents this data.
It is evident from Table 33 that the reduction of most of the cobble groups do not meet
expectations. For instance, it was suggested earlier that typically during the bifacial reduction of
nodular cores, as the length of reduction increases (i.e., the number of flakes), the percentage of
decorticate debitage should also increase. Conversely, the shorter the reduction sequence, the
lower the percentage of decorticate debitage produced. The debitage collections from some of
the 20 cobble groups do not meet these expectations. For instance, the seven cobble groups with
the highest sample sizes (2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, and 18) have a mean 37.7 percent decorticate debitage.
In contrast, the six cobble groups with the smallest sample sizes (3, 6, 8, 14, 19, and 20) have a
mean of 65.2 percent decorticate flakes. These reduction episodes (with highest sample sizes)
may have begun with secondary flake blanks rather than nodules, resulting in the production of
higher numbers of decorticate flakes. Alternatively, the cobble groups with the smallest samples
may represent failed reduction sequences that did not produce middle to late reduction stage
bifaces or perhaps core reduction episodes in which the principal goal was the production of flake
blanks for expedient tools.

In summary, the lithic debitage recovered from Feature 6 is the product of a variety of reduction
strategies including the bifacial reduction of nodular cores, corticated flake cores and either failed
reduction episodes or core reduction rather than biface manufacture. The feature comes from a
depositional unit rich in Gary points and preforms and is composed entirely of quartzite debitage,
a common raw material employed in the manufacture of Gary dart points.

ANALYSIS OF THE CHERT ARTIFACTS FROM 41DL203
The entire lithic assemblage was examined for chert lithic debitage, miscellaneous bifaces, tools,
and projectile points. The project area is located in a Northcentral Texas region identified as
âchert poor,â especially when compared with Central Texas (e.g., Banks 1990; Ferring and Yates
1997; Mauldin and Figueroa 2006). Even in âchert-richâ areas of Central Texas, chert, both in
quantity and quality, is unevenly distributed (Frederick and Ringstaff 1994).

A search of the regional literature from previous archaeological projects that include large-scale
reservoir surveys and excavations in Northcentral and Northeast Texas consistently note the lack
of locally occurring chert and the abundance of quartzite and the use of petrified wood (Ferring
and Yates 1997; Fields et al.1997, McGregor et al. 1996; Prikryl 1990; Skinner and Baird 1985).
Yet, chert artifacts are found throughout sites, although in varying, lesser, percentages than
quartzites. An analysis of the Uvalde gravels estimated they were 90 percent quartzite and 10
percent chert (Prikryl 1990), a number repeated in other studies (Todd and Skinner 2005). It is
unknown whether the 9:1 ratio evenly occurs because there has been no systematic collection and
analysis of the gravel content in the current project area. Uvalde gravels were encountered along
upper terraces and upland divides during the survey for Aquilla Lake in Hill County. Based on
the composition and appearance of the gravels, Patton (1987) determined they were the same
Uvalde gravel formation, deposited during the Pliocene-Early Pleistocene. The gravels are the
remnants of the eroded surrounding alluvium and till.

159

During the investigations of Lake Ray Roberts in Denton County (Ferring and Yates 1997), local,
regional, and exotic lithic resources were identified. Local resources included those materials
from Tertiary gravels adjacent to sites, such as quartzites in what were termed Ogallala gravels.
Immediately to the west and in the gravels of larger drainages such as Denton Creek and the West
Fork Trinity, chert is present in varying percentages and types. These cherts are also found with
Pennsylvania rocks and can resemble Edwards cherts (Ferring and Yates 1997:29). For their
analysis, exotic cherts were assumed to be Edwards cherts, which were rare in the assemblages.
The difficulty of identifying exotic cherts is compounded by the diverse range of color and other
physical traits within the cherts of the Edwards Formation. Edwards-like cherts are found in a
variety of gravel formations, particularly the Uvalde gravels. Uvalde gravels, more common
along the drainages on the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau, also occur as lag deposits at
higher elevations and in reworked alluvial deposits (McGregor et al. 1982). These gravels are
also associated with the quartzite gravels referred to as the Ogallala formation (Byrd 1971),
which contains chert and other cryptocrystalline materials (Frye and Swineford 1947).
Byrd (1971) attempted to standardize and refine the definition for the Uvalde gravels. Uvalde
gravels occur in irregular patches above terraces and along divides and consist of water-worn
cobbles ranging from pea-sized to boulders. Geographically, they extend from Tarrant and Dallas
counties in the north southward into Mexico. For the most part, Uvalde gravels have no direct
association with the underlying geology of the present location and predate the Quaternary
alluvial systems in Texas. The thickness of the deposits is greater to the east and increases south
of the Balcones fault zone. In the north, near Dallas, they are found in discontinuous bands and
gravel veneers. To the south, in Travis County, deposit thickness was measured at 20 feet, and
toward the southeast, in Caldwell County, terrace deposits increased to 30 feet in thickness.
Although they were deposited before the current river system existed, Uvalde gravels have
subsequently been reworked by alluvial forces.
Uvalde gravels were likely deposited during the Late Pliocene. Various parent or source
materials may occur in the Uvalde gravels and include prior alluvial and glacial deposits from the
eastern edge of the Rockies that were deposited in West Texas and New Mexico (Byrd 1971).
The siliceous material such as the quartzite, chert, and petrified wood found in Uvalde gravels
may have been derived from the Ogallala Formation, whose deposition predates the Uvalde
gravels. The Ogallala Formation occurs from Nebraska to the Texas Panhandle and West Texas,
and formed during the Late Miocene from eolian and alluvial activity (Frye and Swineford 1947).
During transport of Uvalde gravels into Central Texas, erosion of the Ogallala Formation in West
Texas contributed siliceous materials to the gravels.
The one artifact that is made from a previously identified chert is a Gary preform (FS 857), made
from Pisgah chert. The primary source for this chert is in Navarro County, an outcropping in the
Tehuacana Limestone named Pisgah Ridge. The same member outcrops in Kaufman County;
however, no chert has been recorded from that locale or from lag or alluvial deposits (McGregor
et al 1982:67).

Lithic Chert Assemblage
More than 90 percent of the lithic material is quartzite, and chert represents 3.4 percent of the
material in the lithic debitage and tool assemblage at site 41DL203. The assumption for the lack
of chert in the assemblage is directly related to local availabilityâthe site is located in a âchert160

poorâ region and the chert at the site is nonlocal and therefore was imported. Chert resources are
known locally in the form of gravels such as the Uvalde and Ogallala gravels that occur in
drainages and upland divides. Nonlocal sources include Edwards cherts from Central Texas and
cherts that share characteristics similar to those of Edwards. The lack of a systematic raw
materials inventory for the region and for most of Texas permits only generalities to be made
about raw material resources since there is no baseline for comparison and identification. It is
possible that the chert at the site is from several different sources and was obtained using a
variety of procurement strategies.
The material sources can provide information about the organization of technology, site use, and
mobility, and the lithic signature from the site should therefore reflect some of those decisions
and strategies. The model proposed by Andrefsky (1994) addresses lithic quality and abundance
and the expected archaeological signature resulting from the varying technological strategies for
formal and informal tool production, resulting in a contingency table (Figure 58). Other
researchers have found that the quality of available raw material dictates tool design and
manufacture (Brantingham et al. 1999). Other considerations include risk and tool design (cf.
Bleed 1986; Bousman 2005), and embedded mobility strategies (e.g., Binford 1980).

58. Contingency table showing relationship between raw material variables

Figure 58. Contingency table showing relationship between raw material variables (after Andrefsky 1994).

(1) Chert is imported and nonlocal:
Expected archaeological signature: Chert debitage should be decorticate and from later stage
bifaces and maintenance or rejuvenating flakes from finished tools (e.g., Kelly 1988; Kuhn
1994; Parry and Kelly 1987). The chert should be high-grade material. Discarded tools are
broken from use or from late and final stage manufacturing or refurbishing.

161

(2) Chert is local:
Expected archaeological signature: Chert should increase relative to other materials in the
assemblage. As Andrefsky (1994) notes, the quality of the chert is a factor in its selection
and use. Cortex should be more frequent and found in a wider range of flake size-grades. A
wider range of tools may be made, and the chert resources may be a draw to the locale. A
greater exploitation of the local environment may also indicate decreasing mobility, leading
to greater lithic-diversity site-utilization increases.
The complete lithic analysis called for a sampling strategy where 75 percent of the unmodified
debitage was analyzed from the initial three Analytical Units (AUs.). Subsequently, a finer
definition of the AUs was allowed, and four divisions were used to examine the chert assemblage.
In this instance, 100 percent of the chert artifacts was analyzed. This increased the artifact count
for the deeper deposits (i.e. Phases 1 and 2). The new division allowed for a two-part Late
Archaic (Phases 1 and 2) and a two-part Late Prehistoric (Phases 3 and 4). The analytical units
with associated depths and potential projectile-style affiliation and radiocarbon dates are shown in
Table 34.

Chert accounts for 4.32 percent (92 of 2,115 pieces) of the examined debitage. Of the 58 dart
points, 7 (12.07 percent) are of chert, and of the 13 arrow points, 5 (38.46 percent) are of chert.
There are 10 (9.35 percent) chert bifaces from 107 specimens, and a single chert uniface from 13
(7.69 percent) specimens. From the complete chipped stone lithic assemblage of 208 tools and
cores, there are 23 chert specimens representing 11 percent of the tool and core assemblage.
When the new AUs were defined, certain excavation levels were not assigned to an AU. By AU,
there are 22 specimens, as shown in Table 35.

Chert occurs infrequently and is unevenly distributed throughout the AUs. To assess the
distribution, use, and possible sources of chert at 41DL203, the chert assemblage was compared
among site analytical units. The chert assemblage consists of 109 specimens. Examined in the
chert analysis are 87 pieces of debitage, 11 projectile points, 10 bifaces, and one uniface.
Debitage from deeper excavation levels that were not part of the initial debitage analysis sample
were included to examine lithic resources for the oldest analytical unit, the pre-Gary unit at levels
below 165 cmbs, thereby increasing the total debitage sample size 2,115.
In Figure 59, the overall chert debitage assemblage is plotted by depth and presence/absence of
cortex. The graph contains a sample with a depth of 130â155 cmbs, the result of balk cleaning.
Beginning in the deepest component, Phase 1, only one fragment of debitage has cortex. Phase 2
is characterized by the Gary point assemblage and Feature 6, an exclusively quartzite feature.
Chert usage is greatest at the beginning of this analytical unit, from 145â160 cm, accounting for
35 specimens, (36 percent) of the chert debitage, and ann increase in cortex from zero percent to
58 percent. Toward the end of Phase 2, from 105â110 cmbs, there is another peak in chert, with
75 percent of the chert having cortex.
In Table 36, the presence and type of cortex is compared by AU. The presence and
characteristics of the cortex are potential indicators of the raw material source, size of the raw
material, procurement strategies, and mobility. Overall, river cobbles account for 56 percent of
cortex, weathered cobbles for 21 percent, and indeterminate for 23 percent. During Phase 2 and
3, all three varieties of cortex are present, but in Phase 4, 16 of the 17 samples are river cortex,
suggesting a change in lithic raw material sources.

When compared with the size data, a greater range of size is found in Phase 2 and Phase 4 than in
the other units. Combined with the cortex data, it suggests that local reduction and manufacturing
of chert tools was occurring onsite and that corticate material was being reduced during these
periods. In Phase 1, the chert debitage is from late stage or finished bifaces.
The Late Prehistoric analytical units (Phases 3 and 4) also differ from each other. During Phase
3, the Scallorn zone, one of the points is made from chert, and only a single chert flake is
associated with the analytical unit. In Phase 4, with the Fresno and Bonham points, chert
debitage increases to 30 pieces.
164

To evaluate further the variation between the Scallorn (Phase 3) and post-Scallorn (Phase 4)
debitage assemblages, the quartzite debitage was compared. The major differences between the
two analytical units are the greater number of small flakes from the 0.125-inch size class during
Phase 4 and a greater number of larger flakes from Phase 3 (Table 37). Also apparent is the high
percentage of small corticate (â¤ 0.25 inch) flakes from Phase 4, which suggests that early stage
reduction of quartzite small nodules or corticate large flakes occurred onsite,. The 0.25-inch size
category has similar numbers of flakes between the AUs, and a large difference between the
percentages of corticate flakes (32 percent vs. 51.3 percent). During Phase 3, this can be a
function of reducing cobbles or flake blanks from which more of the cortex was previously
removed. The larger corticate flakes from Phase 3 suggest that cobbles, possibly larger-sized
nodules, were being reduced.

In Phase 4, the overall cortex percentage is the same between chert and quartzite, but average
flake size is greater in the chert debitage, where 55.2 percent are size grade 0.5â1.0-inch, and in
the quartzite, 54 percent is in the 0.25â0.50-inch range (Table 38).

Chert Types
The chert lithic assemblage was further examined in an attempt to identify similar cherts, possible
known chert types, and general provenience of the chert using a variety of observations.
Chert descriptions combine color comparison, texture, and inclusions or lack thereof. In addition,
the presence/absence of cortex was noted. Cortex color was recorded as where cortex
characteristics, including surface texture and appearance and thickness. Cortex is a surrounding
rind or casing that may form around chert (Masson 1998). In primary deposits such as limestone
beds, chert may be nodular or tabular, and the interface between the chert and surrounding
limestone may develop into cortex.
The two main categories of cortex identified for this study are riverine and weathered (Table 36).
The thick, soft cortex thought to represent excavated or recently exposed nodular chert from
primary deposits was not observed. This cortex can be removed by natural effects of erosion,
either in streambeds or in an upland setting. If the amount of cortex was too small to make an
assessment, no determination was made. Smoothed, rounded, and sometimes slightly pitted
cortex was assumed to be from an alluvial or fluvial environment, with the cortex frequently
showing evidence of mineral staining from iron and manganese. Staining occurring along
internal fracture planes can resemble cortex, but tend to lack other traits such as pitting and wear
patterns created by other mechanisms. In some instances, the color of the cortex extended into
the chert.
Weathered cortex frequently had riverine traits as well as a porous to slightly chalky feel, and
pitting tends to be deeper. This situation represents cobbles that have been exposed to the
elements for longer or to more extreme periods. Mineral staining can also appear on the cortex
and into the underlying chert. These cortex rinds are a destructive process caused by a reaction of
the chert to the environment. Chert obtained from primary seams and from within large cobbles
may be free of cortex.
Following the assumption that the presence of cortex is informative as to raw material acquisition
and transport costs (e.g., Andrefsky 1998; Odell 2004; Parry and Kelly 1987), identifying the type
of cortex can provide information about the source and origin of the chert. Samples with riverine
cortex imply that gravel bars and streambeds were utilized. Weathered and upland cortex imply
longer-exposed chert sources such as in reworked alluvial deposits and lag deposits along valley
margins and uplands.

Ultraviolet Light Analysis
Large area surveys of Central Texas have tried to identify regional and local chert types. The
extensive studies at Fort Hood (Trierweiler 1994) identified over 17 types of chert. At WilsonLeonard in Williamson County, at least 152 types of chert were identified from a sample of
40,000 flakes (Masson 1998). Of these 152 types, more than 97 percent (n=147) of the types
were assumed to be Edwards chert. This demonstrates the vast array of chert diversity for
Edwards-typed chert. According to Masson (1998), the most consistent identifier of Edwards
chert has been ultraviolet (UV) light. An earlier sampling by TARL analysts of 257 chert
specimens from primary Edwards outcrops found that 92 percent fluoresced to shades of yellow
and orange (Frederick et al. 1994). Only high heat appears to affect UV results, whereas heat
166

treating has no effect (Odell 2004). The majority of tested Edwards chert fluoresces from yellow
to orange and corresponding to Munsell color sheets 2.5Y and 5Y (Frederick and Ringstaff 1994;
Frederick et al. 1994; Masson 1998).
All chert samples from 41DL203 were analyzed under both long and shortwave UV light using a
dual bulb Raytech LS-88CB lamp. A variety of known Edwards chert was examined to establish
a baseline of expected fluorescence. These samples included specimens from Kerr County and
from Georgetown in Williamson County, and samples of Georgetown chert were arrayed with
each analyzed sample. The sample locations are shown in Figure 60. Thirty specimens from
eight typed collections from CAR were compared to the 41DL203 chert assemblage. These
samples were from both raw material and artifacts. Table 39 lists the samples, proveniences, and
descriptions. Half (n=15) of the specimens come from predominantly Central and South Texas,
and 15 specimens are from Dove Isle Lake in Polk County, East Texas. This area had been
designated as being chert-resource poor. From the Polk County sample, two of the specimens
fluoresced orange. Based on the other specimens, orange fluorescence is more likely to occur in
samples from the Texas Hill Country, such as Kerr County and Kendall County. Whether the
orange fluoresced chert from 41DL203 is from these parts of Central Texas is unknown.
In addition to the comparative sample, the 119 chert artifacts were categorized into 27 color
groups according to descriptive visual and textural elements. Samples unlike any other specimen
were given a âGroup 0â designation. Group 5 was subsequently added to Group 1. Allowance
was also made for developing patinas. Color comparisons were made using standard Munsell
Soil color charts and Munsell Rock color chart. All chert material was individually examined for
the dominant color, secondary color, texture, and presence/description of inclusions. After the
assemblage was organized into chert color groups, the group divisions were compared with the
ultraviolet light. Of the 119 samples, 88 were classified to a group. The following are
descriptions of the 27 color groups:
1. N=7.

brown on both specimens.
The color groups were compared by AU and against the UV analysis. Table 40 shows the
distribution of the color groups by AU. Groupings found in different AUs may represent the
same material brought to the site at different periods, the same material found at different locales,
and/or the masking or failure of color groupings to identify and categorize the chert accurately.
As a check, the UV results were compared with the color groupings of the debitage. Table 41
compares the color groups against fluorescence and shows variation in fluorescence within some
groupings. Based upon previous UV analyses (e.g., Frederick et al. 1994; Masson 1998), these
variations likely reflect different chert proveniences, despite their similar appearances.
More significant trends are observed when UV fluorescence is examined by AU. As previously
stated, Edwards chert has a high percentage of fluorescence, greater than 90 percent, and tends to
fluoresce within certain color ranges, typically 2.5Yâ5Y on the Munsell color charts. A variety
of chert sources, from stream bedload cobbles to chert outcrops, have been sampled that all
display a similar range of color response. The source of Uvalde gravels is from outside the
Edwards Plateau, yet these gravels occur from upland divides in North Texas to streambeds in
South Texas. Certain Uvalde gravel chert will fluoresce similar to Edwards chert, suggesting a
common property is shared between the Uvalde chert source and the Edwards cherts. Of the
chert sample of 119âcombining debitage, projectile points, miscellaneous bifaces, and the single
unifaceâ91, or 76.4 percent, fluoresce, and this rate is not constant through time as measured by
the AUs.
The chert debitage in Table 42 shows the varying rates of fluorescence. All chert from Phase 1
and all but one piece from Phase 4 but 50 percent of Phase 2 and 0 percent of Phase 3 fluoresce.
The pattern continues when miscellaneous bifaces are compared (Table 43), where 100 percent of
Phase 1 fluoresces, and 50 percent of Phase 4. The single biface from Phase 4 does not fluoresce,
in comparison to 97 percent of the debitage from that AU that does. Projectile points are
similarly patternedâexcept there were no chert points from Phase 1 (Table 44). Although 80
percent of Phase 2 points fluoresce, 0 percent of the points from Phase 3 and 100 percent of the
points from Phase 4 fluoresce.

Summary of Analytical Units
After the initial sampling analysis that used three analytical units (Late Archaic, Transitional, and
Late Prehistoric), an examination of the chert assemblage divided the materials into four
analytical units (Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4). Since the initial sampling strategy involved a 75 percent
selection per analytical unit, the chert artifacts were examined as a separate assemblage and then
as part of the overall lithic assemblage. This included specimens from the deepest portions of the
site that were not included in the initial analysis.

Phase 1
Phase 1 contains few pieces of debitage. Although composed of approximately 15 m3 of fill, only
12 pieces of debitage were recovered, 25 percent of them chert. Three of the nine bifaces are
chert, the highest ratio of chert to quartzite. The chert bifaces are late stage or indeterminate. An
expedient scraper and six dart points are included in the AU, none of them chert. Phase 1 is
therefore significant in that it contains few chert or quartzite debitage specimens, but six dart
points, eight bifaces (three of chert), a single flake tool, and no cores.
The sparse artifact assemblage suggests repeated visitations to the site, during which a limited
number of activities were performed. The lack of debitage suggests that the primary or initial
manufacturing occurred elsewhere for both quartzite and chert tools. All of the chert fluoresced
in colors similar to the expected signature for Edwards cherts.

175

Phase 2
The bulk of the assemblage from Phase 2 is a tool assemblage dominated by Gary points. Both
chert and quartzite were used for tools, and it is likely that chert and quartzite tools were made at
the site. Feature 6 contained the remains of at least 20 quartzite cobbles and may represent
intensified site use and tool production. The majority of the flake tools (8 of 13), including the
one made from chert, a bifacial tool, and 68 bifaces, of which 57 are manufacturing failures, and
14 of the 22 cores are from the late Late Archaic. Next to bifaces, Gary points form the largest
single tool category. The composition of the lithic assemblage is the expected signature for
increasingly diverse site use, especially compared to the previous Phase 1 and the following
Phase 3. In his analysis of the Hell Gap site, Knell (2004) used a coarse-scale aggregate analysis
method for the lithic assemblage using MANA. He proposes two types of nodules: (1)
production nodules, locally procured and used to make tools onsite; and (2) transport nodules,
semiprepared or prepared blanks and cores that are imported onsite. Feature 6 within the Phase 2
AU fits his definition of production nodulesâreduction of nodules onsite for o-site tool
production. The fluorescence rate for bifaces and chert debitage is 50 percent, and for projectile
points is 80 percent. This suggests the use of a variety of chert sources, as noted in the chert color
groupings.

Phase 3
This analytical unit contains two Scallorn points as well as six dart points. Previously, this unit
was termed the Transitional Analytical unit; however, based upon the presence of the arrow
points and a radiocarbon date of 1290Â±40 BP, the unit was changed to Phase 3. There are only ten
pieces of chert debitage, but two chert projectile points, a chert biface, and 18 miscellaneous
bifaces. The quartzite debitage suggests tool manufacturing favored partially reduced nodules or
flakes and that occasionally larger initial flakes were removed. None of the chert items
fluoresced, suggesting changing chert sources.

Phase 4
Phase 4 Analytical Unit contains more chert than Phase 1 AU. When cortex remaining on the
chert is examined, 16 of the 17 specimens have a riverine cortex. Previously in the Phase 2 AU,
cortex was divided between weathered, riverine, and indeterminate. The almost exclusive
presence of riverine cobble suggests acquisition or sources different from the other analytical
units. The percentage of corticate flakes suggests chert nodules or early stage bifaces or flake
blanks are being reduced at the site and could indicate a local source for the chert. Almost all of
the chert fluoresced, including the four typed arrow points, in contrast to the Phase 3 AU.
The chert and quartzite, although different raw materials, are used in similar fashion when both
materials are more common, as during Phase 2 and Phase 4.

CHAPTER 10
SYNTHESIS
by Clayton M. Tinsley

INTRODUCTION
Overall, the mitigation excavations at 41DL203 produced a rich data set. Analysis of the
recovered materials is discussed in the context of several fundamental issues (paleoenvironmental
reconstruction, subsistence, chronology, and settlement systems) highlighted in regional research
frameworks (Fields and Tomka 1993; Perttula et al. 1993). The Late ArchaicâLate Prehistoric
site 41DL203 shares broad similarities with many of the previously discussed creek-side sites in
the region. However, having data from only a single isolated site hinders an ability to address the
interregional dynamics of issues such as settlement systems/mobility, paleoenvironment, and
regional subsistence. Lacking multisite data, an alternative theoretical approach is offered that
allows for a detailed examination of single sites without requiring the a priori assumptions
associated with most neo-functional hunter/gatherer theories. Even in the absence of intersite
data from the current project, 41DL203 provides valuable data concerning prehistoric life ways in
Northcentral Texas.

PALEOENVIRONMENT
Since at least the middle of the twentieth century, archaeologists have been calling for the
collection of environmental data along with cultural material. Although Walter Taylor (1948)
was one of the first to explicitly call for the collection of environmental data as part of
excavations, environmental archaeology, as known today, was well established within the
functional paradigm of the New Archaeology by the late 1960s.
To date, research of past environmental conditions within the plains region of the United States
has been uneven, with the Southern Plains being the least well understood (Hall and Lintz 1984;
Patton 1977). More specifically, Northcentral Texas, being within the margins of the Southern
Plains and Eastern Woodlands, has yet to benefit from a modern interdisciplinary investigation of
paleoenvironmental conditions.

177

The earliest context at 41DL203 is well dated to approximately 3,300 BP, which places it at the
Hypsithermal/Neoglacial boundary. It is postulated the dry Hypsithermal or âPrairie Maximumâ
persisted longer in the extreme Southern Plains than in areas farther north, ending at
approximately 4,500â3,200 BP (Patton 1977; Wood 1998). Within the Southern Plains, cool and
moist conditions of the neoglacial are believed to have extended until approximately 1,500 BP,
when more xeric conditions again dominated (Bryant and Holloway 1985:62â63). The
environmental information gained from 41DL203 (primarily from geoarchaeology and
archaeobotany) is coarse-grained but rather informative.
Based on charcoal samples collected throughout the profile of the excavation, certain trends are
suggested (see Chapter 6). For the earliest phase (Phase 1) at between 200â190 cmbs, only wild
nutsedge tuber remains are present. Wild nutsedge favors moist and open areas, suggesting an
environment consistent with cool and moist neoglacial conditions. Farther up the profile (Phase
2), various unidentifiable angiosperm (hardwood) species are present early in the phase, and by
the end of Phase 2, identifications include hickory, elm, pecan and hackberryâsuggesting a
bottomland forest setting. By Phase 3, a wetter pattern is suggested by the presence of
cottonwood. A stark change in moisture is hypothesized for Phase 4 as a shift to a dominance of
drier adapted forest species (e.g., bur oak and chinquapin oak) is detected within the charcoal
samples.
This pattern of open and moist conditions followed by a progression of angiosperm species and
forest development is echoed in the geoarchaeological record (see Chapter 7). Stable isotopic
measurers from soil profiles in Phase 1 through Phase 3 show a general progression of organic
carbon from C3 plants. Like the botanical data, isotopic data detail a prominent shift toward C4
carbon and drier conditions in the final Phase 4 site occupation. This onset of C4 carbon is
associated with the ârecent alluviationâ or âWest Fork paleosolâ noted by various researchers
(e.g., Humphrey and Ferring 2001) within the upper Trinity River drainage.
The faunal assemblage from 41DL203 only provides for a general proxy measure of the
environment through the entire duration of the site, rather than a finer-grained detail by phase.
The vertebrate fauna was rather uniform in its diversity through the phases, and small changes in
the number and variety of species could simply have been a factor of sample size and were not
used in a phase-by-phase interpretation of past environment. Similarly, the small sample size of
molluscan fauna from each phase also precluded a detailed phase-by-phase reconstruction of
environment. However, collectively, the faunal assemblage from 41DL203 reveals riparian taxa
consistent with a perennial, slow-moving, mid-order stream (see Chapter 8).
In sum, the proxy environmental evidence from 41DL203 reveals patterns consistent with what is
known of the region in general. Phase 1 of the site, dated to approximately 3,390â3,230 BP,
appears to have been occupied during the early stages of the cooler, moister neoglacial period.
The stream setting of the site was possibly more open during Phase 1 as suggested by the
presence of wild nutsedge. Tree cover increases through the following Phases 2 and 3, but
conditions moderate, and by Phase 4 (640â590 BP), dry conditions dominate and grass
communities expand at the expense of tree cover. This xeric expansion of prairie at
approximately 500â600 BP is much later than evidence from other documented sites in the
Southern Plains and Northcentral Texas, which commonly have the shift occurring at
approximately 1,500 BP (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Humphrey and Ferring 2001; Quigg et al.
2008).

178

CHRONOLOGY
The subject of site chronology within Northcentral Texas, like all of Texas, has historically been
wedded to a culture-historical paradigm. The legacy of McKernâs (1939) Midwestern Taxonomic
method and its modifications are still shaping the way archaeological materials are grouped and
discussed within the region and state. This paradigm is embedded within North Americaâs
version of Christian Thomsenâs five-stage developmental framework for European prehistory,
developed in the early nineteenth century (Thomsen 1836). Thomsenâs five stages (Paleolithic,
Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron) provided a developmental/social evolutionary framework
for archaeological material that is still widely used in Europe. North Americaâs version consists
of regional variants of the following developmental framework: Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and
Woodland-Late Prehistoric. The material from 41DL203 spans the Late Archaic through Late
Prehistoric periods.

Late Archaic
Within Northcentral Texas, the Archaic has been dated to ca. 8,500â1,300 BP (Prikryl 1993:199).
The Archaic is subdivided into three components: Early (8,500 to 6,000 BP), Middle (6,000 to
3,500 BP), and Late (3,500 to 1,300 BP). The Late Archaic is the most represented component
within the region, and its increased representation has been credited to increases in local
populations (cf. Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1993). Phases 1 and 2 within 41DL203 are
dated to the Late Archaic, and these components have many similarities with the few thoroughly
researched Late Archaic sites within the region. Late Archaic components at Joe Pool Lake
(Peter and McGregor 1988) and Richland-Chambers Reservoir (McGregor and Bruseth 1987)
collectively reflected large amounts of fire-cracked rock within small ephemeral sites in
bottomland/floodplain locations. Site 41DL203, shares these characteristics as well as revealing
diagnostic dart points consistent with the Late Archaic in the region (see Chapter 9).
Unlike Richland-Chambers, 41DL203 did not contain ceramics dated to the Late Archaic period,
as its only ceramics were recovered in Phase 4 (Late Prehistoric). Likewise, no other regionally
distinctive (Late Archaic) cultural manifestations such as âWylie pitsâ were in evidence at
41DL203. In general, 41DL203âs Phase 1 and Phase 2 were securely dated to the Late Archaic
and did not reveal any diagnostics temporally associated with other periods, but did add further
data regarding possible resource adaptations due to the well-preserved faunal collection.

Late Prehistoric
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric has been traditionally tied to the advent of the bow and
arrow and pottery (e.g., Perttula 2004). For Northcentral Texas, the Late Prehistoric period
occurs from 1,300 BP to 400 BP. However, this social evolutionary framework encounters
problems within Northcentral Texas, as pottery has been recorded regionally as early as ca. 1,800
BP (Bruseth and Martin 1987). Further complicating matters, âWylie pitâ features traditionally
associated with (and dated to) the Late Prehistoric have had basal layers dated as early as ca.
2,000 BP, thus raising questions about Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric material culture continuities
(Bruseth and Martin 1987). Researchers within the region have also subdivided the Late
Prehistoric differently, with some opting for a bipartite division (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990), and
others have further subdivided using a tripartite system (Bruseth and Martin 1987; Peter and
McGregor 1988).
179

The material from Phase 3 and Phase 4 within 41DL203 neatly subdivide into two temporal
groups based on chronology and stone tool types. Phase 3 (1,290â1,160 BP) contained Scallorn
points, and Bonham and Fresno points (as well as mussel-shell tempered ceramics) were
recovered from Phase 4 (640â590 BP). Faunal data from the site revealed more similarities
between Phase 2 and Phase 3 (Late ArchaicâLate Prehistoric) than between the two Late
Prehistoric phases (Phases 3 and 4). Although prey species were broadly similar among all
phases of the site, Phases 2 and 3 specimens revealed similarities in the lack of marrow extraction
pattern that could be indicative of either lack of dietary stress or cultural patterning (see Chapter
8).
Stone tool, ceramic material, and AMS dating from the Late Prehistoric phases of the site provide
for a rather clear subdivision into earlier (Scallorn points) and later (Fresno, Bonham points and
shell-tempered ceramics) temporal categories. This simple bipartite subdivision favors Prikrylâs
(1990, 1993) Late Prehistoric I and Late Prehistoric II division of the period. Although little
diagnostic cultural material other than Scallorn points was recovered from the early phase of the
Late Prehistoric, the later phase revealed diagnostic points as well as shell-tempered ceramics.
The combination of Fresno, Maud, Harrell, Washita, and Perdiz points with shell-tempered
pottery has been associated with bison hunting and Southern Plains influences (Drass 1998, 2008;
Prikryl 1990). This Southern Plains assemblage is believed to have been associated with
semisedentary agriculturists that were involved in bison hunting. The Southern Plains
hunter/villager adaptation has been labeled the Henrietta complex (Drass 1998; Krieger 1946).
The linking of bison hunting, shell-tempered ceramics, and agriculture within Northcentral Texas
has been limited. Most importantly, the evidence for agriculture within Late Prehistoric
Northcentral Texas has been minimal to date. Additionally, it has been noted that the Plains
adaptations to the northwest were truly distinctive in many ways when compared to the local
Northcentral Texas adaptations seen throughout the Late Prehistoric (Peter et al. 1997).
Currently, the Henrietta complex provides little service as a construct within Northcentral Texas
Late Prehistoric trajectories.

SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
Data concerning settlement patterning and exchange are fragmentary and, as with much of what
is known of the regionâs prehistory, come primarily from reservoir projects undertaken several
decades ago (e.g., McGregor and Bruseth 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988). Multisite,
synchronic and diachronic examinations of settlement patterns within Northcentral Texas are rare,
and as such, our understanding of these dynamics is based on a sample that quite likely does not
truly represent the full range of settlement dynamics.

Late Archaic
Based on the increased use of lower quality quartzites, a reduction in mobility within prehistoric
groups of Northcentral Texas beginning in the Late Archaic is implied. This intensification of
lower quality (and more local) lithic materials was believed to be indicative of a more localized
adaption than had been in evidence during the previous Middle Archaic period (Crook and Harris
1952; Peter and McGregor 1988). An increase in the number of Late Archaic site components
over previous periods, along with the evidence for less mobility, has been interpreted as
indicating a sharp increase in local populations.
180

Peter and McGregor (1988) and McGregor and Bruseth (1987) provide evidence of increases in
Late Archaic populations within Northcentral Texas. Additionally, these multisite reservoir
projects also provided information concerning the placement and function of sites dating to this
period. Peter and McGregor (1988) detail both large bottomland habitation sites (e.g., 41DL199)
as well as creek-side hunting camps (e.g., 41DL189). According to these authors, the limited
seasonal information from these bottomland sites suggested possible spring and summer
occupations. Deer, mussel, turtle, and fish were cited as the seasonal prey (Peter and McGregor
1988:363). This summer exploitation of the Mountain Creek drainage was postulated to be part
of a much larger seasonal scheduling round, with more permanent sites likely located along the
main channel of the Trinity River.
Lithic data from 41DL203 (see Chapter 9) regarding the level of manufacture as well as the
source of tool material provide some insight concerning possible migration patterns within the
region. Evidence from the earliest Late Archaic phase (Phase 1) reveals no cortical material, and
a full 100 percent of the debitage fluoresced. The relative absence of cortical material suggests
that most of the lithic material making its way to the site was close to a finished state of use.
Additionally, the complete fluorescence of the debitage sample increases the probability that a
significant proportion of the material came from sources within Central Texas. This information
for the early portion of the Late Archaic suggests that the majority of lithic material was likely
brought to the site in near-finished form from sources that originated in Central Texas. While
source material suggests contacts to the south and west, dart typologies such as Gary, indicate
more easterly influences.
Evidence for the increased use of local material and a possible decrease in interregional migration
is not seen until the later phase of the Late Archaic (Phase 2). By Phase 2, the percentage of
cortical material increases significantly, and the percentage of debitage that fluoresces decreases
to approximately 50 percent. The possible increases of local material use continue into the
beginning of the Late Prehistoric, where fluorescing debitage is completely absent.

Late Prehistoric
Northcentral Texas prehistoric settlement patterns appear to remain fairly constant through the
end of the Late Archaic and into the Late Prehistoric. By the middle of the Late Prehistoric
period (ca. 1,000 BP) large habitation sites with evidence of maize agriculture (e.g., 41DL148) are
recorded (Peter and McGregor 1988). Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) was situated on a high alluvial
terrace (with sandy loam soil) at distance from the floodplain and contained house structures and
evidence of maize. Cobb-Pool was also associated with early Caddoan-type ceramics that led
some researches to suggest the site was evidence of intrusive groups into the region (Lynott 1981;
Skinner and Connors 1979; Watt 1953). Peter and McGregor (1988) provide an alternative
hypothesis, suggesting Cobb-Pool could be the result of a specific adaptation to the regional
environment, albeit with outside influences. This view was further bolstered by later
petrographic work showing most of the Caddoan-like wares were indeed local copies (Ferring
and Perttula 1987).
For the later part of the Late Prehistoric (650â350 BP), there is general agreement that artifactual
and subsistence data begin to reflect a Southern Plains bison-hunting orientation (Drass 1998,
2008; Lynott 1981; Prikryl 1990, 1993). A greater reliance upon bison hunting, shell-tempered
ceramics bearing similarities to Nocona Plain, and steeply chipped end scrapers are all cited as
181

evidence of Southern Plains influences. This apparent shift in subsistence has been attributed to
regional climatic changes resulting in dryer conditions conducive to prairie expansion (Dillehay
1974; Lynott 1981). McGregor and Bruseth (1987) argue for a significant reduction in
population for the later part of the Late Prehistoric based on fewer site components dating to this
period throughout their project area. Whether this reduction in site components was due to an
overall reduction in population or represents a shift to utilizing site locations with differing
resources beyond the project area is not clear. Conversely, Ferring and Yates (1998) argue for
increased populations during the latter half of the Late Prehistoric in the Lewisville Lake area to
the north.
According to the lithic data from 41DL203, approximately 97 percent of Phase 4 debitage
fluoresces, suggesting a strong component of imported Central Texas material. However, unlike
the Phase 1 debitage that also had a significant percentage of fluorescence, Phase 4 debitage
contained significantly more cortical material. These findings suggest that significant amounts of
nonlocal chert were imported into the region partially processed. Whether this chert was obtained
through trade, interregional migration, or some combination of both, is uncertain. Phase 4 also
contains the only recovered ceramicsâtwo sherds of plain shell-tempered pottery.
Data from 41DL203 provide evidence for creek-side (bottomland) site utilization from the
beginning of the Late Archaic though the end of the Late Prehistoric. Based on the faunal data
from the site, 41DL203 served primarily as a springâsummer seasonal hunting station for deer
and bison as well as a range of secondary species. Sites such as 41DL203 were likely part of a
regional settlement pattern that made use of small, temporary site-specific localities as well as
more permanent habitation sites located outside the floodplain.

SUBSISTENCE
Subsistence data have been systematically gathered from archaeological sites in Northcentral
Texas sites for more than 20 years. Although some diachronic trends have been postulated for
the region (e.g., bison population increase in the Late Prehistoric), little systematic work has been
carried out in the region addressing subsistence practices. Over the past few decades, select data
sets from discrete and varied locations across the region have been used to discuss possible
subsistence strategies through time. Not surprisingly, these disparate data sets from numerous
environmental settings within the region have revealed a range of data suggesting subsistence
variation through time and space.

Late Archaic
For the Late Archaic, a general pattern of mixed hunting focused on a combination of deer and
bison (with the inclusion of many smaller species such as rabbit and turtle) is evident at many
locations. From Lake Lewisville to the Richland Creek and Mountain Creek drainages, Late
Archaic contexts have revealed a mixed hunting strategy based primarily on large game (Ferring
and Yates 1998; McGregor and Bruseth 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988). Botanical evidence
from the Late Archaic in Northcentral Texas is not as robust but does show the presence of
Psoralea sp. and onion bulbs, hardwood nuts (e.g., hickory, pecan, and acorn), and seeds (e.g.,
sump weed and vetch). An increase in earth-oven roasting is discussed for Richland Creek sites,
and this cooking method is believed to be related to the use of the Psoralea sp. bulbs (McGregor
182

and Bruseth 1987). Seasonality of resource usage is inferred from the fall harvest of hardwood
nuts and faunal data that suggested a springâsummer kill pattern of deer (McGregor and Bruseth
1987; Peter and McGregor 1988). Psoralea sp. bulb is also among probable summer resources
for the region.
A mixed but steady concentration of large- and small-animal predation is present throughout the
Late Archaic phases of 41DL203. Deer is always the dominant large mammal, followed by
bison. Like other sites in the region, the remainder of the Late Archaic faunal mix includes small
mammals, turtle, mollusca, and small amounts of fish. Nutsedge, recovered in Phase 1, was the
only identified plant for the Late Archaic contexts, suggesting subsistence. Although charcoal
recovered from the Late Archaic contexts includes hardwood species, evidence of nutshell was
lacking. Seasonality information for the Late Archaic contexts is inferred from nutsedge and
neonatal deer remains, both consistent with a late springâsummer occupation.

Late Prehistoric
The transition to the early Late Prehistoric appears to be a continuation of the same basic
subsistence patterns noted for the Late Archaic. McGregor and Bruseth (1987) note a similar mix
in the flora and fauna for the early Late Prehistoric with an increase in the Psoralea sp. bulb
remains. Maize appears by AD 1000 in the Mountain Creek drainage at the Cobb-Pool
(41DL148) site and represents over 71 percent of the recovered botanical remains, with Psoralea
sp., nutshell, maygrass, and vetch also being present (Peter and McGregor 1988). To date, maize
has not been detected in any other Northcentral Texas early Late Prehistoric context.
By the later portion of the Late Prehistoric (AD 1300â1600), several changes are noted in regional
subsistence patterns. Maize appears in Richland Creek contexts at the same time fish and turtle
species decrease in abundance (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). McGregor and Bruseth (1987)
report that bison remains do not significantly increase during this period, but Ferring and Yates
(1998) and Peter and McGregor (1988) argue for their increased presence during the later part of
the Late Prehistoric. Although attributed to a shift in bison procurement and Plains influences,
the presence of shell-tempered pottery is noted for both areas where bison evidence increases as
well as for areas where it appears to remain the same.
The Late Archaic subsistence patterns noted for 41DL203 largely remain the same throughout the
Late Prehistoric. Large-animal hunting with a heavy reliance upon deer (and a small percentage
of bison) remains the basic faunal pattern from the Late Archaic through the Late Prehistoric.
Botanical data directly reflecting subsistence during the Late Prehistoric was not recovered from
the bulk flotation samples collected at the site and, as such, makes regional comparisons difficult.
Other post-AD 1300 Late Prehistoric shifts seen in other regional sites, such as an increase in
bison hunting or a reduction in fish and turtle, were not evident at 41DL203. Regarding
subsistence practices, 41DL203 appears to be a study in continuity. In spite of evidence for
climatic variations that have occurred in the region over the approximate 2,500 years for which
data exist, subsistence patterns were very similar through time. Considering the cultural changes
that must have occurred over this period of time, the level of subsistence continuity is even more
noteworthy.

183

THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The Late ArchaicâLate Prehistoric site 41DL203 shares broad similarities with many of the
regional creek-side sites discussed above. However, these similarities in subsistence and site
usage are largely a product of their physical location within the context of a synchronic settlement
system that likely made use of specialized extraction camps such as 41DL203 (and larger
habitation sites) over a given area. Evidence from 41DL203 suggests springâsummer hunting
activities, although its use as a fall hunting/nut gathering camp cannot be discounted. It is
unlikely a nut-rich hardwood stand like the one documented for the site duration would have been
ignored, especially for a location well known and visited at other times of the year. However,
limits in the data set do not allow for a full understanding of any multiseasonal use of the site.
Having new data from only a single isolated site hinders any ability to address dynamic issues
such as settlement systems/mobility, paleoenvironment, and regional subsistence. Multisite
survey and excavation projects that include both valley floor and assorted terrace locations
through an entire drainage system would be necessary to fully explore these research concerns.
Given the nature of cultural resource management, this eventuality seems unlikely because
random single or multiple disparate sites are often the subject of resource management projects.
However, because of the constraints of the data coming from a single site, making the most of
research opportunities becomes a necessity as well as a challenge.
One primary challenge is extrapolating data from one site to test hypotheses generated from neofunctionalist hunter/gather theories that rely upon the examination of multiple environmental and
landscape resource variables through time and space (cf. Bettinger 1991; Binford 1980; DysonHudson and Smith 1978). These still popular perspectives give primary agency to the natural
environment and postulate that cultures âmust first and foremost adapt themselves to the
resources and opportunities of their particular environmentsâ (Adams 1998:66). An overreliance
upon the natural environment as the independent variable in assessing cultural behaviors
significantly limits research potential when data are limited to one environmental âpointâ in
space.
Alternatively, historical ecology focuses on how cultural groups, instead of adapting their
subsistence activities, seasonal schedules, population size, and settlements onto preexisting
constraints in the environment, transform most of those constraints for human utilization and
modification (Balee 2006; Heckenberger et al. 1999; Heckenberger et al. 2003; Stahl 1996, 2002,
2006). Historical ecology does not make use of the âecosystemâ concept (cf. Moran 1990, 2000;
Rappaport 2000) because of its historic association with synchronic views of arbitrarily defined
spatial units in supposed states of equilibrium (Balee 2006). Instead, it postulates that intentional
and unintentional human activities can create (in addition to environmental degradation)
sustained levels of environmental disturbance considered important for ensuring resilience of
biotas and landscapes (Connell 1978; Scoones 1999; Stahl 1996, 2002; Zimmer 1994; Zimmer
and Young 1998). Any human-inhabited environment has a unique and often complex human
history imbedded within it. Understanding the human-induced role in the creation and
modification of this uniqueness is the goal of historical ecology:
This approach involves the study of human effects on other life-forms wherever they exist; historic
changes in cultures due to these effects; and continuing (i.e., ethnographically documented) human
effects on nature, sometimes in ways that increase complexity and heterogeneity of the landscape
through phenomena such as enhanced soils (Hecht 2003, Hecht and Posey 1989; McCann, Woods and
Meyer 2001), hydrology (Erickson 2006; Raffles 2002) and species composition (Balee 1998; Stahl
2006, Balee and Erickson 2006) [Balee 2006:6].
184

Historical ecology is an approach that is appropriate for studying past human-environmental
interactions at a range of temporal and spatial scales. To date, both detailed single site analyses
as well as regional studies have been undertaken using the theoretical approach (see Crumley
1994 for review).
Although the current site adds to the corpus of knowledge regarding small hunting sites within
Northcentral Texas, it alone ultimately adds little to our understanding of intraregional and
interregional dynamics within such areas as settlement systems/mobility, paleoenvironment, and
chronology. However, the site is an interesting example of human resilience due to the recursive
interplay of the environment and its cultural modifications.
Clearly, 41DL203 was part of a larger settlement patternâa pattern that likely changed through
time. Evidence from the site is consistent with a seasonal hunting camp. In spite of apparent
changes in the climate and regional environment through the site history, it functioned as a
specialized hunting camp throughout the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods with a
consistent faunal signature. The siteâs resilience as a productive, broad-based hunting camp (in
spite of the above-mentioned cultural-environmental changes) is both remarkable and likely not
an accident of circumstance. Numerous research programs have helped discredit the often-held
belief in âthe pristine mythâ of natureâthe idea that New World environments were not primarily
anthropogenic before European contact (cf. Denevan 1992). A growing corpus of literature has
focused on prehistoric anthropogenic effects throughout the Americas (Balee 1992, 1994, 2006;
Butzer 1992; Denevan 1992; McDade 1993; Stahl 2006; Yoon 1993).
The gradual transformation of site 41DL203 from a neo-glacial open area to angiosperm
(hardwood) stand over time was very likely nurtured by human action. Evidence suggests the
establishment of a hardwood stand in the Late Archaic that through time evolved into a more
open canopy (i.e., more biotically productive). Either by clearing undergrowth as part of seasonal
camping in the area or by more purposeful understory removal, conditions conducive to mature
hardwood growth were fostered. A mature hardwood stand within a riparian context such as
41DL203 would have been a valuable resource for both human and fauna living in a prairie
environment. A mature hardwood stand with an open canopy would have been a major draw for
white-tailed deer, and the fact that deer percentages remain constant through all phases (even into
the xeric conditions of the later portion of the Late Prehistoric) is a testament to the productivity
of a managed landscape resource.

FINAL DISCUSSION
The testing and subsequent mitigation of 41DL203 adjacent to Rowlett Creek in Dallas County
provided significant site-specific data regarding animal procurement, seasonality, and human
use/modification of the local environment. Data spanning the Late Archaic through Late
Prehistoric periods are placed within a regional context and share similarities (e.g., subsistence
and chronology) with other creek-side sites investigated within Northcentral Texas. However,
differences were also noted. Drier conditions associated with the Late Prehistoric were recorded
at the site approximately 1,000 years later than at other regional sites. Additionally, the bisonhunting cultural complex (associated with the Late Prehistoric in the region) was not evident in
the 41DL203 assemblage.

185

The data from 41DL203 are consistence with a small, seasonal hunting site used primarily in the
spring and summer months. Although the site offers new data for the region concerning
paleoenvironment, subsistence, chronology, and settlement patterns, it highlights some of the
research limitations of single-site investigations, especially when using typical hunter/gatherer
theories. Due to these theoretical limitations and the recent call for new perspectives within
Texas archaeology (Barrett 2009), historical ecology is introduced as a paradigm that can offer
additional insight into single-site (and multisite) examinations.
Regardless of theoretical perspective, the âtraditionalâ research domains listed above (i.e.,
paleoenvironment, subsistence, chronology, and settlement patterning) cannot be properly
addressed using randomly selected single-site examinations common to cultural resources
management. To address such issues thoroughly within the Rowlett Creek drainage, multiple
sitesâboth with the flood valley as well as on upper terrace locationsâwould have to be
excavated using coordinated recovery techniques. Given the likelihood of such investigations in
the future, calls for new approaches to site analysis and regional synthesis (Barrett 2009) are all
the more prescient.
