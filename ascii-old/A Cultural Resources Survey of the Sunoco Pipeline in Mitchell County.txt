Abstract
Flatrock Enginering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources linear survey of the
proposed 1.6-mile x 80-foot Sunoco Pipeline right-of-way in northeastern Mitchell and
southeastern Scurry County, Texas.
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a thorough pedestrian survey of the right-of-way, and
excavated seven shovel tests on September 24, 2014, resulting in the discovery of one historic
trash scatter (41MH100). Tierras Antiguas assessed the site as heavily disturbed and nonsignificant. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommended that construction of the Sunoco Pipeline
should be allowed to proceed as currently designed. The project should be considered as having
“no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the
project should be allowed to proceed without further archaeological work.
However, Tierras Antiguas further advised that if any additional cultural resources were
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or any other qualified professional
archaeologists.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly three individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. Wade Ingle,
Senior Partner at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd., and Ms. Judy Vader, and Mr.
Brannon Norton, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. All were
extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their overall knowledge of the project
contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope of work.
Another individual who was extremely helpful in the completion of this report is Joel Butler who
masterfully created the map overlays presented. In addition, I very much relied upon Crew Chief
Belisario Silva, and archaeological Field Technicians Alex McBride and Devin Sorrows with
Tierras Antiguas. They are dedicated individuals, and as always, these three “hosses” worked
meticulously to ensure all aspects of this investigation were thoroughly documented in accordance
with Texas Historical Commission and Council of Texas Archeologists standards.

Based upon TAAI’s recommendations, Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. and Access
Midstream agreed that an archaeological survey of the pipeline right-of-way should be conducted
before the pipeline was installed.

Project Setting
Soils and Hydrology
As shown in Figure 4, there are seven different soil types within the Project Area that offer varying
depths, resulting primarily from alluvial processes related to the overbank flooding and subsequent
downcutting of Little Sulphur Creek. As such, these various soil classifications otherwise imply
the potential for the preservation of intact cultural resources to exist (Dixon et al. 1973; Stoner
et al. 1969; Websoil Survey 2014). Typical soil pedons of these seven classifications are
synthesized below.

The Colorado River drains both Mitchell and Scurry County from the northwest to the southeast,
fed by first-order tributaries Big Silver Creek, Willow Creek, Beals Creek, Wildhorse Creek,
Champion Creek, Lone Wolf Creek, Hasting Creek, and Little Sulphur Creek. In Scurry County,
the Clear Fork of the Brazos River cuts through the southwestern portion of the county. The
Colorado River meanders significantly in the southern portion of Mitchell County, as it has cut
through the Callahan Divide, a line of east-west trending hills (Amin and Leffler 1996; Leffler
1996).
Flora, Fauna, and Climate
The Project Area lies within the North Central Plains physiographic region of Texas (Figure 5).
within the Great Plains region. More specifically, Scurry County is situated at the base of the Llano
Estacado and the Caprock escarpment. The High Plains are highest in their southern most portion,
on the Llano Estacado plateau, with elevations reaching over 3,200 ft above mean sea level (amsl).
Running from the northern portion of the Texas Panhandle southward into Central Texas, the
Caprock escarpment forms an abrupt boundary between the flat Llano Estacado and the deeply
incised and rapidly eroding Caprock Canyonlands along its eastern edge. The Caprock
Canyonlands become less rugged and incised as the southeasterly flowing rivers broaden their
valleys, and enter the Lower Plains region, encompassing generally rolling, low hills and ridges
(Boyd 1995; Parsons 1967; Carroll 1996). The topography of both Mitchell and Scurry counties
is typified by an undulating nearly level to rolling landscape with predominately rangelands on
loamy and dry soils. Elevation in Mitchell county ranges from 2,004 feet to 2,616 feet above mean
sea level from the northwest to the southwest, while elevation in Scurry County ranges from 2,000
to 2,700 feet (Amin and Leffler 1996; Leffler 1996).
The modern climate of the Project Area is classified as semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall
of less than 20 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year, with average
daily maximum temperatures averaging about 960F in July, to around 260F degrees in January. The
combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in frequent droughts as well as
sporadic periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of roughly 214-217 days
(Amin and Leffler 1996; Leffler 1996).

Cultural Chronology
The Project Area presumes cultural affinities both indigenous to the western edge of the
north-central Texas region as well as intrusive influences from the Southern Great Plains (Figure
6). Several scholars have offered sound but differing arguments for cultural chronologies for the
Southern Great Plains extending into northern Texas. The cultural chronology, defined by complex
(in lieu of the terms phase, interval, or period) of the North American High Plains has been
synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and more recently, the Southern High Plains in Texas by
Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd (1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains
complexes are defined by shifts in climatic conditions and subsistence more so than changes in
point style, which are indicators of change in central and south Texas. The following discussions
are primarily derived from Johnson and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al.
(1989). All dates are approximate and given as years before present (B.P.).

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited the landscape before 11,500 B.P, solid evidence does not
support their existence. Although human behavior is inferred on stone artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site (Fox et al. 1992:51-73), all are problematic. At Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of north-central Texas, radiocarbon dates initially believed to be from burned
charcoal in human campfires, and approximating an antiquity of 40,000 years were later disproved
as dates on natural coal (Stanford 1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic proof
of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on stable
landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell County,
Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and with artifacts
stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances of providing
conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292-294; Collins
and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains were
occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980)
suggests an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts
include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points
across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the
people who made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have
documented the presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436; 2004). A Folsom interval follows the
Clovis, except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with
dart points called "Goshen" may be present (Hofman et al. 1989:34; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
A well-documented Paleoindian Clovis site in the southern Great Plains is the McLean site in
Taylor County, west of Abilene (Ray and Bryan 1938; Sellards 1952). Folsom sites in the area
include the Scharbauer site in northwestern Midland County (Wendorf et al. 1955), and the
Adair-Steadman site in north central Nolan County (Tunnel 1977). A fourth site nearby containing
9

a Milnesand component is Lone Wolf Creek in northeastern Mitchell County (Wormington 1957).
By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in
Bell County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison (Bison
antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940), archaeological
evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either extinct or
otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope,
and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required technological
shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman et
al. 1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano
Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of
megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic
hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game
hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas,
such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et al. 2011).
Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were small and highly mobile, an inference from
the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed and that diagnostic types are seen across a
wide area, including most of Texas and northern Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline
in the number of bison on the plains forced the inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants
and animals which would produce the same amount of calories and protein with the same or
slightly more effort expended. Using projectile points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues
that the area was used more frequently in the Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic,
probably due to "decline of bison and other game animals on the Southern Plains." Story (1985),
however, believes that population densities were low during this period, and that groups consisted
of related individuals in small bands with "few constraints on their mobility" (Story 1985:39). Their
economy was based on diffuse utilization of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round
resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
10

of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285).
Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains
decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation
of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut
harvests in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black
1989a). Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the
acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and
processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens are
a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt this
conclusion (e.g., Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock middens
are still a matter of controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach and
Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus
seems to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other
plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds
of accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called "burned rock middens" in the archaeological
community, but are sometimes referred to as "Indian mounds" by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about 4500
B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites, at least
in the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (et al. 1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as
the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or
fell during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of
11

burned rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the
Blue Hole site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32
(Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens
at Camp Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County
(Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in
diameter were still very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have
become less specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base
(Black 1989b:30). Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains
area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the
Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440; 2004). At
Loma Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story
(1985:44-45) believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981),
Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968a, b), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt (1980)
further posits that population in the Taylor County area peaked during the Late Archaic with
groups moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found in the
region were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still "pre-ceramic" until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45-47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points.
The most common are Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2011), both of which are short,
triangular points with side notches. The Frio point also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt
(1980) presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's
(1974) contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes, which
also lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.
Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term "Plains Woodland or Woodland" is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits marks the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including
the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and
the northern South Texas Plain (Black 1989b:32; Story 1985:45-47). Two complexes following
the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from about
2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts into
rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
12

Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977; Skinner
1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a "bison corridor" into the
South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to Hurt
(1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is mirrored
in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due to the
increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the "Protohistoric". On the Southern High Plains, Hofman et al.
(1989:91) agree that "The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were
limited European contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history."
The cultural context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the
presence of outside ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of
Jumanos and Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are
addressed in many sources (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John
1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa,
Lipan Apache, and Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester
1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on the
Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994;
Johnson and Campbell 1992).

Site Types to be Expected Along the Project Area
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in the area are prehistoric open campsites ranging in age
13

from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period. Some of these represent a single campfire
where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped for one night. Others are very
large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of people that stayed for long
periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these same campsites over a period
of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these large campsites include among
other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of
chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from making them, ground and smoothed
stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed,
bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites occur in all types of
environments, whether that be in a plush riverine environment that offered a wide variety banquet
of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the
upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different food source that could be exploited such as various
grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various
times, bison were known to graze on the northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought
after for use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expected along
the Project Area. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that were
left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The general
absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites suggest
that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time ( However, small
camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more
knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings or
surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples of
chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes
removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality
of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’
the cobble to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the
cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of
poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried away from
these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and the
thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic
scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles
14

flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further
reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks
are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of
south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are
of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in the area have been documented along
upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarry Sites
Prehistoric quarries and procurement also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic
periods, but differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose
gravels, but at times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or
quartzites were not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’.
These types of sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally
do not present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to
pick up gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped
stone remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites,
as well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
Although a handful of prehistoric quarries or procurement sites have been recorded in south Texas,
they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are two documented burned rock middens in Scurry County, but none in Mitchell County.
Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much
like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the
larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less
effective as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes
unusable, another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and
the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a
full discussion of the formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas,
see Leach and Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in
northwest Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open
campsites in both upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams. As discussed above,
only a few have been documented within Scurry County.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
15

had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of permanent
structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the area was generally not considered
safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers then began
establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Leffler and Long 1996; Leffler 1996).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.

Archaeological Site and Historic Maps Research
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within Mitchell and Scurry counties, the results simply provide the data that is
available. In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based
upon the types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. To wit, a
review of the Texas Atlas indicated that there were no known archaeological sites within one mile
of the Project Area. That said, the data that is available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the
surveys represent. The vast majority of Mitchell and Scurry County has never been subjected to
formal cultural resource surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological
record is very poorly understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished
provide at least some aspect of what the area looks like from an archaeological perspective.
Mitchell County
The earliest professional archaeological surveys conducted in Mitchell County were those by
legendary archaeologist E. B. Sayles, in the 1930s. Even with his concerted effort, since that time,
only 99 archaeological sites have been recorded within all of Mitchell County. In our opinion, this
minuscule number is a true reflection on the few archaeological surveys that have been conducted
in the county, and not at all a true representation of the number of archaeological sites that actually
exist. That said, a review of the Texas Atlas indicates that forty of these sites had been used as
open campsites from as early as the Paleoindian period, and through as late as the Late Prehistoric
periods. Mortar holes representing intensive food grinding were documented at three of the
campsites, and carved petroglyphs were found at one. Forty-four sites have been classified as
prehistoric lithic scatters. Other prehistoric sites within Mitchell County include a cutbank with
exposed bison bones, a bison killsite with associated Paleoindian points, and a crevice burial.
Seventeen historic components have been recorded in the county, including the 1880s Seven Wells
Settlement, a half-dugout and well, a series of early cattle brands etched into bedrock, WWII
bombing practice targets, multiple 1900s farmsteads and trash dumps, hand-dug wells, and a 1900s
quarry operation. The three State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) in Mitchell County include two
16

prehistoric open campsites along Morgan Creek, and one prehistoric open campsite along Lone
Wolf Creek (Atlas 2014).
Scurry County
A total of 68 archaeological sites had been recorded in Scurry County as of September 20, 2014.
Twenty-two of those are prehistoric open campsites, 15 are prehistoric lithic scatters, two are
prehistoric procurement sites, two are prehistoric burned rock middens, one is a small rock ring
that could represent a one-person sweat lodge or a hunting blind, one is a painted pictograph site,
and two are prehistoric human burial sites. The 23 historic components documented in Scurry
County include an 1890s cemetery, the Panhandle & Santa Fe Railroad trestle, the Roscoe, Snyder
& Pacific Railroad grade, and numerous 1900s farmsteads, ranch houses, and trash dumps. The
only documented State Archaeological Landmark in the county is the 80 square-foot Hermleigh
Calaboose constructed in 1913 (Atlas 2014).
A standard source of research for old aerial photographs and maps is the extensive collection of
online maps and aerial photographs available at the Perry Castañeda Library at the University of
Texas at Austin. In general, the area has apparently been historically used as ranchland pasture,
with no development other than associated ranching activities such as windmills, stock tanks,
corrals, and sparsely scattered outbuildings. As such, no historic aerial photographs were found
in this usually reliable online database.
The earliest map found was a 1952 USGS topographic map of the China Grove area (Maps 2014),
which shows no structures on or adjacent to the proposed Sunoco Pipeline. This map is not exact
by today’s standards, and it is possible that historic water tanks, corrals, outbuildings and other
structures related to early ranching activities could be encountered along the proposed rights-ofway that do not appear on any old maps. Technically, any structures older than 45 years are now
considered of interest by the Texas Historical Commission, and this should be considered when
the pipeline is excavated. As shown in Figure 3, one professional archaeological survey had been
conducted within one mile of the proposed Sunoco Pipeline. In 2013, Horizon Environmental
archaeologists surveyed selected segments of the Bridgetex Pipeline, resulting in the discovery of
no cultural resources near the proposed Sunoco Pipeline (Brownlow et al. 2014).

Background Review Summary
From this preliminary cultural resources background review, it is clear that the proposed Sunoco
Pipeline will course through predominately upland areas where there is at best a moderate
probability for deeply buried and potentially significant archaeological deposits to exist. If extant,
these upland sites may be heavily disturbed and/or redundant site types, and as such have little to
contribute to the prehistory of south Texas. These sites should be considered as non-significant,
and should not impede the pipeline’s construction as planned. However, deep loamy soils along
Little Sulphur Creek increase the potential for significant cultural deposits to exist.

17

The right-of-way had never been subjected to a cultural resources survey, and therefore the
number of undocumented sites, as well as their potential significance along the right-of-way were
unknowns. Although the number of sites and their potential significance can be modeled, because
of the scant few professional surveys that have been conducted in this area of northwest Texas to
date (and under less stringent standards than mandated today), such models are considered
unreliable. Accordingly, TAAI recommended that a full pedestrian cultural resources survey along
the Project Area right-of-way be conducted, with shovel testing at the discretion of the Project
Archaeologist.

Field Survey Goals, Methods, and Levels of Effort
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing if appropriate. The topics
addressed were site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical
framework is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems
for the South Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
In Accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the right-of-way was
conducted, with particular attention given to potential terrace deposits. In accordance with a
general “no collection” policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and
historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via sketches, field
photographs, and copious notes. Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic artifacts, particularly
those artifacts which could be considered as significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory,
such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be
collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or
the Project Archaeologist. Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences adjacent
to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and included in this report of investigations.

(NAD83); facing north.
In addition, all cutbanks, as well as rodent and mammal backdirt piles along the right-of-way were
thoroughly examined (see for example, Figure 8). Digital photographs representing the surveyed
19

right-of-way in general, and photos of newly documented archaeological site 41MH100 were
captured, and an accompanying photo log was maintained (available upon request from TAAI in
Martindale, Texas).

Survey Results
During the survey it became readily apparent that approximately 70 percent of the project’s surface
area was either mechanically disturbed, or deflated by artificial processes. However, surface
visibility was generally excellent, allowing for the discovery of any artifacts along the right-of-way.
A total of seven shovel tests were excavated along the right-of-way in areas where the Project
Archaeologist judged that there was a potential for buried and intact cultural deposits to exist
(Figure 9). No evidence of cultural materials was found in any of the seven tests, nor in any of the
numerous cutbanks and animal backdirt piles examined. The only evidence of cultural material
observed on the surface was on newly recorded site 41MH100 (described below).

it is Semi-Porcelain, and manufactured by the Wellsville, Ohio Manufacturing Company between
1905 and 1969 (Lehner 1988:510). A single shovel test (ST 4) revealed reddish brown fine sandy
loam within an apparent plow zone in the upper 20 cm, underlain with reddish brown fine sandy
clay; no artifacts were found (see Appendix A).
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This site appears to have been an historic trash dumping area downslope and south of a ca. 1930s
house site located along FM 4156, some 450 meters to the north, and the dump is situated on the
north bank of an abandoned channel of Little Sulphur Creek. The creek’s channel appears to have
migrated to the south in more modern times, and the immediate area that now encompasses the site
has been extensively cultivated and artificially terraced to prevent slope erosion. In our assessment,
the site is a heavily disturbed surficial scatter, and otherwise has shallow and eroded soils. In view
of this, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Sunoco Pipeline as currently planned
be allowed to proceed through the site, with no further archaeological investigations.

22

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations

The Sunoco Pipeline right-of-way was subjected to a full pedestrian survey by four archaeologists
on September 24, 2014. During the course of the survey, the only evidence of cultural materials
observed was on a ca. 1930s - 1940s historic trash scatter (41MH100). Our assessment of the site
is that it has been heavily disturbed, and possesses at best very little integrity and minimal research
potential. As such, Tierras Antiguas’ recommendation is that construction of the proposed pipeline
will not adversely impact potentially significant cultural deposits, and therefore should be allowed
to proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any undiscovered
cultural resources were encountered during development along the right-of-way, such finds should
be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
No artifacts were collected during this survey.
