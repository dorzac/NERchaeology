Introduction and Management Summary
LCRA proposes to rebuild a 57.3 mile-long transmission line that runs between the Kendall substation
located near Comfort, Texas and the Paleface Substation, located in Travis County near Spicewood,
Texas (Figure 1). The line runs primarily through central Kendall and Blanco counties, but is also within
far northern Hays and far western Travis counties (Figure 1). The line consists of three separate “assets:”
T-124 – Paleface to Miller Creek, 17 miles, 194 acres; T-426 – Miller Creek to Mountain Top, 4.8 miles,
52 acres; and T-342 – Mountain Top to Kendall, 35.5 miles, 423 acres (Figure 1). Rights-of way are
typically 100 ft in width, but narrow to 60 ft in places. There will be no new ROW acquisition for this
project. The project will entail a complete teardown of the existing wooden H-frame structures which
will be replaced mostly with single pole metal or cement structures. Because the line will be completely
redesigned, the new structure locations cannot be anticipated at this time. There are no known or
anticipated federal-level permits or funding involved with this project.
The Kendall to Miller Creek portion (T-342, T-426) was surveyed prior to a rebuild in 2004 by Prewitt
and Associates Inc. (PAI) (Mehalchick and Kibler 2004, TAC Permit No. 3290). The project at the time
required the selective placement of wooden H-frame structures. PAI therefore focused their efforts at
structure locations in high probability areas, although they examined all structures not located within
substation boundaries and traveled the entire ROW. Five sites (41KE155-41KE158 and 41BC139) were
recorded during the project. One of the four sites, 41KE158 was considered potentially eligible for
formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark (proxied through NRHP recommendations). Site
41KE158 is an apparent discrete, buried (30-60 cm bgs) prehistoric cultural zone located on the north
bank of Block Creek.
The T-342/T-426 line crosses mapped Holocene terraces at the Blanco River in Kendall County and at
two prongs of Miller Creek in Blanco County. PAI placed five shovel tests across the primary Blanco
River terrace (a distance of 600 m) and found 10-30 cm of gravelly clay loam over weathered bedrock
and caliche. At Miller Creek a total of six shovel tests were excavated across about 500 m to depths of up
to 70 cm, and there was no artifact recovery from any of them. Other non-Holocene alluvial settings
included Flat Rock Creek in Kendall County, where five negative shovel tests were excavated (600 m),
and at Jung and West Sister creeks, near Wenzel Spring, where seven negative shovel tests were
excavated (650 m). Site 41KE158 was located on the east side of Block Creek in Kendall County, where
five shovel tests were excavated. Elsewhere, PAI noted that the line corridor, cleared originally in 1961,
crossed upland surfaces that were described as severely deflated.
After careful review of the PAI report, it was the opinion of LCRA’s Cultural Resources staff that the
level and intensity of survey was sufficient for the portion of the presently proposed project it covered.
The location of 41KE158 was revisited and the original interpretation was confirmed. Its boundaries will
be communicated to LCRA project engineers, who will incorporate it as an avoidance area for new
transmission line structures. Given that there has been traffic across this site for at least 50 years, since
the date of original construction, it is recommended that vehicular movement only be restricted during
wet weather, as was recommended during the previous project review (Prikryl 2004).
The T-124 portion of the line was surveyed by LCRA Cultural Resources staff in 2004 prior to regularly
scheduled maintenance (Hixson et. al 2006:358). Three archaeological sites (41TV2104, 41BC135 and
41BC140) were recorded, and 41TV115/196 was revisited, although conflicting information on the latter
suggests it was misplotted originally. Regardless, none of these four sites were considered to be eligible
for formal SAL status.
Cultural resource assessments for maintenance projects are covered under LCRA’s Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with the Texas Historical Commission. Such projects are assessed at a level

commensurate with expected impacts and reported upon in LCRA’s Annual Report of Investigations.
After reviewing the 2006 report as well as project maps and field notes, LCRA Cultural Resources staff
was of the opinion that T-124
124 between the Miller Creek and Paleface substations had not been
investigated at a level sufficient for the proposed rebuild. LCRA Cultural Resources staff identified
approximately 5.8 miles of area considered to be of high probability for containing cultural resources that
might be eligible for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks.
LCRA requested concurrence from the Texas Historical Commission that the Kendall to Paleface
Transmission Line Rebuild Project be considered fully
fully surveyed for the 475 acres between the Kendall
and Miller Creek substations, but that additional cultural resources survey investigations would take place
on the 194 acres between the Miller Creek and Paleface substations. Because the total project ar
area is
approximately 669 acres, and LCRA’s MOU states that projects greater than 300 acres in size may
require a separate antiquities permit, LCRA requested that an Antiquities Permit be issued for the full
project.
The THC concurred with these recommendations
recommendations on April 8, 2011, and subsequently issued TAC Permit
No. 5931 for the project. The following report focuses on the T-124
T 124 portion of the project area within
eastern Blanco, extreme northern Hays,
Hays, and western Travis counties, and also discusses a rev
revisit to
41KE158. No artifacts were collected during this project.

Environmental Background
The T-124
124 project area is located
within the edge of the Edwards
Plateau/Canyonlands and crosses
deeply dissected Cretaceous--aged
Glen Rose and Hensell Sand
formations (Barnes 1974, 1981)
(Figure 2).
). There is one very small
area of Holocene terrace deposits
along Miller Creek,, at the west end
of the project area. Soils are of the
shallow loamy Brackett-Purves--Doss
association and deep clayey loamy
Krum Lewisville series (Dittemore
and Allison 1979), the latter crossed
by the line along the Miller Creek
drainage.
Figure 2. Typical environment.

The project area is within the
Colorado River watershed, with the
Pedernales River being the primary drainage component for T
T-124,
124, which it crosses very near Hametts
Crossing near Hamilton Pool and the Westcave Preserve. Other name
named streams, from west to east, are
Miller Creek,, Flat Creek, Cypress Creek, and Fall Creek. There are several other smaller streams as well.
The vegetation has been mapped as Live Oak
Oak-Ashe Juniper and Live Oak-Ashe
Ashe Juniper-Mesquite
Juniper
Parks,
indicating typical canopy over nine feet in height growing in clusters or individually over grasses and
forbs (McMahon
ahon et. al 1984). Numerous large cypress trees were also observed within the cross
cross-cutting
canyons.

Cultural Background
Prehistoric
The project area is within the Central Texas archaeological region as defined by Prewitt (1981) and
generally accepted by others (Collins 1995). As such the standard chronological partitions for the region
form the basis for archaeological expectations in the area.
Archaeologists and cultural historians have been dividing and redividing, and at times recombining the
12,000 to 18,000 year period of time that is generally recognized as that during which humans were
present on the Texas, (and North American) landscape. Probably the most widely-used chronology for
central Texas stems from Collins (1995), augmented and slightly revised in 2004 (Collins 2004).
This chronology consists of Paleoindian (which includes “pre-Clovis”), Early Middle and Late Archaic
(and sometimes Transitional Archaic), Late Prehistoric I and II, and Historic, or post-contact periods.
Each of these time periods have characteristics that enable some aspect of the human condition to
illustrate changes from periods before or after. These are often based on a technological and/or social
response to the changing natural environment and the pressure placed upon it by its human inhabitants.
These periods can be easily explored and expanded upon by any interested reader, so the basic
characteristics of each, as commonly described, are only briefly summarized in this report.
Table 1. The prehistoric chronology used in this report follows that presented in Johnson and Goode (1994) and
generalized by Collins (1995) in years before present (B.P.).

The Paleoindian period is typically considered a time of big game hunters (e.g. Clovis) who pursued nowextinct forms of prey widely across the North American continent during the end of the last ice age. More
recent research indicates these people had a much more diverse subsistence base than previously thought,
were probably more settled, and had the social and mental complexity necessary to construct and maintain
abstract representational systems. These people had also perfected the art of stone tool production,
creating implements that were never again matched in the level of required manufacturing skill.
At the end of the ice age, about 10,000 years ago, changing climates forced a change in adaptive
strategies as the megafauna of the Pleistocene disappeared and people were forced to rely on smallersized prey. This long-lived Archaic period (ca. 7,5000 years long) is divided into three subperiods (Early,
Middle, Late) that are recognized by distinctive tool types (typically projectile points) that suggest
technological change and perhaps social identity. There are other technological adaptations such as the
level of food processing, typically seen through the creative use of heated rocks and levels and types of
gathered (as opposed to hunted) resources. Fluctuations in interpersonal violence are suggestive of a
varying resource structure and the human demands placed upon it.
The Late Prehistoric Period begins about 1,200 years ago with the introduction of the bow and arrow, a
more efficient weapon delivery system than the larger shaft-mounted spearheads (darts) used previously.
Increased hunting efficiency led generally to larger populations, continuing the cycle of resource stress. It
4

has been argued that an Archaic lifeway (generalized hunting and gathering) persisted through the first
half of this Late Prehistoric period, until about 700 years ago when bison, which had been present
intermittently, reappeared, and with them a renewed emphasis on nomadic hunting of big game, and
perhaps the arrival of a new set of people (Toyah) on the Texas landscape. Most researchers, however,
continue to signify the beginning of the Late Prehistoric Period with the introduction of the bow and
arrow. About 700 years ago, ceramics were also introduced; another technological advance that allowed
the more efficient and thorough processing of foodstuffs, especially grains and seeds. This was especially
important for the youngest components of the human population, and certainly encouraged reproductive
success.
The Historic, or contact period, begins with the early Spanish entradas, followed by the missions and
accompanying presidios. The effort to Christianize the native populations, coupled with sweeping
diseases, quickly resulted in the extirpation of indigenous groups, with those voids filled by newcomers
from the Plains who had expertly adopted a highly mobile, horse-based raiding style. These are the
Apache and Comanche, among others, which exemplify the normative, idealized view of the American
Indian.
Historic
The T-124 project area is within or very near Blanco County, which will serve as the primary historic
backdrop for this report. During the mid eighteenth century, Spanish prospectors used a trail that ran due
north from San Antonio to reach the Los Almagres mine on the southern edge of the Llano Uplift region.
In February 1756, Miranda y Flores, a military officer on his way to investigate the validity of the mines,
camped on the Pedernales River not far from present-day Johnson City (Patten 1970). Miranda’s party
included an Apache interpreter since the area north and west of San Antonio at that time was part of
Apacheria. Later, Comanche groups laid claim to the area.
The area that became Blanco County remained unsettled by people of European descent until the 1850s.
James Callahan, Eli Hinds, and Joseph Bird were among the earliest settlers (Bigham 2008). Bird
established the community that later became Round Mountain.
The first settlements along the Blanco River were established in the early 1850s and a few years later the
town of Pittsburgh was laid out on the south side of the river. When Blanco County was established in
1858 a new town by the same name was founded as the county seat on the north side of the river opposite
Pittsburgh. In the 1870s, homesteaders living along the Pedernales River began petitioning the county to
move the courthouse closer to the geographic center of the county (Ogilvie 2008). Part of this effort
involved establishing a new community on the Pedernales River. The new town was named Johnson City
after James Polk Johnson, one of the movement’s leaders. In 1890, an election made Johnson City the
county seat.
Nearer T-124 is the community of Cypress Mill, originally called Fuchs Mill after the owners of the
original mill on nearby Cypress Creek (Smyrl 2011a). A post office called Cypress Mill opened in 1874
and by the mid 1880s there were both grist and saw mills and a cotton gin. By 1900 there were about 200
people in the community. The population declined throughout the twentieth century and stood at 56 in
2000.
At the western end of the T-124 is the town of Spicewood. Spicewood became something of a
community center after a post office opened there in 1899, and it soon eclipsed nearby Rockvale in
importance (Smyrl 2011b). The future State Highway 71 was constructed in the 1940s and in 1949 the
Haynie Flat school district was consolidated into Spicewoods,’ although Marble Falls consolidated with
Spicewood in 1952.

Previous Investigations
Pedernales Falls State Park has 62 archaeological sites recorded during surveys by the Travis County
Archeological Society in 1962-1963 and by Texas Parks and Wildlife archeologists in 1970, 1989, and
1996 (Howard et. al 2003). These surveys took place on the portion of the park that lies south of the
Pedernales River. Sixteen of the Pedernales Falls State Park’s sites, or 26 percent of all the recorded
sites, have been recommended for formal SAL designation. These include such prehistoric site types as
rockshelters, open campsites, terrace sites, burned rock middens, and one lithic procurement site. In
addition, two Historic farmsteads dating to the 1800s were recommended for SAL designation.
One of the most investigated sites in Pedernales Falls State Park is the Wheatley Site, 41BC114 (Greer
1976). The site is located in an upland context and cultural deposits there are confined to the surface or
near surface. It was considered significant because most of the artifacts, including over a thousand bonetempered potsherds, belong to the Toyah interval. The fieldwork consisted of intensive surface collecting
and stripping of the surface soil to recover buried artifacts.
Site 41BC1, the only rock art site recorded in Blanco County, is located on private land near Pedernales
Fall State Park ( Brock et al. 2006 ). It contains approximately 25 pictographs on the walls of a small
cave fronting the river. The pictographs include depictions of a bison, human or human-like figures,
geometric designs, and at least one example of Historic graffiti perhaps dating to the nineteenth century.
A small portion of the remains of one of the pictographs mostly destroyed by spalling was radiocarbon
dated to Cal. A.D. 1160-1310 (2 sigma), approximately the period when bison reentered the region and
the beginning of the Toyah interval.
In 1959 a student at the University of Texas conducted reconnaissance and limited testing of several sites
along Cypress Creek and the Pedernales River in the vicinity of Hamilton Pool (Lathan 1959). Eighteen
sites, most of them shelters, were discussed. A number of “Angosturoid” and Plainview points were
described, as well as Archaic and Late Prehistoric points. Painted pebbles recovered at 41TV49 and a
reported fiber sandal lent support to a proposed Lower Pecos affiliation. The transmission line crosses
near Lathan’s 41TV58 and 41TV59, the latter of which was described as 100 yards long with an overhang
up to 35 feet in width.
Another cluster of 13 sites is located near the project area. These were recorded by a student at the
University of Texas in 1995 on the Hupedo Ranch. A number of these were described as Early Archaic in
age, and included open camps and lithic scatters.
In 1986 The University of Texas surveyed Hamilton Pool Park (Robinson 1986, in Chavez et. al 2006)
and revisited Lathan’s burned rock midden 41TV52 as well as the main shelter and surrounding deposits,
41TV242. The shelter, midden, and open camp 41TV1250 (which may be the same as 41TV242) are all
listed as SALs.
When Travis County acquired the 2,300-acre Reimers Ranch, a cultural resources survey recorded 28
archaeological sites, most of which were prehistoric in age (Chavez et. al 2006). Eight sites were
considered potentially eligible for formal State Archeological Landmark listing, with four of these being
historic sites with unknown associations. Three open campsites and a rock shelter were considered to
have additional research potential.
The Sleeper site, 41BT65 is located on a permanent tributary of Sandy Creek (Johnson 1991). The
portion of the site within the highway ROW was excavated by the Texas State Department of Highways
and Public Transportation in the 1970s. Remains of an Early Archaic camp including burned rock
6

cooking features and milling equipment were uncovered in the moderately deep alluvial deposits along
the creek.
In 2004, T-124 was surveyed by LCRA staff prior to standard right-of-way maintenance activities.
Conducted under LCRA’s annual permit, such surveys are at a level of intensity commensurate with
anticipated impacts, which are typically limited to shredding of the easement and mechanical mulching of
brush. During the survey three previously unrecorded archaeological sites (41TV2104, 41BC135,
41BC140) were recorded, and one (41TV115/41TV196) was revisited, the latter now considered to be
41TV2396). None of these sites were considered at the time to have deposits warranting additional work
or avoidance (Hixson et. al 2006:358).

Research Design and Methods
The archaeological survey and subsequent analysis and reporting followed procedures and standards set
forth by the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). The goals
of the survey were to:
1)

2)
3)
4)
5)

Indentify all cultural resource sites that are potentially eligible for formal listing as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs)) and that may be impacted by construction and/or future
maintenance of the transmission line;
Evaluate such sites as to their potential eligibility for formal listing as SALs
Provide supporting information to the THC that will allow it to comment on LCRA’s
findings;
Develop avoidance measures that allow LCRA TSC to minimize impacts to potential SALeligible archaeological sites;
If avoidance is impossible, draft potential testing and/or mitigation measures to be covered under
a separate Antiquities Permit.

The cultural resources survey focused on high probability areas (HPAs) as identified by a review of
topographic, geologic, and historic maps along with soils and other pertinent data (Figure 3, Figure 4,
Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Factors used to define HPAs included distance from permanent or
intermittent water sources, types of soils and their potentials for containing buried cultural materials,
locations and types of previously recorded sites within the broader physiographic and cultural region, and
locations of structures depicted on modern and georeferenced historical maps. HPAs were designed to be
adjustable in the field to account for consistent negative findings or, potentially, when potential SALeligible sites are found in unexpected settings.
Approximately 5.80 miles (70 acres) of this line were identified as having a high to moderate probability
of containing SAL-eligible archaeological sites. No potential historic structures were identified on
available recent or historical maps within 500 feet of the proposed centerline.
High probability areas and cultural resource sites were assessed by teams of archaeologists following
minimum survey standards. Survey transects were at 30 m intervals at most. Shovel tests were planned
to conform to minimum standards of 16 tests per mile of high probability area. Where shallow, nonaggrading soils, sparse vegetation, exposed bedrock and a high degree of erosion are observed, it was
determined that a lesser number (including none) was sufficient. Shovel tests were excavated 30-40 cm
on a side and in 20 cm increments, with all matrix passed through 1/4 inch mesh or hand sorted when
screening was impossible. They were excavated to bedrock or its equivalent in settings where there was
potential for buried deposits.

Cultural resource sites were shovel tested according to the amount of visibility, depth of soils, and size of
site. Shovel tests, features and site centroids were recorded by GPS, which typically has a 2-3 meter error
range. Sketch maps were typically drawn in the field to aid with quality control. Sites and representative
survey areas were photo documented. All sites were recorded on the TexSite database and submitted to
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for assignment of permanent trinomials. Because
the ROW will be within easements on privately owned land, a no collection policy was established and
maintained. Project notes, records, photographs and other data may be curated if deemed useful and
appropriate.
Historic sites were researched at a level commensurate with their research potential. Artifact scatters
associated with structural remains or mapped historic structures were researched further, first through
discussion with present landowners or others who may be aware of past residents and land use, and
secondly through courthouse and deed record searches. Increasingly, web-based resources, especially
from local genealogical or historical societies, are able to provide a great level of historical detail, and
were included with other archival research when appropriate.

Results of Investigations
As a result of investigations along
the T-124 portion of the Kendall to
Paleface transmission line rebuild
project, four previously unrecorded
archaeological sites were recorded,
and three sites were revisited
(Table 2). A total of 31 shovel tests
were excavated, less than half of
the number suggested by minimum
survey standards for the amount of
high probability area surveyed.
However, given that the vast
majority of the project area crosses
upland areas of exposed bedrock
and shallow to very shallow soils
with typically excellent visibility,
this number is considered adequate.
41BC167
Site 41BC167 is a 230 m-long lithic
scatter located along the flanks of a
deeply incised canyon formed by a
short, unnamed tributary to the
Pedernales River (Figure 8). It is
on
undivided
Cow
Creek
Limestone and Hammett Shale
formations covered by Krum Clay
soils. The western portion of the
site area is within moderately deep
soils that have recently been tilled.
The eastern and main portion of the
site is within extremely shallow

Figure 8. Site 41BC167.

13

soils pocketed in exposed limestone bedrock. Surrounding the ROW are dense to moderately dense
juniper woods.
The site consists of numerous (about 200) pieces of chert debitage which are mostly thin and decorticate.
A fragment of a Late Archaic Frio point, a Late Archaic proximal biface/projectile, a thin biface
fragment, a uniface, and two small bidirectional cores were also seen. Because of excellent visibility
within the plowed field and pocketed soils, both upon a non-aggrading landform, no shovel tests were
excavated.
The site is interpreted as a work station or short term camp and is probably associated with shelters that
are presumed to be within the canyon below. The two small, carefully reduced bifacial cobble cores
suggest that raw stone material was not readily available near this location.
Site 41BC167 is a surficial lithic scatter that is useful for locational information, and places activities in
the area during the Late Archaic period. The site, however, has very little additional research potential,
and is not considered eligible for SAL status. No further work is recommended.
41BC168
Site 41BC168 is a 100 mdiameter
multicomponent
apparent historic homestead and
prehistoric open campsite (Figure
9). It is located about 700 m
southwest of the Robinson
Community hall which is mapped
as just north of FM 2766. It is on
the low, gently rolling stream-side
terrace of a short, unnamed
tributary to Miller Creek. A very
minor
draw
marks
the
northeastern boundary of the site.
It is upon the Glen Rose
limestone formation covered by
Purves
association
soils.
Vegetation consists of open
grasslands with mottes of oak
trees and scattered young
mesquite, prickly pear and
agarita.
The
prehistoric
component
consists of scattered lithic
debitage, a thin biface and a small
amount
of
buried
burned
limestone,
which
was
encountered while testing the
historic component.
The historic component consists
of two piles of limestone rubble
located approximately 50 feet

apart. The more southerly of the two is about 70 feet in length, and may represent a chimney fall that has
been bisected by the ranch road. The more northerly is about 35 feet in length. Both are about 30 feet
wide. A low stone fence runs parallel and across the small draw to the northeast. South of the ROW,
along the unnamed creek, is an operating windmill that supplies water to a relatively crude cement cattle
trough.
Historic artifacts were of household nature, and consisted of purple, aqua, brown and olive bottle glass as
well as flat clear glass and the large, dimpled base of a Duraglass container. There were both cut and wire
nails, although more cut nails were seen than wire. Other metal included various thin metal fragments
and pieces of wire, as well as cast iron pieces, probably from a stove and water pipe. There was also a
small can dump that included what appeared to be the fender of a Ford Model T or Model A. Plain
whiteware was also present, some of which was very thick. A relatively large Bakelite two-hole button
was found on the surface, and a small ceramic four-hole button was found in a shovel test. Figure 10
illustrates typical artifacts from the site.
A total of six shovel tests (KP 13-18) were
excavated within the ROW, concentrated
around the stone rubble piles. Soils were not
much deeper than 20 cm. Artifact recovery
was low to moderate, with the greatest
recovery from between the two rubble piles,
where both prehistoric and historic materials
were present. A moderate amount of burned
rock was present in KP13, as was a few flakes,
an edge modified flake, and a possible arrow
point fragment, and a much lesser amount of
prehistoric material in KP14.

The artifacts observed at 41BC168 indicate a
principal occupation period around the turn of
the 20th century at a time when the property was in the ownership of James Denison Henslee and his heirs.
The site is located with a 160-acre abstract patented to Thomas J. Trammell in 1882. A native of
Arkansas, Trammell was in Texas by 1880, when the U.S. Census showed he was a 33-year-old farmer
living in the area along Lower Flat Creek in eastern Blanco County. There he lived with his wife,
Elizabeth, also of Arkansas, and their five children: Nancy F., Anna J., Syntha M., Thomas R., and Ellen.
Deed records in Johnson City indicate the Trammells owned other tracts of land in the county, and two
years after receiving the patent, T.J. and Elizabeth, joined by Caroline Pyburn (relationship unknown),
sold the 160 acres to Mrs. Maggie Storey for $400. T.J. Trammell died in 1916 and Elizabeth died in
1943; both are buried in the Lower Flat Creek Cemetery. (Moursund 1981: 241; Blanco County Patent
Records: 2/168; Blanco County Deed Records: 8/537)
The Storey family retained ownership of the property until 1904, when E.M. Storey (most likely Edward
M. Storey), then a resident of Caldwell County, conveyed the tract to J.D. Henslee of Blanco County for
the sum of $320. The low per acreage value of both early transactions indicates there were no significant
improvements to the land prior to 1904, and other records show the Henslees utilized the Trammell tract
and surrounding acreage as a ranchstead, raising goats and sheep on the land. James Denison Henslee
(1857-1918) was born in central Tennessee, southeast of Nashville. He married Catherine (Kate) Idella
Holman (1885-1926), a native of Burnet County, Texas, and the couple moved to Blanco County in 1893,
settling in the area along Miller’s Creek, where they raised five children: Bettie Lou, Matena, Maude,
Delzie Otilie, and Uncas Norville (various spelling variations). The 1900 census also showed that a 23year-old teacher named W.A. Evans lived on the land with his two-year-old daughter Ruth. It is uncertain,
15

but most likely, that a schoolhouse existed on the property at that time. Formal recognition of the
institution occurred in 1916, when J.D. Henslee deeded one acre of land within the Trammell tract
immediately north of the target site and along the northern property line to the county trustees for use by
the Wilson School District No. 9. Henslee retained the standard reversion clause. (Moursand 1981: 421422; Blanco County Deed Records: 20/491 and 30/496; U.S. Census 1900; Johnson City Masonic
Cemetery Survey).
Following her husband’s death, and only a year before her own, Kate Henslee transferred the remaining
Trammell land along with surrounding property totaling 681 acres to son Uncas. The 1925 conveyance
itemized the various landholdings, as well as stock animals—78 goats and 230 sheep—and specified the
right for Kate to live in the residence—“known as the old house”—on the property until her death. It
further noted the presence of barns, cribs, a well, corrals, a garden, fences, and other buildings as
improvements. It is not known, however, if the house was on the Trammell portion of the farmstead or
not. If the site is that of a residence, it could also have been where the teacher lived. Further evidence of
land use is included in a 1924 transference of interest in the family land from Kate’s daughter Maude, the
wife of Willie B. Herwig, for a dollar an acre. The deed noted the 680 acres constituted what was known
as the “J.D. Henslee Ranch South-East of the town of Johnson City.” (Blanco County Deed Records:
42/405, 42/406, and 40/408).
Uncas N. Henslee, joined by his wife, Cora, secured a deed of trust on the farmstead upon the death of
Kate Henslee in 1926. The instrument, involving the Federal Land Bank of Houston, served as a record
that the mortgagees (Henslees) had continuously used it for “agricultural purposes in a husbandman-like
manner” and that they would in the future maintain the existing fences and buildings then on the land.
There are no indications to the contrary, and at the end of January 1931, at the height of the Great
Depression, U.N. and Cora Henslee sold the 681-acre homestead, minus the one acre for the school, to
L.L. and O.V. Parker for $7,000. There were additional transactions of the property in 1940, 1944, and
1949, culminating with the purchase by Milton Sultimeier in 1950 for $10 and assumption of a note
totaling $11,500. Of particular interest in the various transactions is the one in 1944 from Cecil and Merle
Catlett to Ernest and Marie Hodges of Gillespie County. The deed itemized the stock animals at 375 head
of sheep, 335 head of goats, and four head of cattle. It further noted the transfer of farm equipment and
consideration of business stocks. (Blanco County Deed of Trust Records: 10/40; Blanco County Deed
Records: 47/59, 53/543, 56/446, 60/480, and 62/71)
Site 41BC168 is most likely associated with the early 20th-century ownership of the J.D. Henslee family,
which operated the surrounding land for agricultural purposes, primarily the raising of sheep and goats.
There were no improvements on the land prior to their ownership and it remained with the family for two
generations, from 1904 to 1931. Because the target site was within a larger tract that was in itself part of a
sizeable ranch operation, there is no conclusive proof of whether the house site was occupied by family
members or by a schoolteacher known to have resided on the land as well. Regardless, the condition of
the site has been compromised over the years, and primary architectural features are no longer intact.
The prehistoric component appears to be a small prehistoric open camp that was later the location of a
homestead dating to around 1900. The homestead appears to have been placed upon the main portion of
the prehistoric component, resulting in mixing of artifacts in thin soils.
Both components at 41BC168 are severely disturbed and lack a level of integrity that would allow
additional information to be obtained from them. They are therefore considered to be fully recorded and
ineligible for formal SAL status.

41BC169
Site 41BC169 is a 100 m-diameter lithic scatter located on a prominent knoll between Flat Creek and the
Pedernales River. The knoll is separated by a saddle from a higher ridge system to the south, but rises
over 100 ft above the valley floor (Figure 11). The knoll is comprised of Glen Rose Limestone and is
surrounded by the Hensell Sand formation. Soils are mapped as of the Brackett association. The soils are
extremely thin and support short grasses, oak and persimmon.
The site consists of about 100 flakes and other pieces of tertiary debitage, with much smaller amounts of
secondary and primary flakes. Two flake tools, a core, and a thin biface were seen. The artifacts seemed
to be concentrated on two limestone benches on the south and east sides of the knoll. Due to the exposed
limestone and obviously shallow, pocketed soils, no shovel tests were excavated.
The site is interpreted as a lookout station/short term hunting station/lithic workshop. It has excellent
visibility, especially to the north. All lithic material was imported.
Site 41BC169 is a surficial lithic
scatter that is useful for locational
information. The site, however,
has very little additional research
potential, and is not considered
eligible for SAL status.
No
further work is recommended.
41TV2396
Site 41TV2396 is a 400 m-long
lithic
scatter
with
burned
limestone and an apparent small
burned rock midden located north
of FM 968 in extreme western
Travis County (Figure 12). It is
located on the high canyon rim
above Cypress Creek, which joins
the Pedernales River about 2.5 km
to the southwest. Cypress Creek
is spring fed and holds water year
round. The site is upon the
Hensell Sand formation which is
covered by Tarrant series soils
supporting short grasses, scattered
cacti, juniper, mesquite and oak
(Figure 13).
Much of the
surrounding area has been
cleared.
Within the Cypress
Creek canyon is a lush
microenvironment of cypress,
palmetto, tall grasses, sedges and

forbs.
Underneath
the
transmission line there is a sheer drop of at least one hundred feet to the canyon floor, which is accessible
along a short interfluvial divide to the east.

17

Site 41TV115 and 41TV196 have both been plotted at or near this location. Site 41TV115 is described as
being on the Glover property. According the present landowner, Ted Stewart, the only other owners of
the site in question have been the Young family. Site 41TV196 is described as being on an unnamed
tributary 2.25 miles north-northwest of Hamilton Pool. Site 41TV2396 is 2.5 miles northwest of
Hamilton Pool and on Cypress Creek. Following the directions for 41TV196 results in a location
consistent with that described for the site. Therefore, it is apparent that 41TV115 and 41TV196 have both
been misplotted and 41TV2396 should not be considered a revisit of either of these two sites.
The site as encountered consists of numerous interior flakes and pieces of debitage, mostly seen within
and along the existing two-track road. Scattered burned limestone was also seen within the transmission
line ROW.
Six shovel tests (KP26-31) were
excavated within the site’s
boundaries.
Recovery was
minimal in most, consisting of a
very few pieces of debitage or
shatter in 15-30 cm of reddish,
clayey
soil
over
decayed
limestone.
Tests 27 and 29,
however, encountered moderate to
dense
amounts
of
burned
limestone and a combined total of
30 pieces of debitage in 12-25 cm
of soil over limestone. Minute
pieces of charcoal may also have
been present.
These deposits
appear to be intact and relatively
unaffected by historic land use,
and are restricted to a low
mounded area.
The site is therefore described as a
lithic scatter with a small burned
rock midden or large hearth that is
relatively intact. There is very
little research potential in the lithic
scatter portion of the site. The
midden portion of the site, which
is about 15 m in diameter, may
have additional research potential.
Figure 12. Site 41TV2396.
It is therefore recommended that
this small area of the site be
avoided by any construction-related impacts. If this area cannot be avoided, then additional
investigations, coordinated through the Texas Historical Commission, should be considered.

Previously Recorded Sites
Sites 41BC135, 41BC140 and 41TV2104
were recorded during transmission line
maintenance in 2004. All were described
ass minor lithic scatters and considered to
be ineligible for formal SAL status. Site
41BC135 and 41BC140 are located on
either side of Miller Creek at the far
western end of T-124.
124. These sites were
both revisited and seen to have very small
amounts of chipping
pping debris in shallow to
nonexistent soils on bedrock.
Site
41BC140 may extend a bit further to the
east than previously described, however
the change is minor and does not affect the
overall interpretation or recommendations

across Cypress Creek from 41TV2396. It
was seen to be an extremely minor lithic scatter possibly exploiting remnant nodular chert seen on the
ground surface. The terrain in this area is very rough due to limestone boulders that appear to have
hav been
upturned by root plowing or other clearing activities (Figure
(

). There are no further recommendations
for this site.
Other Areas
On the north side of SH 71 are a set of
minor tributaries to the Colorado River.
Four shovel tests (KP1-4)
4) were placed
judgmentally in this area. There was no
recovery in shallow soils that became clay
or bedrock at depths of 20-30
30 cm. No
artifacts were seen on the surface or in the
various exposures that were examined.
examin
Just south of SH 71 is the deep canyon of
Fall Creek and its associated tributaries.
As no impacts are expected with the
canyons, the canyon rims and divides were
examined. Soils here were consistently
shallow with exposed bedrock common.
No shovel
el tests were considered to be
necessary here.
No artifacts were
encountered.

Figure 14. Site 41TV2104.

One shovel test (KP5) was placed along a small tributary stream about 2 miles south of Fall Creek. Soils
in this area were shallow with generally excellent visibility. No artifacts
artifacts were encountered.
Shovel tests KP7 and KP8 were placed along a small tributary system at the Hays/Travis County Line.
There was no recovery and no other artifacts were encountered.

19

The north side of the Pedernales River was not accessible during this survey, but was assessed based on
aerial imagery and the previous maintenance work. Both indicated that the entire landform is a shallow,
rocky slope. No artifacts were encountered during previous field work.
Both sides of Flat Creek were examined, and shovel test KP25 was placed on the north side. Both sides
were highly eroded with shallow soils and bedrock. On the south side of Flat Creek a single isolated
chert chunk was seen. A very deep crevice was noted where the cliff face is slowing falling away. There
is a high probability for shelters within the canyon.
41KE158
During the 2004 cultural resources
survey of the T-342 corridor,
Prewitt &Associates recorded a
potentially significant prehistoric
site, 41KE158, on the east side of
Block Creek five miles northwest
of Comfort (Mehalchick and
Kibler 2004) (Figure 15). Their
shovel testing indicated that a
discrete zone of chert debitage and
scattered burned rock is present in
the vicinity of Structure 54/5 and
at a point 110 meters to the east
immediately below the valley
escarpment, suggesting that the
site extends the width of the
Figure 15. Location of 41KE158 on Rafter Hollow USGS quad.
terrace, which the transmission
line crosses at a roughly 90 degree
angle. Their survey-level investigation could not confirm that these deposits were: 1) undisturbed, 2)
contained intact features, and 3) and did in fact extend across the entire site area.
On May 4, 2011 two archaeologists contracted by LCRA’s Cultural Resources revisited the site to
reassess the findings of Prewitt & Associates and in particular to locate areas within the site where
significant or potentially significant cultural deposits might be absent. During the revisit, shovel tests
were placed at roughly 20 meter intervals eastwards from Structure 54/5 to a point 20 meters west of the
talus slope that ascends to the escarpment overlooking the terrace (Figure 16). These tests mostly
followed the T-342 centerline and extended across the entire upper alluvial terrace which Prewitt &
Associates had designated T1. The T1 terrace within the transmission line corridor coincides with the
41KE158 site area except at the extreme western end, a 20 meter stretch between the gravel ranch road
and terrace edge, where a Prewitt & Associates shovel test encountered gravelly fill in disturbed
secondary context.
The new shovel testing found that a moderately dense stratum of lithics, burned rock, and Rabdotus snails
was present across the site area between 20 cm and 45cm below ground surface. Multiple large burned
rocks were encountered at depths of 35 and 45 cm, although no actual stone pavements were identified.
Another possible hearth was struck at a depth of 20 cm in the easternmost shovel test near the talus slope.
A shovel test placed three meters west of Structure 54/5 at the far west end of the site encountered the
edge another probable stone hearth resting at 29 cm below the surface in addition to chert debitage and
nine large Rabdotus snails all at the same general elevation. A shovel test was also placed outside the
limits of 41KE158 in the area between the ranch road and the terrace edge. It encountered the same
gravelly fill that Prewitt & Associates did in 2004.
20

The revisit investigation confirms the
presence of a cultural zone that is up
to 25 cm thick with the top of the
zone roughly at 20 cm below surface,
although a few artifacts were found at
higher elevations. The cultural zone
appears to extend across the entire
site area as previously defined by
Prewitt & Associates. No obvious
signs of disturbances were seen in the
test holes or on the ground surface
except for a few shallow depressions
around Structure 54/5 that may
represent previous pole locations, and
a few other, wider depressions near
the edge of the ROW that may be
from past tree removal. Five of the
new shovel tests encountered multiple
Figure 16. Site 41KE158.
burned rocks at specific depths that
may represent edges of stone hearths. Further survey-level investigation would probably not resolve the
issue of intact features and deposits.
The site is considered to be potentially eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark. It is
recommended that no structures be placed within the site’s boundaries, although given the site’s location
within a previously disturbed ROW, there are no recommendations for limiting vehicular traffic except
for during wet weather. It is also recommended that the existing wooden H-frame structures be pulled
from the ground using standard methods, as there will be little to no additional disturbance by their
removal. If it is determined that a structure must be placed within the site’s boundaries, then additional
test-level investigations, coordinated through the Texas Historical Commission, are recommended.

Conclusions and Recommendations
LCRA proposes to rebuild an existing set of transmission lines, T-342, T-426 and T-124, which runs
between the Kendall Substation in Kendall County and the Paleface Substation in Travis County. Lines
T-342 and T-426 were intensively surveyed by Prewitt and Associates (PAI) in 2004, and T-124 received
reconnaissance level survey by LCRA in 2004. Therefore, LCRA requested and received TAC Permit #
5931 for the project, which was scoped to include intensive survey for the 17 mile-long T-124 section
only. This is the easternmost portion of the project, and runs between the Paleface and Miller Creek
substations. Site 41KE158, recorded by PAI on the T-342 portion of the line, was also revisited and
intensively shovel tested, confirming PAI’s 2004 recommendations that the site is potentially significant.
Approximately 5.8 miles (34 percent) of the 17 mile-long T-124 was surveyed as high probability area.
Another 20-30 percent of the line received windshield survey while traveling between high probability
areas. A total of 31 shovel tests were excavated within the T-124 portion of the line, and an additional 10
shovel tests were placed within 41KE158. This is well below the minimum recommend number of shovel
test for a project of this size but it is considered to be an adequate level of testing given the overwhelming
predominance of shallow to very shallow soils in limestone bedrock settings.
As a result of the investigations, four previously unrecorded sites (41BC167, 41BC168, 41BC169,
41TV2396) were documented along T-124 and three sites (41BC135, 41BC140, 41TV2104) were
21

revisited. Site 41KE158 was revisited on T-342. Sites 41TV115 and 41TV196 are plotted within or very
near the transmission line ROW at the location of 41TV2396; however, these sites appear to be
misplotted and are not formally included within this report (Table 2).

The prehistoric sites are primarily lithic scatters and are often associated with nearby canyons which are
known to contain occupied rock shelters. The scatters are the result of tool production or maintenance
occurring on chert that has been transported from other locations. Camping activities occurred along
minor streams, and also along the canyon edges. Only Late Archaic diagnostic tools were encountered
during the project.
One historic homestead (41BC168) was recorded along a small stream and dates to after 1904. It was
part of the J.D. Henslee Ranchstead and may have housed members of the Henslee family or perhaps a
teacher for a nearby schoolhouse. This site also has a minor prehistoric component.
Of the six sites for which recommendations are made (see Table 2) only 41TV2396 and 41KE158 are felt
to require any avoidance. Site 41TV2396 is a lithic scatter with burned rock located on the high edge of
the Cypress Creek canyon. The majority of the site is scattered, surficial and lacking additional research
value. Two shovel tests within the site identified what appeared to be a small burned rock midden,
possibly with organic preservation. It is recommended that a 20 m buffer be established around this
feature and that no subsurface impacts occur within that area, which is located about 50 m northeast of
present (existing) structure 6/1.. The burned rock midden portion of the site is considered to be
potentially eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark.
Site 41KE158, located on the T-342 portion of the line, is a 120 m-long open campsite that is largely
buried under 20-30 cm of alluvium. It appears to contain multiple hearth features and at least one tool
was encountered. The presence of snail shell indicates additional research potential. Site 41KE158 is
considered to be potentially eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark. It is
recommended that no subsurface impacts occur within the site’s boundaries, with the exception of
removing the existing wooden H-frame structure by pulling it straight up out of the ground. Because the
site is within an existing easement which has seen traffic for over 50 years, there are no recommended
restrictions for vehicular travel, except for limiting the movement of heavy equipment in wet conditions.
The remainder of the sites, 41BC135, 41BC140, 41BC167, 41BC168, 41BC169 and 41TV2104 are
considered to be fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to the existing ROW and are not
considered to be eligible for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks.
22

It is recommended that the Kendall to Paleface Transmission Line Upgrade project be allowed to proceed
in all areas with the understanding that the restricted areas will be avoided as discussed above. If
avoidance becomes impossible, than additional testing or mitigative investigations, coordinated though
the Texas Historical Commission, may be necessary.
