ARCHAEOLOGICAL MONITORING INVESTIGATIONS
for the San Antonio Water System VIA Transit-Westside Multimodal Transit Center Phase II Water Main Replacement Project

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Medina Consulting Company and San Antonio Water System (SAWS), SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted cultural resources monitoring of an underground water
main replacement project in support of the SAWS VIA Metropolitan Transit-Westside Multimodal
Transit Center, Phase II Project (hereafter referred to as SAWS VIA). The work involved replacing and
installing a 12-inch and 8-inch water main entirely contained within the existing right-of-way (ROW) of
North Medina, West Travis, and West Houston Streets.
The SAWS VIA project area consists of three main trenches: a 650-foot-long (200-meter [m]) trench on
the west side of North Medina Street; a 350-foot-long (106-m) trench along the south side of West
Houston Street; and a 350-foot-long trench along the south side of West Travis Street. One lateral extends
off the medial portion of the West Travis Street trench for the width of the ROW. On average, the
trenches were 3 feet (0.9 m) wide and were excavated to 5 feet (1.5 m) deep. All work was conducted
within the 40-foot-wide (12-m) existing street ROWs. Thus the area of potential effects (APE) totals 0.10
acre, or 772.2 cubic yards, of existing, city-owned street ROW located in downtown San Antonio, Bexar
County, Texas, with vertical disturbances ranging from 5 to 12 feet (1.5 to 3.7 m) deep.
The work performed by SWCA included an in-depth historical and archival records review followed by
archaeological construction monitoring in an effort to identify, record, and characterize any extant historic
resources or deposits within the project area. The focus of the study was the mapped location of the
Alazán Acequia (41BX620), constructed in 1874. According to the San Antonio Office of Historic
Preservation (SA-OHP) Acequia Overlay Map 15-57 and 15-58, the Alazán Acequia traverses the project
area from northwest to southeast, potentially intersecting the project in two places: along West Travis
Street, immediately east of its intersection with North Medina; and along West Houston Street just west
of its intersection with North Frio. Additionally, previous cultural investigative reports have projected an
alignment route of the Alazán Acequia as potentially intersecting the project area in two places: along
North Medina Street, immediately south of its intersection at West Travis Street; and along West Houston
Street midway between North Medina Street and North Frio.
SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was performed during construction activities that occurred
between September 8–11, 17, 23–26, 29–30 and October 13–14, 2014. The goal of the work was to
examine and assess any cultural deposits revealed in the construction, adequately document the cultural
resources, and provide sufficient information to make determinations on age and significance. All work
was done in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission and the
Council for Texas Archeologists.
The construction monitoring identified moderately disturbed soils mixed with construction materials (e.g.,
red brick fragments, concrete fragments, limestone cut blocks, etc.) dating to the early to mid-twentieth
century, primarily related to previous construction activity and utilities. Evidence of the Alazán Acequia
was documented within the North Medina Trench, 15 feet south of its intersection with West Travis
Street. The unlined ditch was characterized by concave lens, filled with a light gray, gravelly fill. The
profile of the acequia was only observed within the east profile wall of the trench. The installation of a
concrete duct bank for an existing utility immediately north of the acequia has destroyed any evidence of
the acequia within the west wall of the trench. No cultural materials were observed within or adjacent to
the acequia. Because no cultural materials or outstanding construction techniques were observed, SWCA
determined that the exposed portion of the Alazán Acequia within the project area is not significant.
However, the specific location of the acequia within the SAWS VIA project area is considered valuable
as it contributes important information regarding the location and trajectory of the Alazán Acequia as a
whole.

All work within the construction monitoring area was conducted within moderately disturbed deposits
predominantly dating to the early to mid-twentieth century. SWCA made a reasonable and good faith
effort to identify historic properties within the project area. Based on the results of the monitoring efforts,
the excavation within the monitored portion of the SAWS VIA project encountered a segment of the
Alazán Acequia. Although the eligibility of the larger Alazan Acequia system for designation as a State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL) has yet to be determined, the narrow portion within the project area is not a
significant contributing component. Existing disturbances and lack of significant structural or cultural
materials have jeopardized the section’s potential to yield new or important information regarding the
acequia. In addition, no significant cultural materials or additional cultural features were identified within
the project area. As such, no further work is recommended for the SAWS VIA Project.

INTRODUCTION

Medina, West Travis, and West Houston Streets
are depicted in Figure 2, the scope of the
Antiquities Permit only included the monitoring of
excavations within the areas shown to transect
both projected routes of the Alazán Acequia. All
work was done in accordance with the standards
and guidelines of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 6988. The monitoring occurred during
various site visits between September 8–11, 17,
23–26, 29–30 and October 13–14, 2014.

On behalf of Medina Consulting Company and
San Antonio Water System (SAWS), SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted
cultural resources monitoring of an underground
water main replacement project in support of the
SAWS VIA Metropolitan Transit-Westside
Multimodal Transit Center, Phase II Project
(SAWS VIA) (Figure 1). The work involved
replacing and installing a 12-inch and 8-inch water
main entirely contained within the existing rightsof-way (ROW) of North Medina, West Travis, and
West Houston Streets.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The investigations began with a review of
historical and archival records followed by
archaeological monitoring of construction in an
effort to identify, record, and characterize any
extant historic resources or deposits within the
project area. The background review determined
that the project area is consistently depicted in
historic maps with a segment of the Alazán
Acequia (41BX620). This historic canal is
believed to be between 6 inches and 24 inches
(0.15 m and 0.61 m) below the modern ground
surface (Dippel and Victor 2012). In addition, the
project area is located within the City of San
Antonio’s Cattleman Square Historic District.

Located in west downtown San Antonio, Texas,
the project area is in a highly developed urban
setting on a level landform between the San Pedro
and Alazán Creeks. The project is about 1 mile
northeast of the Alamo and 0.35 mile southwest of
the Interstate 35 and Highway 87 intersection.
This location is characterized by an industrial area
with large warehouse and building complexes that
have been continuously occupied since the city’s
historic beginnings. The Union Pacific Railroad
track, formerly the International and Great
Northern Railroad (I&GNRR), and the I&GNRR
Passenger Station are west of the overall project
area.

According to the San Antonio Office of Historic
Preservation (SA-OHP) Acequia Overlay Map 1557 and 15-58, the Alazán Acequia traverses the
project area from northwest to southeast,
potentially intersecting the project in two places:
along West Travis Street, immediately east of its
intersection with North Medina; and along West
Houston Street just west of its intersection with
North Frio (Figure 2). Additionally, cultural
investigative reports under review by the SA-OHP
have projected an alignment route of the Alazán
Acequia as potentially intersecting the project area
in two places: along North Medina Street,
immediately south of its intersection at West
Travis Street; and along West Houston Street
midway between North Medina Street and North
Frio. While excavations along the length of North

The SAWS VIA project area consists of three
main trenches: a 650-foot-long (200-meter [m])
trench on the west side of North Medina Street; a
350-foot-long (106-m) trench along the south side
of West Houston Street; and a 350-foot-long
trench along the south side of West Travis Street.
One lateral extends off the medial portion of the
West Travis Street trench for the width of the
ROW. On average, the trenches were 3 feet (0.9
m) wide and were excavated to 5 feet (1.5 m)
deep. All work was conducted within the 40-footwide (12-m) existing street ROWs. Thus the area
of potential effects (APE) totals 0.10 acre, or
772.2 cubic yards, of existing, city-owned street
ROW located in downtown San Antonio, Bexar
County, Texas, with vertical disturbances ranging
from 5 to 12 feet (1.5 to 3.7 m) deep.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

where they encountered a hunter-gather tribe
named Payaya. In their village named Yanaguana,
the Payaya lived in simple huts made of
brushwood and grass. The river and village were
renamed after San Antonio de Padua by Terán and
Massenet (Johnston 1947).

GEOLOGY
The underlying geology of the project area is 100
percent Quaternary-age Fluviatile terrace deposits
adjacent to the San Pedro and Alazán Creek
(Barnes 1983). These terrace deposits consist of
predominately gravel, limestone, dolomite, and
chert, with sand, silt, and clay. Most low terrace
deposits along entrenched waterways like San
Pedro Creek are above flood level (Barnes 1983).

Further Spanish exploration was conducted in
1709 by Father Antonio de San Buenaventura y
Olivares. Father Olivares was the first to express
interest in setting up a mission in the San Antonio
area (Fehrenbach 2012; Johnston 1947).
SPANISH MISSIONS

SOILS

After a series of missions had been established in
what would become eastern Texas, the Spanish
government in the New World decided to begin
settlement in 1718 at a bend in the San Antonio
River. Mission San Antonio de Valero was
founded on May 1, 1718, and followed four days
later by the nearby San Antonio de Béxar Presidio
and the civil settlement, Villa de Béxar. The
location was a convenient stopping point on the
Camino Real, the newly established highway
founded in 1691 by the previously mentioned
Domingo Terán de Los Ríos and Father Damián
Massenet to connect Mexico to the East Texas
missions. However, in 1719 war between France
and Spain resulted in the withdrawal of the
Spanish from the east Texas missions, who
reestablished their mission communities near the
settlement along the San Antonio River.

The project area soils are mapped as 100 percent
Houston Black clay terrace deposits with 1 to 3
percent slopes (NRCS 2014). The Houston series
consists of clayey soils that are very deep,
moderately well-drained, and very slowly
permeable. These soils formed from weakly
consolidated calcareous clays and marls of
Cretaceous Age, and are found on nearly level to
moderately sloping uplands (NRCS 2014).

CULTURAL HISTORY
HISTORIC PERIOD
The Historic period in central Texas theoretically
begins with the arrival of Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de
Vaca and the survivors of the Narváez expedition
along the Texas coast in 1528 (Krieger 2002).
European incursions, however, into south-central
Texas were initially rare, and the first Europeans
did not settle in this region until around A.D. 1700.
Spanish incursions into the region from the late
seventeenth century on, left valuable information
on native groups and tribes. Several scholars,
including Hester (1989) and Newcomb (2002),
have provided historical accounts of Native
Americans and their interactions with the Spanish,
the Republic of Mexico, the Texas Republic, and
the United States throughout the region.

Mission San Antonio de Valero, originally located
west of San Pedro Springs, survived three moves
and numerous setbacks during its early years
(Schoelwer 2012). The mission was moved to the
west side of the San Antonio River around 1730.
After a disastrous epidemic in 1739, the mission
was moved to its present location on higher
ground (Cruz 2012). Mission San Antonio de
Valero, what is now known as The Alamo.
There is little available information on aboriginal
groups and their ways of life except for the
fragmentary data Spanish missionaries gathered.
The general project area was reportedly inhabited
by several aboriginal groups, which included
Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, Comanche, Jumano,
Catqueza, and Karankawa (Cecil and Greene

The San Antonio area was first explored in 1691
by the Governor of the Spanish Province of Texas,
Domingo Terán de los Ríos, and Father Damián
Massenet. The pair traveled to San Pedro Springs

but so many died there that their numbers declined
rapidly (Campbell 1988:106, 121–123). By the
end of the mission period, European expansion,
disease, and intrusions by other Native American
peoples had decimated many Native American
groups. The small numbers of surviving Payaya
and Juanca were acculturated into mission life.
The last references to the Juanca and Payaya were
recorded in 1754 and 1789, respectively, in the
waning days of the mission (Campbell 1988:98,
123). By that time, intrusive groups such as the
Tonkawa, Apache, and Comanche had moved into
the region to fill the void. Outside of the missions,
few sites attributable to these groups have been
investigated. To complicate matters, many
aboriginal ways of life endured even after contact
with the Spanish. For example, manufacture of
stone tools continued even for many groups
settling in the missions (Fox 1979).

2012; Foster 1995; Newcomb 2002). In the San
Antonio area and areas to the south, these groups
have been referred to collectively as Coahuiltecans
because of an assumed similarity in way of life,
but many individual groups may have existed
(Campbell 1988). Particular Coahuiltecan groups,
such as the Payaya and Juanca, have been
identified as occupying the San Antonio area
(Campbell 1988).
Some native groups made contact with the Spanish
in San Antonio seeking protection from the
Apache at newly established Spanish missions,
settlements, and presidios like the Mission San
Antonio de Valero and the Presidio San Antonio
de Bexar (Chipman 1992:117). The Spanish in
turn, actively recruited the Native Americans to
help bolster their settlements on this northern
frontier in response to a perceived increase of
French influence in Louisiana and east Texas.

San Antonio became the capital of Spanish Texas
in 1773. By 1778, the settlement had a population
of 2,060 including those Indians living in the
missions. However, conditions within the
settlement were often described as poor, resulting
from its location at the edge of Spanish-controlled
Texas. The population was comprised of a mix of
Europeans, mestizos, and a few slaves. By 1795,
all the missions in San Antonio were secularized
and Mission San Antonio de Valero, later called
the Alamo, was converted to a military barracks
(Fehrenbach 1978).

The Spanish presence around San Antonio is best
seen as part of the complex European political
picture of the time. The beginning of the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries was an
era of more-permanent contact between Europeans
and Native Americans. Specifically, increasing
numbers of Spanish moved northward out of
Mexico establishing settlements and missions on
their northern frontier (see Castañeda [1936–1958]
and Bolton [1970] for extended discussions of the
mission system and Indian relations in Texas and
the San Antonio area).

SPANISH ACEQUIAS

The Spanish Missions also served as a point of
contact between the southward-advancing
Apaches and the Spanish, with native groups often
caught in between. Disease and hostile encounters
with Europeans and intruding groups such as the
Apache were already wreaking their inevitable and
disastrous havoc on native social structures and
economic systems by this time.

As the Spanish established missions in Bexar
County, they also devised an irrigation and water
supply system using spring water. Friars
supervised the labor of Indians, settlers, and
soldiers to construct acequias, or canals, and dams
(Cox 2005). The system distributed water for
agriculture, personal consumption, and other
household uses (Porter 2009:48). The first
acequias were simple, soil-lined, gravity-flow
canals whose depressions can still be seen today in
certain areas of Brackenridge Park (Cox et al.
1999). San Antonio’s acequia system represents
the first municipal water system in what would
later become the United States. The acequia
system continued to supply water until the early
1900s, and is a contributing element of the San

Establishment of the mission system in the first
half of the eighteenth century to its ultimate
demise around 1800 brought the peaceful
movement of some indigenous groups into mission
life, but others were forced or moved in to escape
the increasing hostilities of southward-moving
Apaches and Comanches. Many of the Payaya and
Juanca lived at Mission San Antonio de Valero,

over internal political struggles between the
peninsulares (natives of Spain) and the criollos
(those of Spanish blood born in America)
(Campbell 2003:89).

Antonio Missions National Historic Park (National
Register of Historic Places [NRHP] No.
78003147). As the population of San Antonio
grew during the nineteenth century, the acequias
could not meet the demand and eventually became
a source of disease as people increasingly used
them to dispose of waste (Porter 2009:96). The
canals also required constant maintenance to keep
them functioning properly. The Espada Acequia is
the only acequia that still flows today.

One of these revolutions occurred in San Antonio
on January 21, 1811, when retired militia captain
Juan Bautista de las Casas and some coconspirators
captured
Governor
Salcedo
(Campbell 2003:90; Richardson et al. 1981:41).
Las Casas proclaimed himself leader of the
revolutionary government and then set about
arresting royalists and confiscating their property
(Campbell 2003:90). This revolution lasted 39
days when a royalist counterrevolutionary force
led by Juan Manuel Zambrano overthrew Las
Casas and returned control of San Antonio over to
Governor Salcedo (Campbell 2003:91). Las Casas
was arrested and sent to Mexico for trial. In
Monclova, he was found guilty of treason and
executed. His head was sent back to San Antonio
to be displayed on Military Plaza (Caldwell 2012;
Ramsdell 1968).

Between 1718 and 1744, the first canal was dug at
the San Antonio Springs, the Acequia Madre (also
known as Alamo Madre and Alamo Ditch). It
diverted water from the east side of the headwaters
of the San Antonio River, just below San Antonio
Springs, in present-day Brackenridge Park. The
Spanish missions consumed spring water
exclusively until 1761 when a well was dug at the
Alamo in anticipation that hostile Indians would
block access to the river. Around 1776 a dam was
built to divert spring water into a second canal, the
Upper Labor ditch, which was associated with the
San Pedro Springs.

The residents of San Antonio supported Mexican
independence in 1813 but the town was recaptured
by Royalist forces in the battles of Alazán Creek
and Medina. During this period of unrest,
conditions in Texas worsened. Inadequate
provisions and neglected agricultural fields along
with the fear of political and military upheavals
forced many settlers to abandon their homes and
move elsewhere (Fehrenbach 2012; Heusinger
1951).

The purpose of the acequias were to provide water
to the missions and their associated farm lands
during the mission era. As the population grew in
the 1800s, the acequias became the main source of
drinking water for San Antonio residents.
However, sanitation soon became an issue with the
ditches and in 1834 a cholera epidemic struck San
Antonio.
Unfortunately, the epidemic was not immediately
linked to the use of the acequias, but plans to
improve the ditches were soon proposed. In 1878,
the Waterworks Company was established to
provide clean drinking water to the city after the
acequias were deemed unsanitary for the evergrowing population (Cox 1993; Cox 1995; Nickels
et al. 1996). By 1900, most of the city’s acequias
were abandoned and filled in (Cox 1993; Cox
1995; Nickels et al. 1996).

Other concerns at this time for New Spain and
Spanish Texas were the ‘filibusters’ or AngloAmerican intruders with political designs (e.g.,
Philip Nolan in 1801, Louis Aury in 1816, and
James Long in 1821) (Campbell 2003; Richardson
et al. 1981). The filibuster incursion with the most
notoriety was the Gutiérrez-Magee expedition in
1812 (Campbell 2003; Richardson et al. 1981).
José Bernardo Gutiérrez de Lara and Augustus
William Magee led an expedition into Texas from
Louisiana in order to forcibly take control of
Texas. From August of 1812 to April of 1813, the
Gutiérrez-Magee expedition traveled westward
across Texas capturing Nacogdoches, Trinidad de
Salcedo, and La Bahía. On March 28, 1813, near
the juncture of Salado Creek and the San Antonio

SPANISH TEXAS REBELLIONS
The beginning of the nineteenth century was a
turbulent time of numerous insurrections and
conflicts within New Spain and Spanish Texas
(Campbell 2003). These conflicts, in part, arose

province uninhabited with the exception of San
Antonio (Richardson et al. 1981:43). Not until the
1820s, was any effort again expended to attract
settlement into the province (Richardson et al.
1981).

River, the Battle of Salado was fought between
Spanish royalists and the republican army of the
Gutiérrez-Magee expedition (Campbell 2003:91–
92; Richardson et al. 1981:42). The republican
army defeated the Spanish royalist army and
Gutiérrez entered San Antonio on April 1, 1813.
Governor Salcedo and about a dozen officers
surrendered (Campbell 2003:91–92; Richardson et
al. 1981:42).

As part of the fearsome lesson of rebellion,
General Arredondo left the bodies of the
republican soldiers from the Battle of the Medina
unburied (Campbell 2003; Thonhoff 2012). It was
not until 1822 (nine years after the battle) when
the first governor of Texas, José Félix
Trespalacios, in the newly formed Republic of
Mexico had the bones collected and buried at the
battlefield (Thonhoff 2012).

On April 6, 1813, in San Antonio, Gutiérrez
proclaimed a declaration of independence, forming
the first Republic of Texas with Gutiérrez as
“President Protector of the State of Texas”
(Campbell 2003:93). However, for a variety of
reasons Gutiérrez’s reign was short, lasting about
three months when General José Álvarez de
Toledo y Dubois deposed him (Campbell 2003:93;
McGraw et al. 1998; Richardson et al. 1981;
Thonhoff 2012).

The devastating defeat of the republican army at
the Battle of the Medina ended the GutiérrezMagee expedition and Texas’ first republic
(Thonhoff 2012). This battle is notable in that it
was one of the largest in North America prior to
the Civil War, which had consequences that
affected the demography and economic
development of the region for years after the
conflict (McGraw et al. 1998:285). However,
possibly due to the tumultuous times of the era and
the outcome of the battle, it has largely been
forgotten and the exact location of the battle and
the burial site lost (McGraw et al. 1998; Thonhoff
2012).

New Spain responded to the rebellion by sending
General Joaquín de Arredondo and his army to
San Antonio in order to crush the rebels.
Arredondo and his army left Laredo in early
August and marched to San Antonio along the
Laredo Road. Toledo and the republican army
intercepted the Spanish army south of the Medina
River in order to spare San Antonio from the
impending conflict (Schwarz and Thonhoff 1985).
Thus, on August 18, 1813, the two armies met and
fought the Battle of the Medina, which is
sometimes referred to as the bloodiest battle ever
fought on Texas soil (Campbell 2003:93;
Thonhoff 2012). General Arredondo’s forces
consisted of 1,830 soldiers while Toledo’s
republican army contained 1,400 Anglos, Tejanos,
Indians, and former royalists (Campbell 2003;
Thonhoff 2012).

Although rebellion and revolt had been
suppressed, the feelings of discontent between the
upper and lower classes and the dissatisfaction
with Old Spain remained (Richardson et al. 1981).
Finally, in early 1821, the conservative upper
classes of Mexico represented by Agustín de
Iturbide met with rebel leader Vicente Guerrero
and negotiated the Plan of Iguala on February 24,
1821. This plan, in part, proclaimed New Spain
independent from Old Spain and was to be
governed by a constitutional monarchy that
protected the Catholic Church and racial equality
(Richardson et al. 1981:52). Sensing the
inevitable, Viceroy Juan O’Donojú signed the
Treaty of Córdoba that recognized the Plan of
Iguala and Spanish Texas became Mexican Texas
(Campbell 2003:97; Richardson et al. 1981:52).

After four hours of heavy fighting, the Spanish
army overwhelmingly defeated the republican
army by killing all but about 100 soldiers, who
escaped. General Arredondo and his troops
followed up their victory by traveling to San
Antonio and subsequently eastward toward
Nacogdoches executing, imprisoning, and
confiscating the property of anyone associated
with the rebellion (Campbell 2003; Richardson et
al. 1981). Arredondo’s eradication of all Texas
Anglo-Americans and liberal Mexicans left the

San Antonio on October 12, 1835, to set up camp.
Several small skirmishes occurred over the next
few months while reinforcements and supplies
were acquired and attack plans were debated.

TEXAS SETTLEMENT AND INDEPENDENCE
After Mexico gained independence from Spain,
the newly formed country used a policy of land
grants to attract settlers into the area, including
Anglos from the United States, to help settle the
sparsely populated northern regions of Mexico.
During the 1820s, Empresario (or colonization
agent) Green DeWitt obtained grants from the
Mexican government to settle 400 families along
the Guadalupe, San Marcos, and Lavaca rivers
(Baumgartner and Vollentine 2012; Campbell
2003; Richardson et al. 1981). Early settlers of
DeWitt’s Colony migrated between Gonzales and
Lavaca, finally settling around Gonzales, due to
harassment from Comanches and property
boundary disputes with settlers of the De León
grant (Richardson et al. 1981). Subsequent
settlement in the area centered on waterways.

A Mexican deserter informed the Texians that the
Mexican army’s morale and rations were low.
Upon receiving this news, a council was held to
decide on whether to attack. Commanding Officer,
Edward Burleson and most of the other officers
voted to end the siege. One man spoke up and
asked “Who will go with Old Ben Milam into San
Antonio?” (House 1949:47). Approximately 300
men joined Milam and the battle finally began on
December 5, 1835.
The Texians dug trenches between houses they
occupied for cover and destroyed the other
buildings around them preventing cover for the
Mexican troops. General Cós split his troops
between San Antonio de Béxar and the Alamo but
was unsuccessful at defeating the Texians. When
he tried to then focus the majority of his troops at
the Alamo, some of his men deserted realizing the
battle was lost. By the morning of December 9,
1835, Cós surrendered San Antonio to Burleson
and the Texian troops (Barr 2012; House 1949).

Because of a request from an increasing
population seeking assistance from Indian raids,
the Mexican government sent a 6-pound cannon to
Gonzales in 1831 for their protection
(Baumgartner and Vollentine 2012). Subsequently,
the attendance by delegates of DeWitt’s Colony at
the conventions discussing a separation in
statehood from Coahuila in 1832 and 1833 and the
Consultation of 1835 were viewed as disloyalty
and the Mexican government sent forces to
retrieve the cannon (Baumgartner and Vollentine
2012; Campbell 2003; Richardson et al. 1981).

On February 23, 1836, nearly 150 Texian
volunteers took refuge from the approaching
Mexican Army in the Alamo Mission in San
Antonio under orders from Colonel William B.
Travis (Hatch 1999). A standoff between the
Texian Revolutionary Army and the Mexican
Army, lasting 13 days, ended in complete
annihilation of the Alamo defenders and a victory
for the Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa
Anna (Hardin 1994; Huffines 1999).

On October 2, 1835, Lieutenant Francisco
Castañeda and 100 dragoons converged with about
150 Texians about a mile east of present day Cost,
Texas (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2012;
Campbell 2003; Richardson et al. 1981). This
conflict was brief, resulting in one shot from the
Gonzales “come and take it” cannon, but it did
signal the beginning of the Texas Revolution
(Baumgartner and Vollentine 2012; Campbell
2003; Hardin 1994; Metz 2001; Richardson et al.
1981).

BATTLE OF THE ALAMO
The Alamo Garrison had been acquired following
the defeat of Mexican General Martin Perfecto de
Cós’ army in the December 1835 Battle of San
Antonio. The subsequent formation of the
Matamoros Expedition cost the Alamo much
needed supplies and men. This expedition was
created with the intentions of invading Mexico
through the city of Matamoros; however, the plan
was never executed due to political turmoil in the
Texas government. Some relief came over the next

Emboldened by their success at Gonzales, the
Texian volunteers headed for San Antonio. In
response, General Martín Perfecto de Cós, along
with 650 men, fortified the plaza of San Antonio
de Béxar west of the San Antonio River and the
Alamo to the east. Texian volunteers arrived in

Texians and their garrison, Santa Anna’s desire for
battle increased. According to Mexican Lt. José de
la Pena, Santa Anna “wanted to cause a sensation
and would have regretted taking the Alamo
without clamor and without bloodshed, for some
believed that without these there is no glory”
(Hatch 1999:36). The final decision to attack the
Alamo with full force was made the following
day, March 5, 1836 (Hatch 1999).

few months with the arrivals of Colonel Jim
Bowie, Colonel William B. Travis, and David
Crockett (Hatch 1999).
General Santa Anna arrived in San Antonio with
between 1,800 and 2,100 men on February 23,
1836. Upon their arrival Colonel Travis ordered
his men to retreat into the Alamo (Hatch 1999).
General Santa Anna raised a red flag signifying
“no quarter–no mercy” and received a cannon shot
from the Texians in defiance (Hatch 1999:20). In a
letter sent February 24, 1836 addressed to the
“People of Texas and all Americans in the World,”
Colonel Travis pleas for assistance and states “if
this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain
myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who
never forgets what is due his own honor & that of
his country. Victory or Death” (Groneman
2001:6).

The Mexican army moved into position just after
midnight on March 6, 1836 and waited for the
signal to attack. This call came around five
o’clock in the morning when a soldier cried out
“Viva Santa Anna!” (Huffines 1999:134). With
the element of surprise lost, Santa Anna ordered
his troops to begin the attack on the Alamo
garrison (Huffines 1999).
The Texians awoke to the sound of the
approaching army and rushed to their posts. Santa
Anna’s troops began their march in columns but
became disorganized before reaching the Alamo
walls. The constant fire from the eastern Texian
battery caused many of the Mexican troops to
corner themselves under the north wall. This
confusion made them easy targets for the Texians
stationed above. An impatient Santa Anna then
released the reserve battalions who eventually
breached the north wall and southwest corner of
the Alamo. Once inside the garrison, no mercy
was given to the Alamo defenders (Hatch 1999).

On March 2, 1836, General Santa Anna located a
covered bridge to the northeast of the Alamo
giving them a sheltered area within “pistol shot”
(Huffines 1999:97) of the Alamo and posted
Jiménez’ Battalion at the new location. The
conjectural location of this “covered road” has
been plotted by some, but its locale cannot be
conclusively proven (Huffines 1999:99). General
Santa Anna ordered many small attacks in an
attempt to breach the Alamo’s walls. Many
Mexicans lost their lives in the process; however,
no Texians were killed in the 12-day siege before
the final battle (Hatch 1999; Huffines 1999).

This gruesome battle, lasting only 90 minutes, left
every Texian combatant dead. The number of
Mexican dead is a matter of debate, with numbers
ranging from 70–1,600; uncounted more were
wounded. The Texian’s bodies were burned on
funeral pyres on either side of the Alameda. Santa
Anna won the battle at the Alamo but victory and
independence was won by the Texians two weeks
later in the Battle of San Jacinto (Hatch 1999;
Huffines 1999).

On March 4, 1836, General Santa Anna held a
Council of War to decide plans of attack and the
fate of prisoners. Despite objections from some of
the Mexican officers, Santa Anna’s decision to
take no prisoners was reaffirmed. Meanwhile,
Travis informed the Alamo defenders that James
B. Bonham would no longer be sending
reinforcements. He gave a speech to the men and
asked them to choose between surrender, escaping,
or fighting to the death.

REPUBLIC OF TEXAS ERA

As the Mexicans finalized their attack strategies
and battle preparations commenced, Colonel
Travis was entertaining the idea of surrender. He
sent a Mexican woman from San Antonio to seek
the terms of a possible surrender with the Mexican
General. Upon learning about the poor state of the

After the events that transpired during the War of
Texas Independence, San Antonio and central
Texas continued to grow. Population estimates
drawn from tax rolls suggest that the population in
Texas from 1836–1846 increased by 269 percent

Victorian mansions built next to modern offices
and homes (Butterfield 1968; Fehrenbach 2012).

(Campbell 2003:159). It was during this time that
the phrase Gone to Texas became legendary and
the initials G.T.T. were chalked on doors across
the southern United States (Campbell 2003:159;
Handbook of Texas Online 2012).

On March 2, 1861, Texas seceded from the Union
and soon after the Civil War began. San Antonio
became a Confederate storage area as well as a
location where military units could be organized;
however, the city kept its distance from most of
the actual fighting (Fehrenbach 2012).

Among those to move into central Texas were
German immigrants who came in to the area as a
result of the Society for the Protection of German
Immigrants in Texas. This society, founded in
1845 by Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels, brought a
massive influx of German immigrants into central
Texas (Fox et al. 1997a:2).

After the Civil War, San Antonio continued to
grow larger, spurred on by the arrival of the
railroad in 1877 (Fehrenbach 2012; House 1949).
Industries such as cattle, distribution, ranching,
mercantile, gas, oil, and military centers in San
Antonio prospered. The city served as the
distribution point for the Mexico-U.S. border as
well as the rest of the southwest. At the turn of the
twentieth century, San Antonio was the largest city
in Texas with a population of more than 53,000.
Much of the city’s growth after the Civil War was
a result of an influx of southerners fleeing the
decimated, reconstruction-era south. An additional
population increase came after 1910, when large
numbers of Mexicans began moving into Texas to
escape the Mexican Revolution (Fehrenbach
1978).

UNITED STATES PERIOD (1845–1900)
After Texas entered the Union in 1845, San
Antonio’s already diverse population grew
dramatically. The Irish came to Texas between the
late 1830s and early 1840s and established a
community called Irish Flat. They built houses of
rock in this area that resembled cottages found in
Ireland. The Irish Flat community was three
blocks southwest of the project area. It was
bounded by 6th Street to the north, Commerce
Street to the south, Bowie Street to the east, and
Avenue C (present-day Broadway) to the west.

Modernization increased dramatically between the
1880s and the 1890s, compared to the rest of the
United States. Civic government, utilities, electric
lights and street railways, street paving and
maintenance, water supply, telephones, hospitals,
and a city power plant were all built or planned
around this time (Butterfield 1968; Fehrenbach
2012).

Germans also settled in San Antonio in the 1850s
introducing the Bier Halle (Butterfield 1968:21) to
the area. The rapid increase in population had been
a direct result of the influx of German-speaking
settlers. Until 1877, German-speaking people
outnumbered both Hispanics and Anglos. French
immigrants added artists and artisans to the culture
of the city. Later immigrants to the area included
the Polish, Italian, Greek, Syrian and in 1910, the
Chinese, all of which formed small communities
within the city of San Antonio. The first Polish
group, led by the Rev. Leopold Moczygemba,
arrived in San Antonio in 1854 and built St.
Michael’s Parish in 1866 (Rybczyk 2000). The
church was rebuilt in the 1920s, but was later
demolished by construction of the Hemisphere.

MODERN PERIOD (1900–1950)
According to one source, a few city events
occurred in or around the project area in the early
1900s, although the project area itself was not the
focus of these activities and remained an outlying
property. In May of 1903, the second Annual
Horse Show was held on Alamo Plaza. In 1924, a
13-story Medical Arts Building was built on the
corner of Houston Street and Avenue E. In
addition, the San Antonio Express dedicated a new
building located on the corner of Avenue E and
3rd Street (Heusinger 1951).

Culture and architecture from each immigrant
community has seeped into San Antonio and
merged together, forming a rich cultural
community. This diverse culture is evident in
downtown San Antonio with historic missions and

10

for the San Antonio Water System VIA Transit-Westside Multimodal Transit Center Phase II Water Main Replacement Project

Alamo (1718), Mission Concepción (1731),
Mission San José (1720), Mission San Juan
Capistrano (1731), and Mission San Francisco de
la Espada (1741) (Fehrenbach 2012). Visitors also
enjoy other architecturally important historic
structures like San Fernando Cathedral (1758), the
Spanish Governor’s Palace (1749), the Quadrangle
at Fort Sam Houston (1878), and the Bexar
County Courthouse (1891) (Fehrenbach 2012).

In 1921, a disastrous flood engulfed Houston and
St. Mary’s streets with approximately 2.7 m of
water. The Olmos Dam was built in response to
this event to prevent further flooding. Sections of
the San Antonio River were straightened and
widened in areas to control the water flow.
Another recommendation was to construct an
underground channel in downtown San Antonio
and to cover portions of the river with concrete.
This last idea upset some people, but a
compromise was eventually agreed upon to create
a Riverwalk with shops and restaurants along the
water channel. Construction of this Riverwalk was
completed in 1941 (House 1949; Long 2012).

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review determined that one
previously recorded archaeological site, 41BX620
the Alazán Acequia, is within the project area
(SA-OHP Acequia Map Sheets 15-57 and 15-58).
Furthermore, the review indicated that the city
block defined by North Medina, West Travis,
North Frio, and West Commerce Streets was
surveyed by Blanton & Associates, Inc. in 2013
(Griffith et al. 2013). Additionally, areas adjacent
to the current project area have been previously
surveyed in 2014 by SWCA (Stotts et al. 2014).
The project area is located within the City of San
Antonio’s locally designated Cattleman Square
Historic District. Within a 0.5-mile radius of the
project area are 20 other previously recorded sites,
12 archaeological investigations, six properties
listed on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), two Official Texas Historical Markers
(OTHM), the Main and Military Plazas NRHP
Historic Districts, and 80 to 100 local
neighborhood survey properties (Figure 3, Atlas
2014).

As the United States entered World War II, San
Antonio became an important military center and
other city activities and construction ceased for
nearly five years (Heusinger 1951). Although Fort
Sam Houston was established in 1876, and Kelly,
Randolph, and Brooks Air Force bases were
established prior to 1930, all area military facilities
experienced growth during World War II.
Lackland Air Force Base was created from a
portion of Kelly in 1942. With the exception of
Kelly, all remain active military training centers.
Tourism is one of San Antonio’s most important
industries, drawing tens of thousands of visitors
every year. More recent features include theme
parks, zoos, museums, gardens, parks, and
sporting attractions. The Riverwalk, also known as
the Paseo del Rio, consists of over 2.5 miles of
shops and is probably one of San Antonio’s most
visited attractions. The missions in San Antonio
are another huge tourist attraction. San Antonio
Missions National Historical Park includes The

mile before momentarily redirecting west then
south for the majority of its span. In total, the
Alazán Acequia spanned approximately 4 miles
and was completed by 1875. It was soon evident,
however, that the acequia was not structurally
sufficient for its purpose, failing to follow the
traditional methods of utilizing contour lines to
direct water flow (Cox 2005). In an attempt to
salvage the project, the acequia was deepened in
November of 1876 and lined with a smooth
concrete finish to promote water flow. The result
in some areas was a 10-foot-deep ditch that
extended 2 feet into natural bedrock (Cox 2005).
Unfortunately, the Alazán Acequia was still
considered to be a structural failure and a “waste
of public funds” (Cox 2005:71). The Alazán ditch
was closed and filled in by 1900 (Cox 2005).

In 2013, Blanton & Associates, Inc. conducted
backhoe trenching investigations across the VIA
Metropolitan Transit Westside Multi-Modal
Transit Center Phase 2 Project area to determine if
its proposed redevelopment would impact the
Alazán Acequia. The investigations resulted in the
exposure of four historic features, one of which
was identified by the SA-OHP to be the remains of
the Alazán Acequia. The feature was identified in
three areas of three separate trenches on the west
side of the project area. The unlined ditch rests
between 53 and 180 centimeters (cm) below
ground surface and consists of a loose, gravelly,
silty clay containing dispersed cultural materials
(decaying wood, glass, saw cut bone, whiteware
sherds, and metal fragments) (Griffith et al. 2013).
In 2014, SWCA conducted archaeological
monitoring investigations adjacent to the current
project area on behalf of City Public Service
Energy. The work consisted of the installation of
overhead and underground electric lines, in
addition to underground gas lines within the
existing ROW of North Medina Street, beginning
south of West Commerce Street and extending just
north of West Travis Street. Segments of the
utility installations also extended within the ROW
of West Travis Street and within the parking lot of
the I&GNRR Passenger Station. Monitoring
investigation efforts identified historic and modern
cultural debris dating to the twentieth century
within the project area, as well as the remains of
multiple historic utilities. All deposits observed
were considered not significant. No evidence of
the Alazán Acequia was encountered during the
2014
monitoring investigations
and
no
archaeological sites were documented (Stotts et al.
2014).

Identified as potentially eligible for listing on the
NRHP (Dippel and Victor 2012), the Alazán
Acequia, has had two major archaeological
investigations conducted within its boundaries.
The first investigation was completed in 1977
when a small portion of the ditch was excavated at
San Pedro Park for the San Antonio Parks and
Recreation Department city park renovation and
landscaping project (Fox 1978). The 1977
investigations are located approximately 1.38
miles north-northeast of the current project area.
The investigations exposed portions of the Alazán
acequia constructed of repurposed cut limestone
blocks set atop a layer of weathered clay, a thin
layer of water-borne sand accumulation, and a
layer of gravelly soil. Bedrock forms the
foundation of the acequia. Two additional courses
of cut limestone were also added to the south wall
of the acequia and three were added to the north
wall during a second construction phase of the
acequia. Additionally, a coating of cement was
applied to the south wall additions which extends
down and over the bedrock foundation of the
feature. Late nineteenth century artifacts were
recovered from the brown loamy topsoil located
immediately above the acequia. It is likely these
artifacts date to the closing and filling of the
acequia. After the acequia was photographed and
documented, it was covered with soil matrix to
protect its remains from the proposed landscape
project (Fox 1978).

ALAZÁN ACEQUIA (41BX620)
The success of the mission acequias prompted late
nineteenth century San Antonio officials to
construct additional ditches to accommodate the
water demands of a growing population, and to
alleviate the Olmos Creek basin during flooding
episodes (Nickels and Cox 1996). In 1874,
engineers began construction on the Alazán
Acequia, which extends from the Upper Labor
Acequia near its beginning at San Pedro Springs,
and travels north-northwest for a distance of 0.75
13

for the San Antonio Water System VIA Transit-Westside Multimodal Transit Center Phase II Water Main Replacement Project

The second investigation of the Alazán Acequia
was conducted in 1996 approximately 0.86 mile
northeast of the current project area, when a
portion of the ditch was exposed during tunneling
excavations for a sewer line. The acequia was
found to be located approximately 7 to 14 feet
below the Union Pacific ROW, two blocks
northwest of the Five Points intersection. The
exposed ditch was found to be a unique tunnel
structure that measured 48 inches in diameter
within its interior. The tunnel was constructed of
36-inch by 18-inch hand-quarried keystone-shaped
limestone blocks. Most of the interior bottom and
sides of the acequia were coated with a threequarter inch layer of smooth roman cement. The
exterior of the tunnel was set within a mottled
clay, likely from construction backfill. The interior
of the tunnel was filled nearly to the top with silt
soils. No artifacts were found in association with
the tunnel (Nickels and Cox 1996).

Highway 35 (IH-35) that was designated a local
historic district in 1985 (SA-OHP website). The
buildings within the district include a variety of
late-nineteenthand
early-twentieth-century
commercial and industrial structures. The
Cattleman Square Historic District is roughly
bounded by Travis and Martin streets to the north,
Buena Vista and Commerce streets to the south,
IH-35 to the east, and the railroad tracks to the
west. In 1881, four years after the first rail line
was extended to San Antonio, the I&GNRR
opened its line from St. Louis to San Antonio. The
first I&GNRR depot was constructed shortly
thereafter at West Houston Street in what is today
within the historic district boundary. The
expansion of the railroad to this community led to
a flurry of real estate activity in the area, including
a mix of new residential, industrial, and
commercial buildings.
One of the most significant buildings within the
district is the former I&GNRR Passenger Station
at 123 N. Medina. The I&GNRR Passenger
Station, later known as the Missouri Pacific
Station, was designed in 1907 by architect Harvey
L. Page. The majestic building is of steel frame
construction in the plan of a Greek cross, with tan
brick cladding, a central dome, bell towers,
mission-style parapets, stained glass windows, and
barrel vaults on the interior. The lantern over the
dome features a bronze Indian figure. It is one of
two remaining railroad stations in San Antonio,
along with the Southern Pacific Depot or Sunset
Station on the city’s east side. The station was
built to replace the earlier wood-frame I&GNRR
depot constructed in the late nineteenth century on
West Houston Street. The railroad eventually
linked Austin to Laredo, providing a route into
Mexico. The depot closed in 1979 but has since
been restored and is the new VIA administrative
office.

Additional recent archaeological investigations
have also encountered the Alazán Acequia near
the current project area. The results of these
investigations are currently not available, but
verbal communication with the SA-OHP has
provided alternative routes for the Alazán Acequia
based on the draft reports of the investigations.
MAIN AND MILITARY PLAZAS NRHP HISTORIC
DISTRICT
The Main and Military Plaza Historic District is an
area in downtown San Antonio comprised of 13
whole blocks, the two plazas, and portions of two
additional blocks. The district includes 36
contributing structures, 24 compatible structures,
and an open green space (Main Plaza).
Contributing structures include the primarily
nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century two- and
three-story masonry structures, the eighteenthcentury Spanish Governor's Palace, nineteenthcentury City Hall, Bexar County Courthouse, and
San Fernando Cathedral (National Register
Nomination Form No. 79002914).

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
A review of 15 TxDOT historic overlay maps
from 1835 to 1953 determined that no historic-age
structures are within the project area (Foster et al.

intersecting the project area in two places on maps
from 1883 and 1889. While the 1883 map of San

development between it and the San Pedro Creek.
The 1953 Army Map Service topographic

project area. Likewise, the other 11 maps did not
contribute any information.

CONSTRUCTION MONITORING
SWCA conducted archaeological monitoring of
construction activity within the proposed
monitoring areas of the SAWS VIA project area
during various site visits between September 8–11,
17, 23–26, 29–30 and October 13–14, 2014
(Figure 5). Construction occurred on a total of 13
days within this period, contingent upon weather
and the proposed construction schedule. Overall,
the project area was found to be moderately
disturbed by previous construction activity and the
installation of multiple utilities. As the project area
is located in a heavily developed urban setting,
historic age utilities are a ubiquitous feature type
with little to no potential to contribute significant
information to the archaeological record. As such,
debris related to utility construction is considered
modern disturbance. The exception to this is the
historic acequia system. Evidence of the Alazán
Acequia was encountered along North Medina,
just south of its intersection with West Travis
Street. Construction activity was temporarily
halted and the feature was examined by the
assistant City Archaeologist, photographed, and
documented. However, no significant temporally
diagnostic artifacts, or significant items were
encountered.

Sanborn Fire Insurance maps from 1892, 1896,
1904, and 1911 that depict the project area were
consulted (Figure 4). The earliest map includes
North Medina Street, but only between West
Houston and Buena Vista Streets. Most of the
structures in this map front Commerce Street, and
include residences, saloons, restaurants, a laundry,
a bakery, and a large lumber yard (1892 Sanborn
Fire Insurance Map Sheet 2). The location of the
I&GNRR station is depicted as a rectangularshaped structure running north to south and
identified as I.&G.N.R.R. Freight Depot. By 1896,
the entire project area is depicted, including
Zavalla Street (West Travis Street). One 4-inch
water pipe is illustrated on the east side of the
North Medina Street ROW, and multiple Mexican
Dwellings front the south side of Zavalla Street.
Additional dwellings and shops front North
Medina and West Houston Streets (1896 Sanborn
Fire Insurance Map Sheets 3). The 1904 Sanborn
maps revealed an increase in commercial and
residential development, but an absence of any
utility lines within the city street ROWs (1904
Sanborn Fire Insurance Map Sheets 47 and 48).
Multiple 1911 Sanborn Maps also show consistent
development within the project area, including the
addition of an 8-inch water pipe at the intersection

NORTH MEDINA TRENCH
On September 8–11, 2014, monitored excavations
began on the North Medina Trench. Prior to
excavations, the asphalt blacktop and concrete
sidewalks of North Medina Street between West
Travis and West Houston Streets had been
removed for the replacement and/or installation of
multiple utility lines, man-hole vaults, fire
hydrants, and a storm water drainage system
(Figure 6). Although multiple construction
projects were in progress at the time of
monitoring, only excavations associated with the
proposed SAWS VIA project were monitored by
SWCA archaeologists.

Figure 6. North Medina Street with asphalt
removed, facing northwest.

Monitored excavations for the North Medina
Trench began adjacent to the I&GNRR parking lot
drive on the west side of the North Medina ROW.
The trench measured 3 feet (0.9 m) wide and was
excavated to 5 feet (1.5 m) deep (Figure 7). In
areas where existing utilities were encountered,
excavations ranged from 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 m)
in depth to allow the new water line to pass
beneath the obstacle (Figure 8). A total of 12
existing utilities were encountered during
excavations that varied in depths from 0 to 6 feet
(1.8 m) below surface. Utilities consisted of
concrete duct banks, polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
pipe, ceramic pipe, and iron pipe of various sizes.
Five connection trenches ranging from 3 to 5 feet
(0.9 to 1.5 m) in length were also excavated along
the North Median Trench for the replacement of
existing valve covers, meters, and fire hydrants
associated with the line (Figure 9). Monitored
excavations for the North Medina Trench
continued north for 360 feet (109.7 m) before
terminating in front of the Scobey Fireproof
Storage Company Building, where the new water
line was tied into an existing water line located 6
feet (1.8 m) below ground surface (Figure 10).

Soils consisted of very dark gray clays with 20
percent gravel inclusions in areas where the
asphalt blacktop had been removed (Figure 11).
Soils for the northern end of the North Medina
Trench consisted of the same very dark clay soils,
but with a 1-foot-thick (0.3-m) layer of asphalt and
gravelly, yellow construction base starting at
ground surface (Figure 12). Disturbed brown,
gray, and yellow mottled clays with a high volume
of gravels (40–60 percent) were observed in the
connection trenches excavated for the replacement
of existing valve covers, meters, and fire hydrants
associated with the line (Figure 13). Sporadic
fragments of red brick and modern construction
materials were also observed in the upper levels of
excavation throughout the trench, but no
uniformity was observed (Figure 14). All
documented construction materials were recorded
as construction fill or modern refuse.

Figure 9. Example of connection trenches for
valve cover replacements, facing north.

A light gray stratigraphic layer mixed with a
concentration of square cut-limestone blocks,
limestone cobbles, and red brick were observed on
the northern end of the North Medina Trench
(Figure 15). The light gray layer is located
approximately 15 feet (4.5 m) south of the
termination point of the trench and consists of a
light gray clay loam with 40 to 60 percent gravels
mixed with a light concentration of limestone
cobbles and gravels (Figure 16). The gray layer
begins 1 foot (0.3 m) below ground surface,
immediately below the asphalt and construction
base level and measures 1 foot thick by 10 feet
long. The gray level then transitions into a deposit
of disturbed dark gray clays with white/gray and
yellow mottled clay inclusions for the last 15 feet
of the North Medina Trench (Figure 17). The
disturbed layer also contains a concentration of red
brick fragments, limestone cobbles, and square
cut-limestone blocks that measured approximately
30 cm long, 30 cm wide, and 15 cm thick (Figure
18). No uniformity was observed in the
construction materials, which ranged from 1 to 6
(0.3 to 1.8 m) feet below ground surface.

fragments, no cultural materials were observed.
ALAZÁN ACEQUIA (41BX620)
A shallow, concave lens (Figures 19 and 20) was
observed within the North Medina Trench, 15 feet
(4 m) south of its intersection with West Travis
Street (see Figure 5). The basin-shaped feature
was observed in the east profile wall of the trench
and consisted of an unlined ditch filled with light
grayish brown clay loam mixed with 30 percent
gravels and pebbles (Figure 21). The profile is
underlain with very dark gray clay with 20 percent
gravels. Construction activity was temporarily
halted after the feature was identified by the
SWCA
archaeologist.
The
feature
was
documented and the assistant City Archaeologist
was contacted. The City Archaeologist
immediately arrived at the site and a quick
examination confirmed that the profile was the
remains of the Alazán Acequia.

Figure 18. Example of limestone cut block from
heavily disturbed deposits.
A review of the Sanborn maps does not illustrate
any structures or utilities in this location; however,
the nature of the materials indicate that the
remains of an unknown structure were used as
construction fill when the existing utility line was

Figure 23. West profile of trench near acequia
location, facing southwest.

The acequia begins just below a thin, 5 inch layer
of gravely, yellow construction base (asphalt
blacktop had been previously removed) and
extended to 2 feet (0.6 m) below surface at its
deepest point (Figure 22). The acequia measures
approximately 6 feet (1.8 m) wide; however, an
existing concrete utility duct bank has been
constructed into the northern quarter of the profile.
The acequia was not observed in the western
profile wall of the North Medina Trench (Figure
23). The projected angle of the acequia indicates
that the west profile was likely destroyed during
the installation of the concrete duct bank. No
cultural materials were observed within or

adjacent to the acequia profile. Because no cultural
materials or outstanding construction techniques
were observed, it was determined that the exposed
portion of the Alazán Acequia within the project
area is not significant. The eligibility of the larger
system of the acequia for designation as an SAL
has yet to be determined. While providing
important information on the general projection of
the acequia route, the portion of the acequia within
the project area lacks integrity and is not
recommended as a contributing component to the
SAL eligibility of the site.

SUMMARY OF NORTH MEDINA TRENCH
MONITORING
Overall, 360 feet of monitored excavations were
completed for the 650-foot North Medina Trench,
in addition to five connection trenches for existing
utility replacements. Excavations uncovered
moderately disturbed soils from previous
construction and the installation of 12 existing
utility lines. Evidence of the Alazán Acequia was
documented within the North Medina Trench, 15
feet south of its intersection with West Travis
Street. The unlined ditch was characterized by a 2foot-wide, 6-foot-long concave lens, filled with a
light gray, gravelly fill. The profile of the acequia
was only observed within the east profile wall of
the trench. The installation of a concrete duct bank
for an existing utility immediately north of the
acequia destroyed any evidence of the acequia
within the west wall of the trench. No cultural
materials were observed within or adjacent to the
acequia. Aside from the acequia, no other
significant cultural materials or features were
documented within the North Medina Trench.

Figure 24. Overview of West Houston Trench
location, facing east-southeast.

WEST HOUSTON TRENCH
On September 17–29, 2014, monitored
excavations began on the West Houston Trench.
The trench is located on the south side of the West
Houston Street ROW, between North Medina and
North Frio Streets (Figure 24). The trench
measured 3 feet wide (0.9 m), 350 feet (106 m)
long, and was excavated to 5 feet (1.5 m) on
average. The asphalt blacktop of West Houston
Street had been previously saw-cut for excavation.

Figure 25. Unmonitored excavations on east side
of the West Houston Trench, facing west.

Prior to monitored excavations, approximately 110
feet (33.5 m) of trench beginning at the
intersection of North Frio Street and West
Houston Street were excavated and set with the
new water main (Figure 25). This stretch of
excavation was not monitored for cultural
resources by SWCA archaeologists; however, a
20–30-foot (6–9-m) section of the previously
excavated trench was temporarily reopened to
allow an examination of the upper trench walls
(Figure 26). No cultural resources or features were
observed in the unmonitored portions of the West
Houston Trench.

Monitored excavations began to the west of where
unmonitored excavations left off (Figure 27). Soils
of the West Houston Trench consisted of 0 to 1
foot (0 to 0.3 m) of asphalt over gravely, yellow
construction base, followed by 1 to 5 feet of highly
disturbed, very dark gray clay mixed with yellow
and white/gray mottled clays and 20 to 40 percent
gravel inclusions (Figure 28). Highly disturbed
soils are the result of multiple existing utilities
throughout the West Houston Trench.
Five connection trenches that measured 6 feet long
north to south were also excavated, extending off
the south end of the West Houston Trench (Figure
29). The connection trenches were excavated to
replace the existing meter utilities associated with
the existing buildings along West Houston Street.
All soils of the connection trenches were highly
disturbed and consisted of a reddish-orange sand
fill used to mark existing utility lines (Figure 30).

Figure 27. Overview of monitored trenching
excavations, facing east.

A total of 18 existing utility lines were unearthed
during monitored excavations of West Houston
Trench (Figure 31). Utilities ranged from 1 to 6
feet below ground surface and consisted of PVC,
iron, and ceramic pipes that varied in size from 1
to 18 inches in diameter. Fifteen of the 18 existing
utilities intersected the trench, while the remaining
three were found to run, more-or-less, parallel to
the trench. One 18-inch ceramic pipe, located 3
feet below ground surface, was observed within
the south profile wall of the West Houston Trench
and spanned the entire length of the trench (Figure
32). The two remaining parallel utilities were only
observed on the west end of the trench and were
removed to accommodate the new water main.

Figure 28. Example of disturbed soils from West
Houston Trench excavations, facing north.

The profile of a red brick man-hole (Figure 33)
was observed within the south profile wall of the
West Houston Trench. The man-hole was
associated with the previously discussed ceramic
pipe that parallels the trench. The ceramic pipe
enters and exits the man-hole in an east to west
orientation, with an additional ceramic pipe that
extended north (seen in Figure 30). The northern
pipe extension of this junction was removed
during monitored excavations, as was a portion of
the brick man-hole to accommodate the new line.
Red brick man-holes are a common feature within
downtown San Antonio city streets and date to the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

SUMMARY OF WEST HOUSTON TRENCH
MONITORING

by SWCA archaeologists noted a mild depression
within the empty lot located 100 feet west of the
West Houston Street–North Frio Street
intersection (Figure 34). The empty lot contains
multiple debris piles of concrete and brick, as well
as one large oak tree. Although a definitive
assessment could not be made of the depression
(the empty lot is private property and fenced off to
the public), multiple projection routes illustrate the
acequia as passing though the empty lot. It is
possible that the mild depression observed during
field investigations is the settled remains of what
was once the Alazán Acequia.

Overall, no cultural materials or features were
observed during the monitored excavations of the
West Houston Trench. Excavations revealed
highly disturbed soils from the installation of 18
existing utility lines, including one 18-inch
ceramic pipe that parallels the entire length of the
trench. Although the Alazán Acequia was
projected to cross the eastern end of the West
Houston Trench, any evidence of it was obliterated
during the installation of existing utilities.
However, a general observation of the project area

WEST TRAVIS TRENCH

Prior to monitored excavations, approximately 220
feet (67 m) of trench, beginning at the intersection
of North Frio Street and West Travis Street, were
excavated and set with the new water main (Figure
36). This stretch of excavation was not monitored
for cultural resources by SWCA archaeologists.
Monitored excavations began to the west of where
unmonitored excavations left off. Soils of the West
Travis Trench consisted of 0 to 1 foot (0 to 0.3 m)
of asphalt over gravely, yellow construction base,
followed by 1 to 5 feet of highly disturbed, very
dark gray clay mixed with yellow and white/gray
mottled clays and 20 to 40 percent gravel
inclusions (Figure 37). The highly disturbed soils

On September 17–29 and October 13–14, 2014,
monitored excavations began on the West Travis
Trench (Figure 35). The trench is located on the
south side of the West Travis Street ROW,
between North Medina and North Frio Streets. The
trench measured 3 feet wide (0.9 m), 350 feet (106
m) long, and was excavated to 5 feet (1.5 m) on
average. The asphalt blacktop of West Travis
Street had been previously saw-cut for
excavations.

are the result of the installation of multiple
existing utilities throughout the trench.
Three additional connection trenches were
excavated for the West Houston Trench. Two 10foot (3-m) trenches (Figure 38) were excavated on
the south side of the main trench to replace the
existing valve covers for the new VIA TransitWestside Multimodal Transit Center. The two
trenches are parallel to each other near the medial
point of the West Travis trench and run on a
north–south orientation. An additional 40-foot (12m) trench was excavated on the north side of the
main trench, approximately 100 feet (30 m) to the
west of the intersection of West Travis Street and
North Medina Street (Figure 39). The trench was
excavated to connect the main line to the existing
building located on the north side of West Travis
Street. All soils of the connection trenches were
highly disturbed and consisted of dark gray clay
with yellow and white mottled clays and a reddishorange sand fill used to mark existing utility lines.

Figure 38. Two southern connection trenches for
the West Travis Trench excavations, facing
northwest.

A total of 12 existing utility lines were unearthed
during monitored excavations of the West Travis
Trench. Utilities ranged from 1 to 5 feet below
ground surface and consisted of PVC and iron
pipes that varied in size. One existing iron pipe ran
parallel down the center of the excavated trench
and was removed to accommodate the new water
main. Two additional existing lines also paralleled
the excavated trench near the intersection of the
northern connection trench, which caused the
walls of the trench to consistently collapse
throughout excavations (Figure 40). Shoring plates
were used to help stabilize the trench walls.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

cultural materials or outstanding construction
techniques were observed, SWCA determined that
the exposed portion of the Alazán Acequia within
the project area is not significant. However, the
specific location of the acequia within the SAWS
VIA project area is considered valuable as it
contributes important information regarding the
location and trajectory of the Alazán Acequia as a
whole.

On behalf of Medina Consulting Company and
SAWS, SWCA conducted cultural resources
monitoring of an underground water main
replacement project in support of the SAWS VIA
Transit-Westside Multimodal Transit Center,
Phase II Project. The work involved replacing and
installing a 12-inch and 8-inch water main entirely
contained within the existing ROW of North
Medina, West Travis, and West Houston Streets.

All work within the construction monitoring area
was conducted within moderately disturbed
deposits predominantly dating to the early to midtwentieth century. SWCA made a reasonable and
good faith effort to identify historic properties
within the project area. Based on the results of the
monitoring efforts, the excavation within the
monitored portion of the SAWS VIA encountered
a segment of the Alazán Acequia. Although the
eligibility of the larger Alazan Acequia system for
designation as a SAL has yet to be determined, the
narrow portion within the project area is not a
significant contributing component.
Existing
disturbances and lack of significant structural or
cultural materials have jeopardized the section’s
potential to yield new or important information
regarding the acequia. In addition, no significant
cultural materials or additional cultural features
were identified within the project area. As such,
no further work is recommended for the SAWS
VIA Project.

The work performed by SWCA included an indepth historical and archival records review
followed
by
archaeological
construction
monitoring in an effort to identify, record, and
characterize any extant historic resources or
deposits within the project area. The focus of the
study was the mapped location of the Alazán
Acequia, constructed in 1874.
SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was
performed during construction activities that
occurred between September 8–11, 17, 23–26, 29–
30 and October 13–14, 2014. The goal of the work
was to examine and assess any cultural deposits
revealed in the construction, adequately document
the cultural resources, and provide sufficient
information to make determinations on age and
significance. All work was done in accordance
with the standards and guidelines of the THC and
the CTA.
The construction monitoring identified moderately
disturbed soils mixed with construction materials
(e.g., red brick fragments, concrete fragments,
limestone cut blocks, etc.) dating to the early to
mid-twentieth century, primarily related to
previous construction activity and utilities.
Evidence of the Alazán Acequia was documented
within the North Medina Trench, 15 feet south of
its intersection with West Travis Street. The
unlined ditch was characterized by concave lens,
filled with a light gray, gravelly fill. The profile of
the acequia was only observed within the east
profile wall of the trench. The installation of a
concrete duct bank for an existing utility
immediately north of the acequia has destroyed
any evidence of the acequia within the west wall
of the trench. No cultural materials were observed
within or adjacent to the acequia. Because no
