A BURIAL IN McCURTAIN COUNTY,
OKLAHOMA
SHERMAN

P.

LAWTON

The Ward's Lake site, Mc-24, is located in McCurtain
County on the old channel of Norwood Creek.
Surface village debris, scattered along about 500 feet of
slo! ing bank, proved puzzling, so three test pits were made,
two of them 5 feet square and the third 10 by 10 feet.
The dirt is disturbed by plowing to a depth of 6 to 8 inches.
Twenty-four inches below the surface is a layer of sandy
clay, in which nothing was found that suggested human
occupation. This left only the comparatively shallow area
between the plow-line and the clay foundation in which
useful materials might be found. Underground material
was sparse, so records were kept only of one-foot levels.
The first foot below the surface was designated as Level
1, and the second foot as Level 2.
In Pit 1 nothing was found except some flint chips in
Level 1.
In Pit 2, flint chips were distributed down through Level
2, but were more numerous in Level 1 by a ratio of three to
one. A substantial number of pieces of charcoal and burned
clay were found in Pit 2, with Level 1 outnumbering Level 2
by a ratio of about two to one. Some clay pieces strongly
suggest wattle plaster, although no definite impressions of
sticks are present, and the clay does not contain grass or reed
fibres. Similar clay pieces extend into Level 2 in about
equal proportion to Level 1. Consequently, the possibilit~
of a house site was examined carefully. Two potential postholes were finally eliminated as root cavities or animal burrows. Flint chips, a flake knife, one potsherd and an incomplete scraper were also found in Pit 2, Level 2.
In Pit 3 were found an extended burial, two complete
arrowheads (one in each level), a broken arrowhead, a
broken pendant, a flake-knife, numerous flint chips, some

186

"wattle-like" clay, charcoal and 30 potsherds, four of them
in Level2.

BURIAL
This proved to be the burial of a man, about 5 feet 8 inches
in height, probably in his late thirties1. The burial was on
the back, with the right shoulder slightly higher than the
left, suggesting that the grave had not been made quite wide
enough. The excavation had also been made too short to
accomodate the length of the body, so the head was upright.
The grave had been dug exactly to the point that digging
became more difficult, where the clay foundation began
(Fig. 17, A).
The bones were in a state of extreme disintegration, and
it was possible to trace the entire outline only by following calcium flecks. One portion of the right femur and
one portion of the left tibia were completely missing, possibly the result of rodents. The remaining bone fragments,
which still held some shape, had to be protected during
transportation and hardened before they could be handled.
Portions of the left humerus both radii, and both tibias and
femurs were obtained.
The skull is the most interesting feature of this burial.
The occipital portion is artificially flattened. The forehead
slopes sharply backward, beginning immediately above the
eye-sockets. This supraorbital slope does not appear to be
artificial. The whole frontal portion of the face below the
nose is set forward of a line parallel to the forehead, resulting
in marked prognathism. The mandible is dropped slightly
and offset a bit to the left. Despite this difficulty, it seems
clear that the ape-like appearance of the face is fundamental
and not due to the dropping and off-setting of the jaw. The
four remaining teeth are worn flat . The skull is dolichocephalic mongoloid.
1. Classification by Dr. Alice Brues, University of Oklahoma
School of Medicine. Gratitude is hereby expressed to Dr. Brues
for her diagnosis of the skull; to Dr. Douglas Schwartz and Dr. and
Mrs. Stephen Borhegyi for advice; and to Dr. Robert E. Bell for
general editing.

The slant of the forehead and general shape of the head
are highly suggestive of the San Simon skulls, which were
dominant among a non-pueblo group in the southwest from
3000 B.C. to 500 B.C. A similar skull has been found in
Texas and several in Nebraska (Brues, 1946, esp. p. 22).
There is a likeness to the so-called "Loess Man" of Nebraska.

There were no evident burial associations. The head was
oriented directly east.
Some black organic material, obtained from the area
where calcium flecks indicated toes, remains unidentified.
POTTERY
Sherds were very sparse, both on the surface and in the
earth. Only three sherds were found on the entire surface
of the site, although erosion was marked in many places.
In 200 cubic feet of dirt from Pit 3, only 30 sherds were
recovered on a quarter-inch screen.
Of these, four were on the lower level, and one might
be classed as a chunk of baked and shaped clay rather than a
definite potsherd.
The descriptions of the sherds recovered are given in
Table 1.

The four pieces from the lower level all have a coarse,
pitted, weathered appearance. One roughly incised sherd
is clay or sherd-tempered (Fig. 17, B) . Its design is not
unknown in Fourche Maline, Nelson and Bryan foci, and
perhaps others.
Another has a raised scollop on a slightly round rim. This
does not appear to have been applied, but was probably
achieved by pressing down the surface (Fig 17, C).
Four thin, black, polished sherds from the upper level
show diagonal, eccentric, and parallel lines as well as suggestions of concentric circles (Fig. 17, D-G) .
Two light brown, smooth, medium-thick sherds from the
upper level show greater simplicity, one having a suggestion of brushed surface (Fig. 17, H), the other having
irregularly spaced diagonal incisions (Fig. 17, I) .
Other interesting features include a medium-thick, light
brown, polished sherd with a bevel; a small, rounded sherd
with red slip which could be a pipe stem or a strap handle
fragment ; and a medium-thick, r ough-textured piece with
light red slip and thumb impressions.
PROJECTILE POINTS
Only two complete arrow points were found in Pit 3, one
on each level. They are both relatively wide and squarestemmed. Where a road-digger cut through the same area
at Red Hill, a half mile from the site, three points washed
out of the side. Two of them are almost identical with those
taken from the burial pit. A total of 86 points was recovered
from the surface and from eroded areas.

190

Texas Archeological Society

The square-stemmed form mentioned above was the second
most common point found on the surface. The most common was an unnotched form 1¥2 to 2'12 inches long and 1 to
1¥2 inches wide, with a contracting stem and rounded base.
One point shows an intentionally made torque, another a
bevel, and a third shows a rough serration. A point of
white chert had apparently been made long enough ago to
acquire a coating of iron oxide, giving it a superficial appearance of jasper.
OTHER LITHIC MATERIALS
From Pit 3, in which the burial occurred, but not associated
with it, were a brown scraper and flake knife. A relatively
large white flint flake, apparently not a knife or scraper,
was between the lower legs of the burial and a small white
flint flake was removed from the right eye socket area.
A list of materials from the site includes (measurements
in inches):
Hoe blade: 5lh by 2%, with torque, opalesque. (Another blade,
similar in size and shape, is owned by a neighborhood boy.)
Knives: 1 flake knife from Pit 2; 1 flake knife from Pit 3; 1
black elliptical, 3% by Ph; 1 jasper, 1lh by 1; 1 white flint,
slightly crescent in shape, 4¥2 by 1%; 1 brownish chert, 1%
bylh; 1 thin flint flake, roughly triangular, 2 by 2, with
secondary chipping.
Scrapers: 1 incomplete from Pit 2; 1 brown chert, 2% by 1% by
!3/4, from Pit 3; 1 brown, 3 by %; 1 black flint, thick, 2% by
1%; 1 triangular white chert, 1¥2 by 1; one broken opalesque
scraper or drill from lower level of Pit 3.
1 chert drill, narrow, triangular, convex sides and base,
1% by %.
One broken black flint polisher from the first level of Pit 3;
one broken black hornfeld polisher from the lower level of
Pit 3.
One broken ovaloid slate pendant, with two holes drilled on
each end, and some unexplained, irregularly spaced grooves
cut in one side.
One four-sided milling stone, 9 by 8lh, with a rounded grinding
area. (An elliptical sandstone milling stone from a nearby
field also has a rounded basin.)
One broken, rounded, tapering end, apparently from a celt; one
broken, beautifully polished granite celt, 2% inches wide,
with a chisel end.
Three round manos.
Hammerstones, broken points, rubbing stones.

COMMENTS
Obviously, with so few sherds and so little material from
the excavations, no real conclusions can be drawn about the
Ward's Lake site at the present time.
One complication rests in the fact that an historic Choctaw
settlement was located on the same eminence, one-half mile
to the east. A road-digger unearthed a burial about three
feet deep, of a woman, together with a celluloid comb, glass
beads and an 1859 half-dime. This gave rise to the speculation that the Ward's Lake site might be historic Choctaw.
However, the black, thin, incised pottery found at Ward's
Lake in the first level is not historic Choctaw ware. It
could fit equally well into several prehistoric horizons, and
would have been at home at Spiro. The sherds from the
lower level are also not related to any historic group. There
are no European contact materials at this site.
The burial also showed distinctly prehistoric characteristics, and the condition of the bones suggests a markedly
greater antiquity than those of the Choctaw woman. The
skull type is rare, and is not found commonly among historic
groups though it is related to the Yaqui and sometimes
crops up among the Sioux.
The mixture of materials suggests either that the site was
occupied by several different groups at different times or
that this site should be considered in a separate classification
from those now commonly used.
For example, the two dominant shapes of projectile points
are the two commonly ascribed to the McCurtain focus (Bell
and Baerreis, 1951, pp. 53-61) and some of the pottery is
similar to that complex. But none of the other usual McCurtain characteristics are present. An abundance of sherds,
the pear-shaped hornfeld hoes, the burial furniture, and the
low domiciliary mounds which seem common to McCu rtain
sites are missing. Furthermore, McCurtain milling stones
commonly have elliptical basins.

194

Texas Archeological Society

The oval pendant, the celts and some of the pottery suggest the Fourche Maline focus. But the abundant shells and
bone artifacts usually found at Fourche Maline sites are
absent at Ward's Lake. The projectile points, especially the
large ones, are like Fourche Maline in shape, but are too well
made and have too few quartzite pieces to fit that classification neatly. Typical Fourche Maline burials are flexed
and have no grave offerings.
It is, perhaps, safe only to say that the Ward's Lake site
is, at present, puzzling, and further information is needed.
Since it is planned that a dairy barn and house will be constructed on this site very soon, it is not likely that further
information will be forthcoming.
