ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Any cultural resources investigation owes its success to a number of
persons. Abel Solis, the San Ygnacio Water Superintendent, and his staff
provided invaluable assistance in locating pipes, obtaining landowner permission,
and in many other endeavors. Zapata County employees (particularly Precinct 2
Commissioner, Gabriel Villarreal) provided information and labor during some
phases of the project. The field crew consisted of Art Romine, Bobby Jemison,
and Wayne Wernli. The engineers at Garcia and Wright Consulting Engineers of
San Antonio (Gilberto Gonzalez, Raul Garcia, and Elliot Poduska) also provided
assistance during all phases of the project. Ms. Terri Myers provided architectural
and historical data.

ABSTRACT
During January and February of 2009, Archaeological Consultants, Inc.
carried out a series of cultural resources assessments and monitoring activities
within the town of San Ygnacio, Texas in Zapata County. Seventy-one areas
adjacent to intact banquetas were tested to discover if footings or other cultural
features in the vicinity would be endangered by construction activities, and only
one area was discovered that might be affected. The investigations also
documented the extent of disturbance in these areas and collected a limited
number of artifacts that also aided in clarification of the existing conditions.
Eighteen backhoe trenches were excavated, and two cut bank profiles
were examined. These areas provided investigators not only the chance to
assess subsurface sediments and conditions but also the opportunity to discover
additional buried cultural features. The backhoe excavations were supplemented
by an additional seventy-seven power pole placements allowing even further
observation of subsurface conditions. Only one feature (BF-1) was discovered.
This is a disassociated accumulation of fire-cracked rock and lithic debris at
Backhoe Trench 2. The investigators were able to examine subsurface
conditions to depths of at least eleven feet and identify the presence of a
remarkably homogeneous, albeit disturbed, stratum present throughout the
sampled area.
While the archaeological investigations at San Ygnacio did not provide a
great deal of new or crucial data, they suggest that the drainage improvement
project is unlikely to adversely affect currently known cultural resources. The
continued monitoring should ensure that adverese effects continue to be
avoided. The collected data does support the importance of the San Ygnacio
Historic district and clarifies both the degree of disturbance already present and
the potential for additional finds.

INTRODUCTION
Archaeology Consultants, Inc. conducted monitoring and assessment of a
storm water improvement project within the city of San Ygnacio, Texas in Zapata
County (Figure 1). Given its location adjacent to an international boundary and
the presence of National Register of Historic Places properties, this project may
be covered under any or all of the procedures defined under the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-665), as amended; the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (P.L. 91-190); Executive Order 11593, "Protection and
Enhancement of the Cultural Environment", 13 May 1971 (36 CFR Part 800);
Preservation of Historic and Archaeological Data, 1974 (P.L. 98-291, as
amended; and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, "Procedures for
Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties" (36 CFR Part 800). It is also
covered by the Texas Antiquities Code.
Description of Project Area
San Ygnacio is located in west-central Zapata County and is directly
adjacent to the Rio Grande River. The town is situated on the east bank
(ascending) of the river and is about 14 miles upriver from the town of Zapata.
The storm water improvements plan requires the implacement of a series of
drainage pipes to be placed beneath the existing streets, the removal of the
present paving and underlayment (base material), as well as extensive trenching.
Since many of these streets and their surroundings are located in their original
19th century positions, monitoring and assessment are required to mitigate any
adverse effects on historic structures or cultural features. The project area is
depicted on the USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangle San Ygnacio (2799-122)
(Figure 2).

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
The Prinicipal Investigtor examined the records and maps at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory on the campus of The University of Texas at
Austin, the Dolph Briscoe Center in Austin, the Zapata County Courthouse, the
library at the University of Texas at Bownsville/Texas Southmost College, and
the South Texas reference collection at the University of Texas-Pan American.
The archival research revealed that one cultural resources survey had
been conducted in the town of San Ygnacio. James E. Warren (1992) monitored
the installation of underground utilities for the City of San Ygnacio. These
investigations resulted in the discovery of several cultural features including a
grave containing a Native American, and suggested that additional monitoring
would be necessary within the San Ygnacio historic district when the storm water
improvements will be installed.
Previous archaeological investigations in Zapata County have focused
mainly on surveys and limited testing projects associated with the construction
and maintenance of Falcon Reservoir (Krieger and Hughes 1950; Paull and
Zaveleta 1980; Kotter 1980; Warren 1989a, 1989b; and Keller and Neil 2002).
These investigations have added significantly to our understanding of prehistoric
and historic settlement patterns, but they have not generally been associated
with detailed lifeway reconstructions or theory building.

CULTURAL CHRONOLGY
The culture history of the Rio Grande Plain (Black 1989), especially its
prehistoric component, is not particularly well understood. In large measure, this
circumstance is due to a basic lack of data (Prewitt 1974). Archaeological sites
have been recorded and, some have been investigated. almost without
exception, these sites are heavily disturbed open surface sites and lithic scatters.
According to Black (1989), cemeteries in the Lower Rio Grande Delta have
provided limited data.
Prehistoric populations are believed to have been the predecessors of the
Cohuiltecan groups encountered by the first European explorers. They are
believed to have practiced a nomadic hunting and gathering way of life that
stressed mobility and the exploitation of fish, shellfish and plant products.
Presumably, this way of life had been practiced from the time of the earliest
occupations with only slight alterations occurring when technological innovations
such as the bow and arrow and ceramics were available.
In the immediate project area, the standard cultural chronology of PaleoIndian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric been applied with some modifications and
emphases (Black 1989). There is simply too little data to expand much beyond
these basic attempts to order the prehistoric developments. In large measure,
this is due to the fragile and disturbed nature of the known cultural resources and
the massive data losses that have and continue to occur. The best chances to
rectify this situation are believed to exist in deeply buried terrace occupations
along the Rio Grande and other streams. Nevertheless, as Black (1989) notes
such sites appear to be uncommon and are difficult to appreciate from surface
indications.
The longlasting nature of the basic hunter-and-gatherer lifestyle can easily
be discerned from the fact that populations encountered by the first European
explorers and observers were nomadic hunters-and-gatherers (Salinas 1990).
The records of the first Spanish explorer (Alonso Alvarez de Pineda) suggest as
many as forty brush arbor settlements (ramadas) or rancherias were present
along the first sixteen miles of the Rio Grande river channel (Salinas 1990:22) in
1519. Other documents suggest that the Rio Grande delta was the most densely
populated area of northeastern Mexico and Southern Texas (Salinas 1990:139)
because of the greater subsistence resources available in the area. The project
area is within the periphery of this area of higher population density. However,
given the limited data presently available, almost any prehistoric site would add
greatly to our data base and predictive capability.

5

The historic period, beginning with the first explorations of Pineda, is
better understood. Nevertheless, there has been comparatively little work done
with historic materials despite the fact that some of the settlements established
by Escandon (1946) on the Rio Grande River are among the earliest in what is
now the United States. These settlements are generally associated with the
course of the Rio Grande River, and are all located well south of the project
area. As a result, the project area may have been controlled by populations in
these settlements, but it appears to have been utilized only in a sporadic and low
impact fashion (Kelly 1985).
The city of Laredo was esablished 1755 on the best ford across the Rio
Grande. It served as entreport, way station, and cultural center along the El
Camino del Rey to San Antonio and the northern hinterlands. Laredo became an
important location during the initial Spanish colonization, mission building
periods, and continued in that role after Mexican independence and the
establishment of the Republic of Texas.
The City of San Ygnacio was established about the same time as Laredo,
as ranching families began to exploit the vast holdings provided by the Spanish
Crown. Between 1750 and 1767 (for example) Don Jose Vasquez Borrego and
his wife Josefa Imperial were granted about 350,000 acres in the San Ygnacio
area and established their headquarters at Rancho Dolores a few miles north of
the present town of San Ygnacio (Fish 1989:2-4). The site of San Ygnacio itself
was purchased from the heirs of the Vasquez Borrego in 1830 by Don Jesus
Trevino. He established his ranch headquarters (Trevino Fort) on the present
site of San Ygnacio, and the town developed as a ranching support community
with both domestic and commercial buildings. Today, the town remains as one of
the best preserved examples of architecture in Texas that dates to the Spanish
Colonial and early Mexican Republic periods.
During the American Civil War this part of Texas was the scene of
intermittent skirmishes by combatants representing the United States, the
Confederacy, the Mexican Republic, and Emperor Maximillian. After the Civil
War, the project area continued to be relatively undeveloped. Land use was
dominated by open range, cattle production, and later oil and gas development.
Laredo continued to dominate the region in an economic sense throughout the
20th century and is currently one of the major centers of trade between the United
States and Latin America.

SCOPE-OF-WORK
Given the character and quality of the historic structures located in San
Ygnacio, the scope of the potential disturbance factors, the likelyhood that
undiscovered but significant cultural resources might exist, and the need to
mitigate any adverse impact a Memorandum of Understanding (hereafter
referred to as the Memorandum) was necessary to regulate project construction
procedures and archaeological assessments. The International Boundary and
Water Commission (lead agency), the Texas Historical Commission, and Zapata
County agreed to the implementation of this Memorandum in October of 2008.
This Memorandum also required an extensive Scope-of-Work that governs the
monitoring operations.
The archaeological testing program utilized backhoe trenching in affected
blocks and the excavation of hand dug shovel tests in the vicinity of those
banquetas that were identified as potentially endangered by the curb and gutter
project. Architectural Historian Terri Myers examined the project area and
identified areas of special concern. She also provided the archaeologists and
engineers with preservation guidelines, but she did not define the archaeological
procedures or their implementation.
The backhoe testing program utilized mechanically dug trenches in each
block affected by the storm sewer project. The trenches were dug to the
proposed depth of Area of Potential Effect, and a profile drawing of each trench
was drawn and recorded. Approximately 20 shovels full of excavated matrix from
each 30 centimeter level were screened, and artifacts (when present) were
collected. These trenches were supplemented by visual observations made while
monitoring the emplacement of utility poles. A backhoe trench log can be found
in Appendix I, and the location of the backhoe trenches are depicted in Figure 3.
The proposed placement of the utility poles is depicted in Figure 3.
An additional phase of the testing program focused on examination of the
stone banquetas associated with houses and identifying the the existence of
subsurface banqueta extensions. These locations were tested by handexcavated shovel tests adjacent to the banquetas. The size of each shovel test
was 30 cm x 50 cm, and they were dug in 20 centimeter levels to the bottom of
the banqueta. All recovered matrix was screened and all associated artifacts
were collected. Detailed records, including scale drawings of the banqueta face,
were kept for each shovel test. A shovel test log can be found in Appendix IV,
and the shovel tests are plotted on a map (Figure 3).

Special provisions for data recovery operations were also made to
determine the course of action should significant cultural resources be
encountered. These provisions provided for consultation with the Texas Historical
Commission, excavation, and documentation as necessary. Burials would
require additional documentation and recording procedures and would not be
disturbed prior to consultation with the Texas Historical Commission and affected
Native American groups.

SHOVEL TESTING AT BANQUETAS
Banquetas are essentially raised stone paved sidewalks. In Mexican
Spanish, the term banqueta means sidewalk. Although banquetas provide
relatively level walkways, they were designed to facilitate drainage of rainwater
away from the vulnerable foundations of buildings. This helps to ensure the
stability of the sandstone buildings present in the San Ygnacio historic district.
They are constructed by excavating a narrow trench at a short distance from the
building foundation and then inserting a relatively flat sandstone block or paver
into the trench as a vertical member. Fill is then built up between the foundation,
and this vertical member and the resulting surface are paved over with flattened
sandstone flagstones. These âsidewalksâ originally paralleled the narrow streets
that were constructed between the buildings. Photographs of 19 th century and
modern banquetas are found in Appendix VI.
The primary purpose of the banqueta testing program was to determine
whether footings or other features extended into the street where they might be
affected by the curb and gutter project. As a result, testing procedures involved
excavation of a single shovel test directly adjacent to the vertical member and
between it and the street. Thus, the vertical member formed one side of the
shovel test. The shovel test was excavated in arbitrary levels of ten centimeters
(3.937 inches), and the soil and other debris was screened using Â¼ inch mesh.
Shovel tests were terminated when they reached approximately one level below
the bottom of the vertical member. This procedure ensured that excavation
examined the entire depth of the banqueta and collected any associated artifacts.
In some cases, the original banquetas had been supplemented or even
supplanted by concrete sidewalks. In these instances, the same procedures were
followed except that the shovel tests were excavated in a position directly
adjacent to the concrete footing. If the concrete footing had been laid directly
atop the banqueta, as was often the case, the excavation could proceed in the
normal fashion to the base of the original banqueta. However, in some cases the
original banqueta had been removed. In such instances, excavation was not
terminated until it could be determined that the banqueta had been removed. The
depth of the base and type of materials used (caliche or gravel) were recorded at
each area, and a profile was drawn.
Altogether, seventy-one shovel tests were dug adjacent to banquetas or
banqueta-like features. Thirty-seven of these features were made of sandstone
while five of them were a combination of sandstone and Portland concrete. It is
suspected that the sandstone portions of the features are historic elements.
Twenty-seven banquetas revealed only concrete on their surfaces and are
suspected to be modern elements. Six shovel tests failed to reveal banquetas
beneath the surface and one planned shovel test had to be deleted because of
the presence of a concrete street gutter.

10

Only shovel tests 1 and 8 encountered a buried banqueta footing
extending toward the street. Both of these tests were on the same side of the
street and were associated with the same building at 405 Houston. As a result, it
appears that the same feature was present in both of these tests.
Otherwise, the banqueta excavation reflected a long pattern of road
resurfacing and modification. Almost invariably, a relatively thick layer of road fill
formed the surface of each shovel test. In some cases, this fill was rather loosely
packed and even supported a sparse growth of grass or weeds. In most cases,
however, the paved surface of road actually abutted the vertical banqueta
member. This paving will have to be removed before the excavation can
proceed. In all cases, the road gravel deposit was disturbed and typically
consisted of unconsolidated gravels and small river cobbles. When present,
artifacts frequently included modern items.
In all cases these roadfill deposits overlay the natural silt loam on which
San Ygnacio is built. This silt loam was apparently deposited by the river, and it
is remarkably homogeneous with little variation in coloration, hue, or texture. In
some cases, the roadfill deposits appeared to rest directly on this silt loam. In
other instances, roadfill materials have been gradually incorporated into the silt
loam. In its upper reaches, this silt loam is frequently disturbed and this
disturbance generally appears to extend below the depth of the banqueta trench.
It appears that this disturbance includes both natural and mechanical elements.
For example, in some instances it was apparent that the vertical banqueta
members were dislodged and dragged along the face of the newly graded
surface at some time in the past before being redeposited. This was noted in
shovel tests 18, 46, 62, and 71. It is likely that the dismembered banqueta on the
west side of the Trevino Fort is the result of this sort of construction related
disturbance.
Evidence from the banqueta shovel tests and backhoe trenches suggests
that at least three episodes of road construction and/or paving have taken place.
Originally, the streets were of unimproved dirt. Later, they were covered with a
combination of crushed caliche and chert gravels. Still later and apparently in
preparation for asphalt paving, a layer of compacted caliche was added as base
material. A second layer of asphalt was then installed over the first layer. It is
not known when the concrete curbs and aprons were installed, but these
probably represent comparatively recent additions.

11

Artifacts recovered included a metal cartridge case (.22 caliber), a ceramic
button, nails, and modern debris such as plastic items, aluminium pop-tops,
modern whitewares and bottle glass. Beer and other bottle glass is a common
component and probably reflects the presence of so much hardscape (i.e. curbs,
banquetas, and narrow paved streets) in relatively restricted areas. One would
be hard pressed not to encounter broken bottle fragments adjacent to any
banqueta. However, there was only one possible Spanish Colonial artifact and
only limited numbers of potential 19th century items present in the shovel tests.
The recovered items all derive from seemingly mixed deposits and their very
presence bears testimony to the nature of the disturbance.
The historic banquetas represent a unique cultural resource but one that
would be very easy to damage. They are particularly vulnerable to mechanical
disturbance and other operations that subject them to increased rainwater
infiltration and erosion. For this reason, there appears to be only a very limited
rationale for leaving a twenty-four inch gap between the banquetas and the new
curb and gutters. Such activities can not only restrict traffic movement along the
already narrow streets, but they will also impede drainage and may actually force
water back onto the existing banquetas. This, in our view, would do nothing more
than defeat the original purpose of the remaining banquetas and further hamper
preservation efforts. Futhermore, such a procedure would expose the banquetas
to severe distubance as the current and already installed concrete aprons are
removed. Erosion and spalling of the vertical sandstone banqueta members
would almost certainly result.

12

BACKHOE TRENCHING AND PROFILE RECORDING
Eighteen backhoe trenches were excavated during this phase of the
project, and the resultant profiles were drawn and recorded as specified in the
Scope-of-Work. Two additional cutbank profiles were also recorded. The
backhoe trenching project was concentrated on sampling areas east of the
Historic district, plaza and where the storm drains are planned. In most cases,
the backhoe was used not only to excavate trenches to the depth of the planned
pipe placement but also to remove a section of paving and road fill. While most
of the asphalt paving at San Ygnacio seldom exceeds four inches (10.2
centimeters), there are some locations where it is noticeably thicker. For
example, the paving is nearly nine inches thick at Backhoe Trench 11.
The data collected during this phase of the project was remarkably similar.
As a result, there is little variation in the observed strata. Below the paving and
the associated underlayment is the same 10YR 6/4 silt loam encountered during
the banqueta testing and observed during the excavation for electrical pole
placement. This ubiquitous stratum appears in all backhoe trench locations and
is remarkably homogeneous from top to bottom. As might be expected, the
lower portions of this stratum are slightly more moist than its upper sections. In
some locations the very lowest portions of this silt loam stratum appear to contain
slightly larger amounts of clay, and this results in a textural difference or a
difference in âfeelâ that occurs within the lower portions of this stratum. However,
this âfeelâ is extremely subtle and is not reflected in hue or coloration. In addition,
the increased amount of clay is perhaps more apparent than real as clay never
makes up more than 10% of these lower deposits. We suspect that this subtle
difference reflects leaching and transportation of clay particles into the lower
areas by water in these well drained sediments.
As noted previously, there seem to be at least three episodes of street
paving at San Ygnacio. The original dirt streets were apparently first covered
with crushed caliche and a base composed of river cobbles. In some cases, this
has been incorporated into the upper layers of the underlying silt loam and tightly
compacted. Later, a subsequent layer of compacted caliche was added las base
to support the asphalt. In some locations, fill was added to produce a level
surface and repair potholes. There are at least two layers of asphalt paving as
well as numerous hot and cold mix patches.
The only evidence of a buried feature was a loose scatter of fire-cracked
rock and lithic debris in an excavation unit adjacent to Backhoe Trench 2 (Figure
4). Even here, however, there was no discrete or readily definable evidence of
cultural activity within the exposed sediments. This location had no particular
limits or dicernable configuration, but was merely a concentration of cultural
materials within a relatively restricted area.

13

Figure 4. Backhoe Trench 2 (North Profile)
When a possible feature (BF-1) was observed in the floor of Backhoe
Trench 2 at a depth of 90 centimeters, this trench was terminated. Excavation
Unit 1 (1 x 2 meters in size) was dug by hand adjacent to the southern edge of
the backhoe trench and adjacent to the suspected feature. The unit was dug in
arbitrary levels of 20 centimeters in order to determine the presence of an intact
feature. This unit was excavated to 180 centimeters, and no intact feature was
found. Table 1 depicts each level and what was found. The only artifacts
observed consisted of scattered chert knapping debris and a few mussel shell
fragments at 100-140 centimeters. It seems possible that this feature was never
anything more than an accumulation of cultural debris that was noted during
backhoe trenching. If it had ever been an actual feature, it was probably
disturbed by ancient flooding episodes of the nearby Rio Grande River when the
present soil was being laid down. We suggest that there is indeed a feature,
albeit a scattered and ill-defined one, in this vicinity but that itâs importance is
muted. The accumulated data suggest only that such features may be
encountered, and this was hardly unexpected. As in much of deep South Texas,
the prehistoric cultural features reflect the mobile lifestyle of the inhabitants and
the ephemeral nature of their occupations. In a well drained, disturbed, and
bioturbated location like the Rio Grande floodplain at San Ygnacio, the survival of
this kind of feature can be considered problematic at best.

The artifacts recovered from the backhoe trenches included beer bottle
glass (n=10), clear glass (n=2), a whiteware sherd, porcelain sherds (n=2), one
piece of freshwater mussel shell, a bone fragment, a plaster fragment, and 108
pieces of chipped stone. Given the greater depth to which the backhoe trenches
were excavated and the nature of the sediments, the presence of relatively large
numbers of chipped stone materials is not surprising. It should also be noted that
the majority of the chipped stone was collected from two backhoe trenches 1 and
2 that are near each other. Most of these chipped stone items (n=71) were from
the possible feature in Backhoe Tench 2. At Backhoe Trench 1, twenty-eight
chipped chert items were also recovered. The distance between the two
trenches is less than 100 feet.

15

MONITORING
Monitoring of Pole Placement
Excavation for the erection of new electrical utility poles took place during
the banqueta and backhoe testing programs. This proved beneficial to the
archaeological survey since it was relatively easy to incorporate observations
made during these non-archaeological excavations into the archaeological
database. Excavation for the utility poles involved power augering or hand
excavation and the American Energy & Power Company crews allowed
archaeologists to carefully monitor the excavation process and halted operations
when the archaeologists needed to collect data. Seventy-seven of these pole
replacements were inspected (Appendix III). The holes for the utility poles were
12 to 15 inches in diameter, and they did not provide the best profiles nor did
they allow direct observation of the colors, hues, and textures of underlying
sediments to a depth of nearly seven feet (2.16 meters). While no cultural
features were encountered by the utility pole excavations, the observations and
the data collected helped supplement the backhoe trench data by providing some
different data collection locations, including some within the historic district.
Monitoring of Utility Trenches
From late May until early September of 2009 Archaeology Consultants,
Inc. provided monitoring services to Reim Construction during the placement of
the storm sewer and water supply pipes and for the removal of old pavement
prior to resurfacing. The original contract had to be modified when it was learned
that the old water supply piping had to be replaced. Altogether monitoring was
supplied for a total of 5750 linear feet. Monitoring was provided by two
archaeologists who were present during the actual rermoval or modification of
the subsurface sediments. Monitors observed the process and, when necessary,
recorded cultural features.
Very limited evidence of historic and/or prehistoric occupation was
observed during this monitoring, and no significant features or materials were
noted. Shallow, trash-filled depressions were encountered on Lincoln Street and
on Hidalgo Street. In both instances, these depressions orginated from the
orginal ground surface just below the caliche gravel base, and they contained
construction materials, small numbers of animal bones, and some scattered
artifacts that dated to the middle of the 20th century and later. These areas were
interpreted as filled potholes. In six other cases, isolated finds consisting of
modern bottle glass, discarded metal items, and three unmodified prehistoric
chert flakes were noted. No diagnostic items were observed or recorded.

16

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The archaeological investigations at San Ygnacio did not provide a great
deal of new or crucial data to our understanding of the cultural history of this
town. As is often the case with such monitoring and assessment projects, the
data will not support advanced modeling or theory building. The collected data
do support the degree of importance already attached to the San Ygnacio
Historic District and clarifies both the degree of disturbance already present and
the potential for additional finds. That data also strongly suggest that the
drainage improvement project is unlikely to adversely affect cultural resources,
as they are currently known.
Since chipped stone debitage is the second largest group of artifacts
collected during the excavation program, a considerable aboriginal presence in
San Ygnacio is evident. However, that evidence appears scattered and diffuse.
According to Black (1989), artifacts in South Texas are frequently concentrated in
restricted locales, and these locations are scattered and difficult to define without
large areal investigations. At San Ygnacio, our investigations were areally
restricted. Thus, the chipped stone materials are relatively enigmatic. The
presence of relatively large numbers of interior flakes (77% of the total) does
suggest that quarrying and/or collection of raw materials took place elsewhere.
Given the fact that raw materials are quite common in the erosional features
along the course of the Rio Grande and in feeder creeks and arroyos, this
concentration on finishing work might seem unusual. However, the sheer volume
of available raw materials would offer aboriginal tool manufacturers the chance to
be extremely selective and utilize only the highest quality raw materials. We
suspect that the ancient knappers carried out basic testing and preliminary
production at the collection site and returned to the project area where they
finished the tools.
The historic district in San Ygnacio is noteable for architectural styles that
date to the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s. However, the only artifact found during this
study that appears to date to this era is a cork type lip fragment from a brown
spirits bottle found in Level 1 of Test Unit 7. The rest of the bottle glass appears
to be of 20th century origin, and some of it is modern. Most of the whiteware
dates to the post Civil War period, and the majority appears to be 20 th century in
origin. The excavations did recover fourteen pieces of Mexican glazed earthen
utility ware, and some of this could date to the latter part of the 18 th century. This
type of earthenware is difficult to date, and it could also have been manufactured
in the recent past. There was no majolica.

17

The oldest metal pieces recovered are two cut nails that probably date
from the late 19th to early 20th centuries. In some areas these nails were
recycled making it difficult to assign a date to them. By way of comparison, the
window glass thickness data yields a mean manufacturing date of 1913-1914
(Moir and Bruseth 1987). These artifactual materials appear to represent a
predominantly early 20th century occupation. We suspect that this material
culture reflects not only a basic frugality or reuse philosophy on the part of the
19th century inhabitants of San Ygnacio, but they also depict a consistent pattern
of disturbance and refurbishment in the 20th century. As a result, the artifacts are
most useful as indicators of the degree of disturbance associated with those
deposits adjacent to the banquetas. Materials of recent origin are frequently
found in association with, or even below, items that are assumed to be older.
Such superpositioning is, of course, the hallmark of disturbed deposits and
suggests that placement of gutters or aprons is unlikely to adversely affect a
condition that already exists.
As suggested by the foregoing discussion, we would be remiss if we did
not question the rationale for leaving a twenty-four inch gap between the
remaining banquetas and the new curb and gutters. This will not only restrict
traffic movement along the already narrow streets, but it will also impede
drainage and actually force water back onto the banquetas. It is our opinion that
this would defeat the original purpose of protecting the remaining banquetas and
further hamper preservation efforts. Futhermore, such a procedure would expose
the banquetas to severe distubance as the current and already installed concrete
aprons are removed. Erosion and spalling of the vertical sandstone banqueta
members will almost certainly result.
