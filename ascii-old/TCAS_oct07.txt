have also asked to help with the Plano Archeology Fair on
October 6th. Followed by the Farmers Branch Archeology
Fair and the Gainesville Fair, both are happening on October 13th. Lastly in our region is the Denton Archeology Fair

October is

From an archeological perspective, the
month of October is always the busiest
time of the year for TCAS. And rightfully so, as it is officially Archeology
Awareness Month; designated by the
Texas Historical Commission. Every
weekend, throughout the state, there
are numerous events held for the public; with the fundamental goal to educate both adults and about the life
ways of previous cultures within our State.

OCTOBER PROGRAM

LAURIE MOSELeY
“The Parker County Poor Farm”
Laurie Moseley is the Presidentelect of the Texas Archeological
Society, and will take office at
the October annual meeting in
San Antonio. He is a long-time
volunteer archeological steward
of the Texas Historical Commission. He will be speaking about
work planned for the Parker
County Poor Farm located near
Weatherford. The Parker County Archeological Society will be doing site recording, oral history , and test excavation of at least one
prehistoric site on the Poor Farm property.

THE POOR FARM
In 1883, the Parker County Commissioners Court bought the 320-acre poor
farm for $1,900, payable in three annual payments. At that time, the
County Judge was A.J. Hunter, and the four commissioners were B.C.
Tarkinton, Joe C. Moore, Frank Barnett, and W.A. Massey. State law mandated help for indigent people, and the county was paying 38 people $3 to
$10 a month. Commissioner Moore said that the paupers were getting too
expensive, and so the court decided it could save money if it bought a farm,
on which the paupers could work for their keep. The farm operated for
many years until it was closed in the 1940's.
The Historical Marker for the Poor Farm reads: “Created in 1883, a
farm near this site housed the county's indigent citizens. Farm residents and some county convicts worked to grow crops and raise livestock. Although entire families were once housed at the farm, by the
1930s the residents were mostly elderly. Their barracks-style house
was moved to Weatherford in the 1940s after the farm was closed. A
small cemetery was created here, and contains one legible marker. Additional grave sites have been marked with bricks. The earliest documented burial is from 1904, and the last was in 1937. Texas Sesquicentennial 1836-1986.”

NAME THAT POINT

WILL RETURN NEXT MONTH WITH “THE HARRELL POINT CONTROVERSY”

SAN JACINTO ARTIFACT PART OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY MONTH
Holly Green / Item Correspondent / THE HUNTSVILL ITEM

During the month of October, Texas celebrates archeology month. But to Sandra Rogers, volunteer archeological steward with the Texas Historical Commission, member of the Texas Archeological Society
and collections registrar at the Sam Houston Museum, archeology is a part of everyday life.
Rogers slipped on a white glove and carefully picked up a breast plate engraved with the letters ‘BG’ from the San Jacinto Battlefield survey that is now on display in the Sam Houston Museum. “The letters stand for ‘Battalion Guerro,’”
Rogers said. “The Guerro Battalion is one of the battalions that came directly from the Alamo to San Jacinto. This artifact
is really special and these kind of findings are the exciting things that happen.”
Throughout the state, the Texas Historical Commission sponsors activities, including archeology fairs, mock digs, speakers and school presentations, and the Sam Houston Museum is offering Walker County residents several opportunities
to get involved.
Rogers invites the public to attend and join in the activities taking place in Huntsville. “The museum has been doing this
for many years,” Rogers said. “We bring in speakers and try to enlighten the public on projects going on in the state. We
know people are interested — we’re just hoping they come out.”
For the past three years, Rogers said the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Moore Archeological Consulting and archeological stewards from the THC have been recovering artifacts during an archeological survey of the battlefield of San
Jacinto.
“Many of the Mexican battalions that fought at the Alamo traveled to San Jacinto for the final battle,” Rogers said. “The
TP&WD has loaned these artifacts to the Sam Houston Museum for a San Jacinto battlefield artifacts exhibit to be displayed from Oct. 1-24 in the rotunda of the main museum building.”
The Collections Department of the Sam Houston Museum is sponsoring a guest speaker, Dr. Roger Moore of Moore Archeological Consulting Inc., to talk to the public. “Dr. Moore will discuss the past and future surveys and excavations
conducted at the San Jacinto battlefield,” Rogers said. “Attendance is free.”
The Sam Houston Museum will be inviting the fourth-grade students from Gibbs Elementary to its annual archeology fair
on Oct. 12, Rogers said. “The students will participate in various activities conducted by members of the Texas Archeological Society and museum staff,” Rogers said.
Seventh-grade Texas history students from Huntsville ISD will also get a chance to learn about archeology through a series of presentations given by Rogers. “I will be talking to students about my participation in numerous excavations
across the state, including the San Jacinto Battlefield survey which continues this fall,” Rogers said.
Rogers said there are 100 archeological stewards statewide working with professional archeologists from the THC.
“These stewards help landowners survey sites and catalog private collections,” Rogers said. “Archeological sites in Texas
are quickly disappearing due to illegal pothunting and development.” The THC publishes various informational pamphlets in an effort to dispel the many misconceptions held by the public about archeological sites, Rogers said.
“Many people believe that if a site is found on private land the state may take the land — not true,” Rogers said. “The
THC would like an opportunity to record the site but has no authority to seize property. It is our hope that by educating
the public sites can be studied rather than pilfered.”

Living history fair set for Oct. 6

The

Brenham Heritage Museum, County Historical Commission,
Arts Council of Washington County and other organizations
and underwriters are sponsoring a County and Living Archeology History Fair Saturday, Oct. 6 at the Brenham Heritage
Museum and the new fire truck museum downtown.
Hours are 9 a.m. to noon, and all activities are free. Visitors
will have an opportunity to learn things about Native Americans by participating in various activities and enjoying the
entertainment that will be in the new fire truck building.
The event features educational and fun activities such as
demonstrations of archeological techniques, including flintknapping and atlatl demonstrations.
The purposes of sponsoring an archeology fair are to promote awareness of Texas archeology and the role of these
organizations in the preservation of Texas’s prehistoric and
historic resources, organizers said.
“Archeology is not about digging up artifacts, but it is learning about as much as possible about the life ways of all the
people who lived in Texas, from Paleoindian times to the
present,” said Dr. Wilfred Dietrich, one of the organizers..

“For example, children will learn about the growing of cotton,
corn, grains, and other things. They will witness Sue Works working with her spinning wheel. The children will
be able to learn how the grain is crushed and used for cooking purposes. The children will witness the oldfashion way of cleaning clothes and hanging the clothes on the line to dry.”
A state archeologist will share with the children the work and show some of the fascinating sites in Washington County, encourage children to participate and have them to collect artifacts as petrified wood.
Brenham Heritage Museum has artifacts that are typical of historic sites and many photos that explain archeological sites, including original book of the rural schools in Washington County.
Other demonstrations include basket weaving, clues in dirt activity, stone tools, face painting, living history
demonstrations, music, pottery making, horseshoeing, Buffalo Soldiers, stone painting, storytelling and weaving.
Texas and American flags will also be given away.
An essay contest, based on the fair’s Native American theme, is open to 4th and 7th graders in public and private, along with home-schooled children. The top three winners in each category will be awarded cash prizes.
An art contest is open to all grades. Winners will be awarded a cash prize.

2007 Pecos Experience October 14-19
The Shumla School, located about 50 miles west of Del Rio on the Pecos River will host the 2007 Pecos Experience . Participants will join Drs. James Keyser and Carolyn Boyd as they investigate the local rock art, the lifeways
and technologies of the people who created that art, the archeology of the area, and local plants and their uses. Based
on last year’s Pecos Experience this will be an event not to be missed. Here is an overview of last year’s program:
October 15, 2006, began a week of adventure and discovery for 16 program participants. These people gathered to
explore many rock art sites located in the Lower Pecos region of Texas. Joining them in this discovery was noted archeologist and paleolithic rock-art expert, Dr. Jean Clottes. During the week participants also learned about the archeology of the Lower Pecos, native plants and their many uses, and primitive technologies used by Native Americans
who lived in the region thousands of years ago. A telescope was set up one evening and those who wished were able
to spend fascinating hours stargazing under the clear SHUMLA skies.
In addition to Dr. Clottes, participants heard lectures and discussions by Dr. Carolyn Boyd, Elton Prewitt, Dr. Phil Dering, Neal Stilley, Steve Norman, Brenda Norman, and other SHUMLA School instructors.
Volunteers during the week included SHUMLA School Board member Lacy Jemmott and her sister Summer. Lacy was
the camp cook and prepared incredible meals. Sarah Stilley was the other volunteer, providing hard work and a helping hand wherever needed during the week.
